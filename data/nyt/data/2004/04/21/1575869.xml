        <p>A tenuous peace deal between the American occupation forces and the embattled city of Falluja got off to a slow and sometimes chaotic start on Tuesday. A handful of families managed to return home, hundreds of people trying to were stranded along the road and Iraqi security forces whose loyalty was suspect only days ago lined up to return to patrol.</p>
        <p>For the marines surrounding the city there was little faith in the agreement, reached after two weeks of fierce street fighting and the discovery of vast caches of weapons.</p>
        <p>At their sprawling base in an old Iraqi Army camp nearby, commanders studied maps, picked out potential targets and avenues of attack and briefed their company and platoon officers.</p>
        <p>The occupation authorities have agreed to permit the return of about 50 families a day, shorten the curfew and let in medical and relief supplies. Given the extended nature of Iraqi families, there will be up to 25 people per family allowed, a marine officer said.</p>
        <p>Most important, and most dubious, in the marines' eyes, the Iraqi authorities in Falluja must persuade the insurgents to turn over their heavy weapons -- mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, rifles and other items. As of 6 p.m. local time, when the center running the cease-fire closed down, no weapons had been returned.</p>
        <p>At the center, a small compound with a cinder block wall, Lt. Col. Colin McNease, a Marine Corps civil affairs officer supervising the effort, said 42 families had been allowed in from the east side of the city and 10 more from the west.</p>
        <p>As word spread of the possibility of re-entry into the city, which is surrounded by a marine cordon, hundreds of people turned up at the center early in the morning. But the plan called for the Iraqi police and civil defense forces to be reorganized and sent out to vet the returnees at checkpoints. So the marines passed out food and water and told most to come back on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''It was kind of hectic,'' said Staff Sgt. Frank Ortega.</p>
        <p>For the Khawan family, the return to Falluja meant gathering up their 11 children from the school in the remote tribal area where they had sought refuge. It also meant a two-hour journey by rickety pickup truck along old farm roads.</p>
        <p>At the checkpoint outside town they, like many others, were prevented by American military police and the Iraqi police from going farther. The 50 families allotted for Tuesday had already passed through. By late afternoon vehicles were backed up on the road and the shoulder.</p>
        <p>The Iraqi police, in crisp blue uniforms and badges, stood to the side in groups, mingling with their fellow Iraqis. ''It's the Americans,'' said a policeman named Ali. ''They won't let us let them in.''</p>
        <p>Many families said they lacked identification papers that would allow them to return to the places they had just come from. The head of one family looked along the stretches of sand into the distance under a baking sun. ''We will sleep here in the desert,'' he said. ''With the scorpions and snakes.''</p>
        <p>During the fighting the Iraqi police and security forces simply evaporated, some presumably fleeing, others staying home and some -- no one knows how many -- going over to the insurgents.</p>
        <p>One battle at the railroad station pitted presumed members of the Civil Defense Force against the marines. Earlier, executives of Blackwater USA, the private security firm, said men in the uniforms of the Civil Defense Force had lured their four security guards into the fatal ambush that ended with the mutilation of the bodies.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, young Iraqi men who lined up this afternoon to sign up to return to duty were met with only a few perfunctory questions.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Joseph Wolfgeher of the Marines said 250 men signed up Tuesday, after seven reported on Monday and three on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of marines gathered on the base outside Falluja at midday Tuesday for a simple, moving memorial for one of their comrades, 22-year-old Cpl. Daniel R. Amaya of Odessa, Tex., who was killed in the city on April 11. He was leading his squad in an attack on a building from which the marines had been taking repeated, heavy fire.</p>
        <p>As the only one with a flashlight-equipped rifle, he went through the door first and saw that the situation was untenable. He was shot dead in the doorway as he shouted warnings, saving the rest of his men. Corporal Amaya has been recommended for a posthumous Bronze Star.</p>
        <p>Their young faces grim but dry-eyed, they listened to the chaplain, Capt. Robert Grove, read from Scripture. Then his comrades, sometimes haltingly, remembered a funny young man sometimes called Kung Fu who loved ice cream, yearned for a Camaro and was learning to be a leader. Several soldiers used language not generally heard in church.</p>
        <p>''I know nothing about psalms,'' said Sgt. Maj. Dave Howell, the battalion's gruff, hardened, bull-necked senior noncommissioned officer. ''I couldn't paraphrase the Bible. I would be a hypocrite to do so. Stoicism is what's called for. Keep your heads up. You can't allow this to slow you down. Do you understand me?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir,'' the marines said.</p>
        <p>Corporal Amaya's Third Platoon gathered alone to speak of their brotherhood. ''I love all of you like family, just as I love Corporal Amaya,'' said their platoon sergeant, Staff Sgt. Michael L. Hayes.</p>
        <p>But first they all stood at rigid attention as a loudspeaker played ''The Marines' Hymn'' and then the haunting notes of taps.</p>
        <p>Then one by one they filed by in the traditional military farewell, Corporal Amaya's rifle upright on its bayonet, his helmet balanced on the stock, his boots in front.</p>
        <p>As each passed, they gently touched his helmet.</p>
