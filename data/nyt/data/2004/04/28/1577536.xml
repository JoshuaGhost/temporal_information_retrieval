        <p>Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi paraded into the heart of Europe on Tuesday to announce Libya's official return from the diplomatic outback of ''liberation struggles'' to the center stage of international cooperation.</p>
        <p>''Libya, which led the liberation movement in the third world, has decided to lead the peace movement all over the world,'' said Colonel Qaddafi, or Brother Guide, as he is known at home. He was swathed in his signature brown blanket and backed by four female bodyguards wearing close-fitting, blue and black paramilitary uniforms.</p>
        <p>It was his first visit outside Africa or the Arab world since attending a summit meeting of nonaligned nations in Belgrade nearly 15 years ago. The Libyans arrived in two planes, one for the colonel and his bodyguards and another for his white stretch Mercedes limousine.</p>
        <p>Colonel Qaddafi took over Val Duchesse, a sprawling state-owned suburban estate, putting up his black Bedouin tent on the emerald grounds where he received a parade of well-wishers from the African Union. The visitors carried Qaddafi posters and celebratory banners, much like a rock star's fan club.</p>
        <p>He arrived in time for a brief meeting with European commissioners before having lunch with the president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi. Chief on the agenda for the Libyan leader's first official visit to the European Union was his country's eventual membership in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, an initiative that loosely ties together the union with countries bordering the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>During lunch, Mr. Prodi questioned the colonel on whether Libya was willing to adopt the partnership's so-called Barcelona Declaration without preconditions, which would require the country to open its economy and do away with trade barriers. The declaration was adopted by more than two dozen countries in 1995 and seeks to stimulate trade across North Africa, now blocked by closed borders.</p>
        <p>By the time the men reached their date souffl√©, though, it was clear that Colonel Qaddafi was not ready to make serious commitments. The men agreed to form committees to study the matter further.</p>
        <p>After the lunch, Colonel Qaddafi appeared before an eager press corps accustomed to covering colorless bureaucrats. Someone began whistling the theme song to the film ''The Godfather'' before doors at the side of the room swung open and an unsmiling Colonel Qaddafi strode in, his head held high at an imperious angle.</p>
        <p>He soon loosened up, however, mugging for photographers when he discovered that a move to adjust his cap set off a storm of camera flashes. When it came his turn to speak, he ad-libbed instead of delivering a brief prepared statement, as had Mr. Prodi. What followed was a half-hour of boasting and scolding and disjointed exposition.</p>
        <p>He lectured Europe on its colonial misadventures in Africa and promised to use the Mediterranean as a bridge for peace between the continents. He argued that his past support for freedom fighters had been misconstrued as terrorism, and said that by the same measure Nelson Mandela would top the list of the world's terrorists.</p>
        <p>''Now the time has come to reap the fruits of this armed struggle,'' Colonel Qaddafi said, ''namely peace, stability and development.''</p>
        <p>He said he had started his peace campaign by voluntarily dismantling his effort to build unconventional weapons and called on the rest of the world -- singling out the United States and China -- to follow suit. ''My belief is that the noose will gradually tighten for those who possess such weapons,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he hoped he would not be prompted to go back to his old ways. ''Hopefully, nothing will force us to go back to the days when we used our cars and explosive belts,'' he said without elaborating.</p>
        <p>But Colonel Qaddafi spent most of his remarks explaining how he could not stop the flow of sub-Saharan migrants from traversing his country to get to Europe. He argued that the West must help Libya police its borders and invest in development projects that will keep migrants on the African continent.</p>
        <p>The colonel has taken deliberate steps to rehabilitate his government from rogue-state status, capped by his agreement four months ago to open the country to United Nations weapons inspectors and to voluntarily dismantle a nascent but expensive nuclear arms program.</p>
        <p>As a reward, the United States eased economic sanctions against the country on Friday, and Libya has wasted little time capitalizing on its new status. On Saturday, the National Oil Corporation brokered its first sale to an American oil company in nearly 20 years. On Monday, the Washington-based law firm Butera &amp; Andrews announced a strategic partnership with a Libyan firm to help American companies do business there.</p>
