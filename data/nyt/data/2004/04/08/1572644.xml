        <p>The Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle has named Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., as its agency of record, handling assignments to help support its retail business in North America.</p>
        <p>Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Wieden &amp; Kennedy and the New York office of Bartle Bogle Hegarty.</p>
        <p>The review was prompted by a conflict created when the previous agency, LB Works in Chicago, was absorbed by a sibling, Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe.</p>
        <p>Burnett could not work for Starbucks because it creates campaigns for McDonald's, one of the country's largest coffee retailers.</p>
