        <p>A private consultant's report on accusations of misconduct against Councilman Allan W. Jennings Jr. concludes that the Queens councilman created a hostile work environment for female employees and wrongfully fired one of them, according to a City Council official.</p>
        <p>The closely guarded report, which was reviewed yesterday by members of the Council's Standards and Ethics Committee, will likely lead the committee to recommend disciplinary action against Mr. Jennings, the official said, adding that the committee could meet as soon as the end of the week to discuss the findings.</p>
        <p>''The specific charges the committee is likely to recommend are creating a hostile work environment, wrongful termination and retaliatory termination,'' said the official, who is knowledgeable about the committee's work and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Jennings declined to comment yesterday on the consultant's report, as did a spokesman for Gifford Miller, the Council speaker.</p>
        <p>Newsday, citing ''Council sources,'' reported on Friday that Mr. Jennings would face disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Council official said that the report of the inquiry by ADR Associates/JAMS, a mediation and consulting firm hired by the Council in January, supported at least some of the allegations by two women who once worked for Mr. Jennings.</p>
        <p>In complaints filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the former aides accused Mr. Jennings of making sexist comments, forcing them to clean his home on work time, and presenting one of them with a doll with an exaggerated penis, officials familiar with the complaints have said. One of the women has also claimed that she was fired after rejecting the councilman's sexual advances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings has denied the accusations.</p>
        <p>Any discipline meted out by the Council would likely be limited to censure, a fine or other action far short of impeachment, according to a council member familiar with the report's findings. It is also likely to include anti-harassment training.</p>
        <p>The report of the investigation is confidential, and to avoid media leaks the Council took the unusual step of mailing the findings to the nine members of the ethics committee at their homes over the weekend.In addition to the Council's investigation, the city's Department of Investigation is also conducting an inquiry into the accusations against Mr. Jennings.</p>
