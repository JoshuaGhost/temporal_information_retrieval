        <p>MANY people spend their retirement taking care of someone else, and that person has usually been a spouse. But as retirement becomes less of life's last lap and more of a post-middle-age transition, a growing number of people are deciding in their later years to care for others by becoming nurses. Accelerated nursing programs have nearly tripled since 1990, and have made it easier and quicker to earn a nursing degree. Here are the observations of five people who have chosen this path.</p>

        <p>LAURA NOVAK</p>
        <p>MICHAEL GREENE</p>
        <p>Michael Greene, 55, has been working as an adult nurse practitioner for two years. He shares a private practice with a doctor in the Castro District of San Francisco. When he was 51, Mr. Greene moved across the country to enroll at the Yale University School of Nursing.</p>
        <p>All I had ever wanted to do was take care of people. But growing up in the 50's, girls became nurses and boys became doctors. So I set my sights on medical school. But I got wait-listed. I got a doctoral fellowship in biology at Georgetown.</p>
        <p>Three years later, I was just kind of burned out by the process, so I got a job as a bank teller. That temporary job turned into a career in mortgage banking and finance.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1996, I left. I had enough money in the bank. I met a partner, a man who had left a career in real estate and law to become a nurse. That was a real eye opener for me. There was this possibility that maybe I could do what I always wanted to do.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, H.I.V. and AIDS came along, and I lost friends and a partner. I wanted to be part of taking care of these people. I volunteered at AIDS organizations but that wasn't enough. I realized that becoming a nurse practitioner would be perfect for me without having to go to medical school.</p>
        <p>I spent three years at Yale. It was difficult. I wasn't sure I was going to succeed. Our family broke up. We were bicoastal for three years. But we're stronger for it now.</p>
        <p>I didn't appreciate how intense and demanding this work would be. You are involved with the most intimate details of people's lives. People look to you for a level of expertise and responsibility that I think I'm much more able to deliver with maturity and experience.</p>
        <p>JEAN KRUEGER</p>
        <p>Jean Krueger, 62, is a registered nurse in the public health department of Siskiyou County in Northern California. She earned her bachelor's degree in nursing from California State University at Chico just before her 61st birthday. She said she considers herself ''two-thirds old'' and hopes to spend the last third of her life doing what she has always wanted to do.</p>
        <p>When I graduated from high school in 1960, I entered a nursing program and stayed in it for about three months, but I quit because I got married. I raised a family and went to work as a bookkeeper and an auditor for 22 years. In 1997 I retired. My husband died in 1989.</p>
        <p>I decided to work as a travel agent. But that was when the airlines decided to cut commissions, and so I thought I'd go to college. I was 57 years old. I went to Chico State, about 160 miles from my home.</p>
        <p>There's lots of variety. Today I worked in an immunization clinic. Yesterday I tested preschoolers for hearing and vision. My primary desk job is doing case management for California Children's Services.</p>
        <p>I came from a position of having everything dictated to me and I was told what to do. So I think my self-confidence was not nurtured. I'm still growing. I'm still learning. Life experiences make it easier in nursing and so does having raised children and losing a spouse.</p>
        <p>MAE LIU</p>
        <p>Mae Liu, 53, is a first-year student at Samuel Merritt College in Oakland, Calif. By age 55, she expects to be licensed as a registered nurse with a master's degree in case management. She is single with no children. She previously worked as an administrator at a health maintenance organization until she was laid off in 1997. She considered herself retired. Then a confluence of events propelled her into what she calls ''a new way to retire.''</p>
        <p>Around the time I stopped working, I began volunteering at Children's Hospital in Oakland. I moved to the neonatal intensive care unit. I loved being around the babies.</p>
        <p>Then the stock market tanked so my retirement nest egg wasn't worth what it had been. And I found that the volunteering, while satisfying, wasn't doing it for mental stimulation. I felt I wanted to do more for the babies, but I wasn't qualified.</p>
        <p>Nursing school has been intellectually demanding and all-consuming. The first semester was primarily academic. And the second is more hands-on and I can see what my eventual role will be.</p>
        <p>This work is very high risk. I think if I were 23 or 25, I would be really panicked, but because I'm older, I have years of dealing with people. I have the kind of people skills, the ability to empathize, that is important to being a nurse.</p>
        <p>I feel this has been the right choice. This program will get me to the point where I can do the nursing part time -- and looking at my age when I finish, that will be ideal -- and work with the babies in particular.</p>
        <p>JACQUELYN KHAN</p>
        <p>Jacquelyn Khan will turn 63 later this month, and a few weeks after that she will receive her bachelor's degree in nursing from the College of Nursing at Wayne State University in Detroit. This will be her fourth academic degree and her third career. She began her professional life as a social worker and then joined the Detroit Board of Education in 1968 as a truant officer. She retired in 1999.</p>
        <p>I knew I would do something else and I knew nursing was that something else. My mother had been a licensed practical nurse. When I was a truant officer in the 60's and 70's, I was running into people who couldn't live their lives healthily. Asthma was keeping the kids out of school. The moms were overweight and overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>To get into nursing school, I needed prerequisites. So while working for the board of education, I took night classes. By the time I retired, I was ready to enter nursing school.</p>
        <p>I sat for the R.N. licensing exam on March 20, 2000. I remember the date because it was the first day of spring, and I believe in starting everything new and positive in the spring. When I turned 60, I decided to get my bachelor's in nursing.</p>
        <p>I'm the oldest student in class. I'm not sure the others even know because I've always had a youthful attitude toward life. I work two days a week in cardiac intensive care at Detroit Receiving Hospital. At school, I'm in wonderful classes where we do our clinical work in the community. We help provide care for the homeless. We're out at the county jail.</p>
        <p>It's easy to do this as an older person. It's easy for me to communicate with patients across social groups and ages.</p>
        <p>WENDY WANK</p>
        <p>Wendy Wank, 55, rides a motorcycle to the University of California at San Francisco, where she is halfway through an accelerated master's in nursing program. She spent much of her adult life as a documentary film editor. After working for a Buddhist organization in Thailand for a year, Ms. Wank volunteered at a Zen hospice in San Francisco. That is when she began casting about for a career change.</p>
        <p>Someone called me to work on a film. It was only a day's work, so I said I would do it. It was about a young boy whose mother died of breast cancer and his grieving process.</p>
        <p>I knew I was going to become a nurse.</p>
        <p>A week later, I started prerequisites. I got my R.N. degree in 2002 and worked here at U.C.S.F. for a year before continuing on for my master's. I never really wanted to work in a hospital, but everything is on the med-surg floor. People always say you should have that experience because you see a lot of different sicknesses.</p>
        <p>I worked a month on nights, a month on days on med-surg. On that floor there were end-of-life suites. Pain management is a big issue. You are dealing with people's fears. You can talk realistically about death. If I was younger and someone was dying, I would find it depressing.</p>
        <p>Now that I am older, I have different feelings. Everyone is going to die, and if you can help make it a better death, there is something moving about that.</p>
        <p>I'll be done with my master's degree in 2005. I'll be a general nurse practitioner with a minor in H.I.V. I am also interested in end of life. What made me interested in both these courses was my volunteering work. But when I was a volunteer, I didn't know anything about the medical stuff. Now, as a nurse, I'm the person they talk to, who makes sure they get pain or comfort medication.</p>
        <p>I feel like one day of work in this job is like six months of satisfaction in my old job.</p>
