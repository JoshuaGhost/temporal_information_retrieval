        <p>After days of being pressed by Republicans, Senator John Kerry on Wednesday released his military records, which showed uniformly positive evaluations from his commanders in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>After balking Monday on a promise to release his full Navy record, Mr. Kerry posted more than 140 pages of documents on his campaign Web site, www.johnkerry.com, in a move that largely silenced critics on a part of his life that has been central to his presidential hopes.</p>

        <p>After days of being pressed by Republicans, Senator John Kerry on Wednesday released his military records, which showed uniformly positive evaluations from his commanders in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>After balking Monday on a promise to release his full Navy record, Mr. Kerry posted more than 140 pages of documents on his campaign Web site, www.johnkerry.com, in a move that largely silenced critics on a part of his life that has been central to his presidential hopes.</p>
        <p>The records depict many instances of bravery in the face of enemy fire and describe a young officer who is smart, articulate and decisive. For example, George M. Elliot, his commander in early 1969, wrote, ''In a combat environment often requiring independent, decisive action, Lt. j.g. Kerry was unsurpassed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Elliot added, ''His bearing and appearance are above reproach.''</p>
        <p>Even a commander who, 36 years after the fact, questioned a Purple Heart awarded to Mr. Kerry in 1968, recorded no reservations at the time. The officer, Grant W. Hibbard, a lieutenant commander during Mr. Kerry's five-month tour in Vietnam, told The Boston Globe last week that the wound for which Mr. Kerry won his first Purple Heart was no more than a small scratch.</p>
        <p>But there was nothing negative about Mr. Kerry in an evaluation that Mr. Hibbard wrote two weeks after that incident.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Hibbard wrote, Mr. Kerry was under his command for too short a time to evaluate him fully. Of 16 categories for rating, including professional knowledge, moral courage and loyalty, Mr. Hibbard checked ''not observed'' in 12. Mr. Hibbard gave Mr. Kerry the highest rating of ''one of the top few'' in three categories -- initiative, cooperation and personal behavior. He gave Mr. Kerry the second-best rating, ''above the majority,'' in military bearing. Reached Wednesday at his retirement home in Florida, Mr. Hibbard said he had no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry became a lightning rod for a number of Vietnam veterans after he became a prominent critic of the war and said American soldiers, including himself, had committed atrocities.</p>
        <p>The military records offered no hint of atrocities, but repeatedly cited Mr. Kerry's initiative in battle and patrician manner.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Kerry was an ensign on the Gridley on his first Vietnam tour in 1967, his commander described him as ''intelligent, mature and rich in educational background and experience,'' as well as ''polished, tactful and outgoing'' and ''a brilliant conversationalist.''</p>
        <p>''He uses the English language expertly, both orally and in writing,'' the commander wrote.</p>
        <p>A few months later, another commander was similarly impressed.</p>
        <p>''His division's morale is one of the best on the ship due to his dynamic leadership,'' the officer wrote. ''He is a polished diplomat at ease in distinguished company'' and ''is impressive in appearance and always immaculate.''</p>
        <p>Months later, Mr. Kerry's bearing struck another reviewer. ''He presents a very neat appearance and meets people well,'' that captain wrote. ''For his age and experience, he writes and speaks exceedingly well.''</p>
        <p>The records include citations for medals like the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Hearts.</p>
        <p>By Wednesday afternoon, accounts of Mr. Kerry's valor in combat were all over television.</p>
        <p>Terry Holt, a spokesman for President Bush's campaign, said the issue was never Mr. Kerry's military service but what he said was Mr. Kerry's hypocrisy in calling for full disclosure of various aspects of Mr. Bush's presidency while Mr. Kerry had not released his own military records or the tax returns of his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry.</p>
        <p>''What this reinforces is something very basic about John Kerry -- that he only responds to political pressure,'' Mr. Holt said. ''We're going to hold him accountable. But that doesn't mean that it's one of the main themes of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>A senior adviser to Mr. Kerry, Michael Meehan, said that much of the information had been released earlier to newspapers. Still unreleased are Mr. Kerry's medical records, which Mr. Meehan said the campaign was collecting. Asked whether the campaign intended to release those records, Mr. Meehan said: ''You can't release what you don't have. Let us continue to collect the information from 35 to 40 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Lanny J. Davis, a Washington lawyer who worked on damage control for the Clinton White House and who supports Mr. Kerry, said the senator had no choice but to release the records.</p>
        <p>''The public and the political process today will not countenance privacy issues, and that includes all aspects of your biography,'' said Mr. Davis, who wrote ''Truth To Tell: Tell It Early, Tell It All, Tell It Yourself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said the question of Mrs. Heinz Kerry's tax returns was a ''gray area'' that the couple would have to decide for themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis faulted Mr. Bush's campaign for criticizing Mr. Kerry, saying the move backfired because it led to obvious comparisons between Mr. Kerry's enlisting in the military while Mr. Bush was in the National Guard and avoided combat.</p>
        <p>When Democrats accused Mr. Bush this year of being AWOL for part of his tour of duty, he released guard records. But the documents did not make clear how often Mr. Bush reported for duty.</p>
