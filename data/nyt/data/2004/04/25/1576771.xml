      <abstract>
        <p>Jack Neff letter scores Debra Borchert for her reaction to supermarket worker who is mentally retarded (April 11 Lives column)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As the father of an autistic child, I found Debra Borchert's discussion of her discomfort in dealing with a disabled grocery bagger puzzling and disturbing (Lives, April 11). Puzzling because Borchert should know better, given her experience with her own siblings. Disturbing because despite that experience, she perpetuates the image of the disabled as scary.</p>
        <p>Borchert's problem with the bagger might have been easily solved without recourse to a shopping cart. The man obviously had good verbal skills. Surely telling him that his standing so close made her uncomfortable and asking him to move back a little would stand a chance of working -- and help him improve his social skills.</p>
