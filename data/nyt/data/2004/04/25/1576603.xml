        <p>Japan's busiest international air link -- between Tokyo and Seoul -- has never deserved to be called an air bridge. Flights leave every 20 minutes, and although passengers spend two hours aloft, the total journey, from downtown hotel to downtown hotel, takes seven hours, if you're lucky.

        <p>TOKYO  A shorter hop to Seoul, and a way to float by traffic</p>
        <p>Japan's busiest international air link -- between Tokyo and Seoul -- has never deserved to be called an air bridge. Flights leave every 20 minutes, and although passengers spend two hours aloft, the total journey, from downtown hotel to downtown hotel, takes seven hours, if you're lucky. This is because the flights link two international airports about 30 miles from their city centers.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 30, a true air bridge began, linking downtown airports and cutting hotel-to-hotel travel time to as little as four hours. Now the prized commodity of the business traveler, a seat on a flight between Haneda (Tokyo) and Kimpo (Seoul) requires a reservation.</p>
        <p>Authorities were cautious about allowing international flights between two domestic airports, allotting only one flight a day each way to each of four carriers: Japan Airlines, ANA, Asiana and Korean Air.</p>
        <p>Haneda is reachable by a pleasant monorail, which rocks along past some of Tokyo's largely hidden port scenery: marinas, canals, ship museums and the ships in the bay. A runway stretches alongside the waves.</p>
        <p>Part of the attraction of the new air link is the feeling that each airport has a ''toy'' terminal for the foreign flights, complete with minicheck-in counters, immigration desks and departure gates (although a new international terminal at Haneda is set for completion in December). By contrast, at the international airports, Narita for Tokyo and Incheon for Seoul, travelers face long lines and hikes the lengths of football fields.</p>
        <p>A recent government-paid advertisement for Tokyo alerted American newspaper readers: ''It may never be a beauty like Paris and great swaths of it are heart-stoppingly ugly but Tokyo is a surprisingly livable city.''</p>
        <p>For visitors and residents who tire of the city's gray cement boxes, Tokyo Water Cruise offers an affordable way to reconnect with a pleasant side of the city. Popular in spring to admire flowering shrubs along river banks and in summer to escape the city's evening heat, the boats offer such precious rarities as distant horizons and harbor views of a city that has largely forgotten its maritime roots. In Tokyo, Japan's busiest container port, many residents go for months without seeing the ocean.</p>
        <p>To see spring flowers, the Sumida River line runs a 40-minute cruise between Asakusa and Hamarikyu garden, a former feudal hunting estate on the edge of Tokyo Bay. This leisurely river run costs $6 and cuts through downtown Tokyo, passing under 12 bridges, many of them historic.</p>
        <p>Of the six bay itineraries, the most popular for visitors is the Harbor Cruise, running from a pier near Hamarikyu garden to Odaiba Seaside Park. It takes about 90 minutes and costs $9.50 round trip. Passing near Rainbow Bridge, passengers are surrounded by a view of Tokyo. With the last boat leaving Hamarikyu at 7:55 p.m., summer passengers can enjoy cool breezes and the city lights, a panorama that can be stunning.</p>
        <p>For information, check the cruise company's English-language Web site, which is at www.suijobus.co.jp.</p>
