        <p>The Westchester County Department of Health will test about 100 staff members and students at Yonkers High School for tuberculosis after their exposure to a student who has the disease, said Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman for the department.</p>
        <p>Tuberculosis, a communicable bacterial infection of the lungs, is potentially fatal. It usually causes a cough and fever, and is spread through the air from an infectious person to others, although a long period of close contact -- many hours or days -- is generally required for transmission. Despite what the county is describing as ''a relatively low risk'' that fellow students or staff have been infected, it is recommending that those who shared a classroom or otherwise had significant contact with the victim undergo skin testing.</p>

        <p>The Westchester County Department of Health will test about 100 staff members and students at Yonkers High School for tuberculosis after their exposure to a student who has the disease, said Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman for the department.</p>
        <p>Tuberculosis, a communicable bacterial infection of the lungs, is potentially fatal. It usually causes a cough and fever, and is spread through the air from an infectious person to others, although a long period of close contact -- many hours or days -- is generally required for transmission. Despite what the county is describing as ''a relatively low risk'' that fellow students or staff have been infected, it is recommending that those who shared a classroom or otherwise had significant contact with the victim undergo skin testing.</p>
        <p>Even if a test result is positive, it does not necessarily indicate that an individual is sick or able to spread the disease, the health department said. Such a result, however, does indicate contact with the disease, and treatment may therefore be necessary to stop the infection from progressing. Preventive treatment involves daily medication taken over the course of months. The department said it would follow standard procedure and test again in three months.</p>
        <p>Westchester typically has about 60 active cases of tuberculosis a year, ''and this year is pretty typical,'' Ms. Landrigan said.</p>
