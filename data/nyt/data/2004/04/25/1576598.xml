        <p>SINGAPORE  A museum for a polyglot city is one of many reborn buildings</p>
        <p>On the Singapore River steps away from the spot where Sir Stamford Raffles is supposed to have first landed, the British used Indian convicts to build Empress Place in the 1860's. Named for Queen Victoria, it housed part of the colonial administration, and later served as headquarters for independent Singapore's immigration department.</p>
        <p>Fittingly enough, Empress Place is now a museum celebrating the ancient cultures that collided to create the polyglot that is modern Singapore. Indian tourists are now pouring into Singapore, along with tour groups from China, shoppers from Indonesia and backpackers from Britain. Tourism here has largely recovered since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia last year.</p>
        <p>Empress Place was reopened in March 2003 as a second branch of the Asian Civilizations Museum, and displays a permanent collection of artifacts from China, India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Outside, along the river, is one of Singapore's most pleasant restaurants, IndoChine, where the lights of Boat Quay serve as a romantic backdrop for dinner.</p>
        <p>The Asian Civilizations Museum, Empress Place, (65) 6332-7798, www.museum.org.sg/ACM/acm.shtml, is open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., except on Monday, when it opens at 1 p.m., and Friday, open until 9 p.m. The original branch, (65) 6332-3015, in an old school at 39 Armenian Street, contains exhibits from Singapore's Malay-Chinese community, the Peranakan. Admission to Empress Place is $3, the old branch $1.85, at $1.7 Singapore to the United States dollar. At IndoChine, (65) 6339-1720, fax (65) 6339-0420, dinner for two with wine is $105.</p>
        <p>Singapore's imaginative rethinking of historic buildings continues next door to Empress Place, in the Old Parliament House, built in 1827. After parliament relocated to newer digs in 1999, the building was renovated as part of a general makeover of Singapore's colonial waterfront that installed the Fullerton Hotel in an old post office, and the distinctive Esplanade-Theaters on the Bay, a collection of performing-arts spaces farther downstream.</p>
        <p>Last month, the Old Parliament House was inaugurated anew as the Arts House, a cozy complement to the Esplanade designed to demonstrate Singapore's commitment to reviving its artistic life as its commercial muscle falls under China's shadow. The Parliament's old chamber, with its high-backed leather chairs, has been left intact, with only a simple stage added. Other rooms have become a gallery, recital room and theater. Now, instead of political debate, it is host to plays, art films and concerts.</p>
        <p>The Arts House, (65) 6332-6900, fax (65) 6336-3021, at 1 Old Parliament Lane, lists its events at www.theartshouse.com.sg.</p>
        <p>Farther away, workers are converting the palace of Singapore's erstwhile sultan into a new Malay Heritage Center. After the sultan sold his domain to the British, his descendants vainly pursued claims to the surrounding property. Their palace fell into disrepair; eventually the family was evicted.</p>
        <p>Just outside the palace gates, the Yellow Mansion once occupied by the sultan's chief minister is now Tepak Sireh, a Malay restaurant, named after the traditional boxes used to hold betel nut. Tepak Sireh caters wedding receptions and also offers a delicious lunch and dinner buffet (alcohol is not served). Just pile some rice onto your plate and then choose from selections ranging from mutton curry to prawn sambal.</p>
        <p>Tepak Sireh, 73 Sultan Gate, (65) 6396-4373, fax (65) 6396-0373, is open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Buffet dinner for two, $26. No alcohol.</p>
