        <p>SEVERAL weeks ago, the organizers of the third annual TriBeCa Film Festival realized that they had a scheduling problem: they had planned an outdoor movie screening for the evening of May 6, during the very same moment NBC would be broadcasting the final episode of ''Friends.'' ''Why be in competition with 'Friends'?'' said Jane Rosenthal, the movie producer who is one of the festival's four co-founders. So the screening was moved to another evening. In its place, on the same outdoor screen, the ''Friends'' episode will be broadcast.</p>
        <p>Film festivals -- known for black-clad audiences, velvet-rope attitude and insider-deal-brokering -- don't usually bend over backward to accommodate laugh-tracked sitcoms. But the TriBeCa Film Festival is used to this kind of cheerful accommodation. In its inaugural year, the director George Lucas told Robert De Niro, another of the festival's co-founders, that he would be willing to preview ''Attack of the Clones,'' the upcoming ''Star Wars'' installment, at the festival but warned that the movie might not be completed in time. According to Craig Hatkoff, Ms. Rosenthal's husband and another festival co-founder, his wife's immediate reaction was, ''Well, move the festival.'' They did.</p>

        <p>SEVERAL weeks ago, the organizers of the third annual TriBeCa Film Festival realized that they had a scheduling problem: they had planned an outdoor movie screening for the evening of May 6, during the very same moment NBC would be broadcasting the final episode of ''Friends.''

        <p>Film festivals -- known for black-clad audiences, velvet-rope attitude and insider-deal-brokering -- don't usually bend over backward to accommodate laugh-tracked sitcoms. But the TriBeCa Film Festival is used to this kind of cheerful accommodation. In its inaugural year, the director George Lucas told Robert De Niro, another of the festival's co-founders, that he would be willing to preview ''Attack of the Clones,'' the upcoming ''Star Wars'' installment, at the festival but warned that the movie might not be completed in time. According to Craig Hatkoff, Ms. Rosenthal's husband and another festival co-founder, his wife's immediate reaction was, ''Well, move the festival.'' They did.</p>
        <p>Such pragmatic, populist decisions help explain how the TriBeCa Film Festival has become one of the fastest-growing cultural institutions in New York. This year's festival, budgeted at $15 million and featuring 250 feature-length and short films over nine days, will begin on May 1. Around the same time, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is expected to announce its decision about which cultural institutions will participate in a new cultural center planned for ground zero -- and the film festival, which has been short-listed as a potential programmer for the space, will likely play a role. It is expanding with such alacrity and brawn that it's sometimes hard to remember that it is only two years old, or that one of this year's biggest draws will be a screening of the shamelessly lightweight Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen adolescent caper movie, ''New York Minute.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the many film festivals that have started in obscurity and only slowly developed a cachet, TriBeCa began with a flash of celebrity. The festival's founding goal was to lure New Yorkers back downtown, to reinvigorate the neighborhood's economy and spirits after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Working quickly, and following a primary mission that was civic rather than artistic, the organizers came up with a festival that might be described as quirkily broad -- or hopelessly unfocused. How else to explain a program that last year featured a sing-along to ''Grease,'' and this year will include an original copy of the Declaration of Independence on display at Federal Hall? ''It's hard to describe how it all fits together,'' said Mr. Hatkoff. ''But it's very much -- throw 27 different ideas an hour, two stick, 25 we throw out.''</p>
        <p>To the organizers, the festival's lack of focus is its strongest suit, giving it a popular appeal that more-established institutions lack. ''Every place has a women's film festival, and a Jewish film festival, and a Latino film festival, which are all very important,'' said Peter Scarlet, the festival's executive director. ''We have a festival that can bring everyone into the tent.'' He continued: ''We are committed to overcoming the sense that a film festival is a wholesale experience, where you have to be a member of that trade to get in. This is retail. You can walk in off the street.''</p>
        <p>Robert De Niro agreed. ''We have always been about being a serious festival,'' he said, ''but one that's not taking itself too seriously, where it becomes elitist or snobbish or super-serious.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenthal said: ''The festival reflects what the city is. So if you're interested in that midnight movie you can do that, but if you prefer to hear Marty Scorsese talk about music in the movies, you can do that, and if you want to go to the Mary-Kate and Ashley movie with your 10-year-old you can do that too.''</p>
        <p>If the TriBeCa festival's power is hidden beneath a deceptively frothy exterior, then it has something in common with Ms. Rosenthal, who for years has been known as Mr. De Niro's business partner, but whose energy and vision drive much of the festival's expansion. ''She's kind of like the main person who things revolve around, and that I rely on to get anything done,'' said Mr. De Niro. Ms. Rosenthal, 47, is tall, with big round eyes, a girlishly flipped haircut, and a soft, high-pitched voice. She spent a decade working in movie and mini-series production (''Adventures in Babysitting,''  ''The Women's Room'') in Los Angeles before Martin Scorsese (the fourth co-founder of the festival) recommended her to Mr. De Niro in 1989. ''I thought the most important thing was someone who he could be comfortable with, and who could get the job done whatever the job became,'' said Mr. Scorsese. In partnership with Ms. Rosenthal, the remote, prickly star of films like ''Raging Bull'' and ''Taxi Driver'' has transformed himself into a multiplex crowd-pleaser with comedies like ''Analyze This'' and ''Meet the Parents.'' Ms. Rosenthal even convinced him to play Fearless Leader in the ill-fated ''The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'' Call her influence a dumbing down or a democratizing force; either way, it dramatically elevated Mr. De Niro's box office grosses.</p>
        <p>But from the start, the De Niro-Rosenthal partnership was about real estate as well as movies. With a grimace, Ms. Rosenthal recalled Mr. De Niro's assurance that ''if it doesn't work out with movies, you could always hostess at the restaurant'' -- meaning TriBeCa Grill, located in the TriBeCa Film Center, a former coffee warehouse that Mr. De Niro converted into glamorous office and restaurant space. It was through Mr. De Niro and the Film Center that Ms. Rosenthal met Mr. Hatkoff, a real estate entrepreneur interested in economic development.</p>
        <p>''It was one of those traditional New York stories,'' Mr. Hatkoff said. ''It really started from the real estate angle.'' (Oddly, Mr. Hatkoff and Ms. Rosenthal, TriBeCa's ardent champions, live on the Upper West Side. ''My husband wouldn't move downtown,'' she said of her relocation 10 years ago. ''I didn't sell my loft in TriBeCa until my first daughter was a year and a half old.'')</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Rosenthal, who is simultaneously preparing the festival, releasing several films, producing another and casting a Las Vegas stage musical, Mr. Hatkoff is a multi-hyphenate New Yorker. In addition to his real estate work and his position at the festival, Mr. Hatkoff is also a trustee of the New York City Schools Construction Authority, the managing partner of a children's entertainment company and the author of a rock opera about astronomy. Together, he and Ms. Rosenthal created a children's book, ''Cesar's Amazing Journey,'' about a tree-frog who wanders around New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenthal said she and Mr. De Niro had talked about founding a local cultural event for years, but they knew that ''the world didn't need another film festival.'' (Mr. Scarlet said that when he first heard about their project he was equally skeptical: ''I had always wanted to create a product called Festicide, which would prevent the weed-like growth of new film festivals.'') Sept. 11 changed all that, suddenly creating a need for civic-boosting, arts-enhancing, tourism-friendly events. ''There were still emergency vehicles on the street,'' Mr. Hatkoff recalls. ''They were working on the site; you could still smell the burning rubber in the air; no one had been out on the street in any kind of celebratory way; and here is Jane saying, 'Let's put on a film festival!' ''</p>
        <p>The project was announced at a news conference the first week of December 2001. ''Did we have anything in place?'' asks Mr. Hatkoff. ''No. We had Martin Scorsese; we had Meryl Streep; we had the governor.'' As he recalls, a potential corporate sponsor asked him: '' 'What is the collateral that is being made available to your sponsors?' I said, 'I don't know what you're talking about.' So he said, 'Do you have any major films?' 'No, not yet.' 'Do you have any venues?' 'No, not yet.' 'Do you know how many people you're expecting?' 'No, not yet.' '' (This year, the festival has 15 sponsors, including The New York Times.)</p>
        <p>City officials -- grateful that anyone was planning entertaining, ambitious events at a time of fear and pessimism -- were less picky. Instead of tying up plans with talk of permits, crowds and noise, they helped push the project through. And the promise of cultural resuscitation was enough to grease some ordinarily slow-moving corporate wheels. American Express, whose offices were located in Battery Park City, next to ground zero, signed on as a founding sponsor before anyone had secured a single film to screen, in part because the company wanted to help finance an event that would make its employees feel better about returning to the devastated neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Still, multi-tentacled projects are hard to get off the ground in New York City. In Los Angeles, the world may revolve around the film industry. But here, star power isn't always enough to cut through red tape, as Mr. De Niro's aborted attempt to convert the Brooklyn Navy Yard into a Hollywood back-lot demonstrated in 1999. So Ms. Rosenthal also relied on the civic connections she had acquired over the years in TriBeCa. ''Jane is just very savvy about what she needs to do,'' said Madelyn Wils, the chairperson of TriBeCa's Community Board 1, a board member of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the newly appointed head of the TriBeCa Film Institute, the film festival's year-round arm.</p>
        <p>The speed of the festival's efforts has resulted in some comic mishaps. Last year a brass band was scheduled to play an outdoor concert -- on a residential street at 5 a.m. And in 2002, Anheuser-Busch, a corporate sponsor, was disappointed when a team of Budweiser Clydesdales got stuck in traffic on the George Washington Bridge and didn't make the opening ceremony. Last year's press materials were unclear about whether the festival actually started on May 1 or May 6; it was all ''part of the charm,'' Mr. Hatkoff said.</p>
        <p>In its first year, organizers said, 150,000 people came to the festival, pumping an additional $10.4 million into the local economy. In 2003, the number of visitors rose to nearly 350,000 and the neighborhood took in $47 million. The success meant happy local politicians and the financial backing to get bigger, faster. Last month, the development corporation voted to grant the festival $3 million over two years to fund its free elements -- the drive-in, street fair and concert which organizers said account for 80 percent of attendance. The TriBeCa Institute has also received a grant of $200,000 from the Empire State Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Over breakfast one recent morning, Ms. Rosenthal explained how a film festival -- or even film production -- could affect city blocks. ''When a movie comes to this intersection right here,'' she said, gesturing toward West 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue, ''this restaurant's business is going to boom. That drug store? Cigarette sales? Everything is just going to boom.'' The neighborhood to which she was gesturing, her home turf, is an area that has undergone the kind of transformation that Ms. Rosenthal is now enacting on her professional stomping ground. On the Upper West Side, institutions like the Thalia theater and Shakespeare and Company have given way to Loews multiplexes and Barnes and Noble. Residents can still find art-house movies and academic press books in the neighborhood, but ''Fifty First Dates'' and ''Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul'' are hawked heavily as well. It's an urban ethos that prizes quantity, choice and inclusiveness over selectivity and specialization.</p>
        <p>To that end, the festival is continuing to grow. ''I hope we really are talking about more of a cultural festival along the lines of Edinburgh, talking about film and theater and the way television has impacted our culture, and comedy and dance and music,'' said Ms. Rosenthal of her plans for the future. The first TriBeCa Theater Festival will take place in October, in conjunction with the TriBeCa-based Drama Dept. theater company. TriBeCa Enterprises, the private partnership of Ms. Rosenthal, Mr. Hatkoff and Mr. De Niro, recently purchased the Screening Room theater and rechristened it TriBeCa Cinemas; it will provide one of the main venues for this year's film festival. The nonprofit TriBeCa Institute will run year-long programs (like TriBeCa All-Access, a contest for first-time minority filmmakers) to bring new talent into the industry. Ms. Wils also hinted at projects she's undertaking with the Board of Education. ''A lot of things will be about bringing the filmmaker closer to the audience,'' she said. That is also the idea behind ''So You Wanna Be in Pictures?,'' a November conference that will allow film enthusiasts to connect with industry professionals. And down at ground zero, the film festival is likely to be one of several arts institutions to share a large performing arts venue, probably one with a proscenium stage that could be used for film premieres, live performances or awards shows.</p>
        <p>But before all that, the film festival will open next weekend. The opening-night movie is ''Raising Helen,'' an adorable-orphan comedy starring Kate Hudson and directed by Garry Marshall. In addition, the festival will feature two of TriBeCa Productions' own films: ''The House of D,'' the actor David Duchovny's writing and directing debut, and ''Stage Beauty,'' a period piece directed by Richard Eyre. Mr. Scarlet insists there was no favoritism at work. ''The holes in the sieve were just as fine for her films as for anything else.''</p>
        <p>For all of the festival's glitzy pageantry, civic impact and expansion plans, there is one arena in which it has yet to make an impact: in the industry that spawned it. Unlike the Sundance Film Festival, which has become a major shopping expedition for Hollywood distributors, the TriBeCa festival has not yet been host to the sale of a single film, or launched a formerly unknown independent title into widespread consciousness. For some observers, that remains an elusive form of validation, a coming-of-age ritual that the festival will have to undergo before it truly arrives.</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Rosenthal doesn't seem to be worrying about it. ''Maybe it happens this year, maybe it happens next year,'' she said, with uncharacteristic nonchalance.</p>
        <p>As long as the festival continues, and continues to grow, it seems, the particular function it serves is of secondary concern to the organizers. Ms. Rosenthal likes to quote Mr. De Niro's pronouncement on the subject: ''I don't know what this will become, but it will become something great.''</p>
