        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re: ''A Question of Ethics: How to Teach Them?'' (Executive Life, March 21), about the business-school debate over teaching ethics as a separate course:</p>
        <p>The article doesn't mention the critical moral example among corporate executives or professors. How believable is a professor who espouses ethical conduct but cancels classes, teaches from outdated notes or treats students as a necessary hindrance to well-paid consulting?</p>
        <p>How do you counsel a young executive who, schooled during the prosperous 90's, never expected to have to fire people or cut costs, and then looks up to see senior management pigging out and demanding excessive compensation, free from performance yardsticks? Just how does a professor honestly encourage corporate loyalty and a willingness to work hard during pay freezes and worse?</p>
        <p>Students need pragmatic war stories, pungent examples of what turning a blind eye to unethical behavior wreaks. And people who live their words.</p>
        <p>Marion K. Pinsdorf  Leonia, N.J., March 28</p>
