        <p>Senator John Kerry said on Tuesday that because of the ballooning federal deficit he would have to scale back some of the domestic proposals he made during the Democratic primary fight, and he accused President Bush of misleading the country on federal spending and the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''If I have to cut back on a program in order to reduce the deficit in half in four years, I will do that,'' Mr. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, told reporters after a rally here. ''I will make the tough choices.''</p>
        <p>On a day of violence in Iraq, he also accused Mr. Bush of sticking to the June 30 deadline for turning over authority of Iraq to an interim government to get the issue out of the way by the November election.</p>
        <p>''I think they wanted to get the troops out and get the transfer out of the way as fast as possible, without regard to the stability of Iraq,'' he said. ''The test ought to be the stability of Iraq, not an arbitrary date.'' He said transfer of power ''should not be related to the election.''</p>
        <p>Campaigning in this swing state, Mr. Kerry sought to present himself as a realist and to draw a contrast with President Bush, whom he portrayed as misleading voters on domestic and foreign policy alike.</p>
        <p>''This administration has a truth deficit,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''Almost every promise they have made to the country, they have broken.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign said it was Mr. Kerry who was misleading voters. Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''Senator Kerry's promises don't add up, so he has to do a bait and switch and cut some of his programs. How much is he raising taxes and where is he cutting spending?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry cited a proposal for early childhood education and a program that would have given free tuition to students attending state colleges in exchange for two years of national service as ones he would scale back.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns have been skirmishing all week over economic issues and plan to do so again on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry is set to deliver an address to discuss how he would create 10 million jobs, as he has promised, and cut the deficit in half in four years.</p>
        <p>Just before that speech, the Bush campaign has scheduled Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, to critique Mr. Kerry's budget proposals.</p>
        <p>Informed by a reporter that the Bush campaign was saying that 44 of Mr. Kerry's proposed programs would cost $1.9 trillion over 10 years in new spending and that he could not pay for them without raising taxes, Mr. Kerry shot back, ''Do you trust the Bush administration's math?'' He supplied his own answer: ''I think it's fuzzy math, as usual, and they're not telling the truth.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign is also running a commercial that accuses Mr. Kerry of wanting to raise taxes by $900 billion, which Mr. Kerry said had no basis in fact.</p>
        <p>He spoke to reporters after addressing an outdoor rally of about 1,800 people in Cincinnati. A handful of Bush supporters crashed the event and waved sets of beach flip-flops in the air, taunting Mr. Kerry for what the Bush campaign has described as Mr. Kerry's own reversals on several issues.</p>
        <p>The senator called them rude and said that like the administration they support the protesters were trying to ignore the real issues.</p>
        <p>President Bush spent a low-key day flying to Arkansas, where he told an audience in El Dorado that he was planning to put some new education programs in place, including one that would provide 20,000 low-income students with up to $5,000 each to study mathematics or science in college.</p>
        <p>The grant program would be financed by a combination of corporate and federal money. There would be no new appropriations for the federal portion. Instead, White House officials said, the money would come from savings in the Pell federal college grant program.</p>
        <p>''It says to a kid, take math and science and you'll get a larger Pell grant,'' Mr. Bush said. He said the savings would come from limiting the Pell grants for four-year college programs to eight years of study and those for two-year community colleges to four. (Aides at the Department of Education said that there were no time limits now for the amount of time students could receive the grants.)</p>
        <p>White House officials said the change in the program would encourage students to finish sooner and eliminate abuse of the program under which students extend their studies indefinitely.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Bush said he would seek to make changes in the federal vocational education program to increase its effectiveness.</p>
        <p>''We're going to make the money we are spending to prepare these youngsters for the 21st century,'' he said. The money to put these programs in place would come from savings, not from spending increases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said he was planning to extend the National Assessment of Education Progress, which now assesses students in the fourth and eighth grades, to the 12th grade. ''I think high schools need to have the bar raised,'' he said. White House aides said the cost would be minimal.</p>

        <p>New Nader Call for Impeachment  CHICAGO, April 6 (AP) -- Ralph Nader called Tuesday for President Bush to be impeached for ''deceiving the American people night after night after night'' about American involvement in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''When you plunge our country into war on a platform of fabrications and deceptions, and you bring back thousands of American soldiers who are sick, injured or dead, and that war is unconstitutionally authorized to begin with, Mr. Bush's behavior qualifies for the high crimes and misdemeanor impeachment clause of the Constitution,'' Mr. Nader told students at Columbia College in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, who is running for president as an independent, said President Bill Clinton was impeached for ''far less of an offense.''</p>
        <p>Merrill Smith, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader previously called for Mr. Bush's impeachment at an antiwar rally on March 20 in the president's hometown, Crawford, Tex.</p>
        <p>The rally was to mark the anniversary of the invasion of Iraq.</p>
