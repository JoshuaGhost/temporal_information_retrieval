        <p>The Bush administration on Thursday approved plans by five states to pool their purchasing power and seek deeper discounts on prescription drugs for more than 900,000 Medicaid recipients.</p>
        <p>The action significantly increases the leverage that states will have in negotiating with drug companies. States have been under intense fiscal pressure in recent years. Medicaid spending and drug costs, in particular, have grown much faster than state revenues.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time in the history of the Medicaid program that states have been able to work together like this to negotiate lower drug costs,'' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
        <p>The Department of Health and Human Services said the five states in the pool -- Alaska, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire and Vermont -- expected to save more than $12 million this year.</p>
        <p>Gov. Craig Benson of New Hampshire, a Republican, said, ''Minnesota, Hawaii and Tennessee intend to join the pool, with more states likely to follow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benson and Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, announced the project in February 2003.</p>
        <p>Michigan officials said negotiations with Washington had been difficult at times. Federal officials apparently wanted to make sure that states would not collude in a way that stifled competition in the pharmaceutical market.</p>
        <p>The five states will use the same company, First Health Services of Glen Allen, Va., to negotiate with manufacturers. Federal officials said each state would maintain its list of preferred drugs, supervised by local doctors and pharmacists.</p>
        <p>Federal officials declined to say whether they wanted to limit the number of states in join the pool.</p>
        <p>''We hope that pharmacy benefit managers will compete,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''We want to make sure there is competition, so states can get a good deal.''</p>
        <p>Michigan is a swing state in the presidential election, but Bush administration officials said politics had played no role in approving the pool.</p>
        <p>Medicaid provides health benefits to 50 million low-income people and is jointly financed by the federal government and the states.</p>
        <p>Governor Granholm said the purchasing pool would benefit ''our most vulnerable citizens.''</p>
        <p>The National Conference of State Legislatures says that at least 10 states are pursuing bulk-purchasing arrangements for Medicaid receipients. Another 10 states are looking at such initiatives for state employees, prison inmates and residents of state mental institutions.</p>
        <p>Drug companies have generally resisted state efforts to expand their purchasing power.</p>
        <p>Wanda Moebius, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobby for makers of brand-name drugs, said, ''Multistate agreements lead to government-selected lists of drugs and a one-size-fits-all approach to medicine.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moebius said the pool created by Michigan and New Hampshire could turn Medicaid into ''the equivalent of a government-run health maintenance organization, making decisions based on cost rather than the needs of individual patients.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Granholm said the pool was different from programs in Canada and other countries where government agencies regulate drug prices.</p>
        <p>''We use a competitive-bidding process that allows manufacturers to work with states and lower their prescription drug prices,'' she said.</p>
