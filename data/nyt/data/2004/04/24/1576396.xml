      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Like so many melancholic television movies, ''Plainsong'' has been bronzed. Out under the Colorado sky, where an actor who resembles George Bush 41 puts up hay, the light looks suntanned; it's the same in the farmhouses lined with hook rugs. Maybe a study has found that this color induces tears, the pleasurable kind with the endorphins and nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The movie, which appears tomorrow night on CBS, is a successful weepie. Adapted by Oliver Goldstick (who has written for ''Everwood'' and now writes and produces for ''American Dreams'') from the popular novel by Kent Haruf, it introduces a slate of characters who confound the usual television-movie formula by being morally ambiguous.</p>

        <p>Like so many melancholic television movies, ''Plainsong'' has been bronzed. Out under the Colorado sky, where an actor who resembles George Bush 41 puts up hay, the light looks suntanned; it's the same in the farmhouses lined with hook rugs. Maybe a study has found that this color induces tears, the pleasurable kind with the endorphins and nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The movie, which appears tomorrow night on CBS, is a successful weepie. Adapted by Oliver Goldstick (who has written for ''Everwood'' and now writes and produces for ''American Dreams'') from the popular novel by Kent Haruf, it introduces a slate of characters who confound the usual television-movie formula by being morally ambiguous.</p>
        <p>Victoria (America Ferrera) sort of wants to have the baby she finds herself pregnant with at 17, but she's only half-enthusiastic. She spends the movie drifting into motherhood, never making much of a case for or against having an abortion. Maggie (Rachel Griffiths), her teacher, only half wants to help her. What she chiefly wants is to get a man.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Tom Guthrie (Aidan Quinn), also a teacher, is sorry his depressed wife is moving out, but not very sorry. The wife, Ella (Megan Follows), does seem burdensome, though she appears to love their two children, Ike (Mick Hazen) and Bobby (Cody Arens). More or less.</p>
        <p>Guthrie's moral restlessness comes through in his contretemps with a student who is failing the history class he teaches. Although the student is indeed exasperating -- and eventually violent -- Guthrie's fury at him, and chop-licking eagerness to give him an F, seems to be determined by more than professional interest.</p>
        <p>This dynamic is richly suggestive; thanks are owed to Mr. Haruf and Mr. Goldstick for calling attention to it. In brief, a male schoolteacher who refuses to bow to administrative pressure to pass bad students is a contemporary hero. But ''Plainsong'' shyly suggests that a man like Guthrie who is vehemently against social promotion may also be a potential tyrant, a stymied has-been at a crisis in his own life, flexing his muscles at the expense of a younger man.</p>
        <p>Marian Seldes, the stage actress, elegantly plays a dying dowager seemingly made of cigarette ash, who unexpectedly hits it off with Guthrie's two sons. And Geoffrey Lewis and William Andrews (he's the Bush-like one), as Raymond and Harold McPheron, similarly adopt Victoria, building a shaky ad hoc family that is among the film's finest resources for tears.</p>
        <p>But after teasing the viewer with its early rigor, the movie doesn't push its characters nearly far enough. Their contradictions vanish at the end of the movie.</p>
        <p>Maggie, who is testy at one point when she thinks she has competition for Guthrie's attention, could have spent more time suffering with jealousy; I would have liked to see that uncute sentiment complicate her independent country ways.</p>
        <p>And Guthrie's romantic clean slate, when he and Maggie come together, is far too clean. Why does a hero need to be burdened by a depressed wife and then to be left by her? We get it; he's innocent. But what if, in a nod to realism, he had left her, and had to grapple with that?</p>
        <p>PLAINSONG  CBS, Sunday at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8 Central time.</p>
        <p>Directed by Richard Pearce; Richard Welsh and Brent Shields, executive producers; written by Oliver Goldstick; based on the novel by Kent Haruf; Orly Adelson, producer; music by Lawrence Shragge. A Hallmark Hall of Fame production.</p>
        <p>WITH: Aidan Quinn (Tom Guthrie), Rachel Griffiths (Maggie), America Ferrera (Victoria Roubideaux), Geoffrey Lewis (Raymond McPheron), William Andrews (Harold McPheron), Megan Follows (Ella), Zachery Bryan (Russell Beckman), Cody Arens (Bobby), Mick Hazen (Ike) and Marian Seldes (Iva Stearns).</p>
