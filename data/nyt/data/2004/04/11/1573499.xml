        <p>Pat Summerall, the sportscaster and former Giants place-kicker, had successful liver transplant surgery yesterday at the Mayo Clinic's St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., a family spokesman, Rick Ericson, said. He was in stable condition in the hospital's intensive care unit. There were no complications during the surgery, the hospital said. Summerall had been on the waiting list for a liver since April 2, and recent tests placed him at the top of the hospital's waiting list. St. Luke's has the country's fourth-largest liver-transplant program and the shortest waiting list.</p>
