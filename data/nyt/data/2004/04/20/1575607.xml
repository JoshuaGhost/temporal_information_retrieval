        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''How I Spent Summer Vacation: Going to Get-Into-College Camp'' (front page, April 18) provides yet another example of how people have capitalized on the anxieties of parents and students during the college admission process.</p>
        <p>Before too many more people become wealthy from the business of college admission, parents should stop and think about what can actually be accomplished during such short (and expensive!) programs.</p>
        <p>Visits to universities for a few hours are not valuable to potential applicants because they do not allow them to attend classes, spend a night in a dorm, eat in the dining hall and chat with current students about their experiences.</p>
        <p>Having taken the SAT's not too long ago, I know of no one who was able to do course work over the span of a few days to improve his scores. And applicants entering their junior years and writing college essays at these camps will certainly have to alter them before submitting them to colleges.</p>
        <p>Parents, be warned: any programs that sound too good to be true, like these camps, are expensive wastes of time. Your children will be better off doing something else that will make them and their applications more interesting to university admission officers.</p>
