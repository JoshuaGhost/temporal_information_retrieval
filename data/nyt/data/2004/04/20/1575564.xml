        <p>With two weeks of classes left in the semester, many Columbia University graduate teaching assistants boycotted classes yesterday and picketed noisily at the university's main gate to try to pressure Columbia into recognizing their right to unionize.</p>
        <p>Some classes were canceled, although neither the university nor the protest organizers could say how many. Some demonstrators said they would not return to class until Columbia acknowledged their right to unionize, while others said they might skip just one class.</p>

        <p>With two weeks of classes left in the semester, many Columbia University graduate teaching assistants boycotted classes yesterday and picketed noisily at the university's main gate to try to pressure Columbia into recognizing their right to unionize.</p>
        <p>Some classes were canceled, although neither the university nor the protest organizers could say how many. Some demonstrators said they would not return to class until Columbia acknowledged their right to unionize, while others said they might skip just one class.</p>
        <p>The disruption on campus seemed limited. Many students sprawled in the bright sunshine on the steps to Low Library, reading or chatting, largely oblivious to the protest.</p>
        <p>Some undergraduates, like Veronica M. Padula, a sophomore majoring in ecology, evolution and environmental biology, expressed sympathy for the graduate assistants, saying they worked hard and were helpful. But many students said the strike was little more than a minor annoyance because Columbia had assured them that they would get grades and, if they were seniors, would graduate.</p>
        <p>''It's fine,'' said Raymond Sultan, a senior whose Italian class was canceled. ''We're all getting more sleep. I don't think people are that sad. It's the end of the year. It's nice out. And we'll teach ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents Columbia's clerical workers and is working with its graduate assistants, said that about 400 people had participated in the morning protest.</p>
        <p>The graduate students voted on unionizing two years ago, but the votes were never counted because Columbia appealed the students' right to unionize to the National Labor Relations Board. The board said last week that it was studying the case, along with similar appeals, including one by the State University of New York.</p>
        <p>Some protesters said that they were happy in their teaching and research jobs, and that the threat of unionization had been instrumental in Columbia's decision to raise its basic stipend to $17,000.</p>
        <p>''When I came in, things weren't bad,'' said Stephen Twilley, a second-year graduate student in Italian. ''But I realized that the stipend had been raised because of efforts to organize, so I have a debt to past organizers. This is our last best hope to move the university.''</p>
        <p>Alan Brinkley, Columbia's provost, said the biggest pressure to improve graduate student compensation was competition with other top universities.</p>
        <p>Not all graduate students support unionization. Jason Governale, a fourth-year graduate student in history, said a union was unnecessary.</p>
        <p>''Ideologically, I am not opposed to the creation of a union, especially when working conditions are poor or hazardous,'' he said. ''But quite frankly, being a teaching assistant at Columbia falls into neither of these categories.''</p>
