        <p>ZEIG--Gaye. Died suddenly, but peacefully, on April 12, 2004. She will always be remembered for her grace, humor, analytic mind and her steadfast vision of a more equitable world. She will be deeply missed by her family, who love her deeply, and the many children and friends who knew her. She is survived by her daughters Susan and Lise, grandchildren Rachel, Nicholas and Emma, sons-in-law David and Gary, and her brother Laurence.</p>
