      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The city has sold a municipal parking garage in downtown Brooklyn, officials of the Economic Development Corporation said yesterday. They called the sale an important element in the city's ambitious plans to rezone the area and encourage more commercial, residential, academic and cultural development. The garage, on Bond Street between Livingston and Schermerhorn Streets, was sold for $6 million to an affiliate of Thor Equities, a national development company that is redeveloping the Gallery at Fulton Street, formerly the Albee Square Mall. The developer plans to keep and possibly add to the 606 parking spaces, upgrade the garage and renovate the ground-floor retail space.</p>
