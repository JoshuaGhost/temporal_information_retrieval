        <p>One of the world's leading antiquities galleries has agreed to return two limestone monuments smuggled out of Egypt in the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The agreement follows the publication of an article in The New York Times that traced the transit of the two pieces, along with a larger companion piece, through the antiquities trade.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the dealer, Phoenix Ancient Art, which operates galleries in Geneva and New York, said he expected that the inscribed, tombstone-shaped slabs, known as steles, would be turned over to Egyptian officials next week.</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, both the lawyer, Mario Roberty, and the Egyptian consul general in New York, Mahmoud Allam, said the article had been instrumental in securing the return of the pieces to Egypt.</p>
        <p>''These objects have become too much talked about,'' Mr. Roberty said.</p>
        <p>The two steles, along with the larger one, were illegally excavated in 1994 at a construction site in Akhmim, about 350 miles south of Cairo. The Times article, which appeared in February, focused on the decade-long journey of the larger stele as it moved from Egypt to Switzerland to Paris and eventually to New York, passing through the hands of smugglers, middlemen and several dealers.</p>
        <p>All three pieces were purchased in 1997 by Phoenix Ancient Art and then sold to another dealer.</p>
        <p>The current owners of Phoenix Ancient Art, Ali and Hicham Aboutaam, had said that their father, Sleiman Aboutaam, bought the three steles and never told them the identity of the seller.</p>
        <p>The brothers said they were unaware that the steles had been looted when the gallery acquired them. Their father died in 1998.</p>
        <p>During the 2002 trial of a New York-based antiquities dealer, Frederick Schultz, evidence showed that the three pieces had been smuggled out of Egypt. Under a 1983 Egyptian law, any antiquity discovered after that date is government property.</p>
        <p>The larger stele, which was seized in New York from the collector who had ended up buying it, was returned to Egypt last year. American officials had contacted the Aboutaams about returning the two companion pieces to Egypt.</p>
        <p>Some time ago the Aboutaams repaid the dealer who had bought the three steles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberty said that in recent weeks they had arranged to have the pieces returned to Egypt through a nonprofit foundation he operates.</p>
        <p>Separately, both Ali and Hicham Aboutaam face continuing legal problems in connection with their involvement with the antiquities trade.</p>
        <p>In December, Hicham Aboutaam was arrested in New York and charged with smuggling an Iranian artifact worth $1 million into the United States. He has not been indicted.</p>
        <p>Ali Aboutaam was recently accused in an Egyptian court of being involved with a ring that smuggled artifacts to Switzerland.</p>
        <p>He has denied any involvement.</p>
