        <p>Directed by Pyotr Lutsik  In Russian, with English subtitles  Not rated, 96 minutes</p>
        <p>A strange, disturbing and yet occasionally quite funny cultural artifact from the new Russia, Pyotr Lutsik's film ''The Outskirts'' (or ''Okraina'') begins as a droll parody of a Soviet-era ''boy-meets-tractor'' movie and develops into a violent vigilante fantasy.</p>
        <p>In the film a group of hearty peasants from the Urals track down the corrupt officials who sold their collective farm to an oil oligarch. When it was released in Russia in 1998, this story line reportedly was so incendiary that there were calls for the film to be banned.</p>
        <p>The peasants are wizened, noble types who might have been sent over by Stalin's own central casting bureau. They work their way up the chain of corruption, from the local collective farm official who foolishly signed a sales contract in exchange for a motorcycle, to the cruel and cynical Moscow businessman who now owns the property. At each step of their journey, which leads them from the wide open steppes to provincial capitals and ultimately to a Stalin-era Moscow office tower, the peasants use tortures, from immersion in a frozen river to threats of decapitation (eventually carried out), to extract the information to lead them to the next miscreant.</p>
        <p>The violence, sometimes quite graphic, seems to belong to a completely different film from the comedy sequences, in which a deadpan satiric style (clearly influenced by Aki Kaurismaki's depressive Finnish comedies) pokes fun at the peasants' taciturnity and how seriously they take themselves. One of them is a spiritual young man with a drawn-out Slavic face who might have stepped out of Dostoyevsky; another is a farmer infused with Tolstoyesque simple dignity; a third is a veteran of the Great Patriotic War (known in the West as World War II) who still regards himself as a fierce, implacable warrior and is responsible for the movie's most sickening torture sequences.</p>
        <p>Shooting in a stark black-and-white format meant to evoke Socialist Realism films of the 1930's, Mr. Lutsik is making a nostalgic appeal to an era that does not seem entirely worthy of such romantic reconsideration.</p>
        <p>But at the same time he has built so much postmodern irony into his film that it's hard to know where satire stops and sincerity begins. Is Mr. Lutsik endorsing his protagonists' brutal tactics or is he making fun of them? Are they admirable role models from Russia's lost past or are they idiot thugs still using the tactics of Stalin's secret police?</p>
        <p>Ultimately these questions are unanswerable, which makes ''The Outskirts,'' opening today in Manhattan, a challenging film and a frustrating one.</p>
