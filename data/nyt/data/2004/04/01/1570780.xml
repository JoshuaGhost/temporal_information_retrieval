        <p>Three days of intense negotiations on proposals by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations to heal the 30-year ethnic division of Cyprus ended without a formal agreement early Thursday, with Greece insisting that no deal was possible.</p>
        <p>But under a complicated timetable agreed to before the negotiations began, Mr. Annan's plan will still be put to two separate referendums among Greek and Turkish Cypriots on April 24. Negotiators here chose not to block the referendums, despite differences over the proposals themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan's plan foresees an array of measures, including reductions in the number of Turkish troops in Cyprus. It would permit some Greek Cypriots to return to homes they fled when Turkey invaded the island in 1974 after a pro-Greek coup. And Cyprus would become a loose federation of two equal political parts before it joins the European Union on May 1.</p>
        <p>But while Turkey seemed enthusiastic after the negotiations, Greece was not.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately it proved impossible to reach an agreed solution,'' the Greek prime minister, Costas Caramanlis, said in a statement, refusing to answer questions from journalists about the reasons for disagreement. ''It is now up to the people of Cyprus and its political leadership to make the final decision.''</p>
        <p>The decision to proceed to popular ballots among Greek and Turkish Cypriots averted a total breakdown in Mr. Annan's efforts to reunite the island. But the Greek leader's remarks only underscored the divergent perceptions of the island's destiny among Greece and Turkey and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations.</p>
        <p>Only moments before Mr. Caramanlis spoke, the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, gave a far more upbeat assessment that seemed to endorse the same proposals that the Greek leader rejected.</p>
        <p>''The new road map for Cyprus has been drawn in Bürgenstock,'' he said, referring to the hilltop complex of luxury hotels near this Swiss village where the closed-door negotiations took place. ''I would like to send a message to the Greek nation and the Greek Cypriots: let us walk together on the path of peace that started here.''</p>
        <p>Under a prearranged schedule, the talks produced what Mr. Annan called a final plan for the reunification of Cyprus before it joins the European Union on May 1, a deadline that added urgency to the current negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I hope for a reunited Cyprus to accede to the European Union on May 1,'' Mr. Annan said, speaking in at a hotel in Bürgenstock where the participants from Greece, Turkey, both sides of the divided island and the United Nations sat at tables arranged in a pentagonal order so that no one side would dominate another.</p>
        <p>But he warned the participants that they faced hard choices.</p>
        <p>''The time for negotiation and consultation is over,'' Mr. Annan said in a somber address to the negotiators at a closing ceremony just before midnight on Wednesday. ''The time for decision and action has arrived.''</p>
        <p>''The people of Cyprus will look to you, their leaders, for guidance'' in the referendums on April 24, he said.</p>
        <p>But while the island's leaders have become used to decades of negotiations to find a settlement, Mr. Annan seemed to suggest that failure this time would be permanent.</p>
        <p>''The choice is not between this settlement plan and some other magical or mythical solution,'' he said. ''The choice is between this settlement or no settlement.''</p>
        <p>If voters on either side's referendum reject the proposals to reunify the island then Cyprus will enter the European Union as an anomaly, with its northern part severed from the rest and still occupied by 40,000 Turkish troops. Only the much wealthier Greek Cypriot south will be represented within the European Union.</p>
        <p>Reflecting Turkey's desire to ensure that the Cyprus dispute does not thwart its own ambitions to join the European Union, Mr. Erdogan suggested that his government would campaign for a ''yes'' vote among Turkish Cypriots, who are seen as more favorable to reunifying the island than Greek Cypriots are.</p>
        <p>''We started this path with good will and of course we would like to achieve a result,'' Mr. Erdogan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan defended his plan as a fair compromise between the competing concerns of the island's Greek Cypriot majority and its Turkish Cypriot minority, saying it offered ''better safeguards'' for all 800,000 Cypriots.</p>
        <p>He said his proposals would enable ''a substantial number of Greek Cypriots'' to return to areas they fled in 1974, while some Turkish Cypriots would be required to abandon homes to make way for them. He also said the plan would lead to troop reductions and give both sides a chance to run their own affairs.</p>
