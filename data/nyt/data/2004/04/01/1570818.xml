        <p>The abrupt and indefinite postponement of the Arab League summit meeting that was to have been held in Tunis last weekend was a more eloquent statement about Arab politics than any proclamation that might have come from the gathering. The rulers-for-life who gather at these extravaganzas usually produce grand declarations that are quickly forgotten, or buried under the rubble of the Middle East. Two years ago, the Beirut declaration, based on the Saudi peace initiative, was killed, in part, by a suicide bombing in Israel aimed at torpedoing any hope of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian standoff. This time, under pressure from the Bush administration and from domestic dissidents to get serious about democracy, the Arab potentates were unable to agree even on a way to mark time.</p>
        <p>There were other explanations for the collapse of the meeting. The American-led occupation of Iraq has generated powerful anti-American sentiments throughout the Arab world, and Arab leaders are wary of appearing to fall in line behind President Bush at this time. Israel's recent assassination of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, also fired up strong passions. It is unfortunate that the Bush administration's arrogant foreign policies have alienated so many potential allies, and tragic that the Arab-Israeli conflict continues to feed hatreds across the region. But while Mr. Bush is wrong to believe that he can impose democracy by force, he is right to demand that the Middle East begin cleaning its house.</p>

        <p>The Arab world's need to defy Washington and revile Israel is not a valid excuse to perpetuate medieval autocracies and repressive dictatorships. The claim that the Middle East is somehow immune to democracy, whether through tradition, history or religion, is equally spurious. Striking evidence of this was provided by a gathering of Arab intellectuals and nongovernmental organizations at the Alexandria Library in Egypt in mid-March. The statement they issued is a ringing proclamation of universal democratic values and the urgent need to spread them through the Arab world. The statement rejects talk of special conditions or needs and does not mention the occupation of Iraq or Palestine. It is a call on the Arabs to adopt democracy -- not because the West wants them to, but because it's best for them. What gives the statement real force is that it is not a prescription from Washington or Jerusalem, but from within, which makes it a perfect counterpoint to the silence from Tunis.</p>
        <p>President Bush and other leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized countries will soon gather for their own annual extravaganza -- and the Middle East will be a central subject there. They should offer unambiguous support for those Arabs who seek to live in freedom. Leafing through the Alexandria Statement is good preparation.</p>
