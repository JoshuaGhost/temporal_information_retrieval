        <p>WHAT kind of a person bypasses drugstore aisles chock full of inexpensive folding camp chairs to go online and obsessively research such traits as ''resin feet'' and ''chair back imprint areas?''</p>
        <p>A person who understands the important role that certain features play in reclining, that's who.</p>
        <p>I had my first full-featured lawn chair on Long Island, and it was a beauty: a low-slung, webbed foldable number with a cup holder and a slot on the other armrest that was the perfect size for holding a deck of cards. I suspect it was originally intended for a pack of cigarettes, but I was more interested in five-card stud.</p>
        <p>For many summers, I hauled the chair out to the front lawn to establish a base camp at eye level with the peonies. Camouflaged partly by the garden, I had it all: I could enjoy a discreet gin and tonic while yelling at the children to watch out for that car and, when applicable, raise my husband three on two pair.</p>
        <p>But my lawn chair needs changed drastically after I moved to California. Even if the rivets on my old aluminum throne hadn't rusted disastrously, I would have had to explore other options.</p>
        <p>These days I do most of my reclining on the sidelines of my daughters' softball games. But I also need a versatile chair, a chair that will be as comfortable on the beach as at the ballfield. It should collapse into a small, manageable package that can be stored in the back of the station wagon.</p>
        <p>Last week, I investigated a lot of camp chairs for sale online. Avid Outdoors (avidoutdoors.com) had a Coleman Pack Away Chair ($36) with backpacker straps for easy portability. Kmart.com had a MacCabee Bazaar Captain Chair for ($9.97) with a powder-coated steel frame. L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com) had a Penobscot Adjustable Chair ($69) with a frame of kiln-dried hardwood. How to choose?</p>
        <p>Chairs specialize. Of all types of furniture -- even taking into consideration the many permutations of the bed (water, futon) and the sofa (loveseat, sectional) -- the chair has the most flexibility to meet specific needs. There's the rocking chair, for instance. The easy chair. The Adirondack chair. The dining chair. The electric chair. The first outdoor chair may have been the Windsor rocking chair, used on southern England's lawns as early as 1740, according to www.designboom.com, an online magazine for the international design community.</p>
        <p>Clearly, a camp chair must live up to lofty traditions. So I made a list of essential features: durable enough to withstand being left outside in the rain, easy to unfold in about 10 seconds, drink holder big enough to accommodate a large latte (succumbing to Left Coast peer pressure, I sometimes take mine with soy milk). I also had my husband's advice ringing in my ears. ''Don't forget about poker,'' he said, desperate to win back a certain stack of red chips that he has deluded himself into thinking he has a chance to regain.</p>
        <p>My first serious flirtation with a chair was at www.campingworld.com (''Your RV and Camping Supercenter Since 1966''), where I saw a folding camp chair for $8.02, which sounded like such a bargain that I could afford to accessorize it with a Snack Daddy beverage and snack tray (''easily mounts'') for an additional $7.19. But when I read the fine print, I learned that the chair's capacity (225 pounds) was less than those of many other models I had seen while browsing. I pictured myself on the chair. I saw myself in a typical situation, sitting under a mound of 6-year-olds as my daughter, her best friend and my dog all tried to pile on my lap at once. I decided to pass it up.</p>
        <p>At growinglifestyle.com, the high-end ''3-in-1 Portable Backpack Chair'' ($37.99) was tempting for its array of specialty features. The chair came with a cover that had a pouch big enough to store clothing, as well as a pouch with an insulated cooler to keep up to six soda cans ''ice cold.'' But the site's return policy turned me off: ''Generally, the minimum charges imposed on all returned items would be shipping charges plus up to 25 percent of the order total (the 25 percent covers restocking and credit card fees imposed by our bank to us for the transactions).'' No thanks.</p>
        <p>Then I found geartrends.com, a review site for outdoor and health products. There, I read a rave for a company called Travel Chair: ''Rest assured that in addition to getting a fashionable product at a competitive price, you'll also be getting a comfortable, top-quality chair that will service you for many years to come.''</p>
        <p>No mention of poker, but otherwise promising.</p>
        <p>I phoned the site's co-editor, Michael Hodgson, to get more information.</p>
        <p>''Have you actually sat in one of these chairs?'' I asked him.</p>
        <p>''Everything that we review we first test very hard,'' he said. ''It has a nice feel, nice suspension, and it's the chair I will sit in with a mai tai in one hand and a book in the other and just while away the hours.''</p>
        <p>That was enough to send me straight to the company's site at travelchair.com, where I learned that Travel Chair pioneered the collapsible camp chair design 20 years ago. Now the company has expanded to include several specialized lines of chairs: the Core Line (including the Lounge Lizard model and the Bubba Chair), the Slacker Series (collapsible stools) and Minimalists (sit-on-the-ground or stadium chairs without legs).</p>
        <p>The chairs featured a level of specialization that indicated these people knew seating: saltwater-resistant finishes, oversize steel rivets, double-layered polyester fabric, seatbelt webbing to connect the upright stays to the seat.</p>
        <p>I was intrigued most, however, by the Lingerie Line. I phoned.</p>
        <p>''For me, would you recommend the French Cut, the Teddy or the Fishnet?'' I asked Marty Grabijas, Travel Chair's vice president for sales and marketing.</p>
        <p>''With the Lingerie line, you're getting a chair that won't puddle water when it rains and will dry extremely quickly,'' Mr. Grabijas said. ''The downside is the fabric does tend to breathe and be kind of cool, so in an Alpine setting where it's 35 degrees at night, sitting at the fireside, your backside is going to feel a heinous draft.''</p>
        <p>Since the company's site does not sell directly to consumers, my last question was where I could buy a Travel Chair online.</p>
        <p>''The two largest online sellers are zearth.com and sitincomfort.com, and REI has some of the line too,'' Mr. Grabijas said. ''The pricing should be pretty much within a buck or two of one another.''</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I compared prices on the French Cut (the lightest and most compact of the Lingerie Line). Neither sitincomfort.com nor rei.com had that particular model (although rei.com did have Travel Chair's ''ultralight'' beach two-seater for $55, among others). Zearth had new and like-new models of the French Cut on sale, at $34.99 and $29.70, shipping included.</p>
        <p>A customer service representative at Zearth told me that Bargain Center items are returned merchandise in original packaging, so I ordered two.</p>
        <p>The mesh pocket in the armrest will comfortably hold a deck of cards.</p>
