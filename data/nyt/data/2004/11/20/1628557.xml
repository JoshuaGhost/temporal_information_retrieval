        <p>Re ''Unions Resume Debate Over Merging and Power'' (news article, Nov. 18):</p>
        <p>As union leaders debate whether there should be more union mergers and whether small unions are less effective and must become part of larger ones to succeed, they seem to be forgetting one important fact. Unions are membership organizations and, it is assumed, democratically run, so decisions about structural changes must be made by the members.</p>
        <p>For each successfully negotiated union merger, there are at least two that failed because members rejected them when they thought more would be lost than gained.</p>
        <p>Union leaders have to expand the merger debate and include the membership, or it will remain just that -- a debate.</p>
