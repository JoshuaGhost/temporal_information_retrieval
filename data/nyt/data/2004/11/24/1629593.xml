        <p>You need much more than excellent technique to perform George Crumb's ''Makrokosmos,'' 24 fantasy pieces for amplified piano in two volumes, written in 1972-73.

        <p>These fantasy-pieces with their evocative titles (like ''The Phantom Gondolier'' and ''Ghost-Nocturne for the Druids of Stonehenge'') are complex works that broke new ground in the exploration of piano sonorities.

        <p>You need much more than excellent technique to perform George Crumb's ''Makrokosmos,'' 24 fantasy pieces for amplified piano in two volumes, written in 1972-73. As the pianist Margaret Leng Tan demonstrated on Saturday night at Zankel Hall, you must also be a physically flexible and focused actor.</p>
        <p>These fantasy-pieces with their evocative titles (like ''The Phantom Gondolier'' and ''Ghost-Nocturne for the Druids of Stonehenge'') are complex works that broke new ground in the exploration of piano sonorities. But producing the unearthly and exotic sounds involves much more than simply playing the piano.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tan spent much time leaning into the piano to pluck and scrape the strings, sometime with thimbles on her fingers, sometimes with a percussionist's wire brush. In one work she used a glass tumbler to glide up and down the depressed strings to produce distant banshee cries or whistles, all of which were subjected to discreet amplification that prolonged and bent the tones. When some plucked string effect came off just right, Ms. Tan would thrust her hands into the air, her fingers spread, like a sorceress pleased with some new spice she had added to a gurgling brew. And in several pieces, while playing and scraping, Ms. Tan also had to sing and shout.</p>
        <p>But most of ''Makrokosmos'' involves playing the piano in the traditional way, on the keyboard and with the fingers, which Ms. Tan did impressively, revealing a rich variety of touch and shadings as well as formidable technique during the music's brilliant passages. On the surface many of these pieces can seem merely like timeless, amorphous essays in sound. The best ones are those in which the content of the music -- the astringent harmonies, the skittish atonal flights, the crisscrossing contrapuntal lines -- engage the brain as well as the ear. The few times Mr. Crumb quotes passages of familiar music, like the famous tune from Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu, an element of sentimental nostalgia intrudes. Still, it was impossible not to respond to Ms. Tan's intense involvement with this visionary music.</p>
