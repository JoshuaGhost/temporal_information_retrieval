        <p>City Council leaders pushed through legislation yesterday that establishes tough new penalties for those who sell or use unlicensed motorized scooters, saying that the current ban on the scooters does not go far enough to stem a growing problem.</p>
        <p>The Council voted unanimously in support of the legislation, easily overriding a veto last month by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The mayor and other city officials say that the law is unnecessary and would have little practical effect, because state law already prohibits the operation of scooters on public streets and sidewalks. A city law also requires stores selling the scooters to post signs about the ban.</p>
        <p>''Motorized scooters traveling at any speed can be dangerous for operators and pedestrians alike, particularly in New York City,'' the mayor said in his veto message. ''Existing laws are, however, sufficient to address the goals of this legislation.''</p>
        <p>But Council Speaker Gifford Miller and his colleagues say that current laws have failed to prevent the spread of these scooters, which are also known as pocket rockets and mini-motorcycles. The scooters, which can reach 40 miles per hour or more, have become especially popular with teenagers.</p>
        <p>''This is a significant problem,'' Mr. Miller said yesterday at a news conference before the vote. ''People are being injured in New York's streets, and there's been more and more of them -- as all of us know -- over the years.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Police Department said that while tickets are currently issued to people who ride the motorized scooters on city streets and sidewalks, the department does not track that specific number. The tickets are issued as moving violations, a category that includes cars as well as scooters.</p>
        <p>The new law, which is expected to take effect in 120 days, bans the operation, sale or rental of motorized scooters anywhere in the city, including on private property. It sets a fine of $500 for those caught riding the scooters and allows police officers to impound the vehicles. It also imposes a $1,000 fine for those caught selling, renting or leasing them, with the fine rising to $2,000 for each subsequent violation within one year.</p>
        <p>The law does not apply to motorized wheelchairs and devices to help the disabled, or to electric-powered scooters with a maximum speed of 15 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Councilman Michael E. McMahon, of Staten Island, said that he sponsored the legislation after residents in his district reported increasing run-ins with what he called ''this swarm of locusts,'' or packs of teenagers riding scooters on neighborhood lawns and in school yards. In July, a teenager was killed after his motorized scooter crashed in Queens.</p>
        <p>It was the 19th time that the Council had overridden a mayoral veto of legislation since Mayor Bloomberg took office in 2002. In recent months, Mr. Miller and other Council members have increasingly assailed the mayor for vetoing their proposals.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Council leaders also stepped up their criticism of the continued delays in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's planned takeover of the seven private bus lines serving Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. Still, Council leaders agreed to extend the operating authority for the private bus lines from Dec. 4, when it currently expires, until as long as April 30.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bloomberg also issued a statement yesterday saying that the M.T.A. would purchase 300 new express and local buses to improve transportation in areas served by the private bus lines with $132 million in federal money. The purchase would be in addition to the 125 new buses purchased by the M.T.A. last week for those areas, the mayor's aides said.</p>
