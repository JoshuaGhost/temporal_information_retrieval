        <p>Monday was a close night for the big three networks in total viewers. Though the rivalry between the Jets and the Dolphins has provided dramatic installments of ''Monday Night Football'' over the years, the 41-14 Jets victory, left, was not one of them. Despite the blowout, ABC edged out a victory in the ratings game for the night, with 13.67 million viewers tuning in to watch football, according to Nielsen's overnight numbers. The CBS lineup came in second over all, though it featured an evening of repeats. A repeat of the season premiere of ''CSI: Miami'' was the night's most-watched show, attracting an audience of 14.41 million at 10 p.m. But during that hour, NBC's special, ''Saturday Night Live Presidential Bash 2004: The Great Debates,'' was No. 1 with the 18-to-49 set, bringing in 13.06 million viewers. NBC was also strong earlier in the night with ''Fear Factor'': A total of 12.15 million people watched the gross-out competition.</p>
