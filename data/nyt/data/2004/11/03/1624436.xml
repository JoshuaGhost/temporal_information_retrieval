        <p>HENDLER--Hyman B., M.D. 95, passed peacefully on November 1. Hy Hendler lived by these words excerpted from his favorite poem: ''When you get what you want in your struggle for self And the world makes you king for a day, Just go to a mirror and look at yourself And see what that man has to say.'' A general surgeon for fifty years, practicing on the South Shore of Long Island, Dr. Hendler started a surgical group in Amityville as well as Hempstead, helped found Freeport and Brunswick General Hospitals and skillfully attended to countless patients. His arduous path to becoming a physician cultivated a profound empathy for patients and his family. Orphaned at 15, he graduated from Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland Medical School despite many hardships. A determined self made man, he applied himself wholeheartedly to all aspects of life. His accomplishments and reputation as a physician were equally matched by his business acumen. Throughout his life many sought his council and few were disappointed by his honest, compassionate and forthright advice. Never one to boast about his own hard earned success, he was a modest man who loved making others laugh. He golfed and played gin as a member of Cold Spring Country Club, and Broken Sound. Hy put his family above all else and we are forever grateful for his profound contemplative generosity. He will be missed and fondly remembered by Ethel, his loving wife of sixty four years. His sons Fred and and Donald, daughters-in-law Nancy and Adrienne, five grandchildren, Ian and wife Debra, Noah and wife Nancy, Sarah, Kimberly and Clinton and three great grandchildren Natasha, Isaac and Julian will all carry on his legacy. Services will be held Friday, November 5th at Gutterman Warheit Memorial Chapel in Boca Raton, Florida at 3pm. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Boca Raton Hospital in honor of his caring physician Dr. Evan Goldstein.</p>
