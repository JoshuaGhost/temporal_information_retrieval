        <p>Re ''A Panicked Child, a Worried Parent, a Controversial Pill'' (Nov. 16): As a psychologist, I was pleased to see a column on anxiety disorders in children, and how parents can best respond.</p>
        <p>While I am glad the child was treated promptly, I was surprised a psychotherapist would say ''candidly'' that an 8-year-old is too young for treatment. Many children are successfully treated with cognitive and behavioral therapies and can be easily motivated to participate using simple reinforcements.</p>
        <p>Using talk therapy to promote insight or offer reassurance is far less effective than providing tools to anxiety sufferers of all ages for successfully managing symptoms. And psychiatric medications are probably best prescribed by specialists, not by pediatricians.</p>
