        <p>A retired police detective has been indicted in the accidental shooting of a deli worker in Astoria on Oct. 18, a person with detailed knowledge of the case said yesterday. District Attorney Richard A. Brown will hold a news conference this morning to announce developments in the investigation, said a spokesman, declining to elaborate. The former detective, John R. Malik, 60, of Astoria, was waiting for Manuel Chametla, 18, a worker at the Astoria Food Mart, to cash lottery tickets when his pistol discharged about 11 p.m. and a bullet struck and killed Mr. Chametla, officials have said. Mr. Malik told the police that his beeper had gone off, and that in reaching for it, he fumbled his gun, causing it to fire, officials said. News of the indictment was first reported yesterday in The New York Post. Mr. Malik's lawyer, John M. Murphy Jr., declined to comment, as did Mr. Malik, reached by telephone last night.</p>
