        <p>There are grand things happening at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, that beautiful though still unfinished Gothic structure on 110th and Amsterdam Avenue in Morningside Heights.</p>
        <p>This progressive church has long pledged to be ''a unifying center for intellectual light and leadership.''</p>
        <p>Right now it is a center for first-rate international art too. The Dimpho Di Kopane lyric theater company of South Africa is there through Nov. 28, performing beautifully thought out and deeply felt versions of classic Western texts. ''Yiimimangaliso: The Mysteries'' is based on a medieval cycle of English plays that made Bible stories into street theater; ''U-Carmen'' pares Bizet's opera down to its musical and dramatic essentials; ''Ikumankanikazi ye Khephu'' is an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's ''Snow Queen''; and ''Ibali Loo Tsotsi'' is a different look at ''The Beggar's Opera,'' the 1728 John Gay hit, which Brecht and Weill would turn into that 1928 hit ''The Threepenny Opera.''</p>
        <p>Dimpho Di Kopane , or D.D.K. (its name means ''combined talents'' in Sotho), was founded four years ago when a South African businessman persuaded the two Englishmen who ran the Broomhill Opera Company in London to form a black musical theater company in South Africa. This millennium venture took hold in a new way. Mark Dornford-May (artistic director) and Charles Hazelwood (music director) soon realized that holding auditions in the usual way -- bringing a résumé and photo, two songs and sheet music to a theater or cultural center -- was not going to work. So they contacted townships and choirs around South Africa and traveled to them.</p>
        <p>They listened to people (most of whom had sung in choirs since they were children) audition with arias, hymns, traditional tribal songs and American pop songs, and ultimately assembled a repertory company of vibrantly skilled actor-singer-dancers. After great international success, they have finally arrived in New York as part of ''Season South Africa,'' a festival of contemporary visual and performing arts held at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine and the Museum for African Art in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>Apart from the sheer theatrical and musical pleasure these productions bring, they have taken a huge leap past the usual conventions about how Western and non-Western styles should meet, especially when the styles are Anglo- and African-based.</p>
        <p>We are all too familiar with the old pattern by which some classic work is injected with the style serum of a culture assumed to be earthier, more sensual and less intellectual and therefore able to reach the audience with its primal force, or at the very least its openhearted warmth and vibrant energy.</p>
        <p>How dreary those contrasts are! It's not that Dorothy Dandridge and Harry Belafonte weren't riveting in the all-black film version of ''Carmen Jones,'' which relocated Bizet's opera to South Carolina. But the black vernacular of Oscar Hammerstein, Jr. was too self-conscious, and it didn't always suit the music. When the four-square gospel-voice of Pearl Bailey met the triple meter of ''The Gypsy Song'' and turned it into ''Beat Out 'Dat Rhythm on a Drum,'' two worlds collided most unhappily.</p>
        <p>Nothing could be farther from the path taken by the D.D.K. directors, actors and choreographer. Two sets of performance traditions meet. They alter and enhance each other.</p>
        <p>So far I've seen ''U-Carmen'' (performed in English) and ''The Mysteries'' (in English, Xhosa, Afrikaans and Zulu). ''Carmen'' is a wonderful opera, but it is an old chestnut, too, and I felt the weight of duty. The last experimental version I saw was on film: Peter Brook's 85-minute, four-character tragedy in 1983. The emotional compression worked, but one felt the director's strong arm at every moment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dornford-May and Mr. Hazelwood have pared their ''Carmen'' down to about two hours. ''Bizet was a marvelous composer, but he did overwrite in parts,'' Mr. Hazelwood said by telephone. ''We've tried to concentrate on the essentials.''</p>
        <p>They have succeeded. The orchestra is, of course, smaller too, but they have kept the amplitude.</p>
        <p>We need to see and feel the world of restless Carmen and her factory life. Here, when the workday ends, the women emerge from a trapdoor beneath the stage. Their shapeless pink uniforms are gone; they laugh and lounge about; they're dressed to party and flirt. Then Carmen (Pauline Malefane) makes her entrance slowly. She is full-bodied and gorgeous in her black pants, cherry-red bustier and blouse and bare feet. She is playful too; conquest is the best game around. When she places a mug on top of her head and dances, it's a challenge -- both to the courteous, refined soldier Don José (can you be daring, but keep your balance as I do?) and to the other women (can you turn any common object into an instrument of seduction?).</p>
        <p>From stars to chorus, the singing is gorgeous. The voices have such texture and richness. And they never take the music for granted. This ''Carmen'' is not a period piece cunningly adapted to a new world. It is a drama that lives and breathes in a borderland between France, Spain and South Africa.</p>
        <p>One of the things that most intrigued me was the easy blend of black dance -- the fluid hips and shoulders, the shimmies and bent legs -- the stamps, claps and swaying -- with Bizet's flamenco-touch music. What made it organic instead of a gimmick? The choreographer, Joel Mthethwa, used subtlety. He wasn't out to titillate us. He knew just how two traditions of sensuous and percussive movement can work together.</p>
        <p>In both these plays, choreography and directing flow into each other. This is perfect for the pageantry of ''The Mystery Plays.'' (The first act uses stories from the Old Testament; the second draws on the new.) These are myths; they need a sense of ritual. But they are vernacular, too. No form of street theater, from mystery play to commedia dell'arte to Mardi Gras parade, can work without broad theatrics. Not crude, but broad -- and resourceful. The Flood: A watering can is poured into a white bowl. The stable in which Mary and Joseph rest? A bale of hay is set down center-stage. The angels wear derbies with white feathers and the devil wears red leather.</p>
        <p>The acting is pure, clear and gestural. Adam and Eve (in white) slowly touch their own limbs in wonderment; a bare-chested God extends his arms and gazes out serenely; the disciples -- township fellows in bell-bottoms and caps -- execute competing high-legged dance moves.</p>
        <p>Gods and humans speak to each other in English, Afrikaans, Xhosa and Zulu: language is multimedia. There are drums, but much of the singing is a cappella, too. The harmonies are glorious. And the score moves between grandeur and humor. The flood ends and as the people leave the ark, they burst into a calypso version of ''You Are My Sunshine.''</p>
        <p>''The Snow Queen'' and ''The Beggars' Opera'' are in repertory, too. Don't miss any of them.</p>
