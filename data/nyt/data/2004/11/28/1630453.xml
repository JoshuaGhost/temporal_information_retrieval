        <p>''THIS is definitely a 'Spinal Tap' moment,'' complained Lee Worrall, the bassist of the Scottish band Dogs Die in Hot Cars, as the bandmates, hungry and tired on the last leg of their first American tour, wandered down the Delaware River waterfront in search of something to eat.</p>
        <p>''Stop; we're having fun,'' shouted the lead singer, Craig Macintosh, in mock enthusiasm, pointing a minicamcorder at his bandmates: the keyboardist Ruth Quigley, the guitarist Gary Smith and the drummer Laurence Davey. They grinned obligingly.</p>

        <p>The Scottish band Dogs Die in Hot Cars, hungry and tired on the last leg of their first American tour, wandered down the Delaware River waterfront looking for food recently.</p>

        <p>''THIS is definitely a 'Spinal Tap' moment,'' complained Lee Worrall, the bassist of the Scottish band Dogs Die in Hot Cars, as the bandmates, hungry and tired on the last leg of their first American tour, wandered down the Delaware River waterfront in search of something to eat.</p>
        <p>''Stop; we're having fun,'' shouted the lead singer, Craig Macintosh, in mock enthusiasm, pointing a minicamcorder at his bandmates: the keyboardist Ruth Quigley, the guitarist Gary Smith and the drummer Laurence Davey. They grinned obligingly.</p>
        <p>Dogs Die in Hot Cars has little in common with the washed-up rockers of that 1984 mockumentary. Despite deriding ''perhaps the worst band name in rock history,'' Blender magazine called the Dogs Die album, ''Please Describe Yourself,'' ''a debut of wit, invention and bracing oddness.'' The band's sound has been likened to XTC and Dexy's Midnight Runners.</p>
        <p>The group has existed in various permutations since the men in it were 13; they are now 25. Ms. Quigley, who is 23, joined the band after meeting Mr. Smith at a musical conservatory. At dinner at a Japanese restaurant, the five interacted seamlessly, occasionally chirping inexplicable private jokes at one another, like dolphins.</p>
        <p>The talk around the table veered from music to movies to the house in Glasgow the band shared for three years. (''I don't miss your dirty socks and pants everywhere, mate,'' Mr. Worrall told Mr. Davey.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Macintosh asked, ''Did you know Sylvester Stallone actually wrote the 'Rocky' pictures?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Worrall exclaimed: '' 'Rocky' is brilliant, just brilliant. When he runs up the stairs, I was like, 'C'mon Rocky, c'mon!' I really felt for him.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly Mr. Smith asked, ''Remember that time I caught a fly with chopsticks? I was just playing around with them, like this.'' He snapped the chopsticks in the air. ''And I caught one, just by accident.''</p>
        <p>He was greeted with stares of disbelief and backtracked slightly. ''Or maybe I didn't?'' he said. ''Maybe I made that up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Macintosh interrupted. ''I had a chemistry teacher that said he threw a pen across the room and he swore that it landed right side up, like this.'' He balanced the chopstick upright on the table. ''I don't know if he was telling the truth or not. What are the chances of that happening? I mean, it has to happen once in the universe, right?''</p>
        <p>After dinner, as they turned out of the parking lot, a low humming began in the back seat: the theme song to ''Rocky.'' It grew louder until Ms. Quigley craned her neck to ask, ''What's going on?''</p>
        <p>The answer came in unison: ''We're going to run up the Rocky steps!''</p>
        <p>They had only 20 minutes before they were due onstage, and it was raining, but the tour manager pulled over at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, so the band could dash up the steps, the same ones Rocky climbed in the 1976 film.</p>
        <p>At the top of the steps, with the lighted facade of the museum in the background, the Dogs huffed and surveyed the city, just as Rocky had done before winning the heavyweight championship.</p>
