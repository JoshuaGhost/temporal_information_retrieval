        <p>On Wednesday, the police said, Mr. Lafayette picked up an 18-year-old woman at Flatbush and Church Avenues and drove a short distance before he pulled his vehicle over and raped her.</p>
        <p>The police said that Mr. Lafayette was operating a van without a license from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission.</p>
        <p>So-called gypsy cabs are popular in the city because they often run along the same routes as city buses and typically charge a $1 fare.</p>
