        <p>Two weeks after Wendy's International said that it would end a campaign featuring a character named Mr. Wendy, the company begins a monthlong campaign featuring the original Mr. Wendy's -- its founder, Dave Thomas, who died in 2002.</p>
        <p>The campaign's newspaper and television ads feature photographs of Mr. Thomas and express sentiments like ''We're still doing it Dave's way'' and ''It's the way Dave would have done it.'' Wendy's ran some ads and posted signs in its stores honoring Mr. Thomas after his death.</p>

        <p>Two weeks after Wendy's International said that it would end a campaign featuring a character named Mr. Wendy, the company begins a monthlong campaign featuring the original Mr. Wendy's -- its founder, Dave Thomas, who died in 2002.</p>
        <p>The campaign's newspaper and television ads feature photographs of Mr. Thomas and express sentiments like ''We're still doing it Dave's way'' and ''It's the way Dave would have done it.'' Wendy's ran some ads and posted signs in its stores honoring Mr. Thomas after his death.</p>
        <p>Don Calhoon, executive vice president for marketing at Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio, said the new campaign was part of a promotion surrounding the chain's 35th anniversary and its annual Founder's Week, which marks the opening of the first Wendy's in Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 15, 1969. The company created Founder's Week to emphasize its history after Mr. Thomas died.</p>
        <p>The Thomas campaign, planned to run through Dec. 22, is not the replacement for the Mr. Wendy campaign, which began in February and was cut short amid complaints by franchisees and analysts that it failed to sufficiently promote Wendy's menu items and that it contributed to recent softness in sales at Wendy's restaurants. The campaigns were created by McCann Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group, which is developing a campaign to replace the Mr. Wendy ads.</p>
