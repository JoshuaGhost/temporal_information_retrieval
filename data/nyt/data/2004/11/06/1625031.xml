        <p>MBNA said yesterday that it had introduced a line of credit cards under the American Express brand. In January, MBNA became the first big Visa and MasterCard bank in the United States to agree to issue cards on the American Express network. Last month, it received a green light to do so when the Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal by Visa and MasterCard to a court decision that gave banks permission to work with other networks. MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del., said that the first offers were mailed to members of 1,000 of the affinity groups for which MBNA issues cards. More than 300,000 people signed up for the cards in advance, MBNA said.</p>
