        <p>But it is highly unlikely that any new, more collective leadership, even if it lasts, will have the ability or the authority to make important decisions about issues of war and peace for a long time to come, let alone take an openly aggressive role against Palestinian militants and terrorists.</p>

        <p>With Yasir Arafat apparently near death, leading Palestinian politicians have moved rapidly to prevent a visible vacuum of power, reaching out to disaffected younger legislators, Palestinian militant organizations and, quietly, the Israelis.</p>
        <p>But it is highly unlikely that any new, more collective leadership, even if it lasts, will have the ability or the authority to make important decisions about issues of war and peace for a long time to come, let alone take an openly aggressive role against Palestinian militants and terrorists.</p>
        <p>''There will be a sharpening of long knives, with groupings around personalities, not platforms,'' predicted Zakaria al-Qaq, co-director of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's condition in a military hospital near Paris is described as unchanged, but the details are mysterious. Israeli officials say he is on life-support systems, while the Palestinian representative in France, Leila Shahid, says he is in a ''reversible coma'' and ''at a critical juncture between life and death.''</p>
        <p>On Friday evening a French medical spokesman, Gen. Christian Estripeau, said only that Mr. Arafat's ''health has not worsened since yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is among the best-known people in the world, and ''his face was like the flag of Palestine,'' said Shibley Telhami, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. No one else will have his credibility with the Palestinians, who gave him, like a father, the benefit of the doubt on major choices.</p>
        <p>Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, the No. 2 figure in the Palestine Liberation Organization, has made common cause with Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. Solid politicians with little popular or local base, they are seeking to embrace the two Palestinians with the most street credibility and guns behind them: the effective bosses of the security services in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Jibril Rajoub and Muhammad Dahlan, respectively.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dahlan served as interior minister in Mr. Abbas's cabinet, but it is Mr. Rajoub who controls the more important and populous West Bank.</p>
        <p>The support of Marwan Barghouti, currently serving five consecutive life sentences in an Israeli jail and popular in the street, will also be significant. There is speculation that he might at some point be freed in a prisoner exchange.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Palestinian officials and analysts say, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Qurei have opened discussions with militant groups sworn to Israel's destruction, like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whose spokesmen have called for a ''collective leadership'' in which they have a voice. Mr. Qurei may travel Saturday to Gaza, where Hamas is strong, to argue that Palestinian unity now is imperative. Gaza factions, including Hamas, issued a statement on Friday pledging stability and order.</p>
        <p>There is also money at stake. Mr. Arafat is said to have direct control over considerable sums, involving the P.L.O. as well as the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>With the Israelis, there have been contacts about preserving stability in the Palestinian lands and about Mr. Arafat's burial. Israel wants him to be buried either abroad, in Tunisia, or in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>But Israelis are willing for Mr. Arafat to have a presidential send-off, with Arab leaders in attendance -- even Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, if he wants to come -- and prominent Westerners like President Jacques Chirac of France and former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Official Western diplomatic representation will generally be at a lower level. Gaza, which is a helicopter ride from Arab nations and would not require a visit to Israel, appears acceptable to Arab leaders and the international community, but it is likely to be a focus for popular Palestinian unhappiness and unrest unless handled carefully, officials say.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians may prefer Ramallah to Gaza, and it is likely that any grave site would be described as provisional, pending formal burial in the capital of an independent Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials are also trying hard not to embrace Mr. Abbas or Mr. Qurei, in order not to ruin their chances of establishing wider credibility among Palestinians bereft at the loss of Mr. Arafat and increasingly told by some Palestinian news outlets that Israel is responsible for his apparently fatal illness.</p>
        <p>Shimon Peres, the former prime minister who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr. Arafat in 1994, said the nascent Palestinian leadership appeared ''more firmly grounded'' and more willing to confront the militants. Mr. Abbas has been clear about his opposition to terrorism and his view that the last four years of intifada have been a disaster. He will nonetheless need to show a tough side to gain popular legitimacy.</p>
        <p>''Look for a division of labor, first of all,'' said Daoud Kuttab of Al Quds University in Ramallah. Mr. Arafat was the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization; of Fatah, the largest faction in the organization; and of the Palestinian Authority, the semi-government that draws its authority from the P.L.O.</p>
        <p>Every Monday morning there are meetings of the organization's executive committee, the Fatah central committee and the Palestinian leadership, which includes the main cabinet ministers, advisers and P.L.O. faction leaders. Mr. Arafat led them all. But no single figure now will be able to do the same.</p>
        <p>''These are called institutions, with all the trappings of institutions, but they were really various instruments of Arafat's will,'' Mr. Kuttab said. ''Now all the leadership is talking about how to revive these institutions and live up to them.''</p>
        <p>Most analysts agree that the key to the future lies in the deliberations of the Fatah central committee, a group of about 20 members who derive their authority from the faction's revolutionary council, a group of 100 who in turn derive their authority in turn from a large general assembly to which there have been no elections in 20 years. It is the central committee that will ''cut up the cake and decide who will be where and doing what,'' Mr. Kuttab said.</p>
        <p>The first public meeting should be the P.L.O. executive committee, which will announce its new chairman -- expected to be Mr. Abbas, currently No. 2. That choice is subject to ratification by the Palestinian National Council, some of whose members live abroad, but the council is unlikely to interfere.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Authority has a basic law, a form of constitution, that says the speaker of the Parliament will succeed as president of the authority for 60 days, during which elections will be held. When the law was passed the speaker was Mr. Qurei; now it is an Arafat functionary, Rawhi Fattouh, who has no real role.</p>
        <p>Whether the presidency will now become more ceremonial, as Washington has asked, formalizing greater power in the hands of the prime minister, is an open question. Similarly, with municipal elections already scheduled for Dec. 8, will the Israelis take the necessary steps for a presidential election to be possible?</p>
        <p>And if there is a presidential election, will Hamas take part? Hamas is actively campaigning in the local elections, but to run for the presidency would be to recognize the Palestinian Authority, which grew out of the 1993 Oslo accords, which Hamas and other militant groups opposed.</p>
        <p>Even the relationship between a provisional president and the prime minister, let alone with a P.L.O. chairman, is unclear. The prime minister's job is a recent invention, and Mr. Arafat never approved some crucial reforms that gave the prime minister more power, especially over the police and other security forces. Nor, for that matter, did Mr. Arafat ever sign the local election bill.</p>
        <p>Most of these procedural questions can be fudged. But the gap Mr. Arafat leaves cannot be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qaq, the researcher, said the future would be duller, more formal and more bureaucratic. And Mr. Abbas in particular will have a heavy legacy, having turned his back on Mr. Arafat and quit as prime minister after only four months and quit as a member of the Fatah central committee, too.</p>
        <p>Although he has now rejoined the committee, Mr. Qaq said, ''How does he get his credibility back?'' Mr. Qurei is perceived as a failed prime minister who has delivered little, even if Mr. Arafat's meddling was one of the causes.</p>
        <p>''All of these memories will reemerge when Arafat is in the ground,'' Mr. Qaq said. An even more important burden, he said, will be Mr. Arafat's refusal to sign a peace treaty with Israel. ''Arafat wouldn't sell out -- that's how Palestinians perceive it,'' Mr. Qaq said. ''That's a difficult legacy. His successors will have their hands cuffed.''</p>
