        <p>The promoter was heavyset, balding, clean-shaven, round-faced and smooth-skinned. When he approached his marks, he was blunt but also unpredictable -- he would show up late for meetings, sometimes with a cane, sometimes not. It was all part of the game.</p>
        <p>''Charming would have blown the whole thing,'' said one of his intended marks, Elliott Bey.</p>
        <p>But his scheme, in the end, was beautifully simple, and his marks, it turns out, were well chosen: young first-time business owners, pressed to fulfill their dreams quickly or lose their expensive storefronts, working like mad to grab a piece of the much-promoted, ill-defined New Brooklyn of world-class theater, shopping, a basketball stadium, the works.</p>
        <p>Dropping the names of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the big-time developer Bruce C. Ratner, the promoter, identified by the authorities as Mark Edwards, 46, gently separated small-business owners from their money by convincing them that he was a clever, connected publicist, and that he would deliver them endless promotion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards worked his way across gentrifying strips of Brooklyn, following the path of blossoming boutiques, cafes and salons through Fort Greene and Park Slope, then halfway up the raging restaurant strip of Smith Street. He took money, the authorities said, but produced no publicity campaign, and he made it as far as NY Perks, Mr. Bey's new coffee shop, before his scheme came undone. Through coincidence and dumb luck, Mr. Bey, the newest new guy on the block, got wise to the grift, reeled the con man in over the course of a month and a half, then stung him right back.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Edwards walked into NY Perks on Wednesday, light rock was oozing from the speakers, and the sleek round tables were filled with people who were not regular customers. He walked to the back bar, where he spoke for an hour with Mr. Bey and an undercover police officer, then accepted a check for $959.88, walked out the door and was placed under arrest.</p>
        <p>He was arraigned Thursday on forgery and fraud charges, and he remained in jail yesterday, unable to come up with $5,000 bail.</p>
        <p>Tahisi Graham, who is Mr. Edwards's wife and the owner of his employer, the TGE Marketing Company, said the criminal charges were an overreaction to business disputes.</p>
        <p>''They should have just asked for their money back,'' she said of the small-business owners. ''I don't see why he has to go through this.''</p>
        <p>Detectives assigned to the city's Department of Investigation, who made the arrest, said they were not yet sure of the scope of the con game, and their investigation was continuing. But court documents and interviews with shop owners show that Mr. Edwards approached at least a dozen businesses in a trek of months that traced the borough's increasing economic activity.</p>
        <p>As far back as the beginning of the summer, Mr. Edwards was floating a variant of his pitch in Fort Greene, near the spot where Mr. Ratner hopes to build a stadium for the New Jersey Nets basketball team. Catering to the black population in the neighborhood, where African restaurants thrive, Mr. Edwards promoted a minority business development plan similar to the neighborhood development plans he would later describe in other areas.</p>
        <p>By mid-July, business owners said, he was passing out fliers in Park Slope with a somewhat different sales pitch. He carried pamphlets marked ''New York City Department of Small Business Services'' and ''Business Improvement Districts,'' altered to include promotional information about TGE Marketing, as well as materials using the city logo and the logos for radio stations.</p>
        <p>Every successful confidence game depends on the mark's willingness to try to get something for nothing, and Mr. Edwards offered radio and online advertising heavily subsidized by city economic development programs and by private developers, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
        <p>''He said Bruce Ratner's going to eat a piece, the radio stations, the city of New York -- it will be very cheap, very affordable because they wanted to promote the area,'' said Sergio Mormile, the owner of Vespa Salon on Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mormile bought in for $479.94, the price of partial participation. A few blocks away, David Silver signed up his store, Second Helpings, for full participation at $959.88. ''We could have used the boost,'' Mr. Silver said.</p>
        <p>The money was deposited in a TGE Marketing account at Greenpoint Bank, according to a criminal complaint. But by early September, Mr. Edwards, who had no business relationship with the city or the radio stations, was working Smith Street, the jewel in the crown of New Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Row houses still frame the block, but fame has changed Smith Street, where a restaurant made front-page news last year for its rating in a well-known guidebook. The strip is boutiqueland, a cheery stretch of fiercely competitive stores with fanciful names and bright displays.</p>
        <p>''Established 1998,'' boasts a pottery place. Coffee table retrospectives of Playboy photographs are sold at a number of stores. A yet-to-open store called Crush uses its pastel awning to promise ''Hip Stuff You'll Want.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards -- sometimes working with a partner, sometimes sending a photographer to take promotional pictures -- worked the block, concentrating on young first-time business owners, those owners said. Patrick Watson, the owner of a wine store called Smith and Vine, bought in for $959.88.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Edwards hit every note of his marketing pitches, Mr. Watson said, his behavior seemed strange in hindsight.</p>
        <p>''They would never show up on time,'' Mr. Watson said. ''I think that was in case they got stung. They always caught you off guard.''</p>
        <p>Quietly, word started to get around. Acting on a complaint of Mr. Edwards's broken promises, passed along by the Small Business Services Department, detectives from the Department of Investigations started contacting business owners. Eventually, they found Mr. Bey at NY Perks, who agreed to help set up a sting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bey, 35, who had opened his cafe on Aug. 19, had no connections with his neighbors, and so no warning about the con. When Mr. Edwards walked in one day in early September, limping and leaning on his cane, dressed in a white button-down shirt emblazoned with radio station logos, Mr. Bey received him enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>''I'm very shrewd, I'm very savvy, and I was going to give him a check,'' Mr. Bey said.</p>
        <p>But a few days after their first meeting, Mr. Bey ran into a friend from Fort Greene who recognized Mr. Edwards from the similar minority business development pitch. But Mr. Bey did not back out. Instead, he took the detectives' number and kept in touch with Mr. Edwards.</p>
        <p>''I kept him interested,'' he said. ''They sent this clown in with a 3-meg-pixel digital camera. Even if I hadn't known it was a scam, I would have figured it out then.''</p>
        <p>After a two-week lull, Mr. Edwards came back to NY Perks on Wednesday to collect his check. When he walked in, his limp was gone, and so was his cane. The undercover officer was waiting at the back bar.</p>
