        <p>NAME -- True Story Project.</p>
        <p>FOUNDED -- 2000 in New York by Krista Smith.</p>
        <p>MISSION -- To provide professional theater training for actors and playwrights with disabilities.</p>
        <p>THE STORY -- One thing that Krista Smith does not want to do is pull on the heartstrings of people watching the disabled actors in True Story Project. ''We vehemently work against that,'' she said. ''We work against stereotypes in our storytelling.'' Pity is a no-no.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, an actress with a bent for teaching drama, says she met many artists and actors with disabilities who felt that their lives weren't being realistically depicted in plays, films and other narratives.</p>
        <p>''They couldn't find a training program that took them seriously as artists,'' she said. So she was determined to do something about it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith started the project as the educational division of an umbrella group called Visible Theater, which she founded in 2000 as a nonprofit company of professional actors. True Story is what she calls the outreach wing, an ensemble of 25 participants (including four able-bodied members) who create and perform autobiographical stories.</p>
        <p>The group tours to New York area colleges and universities, homeless shelters, corporations and organizations that help people with disabilities. So far, they have created two original productions and are working on a third that will be ready early next year.</p>
        <p>Steven Heinig, a general education adviser at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies, has been with the group since the outset, acting and writing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heinig, 36, has muscular dystrophy. Other actors in the company have neuromuscular diseases like cerebral palsy, and some have not-so-apparent disabilities.</p>
        <p>''We not only happen to be disabled but come from different backgrounds,'' Mr. Heinig said. ''The majority are disabled, but we don't believe in segregation.'' He noted the presence of some able-bodied actors in the company as well.</p>
        <p>FINANCING -- As part of Visible Theater, it is supported by donations from individuals and a $15,000 grant from the Department of Cultural Affairs in New York City.</p>
        <p>''Our grant has been reduced by $5,000 for two years,'' Ms. Smith said, ''and thus we rely heavily on donations from individuals.''</p>
