        <p>A 44-year-old woman driving through Lake Ronkonkoma early Saturday morning was critically injured by a 20-pound turkey that was hurled through her car's windshield, the Suffolk County Police said yesterday. The woman was driving west on Portion Road when someone in an oncoming car threw the turkey. A passenger in her car was able to steer it to the side of the road. The woman, whose name was not released, was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital, where she was in critical condition last night. The police said several teenagers used a stolen credit card to buy the turkey at a nearby supermarket earlier that evening. They are being sought.</p>
