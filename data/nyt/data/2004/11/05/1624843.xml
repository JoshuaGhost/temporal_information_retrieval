        <p>Arts, Briefly column; Nova Scotia Court of Appeal rules that Kemo Sabe, name given to Lone Ranger by his American Indian sidekick, Tonto, is not racist term; upholds human rights board decision that Mikmaq Indian woman, Dorothy Kateri Moore, was not demeaned or offended when her boss at sports store referred to her and others as 'kemo sabe'; photo (S)</p>

        <p>Kemo Sabe, the name given to the Lone Ranger by his American Indian sidekick, Tonto, below, in the popular westerns that ran on radio from 1933 through 1955 and on television from 1949 through 1957, is not a racist term, a Canadian court has ruled. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld a human rights board decision that said a Mikmaq Indian woman, Dorothy Kateri Moore, was not demeaned or offended when her boss at a sports store in Sydney, Nova Scotia, referred to her and others as ''kemo sabe.'' The board came to its decision after dissecting a full day's worth of ''Lone Ranger'' television episodes and concluding that although Indians were treated in a demeaning way on the programs, Tonto and the Lone Ranger were in fact partners and friends. Ms. Moore's boss, Trevor Muller, said he believed that the word meant trusted friend. But the exact meaning varies greatly depending on context and the language being spoken. A Mikmaq witness at the hearing said the word meant sneaky.</p>
