        <p>The first collaboration between two bastions of the arts on the South Bank in London was announced yesterday. A rare exhibition of the art of the Swedish polymath August Strindberg (1849-1912) will be staged in February at Tate Modern, where ''Stormy Sea,'' below, will be on view. At the same time the National Theater will stage his ''Dream Play'' in a new version written by Caryl Churchill and directed by Katie Mitchell. Nicholas Hytner, artistic director of the National Theater said, ''It is great to be able to coordinate our program to illuminate each other's work and to bring to each other's institution an audience that it might not otherwise have.'' Strindberg's art, less well known than his plays, has been compared to that of J.M.W. Turner and to artistic movements like Expressionism. The exhibition, from Feb. 17 to May 15, will include more than 60 paintings. Previews for ''A Dream Play'' begin on Feb. 4.</p>
