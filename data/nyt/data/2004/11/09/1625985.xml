        <p>Last night's sale at Phillips, de Pury &amp; Company ended with Barbara Kruger's iconic image from 1983, ''I Shop Therefore I Am.'' It was a fitting ending to an evening when prices for contemporary photography soared to new levels.

        <p>''This was a historical sale for a market born in the 80's that came to age in the 90's,'' said Philippe Ségalot, a Manhattan dealer who was a consultant for the sale. Mr. Ségalot made the winning bid for Ms. Kruger's photograph for a collector.</p>

        <p>Last night's sale at Phillips, de Pury &amp; Company ended with Barbara Kruger's iconic image from 1983, ''I Shop Therefore I Am.'' It was a fitting ending to an evening when prices for contemporary photography soared to new levels. And when Ms. Kruger's work brought $601,600, a record for her work at auction, the packed salesroom in Chelsea burst into applause.</p>
        <p>''This was a historical sale for a market born in the 80's that came to age in the 90's,'' said Philippe Ségalot, a Manhattan dealer who was a consultant for the sale. Mr. Ségalot made the winning bid for Ms. Kruger's photograph for a collector.</p>
        <p>All lots sold, for a total of $9.2 million, far above the high estimate of $6.3 million. Nine records were set.</p>
        <p>This wasn't just your everyday photography auction, and the audience knew it. The works had been collected by Baroness Marion Lambert, wife of Baron Philippe Lambert, a member of the Belgian banking family. In auctions last night and this morning, she was selling her entire collection of about 300 photographs. Together they can be seen as a time capsule of photography in the 1980's, well before most of these artists were known to collectors and well before photography was considered a highly collectible art form.</p>
        <p>Those who follow photography were familiar with the collection, which the Baroness called ''Veronica's Revenge,'' after the story of Veronica (whose real name was Berenice) the woman who wiped Jesus' brow on the way to Calvary with a cloth that miraculously retained the image of his face -- the first example of image transfer.</p>
        <p>The collection was originally intended to hang in the new headquarters of what was then the Bank Brussels Lambert Suisse SA in Geneva. But executives there were offended by the collection, saying the works were simply too shocking.</p>
        <p>The Baroness, who was not at the sale last night, said in an interview last month that she had intended the photographs to go to her children, but her daughter died in 1997 and her son has no interest in art. In contrast, the audience was willing pay a premium for her insight and vision.</p>
        <p>Four bidders tried to buy ''No,'' a 1992 self-portrait by Charles Ray that is one of an edition of just four. The crisp image of the artist, with his arms crossed, is not simply a self-portrait: it is a photograph of a sculpture of and by Mr. Ray. It was estimated to bring $300,000 to $400,000. Mr. Ségalot was also the buyer, paying $534,400 on behalf of a client. .</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Phillips' commission: 20 percent of the first $100,000 and 12 percent of any amount above that. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>A self-portrait by Cindy Sherman, ''Untitled No. 92,'' executed in 1981 as a commission by ArtForum magazine, was another hot property. Five bidders went for the image from Ms. Sherman's ''Centerfold'' series, so named because the format was chosen to fit the magazine, although it was never published at the time. This one, from an edition of 10, was estimated at $250,000 to $350,000. Dominique Levy, a Manhattan dealer, bought it for $478,400, a record for the artist at auction.</p>
        <p>Mike Kelley also broke his record. His market has been exploding recently, and his 1991 self-portrait ''Ahh Youth'' went to an unidentified telephone bidder for $411,200. The work, a strip of photographs, resembles pictures from a family album, but instead of parents or children or dogs, the artist surrounded himself with stuffed animals. It was estimated at $150,000 to $200,000.</p>
        <p>Throughout the evening, bidders fought over works by Richard Prince. ''Untitled (Girlfriend on Motorbike),'' one of his images of a biker chick from an edition of two executed in 1983, had six relentless bidders. Barbara Gladstone, Mr. Prince's dealer, stood in the back bidding tirelessly. She ended up winning the work, paying $322,800, more than four times its $80,000 high estimate. She said she was bidding for a client.</p>
        <p>Louise Lawler, currently having a show at Metro Pictures in Chelsea, was represented with one of her best-known works: ''Monogram Arranged by Mr. and Mrs. Burton Tremaine, New York City 1984,'' a photograph of a perfectly made bed with Jasper Johns's famous ''White Flag'' hanging above it. Estimated at $40,000 to $60,000, it sold to Patricia Marshall, a Manhattan art consultant, for $125,600, a record for the artist.</p>
        <p>As the crowd milled outside Phillips after the sale, some audience members said they were surprised by the high prices. ''People get carried away,'' said Edward Lee, a London dealer. Ms. Gladstone, seemed less surprised. ''It's a good collection,'' she said. ''People want quality, and this was quality.''</p>
