        <p>A golf driving range that the Town of Greenburgh had wanted two years ago for a new town hall and library will now be developed as private homes.</p>
        <p>Through its power of eminent domain, the town had sought to buy the land over the objections in 2002. A petition signed by 5,000 people helped persuaded town officials to look elsewhere. The town subsequently renovated a building at 177 Hillside Avenue for its new Town Hall.</p>
        <p>The family that owns and operates the Westchester Golf Range has contracted to sell the property to the Garson Development Company, based in Bedford.</p>
        <p>''I think the time is right for housing, and the price is right,'' said Louis Vizioli, 73, who owns the range with his wife, his sister and his brother-in-law.</p>
        <p>The developers plan to use the 32-acre parcel on Dobbs Ferry Road to build 36 houses, said Jeffrey Garson, one of the company's owners. Prices for the three-bedroom homes will start at $1.5 million, he said. Construction will begin after a required environmental review process, which Mr. Garson estimates will take 14 to 16 months.</p>
        <p>The town had originally sought to buy the property for about $7 million, said Paul Feiner, the town supervisor. The developers have arranged to buy it for $10.5 million, Mr. Garson said.</p>
