        <p>The Nets may not be a championship contender, but there is rarely a dull moment.</p>
        <p>On a day when the Nets learned that their starting shooting guard, Ron Mercer, would have exploratory knee surgery, it was the continuing saga of Alonzo Mourning that again was most compelling.</p>
        <p>With the Nets clinging to a 96-94 lead in the waning seconds of regulation Wednesday night, Mourning missed two free throws with 15.2 seconds remaining -- 3.6 seconds after Richard Jefferson missed two free throws -- that would have put the game away.</p>
        <p>Allen Iverson took advantage of the opportunity by hitting a fade-away jump shot over Jacque Vaughn with 7.2 seconds left to force overtime. The Philadelphia 76ers, who wound up scoring the final 6 points of regulation and the first 7 points in overtime, somehow rallied for a 108-100 victory.</p>
        <p>''All we had to do was make one free throw, and we had four opportunities,'' Mourning said. ''To work as hard as we did, it baffles you.''</p>
        <p>Mourning could hardly be considered the goat. He was not even supposed to play. About 90 minutes before tip-off, Nets Coach Lawrence Frank spent nearly eight minutes explaining why Mourning would sit.</p>
        <p>''This is strictly a precautionary measure,'' Frank said. ''It's strictly a measure of seeing the big picture.''</p>
        <p>The 34-year-old Mourning, who had a kidney transplant on Dec. 19, logged 37 minutes in a 64-60 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers the previous night.</p>
        <p>As if on cue, the 6-foot-10 Mourning walked past reporters and made a beeline for Frank to tell him that he would be play after all -- a conviction that Mourning shared with reporters moments later.</p>
        <p>Mourning played 40 grueling minutes -- including the five-minute overtime session -- and scored 16 points, grabbed 9 rebounds and blocked 3 shots.</p>
        <p>''I'm hurting,'' Mourning said afterward. ''My body is extremely sore. But I walked in here and said to myself, 'Think about where I've come from and where I am now.'''</p>
        <p>Jefferson pumped in a season-high 33 points to go along with 10 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''When it's all said and done, my dumb self has to step up and hit two free throws,'' said Jefferson, who had made 25 of 27 free throws in the first four games. He made 10 of 15 attempts Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'd missed more than two all season, and I missed five tonight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Nets lost their 7-foot center, Jason Collins, early in the game. He played just five minutes in the first quarter before aggravating a left ankle he sprained Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Even without him, the Nets led by 96-90 with 1 minute 10 seconds to play. But they could not put the Sixers away.</p>
        <p>''I know we came up short-handed,'' Mourning said. ''But I still look at it as progress.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>RON MERCER, who started the first three games this season at shooting guard, will have exploratory arthroscopic surgery performed on his left knee on Monday, Nets General Manager ED STEFANSKI said before the game. Mercer, who signed a two-year, $3.36 million deal during the off-season to replace KERRY KITTLES, was the Nets' third-leading scorer (9.3 points) entering the game. Stefanski said the Nets were looking to sign a shooting guard or a small forward in Mercer's absence. ''We have a list,'' Stefanski said. ''But we don't have a guy.''</p>
        <p>That list could include SHANDON ANDERSON, who was waived Wednesday by the Knicks. If the Sixers buy out the contract of GLENN ROBINSON, he could also find his way onto the list.</p>
        <p>EDDIE ROBINSON, who was bought out by the Bulls, could also be on the Nets' list.</p>
        <p>Sixers forward Corliss Williamson scored 7 of his 15 points in overtime.</p>
