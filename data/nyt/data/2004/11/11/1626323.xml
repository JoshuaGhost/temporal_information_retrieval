        <p>Caryn James Critic's Notebook column on similarities among this year's National Book Award fiction nominees: Madeleine Is Sleeping by Shun-lien Bynum, Our Kind by Kate Walbert, Ideas of Heaven by Joan Silber, The News From Paraguay by Lily Tuck, and Florida by Christine Schutt; all are written in short-story form or in bite-sized fragments, all are lacking in humor and all were written by little-known female authors living in New York City; photos (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Here, in its entirety, is a chapter from Sarah Shun-lien Bynum's ''Madeleine Is Sleeping,'' one of this year's National Book Award nominees for fiction:</p>
        <p>''Madeleine stirs in her sleep.''</p>
        <p>The four other nominees also offer bite-sized fragments. Kate Walbert's ''Our Kind'' is subtitled ''A Novel in Stories'' and Joan Silber's ''Ideas of Heaven'' is subtitled ''A Ring of Stories''; Lily Tuck's novel ''The News From Paraguay'' and Christine Schutt's ''Florida'' often break chapters into sections a quarter-page long. There's such a tyranny of white space in these already-short books that a chapter running a few pages feels like ''War and Peace.'' Have the book-award judges been watching too much MTV, causing their attention spans to atrophy?</p>
        <p>When the fiction nominees were announced, there was much grumbling about their sameness -- all women, all living in New York City, all little-known names. But the minor resemblances of sex and city are nothing next to what really makes this one of the least varied lists of nominees in recent years: a short-story aesthetic. Not one of these books is big and sprawling. And not one has much of a sense of humor.</p>
        <p>The Silber may be the most gracefully written, in the tradition of Chekhov, as it ranges from a dance studio in Manhattan to Renaissance Italy and the Boxer Rebellion in China; the Tuck may be the most accomplished, capturing an era of 19th-century Paraguayan history largely through the sympathetic eyes of the dictator's mistress; the Bynum may be the most audacious, the surreal dream of a 19th-century French farm girl. Yet all five are built on compressed observations that easily veer into precious writers' program language, too woozy and poetic for its own good.</p>
        <p>That claustrophobic sameness doesn't help readers. Awards are inherently silly, but there's a method to their silliness. Whether it's the National Book Awards, the Tonys or the Oscars, contests become guides to what the public might want to catch up on, offering something-for-everyone choices. For the best-picture Oscar, there is an art house film and a popcorn movie, a ''Lost in Translation'' and a ''Lord of the Rings.'' At last year's National Book Award ceremony, Shirley Hazzard's eloquent novel ''The Great Fire,'' about memory and lost love in postwar Japan, won over T.C. Boyle's ''Drop City,'' a raucous story of a 70's hippie commune. It was a mismatched contest, but a competition that suggested the breadth and vitality of the year's fiction.</p>
        <p>This year's list serves readers who like only a certain style -- the style, say, of Rick Moody, the novelist and short-story writer who is chairman of the five-person fiction panel and who has been known to write some woozily poetic prose of his own. Whoever comes out ahead when the winner is announced on Wednesday, it defies logic to think that five such similar books just happen to be the best of the year -- a year in which Philip Roth's chilling historical fantasy ''The Plot Against America'' and Chang-rae Lee's understated story of a suburban man's life, ''Aloft,'' deserved their extravagant critical praise.</p>
        <p>Although Chang-rae Lee is not exactly a household name, the judges apparently went out of their way to nominate books that have scarcely been noticed. And while any one of the nominees deserves more attention, the sameness of the list obscures each book's unique qualities. In Ms. Walbert's ''Our Kind,'' a circle of women friends who came of age as suburban wives in the 50's now head into a fierce old age together. The novel's most inventive element is its group narrator (''We were once rich, or close enough,'' they say), a device that captures the women's cookie-cutter lives even if it frustrates our ability to see them as individuals. Their stories are typical (that's the point), yet Ms. Walbert tells them with such sad eloquence that her book is the most affecting on the list.</p>
        <p>It's too easy, though, to confuse the mad housewives of ''Our Kind'' with the mad mother in Ms. Schutt's deft ''Florida,'' about a girl named Alice raised by a patchwork of relatives. They include a grandmother who, in one of the novel's more overwrought phrases, is ''stroked speechless.'' ''Florida'' is called a novel, but it reads like a collection of brief, linked stories; taken together, the story-structure of ''Florida,'' ''Our Kind'' and ''Ideas of Heaven'' seems like a trendy gimmick.</p>
        <p>In ''Ideas of Heaven,'' Ms. Silber's so-called ''Ring of Stories'' is a gimmick rather than an illuminating strategy, with the central character of one story reappearing as a passing reference in another. Yet the prose is so fluid that the stories' potent endings catch us off guard. An unexpected resonance lingers after reading a missionary wife's account of life in China, or hearing the Italian poet Gaspara Stampa tell her own story, in which she seems to die for love.</p>
        <p>If you were handicapping winners, Ms. Silber and Ms. Walbert would be good bets, because their solid, mainstream works are less likely to divide judges' opinions than the stronger voices in ''Madeleine Is Sleeping'' or ''The News From Paraguay.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bynum's extravagantly imagined ''Madeleine'' enters the sleeping heroine's dreams of gypsies and circuses, as childhood veers into a precocious sexuality in a fantasy influenced by writers from Ludwig Bemelmans to Angela Carter. The novel is lovely, yet transparently the work of an ambitious young writer more enamored of language than substance. She's 32 and this is her first book, while the other nominees have previous books behind them. No surprise: many are volumes of stories.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tuck's ''News From Paraguay'' may be the best book on the list, because it uses concision so richly. Ella Lynch, the Irish courtesan, drifts through Paraguay's upheaval as a powerless observer, even while those around her resent what they see as her influence. Ella's fictional diaries and letters are incorporated into a third-person narrative, all written with a precision that unfolds to illuminate a selfish woman who blunders her way into history, the country she adopts and the dictator who gives her a family even while leading it to destruction.</p>
        <p>But let's keep dictatorships in novels, not on judges' panels. By trying to strong-arm readers' taste, the judges are guaranteeing that their prize remains marginal. A National Book Award doesn't vault a writer into the upper reaches of American literature, as the Pulitzer Prize often does, and narrow-minded nominations like these help explain why. Philip Roth shouldn't automatically be nominated just for being Philip Roth, but he shouldn't be punished for it either.</p>
