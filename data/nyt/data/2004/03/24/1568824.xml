        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The White House's response to accusations by Richard A. Clarke, the former counterterrorism chief (''Ex-Bush Aide, Finding Fault, Sets Off Debate,'' front page, March 23), raises two interesting questions.</p>
        <p>First, if Bush administration officials were as serious about Al Qaeda as they say, why did they downgrade Mr. Clarke's counterterrorism post at the beginning of the administration?</p>
        <p>Second, if Vice President Dick Cheney is correct in stating that Mr. Clarke was not in the ''loop,'' why would an administration that says it is serious about terrorism not keep its chief counterterrorism expert in the loop?</p>
        <p>I believe that the answer is obvious. Before 9/11, the Bush administration did not see the Qaeda threat as serious. Rather than admit that, it prefers to attack the credibility of its critics.</p>
