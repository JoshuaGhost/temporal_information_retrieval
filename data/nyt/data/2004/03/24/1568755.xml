        <p>William Safire (''Scandal at the U.N.,'' column, March 17) writes that Benon Sevan, head of the United Nations' oil-for-food program in Iraq, ''refused to make public what companies in what countries got Saddam's largess.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sevan received legal advice that this was privileged commercial information, which could not be made public. But details of all contracts were made available to the governments of all 15 Security Council members.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William Safire (''Scandal at the U.N.,'' column, March 17) writes that Benon Sevan, head of the United Nations' oil-for-food program in Iraq, ''refused to make public what companies in what countries got Saddam's largess.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sevan received legal advice that this was privileged commercial information, which could not be made public. But details of all contracts were made available to the governments of all 15 Security Council members.</p>
        <p>In December 1998, the United Nations' Headquarters Committee on Contracts awarded the contract for authentication of goods imported by Iraq under the oil-for-food program to Cotecna Inspections of Switzerland. It did so in full compliance with United Nations financial regulations and procurement policies, because Cotecna was the lowest bidder. No one involved in this decision was aware, at the time, of any connection between Cotecna and Secretary General Kofi Annan's son, Kojo, a former Cotecna employee who remained a consultant to the company until early December 1998.</p>
        <p>The secretary general is determined to thoroughly investigate all allegations of wrongdoing in the oil-for-food program through an independent high-level inquiry.</p>
