        <p>A dance program became a celebration when the Algerian National Ballet made its New York debut on Sunday afternoon at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center at Borough of Manhattan Community College.</p>
        <p>Many theatergoers were obviously familiar with Algerian music, so they clapped in rhythm with the company's singers, percussionists and players of oboes and stringed instruments. And they expressed their fervor with joyous ululations. During the curtain calls they rose from their seats, danced down the aisles with swaying hips and jumped onto the stage to mingle with the company.</p>
        <p>Algerians, like many others outside the English-speaking world, use the word ballet to mean any form of large-scale dance spectacle. The Algerian National Ballet, directed by Houria Zoghbi, specializes in folk songs and dances. This tour was organized by the Algerian Embassy in Washington, and proceeds from performances will benefit survivors of the earthquake in Algeria last May.</p>
        <p>In welcoming remarks Idriss Jazairy, the Algerian ambassador to the United States, expressed hope that the program would reflect his country's diversity. The result was a theatrical travelogue. During the songs and dances, slides of rural and urban Algeria were projected on the backdrop. The performers delighted the eyes in costumes of bright reds, purples, blues and greens, some adorned with elaborate embroidery.</p>
        <p>The program started when men with rifles galloped in, making whipping gestures as if to urge imaginary steeds on. They were followed by an ensemble of gliding women.</p>
        <p>Most of the women's dances emphasized smooth steps, gentle quiverings and curving arm gestures. In one lyrical scene, women raised and lowered a large filmy veil over a dancer. But there were also moments when smooth steps were contrasted with little abrupt motions.</p>
        <p>The most vigorous dances were for men. In the ''Alawi Dance,'' men holding canes shook their shoulders while lustily stamping their feet. Red capes swirled like flames about the men in the ''Burnous Dance.'' Leaping warriors with the lower parts of their faces veiled battled with swords in the ''Tuareg Dance.'' But women with pleading arms helped bring about a harmonious reconciliation.</p>
        <p>It was easy to understand why these impassioned performers eventually inspired the audience to dance in harmony with them.</p>
