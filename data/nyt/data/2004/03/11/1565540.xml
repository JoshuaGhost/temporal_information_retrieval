      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Canada's exports shrank 4.7 percent in January, largely as a result of a decline in shipments of motor vehicles and parts to the United States, Statistics Canada reported. With imports also falling, the over all trade surplus dipped fractionally to 5.2 billion Canadian dollars ($3.93 billion). The decline in exports was the biggest in nine months, leading some analysts to forecast that the Bank of Canada will lower interest rates next month for the third time this year as a way of putting a brake on the strong Canadian dollar and making exports more competitive.</p>
