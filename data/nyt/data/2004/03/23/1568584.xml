        <p>Adin Brown has seen the parade of American goalkeepers going to Europe, and he has promised himself not to let the next one pass him by.</p>
        <p>''It has been a dream of mine to play in Europe,'' Brown, the starting keeper for the New England Revolution, said in a recent telephone interview. ''In the past, maybe I didn't push hard enough, but I won't make that mistake again.''</p>
        <p>Brown is an imposing 6 feet 5 inches and 225 pounds. He is intense, quick and has drawn the attention of European clubs from Norway to the Netherlands to France and Spain. Several years ago, Brown was the starter on the United States under-23 team and Tim Howard, now with Manchester United, was his backup. Brown, who is strong handling crosses, could develop into a better player than Howard. But it is unlikely Brown will play in England because of complicated British work-permit rules.</p>
        <p>''Having a player like Timmy at Man U. only makes M.L.S. look better,'' said Brown, an all-American at William and Mary, where his father played football in the late 1960's. ''There are three American keepers in the Premier League and they are among the top 10 over there.'' In addition to Howard, Kasey Keller plays for Tottenham and Brad Friedel for Blackburn.</p>
        <p>Brown, who earns about $150,000 a season in Major League Soccer on a contract that runs through the 2005 season, could end up in Europe when the transfer period begins in August -- which will be during the M.L.S. season.</p>
        <p>During the Revolution's recent training camp in the Azores, the Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, which will lose its starting keeper, Ronald Waterreus, after this season, invited Brown for a trial. New England refused permission. Brown's agent, Jan Schiefloe, said in an e-mail message that Brown would play out his contract if a transfer deal (which could bring M.L.S. $750,000 to $1 million) is not completed in August. That would mean Brown could leave on a free transfer, the way Clint Mathis and Carlos Bocanegra recently did.</p>
        <p>In December, Brown was to have a tryout with Feyenoord, another Dutch club, for two weeks. But that plan fell through when he had surgery on a torn oblique muscle in his abdomen in mid-December.</p>
        <p>''I'm really not going to be picky,'' Brown said. ''I've got this dream.''</p>
        <p>MANCHESTER UNITED  Howard Gets a Break</p>
        <p>The highest-profile American abroad, Tim Howard, has seen his endless season of soccer end -- at least for a game.</p>
        <p>Howard had allowed 19 goals in his last nine games for Manchester United before being benched in Saturday's 3-0 victory over Tottenham in the English Premier League. In 22 games from the start of the season (in all competitions) until Jan. 1, Howard had 18 victories, allowing only 11 goals and earning 13 shutouts.</p>
        <p>But it seems that Howard and the club have badly suffered from the suspension of Rio Ferdinand, who is out until September after missing a drug test last year. The Red Devils have slumped to third place in the Premier League and were bounced from the Champions League by Porto two weeks ago. Their lone chance for a bit of glory will come in successive matches against their archrival, Arsenal, on Sunday at Highbury and April 3 in a semifinal of the F.A. Cup at Villa Park in Birmingham. Roy Carroll, Howard's Irish backup, will most likely play against Arsenal this week, but Howard may start in the Cup semifinal.</p>
        <p>Howard's acquisition from the MetroStars last summer kept Carroll on the bench and sent the previous starter, Fabien Barthez, back to Marseille in France. But it has been a long year for Howard.</p>
        <p>''I just wanted to give Tim Howard a break mentally,'' Manchester United Manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports News. ''He's been sensational and he's going to be a top keeper.</p>
        <p>''But we'll give Roy a chance the next three games and see how he does. Maybe I'll keep him in after a shutout.''</p>
        <p>Corner Kicks</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES -- Major League Soccer's marketing arm, Soccer United Marketing, will soon take over the promotion of the national team. S.U.M., which already promotes the national team of Mexico, is taking over from IMG after that company relinquished its rights.</p>
        <p>METROSTARS -- The northern New Jersey town of Pequannock last week approved a development plan along Route 23 that would include a training center and office space for the MetroStars. The complex would include two full-size outdoor fields, one grass and one artificial turf with lights. The club expects the new facility to be ready sometime next year.</p>
        <p>CONCACAF CHAMPIONS CUP -- San Jose and Chicago each play host to return legs tomorrow after losing badly in quarterfinal openers last week. The Earthquakes lost, 3-0, to L.D. Alajuelense in Costa Rica; and the Fire lost, 5-5-2 to C.L. Financial in Trinidad.</p>
        <p>WORLD CUP QUALIFYING -- Canada will play host to both of its Concacaf qualifying matches against Belize; playing in Kingston, Ontario, June 13; and June 16 at a site to be determined. Belize had been expected to play host to Canada on June 20, but officials there requested the switch. . . . Also in Concacaf, Bermuda and the Dominican Republic advanced to the second round.</p>
        <p>WORLD CUP QUALIFYING II -- Ailton, a Brazilian who is playing for Werder Bremen in Germany, had hoped to play in qualifying matches for Qatar. But FIFA introduced emergency rules last week to stop ''players with no obvious connections to the new country,'' FIFA said in a statement. Qatar was also ready to naturalize the brothers Dede and Leandro, who play for Borussia Dortmund.</p>
        <p>M.L.S. -- San Jose's Ryan Cochrane, a defender who was the fifth selection over all in January's M.L.S. draft, will be out for a least a month after tearing the meniscus in his left knee on Friday. . . . Yesterday, Colorado signed the midfielder/defender Antonio de la Torre, 26, who holds dual Mexican/United States citizenship.</p>
        <p>FRANK SIMEK -- The American defender was recently named captain of Arsenal's reserve team, which has a 3-1-1 record with Simek wearing the captain's armband.</p>
        <p>GOAL NO. 1 -- Freddy Adu, a second-half substitute, scored a goal in his professional debut as D.C. United defeated the Charleston Battery of the A-League, 2-1, in a preseason match Saturday night in South Carolina.</p>
