        <p>From the joys of a fruity Beaujolais to the miseries of hangovers and alcoholism, humanity has, through the ages, felt the effects of that potent and universally consumed substance, ethanol.</p>
        <p>Countless theories have been proposed for people's love of drink. But recently, a small group of scientists has begun to explore the idea that the ultimate explanation lies deep in the evolutionary past.</p>
        <p>Primate ancestors of Homo sapiens were highly dependent on fruit, and so, the new theory goes, they developed a strong attraction to the ethanol that naturally spikes lusciously ripe and overripe fruits. This predilection was then passed on to humans.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis, proposed by Dr. Robert Dudley of the University of California at Berkeley, was the subject of a symposium at the meetings of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in New Orleans in January. Scientists say the idea has already led researchers into curious new fields of inquiry, from pondering drunken elephants and tipsy songbirds to studying forests full of fermenting fruit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Dudley, a physiologist, said that most addictive substances were relatively new to the human species.</p>
        <p>But ethanol, he said, ''has a deeper historical perspective that can be brought to bear on modern day problems. Basically, this is not an accident.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Doug Levey, an ecologist at the University of Florida, who also spoke at the symposium, said the hypothesis showed the power of adopting an evolutionary approach to human health, a method of inquiry known as Darwinian medicine.</p>
        <p>''An evolutionary biologist will argue that human traits like susceptibility to alcohol did not arise de novo, that there's some evolutionary basis for them,'' said Dr. Levey, adding that the hypothesis ''may be right and it may be wrong, but it gets us thinking in a different way.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dudley said that when he first had the idea that humans' attraction to ethanol might be related to the fruit-eating habits of human ancestors, it seemed too obvious.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Somebody else must have thought of this,' '' he said. ''But nobody had.''</p>
        <p>Researchers say that while today's humans are voracious omnivores, eating a smorgasbord of meat, vegetables and other foods, prehuman ancestors were devoted fruit eaters.</p>
        <p>An attraction to the plumes of ethanol that waft from ripening fruit would have been useful, drawing them to a precious resource in the humid forests where they lived.</p>
        <p>''In the tropics, ripe fruit goes quickly,'' said Dr. Dudley, noting that many animals could be found feasting at a laden tree. ''The faster you can find it, the better.''</p>
        <p>Ethanol-loving primates may have been rewarded once more, if the alcohol acted as an appetite stimulant, quickly helping them gobble more food. The alcohol may also have served as a source of important calories.</p>
        <p>''We're programmed to be attracted to food items that were very beneficial to our ancestors but were difficult to come by,'' said Dr. Levey, like fats, sugar and, if the new hypothesis proves correct, ethanol.</p>
        <p>''In today's society, we can create large quantities of these foods,'' he said. ''But then we tend to overconsume them.''</p>
        <p>So just as our ancestors' attraction to sugar and high-calorie foods has resulted in the health problems of today like obesity and diabetes, the scientists say, a once beneficial attraction to ethanol may underlie excessive drinking.</p>
        <p>So far the evidence for the hypothesis is largely circumstantial. For example, Dr. Dudley points out that primates, not noted for their olfactory sense, are known to have a higher neurological sensitivity to the smell of ethanol than other mammals, their neurons firing away at the scent of drink.</p>
        <p>On a more anecdotal note, he added, aperitifs are known to increase the rate of food consumption in humans, perhaps just the way a dash of ethanol would have helped a human ancestor at the fruit tree. And, Dr. Dudley asked, what about fruit cordials? Could they be tapping into an ancestral attraction to a mix of alcohol and fruits?</p>
        <p>The researchers said that additional support for the hypothesis could be found in a few studies that showed that alcohol was not only available, but ubiquitous in wild fruits.</p>
        <p>As in fermenting wine, yeasts in the ripening fruit use the available sugars to produce ethanol, which accumulates as the fruit ripens. Alcohol can even be found in fruits bought at the grocery store, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>In fact, ethanol is so easy to brew up that it has been proposed by some as a renewable, alternative fuel source to be produced from fermented corn.</p>
        <p>The scientific literature is replete with reports of drunken animals, offering evidence -- albeit shaky -- that ethanol can affect creatures in the wild.</p>
        <p>''There are elephants who become drunk and run through villages,'' said Dr. Katharine Milton, a primatologist at Berkeley, who also spoke at the symposium. ''There are drunken warthogs, drunken birds.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dudley said there were also anecdotal reports of dogs getting tipsy from eating fermenting dough and fish becoming inebriated from fermenting fruit fallen into rivers.</p>
        <p>One study, of waxwings, tested the ethanol concentrations in the birds' livers and showed that they had died from alcohol poisoning, apparently from eating an excess of fermenting fruit, he said.</p>
        <p>Curiously, accounts of drunken monkeys are nowhere to be found, a lack, Dr. Milton said, that argues against the hypothesis. In what she called her ''intoxicated primate survey,'' Dr. Milton polled 20 primatologists, many, like her, with years of field experience.</p>
        <p>The primatalogists reported on 22 different primate species, including all the great apes, and various new and old world monkeys.</p>
        <p>''I was sure someone would tell me they'd seen a drunken monkey or a drunken ape,'' Dr. Milton said.</p>
        <p>But the closest she got was a sighting of a possibly inebriated primate in Madgascar called a silky sifaka. The species, however, is not known to eat much fruit, Dr. Milton said, making it unlikely that fruit ethanol was affecting the animal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Milton said she also asked the primatologists whether their species had been observed to prefer more fermented, and therefore more alcohol-rich fruit, but they could produce no examples.</p>
        <p>''One of my respondents got quite indignant that I'd even suggest that something as sophisticated as a chimpanzee would eat an overripe fruit,'' Dr. Milton said.</p>
        <p>Skeptics note that the tests conducted so far have found only very small doses of alcohol in fruits, perhaps one-tenth or one-hundredth of that found in a single cocktail. Scientists say they are now working to determine just how much ethanol is in the fruits that wild primates eat.</p>
        <p>Still, a host of human studies demonstrating the beneficial health effects of alcohol, when consumed at low levels, lend weight to the idea that ethanol may have been a significant part of the prehuman diet.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the researchers are drawing upon evolution to explore a variety of questions about the relationship between humans and alcohol, including how people came to drink to excess and why men and women differ in their tolerance of alcohol.</p>
        <p>Dr. Milton has even proposed that humanity's greatest evolutionary asset may also be the source of its greatest alcohol-related troubles, saying, ''In apes, there's nothing like human consciousness,'' so why should they drink?</p>
        <p>''Humans might be the only animals that wish to escape from their own consciousness,'' she said.</p>
