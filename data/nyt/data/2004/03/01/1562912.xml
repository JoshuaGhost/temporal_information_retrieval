        <p>''The Mystery of Natalie Wood,'' a three-hour movie that will have its premiere tonight on ABC, opens with a title card that says, ''The following dramatization is interpretive of published accounts and personal interviews.''</p>
        <p>Not again. Another movie that'll go nowhere.</p>
        <p>Sure, the screenwriter, Elizabeth Egloff, read two biographies and a bunch of newspaper clippings about Natalie Wood. And evidently Peter Bogdanovich, the director, demanded talking-head interviews and Hollywood newsreels to dilute his fiction with the tedium of fact. Why oh why is it always assumed that television movies are good only to the degree that they resemble documentaries?</p>
        <p>The movie itself is all right. Wood comes across as a micromanaged child star who goes on to become a drunk, a mother, a Hollywood habitué and a respectable actress. From time to time Justine Waddell, who plays Wood as an adult, affects the standard jittery, alley-cat manner that for years has stood for ''studio controlled'' and ''Valium enriched'' in movies like this one. (Could someone please verify whether troubled studio actresses really used to twitch so much?) To drive the point home we also see plenty of scenes of Wood washing down all manner of little helpers with Pouilly Fuissé, her drink of choice.</p>
        <p>She also fights with her ghastly mother, a Russian mommie dearest determined to make Natalie (born Natasha Zakharenko) lead a trash-can life of misery and celebrity. The mother, Maria Gurdin (Alice Krige), is floridly evil, forcing Natalie to suck up to directors and avoid other children. Clinging to some idle words spoken by a fortuneteller, she furthermore warns her daughter to avoid ''dark water,'' an admonition that, to give the devil her due, might have come in handy later in Natalie's life.</p>
        <p>We see Wood juggling men, not so much a heartbreaker as a good old girl, nervy, bored and accustomed to seducing for a living. The parade of glamour boys in this movie includes Warren Beatty (Matthew Settle), Christopher Walken (Malcolm Kennard) and of course Robert Wagner (Michael Weatherly), whom Wood married twice. Instead of acting, the men cast as movie stars turn in impressions and mimicry; this is another hallmark of a dramatization.</p>
        <p>Though she relies on the jitters too much, Ms. Waddell, a South African, manages to distinguish her Wood from television versions of pill people like Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland by making her hard, ironic, nonnarcissistic and -- curiously -- no fool for love. Instead of love, she's in this life to bear children and get good roles. She does both.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, she drowns. How does this hypertragic, Thomas Hardy ending fit the film structurally? How does it make aesthetic sense? It does not of course.</p>
        <p>If the movie had the courage of fiction, it might have used weird effects to get into Wood's head or produce an animated sequence underwater, or even to resurrect her in a mad apotheosis. In contrast, an interpretive dramatization like this one can only be unsatisfying as it hews to the news. Wood's death was a fluke; on television, as in life, it contains no beauty or meaning at all.</p>
        <p>THE MYSTERY OF NATALIE WOOD  ABC, tonight at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7 Central time  Directed by Peter Bogdanovich; written by Elizabeth Egloff, based on books by Suzanne Finstad and Warren G. Harris; produced by Richard Fischoff and Randy Sutter; director of photography, John Stokes.</p>
        <p>WITH: Justine Waddell (Natalie Wood), Michael Weatherly (Robert Wagner), Matthew Settle (Warren Beatty), Colin Friels (Nick Gurdin), Elizabeth Rice (teenage Natalie), Malcolm Kennard (Christopher Walken) and Alice Krige (Maria Gurdin).</p>
