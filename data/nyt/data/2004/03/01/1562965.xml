      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In the publicity-hungry world of politics, where strategists thirst for the kind of name recognition once reserved for candidates alone, Mary Beth Cahill is suddenly the campaign manager du jour.</p>
        <p>Nothing could make her more uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Now that her candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, has won 18 of 20 Democratic contests and appears poised to become the nominee, Ms. Cahill is presiding over one of the more remarkable political revivals in recent times. Yet in this era of big-name handlers, Ms. Cahill, 49, is an anomaly: a new face in presidential politics who holds fast the old-fashioned belief that the aide should never outshine the boss.</p>
        <p>The Kerry race is her first presidential campaign, and she is conducting it almost entirely behind the scenes, from her Spartan third-floor office in the Capitol Hill town house that serves as the campaign headquarters. Ms. Cahill does not travel with Mr. Kerry or appear on television on his behalf. Rare is the news release that bears her name.</p>
        <p>Magazines are preparing profiles of her, and television networks are making interview requests, but Ms. Cahill almost always turns them down.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that the campaign for the presidency is enhanced by much about me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A stickler for order in the usually chaotic world of politics, Ms. Cahill was schooled in the shoe-leather tactics of Boston politics and has known Mr. Kerry for decades. She took over his campaign in November, leaving her job as chief of staff to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. At the times, things looked bleak. Mr. Kerry's poll numbers were in the tank, and with his aides warring, he had fired his campaign manager.</p>
        <p>''John Kerry is going to be the nominee,'' Ms. Cahill told a friend, Joe Solmonese, back then, when most Democrats dismissed such talk.</p>
        <p>She arrived at work on her first day to find 100 nervous aides awaiting her. ''I want you all to stay,'' she told them, according to Michael Meehan, a campaign spokesman. Then, not skipping a beat, she added, ''But if you're going to leave, I want you to leave now.''</p>
        <p>People inside and outside the Kerry campaign credit Ms. Cahill with bringing order to the organization, freeing up Mr. Kerry to concentrate on getting votes rather than settling arguments between staff members.</p>
        <p>''He's much more confident,'' said James Carville, the Democratic strategist, ''and I think to a large extent, Mary Beth is responsible for that.''</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Cahill's predecessor, Jim Jordan, had kind words. ''I think the results speak for themselves,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''She walked into a very difficult situation, and she's very skillfully put an awful lot of broken pieces back together.''</p>
        <p>Some prominent campaign managers, like Mr. Carville and Joe Trippi, who worked for Howard Dean, are known for their wild, creative genius. Ms. Cahill is known for her steely calm and her administrative skills. Her strength, those who know her say, lies more in sifting through the advice of others to pulling together a coherent strategy than in her own strategizing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry's aides say Ms. Cahill works the phones constantly to supervise every detail of the campaign, like how much to spend in which advertising market or where the candidate should devote his time. Mr. Kerry talks to her three to four times a day. When there are disagreements among aides, she has the final word.</p>
        <p>That, Bob Shrum, the campaign's media strategist said, was the case in early January, when Mr. Kerry made a risky -- and pivotal -- decision to focus exclusively on winning the Iowa caucuses before campaigning in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>''There were some people arguing that we had to go to New Hampshire again before the Iowa caucuses,'' he said, ''and I remember quite distinctly what she said: 'No. We're going to Iowa and we're staying there.' And that was the end of the discussion.''</p>
        <p>In a 50-minute interview, Ms. Cahill was extremely reticent, perhaps mindful of the experience of Mr. Trippi, who was lionized for helping Dr. Dean become an Internet sensation only to be cast aside when his candidate faltered. Some say her reserve reflects shyness; others say it reflects an intense conviction that any inch of newspaper space devoted to someone other than Mr. Kerry is at best a distraction and at worst a danger.</p>
        <p>''She has a rare trait in Washington, which is she knows more than she says,'' says Luke Albee, chief of staff for Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.</p>
        <p>One thing Ms. Cahill would talk about was her decision to join what was regarded as a losing campaign. She said she did not hesitate.</p>
        <p>''His assets were undervalued,'' she said of Mr. Kerry. ''All of the stories were about campaign and about staff, and they were not about the candidate and they were not about the country. That's how people make up their minds, and that's what they vote on.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Cahill was not a household name when Mr. Kerry selected her, she was hardly anonymous. The eldest of six children, Ms. Cahill grew up in a working-class family outside Boston and got her start in politics as a receptionist for the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, the congressman and Jesuit priest who gave up his House seat on orders of the Pope.</p>
        <p>She went on to manage House and Senate races in New England, including that of Mr. Leahy and gained a reputation for winning tough fights. She worked for Michael S. Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor; served as a top aide to President Bill Clinton; and ran Emily's List, a political action committee that helps elect Democratic women.</p>
        <p>If there is a criticism of Ms. Cahill, it is that she has what one former aide to President Clinton described as an insensitivity to internal politics. One of her first acts at the Clinton White House was to fire a slew of staff members, a move that did not make her many friends.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, says Ms. Cahill simply did what she had to do. ''She didn't always make friends with everybody,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''But if I had to pick between the decision and the friendship, I'd say she made the right calls.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cahill also has a legion of devoted followers, and most of them have some kind of story about her. Mr. Albee said the first thing Ms. Cahill did when she walked into a campaign office was ''to clean the bathroom and empty the trash'' -- her way of signaling that nobody is above any task, however menial. Ms. Cahill insists she has not done that at the Kerry campaign.</p>
        <p>But the most telling story may belong to Mr. Solmonese, now chief of staff for Emily's List. Back when Ms. Cahill was working for Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Solmonese was running Representative Barney Frank's re-election campaign. Mr. Frank was about to do a news conference in Boston with Mr. Solmonese stuck across town.</p>
        <p>''I called Mary Beth,'' he recalled, ''and I said, 'Barney Frank is walking out of the State House to do a press conference in the rain, and I'm worried, because he is going to get soaked.' When I turned on the television, standing behind him, holding an umbrella, was Mary Beth.''</p>
