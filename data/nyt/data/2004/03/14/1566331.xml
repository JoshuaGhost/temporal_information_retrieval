        <p>SOPRANOS have long been on the large side. The appetite of the diva Luisa Tetrazzini was so legendary that a pasta dish was named after her. Audiences suspended disbelief as hefty sopranos sang the part of poor, hungry Mimi in ''La Bohème.'' And male tenors have been just as big.</p>
        <p>Yet the accomplished soprano Deborah Voigt revealed last week that she was let go from the coming production of ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' at the Royal Opera House in London because the company decided she was too big for the costume -- a little black dress. The Royal Opera at Covent Garden replaced Ms. Voigt in her signature role with a little-known, but thinner, German singer, Anne Schwanewilms.</p>
        <p>What is going on? Has society's increasing emphasis on celebrity and looks finally infiltrated the sacred bastions of classical music?</p>
        <p>''The age of big singers is over,'' wrote The Evening Standard on Wednesday in the wake of the Voigt news. ''Where Pavarotti once gave permission for singers to overspill, opera in the new century is skimpy and severe.''</p>
        <p>The Royal Opera claims it merely decided that Ms. Voigt did not fit its concept for the opera -- no pun intended -- which included slight modern costumes.</p>
        <p>Covent Garden's casting director, Peter Katona, told The Sunday Telegraph: ''In making these kinds of decisions, it is not just a question of how someone looks; it is also how they move onstage.''</p>
        <p>But the Royal Opera's decision also seems to reflect the increasing pressure on performing arts institutions to lure new, younger audiences and to compete with the ever mounting surfeit of entertainment alternatives. The New York Philharmonic, for example, recently experimented with MTV-like video screens during a concert rehearsal -- something the Vancouver Symphony and the Atlanta Symphony have already used.</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Voigt seems resigned to her fate. ''I have big hips, and Covent Garden has a problem with them,'' she said. ''Or at least their casting director, Peter Katona, has the problem, and he's made it clear that I won't be singing in his house as long as he's around. Which is sad.''</p>
