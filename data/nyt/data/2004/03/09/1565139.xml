        <p>Organizers announced plans yesterday for the first New York Comedy Festival, a weeklong series of performances by comedians at theaters and clubs around the city. The festival, to be held in November, is a joint effort by Carolines on Broadway, a comedy club, and NYC &amp; Company, the city's tourism agency. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced the initiative at a City Hall news conference, where a drummer fired off rimshots to punctuate droll jokes by the mayor. Caroline Hirsch, the club's owner, advised Mr. Bloomberg not to give up his day job.</p>
