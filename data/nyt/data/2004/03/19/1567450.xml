        <p>Ireland's phone company Eircom, owned by consortium led by Providence Equity Partners and billionaires George Soros and Sir Anthony O'Reilly, will sell Eircom to public March 19 at 1.55 euros a share in offering that will value company at $1.15 billion; required initial investment of 40,000 euros ($49,000) will prevent small investors from losing their money as they did when initial public offering in 1999 turned out to be financial disaster; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In 1999, at the peak of the telecommunications boom, Dominic Turner took his government's advice. Along with 350,000 others -- nearly one in every seven Irish people -- he bought shares in Eircom, the state-owned phone company.</p>
        <p>It was the highest-profile initial offering ever on this country's small stock exchange, and turned out to be one of the most disastrous. By 2001, when private investors bought out the company, Mr. Turner, a 31-year-old Web and sound designer, had lost about two-thirds of the 1,500 euros (worth $1,900 now) he spent on Eircom stock.</p>
        <p>The marketing around the offering included billboard ads and cabinet ministers encouraging people to buy Eircom shares with the confidence that the government would not cheat them. ''I fell prey to what was going on at the time,'' Mr. Turner said. ''The whole country fell prey to that.''</p>
        <p>Now, after owning it for less than three years, those private investors -- a consortium led by Providence Equity Partners and the billionaires George Soros and Sir Anthony O'Reilly -- will sell Eircom to the public again on Friday, at 1.55 euros a share in an offering that will value the company at $1.15 billion. But this time, with a required initial investment of 40,000 euros (currently about $49,000), small investors like Mr. Turner are not part of the picture.</p>
        <p>''We're in a very different environment now, and this is a very different company,'' said Tricia McEvoy, an analyst at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. ''I hope people have learned lessons from those valuations.''</p>
        <p>Given the turnaround in telecommunications in the last year, the partners in the consortium, known as Valentia, will see healthy returns, perhaps well over 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Providence Equity bought 44 percent of the company for $280 million and received a $202 million nondiluting dividend when Eircom refinanced its debt last year.</p>
        <p>It could make an additional $457 million if the shares open at 1.61 euros, said Andrew Cole, a spokesman for Providence Equity in New York.</p>
        <p>''I knew the big guys were going to do well out of it this time,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It shows there are loopholes in how we deal with big business.''</p>
        <p>Eircom is a far cry from the high-flying behemoth it was in the 1990's, when it founded an online media publishing unit and ran the country's biggest cellphone company. Vodafone bought its wireless arm in 2001 for 3.64 billion euros, and the Web-based magazines have long since closed.</p>
        <p>No one doubts that Eircom has become leaner and more efficient under its chief executive, Philip Nolan, who cut its work force to less than 8,000 from 12,000 and focused on its fixed-line business.</p>
        <p>While Eircom lost 72 million euros on revenue of 1.23 billion euros in the last nine months of 2003, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose to 450 million euros from 440 million euros in all of 2002.</p>
        <p>And despite the extensive control held by the company's unions -- a trust that owns shares on behalf of employees owns 30 percent of the company, and can name three people, including the vice chairman, to the board -- Eircom is widely perceived to have shed the sluggish workplace culture once common in state-run companies here.</p>
        <p>''Through privatization the company has sharpened up somewhat,'' said Pat Duggan, telecom analyst at Dolmen Stockbrokers in Dublin.</p>
        <p>Instead, analysts worry about its potential for growth. Eircom now says the slow adoption of broadband Internet access in Ireland so far will allow it to tap new customers, since one million of its phone lines are connected to compatible exchanges.</p>
        <p>''When they came to market they needed some sort of growth story for it, and broadband was that story,'' Ms. McEvoy said. Only 2 percent of people in Ireland use broadband to use the Internet, compared with 10 percent in most European Union countries.</p>
        <p>Ireland, along with Denmark, has one of the toughest regulatory environments in the European Union. While Eircom, a former monopoly, has so far coped successfully with government demands that, for example, it allow competitors access to its network, it still commands 80 percent of the Irish telecommunications market by revenue. But forthcoming rules mean that ''it's not going to get any easier,'' Mr. Duggan said.</p>
        <p>And its heavy debt burden will make it difficult for Eircom to embark on any other high-growth ventures, like re-entering the wireless sector.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Eircom had 190 million euros of debt; after the offering, it will be 2.15 billion, most of which Valentia borrowed to finance the buyout.</p>
        <p>Eircom's payments on those debts do not begin until 2006, allowing it to pay generous dividends to lure investors. In aggregate, it will pay half its annual free cash flow in dividends, which in its first year as a public company are likely to be around 0.11 euro a share. That potential 6.8 percent yield is significantly higher than at most similar companies and led Mr. Duggan to liken Eircom to a utility stock rather than a typical telecommunications stock.</p>
        <p>The dividends, and promising figures like a free cash flow yield of 16 percent and a cap on annual capital expenditure at 200 million euros, is likely to attract more conservative institutional investors, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Because of the losses suffered by small investors when Eircom first went public, this offering is likely to cause ''a reopening of the barely healed wound inflicted on the national psyche,'' wrote John McManus, a columnist for The Irish Times.</p>
        <p>And as Ms. McEvoy, the analyst, pointed out, the shares are similar in their steady yields and probably limited short-term appreciation to Eircom's publicly traded debt. So Irish investors wary of Eircom's stock may just opt to buy the company's bonds instead.</p>
