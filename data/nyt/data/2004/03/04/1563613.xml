        <p>THANKS to the wonders of technology, now you, too, can live like Bill Gates.</p>
        <p>No, you can't suddenly afford to build a $50 million house overlooking Lake Washington. You will not have heated floors, sidewalks and driveways. And your monthly Citibank statement certainly won't show $46 billion on deposit.</p>

        <p>THANKS to the wonders of technology, now you, too, can live like Bill Gates.</p>
        <p>No, you can't suddenly afford to build a $50 million house overlooking Lake Washington. You will not have heated floors, sidewalks and driveways. And your monthly Citibank statement certainly won't show $46 billion on deposit.</p>
        <p>You can, however, have a big, beautiful, high-definition screen on your wall that displays rotating collections of classic paintings, just as Bill does.</p>
        <p>In fact, you may already have a high-definition TV; every month, thousands of Americans join the HDTV club. A young company called Roku has now come along with a simple question: What will appear on that $5,000 sheet of plasma when you're not watching TV?</p>
        <p>Roku suggests a slide show of high-resolution photos, nature scenes or famous paintings. That's the point of the company's first product, a slim set-top box called the HD1000.</p>
        <p>This machine has been around since November, selling -- or, rather, not selling -- for $500. Two things suddenly make it much more interesting: First, an important software upgrade, version 1.5 (a free download from rokulabs.com) that adds essentials like the ability to play music with the slide shows. Second, a price cut to $300, effective today. (If you were one of those suckers who paid $500 within the last 30 days, the company will graciously refund $200.)</p>
        <p>Now, a TV makes a bright, vivid screen for digital photos. For emotional impact, there's just no comparison between a photo on the two-inch screen of a digital camera and on, say, a 42-inch plasma screen.</p>
        <p>But as any self-respecting gadget hound can tell you, you don't have to pay $300 for this kind of thrill. SanDisk's tiny Digital Photo Viewer (about $40), for example, can ''play'' photos right off your camera's memory card. The Prismiq MediaPlayer ($200), the LinkSys Wireless-B Media Adapter (under $200) and a TiVo with the Home Media option ($100) can use your TV to present both photos and music files that are stored on computers on your home network. Heck, most digital cameras come with a cable that connects directly to the TV ($0).</p>
        <p>But only the Roku machine is designed for glorious, colorful, wide-screen high definition. Its back panel offers not only the usual S-video output and composite jacks (that red-white-yellow trio), but also component video outputs -- the red, green, and blue jacks (labeled Y, Pb, and Pr) that connect to HDTV screens. Remember, most digital cameras take pictures containing at least two million color dots (that is, two megapixels); when you display them on a POTV (plain old television), you see only a 640-by-480 sampling of those dots. The rest of the visual information is just thrown away.</p>
        <p>A typical plasma 42-inch HDTV, though, might display 1,024 by 768 pixels. You're still not seeing every dot in the photo (unless you use the Zoom button), but you nonetheless see far more detail and color. Photos look spectacular, crisp and clear on a high-def set.</p>
        <p>You can feed photos to the HD1000 in three ways. First, you can insert a memory card from your digital camera into one of the four front-panel slots (which correspond to Compact Flash, Secure Digital, Memory Stick and SmartMedia cards). A slide show of your own photos fills your screen.</p>
        <p>During playback, you can zoom in or out, pause, go back or press an Info button that reveals details like when the photo was taken and with which camera settings. A Rotate button assists with righting photos that appear rotated 90 degrees (either because you turned the camera or because you yourself were horizontal). Alas, there's only one Rotate button; if you have it set to turn the photo counterclockwise, then rotating a photo clockwise means having to press the Rotate button three times.</p>
        <p>The second source of photographic material is your home network. If you connect the Roku box using an Ethernet cable or a wireless U.S.B. adapter, its clean, well-designed menu screen lists all of the picture folders it can find on your Windows or Mac OS X computers.</p>
        <p>This part is not, ahem, the HD1000's finest moment; connecting it to a network can be about as much fun as stripping paint. The machine isn't smart enough to detect the name of your wireless network, as the TiVo can; you have to type in both the network name and your base station's ''hexadecimal WEP key,'' whatever that is, using a clumsy onscreen keyboard. (Mac fans should note that while the Roku software can ''see'' the pictures in your iPhoto folder, it is not familiar with iPhoto itself. It shows you not only your photos, but also all the low-resolution thumbnail images that iPhoto uses to reference them, as well as the unedited originals that iPhoto keeps around as backups.)</p>
        <p>The third source of photographic material is Roku Art Packs: memory cards loaded in advance with breathtaking professional photos and accompanying background music ($40 or $70, depending on their sophistication). For example, the Space set displays 47 of the Hubble telescope's greatest hits.</p>
        <p>In the Nature pack, some of the photos have somehow been animated: brooks flow, flowers blow, clouds drift across the sunset sky. Only a handful of photos in each set are alive like this, but leaving even one of them ''playing'' on your wall all day is so majestic, powerful and calming, it will probably add two years to your life.</p>
        <p>One Art Pack presents a fully animated tropical aquarium. The novelty wears off after about three clownfish, but you can have a lot of fun with it in the meantime. (''Our kids were watching too much TV,'' you can tell visitors, ''so we repurposed our set.'')</p>
        <p>But if you really want to do the Bill Gates thing, buy the Classics Art Pack. It cycles through 50 famous paintings by Monet, Manet and about 30 other dead guys whose copyrights have expired.</p>
        <p>There's no animation going on here. (Too bad; it might have been fun to see Mona Lisa changing expressions.) Still, if you do have a flat-panel TV on your wall, these paintings lend your home a very effective air of Bill Gates-ish superwealth. Hate to say it, but the vivid, glowing pixels of a TV do better justice to the color and texture of these masterpieces than dried paint.</p>
        <p>Note, however, that most high-def screens have a width-to-height ratio of 16:9. That's a great match for movies -- but, as Roku's terrific manual puts it, ''many artists (especially the pesky Renaissance types) were a bit lax in maintaining a proper 16:9 wide-screen aspect ratio.''</p>
        <p>The HD1000 therefore lets you choose how to address this mismatch in proportions (for both Art Packs and your own digital photos): you can have the pictures appear either letterboxed, with black bars on the sides, or blown up to fill the screen, even if that means that loved ones' extremities occasionally get lopped off.</p>
        <p>As a bonus, the Roku can also play digital music files, either from a memory card or from your networked Mac or PC. Alas, it recognizes only MP3, WAV, or AIFF format, not tunes you've bought from those $1-a-song Web sites like iTunes, Napster 2.0 and MusicMatch.</p>
        <p>Until the price of high-definition screens comes down from the stratosphere, appliances like this one are clearly playthings of the affluent. The HD1000 works on Ordinary-Definition TV's too, but that's squandering both its talent and your money.</p>
        <p>There's more to it, however, than snob appeal. The HD1000 can detect when there's no signal or a motionless image on the screen -- when you've paused a DVD, for example. It can automatically begin a slide show or aquarium loop after a specified period of time, making it the world's most expensive screen saver. That's a useful perk; the Achilles' heel of plasma screens is the permanent ghostly ''burn in'' that can result if you leave a stationary image on the screen too long.</p>
        <p>It would be nice if the photos could crossfade (dissolve) gently from one to the next, instead of changing abruptly. It would be nice if the company were confident enough to offer a technical-support phone number instead of cowering behind an e-mail address. And it would certainly be nice if the machine were a bit less antisocial during the network-setup phase.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, though, the HD1000 delivers spectacular images, whether yours or theirs, to the high-definition screen you spent so much money on. And at its new, infinitely more sensible price, the HD1000 merits consideration even by those in the under-$46 billion income bracket.</p>
