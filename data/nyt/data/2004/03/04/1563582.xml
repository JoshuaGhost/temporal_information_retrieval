        <p>California Grows in New York</p>
        <p>Q.  Last summer, I planted corms of blue-flowered Triteleia (Queen Fabiola) and red-flowered Dichelostemma (Ida-Maia) on my balcony in White Plains. After they died back, I stored them in their pots in a 50-degree room. They have already sprouted. Should they be given more warmth and light, or should I try to slow them down by storing them someplace colder?</p>
        <p>A.  Both plants are California natives, adapted to the West Coast climate, said Mary Sue Ittner, the online list manager for the Pacific Bulb Society, www.pacificbulbsociety.org.</p>

        <p>California Grows in New York</p>
        <p>Q.  Last summer, I planted corms of blue-flowered Triteleia (Queen Fabiola) and red-flowered Dichelostemma (Ida-Maia) on my balcony in White Plains. After they died back, I stored them in their pots in a 50-degree room. They have already sprouted. Should they be given more warmth and light, or should I try to slow them down by storing them someplace colder?</p>
        <p>A.  Both plants are California natives, adapted to the West Coast climate, said Mary Sue Ittner, the online list manager for the Pacific Bulb Society, www.pacificbulbsociety.org.</p>
        <p>They start growing in the cool, rainy season, late fall or early winter, then flower in spring or early summer, when the rains have slowed and the weather warms. Summer's heat and drought send them into dormancy until the next cool season.</p>
        <p>The larger the plant grows before warm weather, the better, so now that yours have started, you should encourage them, Ms. Ittner said. She advises more light, but not more heat: grow lights, rather than a warm windowsill. And get them outdoors as soon as you can, she said.</p>
        <p>Acclimatize them gradually, giving them more and more air and sun over a two-week period. After that, they can take full sun and night temperatures in the high 20's.</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Ittner said, although Dichelostemmas are too tender for the Northeast, Triteleia might survive in the ground. The corms will rot in warm wet soil, but if you can avoid that, why not have a try? As long as a few make it through, you are in business. Healthy Triteleia make a lot of baby corms.</p>
        <p>Both plants are sold by McClure and Zimmerman, (800) 883-6998 or www.mzbulb.com. Telos Rare Bulbs, www.telosrarebulbs.com (no phone), has a much wider selection, but in limited quantities.</p>
        <p>Indoor Tomatoes</p>
        <p>Q.  We have been starting our tomatoes in a sunny window with O.K. but not great results. The seeds germinate well, but the plants are always tall and skinny. Should I be choosing other varieties, or do I need to use more fertilizer?</p>
        <p>A.  Your seedlings are getting tall and skinny because they are stretching for the light, and more fertilizer will only make the situation worse. As is often the case, grow lights are the best solution, but not essential.</p>
        <p>If you prefer to stick with the window, you have two options. The first is to start the seeds later, just five or six weeks before setting out. Smaller seedlings will be healthier and less prone to transplant shock, so they will soon catch up.</p>
        <p>Option 2 is a foil-lined sun reflector, placed directly behind the plants.</p>
        <p>No matter what you do about the light, it would be wise to add an occasional gentle breeze or soft stroke, just enough to brush the tops lightly -- lightly! Tomato seedlings that get this attention wind up stockier than those grown completely undisturbed.</p>
        <p>Good vs. Bad</p>
        <p>Q.  I read about plants that are nematode-resistant and about beneficial nematodes, but nobody says what they are. I know they are microscopic, but microscopic what?</p>
        <p>A.  Worms, specifically roundworms: smooth, unsegmented, narrowly cylindrical invertebrates, which are pointed at both ends. There are a great many species -- somewhere around 15,000 -- and a square yard of healthy soil could contain over a million individuals.</p>
        <p>Some nematodes are parasites, which is beneficial when they live on pests, harmful when they live on plants. And those that live on animals, including pinworms, hookworms and trichinae, have caused untold misery. But most soil-dwelling nematodes are benign, free-living creatures that aid in the recycling of plant and animal debris.</p>
