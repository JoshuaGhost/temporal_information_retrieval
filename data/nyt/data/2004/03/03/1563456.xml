        <p>Correction:  March 10, 2004, Wednesday  An architectural rendering on March 3 with an article about a design by Santiago Calatrava for an apartment tower in Lower Manhattan, and another version with a front-page contents entry, carried an incomplete credit. (The error occurred again in some editions yesterday.) While Mr. Calatrava's studio created the image of the building, the background photograph was by David Sundberg/Esto.</p>
