        <p>The former Net Micheal Ray Richardson, in his first season as the Nuggets' community ambassador, said he eventually wants to get into coaching, with the Knicks.</p>

        <p>DENVER, March 2  The former Net Micheal Ray Richardson, in his first season as the Nuggets community ambassador, said he eventually wants to get into coaching, with the Knicks.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The former Net Micheal Ray Richardson, in his first season as the Nuggets' community ambassador, said he eventually wants to get into coaching, with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I think I have a lot to offer a lot of young players,'' said Richardson, who retired in 2002 after playing 13 seasons in Europe. ''I played the game for 21 years as a professional, so I think I know basketball very well.''</p>
        <p>He was barred from the N.B.A. in 1986 for repeatedly violating its drug policy but said he has been drug free for several years.</p>
        <p>Richardson said he hoped to speak with Kiki Vandeweghe, Denver's general manager, about the chance to coach after this season. Richardson said he had called and written to Isiah Thomas, the Knicks' president of basketball operation, but had yet to speak with him.</p>
        <p>At last month's All-Star Game, Commissioner David Stern said the biggest regret of his 20-year tenure was barring players like Richardson from the league. But Richardson called Stern ''a great friend,'' and said he was a help, not a hindrance. Stern called Vandeweghe and put in a good word for Richardson before he was hired.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that he should feel bad about something that he had to do,'' said Richardson, whose job description includes speaking to youngsters about the importance of getting an education and staying drug free. ''I had my chances, and he had to do what he had to do. I took my responsibility. He didn't really have to apologize. I apologized to him because he really saved my life. He helped me realize what was really going on.''</p>
        <p>Richardson, who said he averaged 15 points and 8 rebounds as a 46-year-old in his final season in France, still has style. While speaking with Nuggets players on Tuesday, he wore a belt buckle bearing his nickname, Sugar.</p>
        <p>Richardson said there was not that great a need for him to speak with today's players about drug abuse.</p>
        <p>''I think these guys understand what's really going on,'' Richardson said. ''A lot of these guys have bodyguards. When I was coming up, we didn't make enough money to have bodyguards. We were on our own. These guys got help.''</p>
