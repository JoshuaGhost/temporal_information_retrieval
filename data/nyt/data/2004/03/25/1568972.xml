        <p>Anne Midgette Critic's Notebook column reviews English-language version of Wagner's Valkyrie performed by Eos Orchestra, and Nine Circles Chamber Theater's performance of two-character version of Saint-Saens's opera When Samson Met Delilah; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Strip down opera to its bare bones and you're left with, well, sex. That seemed to be one message of the pared-down English-language version of Wagner's ''Valkyrie'' that the Eos Orchestra offered at New York University's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts last Thursday and Saturday nights. Christopher Alden staged the whole thing in a 20th-century suburban kitchen and had Siegmund and Sieglinde, a pair of unhappy teenage misfits, going at it against the wall. Frankly, Wagner's original does sex much, much better.</p>
        <p>This ''Valkyrie'' was especially disappointing because ''The Rhinegold,'' which Eos staged two years ago, was so good. One difference lay in the casting, good in ''Rhinegold,'' less so here. Vocal technique, evidently, is the province of the gods, and ''Valkyrie'' opens in the world of mortals -- Siegmund, Sieglinde and Hunding -- none of whom was able to reach celestial heights.</p>

        <p>Strip down opera to its bare bones and you're left with, well, sex. That seemed to be one message of the pared-down English-language version of Wagner's ''Valkyrie'' that the Eos Orchestra offered at New York University's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts last Thursday and Saturday nights. Christopher Alden staged the whole thing in a 20th-century suburban kitchen and had Siegmund and Sieglinde, a pair of unhappy teenage misfits, going at it against the wall. Frankly, Wagner's original does sex much, much better.</p>
        <p>This ''Valkyrie'' was especially disappointing because ''The Rhinegold,'' which Eos staged two years ago, was so good. One difference lay in the casting, good in ''Rhinegold,'' less so here. Vocal technique, evidently, is the province of the gods, and ''Valkyrie'' opens in the world of mortals -- Siegmund, Sieglinde and Hunding -- none of whom was able to reach celestial heights.</p>
        <p>As Siegmund Charles Hens clumsily wielded his solid voice to emit a raucous sound that strayed errantly from the right pitch. Michal Shamir's Sieglinde had a dark, firm middle voice that went to a kind of yodel on top.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Dove has done a truly impressive job of reducing Wagner's score for chamber orchestra. But the original opera is considerably longer than ''Rhinegold,'' and its score is richer; the truncation here was therefore more obvious.</p>
        <p>Another lesson of the evening was that even with a chamber orchestra Wagner singing needs Wagnerian voices. The vocal lines swell to climaxes that left the voice of Meryl Richardson, the Brünnhilde, ragged. Even the estimable Sanford Sylvan, whose Wotan had been anticipated for months, paled. The careful diction that stands him in good stead in lieder singing here seemed to be a kind of net, holding in his voice and emotions until the final, tantalizing phrase of his Act III farewell.</p>
        <p>The nearly unprecedented result was that Fricka (Linda Pavelka) walked off with the evening, using her voice effectively to turn in a really fine performance. Perhaps a stronger conductor than Jonathan Sheffer could have provided useful vocal guidance; he sounded out of his depth just leading the orchestra.</p>
        <p>On Friday night there was more pared-down sex at Symphony Space, where the Nine Circles Chamber Theater presented the final of two performances of its new ''When Samson Met Delilah,'' Saint-Saëns's opera reduced to two characters and a pianist (Cristina Stanescu).</p>
        <p>It wasn't exactly clear what the point of the exercise was, but the piece, though slight, was not altogether displeasing. Klara Uleman gave all she had as Delilah -- that ''all'' falling, of course, a little short of what the role actually requires, even without one of its signature arias -- and the work's creators, Jonathan Levi and Bruce Saylor, achieved a poignant effect by casting a violinist (Gil Morgenstern) as Samson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenstern did not sing, communicating solely through his instrument. This became a perfect demonstration of supreme ability in one area and awkwardness in another. (The violin got in the way, for example, when Samson and Delilah wanted to go to bed.) The performers also spoke two different musical languages: for the most part Ms. Uleman sang Saint-Saëns, while Mr. Morgenstern played Saylor. The whole thing evoked ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' From sex to self-help is but a small step.</p>
