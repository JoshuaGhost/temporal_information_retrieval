        <p>IF it weren't for Norman Rockwell, residents of Chatham and Madison would have no tidy way of summing up their adjoining towns. Take away the brigades of S.U.V.'s and Rockwell's staid, 50's-throwback vision reigns, just a 50-minute train ride from Manhattan in eastern Morris County.</p>
        <p>Nobody much wants to leave. But many people want to move in. Behind the scenes hums a real estate landscape so competitive and intense that house hunters employ all manner of tricks to outfox the competition, often before the ''for sale'' signs are even erected.</p>
        <p>''Ridiculous'' is how Karen Meyer, who grew up in Madison, describes the current market, which she said ''practically chewed me up and spit me out'' a year and a half ago, before she found a Cape Cod-style three-bedroom house in Chatham. In a two-year search for a home that included several lost bidding wars on houses in the $500,000 range, Ms. Meyer eventually leaned on whispered leads afforded her as a longtime resident.</p>
        <p>''There was one house we wanted that wasn't on the market, but my dad heard that the woman who lived there was looking to go into a retirement community,'' she said. ''So I found out she was a teacher and I tracked her down'' to a Madison elementary school.</p>
        <p>''I went right to her classroom with my son and I asked her if she was selling,'' Ms. Meyer continued. ''She took my name and number and told me she'd call me.'' The teacher did indeed call back, Ms. Meyer said, but not until after the Meyers had found their new home and moved in.</p>
        <p>Joe Sodano, a real estate appraiser with Professional Appraisal Associates in Summit, said homeowners in both boroughs had watched their houses climb in value 10 to 15 percent each year since 2000, with the average house on the market in the 40-day range, roughly a quarter of what the large companies he works with normally plan for when relocating employees.</p>
        <p>According to Multiple Listing Service figures, the average cost of a home in Chatham was $412,879 in 2000; by 2003, that figure had leaped to $584,598. In Madison, the average was $518,797 in 2000 and $654,297 in 2003. And as of Monday, only 12 homes were for sale in Chatham and 22 in Madison.</p>
        <p>''You really have to jump through hoops and pull out all the stops to find a house here,'' said Kathy Boyd, who did just that to win the four-bedroom Colonial her family recently settled on in Madison. ''Everywhere you go, you're competing against everybody else.''</p>
        <p>In a six-month search mounted in Chatham to find a bigger house for her growing family, Ms. Boyd tested several approaches. The first was one by now familiar to residents whose homes radiate ''spiffy and all done,'' a look that lures buyers eager to forgo the hiring of remodeling architects and contractors, according to Pamela Fairley, an agent with Town &amp; Country realtors in Chatham.</p>
        <p>''I put notes in 30 to 40 mailboxes saying: 'We admire your home. If you're thinking of selling, please call us,''' Ms. Boyd said. ''We heard back from maybe 10, but mostly they turned it on us. They wanted to know what we'd pay for their house.''</p>
        <p>Instead of randomly dropping the letters at houses she considered desirable, Ms. Boyd scouted for details that suggested an imminent move.</p>
        <p>''I'd walk a lot, all over the place, to find houses I thought were ready to turn over,'' she said. ''If there was no swing set, if there hadn't been a recent remodeling, it could be that they're ready to retire.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boyd said 8 or 10 of her friends in Chatham had also tried the letter-writing strategy, one successfully.</p>
        <p>One of the houses Ms. Boyd had her eye on was the object of an opening-day bidding war.</p>
        <p>''The woman selling it was very smart,'' Ms. Boyd said, ''and we knew that if we did something creative she'd go for it. So instead of writing her a letter'' detailing in groveling prose how much her family would like to live there and why they were worthy, ''I said, 'Let me write an article.' So I wrote this phony article with a picture of the house, and the headline said, 'The Boyds Find a Home.'</p>
        <p>''We won the bid,'' she said, still sounding triumphant, but the family ultimately chose not to buy the house because a town ordinance forbade expansion.</p>
        <p>Agents say they are seeing more buyers with independent streaks to match Ms. Boyd's, but add that their ideas often backfire.</p>
        <p>''One part is that you know the inventory, and you know which houses are going to go way over asking,'' said Ms. Fairley, who has been selling houses here for 10 years. Also, she said, an agent serves a crucial role as smiling matchmaker during negotiations with sellers who, more often than not, are in a position to pick and choose.</p>
        <p>''When there's a tie or when it's close, bonding things make a big difference,'' Ms. Fairley said. ''You sit down and tell the buyers' story, where they come from, what their kids are like.'' She said she carried contracts with her at all times and often ended up ''writing them on the backs of cars, because these houses go so fast.''</p>
        <p>''It's crazy and it's emotional,'' she added. ''I had one seller who felt like a buyer was willing to sell one of his children to get the house.''</p>
        <p>''People don't tend to move out of Madison,'' said Louann Gregory, a 25-year Burgdorff agent who specializes in homes in the million-dollar-plus range. ''What we see a lot of is move-up buyers -- people whose finances change, and they want a bigger house. What's been a lot of fun for me is helping the kids of parents I've taken care of.'' Although some people say the town is too homogeneous, she said, ''It's a nice, safe community, and nobody wants to leave it.''</p>
        <p>Least of all, perhaps, its agents. In their 27 years with Coldwell Banker in Chatham, Donald and Alberta Marcy have concocted their own gimmicks to secure a share of the lucrative sellers' market. Each fall, for example, they drop bags of daffodil bulbs on the doorsteps of homes they hope to acquire as listings, encouraging the recipients to remember them for future real estate deals. And they take special care of a breed of buyers Ms. Marcy and others call nesters who, as Ms. Gregory noted, are likely to stick around.</p>
        <p>''Nesters are people who come out from Hoboken or Jersey City because they've started a family,'' she said. ''We get them into play groups. And we'll drop in on them for years.''</p>
        <p>Despite the whirlwind nature of the market, the couple have also become experts at what Ms. Marcy calls staging houses -- redecorating them -- to win even bigger contracts for their sellers.</p>
        <p>''I'll bring in baskets of croissants, linen, china,'' Ms. Marcy said. ''I have garages full of art to hang on walls. We'll even carry in our own furniture. Just because you have an expensive house doesn't mean you have good taste.''</p>
        <p>''If there's a house on a busy road or that it's difficult to get people into'' -- it happens, if infrequently, in Chatham and Madison, she said -- ''we'll come up with something,'' like the raffle last year that lured fellow agents to the house of a seller who resembled Santa Claus. The winner's children received a private visit from Santa on Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p>''Those are just things you pick up after being in the business a long time,'' Ms. Marcy said.</p>
        <p>Markets do fluctuate, but there's no hint that such tricks and talents will fall into disuse. People still want to move to Chatham and Madison, and people still don't want to leave.</p>
        <p>''As long as it took, we're just so happy to be here,'' said Monica Berger, whose family lost three houses to bidding wars in her recent two-year search for a Madison home. ''My husband used to take the train'' -- part of why they chose the town -- ''but now his job has changed and he actually drives to Connecticut'' to work. Still, she said, ''we didn't want to move. We're staying put.''</p>
