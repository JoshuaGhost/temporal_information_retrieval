        <p>Films that are difficult sometimes reach a wider audience on video than in theaters. Alejandro González Iñárritu's ''21 Grams,'' released today by Universal, not only deals with a grim subject (the aftermath of a fatal auto accident) but also is set up in a way that requires effort by the viewer to plumb motives and sort out the characters, played by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.</p>
        <p>Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay moves out far along the story line and then backs up, letting the disjointed pieces gradually come together with intriguing chinks here and there. Mr. Iñárritu doesn't mind you jumping to wrong conclusions, because that's the way the world works. Here he achieves depths of intimacy, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''so rarely touched by filmmakers that '21 Grams' is tantamount to the discovery of a new country.''</p>

        <p>Films that are difficult sometimes reach a wider audience on video than in theaters. Alejandro González Iñárritu's ''21 Grams,'' released today by Universal, not only deals with a grim subject (the aftermath of a fatal auto accident) but also is set up in a way that requires effort by the viewer to plumb motives and sort out the characters, played by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg.</p>
        <p>Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay moves out far along the story line and then backs up, letting the disjointed pieces gradually come together with intriguing chinks here and there. Mr. Iñárritu doesn't mind you jumping to wrong conclusions, because that's the way the world works. Here he achieves depths of intimacy, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''so rarely touched by filmmakers that '21 Grams' is tantamount to the discovery of a new country.''</p>
        <p>In this kind of situation more than one DVD viewer has been known to pause to contemplate or even back up a bit. Extras won't help; there aren't any. 2003. $26.98. 125 minutes. R.</p>
        <p>'The Ten Commandments'</p>
        <p>In a six-part documentary about the making of this Cecil B. DeMille epic, released in 1956 and again last week in a two-disc edition by Paramount, it's agreed that he had one instinct shared by all great directors: hire good people and leave them alone. ''If you can't make a career out of two DeMille pictures, you're in the wrong business,'' says Charlton Heston, who played Moses and worked for DeMille four years earlier in ''The Greatest Show on Earth.''</p>
        <p>DeMille films got progressively bigger late in his career. This one required 60,000 extras for one scene. An exhaustive commentary is delivered by Katherine Orrison, who worked seven years on a book about the film. Spend that amount of time with a movie, and you can point out things like the safety pin that shouldn't have been on the diapers of the baby Moses afloat in the bulrushes. (Many letters about that, she says.)</p>
        <p>The baby was Mr. Heston's own infant son. DeMille first wanted William Boyd as Moses. But Boyd preferred cultivating his image as Hopalong Cassidy, who was to become very big with baby boomers on television. $19.99. 220 minutes. G.</p>
        <p>'Scenes From a Marriage'</p>
        <p>Ingmar Bergman originally made this film for television. ''I wrote it very quickly for the fun of it,'' he says in an interview with a three-disc Criterion edition released today. It includes both the television version at five hours and the movie (1973) at 163 minutes.</p>
        <p>After a 10-year marriage, Marianne (Liv Ullmann), a Swedish lawyer, and Johan (Erland Josephson), a professor, separate and move on to other partners yet remain tied emotionally. In The Times, Vincent Canby called the movie ''the molecular structure of a human relationship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergman's wife thought the story was much too private and people wouldn't be interested. But ''everyone seemed to see themselves in it in one way or another, not in Sweden but elsewhere,'' Mr. Bergman says.</p>
        <p>On the third disc the film scholar Peter Cowie compares the television and movie versions. Mr. Bergman, he says, wanted to prove that he could be as good on the small screen as he was on the large. Theater owners wanted the series made into a movie because television was unlikely to show the series with subtitles.</p>
        <p>Tightening for the big screen, Mr. Bergman focused on the couple, cutting all extraneous characters, including their parents and children. As Mr. Cowie points out, the television version has the time to be much more expansive, helping the characters, especially Marianne, to change and grow in richer ways.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ullmann talks extensively. Bergman characters, she says, ''undress the soul.'' $49.95. Swedish with English subtitles.</p>
        <p>'The Commitments'</p>
        <p>''Most bands are only three or four people, mostly male, so I thought a soul band would be more interesting, with a brass section, female vocalists,'' says the writer Roddy Doyle on an expanded two-disc edition of Alan Parker's film released today by Fox.</p>
        <p>Soul wasn't the likeliest sound in working-class Dublin, where a pickup group of 10 musicians comes together to enjoy a measure of recognition. For young people with bleak prospects, there were three escapes: boxing, soccer and music. In a commentary Mr. Parker says he found enough talent among the rock groups around Dublin. He looked for musicianship first and acting experience second, and a vibrant cast of unknowns holds up on both counts.</p>
        <p>A short documentary goes behind the scenes in 1990 when the movie was made, and a longer one revisits actors and filmmakers now, which adds perspective. Mr. Doyle wrote the novel that he, Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement adapted for the film. The producer Lynda Myles says that Mr. Doyle insisted on writing the screenplay himself, so he was given a chance. After his first 24 pages were cut to 8, he agreed that he needed help. 1991. $26.98. 120 minutes. R.</p>
