        <p>On ''The Stones,'' a sitcom that starts tonight on CBS, Winston and Karly Stone (Jay Baruchel, Lindsay Sloane) give their parents an audiovisual presentation on why they should not get divorced. Along with family photos from happier times Winston and Karly, who are adults, offer statistics about the positive effect of marriage on the immune system. The senior Stones, Barbara (Judith Light) and Stan (Robert Klein), are unmoved. They can't stand each other in an old-fashioned way that predates today's immune concerns.</p>
        <p>Or so we're supposed to believe, more or less. After all Barbara and Stan bicker, denouncing each other in no uncertain terms. (She's a nag; he's sarcastic.) But the Stones' way of divorce is so charming and idiosyncratic that they can't go through it without coming closer. And while in transition they decide to keep sharing a house -- Stan lives above the garage -- with their children. Winston's a cute bumbler. Karly's a sexy slacker. Did such situations even exist before sitcoms?</p>

        <p>On ''The Stones,'' a sitcom that starts tonight on CBS, Winston and Karly Stone (Jay Baruchel, Lindsay Sloane) give their parents an audiovisual presentation on why they should not get divorced. Along with family photos from happier times Winston and Karly, who are adults, offer statistics about the positive effect of marriage on the immune system. The senior Stones, Barbara (Judith Light) and Stan (Robert Klein), are unmoved. They can't stand each other in an old-fashioned way that predates today's immune concerns.</p>
        <p>Or so we're supposed to believe, more or less. After all Barbara and Stan bicker, denouncing each other in no uncertain terms. (She's a nag; he's sarcastic.) But the Stones' way of divorce is so charming and idiosyncratic that they can't go through it without coming closer. And while in transition they decide to keep sharing a house -- Stan lives above the garage -- with their children. Winston's a cute bumbler. Karly's a sexy slacker. Did such situations even exist before sitcoms?</p>
        <p>After the premise is established pre-credits, the laughs ought to keep coming, and certainly the show's barking laugh track sounds ready to roll. But ''The Stones'' ultimately misses the potential in the clash of idioms it establishes; most of tonight's jokes are too good-natured. What is incipiently funny in the rapport between Ms. Light and Mr. Klein is their shared facility for jaded, Carson-era humor about alimony, happiness being a dry martini and so forth. They occasionally play that off against the earnestness of their children who, in their early 20's, missed the heyday of divorce jokes.</p>
        <p>Certainly Ms. Light, who is excellent as always, and Mr. Klein, who, though muted, is appealing, could make this work, and if the show finds its rhythm, they will deserve the credit. Alas, for now, CBS may be trying to court young viewers, dressing Barbara (by the second episode) in the same jeans as Karly, and attending far too closely to the love lives of the kids. These subplots are uninventive filler that can serve only to hedge the show's bet that a comedy team of a certain age can succeed in prime time.</p>
        <p>So Winston clumsily tries to woo a scientist at a lab where he works, and Karly goes from one bad boyfriend to the next. Winston, in an annoying voice, delivers nerdy lines, the kind with elaborate scientific terms, which are expected to be funny. Karly flicks off lifeless comebacks of the ''No, Mother, I'm doing heroin'' variety.</p>
        <p>By the time Barbara gives Stan a gift, saying, ''Happy divorce,'' and Stan says world-wearily, ''Oh, Barbara, divorce was gift enough,'' it's clear that the lines of an amusing divorce have been obscured by far too much attention to the sincere needs of the children.</p>
        <p>THE STONES</p>
        <p>CBS, tonight at 9:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 8:30, Central time  Jenji Kohan, David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, executive producers. Directed by James Burrows; story by Ms. Kohan. Produced by Warner Brothers Television in association with KoMut Entertainment.</p>
        <p>WITH: Judith Light (Barbara), Robert Klein (Stan), Lindsay Sloane (Karly) and Jay Baruchel (Winston).</p>
