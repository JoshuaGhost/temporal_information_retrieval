        <p>MAGRO--Frank J., born in Valetta, Malta on June 21st, 1924 and a resident of NYC since 1929, passed away Sunday, March 14th. Died peacefully at home with his family. He will be mourned by his wife Patricia, son Christopher, sister Mary Litris, brother Joe Magro, the balance of his large and incredibly close family and numerous friends who gave meaning to his life. After growing up in Yorkville in the 30's, he was honorably decorated as a combat soldier in Europe during WWII. He went on to an award-winning career as a commercial illustrator and fine artist. All who were exposed to the genius and beauty of his creative talent, the multi-faceted, infinite knowledge which he imparted with joy, and the limitless warmth of his heart were enriched by the experience of knowing him. Family will receive friends on Wednesday, 5-9 PM, at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave. at 81st St. Funeral Mass Thursday, 10 AM, at St. Ignatius Loyola. Entombment to follow at Trinity Cemetery.</p>
