        <p>THE University of Connecticut is a two-time defending national champion, but the Huskies were not given a No. 1 seeding in the tournament. They will, however, receive a home-court edge of sorts throughout the East Regional because they can reach the Final Four without leaving their home state.</p>
        <p>UConn (25-4) missed out on a top seeding for just the second time since it won the first of four national titles in 1995. Seeded No. 2 in the East, the Huskies will begin tournament play next Sunday, facing Penn (17-10), the Ivy League champion, in Bridgeport.</p>

        <p>THE University of Connecticut is a two-time defending national champion, but the Huskies were not given a No. 1 seeding in the tournament. They will, however, receive a home-court edge of sorts throughout the East Regional because they can reach the Final Four without leaving their home state.</p>
        <p>UConn (25-4) missed out on a top seeding for just the second time since it won the first of four national titles in 1995. Seeded No. 2 in the East, the Huskies will begin tournament play next Sunday, facing Penn (17-10), the Ivy League champion, in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>If UConn defeats Penn, it will play the winner of the Auburn-North Carolina State matchup next Tuesday in Bridgeport. A potential matchup with third-seeded Houston looms in the East semifinals in Hartford.</p>
        <p>Penn State (25-5) is seeded No. 1 in the East. If the Nittany Lions and the Huskies advance, they will face each other in the East Regional final in Hartford, the site of several UConn games each season.</p>
        <p>The other No. 1 seeded teams are Tennessee (26-3), a six-time national champion, in the Midwest (and the overall No. 1-seeded team); Duke (27-3) in the Mideast; and Texas (28-4) in the West. Page D2.</p>
