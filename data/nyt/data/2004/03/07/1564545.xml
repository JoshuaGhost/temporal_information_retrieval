        <p>AS Al Gore's campaign spokesman in 2000, Doug Hattaway watched as the National Rifle Association successfully painted his candidate as one who would take Americans' guns away. Mr. Gore lost in states like Tennessee and West Virginia, where hunting is popular, and Democrats have been ducking gun control ever since.</p>
        <p>Today, as a consultant to Americans for Gun Safety, a group advocating restrictions on gun ownership, Mr. Hattaway has urged Democrats to embrace the gun issue with ''a moderate rights and responsibilities'' message. ''Silence on guns is not golden,'' Mr. Hattaway says, and when John Kerry arrived in the Senate last week to vote on a gun bill, the advice appeared to be catching on. On the Senate floor, Mr. Kerry declared his support for extending the assault weapons ban and requiring background checks on gun owners. ''I believe in the right to bear arms,'' he said. But, he added, ''I also believe that with our rights come fundamental, common-sense responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>What followed came as a surprise. The Senate, defying the N.R.A., voted for the weapons ban and background checks, tacking them onto a bill to grant gun makers immunity from civil lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Then the rifle association, having lost on those measures, withdrew its support for the immunity bill. The Senate promptly killed it -- a powerful demonstration of the N.R.A.'s strength. Even so, the political landscape had clearly shifted.</p>
        <p>Gun control, like abortion, fires up conservatives and liberals, but a middle ground was also reflected in last week's vote. Police chiefs and sheriffs lobbied for the assault weapons ban, which has broad public support. The Democratic pollster Mark Penn, who also consults for Americans for Gun Safety, found that 66 percent of gun owners support renewing the weapons ban, which expires in September.</p>
        <p>The issue also resonates with swing voters. As a Republican pollster, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ''Soccer moms aren't sitting there saying, 'We need to allow assault weapons.'''</p>
        <p>That is why a growing number of Republicans, including President Bush, back the assault weapons ban and background checks, making it easier for Democrats like Mr. Kerry to speak out.</p>
        <p>But both parties need to be careful. During the 2000 primary campaign, Mr. Gore and Bill Bradley fought over who had the stronger gun control plans, with Mr. Gore going so far as to call for licensing and registration of handguns. That is anathema to gun owners. In an electorate where, according to Americans for Gun Safety, 47 percent of households and 54 percent of union households -- a core Democratic constituency -- own guns, the Mr. Gore's stand came back to hurt him in the general election.</p>
        <p>The head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, says Democrats have learned where to draw the line: the assault weapons ban and background checks are fine; handgun registration is not.</p>
        <p>President Bush is also in a tricky spot. During his 2000 campaign, the president broke with the N.R.A. to support the assault weapons ban and background checks. The White House says Mr. Bush still supports the measures, but last week he called for the Senate to vote against them on the grounds that the immunity bill -- one of the rifle association's top legislative priorities -- should be approved without amendment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry's spokesman, David Wade, argues that the strategy backfired. ''When he wanted to be known as a compassionate conservative in 2000, he said, 'Hey, I'm not like these other Republicans, I'm for an assault weapons ban.' It's an awfully uncomfortable predicament that the White House is in, explaining why they are pandering to the N.R.A. instead of keeping their promise.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Charlie Black, a Republican consultant, says Mr. Kerry made a mistake by speaking out. ''If I were Kerry, I would have laid low,'' he said. ''He needs to go get some votes from conservative Democrats and rural people if he's going to win the election, and some of them might be offended by this.''</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association is certainly not going to endorse Mr. Kerry. After the Senate approved the weapons ban and gun show background checks last week, the association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, e-mailed lawmakers, urging them to kill the immunity bill and reminding them that their votes would count ''in our future evaluations and endorsements of candidates.'' ''We believe in what we're doing,'' Mr. LaPierre said later, ''and we never go away.''</p>
