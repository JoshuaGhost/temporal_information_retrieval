        <p>The northwestern part of V.E. Macy Park in Irvington was renamed the Great Hunger Memorial Park in a dedication ceremony on Wednesday. The renaming brought to a close a sometimes bumpy 10-year-long effort in Westchester County to commemorate the suffering and courage of the Irish people during the potato famine of the mid-19th century. Among the dignitaries at the dedication was Eugene Hutchinson, Ireland's consul general to the United States. The Great Hunger Memorial of Westchester County is a stone-and-bronze sculpture, created by the Irish artist Eamonn O'Doherty, that depicts a family walking away from symbols of the past toward an unknowable future.</p>
