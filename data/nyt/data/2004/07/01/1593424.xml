        <p>JOE NAHEM is known for taking pedigreed 20th-century French designs by, say, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann or Jean Royère and mixing them with anonymous pieces, but for his own house he did not go for big names. Instead, he gave cheap furniture a twist with high-end upholstery.</p>

        <p>Cushions on a daybed, right, are upholstered in a moss-pistachio Row Stripe acrylic canvas weave from Perennials; $49 a yard to the trade; (888) 322-4773, www.perennialsfabric.com. Larsen provided Botanicus cotton ($102 a yard) for a pair of armless chairs in the living room; to the trade from Cowtan &amp; Tout, (212) 647-6900. Driftwood stools were dressed in sky-blue cowhide from Edelman leather, $14 a square foot; to the trade, (800) 886-8339. White vinyl for a sofa came from Naugahyde; $8.25 a yard. And Mr. Nahem came to love the pale blue welted two-tone upholstery on a pair of Deco chairs that came with the house. Sometimes you stick with what you have.</p>
