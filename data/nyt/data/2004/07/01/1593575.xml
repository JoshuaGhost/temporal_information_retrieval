        <p>W. John Brennan resigned as chief judge of the Albuquerque district, the state's largest trial circuit, one month after he was charged with possession of cocaine and driving while intoxicated. In papers filed with the New Mexico Supreme Court, Judge Brennan's lawyers argued that he should be allowed to retire rather than face the disciplinary proceedings of a state judicial panel, which could reduce or eliminate his pension. The court scheduled a hearing on the question for July 14. Judge Brennan, 57, is undergoing substance abuse treatment in California, his lawyer said.</p>
