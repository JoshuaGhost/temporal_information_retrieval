        <p>Less than a week after pulling its last remaining forces from the American-led mission in Iraq, Spain's new Socialist government announced Friday that it had approved doubling the number of Spanish troops assigned to the NATO mission in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The increase would take the total number of Spanish soldiers to the mission to nearly 1,000, the Defense Ministry said.</p>
        <p>Spain now has about 150 soldiers in Afghanistan, a defense official said. An additional 300 are in the region and involved in the mission, according to a Foreign Ministry official.</p>
        <p>Members of the opposition Popular Party have accused Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and his Socialist Party of a double standard in deciding to send troops abroad shortly after withdrawing them from Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapatero was elected three days after the March 11 train bombings in Madrid that killed 191 people. He campaigned largely on a pledge to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq.</p>
        <p>His government says there is a clear distinction between the mission in Iraq, which it describes as a unilateral action taken by the United States, and the one in Afghanistan, which it says was approved by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The new Spanish deployment would include peacekeeping troops, as well as medical and transportation forces.</p>
        <p>A Foreign Ministry official said 400 to 500 of the troops would probably return to Spain after the Afghan elections later this year.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Zapatero said he would appear before Parliament, probably on Tuesday, to explain his plan and submit it for a vote. He is also expected to discuss a plan to send about 100 soldiers to join a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti, which has been in turmoil since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was forced from power in late February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zapatero does not need legislative approval to send troops abroad, but one of his advisers said the prime minister would reconsider his position if Parliament voted against him.</p>
