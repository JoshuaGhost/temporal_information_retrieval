        <p>New Jersey residents have weathered such a torrent of corruption investigations in recent years that, by now, the life cycle of the state's political scandals is as predictable as the changing of the seasons.</p>
        <p>First come the accusations, usually in the form of a federal indictment. Next come outraged denials from the accused. Step 3 is the rallying of the troops, when allies step forward to defend his honor. Then comes the wait, to learn whether the charges are substantiated.</p>
        <p>But in the past two weeks, as Governor McGreevey's administration has been rattled by two fund-raising scandals, the people involved have departed from the customary script in several fascinating ways.</p>
        <p>The most important is the fact that the governor has not been accused of wrongdoing. The United States attorney indicted one of the governor's fund-raisers, accusing him of offering government favors in exchange for campaign cash, and charged another of his patrons with obstruction of justice for allegedly hiring prostitutes to silence witnesses.</p>
        <p>While the cases raise serious questions about the governor's choice of friends, there is no suggestion that Mr. McGreevey personally violated any legal or ethical standards, and the governor insists that the facts will vindicate the administration.</p>
        <p>Despite those assertions, Mr. McGreevey's fellow Democrats have hardly been stampeding to offer the governor public support.</p>
        <p>Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, the state Democratic chairwoman, angrily suggested that United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie -- a potential Republican candidate for governor next year -- is trying to unfairly smear Mr. McGreevey to gain a partisan advantage. And the Senate president, Richard J. Codey, called the scandals unfortunate and reminded the public not to panic.</p>
        <p>The Democratic leaders of the Assembly wrote a letter to caucus members about the furor: it mentioned Governor McGreevey once, then embarked into a two-page diatribe railing against the Republicans who ruled Trenton for a decade.</p>
        <p>Beyond those measured statements, there have been few Democrats willing to stand up and deliver a rousing defense of Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>''It's been such a pattern of poor judgment, particularly with his political associations and appointments, that after a while, people become hesitant to put their own credibility on the line,'' said Joseph R. Marbach, chairman of the political science department at Seton Hall University.</p>
        <p>The most interesting character to watch amid the turmoil was Senator Jon. S. Corzine, whom many Democrats would like to see replace Mr. McGreevey as the party's nominee for governor next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine had his own ties to Charles Kushner, the fund-raiser accused of hiring the prostitutes: he had accepted thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Mr. Kushner and earlier this year, the two men even made an unsuccessful bid to purchase the New Jersey Nets. So Mr. Corzine quickly moved to distance himself from Mr. Kushner, by returning his campaign contributions. Then he went to the governor's aid by announcing that he had no intention of challenging him.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Corzine's public support of Mr. McGreevey is lukewarm compared with the impassioned speeches he made two years ago, when Senator Robert G. Torricelli was accused of misusing his office to aid a businessman who had given him expensive gifts. Mr. Corzine's reward for that loyalty was embarrassment, when the Senate ethics committee admonished Mr. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine's aides say he will continue to stand behind Mr. McGreevey (and they point out that he was especially vehement in defending Mr. Torricelli because the two men were extremely close friends).</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey and his allies insist they are pleased with the way Democrats have come to his aid. Steve DeMicco, a Democratic strategist, said that he is confident that voters are more concerned with property tax rates and the quality of schools than the inner workings of the campaign finance system.</p>
        <p>''Politicians aren't in the habit of defending other politicians,'' Mr. DeMicco said. ''Once we enter the election season this will all be washed away.''</p>
        <p>But Republicans have already begun broadcasting ads lamenting the various ethical questions surrounding the administration.</p>
        <p>Privately, some Democratic lawmakers worry that the investigations may hurt their prospects this fall if they produce more damaging revelations in the coming months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey is not concerned. He said he never asked fellow Democrats to speak on his behalf because he is confident that the public will ultimately recognize that his administration acted ethically.</p>
        <p>''Where I did ask for support from Jon Corzine and Frank Lautenberg was on the bill to preserve the Highlands, and on domestic partnership and on stem cell research,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''I want to stick to government. Stick to the issues. Focus on making people's lives better. Because that's what really matters.''</p>
