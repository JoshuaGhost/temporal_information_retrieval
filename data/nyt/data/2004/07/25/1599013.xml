        <p>Because it sometimes arrives late and often leaves early, summer is adored in Chicago as in few other cities. Everything moves outdoors -- onto back porches, into neighborhood parks, onto restaurant patios.</p>
        <p>And especially to the edge of Lake Michigan, along the favorite ribbon of beaches and paths that hems the city. Boats fill the harbors. Softball teams pack the stretch of diamonds along the edge of downtown. The city even shows free movies outside. Chicago lavishes attention on Venetian Night, July 31, when decorated boats parade up the lakefront from the campus of the city's museums to Monroe Harbor, and people sit outside to watch.</p>

        <p>During summertime in Chicago, the action moves outdoors, to neighborhood parks, the shoreline and now, the recently completed Millennium Park.</p>

        <p>Because it sometimes arrives late and often leaves early, summer is adored in Chicago as in few other cities. Everything moves outdoors -- onto back porches, into neighborhood parks, onto restaurant patios.</p>
        <p>And especially to the edge of Lake Michigan, along the favorite ribbon of beaches and paths that hems the city. Boats fill the harbors. Softball teams pack the stretch of diamonds along the edge of downtown. The city even shows free movies outside. Chicago lavishes attention on Venetian Night, July 31, when decorated boats parade up the lakefront from the campus of the city's museums to Monroe Harbor, and people sit outside to watch.</p>
        <p>This month, at last, Mayor Richard M. Daley held a grand opening for one of his favorite projects, Millennium Park, an outdoor architectural and artistic extravaganza in the city's heart, between the skyscrapers of the Loop and the lake. Though some have complained about how long it took to complete the park and about its cost ($475 million), it is undeniably ambitious. This is no big green lawn. Something hits the senses in every direction: a performance art center, fountains, a promenade, sculptures, a restaurant, an outdoor music pavilion with the touches of Frank Gehry.</p>
        <p>And so, Chicagoans have found another reason to go outside.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>Inside at the Art Institute of Chicago, 111 South Michigan Avenue, a new exhibition examines one of the museum's most famous works, ''A Sunday on the Grande Jatte,'' to show what led Georges Seurat to create it and how it ultimately affected the art world. ''Seurat and the Making of 'La Grande Jatte,''' runs through Sept. 19. The exhibition looks at his earlier works, as well as those of Monet, Renoir, Pissarro and Signac. Timed and dated tickets are required, and are available at (312) 930-4040, or www.artic.edu/aic. Tickets are $12 Monday through Thursday, $15 Friday through Sunday. Weekday hours are 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Thursday until 8 p.m.); weekends, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>On Tuesdays through Aug. 24, movies are shown on a 50-by-34-foot screen in Butler Field, at Lake Shore Drive and Monroe Street, as part of the Chicago Outdoor Film Festival. The schedule includes ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' ''Roman Holiday'' and ''Guys and Dolls.'' Showtimes are between 8 and 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>Chefs from Chicago and around the Midwest give demonstrations this summer in the outdoor kitchen amphitheater of the Chicago Botanic Garden, 25 miles north of downtown. They will show people how to prepare meals from their own gardens, as well as answering such basic questions as, what does one do with Swiss chard anyway? The demonstrations, at 1:30 and 2:30 p.m. on weekends, run until Oct. 10. Admission is free; parking is $10. The lavish gardens at 1000 Lake Cook Road, Glencoe, Ill., are open daily, 8 a.m. to sunset; (847) 835-5440, on the Web at www.chicagobotanic.org. Buses to Metra commuter trains are available; contact the Regional Transportation Authority, (312) 836-7000 or on the Web at www.rtachicago.com.</p>
        <p>On the city's South Side, in the Hyde Park neighborhood around the University of Chicago, carillon performances (a ''Carillonathon'') are being presented all summer in the late Gothic revival Rockefeller Memorial Chapel, 5850 South Woodlawn Avenue. The university's carillonneur, Wylie Crawford, and guest artists from around the country and Europe perform free on Sunday at 6 p.m. until Aug. 22. The music will range from classical to pop to show tunes -- anything that can be played on 72 bells. Call (773) 702-2100 or (773) 702-7059.</p>
        <p>Three clowns perform Shakespeare in their own avant-garde, improvisational way, in ''500 Clown Macbeth,'' at the Lookingglass Theater, 821 North Michigan Avenue, (312) 337-0665 or on the Web at www.lookingglasstheatre.org. The show is set to open Wednesday, and runs to Aug. 29. Performances are Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Friday at 1 and 8 p.m.; Saturday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Most tickets are $25.</p>
        <p>The Mexican gray wolf, long threatened, is on display this summer at the Brookfield Zoo, 31st Street and First Avenue in Brookfield, Ill., 14 miles west of downtown Chicago; (708) 485-2200, on the Web at www.brookfieldzoo.org. Admission, $8; parking, $8. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. this summer. From downtown, take Metra's Burlington Northern train to the zoo stop.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Wandering Chicago in summer may be best undertaken without an agenda: follow the path beside the lake, and see the city's architecture from every direction. Walk north until you arrive at Fullerton Parkway, head west into Lincoln Park and find the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, a short walk from the lake at 2430 North Cannon Drive, (773) 755-5100 or www.chias.org. Here, you can learn about the Midwestern prairie, butterflies and wildflowers. Open 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. General admission, $7; free on Thursdays.</p>
        <p>For a less crowded path, walk south, past a reinvented Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears, and on toward the city's skateboard park, at 31st Street, which draws gravity-defying teens from all over the area.</p>
        <p>On the city's West Side, too often overlooked by tourists, the Garfield Park Conservatory, 300 North Central Park Avenue, (312) 746-5100, www.garfieldconservatory.org, is well worth a visit for a lush array of plants. A new exhibition, ''Giants: African Dinosaurs at the Garfield Park Conservatory, created by Project Exploration,'' on the Web at www.dinogiants.org, has brought massive African dinosaur skeletons into the conservatory's plant-filled rooms; through Sept. 6. A donation of $3 is suggested. The el train's Green Line will take you from the Loop in 10 minutes. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily (Thursday until 8 p.m.).</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>In the heart of the theater district, a playful musical theme fills the lobby of the Allegro Chicago, 171 West Randolph Street; (800) 643-1500, fax (312) 236-0917, online at www.allegrochicago.com. The 483 Art Deco rooms contain touches of zebra prints and pink, and feature CD players. Guests can enjoy a free wine hour daily. Pets are allowed. Double rooms from $139 to $279.</p>
        <p>For a view of the Chicago River, consider Hotel 71, at 71 East Wacker Drive; (800) 621-4005, fax (312) 346-1721, www.hotel71.com. The 454 rooms are done in a minimalist style and are decorated with photos of some of Chicago's landmarks, like Buckingham Fountain and Water Tower Place. Doubles from $129 to $329.</p>
        <p>Budget: The 130-room Comfort Inn and Suites Downtown, 15 East Ohio Street, (888) 775-4111, fax (312) 894-0999, on the Web at www.chicagocomfortinn.com, sits along a hectic and touristy street, but inside, it is peaceful and attractive. Doubles start around $119 and go up to $249 for a suite.</p>
        <p>If price and location matter most, the Best Western Inn of Chicago, 162 East Ohio Street, (800) 557-2378, www.innofchicago.com, may suit: It is the shortest of walks from the Magnificent Mile, the glittering strip of stores along North Michigan Avenue where you can quickly spend all the money you have saved at the hotel. The 357 rooms are often small and forgettable, but clean; rates range from $99 to $139.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Drake Hotel, 140 East Walton Place, (800) 553-7253, fax (312) 787-1431, on the Web at www.thedrakehotel.com, is a Chicago institution beside Lake Michigan.</p>
        <p>The 537 classic rooms, some of which look out on the lake, are decorated in regal tones, with dark wood and brass. Afternoon tea is served daily. Double deluxe rooms, with two queen beds and two bathrooms, are $209 to $489.</p>
        <p>In the center of downtown, The old Carbide and Carbon Building, built in the 1920's, has become the Hard Rock Hotel, 230 North Michigan Avenue; (312) 345-1000, fax (312) 345-1012.</p>
        <p>The 381-room hotel subtly reflects the rock 'n' roll theme: embroidered guitars appears on the edges of pillowcases, prints of the Beatles show up on otherwise spare walls. The modern, sleek rooms come in shades of taupe and chocolate and have CD players, DVD players and free high-speed Internet access. Standard double rooms, $179 to $239.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Mirai Sushi, 2020 West Division Street, (773) 862-8500, is in Wicker Park, on one of the city's fastest-growing stretches of boutiques, funky shops and restaurants. The tuna-tuna-salmon plate is rich and succulent. For those who don't care for raw bluefin tuna or salt water eel, there are excellent cooked options too: baked king crab in a spicy sauce and steaming buns filled with pork and mushrooms. Dinner for two can cost $85 or more. Open Sunday through Wednesday from 5 to 10:30 p.m. and Thursday through Saturday 5 to 11:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Wallace's Catfish Corner, 2800 West Madison Street at California Avenue, (773) 638-3474, sits due west of the Loop, not far from the United Center where the Bulls and Blackhawks play. The atmosphere is loud and hectic but the fried catfish here is fresh, as is the okra, and not too greasy. Other specialties include fried shrimp and barbecued rib sandwiches. You may even spot Wallace Davis Jr., a former Chicago alderman, behind the counter. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. A meal for two will cost less than $20.</p>
        <p>In the River North neighborhood (just north of the Chicago River), chef Kevin Shikami dreams up delicious French-Asian pairings at Kevin, 9 West Hubbard Street, (312) 595-0055. The combinations -- a soup of asparagus with goat cheese, shiitake, chives and truffle oil; a roasted wild striped bass in a bed of artichokes, pancetta and morel mushrooms -- are delicate and surprising. Dark woods make the room feel intimate. Lunch weekdays, dinner nightly except Sunday. A full dinner for two with drinks can cost well over $100.</p>
        <p>The Uptown neighborhood on the city's North Side may not have a choice of upscale restaurants, but Magnolia Cafe, 1224 West Wilson Avenue, (773) 728-8785, offers an elegant option. American cuisine, dressed up beautifully and carefully presented, includes mushroom ravioli, pork tenderloin and seared salmon. Dinner nightly except Monday. Sunday brunch, too. Dinner for two with drinks: about $75.</p>
        <p>In the Ukrainian Village neighborhood, A Tavola, 2148 West Chicago Avenue, (773) 276-7567, is easy to drive past. It looks more like a house, and it feels that way inside, with a few tables in the dining room and attentive hosts. The chef creates simple but well-prepared Italian fare: a simple salad of greens topped with pears; a roast chicken beside a creamy polenta and a beef tenderloin filet, gnocchi in browned sage butter. Dinner for two, with wine and dessert, can cost $85. Dinner nightly except Sunday.</p>
