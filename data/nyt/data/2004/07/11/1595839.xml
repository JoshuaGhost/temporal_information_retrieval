        <p>For a while now, the word among those who frequent Indian restaurants has been that the thrill is gone: there are only so many ways to fill a samosa.</p>
        <p>But that is not the case at Chowpatty, in Jersey City and Iselin, which lures patrons with old-fashioned, unadorned South Indian food. The place itself is named for a beach in Mumbai, where food (fast and easy -- like that of Chowpatty) is sold in small stalls along a boardwalk.</p>

        <p>For a while now, the word among those who frequent Indian restaurants has been that the thrill is gone: there are only so many ways to fill a samosa.</p>
        <p>But that is not the case at Chowpatty, in Jersey City and Iselin, which lures patrons with old-fashioned, unadorned South Indian food. The place itself is named for a beach in Mumbai, where food (fast and easy -- like that of Chowpatty) is sold in small stalls along a boardwalk.</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is why the owners, Chandrakant Patel and his family, put the emphasis on the food rather than the d√©cor. Three paces in, patrons find themselves facing a high wall of clear plastic cubes stocking boxes of salty and sweet snacks with names like tum tum and nylon sev ($4 and $5 a pound). There is a rear dining area that doesn't have much on McDonald's, save the Indian music being piped in.</p>
        <p>Diners unfamiliar with South Indian dishes should not expect to be coddled by the wait staff, who are not the type to steer you toward a mild curry dish. The idea here is to interrupt the two men chatting behind the counter and point to something on the largely untranslated menu.</p>
        <p>The experienced and the lucky pick one of three thalis, or combination platters. The most basic, the Chowpatty Thali, costs $11.99 and includes six pooris (fried, dumpling-like appetizers of puffy bread), a vegetable like okra or mashed eggplant and a confusing choice of ''farsan, rice, dal or kadhi, papad, pickle.'' It is best just to signal that whatever they give you is fine. It is all delicious anyway, gently spiced and generously portioned.</p>
        <p>On departing, it is worth it to interrupt the chatty counter guys once more to try a colorful rolled sweet. The barfi ($5.50), a combination of chocolate, pistachio and almond pastes, is unfortunately named, but try it anyway. It ends a humbling adventure on a sweet note.</p>
        <p>Tammy La Gorce</p>
        <p>Chowpatty, 1349 Oak Tree Road, Iselin, (732)283-9020, and 809 Newark Avenue, Jersey City, (201)222-1818. Open Tuesday through Sunday: 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. in Iselin, 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. in Jersey City.</p>
