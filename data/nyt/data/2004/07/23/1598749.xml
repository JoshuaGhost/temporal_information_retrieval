        <p>The House of Representatives joined the fight over gay marriage on Thursday, approving legislation that would prohibit federal courts from overturning parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.</p>
        <p>Republican backers of the legislation, which was adopted on a mainly party-line vote of 233 to 194, said it was needed to prevent federal judges from invalidating the part of the 1996 law that says states cannot be forced to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>''The policy before us today would reaffirm the current national consensus on homosexual marriage by leaving to the states and the American people the right to define marriage in this country,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay, a proponent of the bill.</p>
        <p>Democrats said the measure was an unconstitutional outrage that violated the separation of powers and would deny a group of Americans their right to redress in the courts.</p>
        <p>''Republicans have decided that if you are gay, you should be able to get along with just two branches of government,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The House debate was a prelude to a coming battle over the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages. House leaders are trying to round up votes for the proposal, which was easily rejected last week in the Senate, and they may bring it up for a vote in the fall. The vote Thursday allowed Republicans to air their views on the issue without facing the prospect of losing the amendment fight. But the bill is unlikely to be considered in the Senate this year.</p>
        <p>The White House supports the measure and in a policy statement renewed its call for Congress to adopt a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage.</p>
        <p>Republicans said they wanted to act before the Defense of Marriage Act, which was challenged this week in a Florida court, is overturned. And they rejected the argument that the measure was effectively shutting the courthouse door on those who would seek to contest the law.</p>
        <p>''It is the state courthouse they will go to, not the federal courthouse,'' said Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He and other Republicans said the measure simply put the recognition of marriage in the state legal arena, where it has traditionally been. They said Democrats who opposed the amendment on the ground that the definition of marriage should be left to the states should support the bill's approach.</p>
        <p>Democrats heatedly challenged the premise of the bill, saying Congress had never before taken such a drastic move to strip federal courts of authority. They said the proposal undermined the Constitution.</p>
        <p>''If this bill becomes law, it will represent the first time in our history that Congress has enacted legislation that completely bars any federal court, including the United States Supreme Court, from considering the constitutionality of federal legislation,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No.2 Democrat in the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoyer and others warned that the bill could establish a dangerous precedent and said that if such an approach had been used in the past, federal courts would not have been able to rule on cases that helped end government-sanctioned racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>''What would have happened had Congress decided during the civil rights battles of the 1960's that we should just take away the decisions from the courts?'' asked Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.</p>
        <p>Republicans dismissed the Democratic claims as exaggerated and said Congress often limited federal court jurisdiction on policy issues. They said the need to protect traditional marriage from the spread of same-sex marriage made the law necessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay said marriage was more than a ''contract of mutual affection between two consenting adults.'' He added, ''It is instead the architecture of families, the basic unit of civilization and the natural means by which the human species creates, protects and instills values in its children.''</p>
        <p>Democrats have accused Republicans of raising the marriage issue in both the House and Senate to create a cultural issue for this November's elections, since neither the amendment nor the bill approved Thursday has much chance of being enacted.</p>
        <p>Civil liberties and gay rights groups assailed the vote, calling it a politically motivated effort to appease social conservatives. ''Today's attack on the constitutional system of checks and balances demonstrates the corrosive impact of election-year politics as practiced by the religious right and its political allies,'' said Ralph G. Neas, president of the liberal group People for the American Way.</p>
        <p>But conservative groups said the House had taken a needed step. ''The House has done its part today to build a wall of defense around the institution of marriage,'' said Michael Schwartz, vice president for government relations of Concerned Women for America.</p>
