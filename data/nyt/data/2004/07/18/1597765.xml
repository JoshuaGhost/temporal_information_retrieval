        <p>Suffolk County Comptroller Joseph Sawicki releases audit showing that Michael Hollander was reimbursed $11,235 for expenses and charged $74,444 on bureau credit card while serving as president of Long Island Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau in what it calls undocumented, unreasonable or abusive use of bureau funds (S)</p>

        <p>Michael Hollander, now chairman of Suffolk County Community College's board of trustees, partied heartily with his staff when he was president of the Long Island Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and charged it all to the taxpayers, according to an audit released on Wednesday by the Suffolk County comptroller, Joseph Sawicki.</p>
        <p>Tabs at a Melville strip club, political contributions, meals, parties, gifts, hotel rooms and even a golf bag were added to Mr. Hollander's expense account or charged on the bureau's American Express card, the audit says. In total, Mr. Hollander was reimbursed $11,235 in expenses and charged $74,444 in what the audit calls undocumented, unreasonable or abusive use of bureau funds.</p>

        <p>Michael Hollander, now chairman of Suffolk County Community College's board of trustees, partied heartily with his staff when he was president of the Long Island Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau and charged it all to the taxpayers, according to an audit released on Wednesday by the Suffolk County comptroller, Joseph Sawicki.</p>
        <p>Tabs at a Melville strip club, political contributions, meals, parties, gifts, hotel rooms and even a golf bag were added to Mr. Hollander's expense account or charged on the bureau's American Express card, the audit says. In total, Mr. Hollander was reimbursed $11,235 in expenses and charged $74,444 in what the audit calls undocumented, unreasonable or abusive use of bureau funds.</p>
        <p>The audit also questioned whether tens of thousands of additional dollars, for example amounts spent on New York Islanders and Long Island Ducks season tickets, were truly related to the bureau's mission.</p>
        <p>Robert Clifford, a spokesman for the county district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, confirmed that his office was investigating. The inquiry will look at such expense account items as a plane ticket to Hawaii and lodging at high-priced East End hotels and whether Mr. Hollander disguised political campaign contributions as restaurant expenses, Mr. Clifford said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hollander could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Arthur J. Kremer, criticized Mr. Sawicki for releasing the audit's findings without giving his client a chance to explain the spending.</p>
        <p>''This was a rush to judgment,'' Mr. Kremer said. ''Had he sat down with the man who ran the place for six years, he would have had all the facts.'' Mr. Hollander had previously offered to repay any inappropriate charges, which he figured came to about $150, Mr. Kremer added.</p>
