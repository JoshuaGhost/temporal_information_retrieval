        <p>Four banks, including the local units of Citigroup and HSBC, have agreed to absorb some losses stemming from the banking crisis of the mid-1990's, ending a dispute with regulators, legislators said Thursday.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the banks will absorb about $826 million in bad loans and allow a limited audit of some $600 million in questionable loans, said Senator Fauzi Hamdan and Congressman Manuel Pérez Cárdenas, both from the ruling National Action Party.</p>
        <p>In addition, the banks have agreed to open sealed working papers from a 1998 audit. Legislators believe that those papers may reveal additional questionable loans.</p>
        <p>Press reports estimated that the total loss for the banks could reach $1.5 billion, once loss-sharing provisions and any illegal loans uncovered by the audits are taken into account. The $700 million in bad credits that the banks have agreed to absorb are insider loans, money that the banks lent to board members or to companies controlled by friends.</p>
        <p>Legislators and the government agency that inherited the bad loans have been pressing the banks to allow an audit. But the banks have resisted and tied up the issue in court.</p>
        <p>''Finally, a reasonable, fair and legal attitude prevailed'' among the banks, Mr. Hamdan said. ''It's a fair solution.''</p>
        <p>The four banks involved are Citigroup's Banamex unit; HSBC; Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria's Mexican bank known as BBVA-Bancomer; and a Mexican bank, Banorte. At the time of the banking crisis, all the banks were owned by Mexicans.</p>
        <p>The four banks sold some $6 billion in bad loans under the bailout plan, an amount that has swelled to about $20 billion with interest. Most of the cost of the bailout was a result of bank failures, and the four banks involved in the auditing dispute have long argued that they were unfairly singled out given that they were among the few left standing.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that while the amount involved was not significant to the banks, the agreement eliminated a source of risk to the banking system.</p>
        <p>''We view the agreement as positive for the financial system as a whole,'' wrote Jason Mollin, a Latin America banking analyst for Bear Stearns in New York, in a report Thursday.</p>
        <p>Gustavo López, senior director for Latin America financial institutions at Fitch Ratings in New York, said, ''The agreement would be beneficial because it would avoid a further escalation of this issue.''</p>
        <p>The agreement ends a politically charged element of the government's $100 billion rescue of Mexico's banks after the peso devaluation in December 1994. As interest rates soared to 100 percent, debtors simply stopped paying their loans, leaving the banks with billions of dollars of bad loans. To capitalize the banks, the government stepped in, buying the bad loans in return for bonds.</p>
        <p>But the bonds, called Fobaproa bonds after the executive agency that issued them, were never backed by Congress, which has had to authorize interest payments with each year's budget.</p>
        <p>Legislators, along with the government regulator that inherited the bad loans, have been pressing for an audit. The regulator, called the Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings, has held up the exchange of Fobaproa bonds for new bonds that would not require approval from Congress every year.</p>
        <p>Since almost $17 billion of the Fobaproa notes fall due in 2005, the exchange was becoming urgent for the banks, given the possibility that legislators might decide not to approve some or all of the payments.</p>
        <p>The deal unblocks the bond exchange. Instead, interest payments and amortizations on the new bonds will not need yearly congressional approval.</p>
