        <p>Gov. James E. McGreevey celebrated the Fourth of July at ground zero in Manhattan, and as he helped lay the cornerstone for the Freedom Tower, it appeared that he himself was on the verge of a new beginning.</p>
        <p>He had just won approval of a budget that allowed him to both increase spending and extend popular property tax rebates. His plan to levy a so-called millionaire's tax had received a warm reception from most voters. Mr. McGreevey had even managed to carve out a legacy issue, by convincing the Legislature to preserve 400,000 acres in the Highlands.</p>
        <p>A handful of recent polls showed that the governor's approval ratings were recovering from the series of missteps that have hobbled much of his tenure.</p>
        <p>Then on Tuesday, the first day after the Independence Day holiday, the United States Attorney's Office announced its indictment of the Democratic fund-raiser David D'Amiano, in a case that is likely to bedevil Mr. McGreevey for the rest of his term.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amiano is accused of soliciting $40,000 in campaign contributions from a landowner in exchange for government favors. The indictment revealed that Mr. McGreevey had been secretly taped meeting the two men and uttering a word that the landowner and Mr. D'Amiano had devised as a secret code to refer to their scheme: Machiavelli.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey says he was unaware of any plot and insists that his literary reference was a mere coincidence.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have not accused the governor of any wrongdoing. But as the investigation drags on, and as Mr. McGreevey prepares to seek re-election in November 2005, there is little chance that the issue will fade.</p>
        <p>However the legal case develops, the entire episode is a particularly unwelcome political development for Mr. McGreevey, whose tenure has been marked by a parade of ethical questions involving donors, political operatives, fund-raisers and a handful of administration members.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders have already indicated that they will make ethics a major issue in their effort to unseat Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>On Friday, 16 months before voters will render their judgment on Mr. McGreevey, Douglas R. Forrester, a businessman who unsuccessfully ran for a United States Senate seat in 2002 and a potential candidate for governor, ran a radio ad blasting unnamed ''politicians who abuse the public trust.''</p>
        <p>So far, Democrats have remained mostly silent, with a few party loyalists joining the administration's complaint that New Jersey's United States attorney, Christopher J. Christie, who is often cited as a possible candidate for governor, is using the case as a political club to weaken Mr. McGreevey.</p>
        <p>If new revelations emerge as the election approaches, however, that support could begin to dissolve.</p>
        <p>''This reinforces an image of McGreevey who is a professional operative or a hack politician instead of being a civic statesman,'' said David Rebovich, director of the Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. ''And if his poll numbers drop too much, the Democratic county leaders could get nervous, and all of a sudden he's facing a challenge in the primary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey insists that the facts will show that neither he nor any member of his administration ever acted improperly, and he has pushed prosecutors to release all of the documents and tapes immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christie has refused, saying that he will release the evidence only when it is needed in court, which could be in six months, a year, or never.</p>
        <p>If Mr. D'Amiano reverses himself and decides to cooperate with prosecutors, the investigation will intensify, and the governor will have to worry about whether he makes other damaging accusations about Mr. McGreevey or members of the administration.</p>
        <p>If Mr. D'Amiano decides to stand trial, the case will still present Mr. McGreevey with uncomfortable choices. At this point, the governor is nothing more than a witness in the case, which means he could be asked to testify at trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey's explanation now for his conversations with Mr. D'Amiano and the landowner is essentially that he was duped by Mr. D'Amiano, who was raising money while having extraordinary access to state government -- hardly the type of argument that would win the confidence of voters during a re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>And then there is a potential worst-case scenario, that Mr. McGreevey could somehow become the subject of the ongoing investigation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the governor's office must also worry about an array of other potentially embarrassing scandals, the most serious involving the governor's former chief of staff and chief counsel, who are under criminal investigation concerning whether they used their government positions to inflate the value of their billboard company.</p>
        <p>Even before the D'Amiano case exploded into front-page news, a few disgruntled Democratic leaders were quietly, and unsuccessfully, lobbying fellow party officials to ask Mr. McGreevey to step aside and allow United States Senator Jon S. Corzine to run for governor in 2005.</p>
        <p>None of those party officials are willing to publicly challenge the governor at this point. But if the situation worsens, Mr. McGreevey is ready with a response.</p>
        <p>On the radio station 101.5 FM on Thursday, Mr. McGreevey was asked what he would do if Democratic leaders asked him to let another candidate take the party's gubernatorial nomination next year.</p>
        <p>''I believe in what I do,'' he said. ''I work hard every day. I fight for what I believe in. I would say: 'God bless you. That's what primaries are for.'''</p>
