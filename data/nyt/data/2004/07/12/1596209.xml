      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Carlos Beltran, who was voted to the American League All-Star team, will end up playing for the National League All-Stars after he was named Sunday as the replacement for the injured Ken Griffey Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
        <p>Beltran started the season with the Kansas City Royals and was picked by his peers for the A.L. team.</p>
        <p>Because he was traded to the Houston Astros last month, he could not represent the A.L.; he would have been allowed to participate in the festivities without playing. Now Beltran will have a chance to play.</p>
        <p>Griffey partly tore his right hamstring while pursuing a fly ball in a 5-0 loss at Milwaukee on Saturday. He was scheduled to join Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa in the first All-Star outfield in which each starter had at least 500 career homers.</p>
        <p>Instead, Griffey was placed on the 15-day disabled list; he will miss the All-Star Game because of an injury for the fourth time in his career.</p>
