        <p>Lost in the heap of legislation passed by the City Council last week was a hastily introduced resolution on sidewalk pay phones that drew little public discussion. Known simply as Land Use 207, it was the culmination of months of behind-the-scenes lobbying by the telecommunications industry.</p>
        <p>The one-page resolution, which has not yet been approved by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, sought a slight change in wording to New York City's franchise agreements with the private companies that build and operate public pay phones on city property.</p>
        <p>That change has potentially far-reaching implications, since it requires that future pay phone contracts run for 15 years, which is regarded as a long time in the fast-changing field of telecommunications. The last city pay-phone contract was negotiated in 1999 and runs for 11 years, with an option to extend it for four years.</p>
        <p>A resolution passed by the Council last October allowed the city to issue future contracts for much shorter time periods. Last week's change took away that option, requiring instead that all contracts be for a full 15 years.</p>
        <p>Council leaders acknowledge that the change to a mandatory term of 15 years was requested by telecommunications companies and their lobbyists, who maintained that it would allow the companies more time to recoup their investments, help them get financing from banks, and ensure more competition to get the franchises that will ultimately benefit the city as a whole.</p>
        <p>The city agency that oversees these franchises, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, is vigorously opposing the change. Gino P. Menchini, the commissioner, said that such a requirement would tie his hands in negotiating and force the city into long-term commitments for something that may become obsolete in 15 years.</p>
        <p>''These franchises may outlive the usefulness of the pay phones that are there to serve the public,'' he said. ''I don't see any benefit other than for the industry itself.'' He said he would have preferred a much shorter time period.</p>
        <p>The pay phone resolution has been criticized by civic watchdog groups at a time when many of the Council's 51 members are raising record amounts in campaign contributions for next year's citywide elections. Increasingly, the members are also being pressed on various issues by a new breed of lobbyists who double as political consultants and, in some instances, even help elect the members in the first place.</p>
        <p>In this case, a handful of telecommunications and advertising companies hired several influential lobbyists, including the Parkside Group and a longtime political consultant, Hank Sheinkopf, to make the case for long-term pay phone franchises to at least a dozen council members and staff members.</p>
        <p>Harry E. Giannoulis, a partner in Parkside, which has close ties to Council Speaker Gifford Miller, confirmed that his firm had approached council members about the issue. Parkside has served as a paid political consultant for 15 of the council members, including Mr. Miller, but is not currently working for any of them, Mr. Giannoulis said. ''Lobbyists are retained by clients to communicate their point of view,'' he said, ''just as you hire an attorney to represent you in court.''</p>
        <p>The issue of outside interests wielding influence over city government prompted Mayor Bloomberg to call last month for limiting campaign contributions to $250 from people who do business with the city, a reduction from the current limits of between $2,750 and $4,950, depending on the office being sought. The proposal has been viewed skeptically by the mayor's political rivals because Mr. Bloomberg, who spent more than $72 million to finance his own election in 2001, would not be affected.</p>
        <p>Even so, campaign finance records show that council members routinely accept contributions from employees of companies that are affected by city laws, creating the potential for conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, who is expected to run for mayor next year, has received more than $27,000 from people employed by telecommunications companies including TCC Teleplex, Telebeam and Coastal Communications Service.</p>
        <p>In the past two years, telecommunications companies have also contributed $4,500 to Councilwoman Melinda R. Katz, the chairwoman of the Land Use Committee, which approved the pay phone resolution. Several members of her committee have also received significant contributions: Councilman Eric Gioia, $5,800; Councilman Tony Avella, $3,000; and Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, $1,500.</p>
        <p>David K. Chai, a spokesman for Mr. Miller, denied that the contributions had influenced the speaker's support of the resolution. ''The speaker makes decisions based on sound policy and what is ultimately best for New Yorkers,'' Mr. Chai said.</p>
        <p>The other council members also played down their contacts with the telecommunications companies; Mr. Gioia and Ms. Quinn said that they had not even been lobbied directly on the issue before they voted on it.</p>
        <p>Dennis Novick, president of TCC Teleplex, which operates 1,500 pay phones across the city, said yesterday that he had not approached council members directly about the 15-year provision in the contracts, but instead had tried to inform them in general about an increasingly tough business climate, in which he competes directly against cellphone companies. ''The Council is responding to the concerns of small businesses like myself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Critics said the controversy over the pay phones illustrated the larger problem of intertwined relationships among council members, lobbyists and special-interest groups in City Hall and raised concerns about whether the city's legislative body was putting for-profit businesses ahead of ordinary residents.</p>
        <p>''The telecom industry is a huge interest,'' said Rachel Leon, executive director of Common Cause New York, a citizens' group that focuses on lobbying in city and state government. ''Where there's smoke, there's often fire, and where there's high-stakes lobbying and campaign cash, there's often influence.''</p>
        <p>The resolution on the pay phones first surfaced on July 19 during a two-and-a-half-hour meeting of the zoning and franchises subcommittee, which is part of the Land Use Committee. It was unanimously approved by the entire Council two days later, after being coupled with other legislative matters.</p>
        <p>Several council members complained afterward that they did not realize the full implication of the resolution. ''It definitely needed more airing,'' said Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, chairwoman of the Technology in Government Committee. ''I don't know how I would have voted if there had been more discussion.''</p>
        <p>Councilman G. Oliver Koppell, a former state attorney general, opposed the resolution in committee but said he voted for it in the Council meeting only because he did not know it was included with the other legislation. He has not changed his mind about the resolution.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand the purpose of it,'' he said. ''It just doesn't make sense to me to say there's a minimum of 15 years -- that's a very long time. I think it cuts off flexibility where there ought to be flexibility.''</p>
        <p>The resolution, which was sponsored by Ms. Katz and Mr. Avella, proposed a 15-year term for franchise agreements and also specified that other services like Web telephones and public Internet terminals may be provided.</p>
        <p>The city receives part of the proceeds from the operation of the phones and the advertisements displayed upon them. Currently, there are 65 franchises covering 30,000 sidewalk pay phones, which generate close to $15 million annually in revenue for the city, Mr. Menchini said.</p>
        <p>Several council members and aides said that there was nothing unusual about long-term franchise contracts. They pointed out that the City Charter actually allows franchises to be granted for up to 25 years, and that in the past companies have secured 15-year franchises for bus stop shelters and cable television.</p>
        <p>More recently, the Bloomberg administration requested a 20-year franchise agreement as part of its ambitious plan to install automatic pay toilets, bus stop shelters, kiosks and newsstands on city streets. Mr. Avella said the administration had presented concerns similar to those that he raised on behalf of the telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>''So why are they giving us a hard time with the pay phones?'' Mr. Avella said. ''You can't use that argument on one, and then deny that it on exists on the other.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Menchini said that while he is not opposed to long-term franchises in general, he does not believe they would help the city in an area where the technology changes rapidly.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Katz said that long-term franchises were necessary to ensure that those same pay phones would be transformed with modern technology. She emphasized that even with last week's change, the Bloomberg administration still largely retained control over the process: setting specific conditions for the franchises, and choosing which companies receive them.</p>
