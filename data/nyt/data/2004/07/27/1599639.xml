        <p>A Taiwanese study released yesterday found that people who drank tea regularly had lower blood pressure than those who did not.</p>
        <p>The authors of the new study, in The Archives of Internal Medicine, noted that their study did not prove any cause and effect relationship. And they acknowledged that research into diet and disease risk is notoriously subject to what are called confounding effects: If all of the tea drinkers were also vegetarians who exercised strenuously, for instance, it would be difficult to say that their beverage was the factor that made a difference.</p>
        <p>While in some countries, like the Netherlands, Japan and the United States, tea drinking has been shown to be associated with healthier life styles, in others, like Scotland, it is not, the study said.</p>
        <p>In Taiwan, the habitual tea drinkers among the randomly chosen sample of 1,500 healthy men and women tended to be fatter and more likely to smoke, drink alcohol and consume salt, and were less likely to eat vegetables.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, blood pressure measurements were lower among the tea drinkers. The researchers calculated that the odds of developing hypertension were cut almost in half among those who drank one small cup a day, and by about two-thirds among those who drank 20 ounces or more daily. There was no difference between those who drank green and black tea.</p>
