        <p>As a Miami Dolphins season-ticket holder, Cliff Floyd said he ached when he heard that Ricky Williams was retiring. But as an injury-plagued professional athlete who often wakes up feeling like an N.F.L. running back on a Monday morning, he understood.</p>

        <p>MONTREAL, July 26 - As a Miami Dolphins season-ticket holder, Cliff Floyd said he ached when he heard that Ricky Williams was retiring. But as an injury-plagued professional athlete who often wakes up feeling like an N.F.L. running back on a Monday morning, he understood.</p>

        <p>As a Miami Dolphins season-ticket holder, Cliff Floyd said he ached when he heard that Ricky Williams was retiring. But as an injury-plagued professional athlete who often wakes up feeling like an N.F.L. running back on a Monday morning, he understood.</p>
        <p>Floyd, the Mets' left fielder, has been pondering his future for most of this season, and after Williams announced his retirement from the National Football League at age 27 on Sunday, Floyd asked himself once again how long he could keep playing baseball at the level he is used to.</p>
        <p>Floyd returned to Montreal on Monday, the place where his career began, and said that he planned to retire in two years, after the 2006 season, when his four-year, $26 million contract will expire. Floyd will be only 33, having played in fewer major league games than most of his peers, but he has already sustained enough injuries to last a career.</p>
        <p>''My body is beat up,'' said Floyd, who has had operations on his left knee, his right wrist and his right foot, and has missed a month of this season with a strained quadriceps. ''I want to go out there. I want to play because I really love the game. But I only know what I feel. At this point, two years can't come fast enough.''</p>
        <p>Floyd acknowledges that he might consider a part-time role near his home in Plantation, Fla., after the 2006 season -- ''I guess I could be the designated hitter for Tampa Bay,'' he said -- but he does not anticipate being a starting outfielder anymore.</p>
        <p>Although Floyd professes his loyalty to the Mets, and is hitting .277 with 13 home runs and 45 runs batted in, he says he fears that he will hurt the team if he is not at full strength in the field and on the bases.</p>
        <p>When the Mets play day games after night games, Floyd debates asking to be left out of the lineup. He said he could even see himself approaching General Manager Jim Duquette in the next two years about being traded to an American League team.</p>
        <p>He has become a vocal leader and a clubhouse spokesman, but many of his teammates do not realize how much pain he has to endure.</p>
        <p>There are mornings when his knee hurts so badly he can barely walk to the bathroom. There are afternoons when his Achilles' tendon is so sore that he cannot play with his daughter.</p>
        <p>There are nights when he wonders if he will eventually have to walk with a cane.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea what a N.F.L. player feels like, but when I get up, I feel like I played more than a baseball game,'' Floyd said. ''I won't sign another contract just for money. It's not always about money. I want to be able to take my kids to school.''</p>
        <p>Floyd will spend the off-season in Florida, watching the Miami Heat plus Shaquille O'Neal, and the Dolphins minus Williams.</p>
        <p>Benson Is Looking Unlikely</p>
        <p>Jim Duquette has been talking with the Pittsburgh Pirates for the past month about their starting pitcher Kris Benson, but as Saturday's trading deadline approaches, the Mets appear to be falling out of the conversation.</p>
        <p>The Pirates do not seem interested in Ty Wigginton and are concentrating on the Minnesota Twins and the Anaheim Angels as the front-runners for acquiring Benson.</p>
        <p>The Twins and the Angels may be willing to offer greater value for Benson, considering they are more legitimate contenders than the Mets.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of reason why the Mets do not want to give up their prized prospects for a pitcher who will be a free agent after this season. Heading into Monday night, the Mets had lost 9 of 12 games and were in fourth place in the National League East, five games out of first. Duquette is intent on improving the club, but the Mets are caught squarely between a buying and a selling mode.</p>
        <p>The next four games could determine what Duquette does Saturday. If the Mets re-establish themselves, Duquette will be more likely to add. If they continue to falter, he will have to be more cautious and might be tempted to pare a veteran.</p>
        <p>''It's important for us to win a few down the stretch to the trading deadline so that doesn't creep into the mind-set,'' Manager Art Howe said. ''We've got to get people excited again.''</p>
        <p>Piazza to Return Tonight</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza took batting practice on Monday with a sprained left wrist and caught starting pitcher Jae Seo during a bullpen session.</p>
        <p>Piazza said he would be available, but plans to start Tuesday in Montreal.</p>
        <p>There will be significant pressure on Piazza to lift the team when he returns, but he said he was trying not to pay attention.</p>
        <p>''I've found it advantageous to go out there with blinders on,'' Piazza said. ''I don't think by any means we're dead and buried.''</p>
