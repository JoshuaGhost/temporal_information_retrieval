      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Arab states called for an emergency United Nations General Assembly session this Friday to demand that Israel obey a ruling by the International Court of Justice against the barrier being constructed in the West Bank. The court, based in The Hague, ruled Friday that a major portion of the barrier violated international law and should be dismantled, with compensation paid to Palestinians on whose land it cut across. General Assembly resolutions do not carry the weight of international law that decisions of the Security Council do, but the Palestinian representative to the United Nations said Arab nations would turn to the 15-member Council later after they had made ''an evaluation of the situation on the ground.''</p>
