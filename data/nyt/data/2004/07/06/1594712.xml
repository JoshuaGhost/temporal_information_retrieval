        <p>I always have my Sporty's Electronic E6B flight computer along as emergency backup. When I have to recalculate my flight plan due to thunderstorms, mechanical problems or low fuel, I'm so stressed I can't add 2 and 2. You never know when your life is going to depend on a device that fits in your shirt pocket and runs on AAA batteries.</p>
        <p>Whenever I fly to a triathlon, I'm dressed in my running shorts and jog bra. But if my destination is a business meeting, I'm flying in a suit and high heels. I don't have air-conditioning; have you priced an air-conditioning unit for aircraft lately? The first time I flew for business was in the dead heat of summer. I started in a fresh, new pair of pantyhose and a crisp, tailored suit and ended with sticky, sweaty legs. I felt as if I'd been asphyxiated in Saran Wrap. Only once do you make that mistake. My cockpit is all glass; there's nothing to shade you. I perfected the art of taking off pantyhose midflight.</p>

        <p>Whenever I fly to a triathlon, I'm dressed in my running shorts and jog bra. But if my destination is a business meeting, I'm flying in a suit and high heels. I don't have air-conditioning; have you priced an air-conditioning unit for aircraft lately? The first time I flew for business was in the dead heat of summer. I started in a fresh, new pair of pantyhose and a crisp, tailored suit and ended with sticky, sweaty legs. I felt as if I'd been asphyxiated in Saran Wrap. Only once do you make that mistake. My cockpit is all glass; there's nothing to shade you. I perfected the art of taking off pantyhose midflight.</p>
        <p>Whenever I'm in a suit, it's Murphy's Law that outside it's 90 degrees, I'm dripping perspiration and air traffic control puts me in a holding pattern. You've got to think survival, so I've invented a low-tech trick of the trade: I hike my skirt over the yoke, which is much like the steering wheel of a car, I open the air vents at knee level and let 'er rip. Marilyn Monroe standing on that street grating has nothing on me.</p>
        <p>No matter if I deplane in the jog bra and shorts or the business suit, it usually gains some attention. Imagine getting out of a low sports car. One leg swings out on the wing, so when you pull yourself out, you're all leg. Once I landed in El Paso in a Beechcraft Baron with a girlfriend who owns the aircraft. The mechanic on the field, who's dressed in overalls, oil under his fingernails, is wiping his hands with a rag. He saunters across the tarmac to meet the plane and exclaims, wide-eyed: ''Daaamn, I have died and gone to heaven. Two womens'' -- that's what he said -- ''in a Baron and no man.''</p>
        <p>It's been an interesting journey in a man's field. I'm thinking of changing my name to Sir because air traffic controllers practically never call me ma'am. I'll get ''sir'' over and over in the same radio communication, and even if they then stutter ''ma'am,'' they never apologize. It's a relief when I get one of the few women air traffic controllers. Just once would I love to say to the guys: ''Hello, there are two sexes in the world. You chose the wrong one.''</p>
        <p>Once, an auditor asked me to transport him from Louisville to Paducah and back, to see a client. He wasn't used to small planes, and on our return leg, the cockpit was hot and turbulent, we were circling in a holding pattern and he had just eaten lunch. All the perfect ingredients for motion sickness. I heard a violent belch as he lunged toward a plastic bag, with only modest success.</p>
        <p>As a woman, you always wonder how a man feels when he throws up in the cockpit of a woman's plane. He was mortified, his head hung low in embarrassment. If it had been two guys in that cockpit, they would've done the whole guy thing: laughed about it, called each other ''wuss'' and ended up with a high five.</p>
        <p>To top it off, as men have done for centuries, he left the mess behind for the little woman to clean up. I was not that put out about the task, which shows you what a woman will do: I picked up the bag, I cleaned the upholstery, I Windexed the windshield and put my plane away.</p>
