      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Nothing may more vividly reflect the Republican Party's difficulty finding a suitable candidate for the Senate here than its flirtation this week with the former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditka, who has made news with his enthusiastic drinking and gambling, volcanic temper and support for public executions, withdrew from the race Wednesday night after several days of flirtation.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how I'd do on the Senate floor if I got in a confrontation with someone I didn't appreciate or maybe didn't appreciate me,'' Mr. Ditka said.</p>
        <p>The nomination opened up last month when Jack Ryan, the millionaire businessman who won the Republican primary in March, quit the race after accusations that he had taken his ex-wife to sex clubs against her will. No heavyweight politician has come forward to replace Mr. Ryan, partly because the Democratic nominee, State Senator Barack Obama, is highly popular and lavishly financed. On Wednesday, the Democrats announced that Mr. Obama would be the keynote speaker at their national convention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditka was not close to being the most outlandish possible Republican candidate. Commentators here have half-seriously proposed Michael Jordan, Ernie Banks, Cindy Crawford and Oprah Winfrey. None of these figures have indicated any interest in the race. It is not even clear that they are Republicans, and at least one of them, Mr. Jordan, has contributed to the Obama campaign.</p>
        <p>As the situation degenerates into the realm of comic opera, satirists have begun suggesting fictional candidates. One proposed the cartoon character Homer Simpson (''a resident of Springfield''), and another suggested that deep-dish pepperoni pizza should get the nod (''diversity, name recognition and immense popularity'').</p>
        <p>''I seriously doubt that the Republicans, even in their wildest dreams, ever expected to be in this position,'' said Kent Redfield, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Springfield. ''The chances of this turning into a national joke are very high. It will be a three-ring circus.''</p>
        <p>Republican leaders are eager to do whatever possible to hold the seat of Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, who is retiring. On Tuesday, Senator George Allen of Virginia, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee and son of a former Washington Redskins coach, flew to Chicago to meet with Mr. Ditka. The head of the Illinois Republican party, Judy Baar Topinka, also attended.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ditka, Mary Albright, said he had not made up his mind. ''He has some things he needs to sort out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Those may have included myriad business obligations. Mr. Ditka is a motivational speaker, owns a steakhouse in Chicago, works as a sports commentator and is about to introduce his own line of sportswear. He is also a pitchman for Levitra, an anti-impotency drug.</p>
        <p>Republicans have named a 19-member committee to review candidates. One member, Dennis P. Wiggins, said that although there was no official deadline for a decision, one could come this week. Statewide candidates in Illinois generally win by appealing to independents, soccer moms and suburbanites. Voters in those groups mighty not have been drawn to a self-described ultraconservative with a supermacho image like Mr. Ditka.</p>
        <p>Wisecracks about Mr. Ditka, many of them involving his work for Levitra, began circulating several days ago and have become steadily more vulgar, suggesting that late-night comics might have wound up being the greatest beneficiaries of a Ditka candidacy.</p>
        <p>Several other people who had been considered possible candidates for the Republican nomination, among them State Senator Steve Rauschenberger and a businessman who is a former chairman of the State Board of Education, Ronald Gidwitz, took themselves out of consideration before Mr. Ditka's name surfaced. Among those still interested are Andrea Grubb Barthwell, who last week resigned as a deputy director in the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Jim Oberweis, who owns a chain of ice cream parlors and finished second to Mr. Ryan in the March primary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditka, 64, is not registered to vote in Illinois, but is registered in Florida, where he owns a home.</p>
        <p>Until Mr. Ditka's name was brought up a few days ago on a Web site that was apparently started partly as a joke, Illinois Republican leaders were insisting that they would carefully review the records of all prospective candidates. They might have had to loosen their standards for Mr. Ditka, who once paid a $20,000 fine to the National Football League for grabbing his crotch during a game and shouting obscenities at fans, and who was ejected from a New Orleans casino after, it was reported, throwing his cigar at a pit boss. He was convicted of drunken driving in 1985, but not before his lawyer set off a wave of applause in the courtroom by asserting, ''Mr. Ditka does not want anyone to believe he got preferential treatment because his team is 9 and 0.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ditka, who coached the Bears to victory in the 1985 Super Bowl, turns up occasionally at Republican fund-raising events. At one in 1992 he said, ''If the Clinton-Gore team was ever elected, it would be the biggest step backward this country has taken in its 200 years of existence.'' More recently he allowed that he was ''not so sure that public hangings don't have a place in society.''</p>
