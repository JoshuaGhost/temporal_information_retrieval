        <p>NEWARK, July 8 - The president of the agency that owns Giants Stadium confirmed on Thursday that it and the New York Giants were "taking a look" at building a new stadium.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The president of the agency that owns Giants Stadium confirmed on Thursday that it and the New York Giants were ''taking a look'' at building a new stadium.</p>
        <p>George R. Zoffinger, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said that the team was also looking into the option of making extensive renovations to add more premium seating and other amenities to the stadium, which is 28 years old.</p>
        <p>According to current estimates, renovations to the stadium could cost about $300 million. Building a new stadium -- the team and the authority are considering a site within a half-mile of Giants Stadium -- could cost about $600 million.</p>
        <p>''The thought was that this is one of the things we should look at, since we're spending a lot of money already,'' Mr. Zoffinger said in an interview. ''That's all we're doing is taking a look.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zoffinger said that by this fall the team and the authority should arrive at a decision.</p>
        <p>Word that the move was being considered was reported Thursday in The Record of Hackensack.</p>
        <p>If the authority proceeds with plans for a new stadium, it will join a collection of three other major sports construction projects being planned in the New York area.</p>
        <p>The Jets, the team that has shared Giants Stadium with the Giants since 1984, is vying for its own 75,000-seat, $1.4 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Officials with the New Jersey Nets are planning a basketball arena in Brooklyn, and New Jersey Devils executives are eyeing a hockey arena in Newark.</p>
        <p>Officials with the Giants said their decision on a Meadowlands stadium would not hinge on the fate of the Jets' West Side project, which is well along in planning but has been criticized for its location and cost to taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''I don't really think it affects us one way or the other,'' said John K. Mara, the Giants' executive vice president. ''This is a big enough market that it can support two stadiums.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mara said the team's concerns went beyond the mere cost of building a new stadium.</p>
        <p>''If we do a renovation, parts of the building are still going to be 28 years old,'' he said. Mr. Mara noted that other factors to consider are possible seat removal in a renovation or logistical issues raised by a new project.</p>
        <p>''We want to do our due diligence,'' Mr. Mara said.</p>
        <p>Paying for whatever changes take place at the Giants Stadium is also a consideration. Although the Jets' plan calls for $600 million of the new stadium's cost to be financed with state and city money, both Mr. Zoffinger and Gov. James E. McGreevey have repeatedly said that they would not use tax dollars to subsidize sports construction projects.</p>
