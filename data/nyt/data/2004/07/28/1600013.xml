        <p>The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, and a county legislator have called on the New York State comptroller to conduct a thorough audit of the Westchester Medical Center, which has been beset by financial troubles. The hospital recently announced that it lost $83 million last year and has projected a loss of $31.6 million this year. But a report in The Journal News on Sunday that showed spending on air travel, expensive hotels and limousines by a consulting firm with no hospital experience prompted Mr. Spano and the legislator, William Ryan, chairman of the Board of Legislators, to request the state audit. Jennifer Freeman, a spokeswoman for Alan G. Hevesi, the comptroller, said, ''We are aware of the matter, and we are looking into it.''</p>
