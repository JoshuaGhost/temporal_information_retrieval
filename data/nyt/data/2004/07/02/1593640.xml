        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>* BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday at 6:15 p.m. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. Also at Danny's: tonight at 9:15 and Sunday at 2 p.m., ''The George M. Cohan Revue,'' by Chip Deffaa, with Jonny Peterson; tonight and tomorrow night from 9 to 1, Jerry Scott, singer and pianist; tomorrow night at 9:30, Grayce Coviello, singer; Sunday night from 8 to midnight, Scott Ailing with Ryan Hunt. Cover: none to $25; two-drink minimum.</p>
