        <p>When Aaron Peirsol pulled himself up on a lane line and pumped his fist at the crowd after breaking the world record in the 200-meter backstroke Monday at the Olympic swimming trials, he might as well have been trumpeting the whole United States men's team.</p>
        <p>With only a few events left to swim here, the team has largely taken shape. The women have made a decent showing, but the men have been dominating center stage. Five of the six world records at this meet have been set by male swimmers, and the men have formed a team that looks like an Olympic powerhouse.</p>

        <p>When Aaron Peirsol pulled himself up on a lane line and pumped his fist at the crowd after breaking the world record in the 200-meter backstroke Monday at the Olympic swimming trials, he might as well have been trumpeting the whole United States men's team.</p>
        <p>With only a few events left to swim here, the team has largely taken shape. The women have made a decent showing, but the men have been dominating center stage. Five of the six world records at this meet have been set by male swimmers, and the men have formed a team that looks like an Olympic powerhouse.</p>
        <p>''The men's team is as good as I've seen since '76,'' said Eddie Reese, the Olympic men's coach. ''As far as world-record holders, in the worldwide competition, it's an extraordinary team.''</p>
        <p>Peirsol (200 backstroke), Michael Phelps (400 individual medley) and Ian Crocker (100 butterfly Tuesday night) all lowered world records they already held. Brendan Hansen became the world-record holder in the 100 and 200 breaststroke. Those performances gave the United States a world-record holder in 8 of 14 events. The team also holds the world record in the 400 medley relay.</p>
        <p>If the medal-winning went according to swimmers' times as they are currently ranked in the world, the United States men would take home 21 medals; the women would win 12. Together, they are trying to surpass their haul of 33 total medals at the 2000 Games. The men and women each won seven gold medals; the men had 17 total medals, the women 16.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the amazing part of the United States team's performance in Sydney was that it followed an Olympic trials in which many doubted the strength of the team. American swimmers did not set a single world record at that meet. At the time, they chalked it up to the nerve-racking nature of the trials, which almost every swimmer says is far more tense than the Olympics. In some cases, a third-place swimmer here would be the third-best swimmer in the world in that event.</p>
        <p>''You finish third in the Olympics and you're holding a medal,'' said Gary Hall Jr., who qualified here for his third Olympic team. ''You finish third in the trials and you're holding a remote.''</p>
        <p>It is a different world than 1976, when each country could take three swimmers per event, instead of the current two. In '76, in Montreal, the United States men swept all three medals in four events, took home 27 medals in all and won gold in 12 of the 13 events.</p>
        <p>''We're in a different era and competition is great,'' Reese said. ''This team will definitely make me look like a better coach than I am.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, the United States women hold only two world records, including the one set by Amanda Beard in the 200 breaststroke Monday. The only American women ranked No. 1 in the world in their event are Beard in the 200 breaststroke, Katie Hoff in the 400 individual medley and Natalie Coughlin in the 100 backstroke.</p>
        <p>The women still have the depth to contend for gold medals in all three relays. That is why Jenny Thompson, who has never won an individual gold medal in her three previous Olympics, has eight golds from relays.</p>
        <p>The men are not as dominant in relays. They are trying to wrest the top spot in the world in the 400 and 800 freestyle relays from Australia.</p>
        <p>But in the individual events, all eyes will be on the United States men.</p>
        <p>Part of the dominance comes strictly from the phenomenon that is Phelps. Since he made the 2000 Olympic team as a 15-year-old, he has blossomed into the world's most spectacular all-around swimmer. He holds world records in the 200 and 400 individual medleys and in the 200 butterfly. He also continually threatens Peirsol in the 200 back and Crocker in the 100 butterfly.</p>
        <p>Jonty Skinner, a former world-record holder himself, is USA Swimming's national team technical director. His job is to watch the American swimmers for flaws in their technique or training and suggest ways to improve.</p>
        <p>Despite a recent push, the United States still lags behind several countries, however, in the amount of scientific research put into swimming. Australia credits much of its success to its technical program.</p>
        <p>Skinner, though, has studied the sport for years and said that he felt American swimmers would be setting a lot of world records.</p>
        <p>''I have a small theory I call the theory of critical mass,'' Skinner said. ''When you get enough athletes close to the top end of a performance level, then you're going to have a breakout. Some kid's going to break out from that mass and take a leapfrog forward into an area where no one's gone before. There are quite a number of events at this meet that have pushed to that limit.''</p>
        <p>The freestyle events are the weakest internationally for the United States men. Jason Lezak did swim the fastest time in the world this year in the 100 freestyle here, but in the 200, Phelps has not been able to poke into the neighborhood dominated by Ian Thorpe of Australia. And Klete Keller has not reached Thorpe's or Grant Hackett's level in the 400. United States swimmers rarely contend in the 1,500.</p>
        <p>The weaknesses pretty much end there.</p>
        <p>''All of our top two guys are medal contenders and that kind of depth is really exciting,'' said Josh Davis, a member of the past two Olympic teams. ''People ask me, 'Who's the competition?' And I say, 'Nobody.' Australia's good in places, Russia's got some good guys here and there, but across the board, nobody has our depth.''</p>
        <p>Which means that there could be a lot of Peirsol's kind of celebration in Athens.</p>
