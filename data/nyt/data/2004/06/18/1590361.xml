        <p>Senior Pentagon officials acknowledged Thursday that a suspected Iraqi terrorist who was held in a military jail -- but kept off prison rosters -- should have been registered more quickly with the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
        <p>But the officials said the fact that the secret detention of the captive, who was jailed near the Baghdad airport without records, stretched for seven months was probably attributable to a bureaucratic breakdown.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday at a Pentagon news briefing that he ordered the detainee held without a registration number at the written request of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence.</p>
        <p>At the same briefing, Daniel J. Dell'Orto, the Pentagon's principal deputy general counsel, said the initial decision to hold the detainee without registering him was permissible, at least temporarily, for security reasons.</p>
        <p>But he added: ''We should have registered him much sooner than we did. It didn't have to be at the very instant we brought him into our custody. And that's something that we'll just have to examine as to whether there was a breakdown in the quickness with which we registered him.''</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials declined to discuss Mr. Tenet's reason for wanting the detainee, believed to be a high-ranking officer of Ansar al-Islam, a terrorist organization, held off the prison rolls. An agency spokesman said the C.I.A. would have no comment on Mr. Tenet's reasoning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld said the detainee, who is still in military detention in Iraq, has been treated humanely. Officials said he was now being registered with the Red Cross.</p>
        <p>A Human Rights Watch report last week identified 13 ''ghost detainees'' taken into United States custody since Sept. 11, 2001. The author of the report, Reed Brody, said the 13 were either being held in undisclosed detention facilities, or the United States government had not acknowledged holding them.</p>
        <p>The detainees are all associated with Al Qaeda and include Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, whose interrogations were discussed at the Sept. 11 commission hearings this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brody's staff identified the 13 detainees by tracking their arrests, largely from news reports or interviews with their relatives, he said. They were arrested in Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Morocco and other countries.</p>
        <p>''What's clear in these cases is that they're being held in situations that are equal to or worse than Triple X,'' said Mr. Brody, referring to the Ansar detainee in Iraq. ''They are being held outside anybody's scrutiny. We have no idea in most cases whether these people are dead or alive.''</p>
        <p>Also on Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected a proposal by two Democratic senators, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein of California, to subpoena Justice Department documents on the administration's policies regarding the treatment of prisoners. The proposal, which was rejected in a 10-9 vote, identified 23 memos, letters or reports from Sept. 25, 2001, through March of this year on topics that included the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and rules for interrogation.</p>
        <p>According to the proposal, the documents include a memo from Mr. Rumsfeld to Gen. James T. Hill, the senior officer of the Southern Command, dated April 2003 and titled, ''Coercive interrogation techniques that can be used with approval of the Defense Secretary.'' Another memo dated Jan. 4, 2004, written by the top legal adviser to Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior American commander in Iraq, and sent to military intelligence and police personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison, is titled, ''New plan to restrict Red Cross access to Abu Ghraib.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy and several other senators asked Attorney General John Ashcroft for some of the documents at a June 8 hearing, but Mr. Ashcroft said he would not hand them over, an aide to Mr. Leahy said.</p>
        <p>''A formal request would have to come by way of subpoena under the rules of the Senate,'' said Mark Corallo, a Department of Justice spokesman. ''You would think that senators would know their own Senate rules.''</p>
        <p>Before the vote was taken, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin G. Hatch, told committee members that he had read several of the memos and advised them against voting for the proposal.</p>
        <p>''We should not reveal our interrogation techniques to our enemies,'' said Senator Hatch, Republican of Utah. ''There must be some reasonable limits on what can and should be disclosed by the executive branch to Congress and the public about the war against terrorism.''</p>
