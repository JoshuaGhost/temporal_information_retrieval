        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would send letters to all city employees to remind those responsible for child support payments to keep up with them. The mayor noted that if a city employee refused to do so, the city's Office of Child Support Enforcement could take legal steps like seizing a tax refund, freezing bank accounts and suspending a driver's license. ''Child support payments are not optional,'' the mayor wrote.</p>
