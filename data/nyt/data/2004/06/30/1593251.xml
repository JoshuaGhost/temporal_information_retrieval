        <p>A former pizza deliveryman who raised suspicions after the Sept. 11 terror attack by photographing a scenic vista in Hudson, N.Y., near a local water-treatment plant, was told yesterday that he must leave the country.</p>
        <p>The decision by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement means that arrangements to deport the deliveryman, Ansar Mahmood, 27, a legal immigrant from Pakistan, will begin immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahmood was cleared of any ties to terrorism, including tampering with the water supply. But investigators charged him with harboring illegal aliens, a felony, after uncovering evidence that he had helped some Pakistanis with expired visas obtain housing and a car, according to immigration officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahmood pleaded guilty to the charge in early 2002 and faced deportation as a result. He has been held in a federal detention center outside Buffalo, where he has continued to challenge his deportation, aided by a group of peace advocates in Columbia County, where he lived and worked.</p>
        <p>After withdrawing his final appeal, Mr. Mahmood sought to have his deportation deferred, a rarely used discretionary action by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that places a lower priority on an alien's removal from the country. The practical result is that the individual is allowed to stay.</p>
        <p>But in turning down his request, the agency contended that Mr. Mahmood ''chose to break the immigration laws which allowed him to immigrate to this country'' in the first place, said Michael W. Gilhooly, an agency spokesman. (Mr. Mahmood had won a green card through a lottery in Pakistan.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilhooly said the decision showed that the agency was ''committed to returning the integrity to this country's immigration system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahmood's supporters criticized the action. Senator Charles E. Schumer, who had written on Mr. Mahmood's behalf along with six other United States senators, said in a phone interview that the decision demonstrated the ''brutal unfairness'' of the agency's ''zero tolerance policy.''</p>
        <p>The peace advocates who rallied to Mr. Mahmood's support faulted the federal government for prosecuting Mr. Mahmood while ignoring the many American citizens who harbor illegal aliens by employing nannies and other household help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahmood, one of nine children, had told a number of journalists who covered his case that he wanted to stay in the United States so he could continue to support his impoverished family in Pakistan.</p>
