        <p>YOU'D think that of all the chefs in New York, Mario Batali would be the least likely to open a lounge. But the meatpacking district is doing strange things to the restaurateurs of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Three-hundred-seat pleasure palaces that offer not just ambitious food but variations on wine, women and song as well are taking over the neighborhood. Restaurateurs are virtually elbowing each other to get at the young, spending crowd that makes the corner of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue ring every night with the sound of kitten heels on paving stones.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge gamble,'' said Stephen Hanson, who paid rent on the space for Vento, a restaurant and dance club on Hudson Street, for five years before finally opening it last month. Mr. Hanson says he was waiting for other restaurants and hotels to open, so that a critical mass of customers would be there. ''Only Times Square used to have the clientele to support these big-box restaurants,'' he said. ''Now the meatpacking can do it too.'' When its sidewalk cafe is open, Vento has 380 seats to fill, and it can hold another 140 bodies in the basement club.</p>
        <p>Recently, the semi-warm weather and summer tourists in search of ''Sex and the City'' vibe have brought waves of tube-topped young pleasure-seekers to the neighborhood. At the Maritime Hotel on 16th Street and Ninth Avenue, two restaurants (Matsuri and La Bottega), an outside patio bar and a huge subterranean bar (Hiro) can pack in more than 600 people at one time. On Saturday night, through the chilly drizzle, Katrina Block of Staten Island tripped from one end of the hotel to the other, in search of a party of 12 that she knew was somewhere at the Maritime.</p>
        <p>''This place is too big,'' she moaned, rubbing her silver-pedicured feet.</p>
        <p>The surging crowds and idling cars have quickly transformed this once subdued area, according to Jo Hamilton, a co-leader (with a longtime neighborhood restaurateur, Florent Morellet) of Save Gansevoort Market. The group helped win a historic-district designation for the area from the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission last year, and is lobbying the New York State Liquor Authority to limit the number of licenses it grants in the area.</p>
        <p>''These are wonderful restaurants, but they are just too big,'' Ms. Hamilton said. ''In the last month, with sidewalk cafes and roof decks opening, things have gotten totally out of control.''</p>
        <p>There are more supersize restaurants to come. Stephen Starr, a Philadelphia restaurant impresario, is soon opening Buddakan, a modern Asian spread with 300 seats, inside Chelsea Market. ''Asian food is the only thing big enough to fill these restaurants,'' Mr. Starr said. ''You can't serve Mediterranean food and expect 300 people.''</p>
        <p>That will be news to Mr. Batali, who will open Il Posto, a 19,000-square-foot restaurant and lounge, with two partners, Joseph and Lidia Bastianich, in December. PÃ³ on Cornelia Street, Mr. Batali's first New York restaurant, made him famous in less than 1,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>The new place will be ''like eating in a Roman palazzo,'' Mr. Bastianich said. ''Or a grand restaurant in Torino in 1960, with pastas finished at the table and a bollito cart,'' he said, referring to the gleaming carts traditionally used for serving bollito misto, the Emilian specialty of simmered meats and sausages that is Italy's contribution to the world of pot-au-feu and shabu-shabu.</p>
        <p>So will New Yorkers prefer boiled tongue or raw fluke? It hardly seems to matter. To draw crowds of this magnitude, the new places must have not only food but also music, models, beds, cabanas and sweeping staircases long enough to ascend to heaven, also known in this neighborhood as the rooftop pool of the Gansevoort Hotel. Not since the days of the Forum of the 12 Caesars has the theater of dining been so out in the open, and the food so incidental.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr knows that Christian Liaigre is choosing the fabrics for Buddakan, but he doesn't know exactly who the chef will be. ''With big places, design is even more important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Spice Market, also an Asian fantasia, the restaurant's billowing textiles, carved-wood screens and pajama-clad servers are part of the show; at Megu in TriBeCa, the Japanese food could hardly be more theatrical, but still it can barely compete with a looming ice sculpture, thousands of bolts of kimono cloth, and yet another vertiginous staircase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanson, who has been opening restaurants in Manhattan since 1987, takes a practical approach to developing big spaces. ''You want it to be bionic,'' he said, ''so you can shut down different pieces -- the lounge, or the sidewalk cafe if the people aren't there. Fifty people in a 100-seat room is O.K. Fifty people in a 300-seat room is death.''</p>
