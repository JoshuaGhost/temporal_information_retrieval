        <p>IT began as a simple way of getting computers and other devices to play nicely together. But it has given rise to a stream of gadgets far more exotic than the printers and mouses it was designed to accommodate.</p>
        <p>Its initials have also become increasingly familiar in the digital lexicon: U.S.B., for universal serial bus.</p>
        <p>U.S.B. ports, and the plugs that fit them, make it easier to connect devices to a computer, eliminating screwdriver-heavy tasks and the need to reboot the computer every time a new piece of equipment is plugged in.</p>
        <p>But perhaps most important, two of a U.S.B. cable's four wires carry not data but juice: enough current to run small to midsize gadgets with no need for batteries or AC adapters.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, when the technology first appeared, U.S.B. meant keyboards, joysticks and the like. But manufacturers began cottoning to U.S.B.'s ability to provide a power source, leading to a host of gizmos that have nothing to do with computers: radios, reading lights, even massage balls and air purifiers.</p>
        <p>And as Scott Smith of the online retailer ThinkGeek (www.thinkgeek.com) points out, the universality of U.S.B. (that's what the U stands for, after all) means fewer international adapters for globetrotters to lug around.</p>
        <p>Though many of the latest arrivals fall at the absurd end of the gadget continuum -- like a U.S.B. flash drive shaped like a rubber duck -- many are innovative, even ingenious: a U.S.B. cellphone charger, for example, lets you use your laptop for on-the-road SOS.</p>
        <p>So the next time a blackout hits, your laptop's robust battery might find itself powering more than just your palmtop.</p>
