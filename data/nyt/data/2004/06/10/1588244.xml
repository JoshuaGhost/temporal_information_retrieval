        <p>THE biggest problem with Father's Day is that it occurs at the wrong time of year. In my household it would make more sense to celebrate the holiday in, say, October, when certain fathers could spend the day lying on the couch watching football.</p>

        <p>THE biggest problem with Father's Day is that it occurs at the wrong time of year. In my household it would make more sense to celebrate the holiday in, say, October, when certain fathers could spend the day lying on the couch watching football.</p>
        <p>Right there, you would have enough of a distraction to keep certain fathers from noticing whether the gifts were any good.</p>
        <p>Under my October scenario, the day would pass uneventfully as my daughters supplied my husband with steady snacks. During halftime, they could divert him with a spirited performance of the Ballet of Beers, with choreography that included graceful glissades to and from the refrigerator, punctuated by a spirited pas jet√© to retrieve his bottle opener.</p>
        <p>Instead, we have a June holiday. So Father's Day stands for forced grilling, complicated marinades and a vague sense that the yard work is going undone. Plus, the bright judgmental sunlight of early summer falls squarely on the gifts.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, this year my husband decided to head off the usual gift remorse by telling the rest of us exactly what he wanted.</p>
        <p>''Boomerang phrase sampler,'' he said one day last week.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, neither the children nor I knew what this was.</p>
        <p>We suspected consumer electronics.</p>
        <p>My husband said a Boomerang phrase sampler was a gift he could use while sitting on the sofa. He said it was something he liked as much as professional football. He said he had wanted it for a long time.</p>
        <p>''It probably has a cord,'' my 6-year-old daughter said.</p>
        <p>She was right. A visit to www.boomerangmusic.com revealed that the Boomerang was a device on which musicians can record an endless accompaniment to play along with.</p>
        <p>A phone call to Mike Nelson of Boomerang Musical Products revealed exactly how my husband would use the Boomerang while he played his guitar.</p>
        <p>''Most people like a jam partner,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''When you're just sitting there, it's really cool to have somebody back you up. This is like an ego-less partner. The difference between the Boomerang and a tape recorder is that it will play endlessly and you don't have to rewind it.''</p>
        <p>I could see the allure. Bravely I let go of my preconceptions about Father's Day gifts -- goodbye, leather travel wallet ($45 at www.redenvelope.com), so long midcalf dress socks ($18 at www.nordstrom.com) -- and decided to buy the Boomerang.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nelson, who created the Boomerang with Lee Hardesty, said the Boomerang's list price was five ninety-nine.</p>
        <p>''You mean five dollars and ninety-nine cents?'' I asked in the tone of a person who only recently stopped believing in the tooth fairy.</p>
        <p>No, he meant $599.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Nelson's Web site does not sell the Boomerang directly. However, he said, most retailers discount the device. Its street price, he said, typically ranged from $399 to $429; he added that he was having ''an issue'' with one retailer, whom he described as ''a guy who's not following our minimum advertised price policies by selling on eBay.com for $379.99.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson directed me to a list of retailers at boomerangmusic.com, where I found two that were near my house. I feared I might have to drive to an actual store to buy the sampler. I feared it would be heavy. Most of all, I feared the cost.</p>
        <p>But first, reconnaissance. I visited both retailers' sites, at www.bananas.com and at www.haight-ashbury-music.com, and then phoned. The news was not good. Bananas.com did not have the Boomerang in stock; it might take as long as 10 business days to get it. Haight Ashbury Music had stock, but the price was five-oh-nine.</p>
        <p>By this time, I knew better than to ask if that meant $5.09.</p>
        <p>Maybe my husband would like something else with a cord?</p>
        <p>I consulted other father's-gift experts. Jon Robbins, the chief operating officer at Hifi House, which sells high-end audio and visual equipment (www.hifihousegroup.com), said other fathers were asking for gifts like a Sharp wireless 15-inch L.C.D. TV ($1,394.99 at Amazon.com), to enable them to take the television outside to watch baseball in peace.</p>
        <p>''We've come a long way from dress socks,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Dads are worth it, aren't they?'' Mr. Robbins asked.</p>
        <p>Next I visited www.consumerreports.org, which has published its third annual list of Father's Day recommendations. An effort had been made to test gifts that fathers would truly like in categories like car accessories and electronics, according to Helen Popkin, the site's associate Web editor.</p>
        <p>''You didn't test any neckties?'' I asked Ms. Popkin during a phone interview.</p>
        <p>''We tested no neckties,'' she said. ''But we chose many other specific products, like drills and grills, highlighted from our most recent ratings over the past year.''</p>
        <p>Although the site doesn't sell products, the recommendations included specific model numbers and typical retail prices, making it easy for a shopper to hunt elsewhere for a highly rated laser level like, say, the ''Black &amp; Decker BDL 100S Bullseye, approximate retail price: $65-$70.''</p>
        <p>Amazon had a new laser level for $69.34 and a used one for $48.58.</p>
        <p>Informed of these prices, my husband said he did not want a laser level. But, he added, the phrase ''used one'' reminded him: he did not want a new Boomerang, which he described as ''too expensive.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he helpfully e-mailed me a link to a used Boomerang currently for sale through eBay.</p>
        <p>In fact, there were nearly a dozen new and used Boomerangs for sale at eBay, including two new ones with ''Buy It Now'' sticker prices of $379.99. I shied away from those out of loyalty to the Boomerang's creator, Mr. Nelson, who had been kind enough to tip me to the fact that I should be able to buy a used Boomerang for about $300.</p>
        <p>I bid $300 on one used Boomerang. I was outbid.</p>
        <p>A second used Boomerang had three bids, the current one at $157.50. But the ''But It Now'' price, $399.99, was unusually high. Should I bid? The fine print said the seller was Musicgoround.com. I visited the seller's site, where I saw that two identical used Boomerangs were for sale at $299.99 apiece. I phoned.</p>
        <p>''Uh-oh, the eBay reserve was supposed to be $299, not $399,'' a customer service representative named Vic said.</p>
        <p>I asked if I could place a phone order for the second Boomerang (he said yes, for $299.99 plus $20 for shipping) and if it came with a warranty (he said yes, for 30 days).</p>
        <p>Then he took my credit card information, processed the order and, after shipping the Boomerang that day, e-mailed me a tracking number.</p>
        <p>It could be a pretty good Father's Day, considering that it's not October. The only major hurdle is for my girls to choreograph a dance to accompany grilled meat. They're working on the Ballet of Beef.</p>
