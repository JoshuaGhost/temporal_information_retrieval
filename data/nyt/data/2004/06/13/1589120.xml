        <p>Razor &amp; Tie rerecords Top 40 hits, using singers 5 to 12</p>

        <p>BEYONCÉ'S ''Crazy in Love'' was last summer's inescapable Top 40 hit, booming nonstop from the Jersey Shore to northern Sweden. And even though it has long since faded from the charts, the tune is still raking in money -- albeit without Beyoncé belting out the chorus. As featured on ''Kidz Bop 5,'' a new CD, the song is performed by an anonymous crew of grade-school students, whose twee voices make it sound no more sultry than ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''</p>
        <p>Before the first Kidz Bop album made its debut in 2000, Billboard's Top Kid Audio chart was dominated by Disney soundtracks, fossilized oldies and acts like the Wiggles, an Australian combo known for its ultrabright costumes and songs like ''Rock-A-Bye Your Bear.'' Craig Balsam and Cliff Chenfeld, co-founders of Razor &amp; Tie, an entertainment company based in New York, thought that children's music producers were underserving an enormous segment of the market, the tweens -- too old for Barney the purple dinosaur, but too young to be scoping out Britney Spears's assets.</p>

        <p>BEYONCÉ'S ''Crazy in Love'' was last summer's inescapable Top 40 hit, booming nonstop from the Jersey Shore to northern Sweden. And even though it has long since faded from the charts, the tune is still raking in money -- albeit without Beyoncé belting out the chorus. As featured on ''Kidz Bop 5,'' a new CD, the song is performed by an anonymous crew of grade-school students, whose twee voices make it sound no more sultry than ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''</p>
        <p>Before the first Kidz Bop album made its debut in 2000, Billboard's Top Kid Audio chart was dominated by Disney soundtracks, fossilized oldies and acts like the Wiggles, an Australian combo known for its ultrabright costumes and songs like ''Rock-A-Bye Your Bear.'' Craig Balsam and Cliff Chenfeld, co-founders of Razor &amp; Tie, an entertainment company based in New York, thought that children's music producers were underserving an enormous segment of the market, the tweens -- too old for Barney the purple dinosaur, but too young to be scoping out Britney Spears's assets.</p>
        <p>Razor &amp; Tie's compromise was to rerecord Top 40 hits, using singers 5 to 12 years old in lieu of suggestive popsters. ''For some reason, kids like to hear other kids,'' said Mr. Balsam, a father of three. He speculates that children like to fantasize about performing the song, and that an adult voice complicates the daydream.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, the concept worked. The first four Kidz Bop installments, marketed mainly through low-budget ads on Nickelodeon, each sold more than 500,000 copies. ''Kidz Bop 4'' made its debut last August at No.14 on Billboard's Top 200 charts, and four of the top five best-selling children's albums in 2003 were Kidz Bop titles. Razor &amp; Tie has played off the brand's strength to sell a ''Kidz Bop Christmas'' album, a video called ''Everyone's a Star'' -- with the ever-popular believe-in-yourself theme -- and ''Kidz Bop Karaoke,'' a new singalong sold exclusively by Target stores.</p>
        <p>A big part of the series' appeal is the inoffensive content. ''We have a saying: kid-cool, parent-friendly,'' Mr. Balsam said, adding that songs were generally selected for their lack of saucy lyrics. On occasion, a line has to be bowdlerized. On ''Kidz Bop 3,'' a lyric from Shakira's ''Whenever Wherever'' was changed from ''Lucky that my breasts are small and humble'' to ''Lucky that my fears are small and humble.''</p>
        <p>According to Nielsen SoundScan, ''Kidz Bop 5,'' which is listed at $17.98 and includes reworkings of OutKast's ''Hey Ya'' and Nickelback's ''Someday,'' sold almost 230,000 copies from its February release through Wednesday. That is slightly behind the pace of its predecessor but still a strong performer for Razor &amp; Tie, a privately held company.</p>
        <p>The beauty of Kidz Bop, at least from a financial standpoint, is that the talent comes relatively cheap. The cast changes for each album, and none of the singers are credited in the liner notes. Though Mr. Balsam refuses to divulge how much he pays the Kidz Bop Kids, it's a safe bet that they earn far less than the Disney megastar Hilary Duff, a big rival on the charts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balsam also declined to reveal how much he paid the songs' authors in royalties, but he said, ''They're always happy to hear from us.'' Landing a hit on a Kidz Bop album, he said, is a good way to extend a song's revenue-producing cycle.</p>
        <p>Kidz Bop has already inspired a host of other efforts, from Rhino Records' ''Barbie Hit Mix'' to Disney's ''Superstar Kidz.''</p>
        <p>Last summer, Marketing Evaluations Inc., a company that measures the appeal of personalities and brands, tested 6- to 8-year-old girls to gauge their awareness of youth-oriented brands. Kidz Bop's score was equal to Coca-Cola's and Pepsi's, equal to or better than Pop-Tarts' and better than Burger King's. There is no word, however, on how Kidz Bop fared against Pepsi's star spokeswoman: Beyoncé.</p>
