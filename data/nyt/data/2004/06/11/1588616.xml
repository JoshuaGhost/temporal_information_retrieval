        <p>More than two million floor fans sold mostly at Home Depot stores have been recalled because of electrical problems that have caused fires, federal officials said. The distributor of the fans, the SMC Marketing Corporation of Grand Prairie, Tex., and Home Depot, based in Atlanta, announced the recall along with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The oscillating motion of the fans has damaged power cords on some of them, with the fans' plastic exteriors burning and melting. The recall includes 18-inch, pedestal fans with model number SR-18 or SP-18. The commission urged owners to return the fans to Home Depot for credit.</p>
