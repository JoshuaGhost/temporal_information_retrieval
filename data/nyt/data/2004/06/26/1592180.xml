        <p>Though most pianists tackle at least a good number of Beethoven's 32 sonatas, not many have all these diverse, challenging and extraordinary works in their active repertory at one time. To play the entire cycle takes resourceful technique, enormous musical intelligence and plenty of stamina as well as a willingness to immerse oneself whole in the music.</p>
        <p>That sense of total involvement was the most affecting quality of the recital the American pianist Jeffrey Swann gave on Thursday night at Bargemusic in Brooklyn, the first of eight recitals devoted to a complete survey of the Beethoven sonatas. The third and fourth will be tonight and tomorrow afternoon, with four more scheduled for mid-August.</p>

        <p>Though most pianists tackle at least a good number of Beethoven's 32 sonatas, not many have all these diverse, challenging and extraordinary works in their active repertory at one time. To play the entire cycle takes resourceful technique, enormous musical intelligence and plenty of stamina as well as a willingness to immerse oneself whole in the music.</p>
        <p>That sense of total involvement was the most affecting quality of the recital the American pianist Jeffrey Swann gave on Thursday night at Bargemusic in Brooklyn, the first of eight recitals devoted to a complete survey of the Beethoven sonatas. The third and fourth will be tonight and tomorrow afternoon, with four more scheduled for mid-August.</p>
        <p>The intensity of Mr. Swann's excitement over the music came through in his spoken introduction to the program, in which he proved an animated font of perceptive insights into the role of the piano in Beethoven's work and the composer's achievement in the sonata genre. One pertinent comment was that during most of Beethoven's life the piano sonata was mostly a genre for connoisseurs usually played in intimate, aristocratic settings.</p>
        <p>Concertos and symphonies were the public pieces. Beethoven turned the piano sonata into a genre of symphonic sweep and daring. Still, he mostly performed these works in the grandiose salons of dukes and such.</p>
        <p>The 125-seat converted barge docked near the Brooklyn Bridge that is the site of this inviting chamber music series is ideally intimate, though hardly grandiose. And its grand views of lower Manhattan through the windows behind the stage platform certainly lend grandeur to the ambience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swann has grouped the sonatas into subtitled programs. Thursday's was ''The Virtuoso Pianist,'' offering three works in which Beethoven boldly pushed piano technique to new realms. In Sonata No. 3 in C you can almost hear him saying to his teacher, Haydn, to whom he dedicated this work, ''I'll show you how to write a colossal piano sonata.'' This long, bold four-movement work exudes imagination and explores myriad challenging aspects of piano playing: trills, trills in thirds, scales, double-barreled octaves, broken chords, everything.</p>
        <p>Though here and there Mr. Swann scrambled a passage or faltered in his marksmanship, over all he gave an ebullient and gratifying account of this seldom-played work.</p>
        <p>Next came a formidable performance of a late period work, Sonata No. 28 in A, in which the virtuosic tests come especially from the entangled contrapuntal writing that runs through the music, not just the sprawling fugue in the final movement but curiously in the relentless and bracing march of the second movement, where one does not expect such polyphonic intricacies. Mr. Swann ended with a plucky account of Sonata No. 21 in C, the famous ''Waldstein,'' a work in which the virtuosic elements are the most overt and breathtaking.</p>
        <p>Tonight's program is titled ''The Grazioso Finale'' and tomorrow afternoon's ''The Grand Emotional Gesture,'' the latter culminating with the most daunting of all Beethoven sonatas, the ''Hammerklavier.''</p>
