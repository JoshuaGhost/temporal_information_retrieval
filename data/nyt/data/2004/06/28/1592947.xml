        <p>Before the Seattle Mariners traded Freddy Garcia to the Chicago White Sox yesterday, they called Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman to let him know they had a strong offer. A few hours later, the Mariners called again and said they were taking the White Sox' offer.</p>
        <p>The Mariners sent Garcia, one of the best pitchers available on the trade market, and catcher Ben Davis to Chicago for catcher Miguel Olivo; outfielder Jeremy Reed, an elite prospect; and another minor leaguer. Cashman said Seattle did not believe the Yankees could make a superior offer, and he agreed.</p>
        <p>''I'm very comfortable,'' he said. ''It's not like we had a situation where we lost out or let him slip through our hands. The White Sox put up an offer we couldn't match.''</p>
        <p>Cashman would not say what George Steinbrenner said about the trade, although Steinbrenner said yesterday that the Yankees had to improve their pitching. Pittsburgh's Kris Benson has been available for weeks. The Yankees would love to obtain Arizona's Randy Johnson, but it is unlikely the Diamondbacks will make him available, and Johnson has a no-trade clause.</p>
        <p>Instead of bemoaning Garcia's being scooped up by another team, Cashman spoke optimistically about Jos√© Contreras's revival and Kevin Brown's recovery from injury. Cashman, who said that Jon Lieber needed to regain some consistency, added that he was not close to trading for a pitcher. ''We're not in a situation, in my opinion, where we have to do anything,'' he said.</p>
