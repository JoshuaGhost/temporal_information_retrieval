        <p>A SWING around the perimeter of Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, once a drab mishmash of two-and three-story buildings dating back to the 1950's and 1960's, is these days a startling expedition. The 168-acre campus on the outskirts of the city is dotted with impressive brick and glass structures recently completed or under construction. Along a wire fence that surrounds a construction site is a huge plastic banner welcoming the school's new president, Cheryl J. Norton, the first female head in its nearly 111-year history.</p>
        <p>''The university has changed greatly,'' said William Cibes, chancellor of the Connecticut State University system, which oversees S.C.S.U. and Connecticut's three other higher-education facilities, Eastern, Western and Central state universities. ''If people think that Southern is still just a small university, then they haven't driven by lately.''</p>

        <p>A SWING around the perimeter of Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, once a drab mishmash of two-and three-story buildings dating back to the 1950's and 1960's, is these days a startling expedition. The 168-acre campus on the outskirts of the city is dotted with impressive brick and glass structures recently completed or under construction. Along a wire fence that surrounds a construction site is a huge plastic banner welcoming the school's new president, Cheryl J. Norton, the first female head in its nearly 111-year history.</p>
        <p>''The university has changed greatly,'' said William Cibes, chancellor of the Connecticut State University system, which oversees S.C.S.U. and Connecticut's three other higher-education facilities, Eastern, Western and Central state universities. ''If people think that Southern is still just a small university, then they haven't driven by lately.''</p>
        <p>Those who haven't visited the campus in years will be staggered by the dramatic changes: a $56 million appendage to an existing classroom building, a $29 million new residence hall and parking garage and a $23 million new energy facility, where the university's power is generated and monitored. A new $38 million student center is under construction and work is scheduled to begin soon on a $64 million addition and renovation that will double the size of the existing library. The total allocated to the construction to date is about $260 million.</p>
        <p>But the best is yet to come. University officials will soon approach the state legislature for $1 billion in state bonding funds to start the final phase of its master plan, approved in March by the S.C.S.U. board of trustees. The almost two-inch-thick formal request for state funding will lead to the completion in 2019 of the overhaul of the former New Haven State Teachers College on Fitch Street.</p>
        <p>Robert G. Sheeley, the associate vice president for capital budgeting and facilities operations at S.C.S.U., said the final phases of the master plan, which began in 1993, includes a $61 million academic building, a $63 million fine-arts center, a health and human services building and an addition to the School of Education costing $83 million, a $33 million administrative building and a $54 million communications and library-science building. Mr. Sheeley said S.C.S.U. student fees are paying for the construction of the student center, a massive building with a movie theater, ballroom, bookstore, food service and recreation space, that will be the cornerstone of the school's central mall, and the new residence hall and garage, for a total of about $61 million.</p>
        <p>Other construction will include an addition to the existing sports facility and a new 1,000-car garage, and more conference and meeting space throughout the campus. Design and other architectural work, along with testing, equipment and a host of other related preconstruction costs, will boost the total another $500 million to $1 billion by 2019.</p>
        <p>Southern's extreme makeover is part of the state university system's attempt to upgrade the campuses at all four of its public universities, Mr. Cibes said. ''The board of trustees recognized that there had not been much revitalization of the system since the 60's and 70's,'' he said. ''We needed to begin to focus on the real needs of our campuses and the future of our schools.'' Mr. Cibes said that about $100 million a year has been spent every year since 1995 upgrading the campuses, money that comes from the state's capital budget. The entire plan calls for about $3 billion in funding for all four schools.</p>
        <p>The S.C.S.U. transformation makes it a heady time for Ms. Norton, who replaced J. Philip Smith, who had served as interim president. Ms. Norton, the former provost at Metropolitan State College of Denver, said she is confident that managing the development of a large urban campus in Colorado, similar in many ways to S.C.S.U., has given her the skills she needs to take the New Haven university into the future.</p>
        <p>''I'm inheriting an exciting time,'' she said. ''I feel responsible not just for the enhancement of this campus, but also its educational enhancement. My job is to look five, 10, 15, 20 years out.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton's first visit to Southern wasn't quite as bracing as her goals, however. When she heard last summer that the university was looking for a new president, she and her husband made an anonymous trip from their vacation home in Madison to check out the campus on the outskirts of New Haven.</p>
        <p>''We got lost,'' Ms. Norton said. ''We finally had to stop at a gas station. The person said we had to go back 13 lights. The bottom line is there wasn't very good signage to indicate where Southern Connecticut was.''</p>
        <p>The oversight that Southern ''is not even on the bus map,'' said Ms. Norton, will be remedied this fall. As the university's new president since April 30, she and other school officials recently walked the campus to find locations to put up signs that would identify the school's boundaries. ''It's very hard to take pride in an institution and to talk in real terms about what it can accomplish if no one knows where you are,'' she said. ''This is very much symbolic.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton said that last summer's frustrating excursion has come to represent the aggressive public relations campaign she plans to undertake as the university continues to evolve from a ''teacher's college'' to a facility that is in the throes of the largest construction campaign in its history.</p>
        <p>''One of my primary goals is to try and ensure that what we do on our campus is well understood and respected in the community,'' said Ms. Norton while seated in her office overlooking a campus pond. ''At any point in time this institution has well over 12,000 students; 85 percent of our students who graduate work in the southern Connecticut area. We educate the workforce of this area, however, people don't necessarily recognize Southern for the contributions it makes. In that respect, I think we're a well-kept secret. It's my job to really ensure that the community understands that their future and our future are intertwined.''</p>
        <p>Michael Galbicsek, a 23-year-old graduate student who has attended S.C.S.U. since 1999, said he has seen just about every strand of the school improve in the last five years. ''When I first came to Southern, all of the offices were crowded and spread out,'' he said. ''Now, with the new buildings, everything is centralized. We have computers in the classrooms and there's teaching via the Internet. The school's cultural activities have improved; clubs on campus have tripled in the last five years. Our professors are getting more involved. There's no comparison to before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Galbicsek, a student member of S.C.S.U.'s board of trustees and a graduate intern for the vice president of student affairs, acknowledged that some area residents retain the ''old stereotype'' of S.C.S.U. being a second-tier state university that takes a back seat to the University of Connecticut in reputation and funding.</p>
        <p>''But they haven't seen what's going on here,'' he said. ''Once they see the new student center, they'll see it's no joke anymore.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Norton said she plans to dispel those lingering sentiments by implementing some new initiatives. ''There is no reason why our students should be valued less than any other student in higher education in the state of Connecticut,'' she said. ''I hope to develop the university so it is not just a college of opportunity, but a college of choice.'' Ms. Norton said she would visit every high school, and perhaps some middle schools, in the New Haven area whose students are potential S.C.S.U. applicants.</p>
        <p>''So many don't go on to higher education because they don't know much about it,'' she said. ''They often don't know how to begin. We need to break down those barriers.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Norton said she hopes to develop public-private partnerships and workforce initiatives similar to an accelerated nursing program she established at her former university in Denver.</p>
        <p>''People want to see the institution grow, change and evolve,'' Ms. Norton said. ''My vision of the institution coupled with the very dynamic facelift for the institution as well as some cosmetic changes I think will complement not only how the institution is seen in the community but its ability to actually educate the urban environment and the students that come here.''</p>
