        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am writing in response to your review of the new biography of Ted Williams (May 9).</p>
        <p>My father, Joe Williams, was one of the writers who treated Ted Williams poorly in print, but when I was working on my own baseball research, Ted consented to be interviewed anyway. I told him that in his refusal to defer to sportswriters he was simply ahead of his time; he said, ''No, no, I was just young and arrogant.'' He did admit, however, that he particularly disliked my father because he wore expensive suits and seemed ''real New York.'' Ted added that my father was ''real good-looking,'' and then looked straight at me.</p>
        <p>''Hell of a lot better-looking than you are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he said it with a smile.</p>
