        <p>H E MacRitchie letter holds that World War II veterans born in first part of 20th century receive hundreds of dollars less in Social Security annually than rest of veterans and nonveterans; contends that this can be corrected by simple acts of Senate and House, or by executive order</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Honor has been won by our veterans from each of the wars in my lifetime, as well as by my father and my husband's father, along with all the other noble men and women from World War I.</p>
        <p>Memorial Day services and the great new World War II Memorial in Washington have reminded us of the sacrifices made by the men and women in our services that give us the good lives we enjoy today.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Honor has been won by our veterans from each of the wars in my lifetime, as well as by my father and my husband's father, along with all the other noble men and women from World War I.</p>
        <p>Memorial Day services and the great new World War II Memorial in Washington have reminded us of the sacrifices made by the men and women in our services that give us the good lives we enjoy today.</p>
        <p>Many of the World War II veterans can be rewarded by simple acts of the Senate and the House of Representatives, or by executive order. All of them born in the ''notch'' years in the first part of the 20th century receive hundreds of dollars less in Social Security annually than the rest of veterans and nonveterans.</p>
        <p>Let's do something now, to show our gratitude before it's too late. For many a hero, it is already too late.</p>
