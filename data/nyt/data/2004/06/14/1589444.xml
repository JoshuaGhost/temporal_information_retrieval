        <p>Annika Sorenstam called her morning round in Sunday's 36-hole finale of the L.P.G.A. Championship ''one of the rounds I'll remember forever.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam's afternoon round at DuPont Country Club nearly turned into one she would love to forget.</p>
        <p>But after watching a seemingly insurmountable seven-shot lead whittled to two strokes by Shi Hyun Ahn, a 19-year-old Tour rookie, Sorenstam was able to right herself by making four birdies from the 12th through the 17th holes.</p>
        <p>''That, I'm going to remember for a long time,'' said Sorenstam, who shot a closing one-over-par 72 to hold off Ahn by three strokes.</p>
        <p>And then there was the shot on the 16th hole -- the 54-degree sand wedge from 90 yards that Sorenstam chipped from the 11th fairway over trees and a greenside bunker to within 3 feet of the cup.</p>
        <p>''This shot I'm going to remember for a long time, too,'' said Sorenstam, who tapped home for the birdie that put Ahn away.</p>
        <p>By winning her second consecutive L.P.G.A. Championship with a four-round total of 13-under 271, Sorenstam won her seventh major.</p>
        <p>With her 52nd career victory, the 33-year-old Sorenstam joined Juli Inkster, Patty Sheehan and Mickey Wright as the only repeat winners of this tournament.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people say I'm robotic -- down the fairway, down the green -- and it's not true,'' Sorenstam said. ''I've learned how to scramble.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam's afternoon round was only the second this year that she finished over par. Her morning round -- a bogey-free 64 -- was nearly flawless.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam's 14-under 199 in the first three rounds broke Karrie Webb's 54-hole tournament record of 201, set here in 2001. And so Sorenstam, who had led by one stroke after two rounds, took a six-stroke lead into the final round.</p>
        <p>Through the first three rounds, Sorenstam made a grand total of three bogeys. All she needed to do in the final round was shoot 68 or better to break Inkster's tournament scoring record of 268, which Inkster, who played in Sorenstam's grouping Sunday, set in 1999. If she shot a 69 or better, Sorenstam would become the only player in this year's field to shoot in the 60's in all four rounds.</p>
        <p>But Sorenstam made five bogeys and one double bogey in the final round.</p>
        <p>The par-5 ninth hole almost cost her the tournament. During her morning round, Sorenstam's tee shot caught the trees as she attempted to cut the corner on the dogleg right.</p>
        <p>But instead of finding the creek, Sorenstam's ball dropped straight down into the rough, where she had a clear look at the fairway. Instead of bogey, Sorenstam made birdie.</p>
        <p>''To walk off with a birdie there, I felt like a thief,'' Sorenstam said between rounds.</p>
        <p>She did not feel nearly so fortunate on the ninth hole during her afternoon round. Playing it safer this time, Sorenstam hit a fairway wood off the tee into the middle of the fairway, then laid up with her second shot.</p>
        <p>But Jennifer Rosales, the first-round leader, who was playing with Sorenstam and Inkster on Sunday, had to wait for a ruling on where she could drop her ball because her drive had clipped a tree, bounced off a bridge and sunk into the creek.</p>
        <p>During the delay, Sorenstam retreated behind a tree farther up the right rough lining the fairway, on the far side of the creek, where she sat on her bag and waited for the ruling. When Rosales finally shot, she hit another tree. The carom nearly hit Sorenstam, which, several onlookers said, was the only way anyone could remove Sorenstam from the lead.</p>
        <p>''That had nothing to do with my seven on that hole,'' Sorenstam said later, even though she began to play as if she had been shaken up. Her approach shot bounced over the green and into the rough. Sorenstam clunked a lob shot into more rough, then chipped to within 7 feet of the cup. She missed her first putt right, then tapped in for a double bogey.</p>
        <p>''To walk away with seven, it kind of rattled me there,'' Sorenstam said.</p>
        <p>Suddenly vulnerable, and with her putter now failing her, Sorenstam bogeyed the 10th and 11th holes. She was now at 10 under. The seven-stroke lead she had taken to the ninth hole was down to two, and Grace Park, who won the first major on the Tour this year, the Nabisco championship, was starting to make a charge, along with Ahn.</p>
        <p>So when Sorenstam rolled in a 40-foot putt for birdie on the par-4 12th hole to move back to 11 under for a three-stroke lead with six holes to play, her reaction was understandable. As she walked up to the cup to retrieve her ball, Sorenstam put her right hand over her heart and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>''That's when I told my caddie, 'It's going to be O.K.,''' Sorenstam said.</p>
        <p>She held Ahn at bay by sinking a 25-foot putt from the fringe for birdie on No. 14. Sorenstam then put Ahn away by making birdie on the par-5 16th, which Sorenstam played down the 11th fairway after an errant tee shot.</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Hyun Shi Ahn shot a bogey-free 66 for the lowest score of the final round to finish second with a 10-under-par total of 274. Grace Park shot a final-round 68 to finish third at 276.</p>
