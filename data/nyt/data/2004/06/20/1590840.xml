        <p>Golden Hill Paugussett Indians reportedly will appeal Bureau of Indian Affairs ruling denying them federal recognition and chance to open casino in Bridgeport, Conn; state Attorney Gen Richard Blumenthal supports bureau's decision (S)</p>

        <p>A lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugussett Indians said last week that they would appeal a ruling by the Bureau of Indian Affairs that denied them federal recognition -- and the chance to take steps to open a casino. The decision was based on what the bureau said was a failure to prove a link to the original Golden Hill or Turkey Hill Indians of the Bridgeport area.</p>
        <p>Michael D. O'Connell, a lawyer from Hartford, said the tribe would appeal to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, which forced the Bureau of Indian Affairs to review similar decisions in 1996 and 1998.</p>

        <p>A lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugussett Indians said last week that they would appeal a ruling by the Bureau of Indian Affairs that denied them federal recognition -- and the chance to take steps to open a casino. The decision was based on what the bureau said was a failure to prove a link to the original Golden Hill or Turkey Hill Indians of the Bridgeport area.</p>
        <p>Michael D. O'Connell, a lawyer from Hartford, said the tribe would appeal to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals, which forced the Bureau of Indian Affairs to review similar decisions in 1996 and 1998.</p>
        <p>''While we certainly are disappointed in the decision, it is not the end of the process,'' Mr. O'Connell said. ''The appellate administrative appeals process is one that from our experience holds the promise of a serious review of what we think are some gaps in the analysis and rational of the B.I.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connell said the Paugussetts have been recognized by the state since the 1970's. He said eastern tribes like the Paugussetts are at a disadvantage proving their genealogy.</p>
        <p>''Because the process of assimilation took place at an earlier stage than it did with the western tribes, the eastern tribes have a difficult task in providing consistent documentation for all the time periods of their existence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, said the state would oppose any appeal by the Paugussetts regarding federal recognition.</p>
        <p>''The decision was absolutely correct,'' he said. ''The surprise is that the recognition petition was taken seriously for almost two decades and consumed so much time energy and resources. It was completely without merit, bordering on frivolous.''</p>
