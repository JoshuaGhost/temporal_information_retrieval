        <p>THE new owners of the Metropolitan Hotel at Lexington Avenue and 51st Street are changing plenty: the lobby, the bar, a restaurant, all 755 guest rooms and even the name.</p>
        <p>But one thing they are not changing is what made the hotel an object of contempt when it was built: the Art Deco exterior, with its curved sea-foam-blue facade and a sign straight out of ''The Jetsons.'' Though derided at the time, the design, more typical of hotels in Miami Beach and Las Vegas, has since been recognized as a valid alternative to the austere glass and steel boxes that were the height of architectural fashion when the property first opened in 1961.</p>

        <p>THE new owners of the Metropolitan Hotel at Lexington Avenue and 51st Street are changing plenty: the lobby, the bar, a restaurant, all 755 guest rooms and even the name.</p>
        <p>But one thing they are not changing is what made the hotel an object of contempt when it was built: the Art Deco exterior, with its curved sea-foam-blue facade and a sign straight out of ''The Jetsons.'' Though derided at the time, the design, more typical of hotels in Miami Beach and Las Vegas, has since been recognized as a valid alternative to the austere glass and steel boxes that were the height of architectural fashion when the property first opened in 1961.</p>
        <p>The hotel, formerly affiliated with Loews, was bought about a year ago by an investment group that includes Highgate Holding of Dallas, Oxford Capital Group of Chicago and the Whitehall Street fund of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the group paid $122 million, or $166,667 a room. That price is looking like a bargain, the report implied, even though the group is investing an additional $35 million for renovations to bring it up to contemporary standards.</p>
        <p>Some hotels sold about the same time went for much higher per-room prices. The Doral Park Avenue, for example, sold for $278,049 a room and the Helmsley Windsor fetched $235,537 for each room.</p>
        <p>The renovation, to be finished by autumn, comes at a time that business and leisure travelers are returning to New York, increasing occupancy rates and allowing hotel operators to regain more control of their properties from the Internet sales operations that flourished after the 9/11 attacks.</p>
        <p>''We have had a good spring -- the business travelers are back,'' said Cheryl Boyer, leader of PricewaterhouseCooper's New York area hospitality practice. She said the firm was expecting the occupancy rate to increase to 82 percent this year, compared with 75.8 percent in 2003.</p>
        <p>Along with this increase in occupancy, revenue per available room -- a key hotel industry financial indicator -- is expected to increase this year to $152, up from an average of $132 last year.</p>
        <p>The group's agreement to buy the hotel was reached in early 2003 -- the closing took place in July -- before the recovery in business and tourism became obvious. That made the timing excellent for the buyers, said John W. Rutledge, president of Oxford Capital. ''We had done a rigorous analysis of the New York City market over 35 years,'' he said. ''And we found that it always comes back and comes back stronger.''</p>
        <p>The fact that the hotel, which is on a stretch of Lexington Avenue that includes the Waldorf-Astoria, W, Marriott East Side and Intercontinental hotels, was in need of renovation made it even more attractive.</p>
        <p>''We like to buy the tiredest house on the best street,'' he said. ''That's what we did when we bought the Lexington at 48th Street in 1999.'' That hotel is now known as the Radisson Lexington Hotel.</p>
        <p>THE Metropolitan will also add a national affiliation with Doubletree, a Hilton brand, and be known as the Doubletree Metropolitan.</p>
        <p>Although Doubletree is largely known for its suburban locations, Hilton has been broadening the chain's approach and applying it to urban locations, Mr. Rutledge said. ''They want it to be a little more contemporary and a little more stylish and apply it to larger, urban properties,'' he said. ''Historically, it was in the suburbs and at airports.''</p>
        <p>He said the hotel would benefit from its proximity to the Waldorf-Astoria at 50th Street, which is also a Hilton property. ''There will be a symbiotic relationship with the Waldorf,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan was nothing if not stylish when it opened as the Summit. It was designed by the architect Morris Lapidus, whose buildings were denounced by contemporary architecture critics in terms like ''emblems of tail-fin chic'' and ''the nation's grossest national product.''</p>
        <p>In an interview not long before his death in 2001, Lapidus said of the Summit, ''It was the most hated hotel in New York.'' But he said he was designing to appeal to the fantasies of vacationers and tried to make his hotels look like movie sets. He said the design of the hotel was largely dictated by zoning and other city regulations.</p>
        <p>Executives of the hotel say the Doubletree affiliation will give them the benefit of a national marketing organization and the advantage of Hilton's frequent visitor loyalty program.</p>
        <p>Although some hotels shut down briefly to renovate, the Metropolitan is doing it on the fly, with about 250 guest rooms undergoing refitting while about 500 remain in operation. The renovation will actually increase the room count to 755 from 732 by dividing some of the larger spaces.</p>
        <p>Guest rooms, though not large, are being equipped as would be expected for a modern business class hotel, with high-speed Internet, flat-screen televisions, multiple telephones and polished stone in bathrooms.</p>
        <p>In addition to the standard rooms, there are larger rooms called junior suites and, on the 18th floor, rooms with usable balconies overlooking 51st Street. There will be only one smoking floor, the 15th.</p>
        <p>RONALD G. DRAKE, the vice president for sales and marketing for the Metropolitan and Radisson Lexington hotels, said the lobby and bar on the first floor are being redone in a way that will be a modern version of Lapidus's design, including eggshell-shaped seats on the bar stools.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the glass-walled penthouse on the 20th floor will be remodeled. The space, which is divided into two parts, each with a large outdoor patio, will be used for social events like weddings and corporate functions. When the changes are complete, the hotel will be marketed more strongly to business travelers and less to the low-budget tour groups that predominated in the later years of the Loews operation.</p>
        <p>That, he said, will allow managers to increase base rates to about $250 a night, with $50 more for a junior suite and $50 more for a suite with a balcony. According to some Internet sites, rooms at the hotel can now be booked for about $140 a night.</p>
