        <p>'Tasting Memories'  The Neighborhood Playhouse</p>
        <p>Kitty Carlisle Hart really is 93, but that's hard to believe when she stands up and sings Irving Berlin's ''Let's Have Another Cup o' Coffee'' and William Bolcom's ''Lime Jell-O Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise.'' Her delicate voice seems more fragile than frail, and her face reflects the delight of a little girl who knows she's pleasing the grown-ups. That's a quality hard not to love.</p>
        <p>The Colleagues Theater Company's ''Tasting Memories'' is a one-act reading (with a little music) of poetry and prose about food. It is performed by a rotating cast of Broadway notables of a certain age, including Mrs. Hart, Rosemary Harris, Philip Bosco, Tammy Grimes, Alvin Epstein, Richard Easton, Kathleen Noone and the team who compiled the material, Michael Fischetti and Emily Mitchell.</p>
        <p>The sources are admirable, among them Shakespeare, Hemingway, Pablo Neruda, Edna St. Vincent Millay, M. F. K. Fisher and of course Proust, with his madeleines. But the cast alternately phones it in and overemotes.</p>
        <p>Happily the show, directed by Don Amendolia and playing through Sunday at 340 East 54th Street, Manhattan, has its moments, and not only Mrs. Hart's. Mr. Epstein quotes Somerset Maugham (''To eat well in England, you should have breakfast three times a day'') and Julia Child (''Whenever you see food beautifully arranged on a plate, you know someone's fingers have been all over it''). Lewis Carroll's ''Walrus and the Carpenter,'' performed by Ms. Grimes, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Bosco at the performance I attended, is as charming as ever. It's part of a four-part salute to oysters.</p>
        <p>New York stages have turned oddly gastronomic recently, with ''Chef's Theater,'' ''Dinner With Demons'' and ''The Last Supper.'' This company, founded partly to create opportunities for older actors, seems to have jumped on the bandwagon.</p>
