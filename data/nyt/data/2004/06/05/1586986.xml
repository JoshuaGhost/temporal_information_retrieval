        <p>On a night when the Yankees launched six home runs and heard their fans cheer a three-run homer by a visitor, Joe Torre might have pulled off the most unlikely feat of all. Torre, the Yankees' manager, got Derek Jeter to admit he was hurt.</p>
        <p>Jeter left the Yankees' 7-6 victory over the Texas Rangers in the fourth inning, giving in to tightness in his left groin. Torre said he expected Jeter to miss the next two games, and he also doubted that Enrique Wilson would play today. Wilson, who homered and made a crucial play at shortstop last night, pulled his groin in the eighth inning.</p>

        <p>On a night when the Yankees launched six home runs and heard their fans cheer a three-run homer by a visitor, Joe Torre might have pulled off the most unlikely feat of all. Torre, the Yankees' manager, got Derek Jeter to admit he was hurt.</p>
        <p>Jeter left the Yankees' 7-6 victory over the Texas Rangers in the fourth inning, giving in to tightness in his left groin. Torre said he expected Jeter to miss the next two games, and he also doubted that Enrique Wilson would play today. Wilson, who homered and made a crucial play at shortstop last night, pulled his groin in the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>Miguel Cairo and Homer Bush will be the likely middle-infield duo, Torre said, with Alex Rodriguez staying at third base. ''This is a short-term thing, and I don't really want to mess up what he's got going for him right now,'' Torre said of Rodriguez.</p>
        <p>The way things are going for the Yankees, those injuries may not make much of a difference. They won for the 10th time in their last 11 games, and won after trailing by four runs for the fifth time this season. They did not do that once last year.</p>
        <p>Alfonso Soriano noticed an obvious difference in the Yankees, who shipped him to Texas for Rodriguez in February. Soriano, who was cheered by at least half the crowd after hitting a three-run homer in the third inning, admired the Yankees' sluggers.</p>
        <p>''They have more power,'' Soriano said. ''They have more offense and pitching. They're playing very well.''</p>
        <p>Soriano was making his first appearance at Yankee Stadium since the trade, and the fans gave him a standing ovation on his way to the plate in the top of the first inning. As he dug at the dirt in the batter's box, he lifted his helmet in appreciation. Later, when he took the field, the bleacher fans saluted him by chanting his name.</p>
        <p>''It made me so happy,'' Soriano said. ''The people, they always support me, no matter what team I play for.''</p>
        <p>Soriano lined a homer to right-center field off Kevin Brown in the third, and many fans stood again and clapped. Soriano noticed.</p>
        <p>''It was, like, 50-50,'' he said. ''A lot of people, maybe they're not happy I hit a home run. But I have to do my job.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees did theirs, too, coming back after Mark Teixeira's homer put them in a 4-0 hole. Bernie Williams bashed a two-run homer off Kenny Rogers in the third, and Wilson, Rodriguez and Gary Sheffield thumped homers in the fourth. Hideki Matsui's fifth-inning blast chased Rogers, the former Yankee who has a 5.48 career earned run average in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Sheffield was fighting a stomach bug, passed around his house from his son to his wife to him, and he was discouraged by his weak swings in batting practice. He asked Torre to use him at designated hitter last night.</p>
        <p>''It kind of affects me when I run,'' Sheffield said. ''When you're jumping up and down, you get a little dizzy. I'm glad I didn't have to run the bases.''</p>
        <p>Trotting felt fine. Facing reliever Jay Powell in the sixth inning after the Rangers had tied the score off Brown, Sheffield drilled another homer over the wall in left-center, putting the Yankees ahead for good.</p>
        <p>''It just goes to show you that all through our lineup, the pitchers can't go out and rest,'' Sheffield said. ''When Enrique goes deep and you turn the lineup over to Jeter, you can't rest on him because he can do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the game, both those players were ailing. Wilson ranged well past second base to stab an inning-ending grounder in the seventh, but he hurt himself crossing first base on a groundout in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Jeter first injured his groin Thursday, scoring from first on a double by Sheffield. Jeter stayed in to finish that game, and Torre let him start last night. But he told him to speak up if he felt any pain.</p>
        <p>After beating out an infield single in the third inning, Jeter told Torre that he felt the same tightness in his groin.</p>
        <p>''Groins are something you don't want to mess around with,'' Jeter said. ''We're just trying to be smart with it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Closer MARIANO RIVERA pitched in his fourth game in a row last night, and Manager JOE TORRE said he would not pitch today. TOM GORDON, who rested last night because PAUL QUANTRILL worked two innings, will be the closer. . . . JASON GIAMBI said he would return from the disabled list tomorrow and start at first base. Giambi, who sprained his right ankle on May 21, said he did not receive treatment for his hip, back and knee injuries while on the D.L. ''I didn't need to,'' Giambi said. ''I was good.'' . . . Reliever STEVE KARSAY threw three innings yesterday in Tampa, Fla., in his third extended spring training game. Torre said Karsay could return within a few weeks, helping to ease the burden on Quantrill in middle relief.</p>
