        <p>While United States commanders worked out a new cease-fire in southern Iraq on Friday, five American soldiers were killed in an attack on their convoy in eastern Baghdad, the United States military said.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said the convoy was first hit by a bomb planted alongside the road. When the vehicles stopped, gunmen sprayed the soldiers with machine gun fire. Five soldiers were wounded in the attack.</p>
        <p>In the flash point city of Najaf, Moktada al-Sadr, the rebel Shiite cleric, agreed to the second truce in about a month, according to Iraqi officials. Both sides promised to withdraw their soldiers from the city center and turn over security to the local police.</p>
        <p>''All the warring parties, the coalition forces and the Mahdi Army militias should leave the two holy cities,'' the governor of Najaf, Adnan Zurfi said, referring to Najaf and nearby Kufa.</p>
        <p>He also said the two sides ''should not allow any of their members to enter again.''</p>
        <p>A similar deal was fashioned last month but soon collapsed into gun battles and ambushes.</p>
        <p>Still, an American commander said the agreement on Friday was a ''breakthrough.''</p>
        <p>''I'd really classify this as a breakthrough day,'' Col. Brad May told CNN. ''What we're seeing is the governor taking control of the whole city, and he now feels that he does have sufficient police forces to move into those areas that need the security.''</p>
        <p>The deal made scant mention of the fate of Mr. Sadr himself. The capture of Mr. Sadr, who is accused of planning the murder of a rival imam, was one of the reasons American forces started the fighting, which is estimated to have cost more than 500 lives.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Sadr has not tempered his message. On Friday, he issued a statement, read at prayer time in a Kufa mosque, blasting the new interim Iraqi government selected this week.</p>
        <p>''I do not want to have anything to do with this government,'' he read. ''I don't believe any Iraqi would accept this appointment of a government by the occupier.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sadr is the son of a famous Shiite cleric who was assassinated by Saddam Hussein's henchmen. Mr. Sadr launched the most serious uprising of the occupation in April, after American authorities shut down his newspaper because they said it was printing anti-American lies.</p>
        <p>According to the peace deal, Mr. Sadr's militia, a black-clad group that calls itself the Mahdi Army, will disarm once local police officers move in. The deal was supposed to take effect at 6 p.m. on Friday.</p>
        <p>However, even after the 6 p.m. deadline came and went, local reporters said several Mahdi fighters were standing around a Najaf mosque, insisting no one had told them anything about leaving.</p>
        <p>American commanders agreed to support the Najaf police if necessary but only from bases outside the two cities.</p>
        <p>The Najaf governor, Mr. Zurfi, praised the peace plan but said it was important for American officials to continue the gun buyback program they started last month to get weapons off the street. He also said the trial of Mr. Sadr was a ''national issue,'' meaning that his case should be handled by Iraqi authorities, not American.</p>
        <p>The Shiite House, a group of Shiite political leaders, approved the deal, saying it was the fruit of a tough week of negotiations between Shiite religious leaders, Mr. Sadr's militiamen, Najaf politicians and American officials.</p>
        <p>At least five of the casualties in the Baghdad convoy attack on Friday -- two of the dead and three of the wounded -- have been identified as members of the New Jersey National Guard, according to the office of Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey. The men were not named pending notification of their families. Flags flew at half-staff at the Guard armories in West Orange and Westfield.</p>
