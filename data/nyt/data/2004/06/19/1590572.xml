        <p>LOS ANGELES, June 18 Â— The sudden emergence of Bret Prinz in the Yankees' bullpen made the left-hander Gabe White expendable, and the Yankees traded White on Friday to the Cincinnati Reds for the minor league left-hander Charlie Manning.</p>

        <p>The sudden emergence of Bret Prinz in the Yankees' bullpen made the left-hander Gabe White expendable, and the Yankees traded White on Friday to the Cincinnati Reds for the minor league left-hander Charlie Manning.</p>
        <p>The Yankees also included $700,000 in the deal. They will pay $200,000 more if the Reds decline White's 2005 option; if the Reds pick up the option, the Yankees will send them a minor leaguer.</p>
        <p>White had an 8.27 earned run average in 24 appearances, and opponents have hit .355 against him. The move allows the Yankees to fit the left-hander Brad Halsey into their 40-man roster in time for Halsey's major league debut at Dodger Stadium on Saturday. General Manager Brian Cashman said the performance of Prinz, a right-hander, inspired the deal. Prinz has a 2.92 E.R.A. in 10 games.</p>
        <p>''Prinz has done so well that despite being a right-hander, he's moved ahead of Gabe as someone we have confidence going out there for us,'' Cashman said. ''The more Gabe struggled, the less opportunity he had to work out of it.''</p>
        <p>White, who came to the Yankees in a trade from Cincinnati last July 31, said he suffered from inactivity, but he said he did not blame Manager Joe Torre. ''There's just limited work,'' White said.</p>
