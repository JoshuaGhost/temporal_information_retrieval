        <p>A second round of voting will be held this month after no candidate won a clear majority on Sunday. The front-runner was Valdas Adamkus, 77, who returned from the United States and served as president between 1998 and 2003. He will oppose Kazimira Prunskiene, the first post-Soviet prime minister, who has the backing of Rolandas Paksas, who was removed from the presidency in April on corruption charges but remains popular. The impeachment has thrown Lithuania into political turmoil as it prepares to join the European Union next month.</p>
