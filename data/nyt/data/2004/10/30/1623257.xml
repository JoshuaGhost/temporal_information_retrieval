        <p>The Breeders' Cup is making its first trip to Texas, where the weather is expected to be sunny and relatively mild (78 degrees), and where the horses will be blazing today, when eight championship races are held. The forecasts for the eight races are provided by Bill Finley, with the horses in the Classic, the day's marquee race, listed in the predicted order of finish. The morning-line odds were set by Rick Lee, the handicapper for Lone Star Park.</p>
        <p>BREEDERS' CUP CLASSIC  Purse: $4 million Distance: 11.4 miles  Post time: 5:35 p.m. Eastern Television: NBC</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 1. Ghostzapper  TRAINER: Bobby Frankel  JOCKEY: Javier Castellano  ODDS: 3-1  Has posted some of the fastest speed figures in history while winning slightly shorter races. If he can relax early, it's all over.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 12. Pleasantly Perfect  TRAINER: Richard Mandella  JOCKEY: Jerry Bailey  ODDS: 5-2  Last year's Classic champ has had another solid year and is said to be thriving here in Texas. Can he be ready after a 10-week layoff?</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 7. Birdstone  TRAINER: Nick Zito  JOCKEY: Edgar Prado  ODDS: 6-1  A tough little 3-year-old who is the only horse to beat Smarty Jones. Backed up his Belmont upset with a Travers victory, but has never faced older horses.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 9. Funny Cide  TRAINER: Barclay Tagg  JOCKEY: Jose Santos  ODDS: 6-1  Will certainly run better than last year, when he was ninth, but hasn't beaten horses of this caliber all year. Victory in Gold Cup came at expense of weak field.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 4. Perfect Drift  TRAINER: Murray Johnson  JOCKEY: Kent Desormeaux  ODDS: 15-1  Making his third straight Classic appearance, he was sixth in 2003 and 12th in 2002. Hasn't run a bad race in 2004 on dirt, but is 0 for 7 on the year.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 6. Roses in May  TRAINER: Dale Romans  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  ODDS: 5-1  Speedy colt is 5 for 5 this year, but this is by far his toughest test and he will not get an easy trip with the front-runner Ghostzapper breaking inside of him.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 3. Azeri  TRAINER: D. Wayne Lukas  JOCKEY: Pat Day  ODDS: 15-1  A marvelous mare, but this isn't where she belongs. She was badly beaten once this year (in the Met Mile) versus males. Why try again?</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 13. Dynever  TRAINER: Christophe Clement  JOCKEY: Corey Nakatani  ODDS: 15-1  His only victory this year came in Grade III company. Doesn't have the class to win this.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 10. Newfoundland  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: Eibar Coa  ODDS: 20-1  Gave Funny Cide a tussle when second in the Gold Cup, but that's about as good as it gets for a $3.3 million yearling who has never won better than a Grade III race.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 5. Fantasticat  TRAINER: Bobby Barnett  JOCKEY: Gerard Melancon  ODDS: 50-1  Ran the race of his life to beat a weak field in the Super Derby and would have to improve a dozen lengths off that to be competitive here.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 11. Bowman's Band  TRAINER: H. Allen Jerkens  JOCKEY: Cornelio Velasquez  ODDS: 50-1  Jerkens has pulled off some amazing upsets in his Hall of Fame career, but this is beyond his powers. Horse has lost 12 straight and doesn't belong here.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 2. Freefourinternet  TRAINER: Michael Maker  JOCKEY: Greta Kuntzweiler  ODDS: 50-1  Ambitiously placed 6-year-old upset Perfect Drift in the Hawthorne Gold Cup, but is facing a much harder assignment here.</p>
        <p>POST/HORSE: 8. Personal Rush  TRAINER: Kenji Yamauchi  JOCKEY: Frankie Dettori  ODDS: 50-1  Kentucky-bred colt has won two straight on the dirt, but has been running at second-tier tracks in Japan. Has come a long way just to finish well up the track.</p>
        <p>DISTAFF  Fillies and mares, 1 1/8 miles, $2 million, 3-year-olds and up.  Post time: 1:20 p.m.  Island Fashion (5-1) ran second versus males in the Santa Anita Handicap before getting sick and taking an ill-advised trip to Japan. She has had a useful prep for the Distaff and should finally be back on her game. Ashado (7-2) is solid. Storm Flag Flying (9-2) is classy, but has yet to post a top speed figure this year.  LONG SHOT: Nebraska Tornado (15-1) has never tried the dirt, but was bred to love the surface and is in the hands of the crafty French trainer Andre Fabre.</p>
        <p>JUVENILE FILLIES  2-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles, $1 million.  Post time: 1:55 p.m.  Culinary (12-1) could be pretty special. She has romped in her two career starts and beat Runway Model last time. That filly came back to beat a stellar field in the Alcibiades. Balletto (5-1) drew well (post 1) and has improved with each start. She showed her class when winning the Grade I Frizette. Sense of Style (7-2) deserves another chance after a rough trip in the Alcibiades.  LONG SHOT: Mona Lisa (15-1) was beaten just one and three-quarter lengths in Group I company in England. Not out of this if she can handle the dirt.</p>
        <p>MILE  1 mile on turf, $1.5 million, 3-year-olds and up.  Post time: 2:35 p.m.  Special Ring (9-2) has run only once this year and not since July, but his trainer, Julio Canani, has won this race twice and is a master at getting them ready for big events. Whipper (8-1) has had a solid season in Europe, where he beat the 2003 Mile winner Six Perfections in the Prix Jacques le Marois. Artie Schiller (12-1) does nothing wrong, and he might be ready for older horses.  LONG SHOT: Blackdoun (20-1) seems generously priced in the morning line considering he is 3 for 3 in the United States.</p>
        <p>SPRINT  Six furlongs, $1 million, 3-year-olds and up.  Post: 3:10 p.m.  In a difficult race to decipher, Kela (8-1) gets the nod. He has developed into the best sprinter in the West and should get the fast pace he needs to set up his late run. Midas Eyes (7-2) returned to peak form at Saratoga for his trainer, Bobby Frankel, who is 2 for 57 in the Breeders' Cup. Speightstown (3-1) threw in a clinker in the Vosburgh. Can he bounce back?  LONG SHOT: Gold Storm (15-1) has the hometrack advantage and tremendous early speed.</p>
        <p>FILLY &amp; MARE TURF  1 3/8 miles, $1 million, 3-year-olds and up.  Post time: 3:45 p.m.  Ouija Board (8-5) should have no problem with this field if maintaining her form. She turned in a super effort last time when third versus males in the Arc de Triomphe. Wonder Again (8-1) never fired in the Flower Bowl. She is a much better mare than that. Light Jig (7-2) beat California's best grass fillies and mares in the Yellow Ribbon.  LONG SHOT Risk Averse (12-1) took a long time to get going this year, but never looked better than when winning the Flower Bowl.</p>
        <p>JUVENILE  1 1/16 miles, $1.5 million, 2-year-old colts.  Post time: 4:20 p.m.  Proud Accolade (5-2) improved when trying a route for the first time in the Champagne. In what looks like a two-horse race, he must prove he is better than Roman Ruler (8-5), who is 3 for 4 and won the Norfolk in ridiculously easy fashion. Sun King (8-1) was a good third in the Champagne and will improve.  LONG SHOT: Hard to see a long shot winning this race, but the erratic Consolidator (8-1) is trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who has won this race five times.</p>
        <p>TURF  1 1/2 miles, $2 million, 3-year-olds and up.  Post time: 4:55 p.m.  Kitten's Joy (1-1) looks like the most likely winner on the day. He has dominated American competition and faces only one newcomer from Europe, Powerscourt (3-1). Powerscourt is far from Europe's best, but he managed to cross the wire first in the Arlington Million before being disqualified. Magistretti (4-1) was no match for Kitten's Joy in the Joe Hirsch Turf Invitational but is good enough to finish among the top three.  LONG SHOT: Star Over The Bay 10-1) is a former claimer who got hot at the right time. He has won three straight.</p>
