        <p>She received a bachelor's degree in history from Manhattanville College in 1962 and a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Detroit in 1968.</p>
        <p>After teaching math at a Sacred Heart school in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she became head of the middle school of the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich, Conn. She was then headmistress for 10 years, starting in 1970.</p>
        <p>In 1980, she became headmistress in New York. After retiring in 2000, she was a mentor to novice nuns in Chicago.</p>
