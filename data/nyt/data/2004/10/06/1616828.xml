        <p>Alu Alkhanov, the Kremlin's latest hope for stabilizing its foundering strategy in the Caucasus, was sworn into office here on Tuesday as president of Chechnya, taking control of the government of a republic with its infrastructure in ruins and its nights racked by lawlessness and terror.</p>
        <p>The ceremony took place on the first day of what is supposed to be a four-year term. Of all the difficult tasks ahead -- and there are many -- Mr. Alkhanov's chief chore may be to stay alive.</p>
        <p>''We have a motherland: Russia,'' he said, choosing a message loathed by the separatist rebels who assassinated his predecessor. ''We have a cause: prosperity. God help us.''</p>
        <p>The inauguration was uneventful and swift, held behind rings of security on the grounds of the capital's heavily fortified government complex, which has been renovated after nearly being destroyed two years ago by a truck bomb.</p>
        <p>With gunmen frisking guests and a spaniel sniffing for explosives at the entrance to the tent in which the ceremony took place, Mr. Alkhanov sounded notes of fresh commitment to restore order in a corner of Russia that has endured a decade of violence and physical destruction.</p>
        <p>''Much has been done,'' he said. ''We have to do much more.''</p>
        <p>He also suggested an intention to work more closely with human rights groups, the most unrelenting critics of the Kremlin's policy for Chechnya.</p>
        <p>A band played. Children in traditional garb wished him well. The state mufti offered a prayer. Then Mr. Alkhanov slipped away in a black Mercedes-Benz sedan, beginning what can only be described as one of the world's most unsavory jobs.</p>
        <p>The Chechen presidency became available in May when the previous president, Akhmad Kadyrov, was killed by a bomb hidden in a stadium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alkhanov, 47, was formerly Chechnya's top law enforcement officer and, like his predecessor, is the Kremlin's man.</p>
        <p>He emphasized that allegiance in his remarks Tuesday, quoting President Vladimir V. Putin and proclaiming that terrorist acts emanating from Chechnya cannot be stopped without close cooperation between the republic and Moscow.</p>
        <p>Since June, when Mr. Alkhanov announced his candidacy, he has become one of the Kremlin's most reliable messengers. He has said he will continue the work of Mr. Kadyrov and follow the Kremlin's economic plan. He has suggested that he will lure rebels from the mountains into an amnesty program and peaceful lives. He has vowed to curb the abductions for ransom and to force law enforcement officers to work without their faces hidden behind masks, a common practice here.</p>
        <p>Early in his candidacy, he declared the war against the militants all but won, saying only 500 rebels and terrorists remain. That proved to be a gaffe. The Chechen war promptly spread, as bands of guerrillas carried out the worst attacks that modern Russia has ever seen, including the school siege last month in Beslan, which ended with the deaths of hundreds of hostages, roughly half of them children.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Alkhanov's Kremlin support is beyond question, his legitimacy is less clear. Nongovernment organizations have pointedly dismissed his election as a farce, and warned that a charade of democracy disenfranchises moderates and will not dissuade the rebels.</p>
