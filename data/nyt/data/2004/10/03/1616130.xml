        <p>RIKERS ISLAND is not one prison but a world of prisons -- scores of buildings identified by cryptic acronyms, separated by ribbon wire, linked by a fleet of rickety Department of Correction buses; between jail and jail, you see nothing, except stray cats, sea gulls and the occasional hawk.</p>
        <p>The population seems almost exclusively black, Latino and poor; and disturbingly young. Many are ''substance abusers,'' a term that can mask a host of unspoken catastrophes. One kid's fidgets may be the result of crack; another's college plans froze when he was caught with marijuana. ''I came to Rikers to meet my father,'' one young prisoner told me proudly.</p>

        <p>RIKERS ISLAND is not one prison but a world of prisons -- scores of buildings identified by cryptic acronyms, separated by ribbon wire, linked by a fleet of rickety Department of Correction buses; between jail and jail, you see nothing, except stray cats, sea gulls and the occasional hawk.</p>
        <p>The population seems almost exclusively black, Latino and poor; and disturbingly young. Many are ''substance abusers,'' a term that can mask a host of unspoken catastrophes. One kid's fidgets may be the result of crack; another's college plans froze when he was caught with marijuana. ''I came to Rikers to meet my father,'' one young prisoner told me proudly.</p>
        <p>In 1998 I was hired to lead poetry workshops at Island Academy, one of three public schools on Rikers Island. The first time I taught creative writing there, I suggested a broad theme: ''My Life.'' I watched a teenager smooth out a piece of paper and write those words at the top, then his street name, then his name. An hour later he was still writing.</p>
        <p>Here are a few poems by teenagers at Rikers, reproduced by permission of Island Academy. Because it is the policy of the city's Departments of Education and Correction to maintain the confidentiality of the students, only their first names are used.</p>
        <p>What I Don't See</p>
        <p>Cuticle in my pupil</p>
        <p>in a dispute when it's futile</p>
        <p>One finger on a trigger</p>
        <p>Stomach full of liquor</p>
        <p>Trying to run around the world</p>
        <p>like a bird when it's winter</p>
        <p>Destroying a whole tree just to make a splinter</p>
        <p>My center is being a mentor for my younger genders</p>
        <p>while the necromancy of the ghetto enhances me</p>
        <p>I write down life frantically</p>
        <p>When you're too tired</p>
        <p>put to sleep your sanity</p>
        <p>and awake your fantasy</p>
        <p>Kariem</p>
        <p>One Phone Call</p>
        <p>If I had one phone call</p>
        <p>I would call my father from the dead</p>
        <p>and pray that I don't get shot in the head</p>
        <p>and pray that I could see him sleeping in mother's bed</p>
        <p>and pray that he was never dead</p>
        <p>Andrew</p>
        <p>My Life</p>
        <p>My life is hard and I don't know why I live this way</p>
        <p>I've seen death between my eyes</p>
        <p>My moms kicked me out when I was 9 years old</p>
        <p>I was roaming the streets like a soldier at war.</p>
        <p>The streets are so dark and so lonely</p>
        <p>sometimes I tremble, sometimes I cry.</p>
        <p>I still ask myself why God wanted it to be this way.</p>
        <p>I feel God put me in this world to be a soldier,</p>
        <p>to carry my crown until the day I die.</p>
        <p>Pedro</p>
        <p>The Maze</p>
        <p>My train of thoughts moves faster than the speed of light.</p>
        <p>It moves so fast it's hard to catch, like a rat in a maze,</p>
        <p>and it drives me insane.</p>
        <p>It is the maze of my brain, it's not hard to get lost in my</p>
        <p>thoughts.</p>
        <p>And once I get lost, I don't want to be found.</p>
        <p>I just wander the rooms of my mind,</p>
        <p>always looking out the windows but never there.</p>
        <p>What's behind the next corner?</p>
        <p>Is it the tangerine trees and marmalade sky</p>
        <p>or the two sheets before I lost my mind?</p>
        <p>Whatever it is, it's no surprise because I put it there</p>
        <p>before I sealed the maze shut.</p>
        <p>Now it's just a matter of pulling and throwing things</p>
        <p>in and out the windows and understanding</p>
        <p>the train of thought in my maze.</p>
        <p>Next stop: Understanding!</p>
        <p>Omar</p>
        <p>AM</p>
        <p>At night I lie on my bed wondering</p>
        <p>if people are thinking of me</p>
        <p>or have I been forgotten?</p>
        <p>I am just a number in this hell-hole</p>
        <p>and a number I will be</p>
        <p>if I'm forgotten</p>
        <p>Just the thought of me on someone's mind</p>
        <p>gives me chills</p>
        <p>Anthony</p>
        <p>The Story</p>
        <p>What's the story?</p>
        <p>Whose story to believe?</p>
        <p>His-story, her-story</p>
        <p>or the story of the seeds,</p>
        <p>the seeds that the breeze</p>
        <p>has carried afar</p>
        <p>across land and sea</p>
        <p>or Her-story of the stars,</p>
        <p>Her-story of the land and sea</p>
        <p>the seeds breeze across,</p>
        <p>or His-story of His glory</p>
        <p>and His death upon a cross?</p>
        <p>My-story is: their story</p>
        <p>has only got me confused.</p>
        <p>There are so many stories</p>
        <p>of men and their glory.</p>
        <p>The true story</p>
        <p>is harder to choose.</p>
