        <p>Harvard continued its unbeaten season Saturday afternoon, as well as its recent dominance of Princeton.</p>
        <p>With Clifton Dawson running for three touchdowns, and Ryan Fitzpatrick leading a potent passing attack, Harvard rolled to a 39-14 victory at Princeton Stadium. It was the ninth consecutive victory for Harvard against Princeton, and the Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy League) remained tied for the league lead with Penn, which defeated Yale. The Crimson will play at Penn on Nov. 13.</p>
        <p>Dawson, a star sophomore running back from Scarborough, Ontario, ran for 201 yards on 31 carries, while setting Harvard's single-season touchdown record. With 14 touchdowns this season, Dawson broke the record of 13 by Chris Menick in 1997. Dawson's last touchdown was his most spectacular. He found a small hole, bolted through Princeton's line and scampered 80 yards untouched into the end zone.</p>
        <p>''I knew that I was close to breaking the record, either this game or the next couple of games,'' said Dawson, who transferred to Harvard from Northwestern. ''I'm honored to be in the presence of such great backs as we've had at Harvard. It's a compliment to how well our offensive line has played. Their name deserves to be up there right beside mine.''</p>
        <p>After falling behind, 14-3, Harvard scored the game's final 36 points. Harvard has scored at least 34 points in every game this season. Princeton fell to 4-2 over all and 2-1 in the Ivy League.</p>
        <p>''It just took a little bit of time for the offense to start clicking, but as soon as we did, we kind of got on a roll,'' said Fitzpatrick, who passed for 172 yards.</p>
        <p>Harvard's comeback began in the second quarter, when an 18-yard pass from Fitzpatrick to Brian Edwards set up a 2-yard scoring run by Dawson, which pulled Harvard to 14-9. Matt Schindel missed the extra point, but the momentum turned in Harvard's favor. Princeton was stopped on its next possession, and on fourth down, a bad snap by Andrew Aurich sailed over the head of punter Colin McDonough. After McDonough finally retrieved the ball near the goal line, he illegally kicked it out of bounds, giving Harvard first-and-goal at Princeton's 1-yard line. Dawson scored on the next play, giving Harvard the lead for good, 15-14, after its failed 2-point conversion attempt.</p>
        <p>On Princeton's next possession, Harvard's defense delivered a big play. Quarterback Matt Verbit threw a pass that was intercepted by Doug Hewlett, who returned the ball to Princeton's 38. Eight plays later, Fitzpatrick found Corey Mazza on a post pattern for a 10-yard touchdown pass that put Harvard ahead at halftime, 22-14.</p>
        <p>After a scoreless third quarter, Harvard extended its lead to 29-14, driving 57 yards in 13 plays, capped by Fitzpatrick's 3-yard touchdown run. Schindel added a 38-yard field goal, followed by Dawson's 80-yard run.</p>
        <p>PENN 17, YALE 7 -- Sam Mathews rushed for 169 yards on 25 carries, including two touchdowns, to lead visiting Penn.</p>
        <p>The victory extended Penn's Ivy League winning streak to 18 games, breaking its own mark set from 1992 to '95.</p>
        <p>Mathews gained 125 yards in the second half, as Penn (5-1, 3-0) ran 48 plays.</p>
        <p>Yale is 3-3 and 1-2 in the league. The score was tied at 7-7 at halftime.</p>

        <p>BROWN 21, CORNELL 17 -- Anthony Vita passed for 219 yards and 3 touchdowns as host Brown rallied to beat Cornell.</p>
        <p>Vita, a sophomore making his first start, completed 15 of 30 passes and threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter as Brown (4-2, 1-2) overcame a 17-7 deficit.</p>
        <p>Ryan Kuhn ran for two touchdowns and passed for 121 yards for Cornell (1-5, 1-2), which lost its fourth straight.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>COLUMBIA 9, DARTMOUTH 6 -- Nick Rudd's third field goal of the game broke a tie in the fourth quarter, and host Columbia snapped its six-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>It was the first victory for Columbia (1-5, 1-2) since Nov. 11, 2003, when the Lions beat Cornell, 34-21. They lost their final game against Brown before opening this season 0-5.</p>
