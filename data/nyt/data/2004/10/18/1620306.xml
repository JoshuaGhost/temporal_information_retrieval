        <p>More than six weeks after guerrillas retreated from the Imam Ali Shrine, leaving a ring of devastation after a three-week battle with American troops, little rebuilding has occurred in some of the most heavily damaged zones, and residents say they are worried and confused about the future of their restaurants, shops, hotels and homes.</p>
        <p>American officials say they can do little about the pace of reconstruction in the part of the Old City surrounding the shrine, one of the holiest places in Shiite Islam, because the Iraqi government has taken over responsibility for the job. But American and Iraqi rebuilding officials say that they have recently made progress in compensating people who were hurt in the fighting or who lost family members.</p>
        <p>Those officials also point to tens of millions of dollars in rebuilding projects elsewhere in the city in what they describe as an extensive effort to put it back on its feet.</p>
        <p>Still, during a recent visit by Western and Iraqi reporters, disputes broke out among Iraqi and American officials about the management, pace and ultimate usefulness of three of those rehabilitation projects: those at a major hospital, the main water treatment plant and a sewage treatment plant.</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, some business owners said they had been stonewalled in their efforts to collect the payments that had been promised for damage inflicted by American weapons, which turned walls into rubble and caused whole buildings to crumble.</p>
        <p>Ali Hussein Abed Zahid said that he submitted a damage claim for 150 million Iraqi dinars, or $105,559, to the hotel he owns, but that no action had been taken, and that his losses were increasing as it remained closed. Adnan Rashid Kadhim, who owned two watch shops that were destroyed, said recently that he had received ''only promises and postponement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadhim called the scene in the Old City painful, adding, ''You can see destruction everywhere.''</p>
        <p>Capt. Carrie Batson, a spokeswoman for the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, said that the pace of payments for injuries, death and damage had picked up and that more than $1 million had been given out. ''We will pay for damage, death, injury caused by us,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As American-led forces lay siege to areas around the country that had slipped from their control, it seems likely that a delicate issue the Americans thought they had left behind after the invasion last year -- rebuilding areas devastated by fighting -- will crop up again and again before the Iraqi elections that are planned for early next year.</p>
        <p>A senior American official said the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office at the United States Embassy in Baghdad was aware of the issue and would be searching for money to carry out this new task.</p>
        <p>The office ''is making an effort to focus other resources, reconstruction work, on cities that have been the location of military action, like Najaf,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Whole blocks were obliterated during the fighting between the American military and guerrillas loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, a young cleric who had taken a militant stance about the American occupation. ''Everything was done to minimize the damage,'' said Maj. David Holahan, a Marine commander who was involved in the battle, ''but there's only so much you can do.''</p>
        <p>The area within roughly 100 yards of the shrine may never be rebuilt, said Majid Jebreen, chief of the supervisory committee for reconstruction in Najaf and the local coordinator for the Project and Contracting Office, which is affiliated with the Pentagon and the United States Embassy in Baghdad and is managing $18.4 billion in rebuilding money.</p>
        <p>The reason, Mr. Jebreen said, is that the Iraqi government has decided to clear some of the warrens of serried buildings, with their narrow alleyways and innumerable passages, to give more room to the millions of Muslims who visit the shrine each year. American and Iraqi officials denied that the move was an effort to improve security around the shrine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jebreen said that ''not much rebuilding or reconstruction has been done'' in the Old City. The exception, he said, was work on utilities like electrical and water lines. Amir Muhammad Hasan, the owner of an optics shop in the Old City, said some electrical work was taking place.</p>
        <p>About 1,500 of 9,000 claims involving death or injury have been paid, said Ahmad al Fatlawi, chief of the committee handling compensation. ''The problem is that the issue of hotels and building owners has been postponed,'' Mr. Fatlawi said, while the other claims were addressed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zahid and other residents remained confused about when, or if, they would get help. Ahmed Jasem Abod, a shop owner whose business was damaged, said he filed a claim two months ago but had received no payment.</p>
        <p>Farther from the center of the city, the mood on the streets seemed lighter, and construction work on a modest scale was seen at a number of homes and businesses. American officials asserted that in the Najaf area alone, hundreds of projects totaling tens of millions of dollars were in progress or had been completed -- claims that are notoriously difficult to check in a country so treacherous for travelers.</p>
        <p>When the visitors arrived at one of the most prominent of those projects, a $4.5 million hospital renovation financed mostly by the Project and Contracting Office, disagreements broke out between Iraqi and American officials over whether the effort would ever produce a functioning medical center.</p>
        <p>An Iraqi engineer working on the project said the Americans had put most of their effort into cosmetic work like fixing the ceilings and drywall on the ground floor, where visitors could see the renovations. But he said maintenance work on seriously damaged water and sewerage systems in the building was so inadequate that the hospital could not be used soon.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure the maintenance process is useless,'' the engineer said. ''I'm sure.''</p>
        <p>He was largely backed up by Dr. Safa al-Amedy, the hospital's director, who said parts of the sewerage system remained plugged even after renovation. He also contended that the American contractor in charge of the work, Parsons Corporation, based in Pasadena, Calif., had behaved arbitrarily and did not consult Iraqis on the scheduling of the work or its priorities.</p>
        <p>Americans at the contracting office defended the work and said the hospital would be fully functioning by the time it was handed over to the Iraqis.</p>
        <p>''We will do whatever it takes to fix the sewage problem to ensure that the people of Najaf have a quality hospital,'' said Col. Jeffrey E. Phillips, an Army Reserve officer who is a spokesman for the contracting office.</p>
        <p>On the same trip, questions arose about nearly $10 million in American-paid work on Najaf's main water and sewage treatment plants. Mr. Jebreen and an American military engineer said both plants were largely nonfunctional, but the American contractor involved, the Bechtel Corporation, based in San Francisco, said the water plant was running between 65 percent and 75 percent of capacity.</p>
        <p>A Bechtel spokesman later wrote in an e-mail message that the water plant ''now has the capacity to run at 100 percent if operated and maintained properly.'' Several American officials asserted that the plant was, however, being operated inefficiently by the Iraqi ministries that are in charge, failing to staff the project sufficiently and causing it to lack money for operating costs.</p>
        <p>All sides agreed that the sewage plant was not working. A spokesman for the United States Agency for International Development, which is overseeing the work, said that violence and other problems in Iraq had delayed the project but that it would be completed by February.</p>
