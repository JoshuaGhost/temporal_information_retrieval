        <p>Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is trying to find locations for the cremated remains of 87 persons left unclaimed at a Danbury funeral home that closed two years ago.</p>
        <p>He said the remains, mostly from the 1980's and 1990's, were found at the Tomlinson-Homestead Funeral Home, which closed when the owner, David Harrison, lost his state embalming license.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said he was not investigating how or why the remains were left unclaimed.</p>
        <p>''There are no claims that criminal violations or unfair trade practices took place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said the remains were being held by a vault company, which he said did not wish to be identified. He said anyone wishing to claim them should contact his office or the State Board of Examiners, Funeral Directors and Embalmers.</p>
