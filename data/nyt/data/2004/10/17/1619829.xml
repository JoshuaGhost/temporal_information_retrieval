        <p>New Yorkers are proud to participate in American democracy at election time, and we'll do so again two weeks from Tuesday -- even though the system seems determined to discourage us. The Electoral College makes us feel irrelevant in the presidential race; gerrymandered districts produce Congressional and state legislative races in which the incumbents have virtual lifetime tenure. And this year's New York Senate contest between Senator Charles Schumer and Assemblyman Howard Mills is so lopsided that pollsters say the only suspense is whether the inexperienced, underfinanced Republican challenger will come in ahead of the third-party candidates.</p>
        <p>The good news is that Mr. Schumer has been a senator who deserves to be re-elected. He's hard working, principled and as dedicated to New York's needs as the most self-obsessed state resident could hope. (His vote last week for an obscene package of special-interest tax breaks because it contained development aid to upstate communities seemed to us to be carrying the cause a little too far.) He scored a coup early in his term when he succeeded in bringing expanded air service to upstate New York, and after Sept. 11, 2001, he was indefatigable in his efforts to get federal aid for New York City.</p>

        <p>New Yorkers are proud to participate in American democracy at election time, and we'll do so again two weeks from Tuesday -- even though the system seems determined to discourage us. The Electoral College makes us feel irrelevant in the presidential race; gerrymandered districts produce Congressional and state legislative races in which the incumbents have virtual lifetime tenure. And this year's New York Senate contest between Senator Charles Schumer and Assemblyman Howard Mills is so lopsided that pollsters say the only suspense is whether the inexperienced, underfinanced Republican challenger will come in ahead of the third-party candidates.</p>
        <p>The good news is that Mr. Schumer has been a senator who deserves to be re-elected. He's hard working, principled and as dedicated to New York's needs as the most self-obsessed state resident could hope. (His vote last week for an obscene package of special-interest tax breaks because it contained development aid to upstate communities seemed to us to be carrying the cause a little too far.) He scored a coup early in his term when he succeeded in bringing expanded air service to upstate New York, and after Sept. 11, 2001, he was indefatigable in his efforts to get federal aid for New York City.</p>
        <p>Six years ago, when Mr. Schumer first ran for the Senate, he said that he had examined both his political options and his own character and determined that he was equipped, first and foremost, to be a legislator. Since then, he has shown talent in that role and scored some impressive victories -- particularly his work on behalf of a bill that protected consumers' rights to buy cheaper generic drugs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he has become skilled in advancing legislative goals by tagging amendments to larger omnibus measures, and he has often managed to improve the bills that do come up, or at least make them less awful. We are especially proud of his untiring battle on behalf of strong gun-control legislation, even though in recent years he has been fighting against the political tide. We are grateful, too, for his help in blocking a misbegotten energy bill that would have done far more harm than good, both to the environment and to the tax structure.</p>
        <p>When President Bush nominated John Ashcroft for attorney general, Mr. Schumer was one of the first to voice opposition -- a position that has seemed wiser and wiser as time goes on. Since then, one of Mr. Schumer's most important roles has been as a protector of civil liberties and a bulwark against the administration's attempt to stuff the judiciary with extreme conservatives. It has been a thankless and difficult battle, but if Mr. Bush wins another term next month, he will undoubtedly be in a position to name new members to the Supreme Court, and it will be critical to have someone with Mr. Schumer's spine helping to lead the fight for moderate, well-qualified nominees.</p>
        <p>The biggest jibe about the senator's performance in office is that he's never met a microphone or camera he didn't want to spend more time with. If the worst quality we had to worry about in our elected officials were their availability to the media, the world would be a happier place.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old Mr. Mills, who has served three terms in the Legislature, gets credit for stepping up and agreeing to make the race. And he has campaigned hard despite a lack of financial support from state Republicans or any sign of serious backing from Washington.</p>
        <p>But there is no question that Charles Schumer deserves to be returned to Washington. We are pleased to endorse him for re-election.</p>
