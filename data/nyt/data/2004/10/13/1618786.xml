        <p>The Lower East Side Girls Club, an organization that helps girls and women ages 8 to 25, has sold gingerbread brownstones and decorated cookies at Christmas to raise money for the past few years. Now the group has a bakery, the Sweet Things Bake Shop, 136 Avenue C (Eighth Street), which sells tender butter cookies, lovely chocolate and vanilla cupcakes, scones and rich brownies. The bakers are teenage members of the club, supervised by Miladys Ramirez, below right, with Carmen Leandry, at left, and Valerie Galindo. Coffee, iced tea and granola are also sold at the shop. Orders for holiday specialties may be placed there.</p>
