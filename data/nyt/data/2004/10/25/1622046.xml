        <p>John Yost, a founder of the San Francisco agency now known as Black Rocket Euro RSCG, is leaving as his contract expires. His departure comes as the agency's future looks uncertain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yost, 55, the president of the agency, said he planned to do ''something different'' that would not involve working at ''Black Rocket 2.'' His reference was to the talks that Steve Stone, another founder and the executive creative director, is having with the agency's parent, the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, about reacquiring some Black Rocket assets that may or may not include the Black Rocket name. Mr. Stone's contract is also expiring.</p>

        <p>Mr. Yost, 55, the president of the agency, said he planned to do ''something different'' that would not involve working at ''Black Rocket 2.''

Mr. Stone's contract is also expiring.</p>
        <p>The future of the agency, which opened in 1996, has been in flux since August 2003, when it lost its largest client, Yahoo. Adweek reported that another client, See's Candies, part of Berkshire Hathaway, is leaving for Grant, Scott &amp; Hurley in San Francisco. Euro RSCG is ''in the process of finalizing the transition plans for accounts and people,'' a spokesman in New York, Owen Dougherty, said.</p>
