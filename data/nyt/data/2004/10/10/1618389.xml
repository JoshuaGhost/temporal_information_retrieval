        <p>There's no law against laughing over spilled milk, is there? I hope not. Frankly, I don't see too many other options. The United States had a chance to make something brilliant out of the post-cold-war period. And we blew it. And we're never, never -- not ever -- going to get another chance. It's done. Over. Finished. Finito.</p>
        <p>Too bad. But why brood? If the United States can't hack glory, let's try for hilarity. Let's do what we do best: sitcoms. So, crank up the laugh track. Send in the clowns. And get Carol Burnett in here to give a Tarzan yodel.</p>

        <p>Code Red! Code Red! A Severe Risk of Giggle Attack Warning has been issued for Friday, when ''Team America: World Police'' opens at theaters all across our merry land. The new movie, by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are the creators of the ''South Park'' television series, looks poised to become the ''Dr. Strangelove'' of the war on terror. Featuring an all-marionette cast of more than 200, ''Team America'' will show us all How to Stop Worrying About Weapons of Mass Destruction and Love the Axis of Evil. (Me, I'm going to stick with the Girlie-Man Team. I'm convinced that no substance on earth is tougher than a tough girlie-man. All I have and all I am I owe to girlie-man values, which include a passionate devotion to action-hero movies.)</p>
        <p>''Team America'' chronicles the thrilling adventures of a global security force on a mission of dire emergency. Its members must stop the North Korean strongman Kim Jong Il from selling nuclear devices to the wrong kind of people. But an even bigger challenge awaits them: can they resist being brainwashed into embracing Kim's taste in palace decoration?</p>
        <p>Our most exuberant maestro of theme design, David Rockwell, is responsible for the movie's maniacal sets. And Rockwell appears to be sending himself up along with the McDonald's view of the world. Here is a Paris with streets paved with croissants. If there are camels and sand, this must be Baghdad, or a facsimile that is reasonable enough for terrorist puppets to mistake for home.</p>
        <p>The good guys -- Spottswoode, Lisa, Joe and the other members of Team America -- hang out at a James Bond-ish military base halfheartedly concealed within Mount Rushmore's monumental presidential portraits. When Teddy Roosevelt opens his mouth, a missile blasts forth.</p>
        <p>Code cocktails, please. I'm getting thirsty -- and hungry. Rockwell's designs will do that to you. Whetting appetites is how he earns his living. Rockwell is to restaurants what Renzo Piano is to museums. Nobu. Town. Rosa Mexicano. Strip House. Kittichai. Caf√© Gray. That's just a sampling of Rockwell's tasty repertoire.</p>
        <p>Since the mid-90's, Rockwell has been branching out beyond the world of fine dining. Though we may have entered a new Dark Ages, Rockwell is determined to be a Renaissance man. Thus far, the fields he's invaded include architecture (children's hospitals, performing-arts centers); Broadway shows (''Hairspray,'' ''The Rocky Horror Show''); furniture design; and community service (the original viewing platform at Ground Zero).</p>
        <p>Now, with ''Team America,'' he's hitting the silver screen. A few years ago, Rockwell designed the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, the permanent home of the Academy Awards. Who knows? Next year, he may get to go onstage and accept a statuette.</p>
        <p>What I'm really waiting for, though, is a Defense Department contract. Operation Theme Warfare, complete with commercial tie-ins. A new line of camouflage cosmetics. Middle East Happy Meals. Embedded Bed, Bath and the Afterlife. Death imitates art.</p>
