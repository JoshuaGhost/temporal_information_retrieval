      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Patisserie St. Michel, a surprising oasis of Parisian tradition in Teaneck, is a well-kept secret of pastry fanatics in Bergen County. Owned by André and Anne Schneider, who are from Paris originally, this well-worn storefront bakery attracts nearly all its customers through word of mouth. They have been producing top-quality traditional pastries and fresh-baked French cakes, breads and cookies in the same location for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>It's best to get to the bakery in the morning, because most of Mr. Schneider's goods get snatched up by regulars long before noon. Of particular interest are the various tarts made of seasonal fruits, rich cream and handmade pastry, available as individual portions ($3 each) or as large rounds or long strips ($15 and up). One favorite? The plum frangipane, which offers juicy plums and almond-flavored cream nestled in crispy puff pastry -- a perfect balance of tart fruit and rich custard. The crème brûlée is freed from ramekins by being baked in a browned pastry shell (9 inches round, $24); it's available in vanilla as well as seasonal flavors like pistachio, mango and pumpkin.</p>

        <p>It's best to get to the bakery in the morning, because most of Mr. Schneider's goods get snatched up by regulars long before noon. Of particular interest are the various tarts made of seasonal fruits, rich cream and handmade pastry, available as individual portions ($3 each) or as large rounds or long strips ($15 and up).

        <p>The éclairs, filled with sinful chocolate or espresso mousseline, and whole or individual portions of decadent cakes of various flavors are also available. Of course, if you don't see what you desire, custom orders are also taken.</p>
        <p>The Schneiders also make wonderful croissants ($1.50), which will provide homesick Parisians with the corner boulangerie taste they have been yearning for. The croissants are light and airy, with countless puffy layers that have just the right amount of butter in them without being too greasy -- a problem that plagues even some of the most expensive and well-known Manhattan French bakeries. In addition to the plain, the bakery also has pain au chocolat, and cheese-and raisin-filled Danish. Fresh baguettes are also baked daily.</p>
