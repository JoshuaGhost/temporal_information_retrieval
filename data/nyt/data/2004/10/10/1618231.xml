        <p>Bill Parcells calls them football guys, coaches who talk the language of the sport, who love to study its nuances in endless game tape, who wear their passion on the sleeves of beat-up sweat shirts.</p>
        <p>They do not dream up complicated schemes or harbor illusions of their own brilliance. Often, they have up-from-the-bottom-rung backgrounds, time served in the least glamorous corners of the game.</p>
        <p>These were the guys Parcells liked having around, so he filled his staff with them when the Giants elevated him to his first N.F.L. head-coaching job in 1983. He kept Bill Belichick and Romeo Crennel from Ray Perkins's staff. He dug up more assistants, like Al Groh, Mike Pope and Tom Coughlin, from other places.</p>
        <p>''They're made out of the same mold,'' said Phil McConkey, a receiver who played four seasons under Parcells &amp; Company. ''They are the same people. They coached together, and they rubbed off even more on each other.''</p>
        <p>Now, 21 years later and coaching Dallas, his fourth team, Parcells runs into his football guys at every turn. They have grown into a coaching tree, using their years with Parcells to branch out in their own careers. There is still not a fancy scheme among them, no motivational speaking tours or fashionable clothing. Today, Parcells will look across Texas Stadium at Coughlin, who will coach the Giants against Dallas in a reunion of old-school compatriots.</p>
        <p>Parcells's staff with the Giants was a remarkable group.</p>
        <p>Belichick has won two Super Bowls with New England. Coughlin turned Jacksonville's expansion team into a perennial playoff contender in record time and is now charged with rejuvenating the Giants. Groh coached the Jets briefly before taking over at Virginia; the Cavaliers are 5-0 and ranked No. 10 in the nation. Crennel, Belichick's defensive coordinator, is on nearly everyone's list as a head-coaching candidate. Pope followed Parcells to the Patriots and is now a Giants assistant.</p>
        <p>''I was very fortunate to have a lot of the people that I had,'' Parcells said. ''But you know, it wasn't by accident. I tried to get guys that I thought were good, and it turned out that some of them really were.''</p>
        <p>Parcells lays no claim to having made these coaches who they are. What he did was find them, relying on recommendations and digging them out of colleges and obscure jobs, and immerse them in his atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Giants Stadium was a no-nonsense place in the Parcells years. Victories were not celebrated for long. Losses were mined for every lesson they could teach. No mistake was too small to stop a practice to fix.</p>
        <p>''When I was here, I learned a tremendous amount about winning,'' Coughlin said. ''I learned about organization. I learned about detail. I learned about continuity. I learned about presence, if you will, practice expectations being at the highest level and accepting nothing less.''</p>
        <p>None of Parcells's assistants became household names, even as the Giants won two Super Bowls, although Belichick became known in football circles as the architect of a tough-as-nails defense and got his shot as a head coach first, when Cleveland hired him in 1991.</p>
        <p>Publicly, Parcells was the charismatic presence, the king of his world. Inside the stadium, the coaches said, they did not compete with one another for credit or attention.</p>
        <p>They were all in it together.</p>
        <p>''Common denominators of that staff were playing team football, trying to do what your position or side of the ball needed to do for the team to win,'' Belichick said. ''Sometimes defensively, we'd go into a game and say: 'We've got to get turnovers in this game. We might give up a few extra yards by doing it that way, but we've got to try to run some plays where we can get people into the backfield and be disruptive.'''</p>
        <p>The coaches stayed together for long hours, preparing meticulously not just for the next game, but also for the next practice.</p>
        <p>Practices brought out the true diligence, the coaches' insistence on perfection, no matter how inconsequential a drill might have seemed. McConkey remembers that Parcells would stand next to him as he waited to catch punts. While the ball was in the air, Parcells would yell out every little thing he wanted McConkey to do. ''He put you under so much mental and emotional stress during the week,'' McConkey said. ''The games were easy.''</p>
        <p>But Coughlin, who joined the Giants' staff in 1988 as the wide receivers coach, took being a stickler for details to another level.</p>
        <p>He scheduled every minute. He set the ground rules. He demanded strict adherence. There was no discussion.</p>
        <p>The former Giants linebacker Harry Carson said he heard the wide receivers complain about Coughlin's rigidity.</p>
        <p>''Tom reminded me more of Ray Perkins than of Parcells,'' Carson said. ''I was one of Parcells's guys, and I could go to him if there was a problem and reason with him, and he would listen. Often we came to a compromise.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure players are able to do that with Tom.''</p>
        <p>To Parcells, it was just a matter of style. He had no complaints with Coughlin's way of doing things. He liked how demanding he was. He admired his passion for details.</p>
        <p>Through the years, Parcells and Coughlin have remained close, the kind of friends who do not have to talk often to maintain a bond.</p>
        <p>The tension that eventually arose between Parcells and Belichick -- over Belichick's decision not to follow him as the Jets' coach -- never arose in the relationship between Parcells and Coughlin.</p>
        <p>When Coughlin was fired by Jacksonville after the 2002 season, Parcells made it clear that he would offer Coughlin a job in a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>''I did tell him that if he ever wanted anything along those lines, that he would certainly be welcome to be with me,'' Parcells said. ''That would be a standing offer.''</p>
        <p>Wherever Parcells is, there is room for more football guys.</p>
