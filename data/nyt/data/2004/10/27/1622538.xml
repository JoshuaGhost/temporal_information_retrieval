        <p>October has become the month to tackle social issues in DC Comics. Two weeks ago, Mia, the Green Arrow's budding sidekick, learned that she had tested positive for H.I.V. In ''Outsiders'' No. 17, on sale today, the story revolves around child abuse. The Outsiders discover a group of sexually abused children, and the case strikes close to home for one of the superheroes. When the team runs out of leads, it gets help from John Walsh, left, the child advocate and host of ''America's Most Wanted.'' Mr. Walsh, whose 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted and murdered in 1981, is using his appearance in ''Outsiders'' to spread his message of awareness. ''It's going to try to teach kids about the people who exploit them and that anyone can be a victim,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''The second thing that it's going to stress is that people can help.'' The writer of ''Green Arrow'' and ''Outsiders'' is Judd Winick.</p>
