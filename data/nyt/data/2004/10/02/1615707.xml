        <p>NBC's decision this week to settle the future of the ''Tonight'' show years before it was necessary underscored more than the importance of late-night programming to the future of network television. It starkly demonstrated the surprising paucity of identifiable future late-night stars.</p>
        <p>For a genre that has been crucial to NBC and CBS for years and that ABC and Fox are nearly desperate to get a toehold in, late-night entertainment has become an area where talent is rarely developed and is mostly identified by hunches and shots in the dark.</p>

        <p>NBC's decision to settle the future of the "Tonight" show so far in advance demonstrates the paucity of identifiable future late-night stars.</p>

        <p>NBC's decision this week to settle the future of the ''Tonight'' show years before it was necessary underscored more than the importance of late-night programming to the future of network television. It starkly demonstrated the surprising paucity of identifiable future late-night stars.</p>
        <p>For a genre that has been crucial to NBC and CBS for years and that ABC and Fox are nearly desperate to get a toehold in, late-night entertainment has become an area where talent is rarely developed and is mostly identified by hunches and shots in the dark.</p>
        <p>Most executives now expect the next late-night star to break through after a career working the fringes of comedy or talk shows on cable channels. That is why a serious candidate for the host position that was recently vacated by Craig Kilborn on CBS's ''Late Late Show'' is Michael Ian Black, a ubiquitous and acerbic talking head on cable shows like VH1's ''Best Week Ever'' and ''I Love the 80's.''</p>
        <p>''There is no triple-A talk-show league,'' said Rob Burnett, the chief executive of World Wide Pants, David Letterman's production company, which programs ''Late Show With David Letterman'' and the ''Late Late Show.'' ''You're sort of left to scout out the country looking for a kid who can throw 96 miles an hour up and in.''</p>
        <p>The networks have only themselves to blame for this situation, some television executives said. ''Nobody does guest hosts anymore,'' said Robert Morton, for years the producer of Mr. Letterman's show. ''Why haven't they insisted on that when the stars have off weeks?''</p>
        <p>When Johnny Carson ruled late night for NBC, between 1962 and 1992, guest hosts appeared regularly. Mr. Letterman and then Jay Leno emerged as stars by substituting for Mr. Carson.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Letterman never had a substitute host during his 11 years as the star of NBC's 12:35 a.m. entry, ''Late Night,'' and he took that same philosophy with him to CBS. Guest hosts have appeared only when health reasons forced him off the air. Mr. Leno followed suit at ''Tonight'' and Mr. O'Brien at ''Late Night.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, standup comedy seems to have gone a bit stale, television executives said. ''There's a lot of mediocrity out there,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''Being able to do six minutes in a club is a lovely skill to have, but it's not necessarily what you're looking for in late night.''</p>
        <p>As they search for a replacement for Mr. Kilborn, who left the ''Late Late Show'' in August after five years, Mr. Burnett and CBS have been filling the job with guest hosts, some known (Drew Carey) and some obscure (Michael Gibbons, the head writer for the show). The network tried to bring in Stephen Colbert, a comic essayist from ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central, but he declined the invitation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black, a supporting actor on the NBC series ''Ed,'' which was canceled last spring, had a two-night tryout last week.</p>
        <p>Already Mr. Burnett has concluded that the likely way for CBS to go is what he called ''the Conan model.''</p>
        <p>When NBC last filled its 12:35 slot, back in 1993, it chose Mr. O'Brien, a comedy writer who had no experience as either a host or a comic.</p>
        <p>In one of the most remarkable show-business stories of recent vintage, Mr. O'Brien has turned that opportunity into a firm shot at arguably the biggest job in television, the host of ''Tonight.''</p>
        <p>NBC promised Mr. O'Brien that job in 2009 in large part to short-circuit what might have been a nasty fight over his future services, with both ABC and Fox expected to compete avidly for him. The decision seemed to indicate that NBC had concluded that Mr. O'Brien was a higher priority than the man who has provided the network with the late-night ratings and financial leadership, Mr. Leno.</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Brien, who is 41, had a sizable advantage. He is a next-generation late-night known commodity. He and Jon Stewart of ''The Daily Show,'' who is contractually locked up by Comedy Central for the next three years, are about the only names on that list.</p>
        <p>The networks' previous attempts to install a well-known name in a late-night show have not proved too successful; the likes of Chevy Chase, Pat Sajak and Joan Rivers all failed.</p>
        <p>A search for something different is what led CBS to Mr. Black, who is in his early 30's. He has worked the back lot of television, cable channels, skillfully taking advantage of the ample opportunity to get on television somewhere these days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black is not a standup comedian. He has worked for improv groups like the State. Among a large group of commentators -- ''fundits,'' as they have become known -- used by VH1 on its show, Mr. Black has stood out.</p>
        <p>''I think some of our people, like Michael, can speak in a nontelevision voice,'' Michael Hirschorn, the executive vice president of VH1 said, referring to the commentators on the cable network's shows. ''The language of television is very stilted. To the degree you can talk the way people speak in real life today, and talk to each other over the Internet, the way bloggers have shown people can care about things, it's an advantage because television is incapable of that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett said he was impressed with Mr. Black but cautioned that no decision would be made until the end of this month at the earliest. Still, the trend toward looking to nontraditional places for potential hosts seems established.</p>
        <p>''We're interested in breaking a fresh face,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''It feels like: why not?''</p>
