        <p>Biologists began searching for northern snakehead fish in Lake Michigan near downtown Chicago after a fisherman caught one in Burnham Harbor. It is the first northern snakehead to be found in the Chicago area, said Philip Willink, a biologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. The fish probably came from Russia, China or Korea and was released into the lake from a local resident's aquarium. Snakeheads are aggressive and have large appetites, and scientists fear they could eat native fish and harm the ecosystem. They have been dubbed ''Frankenfish'' for their ability to breathe air and crawl on land.</p>
