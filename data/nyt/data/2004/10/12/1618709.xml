        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Give Up? No Way. On a Matter of Life or Death, a Patient Is Overruled.'' (Oct. 5): According to the column, medical ethics apparently permits a team of doctors to hold down a screaming but fully rational patient, sedate him and shove a tube down his throat.</p>
        <p>The patient was no doubt aware that once that tube was in place, it would be almost impossible for his family to direct its removal.</p>
        <p>Forcible treatment in the face of energetic, rational opposition by a patient is not only unethical, it is probably illegal.</p>
