        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>* BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available. Also at Danny's: tonight at 7, Laura Pearson, singer; at 9:15, George Marcy, singer; tonight and tomorrow night from 9 to 1, Jerry Scott, singer and pianist; tomorrow night at 9:30, Barbara Brussell, singer; Sunday at 2 p.m., Philip Officer, singer; at 4 p.m., Beth Holland, singer; from 8 to midnight, Scott Ailing with Ryan Hunt. Cover: none to $25; two-drink minimum.</p>

        <p>STACEY KENT, Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. Smooth chemistry between a pop-jazz singer like Ms. Kent and her musicians is something audiences tend to take for granted until it's missing. Ms. Kent has a tart, buoyant voice that flutters and glints like a sunlit butterfly as it alights on the flowers of the great American songbook. But the addition of a drummer and the subtraction of a guitarist has unsettled the balance between the singer and her husband, the tenor saxophonist Jim Tomlinson, which at its silkiest recalls the bossa nova glory days of Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $50 dinner required at the early shows; $20 minimum at the late shows. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m., Barbara Carroll. Cover: $55 at 2 p.m., including brunch at noon; $80 at 8 p.m., with dinner served at 6:30.</p>

        <p>CAFE PIERRE, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, (212) 940-8195. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Kathleen Landis, singer, in ''Broadway to 52nd Street: A Song's Journey to Jazz.'' Sunday and Monday nights at 8:30, Nancy Winston, singer. No cover; $20 minimum.</p>
        <p>CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676. Tonight at 9, classic jazz with the Mark Rapp Quartet.

Cover: None to $40; two-drink minimum.</p>
