        <p>BOBBY FLAY, right, has changed his mind. Instead of opening a Latin-theme restaurant in the Judson Grill space at 152 West 52nd Street, he plans to put a brasserie there called BAR AMERICAIN. With DAVID ROCKWELL doing the design, Mr. Flay has started working on regional American dishes like slow-smoked pork chops with green onion grits, and cedar-roasted wild king salmon with a sauce of Oregon pinot noir. ''I decided that Latin was too limiting,'' he said. ''I've traveled all over America, and I really know the food well.''</p>
        <p>PACE, 121 Hudson Street (North Moore Street), is the latest addition to the restaurant collection of JIMMY BRADLEY and DANNY ABRAMS, the owners of Red Cat, the Harrison and Mermaid Inn. JOEY CAMPANARO, formerly at the Harrison, is cooking hearty Italian fare, served on a 40-seat terrace and in a 118-seat dining room given the patina of age by JIM WALROD. The name (pronounced PAH-chay) means peace.</p>

        <p>IL MULINO has opened an outpost at 1042 Northern Boulevard in Roslyn Estates on Long Island. Copious plates of food like those at the Greenwich Village original are on the menu.</p>
        <p>From 5 to 8 p.m., the lights dim in the bakery-cafe section of BAZZINI, a food store at 339 Greenwich Street (Jay Street), and it becomes ROSOLARE, a restaurant offering pastas, salads and such, mostly under $10. MICHAEL NOVARRO is at the stove. Wine is bring-your-own, with a $5 corkage fee.</p>
