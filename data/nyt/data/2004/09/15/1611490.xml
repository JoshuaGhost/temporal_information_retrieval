        <p>The Russian natural gas giant Gazprom said on Tuesday that it would buy one of the country's top oil companies, a move that would create a state-owned energy juggernaut.</p>
        <p>In an indication of just how closely the Kremlin is now shepherding Russia's energy riches, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that he personally backed a proposal that Gazprom, the country's No.1 gas concern, swap some of its shares for Rosneft, the country's No.5 oil company.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Putin also sought to reassure foreign investors that a two-tier system of share ownership known as a ring-fence -- which created cheaper shares for Russians and more expensive American depository receipts for foreign investors -- would be scrapped once the deal was finished.</p>
        <p>''I am convinced that the dual system of share ownership should be ended as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Putin said in remarks broadcast several times on state television. ''The sooner it is done, the better.''</p>
        <p>The creation of Gazpromneft, the name of the combined company, also sets the stage for the Kremlin to reassert itself in Russia's upstream oil business -- and possibly to pursue energy deals with foreign oil companies.</p>
        <p>Gazprom is technically a private company, but the state owns 39.3 percent and Mr. Putin last year installed the current management. Rosneft is an entirely state-owned oil company. Rosneft would now become a subsidiary of Gazprom, and in the process, the government's stake in the combined firm would become a controlling one.</p>
        <p>Gazprom is enormous. It produced 19.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2003, a fifth of the world's production, and with the addition of Rosneft, the company becomes the nation's fifth-largest oil producer. As a combined company, Gazpromneft will rival Exxon Mobil in assets and emerge as a state-aligned oil and gas behemoth similar in structure to Aramco of Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin pledged to drop the Gazprom share trading restrictions last fall, just weeks after the arrest of the founder of Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. Mr. Putin at the time invited some jittery Russian and foreign stock market investors to the Kremlin and promised the Gazprom ring-fence would disappear ''in a matter of months, not years.''</p>
        <p>But state control over Gazprom was always an absolute precondition for the ring-fence's coming down. With Tuesday's deal, that state control is in sight. Gazprom's chief executive, Aleksei B. Miller, said at a news conference that he was valuing Rosneft at 10.7 percent of Gazprom, which would push the government's stake to 50 percent, up from the government's 39.3 percent holding.</p>
        <p>He declined to set a date for the liberalization of Gazprom's shares, saying only that Gazpromneft as a company should be integrated by the end of 2004. ''We are moving towards the merger of these two markets,'' he said. ''The first step towards this is the state acquiring a controlling stake in Gazprom.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, Russia banned foreigners from buying locally traded shares in Gazprom to prevent the government from losing control of the company. Instead, foreigners were restricted to a small float of American depository receipts, which represented just 3.4 percent of Gazprom, and generally traded at a significant premium to the local shares, which represent about 32 percent of Gazprom.</p>
        <p>The Gazprom-Rosneft deal now paves the way for foreign investors, like international mutual funds, to own Gazprom. ''Gazprom will now be a bellwether stock,'' said Peter Halloran, president of Pharos, a hedge fund investing in Russian equities. ''If you were running a fund in London or New York, you couldn't buy Gazprom,'' he said. ''There was simply not enough stock around. It was one of the biggest companies in the world -- but with no shares available.''</p>
        <p>The creation of Gazpromneft sets the stage for the removal of the ring-fence and ''with stock now available this could attract money back into the Russian stock market as well,'' Mr. Halloran added.</p>
        <p>Removing the ring-fence means Gazprom's weighting will be increased in the widely watched MSCI index. That should generate additional demand for shares from index funds, which will be required to increase their holdings accordingly.</p>
        <p>Gazprom is also a government cash cow: it represents 20 percent of the federal budget's revenues, or about 7 percent of the country's entire output. With oil prices at record levels and steadily rising global demand for gas, the Kremlin is eager to reinsert itself into the business.</p>
        <p>As a state energy giant, Gazpromneft would have carte blanche to seal deals with major world oil companies, including possible joint ventures with Exxon Mobil or ChevronTexaco, which were thwarted in an attempt at a deal with Yukos.</p>
        <p>Yukos and Sibneft tried a similar deal, but the government was completely sidelined, said James Fenkner, head of research at Troika-Dialog, a brokerage firm. ''Now there could be a similar deal -- but the new partner is the Kremlin.''</p>
        <p>Russia is the only major oil-exporting country where the state does not own or control the biggest stake in upstream oil, or the wells and fields, said Christopher Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow. ''That is something that has clearly rankled'' the Kremlin, he wrote in a note to clients.</p>
        <p>After the country's controversial 1990's privatization process, Russia's top three oil companies -- Yukos, Lukoil and Sibneft -- became privately owned.</p>
        <p>Yukos is now under attack by state prosecutors, and its founder, Mr. Khodorkovsky , is in jail and being tried on criminal charges, including fraud, tax evasion and embezzlement. Yukos is also unwinding its failed merger with Sibneft, and even Mr. Khodorkovsky has said in recent weeks that he believes that he may be stripped of his Yukos assets.</p>
        <p>Lukoil is auctioning off the state's minority stake, but probably to a Kremlin-approved bidder, ConocoPhillips, which is seen as the front-runner.</p>
        <p>If it uses Gazpromneft to control more Russian oil at the source, the Kremlin could also have more bargaining power in global energy circles, analysts contend. Russia is not a member of OPEC, the cartel which sets a band for oil prices.</p>
        <p>''The Kremlin is strengthening its negotiating position,'' Mr. Fenkner said. ''Gazpromneft could also have geopolitical importance.''</p>
