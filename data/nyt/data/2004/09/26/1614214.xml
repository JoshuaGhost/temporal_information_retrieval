        <p>HOW close can one outfit get to its competition?</p>
        <p>For the Life Center of Long Island, an anti-abortion counseling group for pregnant women, the answer is directly across the street. Last Sunday, the Life Center formally opened a clinic on the northeast corner of Carmans Road and East Willow Street in Massapequa.

        <p>HOW close can one outfit get to its competition?</p>
        <p>For the Life Center of Long Island, an anti-abortion counseling group for pregnant women, the answer is directly across the street. Last Sunday, the Life Center formally opened a clinic on the northeast corner of Carmans Road and East Willow Street in Massapequa. On the southeast corner is a clinic operated by Planned Parenthood of Nassau County, which also provides counseling but also two services the Life Center emphatically opposes: abortions and birth control products.</p>
        <p>There were no fireworks last Sunday when the Life Center held its ribbon-cutting ceremony. Under sunny, blue skies, supporters ate a catered buffet lunch, toured the two-story center and listened to brief speeches. The center's executive director, Lorraine Gariboldi, called the opening a ''testimony to the pro-lifers on Long Island and to the unborn.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, she said the Life Center was premised on three ideas: ''We believe in the humanity of the unborn. We want to empower women to make healthy choices about their pregnancies. We do all things in love.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gariboldi said the nine-member board chose the location for ''obvious reasons.'' ''We want to attract abortion-bound women,'' she said. ''We're the competition. I make no apology for that.'' She said that with more than $500,000 worth of donations to pay for the project, the board considered locations near ''every abortion site in Nassau County.'' The Massapequa location won out because of the neighborhood's general appeal, she said, adding that the board planned to expand with additional centers in Hempstead and Riverhead.</p>
        <p>The Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, also spoke at the ribbon-cutting. ''I think it's very fortunate we're located exactly where we are,'' said Mr. Dillon, a well-known anti-abortion activist. ''The killing fields are located right across the street.''</p>
        <p>In the past, peaceful protesters have gathered outside the Massapequa Planned Parenthood clinic on the weekends, said Joann Smith, Planned Parenthood's vice president for community affairs. Although Ms. Smith characterized the new Life Center as an attempt to be ''provocative,'' she said Planned Parenthood's patients were unfazed.</p>
        <p>''Our patients are very comfortable coming to Planned Parenthood,'' Ms. Smith said. ''We don't have to make our patients feel more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gariboldi said that although the protesters were probably on the long list of individual contributors to the Life Center, they are not directly involved in its operations.</p>
        <p>She said about 60 Catholic and Protestant churches were on the donor list. St. Rose of Lima, a Roman Catholic church in Massapequa, raised $12,000 for the Life Center.</p>
        <p>In any event, she said, workers and clients of the Planned Parenthood clinic and the Life Center have gone about their business undisturbed for the last month, since the center actually started operating.</p>
        <p>The two groups have even exchanged some pleasantries, Mrs. Gariboldi said. She said that Karen Pearl, president of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County, cordially welcomed her to the neighborhood, and that Ms. Pearl said she would honor a request to refer pregnant patients who wanted to give birth to the Life Center.</p>
        <p>''We've gotten referrals from Planned Parenthood in the past, especially for baby needs,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pearl said she would refer patients ''if it's appropriate,'' but not as long as the Life Center continued to dispense what she described as inaccurate information about the level of development of a fetus at various stages. ''That's just not acceptable because that's just meant to intimidate women and make their decisions more difficult,'' Ms. Pearl said. ''To expect us to be happy partners with them I don't believe is a reasonable expectation.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gariboldi said the Life Center has 35 patients, all of whom originally came in for pregnancy tests. In their intake interviews, the women said they were contemplating having an abortion if the results were positive, Mrs. Gariboldi said. At that point, the counselors worked to learn more about the women's reasoning and try to change their minds, she said. Sometimes, she said, the women are concerned about their lack of medical insurance, which the center can help arrange through Medicaid; sometimes, it is more complicated and personal, such as an unsupportive spouse.</p>
        <p>The consultations include information about the physical and emotional risks of abortion. Also, a prospective patient will be shown a video about prenatal development and what a 6-week-old fetus looks like. That video shows the fetus with developed fingers and toes and a beating heart. ''Women when they see that they change their minds'' about getting an abortion, Mrs. Gariboldi said.</p>
        <p>There are 9 staff employees at the Life Center and more than 80 volunteers, she said. Among them are licensed therapists who have master's of social work and psychology degrees and are available to counsel women who experience post-abortion distress and depression, she said.</p>
        <p>Patients are not counseled on religion unless they request it and God is not mentioned, Mrs. Gariboldi said.</p>
        <p>One volunteer, who asked not to be identified, said she got involved with the Life Center to help women through the situation she herself once lived through. Thirty-four years ago, she said, she had an abortion, when she was 23 and her husband was 26. She said they were under a great deal of stress with a new house, twin 3-year-old boys and dreams of better careers. She said she made her decision based on what limited information was available at the time and now regrets it. ''I fully understand what it is to suffer post-abortion stress,'' she said. ''If I can help one person, then I have accomplished something.''</p>
