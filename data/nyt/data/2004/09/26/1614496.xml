        <p>Responding to a nostalgic urge to revisit Cole Pond this month, I was chagrined to discover that the steep, rocky, winding trail to it, which is less than a mile long, was much more challenging than I had remembered.</p>
        <p>Listening to my octogenarian huffing and puffing, my companion, Ruth Kirchmeier, was alert in spotting suitably shaped boulders on which I could rest and take some of my pack's weight -- it held fishing gear, a rain jacket and waders -- off my back. It was during one of those pauses that two men, both a decade or so younger than I, came up behind us. This startled me. It was the first time I had ever been overtaken by anyone on my way up.</p>

        <p>Responding to a nostalgic urge to revisit Cole Pond this month, I was chagrined to discover that the steep, rocky, winding trail to it, which is less than a mile long, was much more challenging than I had remembered.</p>
        <p>Listening to my octogenarian huffing and puffing, my companion, Ruth Kirchmeier, was alert in spotting suitably shaped boulders on which I could rest and take some of my pack's weight -- it held fishing gear, a rain jacket and waders -- off my back. It was during one of those pauses that two men, both a decade or so younger than I, came up behind us. This startled me. It was the first time I had ever been overtaken by anyone on my way up.</p>
        <p>''Youth before age,'' I said, waving them past, but the men -- Clayton Nowell of Wilmot, N.H., and Don Hinman of Danbury, N.H. -- stopped to chat. Kirchmeier and I learned that they were frequent visitors to Cole, one of the best of New Hampshire's so-called remote trout ponds.</p>
        <p>At an elevation of 1,376 feet, the 17-acre Cole Pond is more than 50 feet deep in one spot and is surrounded by mixed conifers and hardwoods.</p>
        <p>Cole has long been stocked with brook trout by the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. No significant streams enter or leave it, so there is little or no natural reproduction of trout. Only fly-fishing is permitted there. Trout from 12 to 16 inches must be released. The daily limit is two fish, only one of which can be more than 16 inches.</p>
        <p>I began fishing Cole Pond in the 1950's while living in New Hampshire. I have visited it dozens of times since, particularly in October when the forest is aflame with the red and gold of maples, beeches and birches, and the trout are moving about and feeding voraciously during the day.</p>
        <p>This day was overcast, and the temperature was in the mid-70's. There were only intimations of autumn. I was rushing the fall season, but I had other things planned for early October, and the fishing season for ponds like Cole closes Oct. 15. More than nostalgia had ignited my impulse to revisit Cole Pond. I had learned that a few years ago the state began stocking it with Kennebago brook trout, a strain that lives longer and grows larger than the usual stocked brook trout. Kennebagos in excess of three pounds have been taken from Cole.</p>
        <p>When we reached the pond about 10:30, the two anglers who had passed us were casting and wading along the shore. A third fisherman was far out on the pond in an inflatable pontoon boat. As with most of the state's remote trout waters, the forest grows to the water's edge at Cole Pond, and in most places the edges are either too muddy or too deep for wading.</p>
        <p>There is one spot at Cole's east end where a wader has room for a decent backcast: a shallow, sandy cove a few yards north of the trail's terminus. I started by wading and casting with a sinking line from there.</p>
        <p>I hooked and released a trout about six inches long on my third cast with a Muddler Minnow and in the next 10 minutes did the same with three or four more trout of similar size. Clearly, the pond's big fish weren't in that area. The surface water temperature was 69, much too warm for trout, and I was surprised that the small trout were feeding.</p>
        <p>The man in the pontoon boat, Ron LaCroix of Bow, N.H., came ashore, and I learned that for an hour or so after he had gotten to the pond that morning at 8, he had had excellent fishing, catching and releasing two trout of 15 and 17 inches and several more that were somewhat smaller. After that, he said, the action had died. He had, he said, been fishing Cole Pond for three decades.</p>
        <p>I borrowed the skiff that had been left at Cole for use by anyone and fished my favorite spots for nearly two hours, sometimes letting my fly sink more than 20 feet below the surface, but I could not get a hit.</p>
        <p>The skies darkened, light rain began to fall and in midafternoon the others departed.</p>
        <p>Kirchmeier and I dallied on the water for another hour or so in the rain, caught nothing, and lurched back down the trail in the gathering dusk.</p>
        <p>The next morning was heavily overcast and a half gale was blowing, but we drove to Long Pond in Croydon, N.H., a deep, clear 130-acre trout lake.</p>
        <p>Paddling toward the lee of the northwest shore at Long Pond, we were hurled 5 or 10 feet sideways by three sharp gusts and encountered two loons fishing over a shallow reef.</p>
        <p>The wind made paddling and fly-casting difficult, but I managed to get to most of my favorite locations on the lake. After four hours of probing the lake with a sinking line and a variety of wet flies, streamers and nymphs, I called it quits.</p>
        <p>Henceforth, when fly-fishing New Hampshire's trout lakes or remote ponds, I shall avoid summer's sultry end and choose June or early October.</p>
