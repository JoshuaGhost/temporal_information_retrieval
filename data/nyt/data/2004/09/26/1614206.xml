        <p>Jeanne A Greco letter takes issue with September 19 article about Touro Law School and its new dean, Lawrence Raful</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Wait Continues at Touro Law School'' (Long Island Journal, Sept. 19), the school's new dean, Lawrence Raful, is quoted as stating, ''We will be the only law school in the country that will be located right next door to federal and state courthouses.''</p>
        <p>As a graduate of Brooklyn Law School, I would like to make note of the proximity of that institution to the federal and state courthouses as well as to the thriving legal community in downtown Brooklyn, where the school has been located for decades.</p>

        <p>It is across the street from the state courthouse and a short walk from the federal courthouse.</p>
        <p>While I applaud Touro's efforts to relocate to Central Islip, it is not the first or only law school to have such a distinguished location.</p>
