        <p>''A huge part of our relationship is projects,'' said Jennifer Subrin, who started a business with her husband, Dennis Witnauer, making couch pillows, duvet covers and pillowcases using vintage fabrics. ''I'm an actress, and Dennis is a painter,'' she added. ''I go on the fly, and he has pretty specific ideas of how things fit together.''</p>
        <p>Their line of bright floral pillows, above, is called MeMe, after Ms. Subrin's grandmother, who retired in Florida. ''The designs are on fabrics that remind me of her, her housecoats, her upholstery, the sunroom,'' Ms. Subrin said.</p>
