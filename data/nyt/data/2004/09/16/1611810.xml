        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''At Your Service (Or Wit's End)'' (Sept. 9) : While there may be a substantial cost saving for the corporation by not having a live person answer the phone, using instead recognition by computer driven technology, the downside for the consumer and ultimately for the company may overwhelm the advantages.</p>
        <p>There are at least three classes of customers who may be put off by the technology.</p>
        <p>First, for those with English as a second language, the intonations may not be addressed properly.</p>
        <p>Second, for the elderly used to talking to an individual, the lack of human communication may be a turnoff.</p>
        <p>Finally, for soft-spoken individuals, I have found that both verbal and numerical responses many times are misinterpreted and noted incorrectly by the equipment.</p>
        <p>When a customer or a potential customer becomes frustrated, the automatic reaction is to never deal with that company again.</p>
