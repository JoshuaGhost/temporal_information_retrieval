        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I empathize with the discomfort of the Times reporters who duplicated the 1972 experiment in which subway riders were asked to give up their seats (news article, Sept. 14).</p>
        <p>I've always found it hard to ask to sit down, even during my two pregnancies. So in the last trimester of my first pregnancy, I came up with a technique that required no requests on my part: I would hang on to the bar above, standing right in front of someone, my very large belly a mere 12 inches or so from his or her face. It almost always worked.</p>
        <p>But I remember one friendly-looking man who seemed immune. He smiled up at me but stayed seated. Then he said: ''Wow! I saw the baby kick!'' And still he didn't budge. Tenacious! It still makes me laugh.</p>
