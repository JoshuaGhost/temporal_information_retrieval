        <p>Op-Ed by John Andrews, speechwriter to Pres Richard M Nixon, proposes conclusion to Pres Bush's acceptance speech that would sum up what he thinks are winning Republican campaign themes for 2004; says he should claim that it is Republican Party that is especially protective of America, confident in America, and proud of America (M)</p>

        <p>Tonight, at the Republican National Convention in New York, George W. Bush will step onto the podium and accept his party's nomination for president. Though conventions themselves have receded in importance, the acceptance speech has remained potent, offering the candidate -- even one who has been in the public eye for four years -- the chance to define himself. So what should the president say? The Op-Ed page asked speechwriters from six Republican administrations, including the current one, to propose a conclusion to President Bush's address -- one that sums up what they think the winning Republican campaign themes for 2004 should be.</p>
        <p>The choice for voters in this election comes down to how you feel about America. Americans of all political persuasions undoubtedly love this country of ours. We who are running as Republicans for the White House and the Congress claim no greater patriotism than our friends on the Democratic side. Yet there is still a very clear choice.</p>

        <p>Tonight, at the Republican National Convention in New York, George W. Bush will step onto the podium and accept his party's nomination for president. Though conventions themselves have receded in importance, the acceptance speech has remained potent, offering the candidate -- even one who has been in the public eye for four years -- the chance to define himself. So what should the president say? The Op-Ed page asked speechwriters from six Republican administrations, including the current one, to propose a conclusion to President Bush's address -- one that sums up what they think the winning Republican campaign themes for 2004 should be.</p>
        <p>The choice for voters in this election comes down to how you feel about America. Americans of all political persuasions undoubtedly love this country of ours. We who are running as Republicans for the White House and the Congress claim no greater patriotism than our friends on the Democratic side. Yet there is still a very clear choice.</p>
        <p>One party is especially protective of America -- guarding us against all enemies, vigilant in defending us militarily. That's the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>One party is especially confident in America -- trusting the ability and common sense of free individuals and local communities to make their own decisions in a climate of lower taxes and limited government. That's the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>One party is especially proud of America -- unapologetic about our history, our values, our faith, our flag; mindful of our mission as ''the last, best hope of earth.'' That again is the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Those who think our country needs to apologize, that it needs higher taxes or less defense, will not approve the leadership this administration has offered for the past four years and will not support us in this election. But we ask for the support of every American, regardless of party, who wants leadership that is protective of America and confident in America and proud of America.</p>
        <p>It's not a matter of left or right. In the words of a great president, Ronald Reagan: ''There is no such thing as a right or a left. There is only an up or down -- up to man's age-old dream, the ultimate in human freedom consistent with law and order -- or down to the ant heap totalitarianism.'' America's path still leads upward. It always has. Let us walk that path together.</p>
