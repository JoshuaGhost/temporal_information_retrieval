        <p>That rumbling emanating from Giants Stadium before noon this week was the ground shaking as 300-pound defensive linemen threw themselves on a football. They have been practicing something that became a lost art for the Giants while they went 4-12 last season: taking away the ball.</p>
        <p>On offense, there has been a renewed emphasis on a related goal: holding on to the ball.</p>
        <p>Last season, the offense yielded 20 interceptions and lost 18 fumbles, or 2.4 turnovers per game.</p>
        <p>Enter the new coach, Tom Coughlin, whose Jacksonville teams allowed 1.46 turnovers a game, the fewest under any National Football League coach who began his career after 1970.</p>
        <p>It has been a tenet of coaching that bad teams can improve most quickly in two areas -- special teams and winning the battle of the turnovers.</p>
        <p>The Giants get their final preseason chance to practice what Coughlin has preached when they play the Baltimore Ravens tonight at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Coughlin is trying to improve the kicking game by selecting Todd France, a virtually untested performer, to be the new place-kicker. And Coughlin has spent the summer by opening every practice with a 10-minute drill by the defense, rediscovering the knack of taking the ball away. Actually, the team started doing the drill in minicamp. It has become a way of life.</p>
        <p>The offense works to protect the ball, and the defense tries to strip or intercept it.</p>
        <p>Punter Jeff Feagles said the drill ''makes it difficult for running backs.''</p>
        <p>''You can see them get slapped and pounded every time they carry the ball,'' Feagles said.</p>
        <p>Middle linebacker Kevin Lewis said the priorities had been emphasized repeatedly. ''You might hear it 50 times a day, either from Coach Coughlin or Tim Lewis, our defensive coordinator,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It has worked so far. The Giants have caused six fumbles, recovering four and losing two. The drills have several aspects, going beyond merely pouncing on the ball.</p>
        <p>''If you're a big guy,'' Lance Legree, a 300-pound defensive tackle, said, ''then you're better off just falling on it, because we don't have much practice running with the ball. In the open field, you might have a tendency to want to pick it up.''</p>
        <p>The linemen are taught not only the art of picking up a ball when it is safe, but also how to run behind blockers. Of course, there is the repetition of swatting at a ball held by a running back or receiver. Hence, those bruised arms of the Giants' runners this summer.</p>
        <p>''Every defensive lineman's dream,'' Legree said, ''is to make a play with the ball.''</p>
        <p>But for the Giants, there is also the bigger picture: planning for the regular season.</p>
        <p>So Coach Coughlin, even though you have a final preseason game tonight, has your staff already started planning for the season opener against the Eagles at Philadelphia on Sept. 12?</p>
        <p>''February, maybe?'' Coughlin said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Kevin Lewis will start against the Ravens at middle linebacker, but Coach Tom Coughlin said the position was still up for grabs. Nick Greisen is competing with Lewis. ''There are five or six serious openings on the team,'' Coughlin said. ... The newest Raven, defensive back Deion Sanders, will not play, but he said he planned to suit up on opening day. ... This will be the ninth straight year that the Giants and the Ravens have played each other in the preseason.</p>
