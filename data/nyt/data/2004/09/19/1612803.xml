        <p>Jerry Peek letter on Susan Stellin's August 29 travel article on cheap air fares describes advantage of using Travelocity Web site</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Ms. Stellin cited Orbitz and Expedia as especially good places to find low fares because they let you search one day earlier or later than the day you want to travel. She didn't mention that Travelocity has a ''flexible dates'' feature, which I think is even better.</p>
        <p>If you give Travelocity a range of one or more months that you can travel, it will first show you the lowest fares available during that period, the airline offering each fare, and a summary of the particular fare's restrictions (must return within 30 days). Once you choose a fare, you'll see which days that fare is available.</p>

        <p>After choosing an outbound flight, you get the same choices for the return -- and, if none of the return dates are acceptable, a few clicks of the ''back'' button lets you choose a different outbound flight, or different fare, or even a different airline.</p>
        <p>For someone like me who has flexiblity in scheduling, Travelocity's system is much better than picking a date and an airport at random.</p>
