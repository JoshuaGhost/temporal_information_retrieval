        <p>Madden NFL 2005  The middle of August was a momentous time for sports fans. Sure, there was the start of the Olympics. But for many people the more important event was the release of the latest installment in the Madden NFL Football video-game series. According to its publisher, Electronic Arts, Madden NFL 2005 sold 1.3 million copies in the first week of its release. At $46 a pop, that's a Hollywood-movie-level opening.</p>
        <p>By now anyone who has been paying attention knows that the video-game business is huge. Despite this, individual games still tend to be seen as mindless time-wasting exercises in thumb-eye coordination. If a film is something to be dissected as an expression of culture on the arts page, most games are assessed like any other piece of software in the technology section. Sports games, in particular, don't even get the grudging respect shown to more explicitly strategy-oriented offerings like the Sims. Yet the earlier versions of Madden have sold more than 37 million copies since the game was introduced 15 years ago. If that doesn't qualify for Part of Our Culture status, what does?</p>

        <p>Madden NFL 2005  The middle of August was a momentous time for sports fans. Sure, there was the start of the Olympics. But for many people the more important event was the release of the latest installment in the Madden NFL Football video-game series. According to its publisher, Electronic Arts, Madden NFL 2005 sold 1.3 million copies in the first week of its release. At $46 a pop, that's a Hollywood-movie-level opening.</p>
        <p>By now anyone who has been paying attention knows that the video-game business is huge. Despite this, individual games still tend to be seen as mindless time-wasting exercises in thumb-eye coordination. If a film is something to be dissected as an expression of culture on the arts page, most games are assessed like any other piece of software in the technology section. Sports games, in particular, don't even get the grudging respect shown to more explicitly strategy-oriented offerings like the Sims. Yet the earlier versions of Madden have sold more than 37 million copies since the game was introduced 15 years ago. If that doesn't qualify for Part of Our Culture status, what does?</p>
        <p>One way for a nongamer to get a glimpse of Madden's appeal to its devotees is to spend an hour with an expert named Young Gunz. (Actually his name is Nathan Stanton, but among friends and serious Madden competitors, he's known as Young Gunz, and that just sounds cooler, so we'll go with it.) I met him not long ago in his Harlem apartment, in a small room dominated by a big cabinet-style TV set and a bunch of trophies from Madden video-game tournaments he has won. He is soft-spoken and only 20 years old, but he has a thorough knowledge of Madden through the ages, because he has been playing since he was 7.</p>
        <p>Young Gunz was in the middle of a game. The old TV set was hooked up to a Sony Playstation as well as to a cable modem that tapped him into a network of 300,000 potential Madden-head competitors. The first impression was exactly the techno-dazzlement you'd expect -- lifelike players, surprisingly smooth canned play-by-play from the announcers Al Michaels and John Madden and the manual dexterity of Young Gunz as he toggled from linebacker to cornerback and intercepted a pass.</p>
        <p>Soon his opponent quit, giving my host his 63rd victory of the 84 contests he had played to completion in the two weeks he owned the game. (He said the losses were caused by unfamiliarity with new features that he has since mastered.) Young Gunz made the case that while yes, fast hands are important to his victories, the Madden experience is deeper than that. You have to know the playbook. You have to be on top of real-world football players' stats, because they affect the performance of the players' Madden-world counterparts. And you have to be on top of imaginary news: the game peppers you with newspaper-style summations of the latest developments on your virtual team. For example, if your version of the Eagles aren't passing the ball to the new receiver, Terrell Owens, often enough, he might get upset and play poorly.</p>
        <p>Flipping to the game's Franchise Mode, Young Gunz broke down his team's $98 million budget. ''I got to take care of my fans,'' he observed. Indeed the game has you set the prices of tickets, parking, even concessions. Young Gunz charges low prices for food ($3 cheesesteaks), but $8 for beer. Bobblehead dolls? Twenty-two bucks. (''You know you gotta charge more for bobbleheads.'') He shared his marketing strategy: $180,000 on TV ads, $200 million on print media, etc. Strong attendance, he explained, means he'll have more money to make trades later in the season. Finally, he let me make a customized spectator, whom I gave a blond Afro, chinos and a foam No. 1 hand. ''It's like two games in one,'' he concluded.</p>
        <p>Simon Williams, the president of a marketing firm called Sterling Group, has lately been studying video-game culture. To him the key to the success of a game like Madden is the immersion experience that it offers. ''The more lifelike it becomes, the more it transports you,'' he says. ''It's like reading a book and watching a movie.'' In other words, there's something more going on here than passive, mindless escapism: it's active, complex, multilayered escapism. Which is no doubt what keeps Young Gunz coming back for more, year after year.</p>
