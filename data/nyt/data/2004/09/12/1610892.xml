        <p>A GOVERNMENT report on Tuesday about the current account deficit for the second quarter is likely to prompt new concerns about the value of the dollar.</p>

        <p>A GOVERNMENT report on Tuesday about the current account deficit for the second quarter is likely to prompt new concerns about the value of the dollar.</p>
        <p>The current account measures the country's balance of trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. It is expected to be a deficit of $158 billion for the second quarter, raising the total for the first six months of the year to about $303 billion, more than 11 percent higher than the deficit for the first six months of 2003.</p>
        <p>At that rate, the deficit could top $600 billion for the year, swamping the record of $531 billion set last year.</p>
        <p>Currency strategists worry that the deficit must be covered by money from abroad, and that if this flow slows down, interest rates may go higher and the dollar lower.</p>
        <p>Despite the growth in the deficit, the dollar has been relatively stable for the last several months; it is actually up for the year against both the euro and the Japanese yen -- maybe because the foreign funds flow into the United States has been speeding up, not slowing down.</p>
        <p>In the first six months of the year, foreigners bought a net $440.5 billion of American stocks and bonds, up from $326.3 billion in the first six months of 2003, according to Treasury Department figures adjusted to fully reflect the net inflow of foreign money.</p>
        <p>That flow is well ahead of the size of the current account deficit. But one major concern is that a large part of this money is coming from foreign central banks, especially those in China and Japan.</p>
        <p>So far this year, official foreign institutions, which include central banks, have bought 30 percent, or $150.6 billion, of the $504.3 billion that foreigners spent on United States Treasury, agency and corporate bonds, before special adjustments. That is up from $56.1 billion, or 15.6 percent, in the first six months of 2003.</p>
        <p>Just going back to the 2003 pace would lower the adjusted inflow to about $370 billion, so a change in the appetite of other foreign investors could quickly make the current account deficit very troubling.</p>
        <p>DATA RUSH -- This week's data will provide a broad measure of the economy's well-being. A report on Tuesday on August retail sales is expected to show a decline of 0.1 percent, according to Bloomberg News, but that is mostly because of a slowdown in auto sales. Retail sales, excluding autos, are expected to rise 0.2 percent, matching the July gain.</p>
        <p>Industrial production for August, to be reported Wednesday, is expected to show a jump of 0.5 percent, after a 0.4 percent climb in July. The Consumer Price Index for August, due on Thursday, is predicted to rise 0.2 percent, after a 0.1 percent decline in July.</p>
