        <p>Gregory Ratoff's 1939 film ''Intermezzo'' and Richard Boleslawski's 1936 film ''The Garden of Allah'' are both included in MGM's release of selected weepies produced by David O. Selznick in the 30's and 40's. But the similarities end there -- one is juicy, the other merely wet. In ''Intermezzo,'' Leslie Howard and, in her first English-language role, Ingrid Bergman play a violinist and a pianist whose passion for music draws them together and causes untold pain for his wife and family. The problem is, Howard's violinist is too much of a puppet to inspire much of anything except snoozing -- both Bergman's dewily desirable pianist and Edna Best's dull but long-suffering wife are far too good for him.</p>

        <p>In ''The Garden of Allah,'' duty again wins out over passion, as it must, but not at the expense of heady eroticism. Marlene Dietrich is a devout Christian seeking peace in the Sahara after the death of her father; Charles Boyer is a troubled man of the cloth whose curiosity about this thing called love has bedeviled him into fleeing the monastery. Together they see God, and He ain't no mirage. Dietrich reinvents the religious pilgrim as a serene siren: beneath the visible coolness of her skin, you know she's sizzling. In her lam√© gowns and fluid jersey cloaks (her only protection from the swirling desert winds), she's the patron saint of old-Hollywood glamour and mystery, the embodiment of every graven image we ever wanted to believe in. What monk could resist her?</p>
