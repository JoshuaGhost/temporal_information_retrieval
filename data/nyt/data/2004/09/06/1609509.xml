        <p>Editors' Note: Aug 27 article should have said probe of policies for interrogating prisoners in Iraq found Maj Gen Geoffrey Miller 'presented' to Lt Gen Ricardo S Sanchez and his staff, not 'recommended,' practices used at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; should have also mentioned probe report 'observation' that Miller's visit to Iraq did not introduce 'harsh techniques' into Abu Ghraib</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Aug. 27 reported that policies for interrogating prisoners in Iraq, approved in late 2003 by Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, then the top commander there, drew on interrogation practices previously approved for captives in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The article included findings from an investigation by three Army generals into the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison. They said General Sanchez and his staff, in developing rules for Iraq, had relied on information about interrogation practices at Guantánamo provided during a visit to Iraq by Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, a commander at Guantánamo.</p>
        <p>While the article said some of the practices approved by General Sanchez had been ''recommended'' by General Miller and his team, the report said only that these methods had been ''presented'' to commanders in Iraq by General Miller. The article should also have mentioned an ''observation'' included in the report, written by Maj. Gen. George Fay: ''Major General Miller's visit did not introduce 'harsh techniques' into the Abu Ghraib interrogation operation.''</p>
