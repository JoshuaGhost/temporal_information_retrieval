        <p>The players of Scandinavia have long been at the top of the international ladder and collect medals regularly in European and world championships. Even tiny Iceland has won the Bermuda Bowl, the oldest world trophy. The women of Denmark have been outstandingly successful.</p>
        <p>Geir Helgemo and Tor Helness, two Norwegian stars who are frequently in contention on both sides of the Atlantic, took part in the Spingold Teams in New York in July. They sat North and South on the diagramed deal, which was challenging for both sides. An efficient sequence led to four hearts, with a fourth-suit bid of three diamonds helping to locate the 5-3 fit.</p>
        <p>West led the trump deuce, and dummy's eight won the trick. The declarer called for the club queen and ruffed when East covered with the ace. The best play at this point would have been a spade to the ace, but South crossed to the heart queen. He then led the club jack and discarded a diamond. West took his king and led a heart to dummy's king.</p>
        <p>The declarer discarded a diamond on the club ten. He then cashed the spade ace, and when the queen appeared from West he correctly concluded that West had no more. This was an example of the principle of restricted choice: when an honor falls, it is likely to be because the defender has no choice in the matter. South therefore finessed the spade eight successfully and led the diamond king.</p>
        <p>West won with the ace, leaving this tricky position:</p>
        <p>West routinely returned the diamond queen, thinking it could do no harm. But it did. Helness ruffed, led the spade five and endplayed East to score the last two tricks and his contract.</p>
        <p>West had fatally removed his partner's exit card. If he had led the club nine, establishing two inaccessible winners for the declarer in his dummy, the contract would have been defeated. The Helness team gained 12 imps when the same contract failed in the replay.</p>
