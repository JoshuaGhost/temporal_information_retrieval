        <p>As expected, Lebanon's Parliament on Friday rubber-stamped Syria's order to keep its handpicked president in office, voting in an extraordinary session to amend the Constitution to give him three more years.</p>
        <p>Moments after the 96-to-29 vote, preset fireworks exploded in the darkness around the Parliament headquarters in downtown Beirut, which was already plastered with freshly printed posters of President Émile Lahoud.</p>
        <p>Syria has long called the political shots in Lebanon since a 15-year civil war ended in 1990. About 20,000 Syrian troops are still stationed here.</p>
        <p>But what was widely regarded as a heavy-handed effort by Damascus to push the amendment through this week has generated widespread Lebanese resentment. And it has raised questions among political commentators over what they regarded as clumsy miscalculations by Syria's young ruler, Bashar al-Assad, the son of the country's longtime dictator, Hafez al-Assad.</p>
        <p>After weeks of hand-wringing articles in the local news media over the possibility that Mr. Lahoud's time in office would be extended past its constitutionally mandated single six-year term, which is to end in November, the Syrians suddenly clamped down. A cabinet meeting was unexpectedly convened last week, and the constitutional amendment was authorized. The speaker of Parliament, Nabih Berri, head of the Shiite Muslim movement Amal and a close ally of Syria, rushed through procedures to summon Friday night's parliamentary session.</p>
        <p>The rush appeared to be, at least in part, an effort to beat a joint American-French resolution in the United Nations that was approved late Thursday. The measure, passed by a vote of 9 to 0 with six abstentions, warned against outside interference in the Lebanese elections and called for the removal of all foreign troops. Syria was not specifically named in the resolution, but it was clearly aimed at Damascus.</p>
        <p>In the always complex politics of the Middle East, the American position has created problems for Syria's critics. In the current climate in the Arab world, where America is not only viewed as the unquestioning champion of Israel but also as having caused a mess in Iraq, few want to be associated with the United States. Further, there is a perception that the same administration hawks who pushed the war against Iraq would like to turn their sights on Syria.</p>
        <p>In Beirut's influential daily An Nahar, which has waged a campaign against extending Mr. Lahoud's mandate, Sahar Baasiri, a senior columnist, wrote that one of Syria's main mistakes in the affair was in laying itself open to the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>''Damascus appeared to be giving Washington a gift,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>In the international Arabic daily Al Hayat, Walid Shucair wrote that the Syrians had miscalculated the reaction to their pressure, both from the Americans and French, and from within. The move has brought intransigent resistance from figures including Patriarch Nasrullah Sfeir of the Maronite Christians, of which Mr. Lahoud is a member; and from the Druse chieftain, Walid Jumblatt.</p>
        <p>''Don't these three miscalculations show how high the price is for extending Lahoud's mandate compared with the election of a new president?'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Even as the vote was scheduled, a poll published Friday in the Lebanese weekly magazine Ash Shiraa, showed an overwhelming majority opposed to the extension of Mr. Lahoud's term.</p>
        <p>The sampling of 1,000 people of all Lebanese political, religious, social, factional and economic brackets, the magazine said, showed that 65 percent opposed amending the Constitution and that 74 percent wanted a new president. The poll also showed that 84 percent of the Lebanese believed that foreign and outside parties dictated the results of presidential elections.</p>
        <p>The results were widely regarded as preordained when the parliamentarians gathered in their elegant chamber at 6 p.m. Friday to vote. Most projections said the amendment would get 98 to 103 votes, even though it was opposed by an unlikely alliance of Mr. Jumblatt's leftists and opposition Christian rightists.</p>
        <p>The legislators who gathered were mostly extraordinarily sleek men in dark suits. Mr. Jumblatt, hereditary feudal leader of the left, in contrast, paired an unaccustomed necktie with his usual leather jacket and stovepipe bluejeans. The Hezbollah legislators from the Shiite fundamentalist party wore suits but no neckties.</p>
        <p>The crucial bloc that could have scuttled the amendment -- a total of 18 votes -- was controlled by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who had feuded with Mr. Lahoud and publicly opposed the constitutional extension. His attitude apparently changed after he met with the Syrian officials on Friday evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri sat in a front-row cabinet seat with his left arm in a sling -- bringing jokes that it had been twisted too hard by the Syrians, although he had actually hurt it in a fall -- as his bloc voted to extend Mr. Lahoud's mandate.</p>
        <p>''What could he do?'' said a Hariri loyalist, with a shrug.</p>
