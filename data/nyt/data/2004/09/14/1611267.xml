        <p>Genes and Baldness</p>
        <p>Q. Is male-pattern baldness inherited through the mother?</p>
        <p>A. It was long thought that inheritance of male-pattern baldness was a fairly simple matter involving a single unidentified dominant gene, and many assumed it was passed on by the mother on the X chromosome. A copy of the form of the gene that predisposes to baldness was thought to mean a man would lose hair in the typical pattern. The gene was believed to have reduced effects or to be recessive in women, who needed two copies for baldness.</p>

        <p>Genes and Baldness</p>
        <p>Q. Is male-pattern baldness inherited through the mother?</p>
        <p>A. It was long thought that inheritance of male-pattern baldness was a fairly simple matter involving a single unidentified dominant gene, and many assumed it was passed on by the mother on the X chromosome. A copy of the form of the gene that predisposes to baldness was thought to mean a man would lose hair in the typical pattern. The gene was believed to have reduced effects or to be recessive in women, who needed two copies for baldness.</p>
        <p>However, this view was based on a relatively small study of 22 families done in 1916, and more recent research suggests a more complex situattion, one involving multiple genes, not necessarily passed on in the maternal line, and one with an additive effect with each gene involved.</p>
        <p>A larger Australian study reported in The Journal of Investigative Dermatology did not identify a candidate gene as the culprit and in fact found no clear pattern of inheritance but noted that there was a relatively strong correspondence between baldness tendencies in fathers and sons.</p>
        <p>However, baldness in the men on either the mother's side or the father's side of the family is associated with a higher chance of developing baldness.</p>
        <p>Male-pattern baldness has been linked to hormone levels, and candidate genes are those involved in androgen production and conversion of androgen into a hormone called dihydrotestosterone.</p>
