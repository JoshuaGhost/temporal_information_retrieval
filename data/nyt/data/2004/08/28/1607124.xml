      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The letter from the International Gymnastics Federation arrived hand-delivered Thursday night, more than a week after Paul Hamm won the men's all-around gymnastics event and felt the weight of the gold medal hanging around his neck.</p>
        <p>In the letter, Bruno Grandi, president of the federation, suggested Hamm give up his Olympic title to Yang Tae Young of South Korea, saying the world would view the gesture as ''the ultimate demonstration of fair play.''</p>
        <p>Grandi reminded Hamm that Yang's score had been miscalculated.</p>
        <p>''As a result,'' Grandi wrote, ''the true winner of the all-around competition is Yang Tae Young.''</p>
        <p>If Hamm were to give back the medal, Grandi suggested, the federation would applaud it. He added, ''You are the only one who can make this decision.''</p>
        <p>Grandi asked the United States Olympic Committee to deliver the letter to Hamm, but incensed U.S.O.C. officials refused. In a news conference Friday, American Olympic officials characterized the letter as ''a blatant and inappropriate attempt'' by the federation to pressure Hamm to resolve the controversy.</p>
        <p>''We have reviewed the action of the International Gymnastics Federation and we think it's deplorable,'' said Peter Ueberroth, the U.S.O.C. chairman. ''They are deflecting their own incompetence.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of any comparison in any sport where you crown an athlete, crown a team and then say: 'Oh, that was a mistake. Would you fix it for us?'''</p>
        <p>Grandi also wrote to Hamm that the gymnastics federation, known as the F.I.G., and the International Olympic Committee ''would highly appreciate the magnitude of this gesture.''</p>
        <p>I.O.C. officials said they did not agree. ''This is not the I.O.C.'s position and we were not consulted about this letter,'' an I.O.C. spokeswoman, Giselle Davies, said. ''The position of the I.O.C. remains the same. The F.I.G. documented and validated the results of the competition and those results will stand.'' The South Koreans said they met Tuesday with Dr. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, who had made his position very clear.</p>
        <p>Hamm left Athens on Wednesday, and he could not be reached Friday at his home in Waukesha, Wis. But his father, Sandy Hamm, said: ''We have no comment whatsoever on everything. That's it. We are done.''</p>
        <p>In the days after the all-around event concluded, the gymnastics federation acknowledged a scoring error on Yang's parallel bars routine after reviewing videotape. One-tenth of a point had been wrongly deducted from the difficulty value of Yang's routine. After discovering the error, the federation suspended the three judges involved.</p>
        <p>After the South Koreans launched their protest last Friday and began their campaign for a shared gold medal, Hamm was hit with a deluge of questions, including whether he would give up or share his medal.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Hamm's final day in Athens, he said he felt alone, left to stand up for himself during the controversy. He said his Olympic experience had been ruined.</p>
        <p>''I felt really horrible that no one was defending me, not USA Gymnastics, not the F.I.G., who caused the whole thing, nobody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C.'s chief executive, Jim Scherr, said the U.S.O.C. accepted some of the blame. ''I think we were at fault for not more strongly, more directly, showing our support for Paul,'' Scherr said. ''I wish we would have done that more strongly and earlier.''</p>
        <p>Early in the controversy, Hamm said he felt ''in his heart'' that he was the rightful Olympic champion, but he said he would have agreed to share the medal if the gymnastic federation had required him to do so.</p>
        <p>During much of the dispute over Yang's score, Grandi said the possibility of a shared gold medal was closed because, according to F.I.G. rules, scores cannot be changed once an event is over. Still, there was precedent for a change. During the trampoline world championships in 2001, the gymnastics federation changed Irina Karavaeva's results at her request, after she learned she won the gold because of a judging error. She gave up her gold medal.</p>
        <p>It seemed the gymnastics federation was looking for the same outcome in Athens. But U.S.O.C. officials would not go along with it. They thought Hamm had been placed in what Scherr called an unfair and ''untenable position.''</p>
        <p>They said the letter from Grandi was an inappropriate request that only continued to cause Hamm grief during a time that should be celebratory. Phone calls on Friday to the gymnastics federation offices were not returned.</p>
        <p>Speaking to The Associated Press, Grandi said: ''He deserves the medal and his ranking is clear. I respect totally Paul Hamm and all the decisions he makes. If he says give back the medal, I respect it. Don't give back the medal, I respect the decision. He is not responsible for anything.''</p>
        <p>Yoo Jae Soon, a spokeswomen for the South Korean delegation, said that she and her colleagues were frustrated with the way the dispute unfolded. She said the Koreans had protested the scores to ensure fairness in the competition, not to hurt the two gymnasts involved, which is how she said things ended up.</p>
        <p>''The F.I.G. said they made a mistake, but no action was taken, so it is the F.I.G.'s leadership's fault and they should solve the problem,'' Yoo said. ''Now Paul is the victim. Tae Young is the victim. Why did the F.I.G. have to make it so stressful and put the athletes in the middle of all the hassles and headaches?''</p>
        <p>Yoo said the South Koreans still planned to file a case with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, in hopes of obtaining a gold medal for Yang. In the meantime, they have requested a clarification of the rules from Grandi. But after communicating with him solely by fax -- because, Yoo said, ''Mr. Bruno Grandi, he is a very difficult person to reach'' -- they have not received a response.</p>
        <p>On the United States' side, Olympic officials are fuming that Grandi sent the letter in the first place.</p>
        <p>''It was a thinly veiled suggestion to our athlete that he should solve the problems of the F.I.G. through his own actions,'' Scherr said. ''We find that request to be a callous disregard for the welfare for one of their own athletes in the F.I.G., as well as our athlete, Paul Hamm.</p>
        <p>''We believe he has competed with honor and dignity and represented our country well and that this matter should be closed.''</p>
        <p>Hamm had won a silver medal in the team competition and came back to win the silver medal in the high bar individual event in his final Olympic event. But the controversy still turned his dream Olympics into a nightmare, prompting him to leave a day early feeling like less than an Olympic champion.</p>
        <p>''We believe that Paul Hamm competed well, competed within the rules and did nothing wrong,'' Scherr said. ''He took no improper action and should have no role in solving this issue. He is the Olympic champion by the results of their own statements. He will always be the Olympic champion.''</p>
