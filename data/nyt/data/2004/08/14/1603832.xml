        <p>Canada's merchandise trade surplus hit a record 8.6 billion Canadian dollars ($6.5 billion) in June, Statistics Canada said. The surplus, which was well above the forecasts of economists, resulted from increased demand worldwide as well as the economic recovery in the United States, the agency said. The government agency said that exports from Canada rose 4.4 percent during June. At the same time, imports fell 3.7 percent. Much of the decline in imports reflected reduced imports of machinery and other equipment, particularly from the United States. Over all, Canadian exports to the United States rose 2.9 percent while purchases from the United States declined 3.6 percent. Canada's trade surplus with the United States stood at 10.7 billion Canadian dollars, its second-highest level in history.</p>
