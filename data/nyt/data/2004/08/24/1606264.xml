        <p>Some New York City schools will face painful budget cuts in the coming academic year, even as education officials said yesterday that they planned to disburse $79 million more to schools over all.</p>
        <p>On Friday, city officials said increased aid from Albany would allow them to restore $60 million in cuts and provide an extra $5 million. That $65 million, they said, coupled with new spending already in the budget, would mean a significant increase for the system as a whole.</p>

        <p>Some New York City schools will face painful budget cuts in the coming academic year, even as education officials said yesterday that they planned to disburse $79 million more to schools over all.</p>
        <p>On Friday, city officials said increased aid from Albany would allow them to restore $60 million in cuts and provide an extra $5 million. That $65 million, they said, coupled with new spending already in the budget, would mean a significant increase for the system as a whole.</p>
        <p>But at a meeting last night of the Panel for Educational Policy, the successor to the Board of Education, officials said that not all schools would have the cuts reversed.</p>
        <p>While the cuts were distributed evenly across the school system, the restorations are being made case by case, taking into account the needs of individual schools.</p>
        <p>So far, officials said, the city has distributed $32 million of the $65 million from the state. The remaining $33 million will be allocated in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>After testimony from parents, teachers, public officials and other advocates who decried budget cuts to their local schools, the panel approved the Education Department's budget by a vote of 7 to 1.</p>
        <p>But even some panel members who voted to approve the budget said they were troubled by reports of cutbacks that are forcing some schools to curtail programs and to eliminate personnel, including teachers' aides and librarians.</p>
        <p>Philip A. Berry, a longtime executive at Colgate-Palmolive who was appointed to the panel by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said just before the vote that after hearing about some of the cuts, ''one just has to wonder and hope that we are doing the right thing.''</p>
        <p>''This is not an easy budget to vote for,'' Mr. Berry added. ''I don't feel good about this.''</p>
        <p>At the meeting, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein sought to alleviate Mr. Berry's concerns, saying, ''I want to assure you that we are flowing the money to the schools in a way that is fair and equitable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein, mentioning the state's failure to comply with a court order mandating additional education money for the city, said the Education Department was doing the best it could. ''I wish there were more resources,'' Mr. Klein said.</p>
        <p>The reductions at some schools are being made for various reasons. Many are part of the department's effort to correct historic inequities.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the cuts are the result of complicated changes to the way school budgets are allocated. In the past, for example, schools received money for special education services based on a percentage of enrollment. Now money is allocated based on the services required by individual students, like speech therapy. School budgets can also decline naturally, to correspond with a reduction in the number of impoverished students, for example, that results in a decline in federal aid.</p>
        <p>In testimony before the panel, City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, a Manhattan Democrat, said several West Side schools were bracing for cutbacks, including Beacon High School, which could be forced to eliminate five teaching positions, and Fiorello La Guardia High School, which she said was struggling to finance music programs. ''We need full restorations,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In her testimony, Randi Weingarten, the president of the city teachers' union, asked why less than a third of the city's $13 billion education budget was being used for basic instructional expenses, like classroom services and supplies.</p>
        <p>''Isn't there a way with $13 billion to put more into classrooms than this?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Education officials used charts and tables to show the planned distribution of $79 million more in the 2004-05 academic year compared with the previous year, including $40 million to help children in danger of failing in the earliest grades, $15 million to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade and $19 million for a variety of programs, including the phasing out of huge high schools in favor of smaller schools.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Klein was so intent on emphasizing these added funds that as the department's chief financial officer, Bruce Feig, seemed to be wrapping up his presentation, the chancellor prompted him: ''You want to say something about the additional monies now?''</p>
