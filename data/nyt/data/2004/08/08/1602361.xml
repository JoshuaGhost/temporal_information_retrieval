        <p>THERE is a good detective story lurking in the exhibition ''Games of the Gods: The Greek Athlete and the Olympic Spirit,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts here through Nov. 28. It involves a work lent by the Kimbell Art Museum, in Fort Worth, a larger-than-life bronze head with the modern title ''Head of an Athlete Cleaning His Scraper (Strigil).'' On its own it is a haunting and somewhat baffling work, but in its temporary digs, surrounded by a supporting cast, this reticent ancient figure turns out to have an engrossing tale to tell, of the adulation paid to ancient athletic heroes and the flourishing art market that catered to a sports-crazed public.</p>
        <p>The beautifully made head depicts a handsome youth in what appears to be a particularly pensive moment. With sensuous lips slightly parted and a concentrated gaze angled down and to the side, he has a Buddha-like air of introspection. The mysterious quality is partly the product of accident; the ivory and dark stone that originally filled the eye sockets are now gone, as is the burnished copper that once accented the lips and eyelashes. What once must have been a startlingly lifelike appearance can be reconstructed to some extent by comparing it to works like the bronze statue of a boy athlete rescued from a wreck near Marathon that retains its inlaid eyes and copper-inset nipples.</p>

        <p>THERE is a good detective story lurking in the exhibition ''Games of the Gods: The Greek Athlete and the Olympic Spirit,'' at the Museum of Fine Arts here through Nov. 28. It involves a work lent by the Kimbell Art Museum, in Fort Worth, a larger-than-life bronze head with the modern title ''Head of an Athlete Cleaning His Scraper (Strigil).'' On its own it is a haunting and somewhat baffling work, but in its temporary digs, surrounded by a supporting cast, this reticent ancient figure turns out to have an engrossing tale to tell, of the adulation paid to ancient athletic heroes and the flourishing art market that catered to a sports-crazed public.</p>
        <p>The beautifully made head depicts a handsome youth in what appears to be a particularly pensive moment. With sensuous lips slightly parted and a concentrated gaze angled down and to the side, he has a Buddha-like air of introspection. The mysterious quality is partly the product of accident; the ivory and dark stone that originally filled the eye sockets are now gone, as is the burnished copper that once accented the lips and eyelashes. What once must have been a startlingly lifelike appearance can be reconstructed to some extent by comparing it to works like the bronze statue of a boy athlete rescued from a wreck near Marathon that retains its inlaid eyes and copper-inset nipples.</p>
        <p>Among the initial perplexities is the title of the work, which suggests a context nowhere apparent in the head itself. It is the hair that provides the first clue to this figure's identity. On top it is a tousled mass as casually chaotic as any bed-headed runway model, while the close-cropped brush over the forehead resembles stylized rows of wheat. To connoisseurs of classical Greek art this is the distinctive coiffure of the athlete, its spiky appearance a result of the olive oil with which he coated his body before his workout and which he is now proceeding to remove with the ladle-shaped instrument known as a strigil.</p>
        <p>The same hairdo can also be seen on a small marble figure, belonging to the Museum of Fine Arts, in an adjacent case. In fact, the figurine, despite its vastly different scale and the less sensitive treatment of the details, is clearly the bronze's double. But because it is attached to an almost complete body (the missing right hand that held the strigil was lost only a few years ago), the figure's intense gaze takes on a new meaning; it no longer seems the faraway stare of a dreamer but the concentrated look of someone absorbed in an apparently mundane task.</p>
        <p>The marble version of the athlete does more than merely provide context for the bronze head: it offers a glimpse of the thriving ancient art market, where famous works were duplicated time and again to feed the insatiable Roman appetite for the older, more refined culture of the Greeks. The composition is known in at least nine separate versions -- including a nearly complete bronze in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and one dredged up a few years ago from the waters of the Adriatic -- which no doubt represent only a small fraction of those that a traveler could once have seen scattered throughout cities across the Roman Empire.</p>
        <p>According to Timothy Potts, director of the Kimbell Art Museum, the relative frequency with which this figure recurs strongly suggests that the original was a famous work by one of the masters of Greek art. Most intriguing is the possibility that these are versions of the renowned Apoxyomenos (an athlete using a strigil), by Lysippos, court sculptor to Alexander the Great. Such was the fame of this work in antiquity that when the emperor Tiberius removed the original from a public bath for his own private viewing pleasure, an angry mob forced him to return it.</p>
        <p>Whether or not the Kimbell head is modeled on this fabled work, it was evidently a famous and much reproduced sculpture in ancient times. A first-century terra-cotta plaque in the exhibition provides a picture of the context in which such monumental bronzes were once displayed. It depicts in rather crude, schematic form a gymnasium -- the civic heart of the Hellenistic and Roman city -- with a row of statues beneath a colonnade.</p>
        <p>Just to the left of center, next to the monumental statue of Herakles -- the mythical founder of the shrine at Olympia where the Olympic games were held -- is a figure whose pose makes him, if not an identical twin, at least a close cousin of the athlete with his strigil.</p>
        <p>It was in such settings that Greeks paid homage to their champions by erecting statues in their honor. Godlike, perfect and serene, this idealized athlete once looked down upon his flesh-and-blood counterparts toiling and sweating below him, his ideal proportions and effortless poise a model and a reproach to lesser beings.</p>
