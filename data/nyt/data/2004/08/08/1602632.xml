        <p>SENATOR John Kerry's failure to get a bounce in the polls after the Democratic convention may have surprised the chattering classes, but not the people who let their money do the talking.</p>
        <p>Political strategists and journalists generally described the convention as a success, especially Mr. Kerry's acceptance speech. The ABC political director, Mark Halperin, called it ''the best speech I've ever seen John Kerry deliver by a mile.'' On CBS, Dan Rather said Mr. Kerry ''seemed to clear the high bar.'' In this column we gave Mr. Kerry the award for most improved performance at the convention.</p>

        <p>Nov. 2 Futures Traded Now</p>
        <p>SENATOR John Kerry's failure to get a bounce in the polls after the Democratic convention may have surprised the chattering classes, but not the people who let their money do the talking.</p>
        <p>Political strategists and journalists generally described the convention as a success, especially Mr. Kerry's acceptance speech. The ABC political director, Mark Halperin, called it ''the best speech I've ever seen John Kerry deliver by a mile.'' On CBS, Dan Rather said Mr. Kerry ''seemed to clear the high bar.'' In this column we gave Mr. Kerry the award for most improved performance at the convention.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, though, traders in political futures were busy shifting their bets to Mr. Bush at two online markets, Intrade and the Iowa Electronic Markets, where tens of thousands of investors spend real money to buy futures contracts.</p>
        <p>The investors started out the summer bullish on Mr. Bush, typically paying about 55 cents for a futures contract that would pay $1 if he wins, which means they gave him a 55 percent chance of victory.</p>
        <p>The price dropped after the selection of John Edwards as Mr. Kerry's running mate, and it fell further the week before the convention. When the delegates arrived in Boston, Mr. Kerry was the slight favorite on both Intrade and the Iowa market. But as the delegates cheered the speeches, the investors had second thoughts.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Kerry's speech Thursday, he was again the underdog, and after his speech the traders continued selling him short. Apparently some traders were underwhelmed by him and the other speakers; perhaps some traders took a look at the television ratings and decided the convention's impact would be less than they anticipated.</p>
        <p>Whatever their calculations, the traders have a good collective track record, said Joyce Berg, the co-director of the Iowa market, which is run by the University of Iowa's business school. In the last four presidential elections, she said, the election-eve trading price has typically been within 1.5 percentage points of the actual result, which is about half a point more accurate than the average election-eve poll.</p>
        <p>And while polls often fluctuate wildly throughout a campaign, the market has tended to be more stable and reliable. Over the course of previous presidential campaigns, Ms. Berg said, about three-quarters of the time the market's daily closing price was a better predictor of the final result than the current polls were.</p>
        <p>Given that history, Mr. Bush has reason for slight optimism this weekend. On Friday, despite a day of bad news on the economy and Iraq, both online markets closed with him a 52 percent favorite to win in November.</p>
        <p>The Politics Of Stem Cells</p>
        <p>A QUICK quiz: Next to John Kerry, which speaker at the convention kept the most political junkies in front of their television sets?</p>
        <p>The answer seems to be Ron Reagan, at least if you go by the preliminary Nielsen ratings for the networks that covered the entire convention. About 10 million people watched his speech on stem cell research on PBS, CNN, Fox and MSNBC, more than for anyone except Mr. Kerry and the speaker who introduced him, Max Cleland.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the viewers were more interested in Mr. Reagan than in his topic, but activists involved in the issue say it has become unexpectedly important this election thanks to Mr. Reagan and his mother, Nancy Reagan, who has also spoken out against current federal policy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Reagan has found a large number of allies on Capitol Hill, including Senator Orrin G. Hatch and other conservatives who side with Mr. Bush on abortion issues but do not share his concern at the use of stem cells from embryos.</p>
        <p>A coalition of scientific societies and other groups opposed to current federal policy is starting a national campaign to pressure political candidates starting tomorrow, the third anniversary of Mr. Bush's decision to put limits on federal money for research involving embryonic stem cells. The activists point to a recent Zogby poll, conducted for American Demographics magazine, in which a fifth of Bush supporters said they would defect if Mr. Kerry proposed a stem cell research initiative.</p>
        <p>In a radio address Saturday, Mr. Kerry promised to end the current limits on stem cell research and said, ''We're going to listen to our scientists and stand up for science.'' The issue may resonate with voters attracted by promises of new treatments for diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes and Alzheimer's, but polling experts caution that the topic is so unfamiliar and complicated that it's impossible to gauge its political impact.</p>
        <p>''The poll results depend how you word the question, but there does seem to be general majority support for the research,'' said Karlyn Bowman, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ''You've got an aging population that's become more aware of the potential of the research, and strongly committed activists with a lot of friends in Washington, and there's the enormous amount of sympathy for the Reagans. But it's not clear how intense the support is and how that translates into votes on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Honor Roll Of the Week</p>
        <p>MOST Overexposed Crop: Corn. It was hard enough before the Iowa caucuses listening to months of speeches extolling the virtues of subsidizing ethanol made from Iowa corn. But last week the candidates' Iowa love affair continued as Mr. Kerry waved corn stalks out the window of his bus and Mr. Bush gobbled his corn on the cob raw.</p>
        <p>Kumbaya Prize, Runner-Up: Teresa Heinz Kerry, for telling an audience in Missouri, ''The only way you solve problems is by holding hands and talking about it. And that's what we want to do in this campaign.''</p>
        <p>Kumbaya Prize: John Kerry, who promised to fight not just a ''more proactive'' but also a ''more sensitive war on terror.''</p>
        <p>Malaprop Medal: President Bush, who unveiled a bold new strategy of pre-emption. ''Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we,'' he said. ''They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.''</p>
