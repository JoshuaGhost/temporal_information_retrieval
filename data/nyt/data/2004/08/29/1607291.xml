        <p>FOR as long as I've been a traveler, I've been a shutterbug. Happily clicking my way through my trips and then assembling photo journals is a fond travel ritual, a way of encountering places along the route and later noting details I may have missed. My shelves overflow with photo scrapbooks of my travels, but I also cherish another resource of recollection. I call them mental snapshots.</p>
        <p>My archive of mental snapshots is growing as I travel more by myself and, like many Americans in these nervous times, travel more by car. Each summer, with my kids blissfully ensconced in sleep-away camp and my wife tied down to her job, I stock up on film, gas up the S.U.V., and head out by my lonesome to see (and photograph) a bit of this vast country. In recent years, the rolling farmlands of Pennsylvania, the bourbon-producing valleys of Kentucky and the tall grasses of the Oklahoma prairie have provided many a visual epiphany.</p>

        <p>FOR as long as I've been a traveler, I've been a shutterbug. Happily clicking my way through my trips and then assembling photo journals is a fond travel ritual, a way of encountering places along the route and later noting details I may have missed. My shelves overflow with photo scrapbooks of my travels, but I also cherish another resource of recollection. I call them mental snapshots.</p>
        <p>My archive of mental snapshots is growing as I travel more by myself and, like many Americans in these nervous times, travel more by car. Each summer, with my kids blissfully ensconced in sleep-away camp and my wife tied down to her job, I stock up on film, gas up the S.U.V., and head out by my lonesome to see (and photograph) a bit of this vast country. In recent years, the rolling farmlands of Pennsylvania, the bourbon-producing valleys of Kentucky and the tall grasses of the Oklahoma prairie have provided many a visual epiphany.</p>
        <p>The solo nature of my drives into the American heartland has forced me to radically adjust how I document my trips. I travel with several cameras, including a little point-and-shoot that I keep handy for catching curiosities that pop up as I drive along. Photographing while driving is admittedly not the safest act (though probably safer than driving while arguing with a teenage daughter on a cellphone), so I often pull over to photograph a funny sign, a memorable building or the sight of golden light rushing across the prairie as it breaks through cobalt blue clouds. But counting the hours and miles as travelers inevitably do, I eventually tire of the stop, snap and go, and pass some great sights by.</p>
        <p>This is when mental snapshots come to the fore. Taking them is very much like the game in which a tray of objects is presented for a few seconds, then you jot down the items you recall. When driving, I ''jot down'' the objects on my mental legal pad.</p>
        <p>Last summer, while driving out West, I applied this technique along the legendary Route 66. This once glorious highway is now largely a graveyard of neon-lighted dreams, dotted with boarded-up drive-ins where the phrase ''Fries with that?'' seems to echo still. As I whizzed past a defunct hamburger stand, I mentally logged in the whimsical curve of its roofline, the harsh light glinting off shattered glass panels, and an angry dash of red graffiti on the weathered plywood over the once busy service window. In a flash, I was past the drive-in, but it remains a memorable image.</p>
        <p>In many ways, not taking a photograph enhances one's memory of something striking because it intensifies concentration. By not relying on a camera to see for us, we may see more sharply.</p>
        <p>I recall with great clarity some of the novelties that I did not photograph but, rather, house in the image bank in my cranium. One was a sign by a creek that read ''No Shooting From Bridge'' that, naturally, was riddled with bullet holes. Then there was a roadside taproom crowned with a sign larger than the building itself. It shouted: ''Chicken and Beer.'' The heavy scent of fried chicken enhanced the visual effect as I passed it by, two hands on the wheel.</p>
        <p>Many sights became mental snapshots because they called out to me with irony, poignancy or because they squared with general expectations of what is typical for a region. While driving through the declining downtown of a dusty Oklahoma hamlet, I was struck by a prominent sign: ''Tuxedo Rentals.'' A moment later, I passed a beauty salon housed in a Quonset hut covered with dents, holes and rust spots. The words ''Closed for Remodeling'' were hastily spray painted on the front door. ''Whoa,'' I said, chuckling at the expense of the salon's ambitious owners, ''No way to go but up!'' Just past town, I spied a yellow Victorian farmhouse set by a curvy river with red clay banks exposed by the summer drought. It was achingly perfect, like a set for ''Oklahoma!''</p>
        <p>My mental camera furiously snapped away at these sights, but I began to question whether I take photos -- mental or physical -- to understand life better or simply to reinforce photographic stereotypes. Many pictures I take are like those I've taken or seen before. Snapping a picture is like putting an experience in your pocket and taking it home. A mental snapshot is much the same, though it requires more-direct engagement with that experience and more effort to maintain it in memory.</p>
        <p>Today, when I share the experience of my road trip with friends, I show them the prints in my scrapbook. My mental snapshots, however, more accurately reflect the trip itself, the banality of vinyl-clad homes, the standardized layout of convenience stores and the ennui of traveling alone.</p>
        <p>On my way to visit a former cavalry fort, I passed a rusty sign of a cowboy advising: ''Watch Your Curves! Eat More BEEF.'' I was past it before I caught the full meaning of its folksy humor (and Atkins topicality). While I had captured a mental snapshot of the sign glowing in buttery morning sunlight, it bugged me that I hadn't trained a lens on it.</p>
        <p>After visiting the fort, I looped back and pulled to a stop by the rusty sign. Even as I set up my camera and fiddled with filters, I knew I wouldn't get a good shot. The sky had clouded over, and the moment was gone. I have a few prints of the sign, dark and literal, but they don't compare with the earlier photo that's seared into my mind. In my mental snapshot, the cowboy in the morning sunlight always makes me smile.</p>
