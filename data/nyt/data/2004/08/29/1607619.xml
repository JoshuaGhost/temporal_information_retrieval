      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Two New York City men were charged yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn with conspiring to set off a bomb in the subway station at Herald Square, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>The men, who were identified in court papers as Shahawar Matin Siraj, 22, of Queens, and James Elshafay, 19, of Staten Island, 19, twice conducted surveillance of the station, including once last week, drawing diagrams of the entrances and exits, the officials said.</p>
        <p>But Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and other officials stressed yesterday that the men had obtained no explosives and had set no specific time for any attack, and that it was unclear how far their plans had actually progressed. A news release announcing the arrests said they were not connected to earlier intelligence that Al Qaeda was seeking to attack financial targets in New York before the election.</p>
        <p>The officials also said they did not believe the plot involving the station, at 34th Street and Avenue of the Americas, was timed to coincide with the Republican National Convention, which opens tomorrow at Madison Square Garden, a block away.</p>
        <p>''There was no timeline, they had no explosives, they were under surveillance,'' Commissioner Kelly said. ''There's a lot of people concerned because of the level of hatred that's out there.''</p>
        <p>Last September, a paid police informant began having conversations with the two men, and about eight months later, Mr. Siraj began talking to the informant about setting off bombs in the New York City area and ''doing harm to United States military personnel and law enforcement officers,'' according to a complaint filed yesterday by federal prosecutors. It provided no details about the informant or how he met the men.</p>
        <p>The complaint did say that the informant, at the instruction of law enforcement officials, told the two men he was a member of an Islamic ''brotherhood'' that had approved their mission. The brotherhood, according to the complaint, did not exist.</p>
        <p>During some conversations, the men ''at times stated that they wanted to cause economic harm and disruption but that they wanted to avoid killing anyone.''</p>
        <p>But in tape-recorded conversations with the informant this month, both men can be heard repeatedly discussing plans to plant bombs on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and in subway stations, according to the complaint, and Mr. Elshafay had drawn a map of the bridges and police precincts on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The complaint also says that at one point Mr. Siraj declared he was ''ready for jihad,'' and that in another taped conversation, Mr. Elshafay declared his hatred of ''Zionists'' and expressed ''solidarity with the Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>''This is an investigation that started about a year ago. This was managed by our intelligence division,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Siraj had been making increasingly militant statements about damaging public facilities, specifically transportation facilities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly added that ''backpacks were obtained with the intent of putting explosives in the backpacks.'' He said other subway stations, at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street and at 42nd Street, were also discussed as possible targets.</p>
        <p>The police arrested the two men on Friday, and they were arraigned yesterday morning on federal charges in connection with the bomb plot before Kiyo Matsumoto, a federal magistrate judge, who ordered them held without bail on charges that they conspired to use explosives to destroy a building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Siraj, who studies computer networking in Queens two days a week, came to the United States from Karachi, Pakistan, about five years ago, said his uncle, Saleem Noorali, owner of the Islamic Books and Tapes store on Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Mr. Noorali said his nephew worked in the bookstore six days a week from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>''When would he have time to do these things?'' Mr. Noorali said, referring to the charges. ''It's false information. I don't see any evidence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Noorali was standing outside the courthouse with Mr. Siraj's father, Siraj Abdul Rehman, who also works at the bookstore. In broken English, Mr. Rehman said his son was innocent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elshafay's mother left the courthouse in tears, pursued by reporters. Without giving her name, she denied the charges against her son, saying: ''We're proud to be Americans -- that's all I can say.''</p>
        <p>The arrests come at a time of heightened concerns across the city because of the Republican convention.</p>
        <p>Although one high-ranking police official said the men were not linked to Al Qaeda or any known terrorist group, he said they were nonetheless representative of disenfranchised young Muslim men in the city who had become more radical by listening to sermons preaching jihad.</p>
        <p>The official said such men were as capable of violence as organized terrorist groups. ''What we have to be looking for is an organized attack like 9/11, but also disenfranchised people who are equally capable of committing violent acts,'' the official said, citing the Egyptian immigrant who shot and killed two people at an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport in 2002 and the English teacher from Gaza who went on a shooting rampage on the Empire State Building observation deck in 1997, killing a Danish tourist and wounding six other people. The man left behind a letter revealing his seething anger at the treatment of Palestinians by the United States, Israel and other countries.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Robin L'Hussier, 35, a legal secretary from Queens, was waiting with two friends for a train at the Herald Square station.</p>
        <p>''What scares me is what we don't know,'' she said. ''What hasn't been uncovered.''</p>
