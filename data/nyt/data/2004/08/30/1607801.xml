        <p>EBay begins using its site to promote dropoff stores that list, package and ship eBay items for people who cannot be bothered to do it themselves; is treading carefully, partly because it has no direct financial stake in auction dropoff businesses, which charge commissions of about 30 percent of items they sell; hopes to attract more sellers, since roughly 90 percent of its 114 million registered users are buyers; there are at least 1,000 dropoff stores; AuctionDrop is gaining momentum through agreement with United Parcel Service; photo (M)</p>

        <p>EBAY dropoff stores, which list, package and ship eBay items for people who cannot be bothered to do it themselves, have gotten a little help in their quest to find a market -- from eBay itself.</p>
        <p>Anyone looking for the stores would have, until recently, found almost nothing on eBay, even though at least 1,000 such stores exist solely to list more goods on eBay. But dropoff store operators say that some changes this month suggest that eBay could be steering them to more profitable waters. The company has begun promoting the stores on its site, listing them in a public database and creating standards of conduct to help keep sellers from handing their goods over to the wrong people.</p>
        <p>''This will give us visibility we need,'' said Jack Reynolds, a founder of QuikDrop International, a dropoff store franchise based in Costa Mesa, Calif.</p>
        <p>As a market, the dropoff stores are unproved, but Hani Durzy, an eBay spokesman, said the company was ''excited about the possibilities for these stores.''</p>
        <p>''We're watching intently,'' Mr. Durzy said, ''and figuring out what's the best way to support them without getting in their way.''</p>
        <p>He said eBay was treading carefully, partly because it had no direct financial stake in the auction dropoff businesses, which charge commissions of about 30 percent on items they sell. Last year, eBay said it would not open similar outlets, though such a move could conceivably increase the number of sellers on its site.</p>
        <p>Of eBay's 114 million registered users, roughly 90 percent are buyers, auction industry officials said. EBay would like to attract more sellers, but many people are unwilling or unable to take digital photos of their items, write competent descriptions and post the products on eBay for sale. New eBay sellers are also more skeptically regarded and their items fetch lower prices because they have no track record of successful transactions with which to market themselves.</p>
        <p>An army of auction assistants, typically individuals or small enterprises with experience selling their goods on eBay, has long stood ready to help sellers overcome such hurdles. More recently, though, some operations have started opening physical dropoff locations, and some of the more ambitious operations, like QuikDrop, AuctionDrop and iSold It, have begun expanding nationally.</p>
        <p>Even Circuit City has joined in. This spring, as part of a yearlong experiment, it opened what it calls Trading Circuits in eight stores.</p>
        <p>Although dropoff store operators say publicly that eBay has been supportive, they acknowledge privately that they could use more help. Still, if eBay's recent initiatives will not by themselves establish this nascent market, its actions could give the companies a lift.</p>
        <p>Take the new listing function, for instance. Since 2002, users who visit eBay's trading assistants page (ebay.com/ta) have been offered a search box to help find assistants near a given ZIP code. This month, eBay added a clickable box to help users find a listing of dropoff locations.</p>
        <p>The company also said it would build a more comprehensive program around trading posts -- eBay parlance for dropoff locations. To be designated a trading post, sellers must attract feedback from 500 buyers and generate monthly eBay sales of at least $25,000. Mr. Durzy said eBay would also establish customer satisfaction thresholds to keep less proficient or less scrupulous sellers off the list.</p>
        <p>Scott Kessler, an Internet equity analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's, said that the auction dropoff industry would sell about $14 million worth of items on eBay this year, but that figure was expected to grow. ''This also gives eBay the potential to win more users,'' he said, ''since these sellers will probably start following their auctions on the site.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler said that of the dropoff companies, AuctionDrop had gained the most momentum this year, because of its agreement with the United Parcel Service. That deal, which went into effect in late June, gives AuctionDrop a presence in 3,300 U.P.S. stores. Customers bring auction items to U.P.S. locations for free shipping to AuctionDrop's warehouse in Fremont, Calif., where the goods are inspected, photographed, described and placed on auction.</p>
        <p>If the item cannot be sold or if its value is less than $75, it is shipped back to the prospective seller without charge. If it sells, AuctionDrop keeps 20 to 38 percent of the final price.</p>
        <p>Randy Adams, AuctionDrop's chief executive, said the company had raised $17 million from investors so far, and would raise more money for marketing later this year, after it has the results of a test advertising campaign in Chicago that began late last month. So far, he said, that effort has resulted in ''the best U.P.S. stores doing one or two items a day, which is fine for us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds, of QuikDrop, said his company had also been growing, albeit slowly. Since its first store opened in California in February, QuikDrop has added 13 franchise locations in Australia as well as Illinois, Kentucky, New York, Texas and Virginia, and plans to open an additional 50 stores by year-end. Mr. Reynolds said he had signed contracts with franchisees to open 500 more stores within two to three years.</p>
        <p>Franchisees pay $17,000 to open a store ($15,000 of which can be amortized over 15 years), and a flat-rate royalty fee of $1,800 a month. To break even, Mr. Reynolds said, store owners must sell $35,000 to $40,000 of goods each month. While Mr. Reynolds would not disclose the average selling prices for items, he said the typical store sold 20 and 50 items a day.</p>
        <p>Store owners and their employees record the seller's driver's license number, to minimize the chances of handling stolen goods, before getting the items ready for auction.</p>
        <p>After the item is shipped, its buyer has three days to inspect it and make sure the item was accurately represented on eBay. ''Our only real guarantee is that the item we ship is the one we photograph,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''If it's a Rolex, we say, 'This is what the customer brought in, and this is what they say it is.'''</p>
        <p>Both AuctionDrop and iSold It, a franchise based in Pasadena, Calif., are hoping that more thorough inspections and more generous guarantees will help them compete with companies like QuikDrop -- particularly in an auction market where many customers are already concerned about the possibility of buying counterfeit items.</p>
        <p>Elise Wetzel, the founder of iSold It, said that, when possible, the company checked to make sure items were working. ''If it's scuba equipment, we can't possibly test that,'' she said. But the company does offer a guarantee to buyers, who have three days to notify the store if they intend to return goods. After three days, iSold It sends a check to the seller.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wetzel, who also co-founded the Wetzel's Pretzels franchise, said she recently sold her 200th franchise (franchises cost $15,000 apiece), six months after selling her first. Six stores are open, and 44 more are expected to open by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The stores, which accept items worth $30 or more and weighing 150 pounds or less, are doing a brisk business in cameras, musical instruments and sporting goods, Ms. Wetzel said. The stores may also eventually expand into heavier items -- specifically, cars, which have become one of eBay's most lucrative niches.</p>
        <p>''We can take pictures of cars, too,'' Ms. Wetzel said. ''We just wouldn't keep them in our parking lot.''</p>
