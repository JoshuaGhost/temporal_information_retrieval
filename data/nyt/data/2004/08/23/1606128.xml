        <p>A woman ejected from a sport utility vehicle on the Belt Parkway in South Ozone Park on Saturday night was struck and killed by a second vehicle whose driver, after stopping to check her pulse, drove off, the police said. The driver of the S.U.V., identified as Keith Haigbea, 38, of 166th Place in Jamaica, was charged with second-degree manslaughter, said a spokesman for the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. The authorities said that Mr. Haigbea had been drinking and that additional charges were possible pending the results of a blood alcohol test. Mr. Haigbea lost control of the vehicle around 10:35 p.m. in the eastbound lanes of the parkway near Exit 20 and the vehicle flipped over, a law enforcement official said. The woman, identified as Tammy Cromer, 32, of Brooklyn, was ejected onto the westbound lanes, where she was struck by a red Mercury Cougar, the police said. The driver of the Cougar stopped long enough to check Ms. Cromer's pulse before fleeing, the police said. Ms. Cromer, whom the authorities said was Mr. Haigbea's girlfriend, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her two daughters, ages 9 and 12, who were in the back seat, were treated for minor injuries.</p>
