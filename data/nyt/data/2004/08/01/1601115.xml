        <p>After weeks of intense speculation that the Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson would be traded to the Yankees or another contender before yesterday's nonwaiver deadline, he never budged.</p>
        <p>But Boston's Nomar Garciaparra and Steve Finley, Johnson's teammate, were among the marquee players who learned yesterday that they would have new baseball addresses.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox traded one of their most popular and most unhappy players by sending Garciaparra to the Chicago Cubs in a four-team deal that brought them shortstop Orlando Cabrera and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz. Garciaparra, a shortstop, was nearly traded to the Chicago White Sox in December because the Red Sox were close to acquiring Alex Rodriguez from the Texas Rangers.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox botched the acquisition of Rodriguez, who ended up with the Yankees, and their relationship with Garciaparra was strained. Garciaparra can be a free agent after this season, and he was unlikely to re-sign with Boston.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox initially hoped to move Garciaparra to the Cubs and use the players they received to help obtain Johnson. That plan fizzled, but they still wound up unloading a player who was simply identified as ''Nomah'' throughout New England.</p>
        <p>''That's surprising,'' Rodriguez said. ''Nomar is an icon player, and he's been an icon player for a long time.''</p>
        <p>In exchange for Garciaparra, a minor league outfielder and cash, the Red Sox secured Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins. Both are Gold Glove winners and should help upgrade the Red Sox' erratic defense. The Red Sox led the major leagues in unearned runs through Friday, and only five other teams had more errors. Although they lost a two-time batting champion by trading Garciaparra, they addressed a glaring weakness.</p>
        <p>The rest of the trade included the Cubs dispatching shortstop Alex Gonzalez, reliever Francis Beltran and infielder Brendan Harris to Montreal and sending the minor league pitcher Justin Jones to the Twins.</p>
        <p>But Garciaparra, who turned down a four-year, $60 million offer from Boston last winter, was the most compelling player who moved.</p>
        <p>''I think he will bring a ton to the table and a presence on the field and off,'' Cubs General Manager Jim Hendry told The Associated Press. ''You never go to work thinking he's going to be available.''</p>
        <p>Garciaparra told The A.P., ''If it was in my control, I'd still be wearing a Red Sox uniform,'' but he added that ''I'm going to a phenomenal city with great tradition as well, phenomenal fans, great organization.''</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers executed a six-player deal with the Florida Marlins on Friday night with the hopes of using the players they obtained in a deal for the 40-year-old Johnson. But the Dodgers and the Diamondbacks could not agree to a trade.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers did acquire Finley, the Diamondbacks' center fielder, who waived his no-trade clause to go from the last-place team in the National League West to its first-place team. Finley's arrival will bump Milton Bradley out of center. Los Angeles then traded outfielder Dave Roberts to the Red Sox for a minor league outfielder.</p>
        <p>Weary of Jos√© Contreras's inconsistency, the Yankees traded him and cash to the White Sox for Esteban Loaiza, who started for the American League in the All-Star Game last season and won 21 games. He has not been as stellar this season with a 9-5 record, but Loaiza is more of a certainty than Contreras, who has failed so miserably against the Red Sox that the Yankees decided they could no longer think of relying on him in crucial games.</p>
        <p>Arizona's failure to shed Johnson and the $22 million he is owed through 2005 indicates that Arizona disliked the offers for Johnson, one of the premier pitchers in baseball, and that the Diamondbacks thought they could regroup and possibly contend next season. They have the worst record in the majors, but they say they hope to re-sign Finley and Richie Sexson, who will be free agents.</p>
        <p>Of course, Arizona, which wanted a hefty sum for Johnson, could also still try to move him in the off-season.</p>
        <p>''No one in the front office came to me and said 'this is what we have on the table: Would you like to go here or not?''' Johnson, who has a no-trade clause, told The A.P.</p>
        <p>''That never happened yesterday, it never happened today and I never vetoed any trade,'' he said, denying, in effect, that he had told the Diamondbacks that he would consider a trade only to the Yankees. Arizona barely negotiated with the Yankees because of their dearth of prospects who are ready for the major leagues.</p>
        <p>The Dodgers gambled by trading catcher Paul Lo Duca, reliever Guillermo Mota and outfielder Juan Encarnacion to the Marlins for pitcher Brad Penny, first baseman Hee Seop Choi and the minor league pitcher Bill Murphy. Los Angeles hoped to use the three new players as part of proposals to get Johnson and Finley. But they went 1 for 2, and the miss was a big one. They sent Murphy to the Diamondbacks in the Finley trade.</p>
        <p>So the first-place Dodgers, who had won 21 of their last 27 games before last night, have revamped their team in a questionable way. They lost Lo Duca, one of their most inspirational players, and Mota, who combined with Eric Gagne to give the Dodgers a deep bullpen. The Dodgers tried to get Colorado's Charles Johnson to replace Lo Duca, but he declined to waive his no-trade clause.</p>
        <p>The defending World Series champion Marlins obtained starter Ismael Valdez from the San Diego Padres for the minor league pitcher Travis Chuck, and they received reliever Rudy Seanez from the Kansas City Royals for outfielder Abraham Nu√±ez.The Mets sent pitcher Scott Erickson and cash to Texas for a player to be named.</p>
