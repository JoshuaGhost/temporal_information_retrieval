        <p>A PATCH of land bought by the Village of Tarrytown for use as a park has recently turned into more of a battleground.</p>
        <p>Proponents say the purchase represented a rare opportunity to preserve a vest-pocket park in Tarrytown's densely populated inner village. But foes, citing the high cost and scant acreage, see village mismanagement.</p>
        <p>''No one objects to open space,'' said Linda Viertel, who served on the village's Open Space Committee, ''but I oppose the process and the lack of fiscal responsibility.''</p>
        <p>In a 2001 referendum, voters overwhelmingly approved a $3 million bond for an Open Space Fund. Open Space Committee members looked at nine properties totaling 200 acres; the one they recommended was a 1.5-acre meadow along Neperan Road. The snag was the high asking price, $1.6 million, and the fact that the seller insisted on also including a small patch of contiguous land -- a .9-acre wooded area less desirable as a park.</p>
        <p>The price was steep, but there was a way to offset it: the wooded area could be divided into three building lots and sold to replenish the fund, which would then be used to buy more public land. By unanimous vote a year ago, the board authorized the expense and bought the whole 2.4 acres.</p>
        <p>Then, last March, Mayor Paul Janos and three trustees did an about-face, authorizing the drafting of a legal measure called a conservation easement, which forbids future development of any part of the property.</p>
        <p>The plan to sell off the wooded area was thus effectively scotched, and its backers cried foul, accusing the mayor and the trustees of secretly railroading their measure. Mayor Janos did not return calls seeking comment for this article.</p>
        <p>Suspicions were further fueled by the knowledge that one of the three trustees who backed the conservation easement, Susan Sincero, lives directly across the street from the disputed woods.</p>
        <p>Two fellow trustees, Drew Fixell and Dennis Chillemi, say they see a conflict of interest, arguing that Ms. Sincero should have recused herself from any vote on the Neperan Road site because her property values would be directly affected by whatever transpired there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sincero said she had consulted lawyers, who had assured her that there was no conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>''We've been talking about this for years and years and it's time to fish or cut bait,'' she said. ''I don't think you buy open space and sell it. That's not what preservation is all about. This is about giving a very dense part of the village some breathing room.''</p>
        <p>Two other vocal opponents of selling the wood area also live in close proximity to it: Michael Farley, an Open Space Committee member; and Robert Bonvento, the influential publisher and editor of The River Journal, a local monthly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley asserts that he doesn't see the point of replenishing the fund by selling the woods. ''What are we going to do with the Open Space Fund, keep it forever?'' he asked. ''This was the only plot recommended by the committee that came up for sale.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Viertel counters that open-space money is ''rarely'' for wholesale purchases but is instead ''for leveraging and getting other funds through matching grants.''</p>
        <p>As an example of what the village has done right in this regard, she cited its recent $250,000 purchase of 4.5 acres in the south end, where she lives. The seller of that land, the Unification Church, still owns adjacent property that it wants to develop. By entering into the deal with the village, it has won approval for the development, but in modified form: the church will cluster the houses it builds, ultimately helping the village to increase the total acreage of public land at the site.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Bonvento, the May issue of his publication ran three letters in support of keeping the wooded area intact. One of them, written by Ms. Sincero, accused some of her opponents of grandstanding.</p>
        <p>Another trustee, Thomas Basher, called the paper a mouthpiece for Mr. Bonvento's views.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonvento countered that in a future issue, the paper would run a letter from Mr. Chillemi, Mr. Basher and Mr. Fixell, although he plans to accompany it with a counterpoint.</p>
        <p>His reasons for keeping the park intact: the digging of any foundations might disturb the high groundwater table; the steep slope on the parcel presents potential drainage problems; and the wooded area serves as a habitat for birds.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Fixell, the trustee, has presented a compromise proposal, which has yet to be considered by the board. It would declare the 1.5-acre meadow a park, conduct an appraisal of the remaining .9 acre and credit the value, up to $850,000, to the Open Space Fund for other purchases. A one-year moratorium would be declared on any decision to sell the wooded parcel, during which time the board would try to find alternative sources to compensate for the amount credited to the fund.</p>
        <p>''I think the struggle we're seeing now is part of the growing pains associated with putting together an organized and comprehensive open-space policy,'' said Paul Gallay, executive director of the Westchester Land Trust, which advised the village and would be the potential nonprofit partner if the conservation easement process was completed. ''There is a limited amount of funding available, and there are strong interests in each part of the community.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Gallay added, the dispute may eventually bring some good. ''Neperan Road represents a big price tag relative to size, but not to the importance of the property,'' he said. ''Out of this conflict could come a wise use of the remaining open space funds.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 15, 2004, Sunday  An article on Aug. 1 about disputed parkland in Tarrytown referred imprecisely to the role of Michael Farley, a resident, in the village's decision to buy the land. He was on the committee that worked to create the Open Space Fund, but he was not on the committee that used the Open Space Fund to buy the parkland.</p>
