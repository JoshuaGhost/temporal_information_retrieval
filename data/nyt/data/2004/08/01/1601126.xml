        <p>Just a year after being scheduled for extinction, the State Council on the Arts announced a record $22.7 million in grants last week for more than 700 groups and individuals. The big winners were the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which will receive $1.76 million; the Performing Arts Center, $1.65 million; the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, $1.14 million; and McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, $825,000. Fourteen folk artist apprentice grants were awarded to people whose talents range from decoy carving to Chinese knotting. Last year, financing was eliminated for the arts council until a lobbying effort managed to restore $16 million. This year, part of a new state fee on overnight hotel and motel rooms is going toward arts spending.</p>
