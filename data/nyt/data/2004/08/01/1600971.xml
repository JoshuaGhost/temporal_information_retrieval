        <p>She may still be the ''Queen of Mean'' to some people, but Leona M. Helmsley has a soft spot for animals. And she wants to show that to New York by financing the construction of a nonprofit animal hospital.</p>
        <p>This may come as a surprise to those who remember Mrs. Helmsley, heir to Harry B. Helmsley's fortune, as the arrogant and wrathful matron of the Helmsley hotel chain. To many, she remains a symbol of unfeeling hubris.</p>
        <p>''We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes,'' is the infamous quote attributed to her by a former housekeeper when Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of tax evasion in the early 1990's. She served 18 months in prison.</p>
        <p>Her reputation suffered anew in 2002, when a former employee sued Mrs. Helmsley, saying she had fired him because he is gay. A jury awarded the plaintiff $11.7 million after a three-week trial in January 2003, but a judge later reduced the amount to $554,000, along with $638,000 in legal fees and expenses.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Helmsley, now 84, can well afford to pay that -- and her taxes, too. Her real estate holdings, including the Park Lane Hotel, where she lives, are worth an estimated $4 billion, and she ranks 247th on Forbes's list of the world's richest people.</p>
        <p>She declined to be interviewed in person for this article, agreeing only to respond to questions through her longtime spokesman, Harry Rubenstein.</p>
        <p>''She is still in charge and she makes decisions with a group of advisers,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''Most of her buildings are held in partnership form and the partners have supervisors. She loves the Park Lane, which she owns without a partner. She watches over the kitchen, the elevators and does her own inspections of the rooms. Sometimes she greets patrons.''</p>
        <p>And she loves her pet, a Maltese named Trouble, who appears in advertisements for the Park Lane. Mrs. Helmsley's idea to build an animal hospital -- a project she said she had begun to consider recently -- is aimed at helping creatures less fortunate than her pampered companion, Mr. Rubenstein said.</p>
        <p>Those pets would presumably be owned by people who may pay taxes but can't afford to stay at the Park Lane.</p>
