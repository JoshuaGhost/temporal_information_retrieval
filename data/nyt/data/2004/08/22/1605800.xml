        <p>DID Google take Wall Street, or vice versa?</p>
        <p>Much has been made of the cut-rate fees Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston accepted to underwrite Google's initial public offering. Instead of 7 percent of the offering's total --the industry standard -- the banks were strong-armed by the Wall Street-hating founders of Google into taking a measly fee of 2.8 percent of the $1.67 billion raised in the auction.</p>

        <p>DID Google take Wall Street, or vice versa?</p>
        <p>Much has been made of the cut-rate fees Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston accepted to underwrite Google's initial public offering. Instead of 7 percent of the offering's total --the industry standard -- the banks were strong-armed by the Wall Street-hating founders of Google into taking a measly fee of 2.8 percent of the $1.67 billion raised in the auction.</p>
        <p>That's not chump change -- the banks divvied up some $47 million -- but for an industry that is watching its profits erode, the deal has some nervous bankers grumbling. In fact, after paying to build complex new computer systems to manage the unorthodox auction and doling out ridiculously outsized salaries to the bankers who have worked on the offering for nearly a year, the banks won't make much, if anything, on the deal.</p>
        <p>But critics of the banks miss the point. The I.P.O. was never about the money. It was a loss leader for the next deal -- the Google Gravy Train to come or, in Hollywood parlance, a piece of the back end. In the next several months and even years, Google will probably be unloading millions of additional shares on the stock market. You can bet your lunch reservations at the Four Seasons that Morgan Stanley and First Boston will be at the head of the line to do those secondary offerings -- and they won't be accepting the same stingy fees.</p>
        <p>That's just the start. The banks' private wealth management groups are sure to be cozying up to some 2,000 Google employees who have become millionaires on paper, hoping to manage their new fortunes. And yes -- ka-ching -- they will charge a no-discount fee, too.</p>
        <p>The banks also plan to lend a helping hand to those employees selling shares, taking a commission with every transaction. Next month, the first set of lockup agreements restricting the sale of shares by current and former employees will expire, opening the floodgates on 4.6 million shares. Another lockup period expires in 90 days, potentially putting 38.5 million more shares in play. And 24.3 million more shares could hit the market after 120 days and an additional 24.3 million in 150 days. The biggest wave is after 180 days, when 171 million more shares will become unrestricted.</p>
        <p>Google's founders, Sergey Brin, 30, and Larry Page, 31, each sold fewer than half a million shares, or 1.25 percent of their holdings. They had planned to sell much more into the initial offering, but decided at the last minute to hold onto them because of worries that demand was weaker than expected. Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, 49, sold just 2.5 percent of his holdings rather than the 5 percent he had planned to unload. They are all sure to be selling more soon.</p>
        <p>Then there are the venture capital firms: Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers had originally planned to sell 10 percent of their holdings in the company, a total of 4.5 million shares, but decided to hold on. They won't sit on the sidelines much longer. Their business model calls for them to ''exit'' their investments eventually. And Morgan Stanley and First Boston would sure like to help.</p>
        <p>Now that Google has so much cash, it is likely to dip its toe into mergers and acquisitions -- music to the ears of investment bankers. Again, you can bet that Morgan Stanley and First Boston will expect a seat at the table. And some fat advisory fees.</p>
        <p>BUT will Morgan Stanley and First Boston get all or any of this business, given the messy valuations and other embarrassing setbacks throughout the Google I.P.O. process? Or will Google use Goldman Sachs or some other bank?</p>
        <p>For the past several weeks, there has been finger-pointing among Google's management, the venture capitalists and the bankers about setting I.P.O. expectations too high. Will the bankers be held accountable? Can they? After all, it was Google's founders who wanted to pursue the unorthodox auction and who, by all accounts, have tried to run it their way.</p>
        <p>But Morgan Stanley and First Boston still seem to have an advantage. Unlike Goldman Sachs, which railed against the auction concept when they pitched Google during a bake-off earlier this year, Morgan Stanley and First Boston took on the challenge when Google asked them to think outside the box regarding the I.P.O. So with the offering now complete -- and so far successful -- you can forgive the banks for wanting to press the ''I'm feeling lucky'' key.</p>
