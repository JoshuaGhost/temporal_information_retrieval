        <p>A MAN'S GUIDE</p>
        <p>TO A CIVILIZED DIVORCE</p>
        <p>How to Divorce With Grace, a Little Class, and a Lot of Common Sense.</p>
        <p>By Sam Margulies.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 338 pp. Rodale. $24.95.</p>
        <p>WHATEVER happened to the ''I'm O.K. -- You're O.K.'' brevity of the self-help title? Today's guides make one feel virtuous just for finishing off the cover. For readers of divorce how-to's, reeling from collapsed marriages, such a swift palliative would be welcome.</p>
        <p>But ''A Man's Guide to a Civilized Divorce: How to Divorce With Grace, a Little Class, and a Lot of Common Sense'' offers 338 pages more than that. While some his-and-hers divorce books make no pretense of neutrality (''Divorce War! 50 Strategies Every Woman Needs to Know to Win,'' ''The Father's Emergency Guide to Divorce-Custody Battle: A Tour Through the Predatory World of Judges, Lawyers, Psychologists and Social Workers, in the Subculture of Divorce'' and the like), Sam Margulies, a lawyer and practicing mediator, says the divorce process need not be combative. Fighting to ''win'' is costly and personally damaging at best, counterproductive to alimony and custody aims at worst. Neatly skirting the probability that a harmonious split may not follow an antagonistic marriage, Margulies argues that nearly all divorcing couples can choose to have a good divorce -- even if they have to grit their teeth through ''counterintuitive'' behaviors in the process. (What, no name-calling?)</p>
        <p>Despite all this well-intentioned equanimity, Margulies infuses his book with indignation. It opens with the statistic that most divorces are initiated by women, and this change, the author postulates, is not because men are more adulterous or less amorous but because women are unhappier with their marriages. Wives' unhappiness, in turn, arises from gauzy expectations of unfettered intimacy, which, not surprisingly, most red-blooded males don't know how to provide. ''Traditional expectations of men are clearly under assault,'' Margulies writes. ''Men are expected to be aggressive yet gentle, to be good providers but also be nurturing at home, and to be manly but temper it with visible displays of emotional sensitivity.'' With his shrug at female demands, Margulies sometimes comes across as the man's man's mediator; other times, he sounds condescending: ''Going to a self-service laundry and seeking advice from an attractive woman on how to use fabric softener may get you more than clean clothes,'' he advises the divorc√© on the prowl.</p>
        <p>Men need a new divorce guide, it appears, because marriage and manhood have changed. And it seems men and women dislike the new ''equality'' equally. Men fear their inability to serve up a sufficient marriage of peers; women are galled when such marriages fall apart -- and they find out they might have to pay alimony. Men resent a system that demands equal marriage but doles out divorce unequally, with women typically keeping both house and kids. Women are appalled that though they berated their husbands for not changing their fair share of diapers, they, mothers superior, could end up with less than full custody. Peer divorce, alas, can leave both camps feeling cheated.</p>
        <p>Most of the book's advice in navigating these new rules is sound. According to Margulies, the legal system exacerbates the acrimony. Best for the dividing couple to compromise outside the courthouse, and the author gives ample information to that end. Using case studies to illustrate his points, Margulies outlines a chronological and emotional blueprint for the good divorce, with chapters devoted to divorce law and lawyers, mediation and divorced fatherhood. The book addresses many practical considerations: if and when to move out of the marital home, how to negotiate custody arrangements and alimony and ways to budget for post-divorce life, with workbook-style charts to assist. Still, were it not leavened with cartoons and occasionally, if inadvertently, amusing anecdotes (e.g., the woman who begins an adulterous affair with the childhood love she bumps into at a square-dance retreat), the book, despite its useful and practical advice, would be rather disheartening.</p>
        <p>Even so, there is something moving about a man diligently poring over the steps to a friendly divorce, penciling in figures to separate his financial assets from his wife's and preparing himself emotionally for singlehood. Most readers, one suspects, will be slipped a copy by a worried mother or a soon-to-be ex-wife. Those who read it on their own are probably not those who need it.</p>
