        <p>Some in New Jersey see Gov James E McGreevey using his public, personal confession to draw attention from lapse in professional judgment that he fears will be exposed; note that what he left unsaid was that man his aides say he had affair with had been on state payroll; suggestion of patronage is not new in New Jersey politics; combustible blend of almost painfully personal revelations and familiar political realities may be why people around state could watch speech open-mouthed and than have very different reactions afterwards (M)</p>

        <p>It was an extraordinary spectacle, one that bosses with a sense of history ordered their young assistants to watch on the television set in the office, one that caused a stunned, lingering silence in hospital waiting rooms and diners and malls. A sitting governor, accompanied by his wife and parents, held a news conference in which he disclosed in a quick sequence that he was gay, had had an extramarital affair with another man and was resigning.</p>
        <p>But for all that was remarkable about Gov. James E. McGreevey's personal public confession, there was a more familiar element behind his demise, one he left unsaid: the man who his aides said had had an affair with him had been on the state payroll. That suggestion of patronage sounded somehow almost run-of-the-mill in the tawdry universe of New Jersey politics.</p>

        <p>It was an extraordinary spectacle, one that bosses with a sense of history ordered their young assistants to watch on the television set in the office, one that caused a stunned, lingering silence in hospital waiting rooms and diners and malls. A sitting governor, accompanied by his wife and parents, held a news conference in which he disclosed in a quick sequence that he was gay, had had an extramarital affair with another man and was resigning.</p>
        <p>But for all that was remarkable about Gov. James E. McGreevey's personal public confession, there was a more familiar element behind his demise, one he left unsaid: the man who his aides said had had an affair with him had been on the state payroll. That suggestion of patronage sounded somehow almost run-of-the-mill in the tawdry universe of New Jersey politics.</p>
        <p>This startling contrast, a combustible blend of almost painfully personal revelations and familiar political realities, was why people could watch the speech open-mouthed and then have such different reactions afterward.</p>
        <p>Some said it marked Mr. McGreevey as a risk taker with unusual personal courage. Some who are openly gay said they felt sympathy for a man struggling with wrenching internal issues. Some said it was a personal tragedy.</p>
        <p>But still others it was simply politics in 2004, that Mr. McGreevey was using this public, personal confession to draw attention from a lapse in professional judgment that he fears will be exposed.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone held their breath,'' said State Senator Diane B. Allen, a Republican who represents Burlington, N.J., after watching the speech on television. ''Boy, what a tough day it was.''</p>
        <p>Others marveled at the riveting theater of it all, saying Mr. McGreevey's short speech would join other watershed televised moments in political history.</p>
        <p>''What it reminds me of is Richard Nixon, the Checkers speech or some of the stuff during Watergate,'' said Steven Cohen, a professor at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.</p>
        <p>But he saw already the contrast in the words spoken by the governor and at least some of the reasons for the sudden announcement: ''The gender of the person he had the relationship with is irrelevant,'' he said. ''The problem is putting a lover on the payroll in some fashion.''</p>
        <p>Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who announced in 1987 that he was gay, said he watched Mr. McGreevey's speech with sadness and sympathy.</p>
        <p>''I came out at 47, too, though not under threat or anything,'' Mr. Frank said. ''There was a period in my life when I was clinically depressed, on drugs, seeing a psychiatrist -- I wasn't functional. You can be a dysfunctional member of Congress, but not a dysfunctional governor. In Congress, there are 434 other people. You can't put a governorship on autopilot.''</p>
        <p>As some wondered about the procedural questions raised by his speech -- the timing of his departure and the state's cumbersome succession rules for governors -- they were captivated by the emotion.</p>
        <p>''This resignation is a personal tragedy, so it complicates the let's-get-behind-the-new-person and make governance work,'' said Ingrid Reed, the director of the Eagleton New Jersey Project at Rutgers University. ''Now there is uncertainty.''</p>
        <p>The speech itself created a kind of uncertainty. From the way in which it was framed, many who heard it wondered whether Mr. McGreevey had resigned because he was gay or because of an affair.</p>
        <p>''I think he overreacted,'' said Howard Koeppel, the automobile dealer who, with his partner, Mark Hsiao, shared their Manhattan apartment with Rudolph W. Giuliani for six months in 2001.</p>
        <p>''Clinton didn't resign because he was having an affair outside his marriage. We are living in a different world than we were 25 years ago, and it wouldn't have affected McGreevey's chances of being re-elected if the people thought he had been a good governor.''</p>
        <p>He praised the governor for ''his honesty,'' adding: ''There are other public officials who are in his situation who aren't being as honest.''</p>
        <p>Perry N. Halkitis, the chairman of the applied psychology department at New York University, who has done research on gay identity, speculated that some would say Mr. McGreevey's announcement ''puts the gay movement back.''</p>
        <p>''I disagree with that, because how likely would it have been for Gov. McGreevey to have become governor if he had been an openly gay man?'' Mr. Halkitis said. ''We can count on our hands the number of openly gay government officials who hold high-level positions. It would have been unlikely for him to reach this point in his career if he was an openly gay man, and that's an unfortunate comment on our society.''</p>
        <p>But for many, the speech was about a moment.</p>
        <p>''My jaw dropped open,'' said Debbie Fierro, who owns the Rubyfruit Bar and Grill, a lesbian bar on Hudson Street in the West Village. ''I've heard and seen everything, but this was a shock to me.''</p>
        <p>Others were struck by his manner, his tone. ''You could see it in his face it was like, 'God, I'm free,''' said Joseph Reagan, a musician from Cranford, N.J., who was standing outside Helen's, a gay cabaret in Chelsea, after the speech. ''He looked relieved. I'm proud of him.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Reagan worried that Mr. McGreevey was sending the message that homosexuals cannot have high-level careers in politics or public service. Standing beside Mr. Reagan was Gaylin English, the manager of Helen's. She disagreed.</p>
        <p>''I don't think his resignation had anything to do with him being gay,'' she said. ''It was whether or not he was giving this guy perks.''</p>
        <p>Others were surprised by the sheer speed of Mr. McGreevey's downfall, that he was able to take the state and the national political establishment by surprise, that -- in an era when so much in politics is vetted and fine-tuned with polls -- there had been no leaks.</p>
        <p>''In a state with so much scandal and an administration that's had so much scandal, I think it's a comment on what really is driving a lot of our politics today, that it is this that has driven him out of office,'' Alan Brinkley, a historian who is the provost of Columbia University. ''Six months of scandal that would have brought down many governments had almost no impact on McGreevey, and now in a flicker he's gone.''</p>
