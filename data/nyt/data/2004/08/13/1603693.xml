        <p>With more than a third of the year gone by, New York State finally has a budget. But as details began to filter out Thursday, Gov. George E. Pataki warned that he would veto some of the Legislature's spending proposals.</p>
        <p>Hours after the State Legislature signed off Wednesday night on a $101.3 billion budget that is the most expensive -- and the tardiest -- in state history, the governor attacked the spending plan as a financially irresponsible document that ''spends too much and reforms too little.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, a Republican in his third term as governor, vowed to veto the parts of the budget that he disagreed with, once he and his staff have examined the tens of thousands of appropriations in 12 budget bills. He recalled how, in 1998, he moved similarly in striking 1,000 items that lawmakers had added to his original budget plan.</p>
        <p>''I have very profound concerns about how this budget affects the fiscal health of this state,'' Mr. Pataki said at a morning news conference in the State Capitol's ornate Red Room. ''We have real concerns that it creates a massive increase'' in projected future shortfalls. ''In the budget I proposed,'' he said, those shortfalls ''were manageable.''</p>
        <p>In response, New York's two top legislators, Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, and Sheldon Silver, Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, each portrayed the budget they passed as solid, warranting no vetoes. They neither promised nor ruled out overrides, at least for now.</p>
        <p>So, while it was still uncertain which parts of the budget would become law, the full breadth of the leaders' priorities became clear, but only after the votes.</p>
        <p>On top of a $99.8 billion budget that Mr. Pataki proposed in January, the lawmakers approved about $850 million more in spending that officials said was primarily supported by higher-than-anticipated state tax revenues. While the governor proposed $1.1 billion in new taxes and fees, the lawmakers enacted $700 million.</p>
        <p>The Legislature's plan relies in part on $459 million generated by an extension of the sales tax on clothing under $110; on nursing home owners paying $125 million more in higher assessments; and on gamblers generating $93 million in new revenue by playing more Quick Draw poker games in bars and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers also added new long-term debt to the budget. It added $600 million for construction and maintenance of state and city universities over the next five years, bringing that total to nearly $4 billion. It also enacted the governor's plan to raise more than $350 million through new borrowing for private and public colleges, officials said.</p>
        <p>To curb skyrocketing health care costs, the budget assumes from localities the cost of the state's Family Health Plus program, which provides health insurance for certain low-income families.</p>
        <p>And proving that a budget is more than figures in ledger book, the budget will have a tangible impact: those who like a glass of pinot noir with Sunday dinner may be happy to know that liquor stores will be able to stay open seven days a week, not six, in an effort to drive $2 million in additional tax revenue into state coffers. Part of the budget, though, seemed designed to get around the governor's veto threats. For instance, lawmakers passed $170 million in spending on their own pet projects, and $30 million for the governor's. But to discourage a veto, they linked the spending to money Mr. Pataki planned to use for economic development and job creation. Only half of the cash for pet projects is set to go out this year.</p>
        <p>The budget was enacted 133 days after the state's April 1 deadline, and was approved with little debate late Wednesday night. Budget watchdogs shook their heads.</p>
        <p>''New York State's handling of this year's budget is a landmark case of lousy government,'' said Diana Fortuna, the head of the Citizens Budget Commission. ''Its last-minute, late-night passage prevented legislators and the public from understanding what was being adopted.''</p>
        <p>Analysts quickly did the math, but in the opaque world of Albany budgeting, a debate ensued over who had the correct numbers; none of the top elected officials counted the money the same way. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno bickered over whose projection of actual spending last year was closer to the mark, an argument certain to shade a potential veto and override fight going forward.</p>
        <p>The lateness of the budget also had lawmakers wondering if the old sticks meant to prompt passage of a timely budget -- namely, withholding paychecks -- were an adequate incentive. Senator David A. Paterson, a Manhattan Democrat, said he got 11 checks worth about $20,000 on Thursday and cited it as proof that withholding salaries from lawmakers was not an effective way to stop gridlock. Rather, he said, budgets should be treated like round-the-clock labor negotiations.</p>
        <p>''If you want to hurt a politician you don't take their money, you take their time,'' he said. ''You keep legislators away from their constituents for two weeks and you will have inmates in an asylum and it's true.''</p>
