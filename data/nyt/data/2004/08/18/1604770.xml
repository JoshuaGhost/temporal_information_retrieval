      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Republican pollster Dick Wirthlin recalls helping devise Ronald Reagan's effective campaign in 1980, when he asked Americans if they were better off than they were four years earlier; says that if Pres Bush wishes to neutralize same question by John Kerry this year he must act before fall debates; suggests possible response that Bush could make in Republican national convention address</p>

        <p>Watching the presidential campaign unfold, I fear that something Ronald Reagan, David Gergen and I did 24 years ago may have armed Senator John Kerry with a potentially lethal rhetorical weapon. While helping Mr. Reagan prepare for his debate with President Jimmy Carter, we came up with what was probably the most devastating line Mr. Reagan used against Mr. Carter: ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?''</p>
        <p>Larry King put the question to President Bush last week, and some Democrats have been asking it as well. If Mr. Bush wants to neutralize this question, he must act before the debates this fall -- and this month's Republican National Convention provides him with the ideal opportunity.</p>

        <p>Ronald Reagan's famous question, "Are you better off than you were four years ago?", may come back to haunt President Bush.</p>

        <p>Watching the presidential campaign unfold, I fear that something Ronald Reagan, David Gergen and I did 24 years ago may have armed Senator John Kerry with a potentially lethal rhetorical weapon. While helping Mr. Reagan prepare for his debate with President Jimmy Carter, we came up with what was probably the most devastating line Mr. Reagan used against Mr. Carter: ''Are you better off than you were four years ago?''</p>
        <p>Larry King put the question to President Bush last week, and some Democrats have been asking it as well. If Mr. Bush wants to neutralize this question, he must act before the debates this fall -- and this month's Republican National Convention provides him with the ideal opportunity.</p>
        <p>Of course, the question is better suited to a challenger than an incumbent, and Mr. Reagan could ask it with reasonable confidence that most voters would answer no; it is doubtful whether that same certainty exists for President Bush. But if he follows a script similar to the one we used with Mr. Reagan, the president may be able to define the terms of the debate.</p>
        <p>In 1980, while working on Mr. Reagan's closing statement, I observed that one of Mr. Reagan's most impressive communicative tools was his use of rhetorical questions. I had seen him use the technique to great effect on the stump and was certain it could be used well during the debate. I also remembered that one of the most common survey questions pollsters pose is the so-called right direction/wrong track question: in your opinion, is the country headed in the right direction or is it on the wrong track?</p>
        <p>We then crafted a string of rhetorical questions -- the answers to which we knew would resoundingly favor our candidate -- devised to convince voters it was time for new leadership. Thus the birth of Mr. Reagan's famous question.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush must provide an answer to that question during his convention speech, so he can be sure Mr. Kerry will not quote Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail or, worse, during the presidential debates. Mr. Bush must inoculate himself in a venue widely viewed by voters and at the time of his own choosing.</p>
        <p>The good news for Republicans is that Mr. Bush has proved to be adept at snatching rhetorical arrows from his opponent's quiver. In 2000, for example, former Vice President Al Gore was fond of the phrase ''risky scheme''; in fact, he deemed just about every one of Mr. Bush's proposals a ''risky scheme.''</p>
        <p>Until, that is, Mr. Bush delivered his acceptance speech and said of his opponent: ''Every one of the proposals I've talked about tonight he's called a risky scheme over and over again. It is the sum of his message, the politics of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign. If my opponent had been at the moon launch, it would have been a risky rocket scheme. If he had been there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a risky anti-candle scheme. And if he had been there when the Internet was invented...''</p>
        <p>Not only did the line bring down the house, it effectively muzzled Mr. Gore by daring him to continue repeating the line -- something he did seldom thereafter.</p>
        <p>Likewise, President Bush must take ''Are you better off?'' out of play for Mr. Kerry. He can do this by laying out the list of reasons Americans are better off, particularly on issues of security in the broad sense. He must persuade voters that while America continues to gain traction during one of the most challenging times in our nation's history, those successes would be reversed were John Kerry to be elected.</p>
        <p>Most important, the president must focus on the future. He should convince Americans that the question is not so much whether we are better off than we were four years ago, but how, under his leadership, we will be even better off four years from now.</p>
