        <p>Representative Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, a respected Republican voice on intelligence issues who is retiring from Congress, is telling his constituents that he now considers the war in Iraq a mistake despite his earlier support for the invasion.</p>
        <p>In a four-page letter being distributed to constituents who call or write about the war, Mr. Bereuter said that initiating the pre-emptive military strike was not justified because of what he described as a massive intelligence failure.</p>
        <p>''I've reached the conclusion, retrospectively, now that the inadequate intelligence and faulty conclusions are being revealed, that all things being considered, it was a mistake to launch that military action, especially without a broad and engaged international coalition,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bereuter, who announced earlier this year that he was leaving Congress as of Aug. 31 after 26 years in the House, is the vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and had been at times mentioned as a potential chairman. He is also a senior member of the International Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Bereuter said that he could not disclose how many constituents had received copies of the letter, which was dated August 2004, and that the congressman was declining interviews about his change of heart. Mr. Bereuter's letter was first reported by The Journal Star, a newspaper in Lincoln, Neb.</p>
        <p>Republican leadership aides did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Bereuter's switch on an issue where most Republicans strongly back the president. But on CNN, Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican who previously served on the House panel with Mr. Bereuter, said, ''Doug has the right to his opinion, and that is what makes our country so great.''</p>
