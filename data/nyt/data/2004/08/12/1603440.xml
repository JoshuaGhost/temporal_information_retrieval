        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''$220 for Two Hours? Clocking Mr. Fix-It'' (Online Shopper, Aug. 5) reflects little or no understanding of the work that home maintenance requires, and unreasonable expectations of the services necessary to perform it. Your writer is pleased with the results of Mr. Handyman's service but feels ripped off by the extra 15 minutes she was billed when the billing seems consistent with everything she was told and agreed to before the work was started.</p>
