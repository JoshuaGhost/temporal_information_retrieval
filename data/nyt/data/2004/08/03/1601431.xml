        <p>Justin Gatlin, fresh from making the United States Olympic team in the 100 meters, was modeling his uniform with other members of the United States track and field team at the Olympic trials in Sacramento last month. His mother, Jeanette, was walking around the back of the room taking photos and flashing the thumbs-up sign, gold pendants with figures of a little boy and a sprinter swaying on her neck.</p>
        <p>As Gatlin talked about wanting to become one of the greats, he smiled at his mother and his father, Willie, who was standing against a wall. Gatlin said later that he was not embarrassed by his mother's proud display.</p>
        <p>''They've done so much for me,'' the 22-year-old Gatlin said of his parents after he had made the Olympic team in a second event, the 200 meters. ''They always wake me up. I'm like, 'I just want to make the Olympic team.' They're like, 'You want to do more than that, you want to go out and win a medal.' They always keep me in focus.''</p>
        <p>For 10 or 20 seconds on the track, Gatlin's focus can be singular. But sometimes his concentration has been known to wane.</p>
        <p>''During preseason, he's laid back, he accepts anything,'' his coach, Trevor Graham, said. ''But when it comes to big meets, he's like Michael Jordan. He shows up; he's the real deal.''</p>
        <p>When Gatlin stepped to the starting line for the 100-meter final July 11 in Sacramento, tears welled in his eyes. Still, he managed to channel his emotions. He leaned forward three meters too soon, but he crossed the finish line second, in 9.92 seconds -- one-hundredth of a second behind Maurice Greene, the defending Olympic champion, and one-hundredth of a second in front of Shawn Crawford, who is Gatlin's training partner.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Gatlin burst into tears. ''My dream had come true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the final of the 200 meters seven days later, he finished second to Crawford, two-hundredths of a second behind, in 20.01. ''I like training like I'm second anyway, because it's something to strive for,'' Gatlin said. ''If you're first, you're happy with your success that you have, but it's harder to stay focused.''</p>
        <p>Staying focused has been the challenge of his life. When he was in fourth grade, he turned in a piece of paper for a spelling test that had on it only a drawing of a bird he had spotted outside. His mother had him tested for attention deficit disorder. For 10 years, Gatlin said, he took different medications before settling on Adderall.</p>
        <p>He continued taking the medication until he was a freshman at the University of Tennessee. He said that neither he nor his coach knew that he was supposed to register for a medical exemption with the United States Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
        <p>Adderall is a stimulant, which is prohibited in Olympic sports and by many professional leagues. In May 2002, it was revealed that Gatlin tested positive for amphetamine at the 2001 junior nationals and he was suspended for two years; he was stripped of the three titles he won at the junior nationals. In July of that year, the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body, reduced his penalty to one year, noting that his positive test was a result of his medical condition.</p>
        <p>The I.A.A.F. warned, however, that another positive test could result in a lifetime ban.</p>
        <p>''You got to understand that hey, you're responsible with whatever's going into your body,'' Gatlin said. ''I always thought I was the good guy. I didn't know it was something banned. But I took it.''</p>
        <p>Gatlin, who was still able to compete in collegiate events because his medication was not on the N.C.A.A.'s banned list, then became the first athlete since 1957 to win back-to-back outdoor titles in the 100 and 200 sprints at the N.C.A.A. championships. After his sophomore year, Gatlin decided to turn professional.</p>
        <p>He and his parents chose Graham's Sprint Capitol camp in Raleigh, N.C. Sprint Capitol has since come under suspicion because six athletes coached by Graham have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in recent years. Another four of Graham's current or former athletes have been implicated in the Balco scandal and have been accused of using banned substances; their cases are pending. Graham has said he never provided athletes with performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>Gatlin said he chose to work with Graham because, at the time, he was coaching Marion Jones, the Olympic sprint champion, and Tim Montgomery, the world-record holder in the 100 meters. ''At that time, I didn't know anything about steroids and creams,'' Gatlin said. Jones and Montgomery had an acrimonious split with Graham in late 2002.</p>
        <p>Gatlin staunchly defends Graham. ''I've been in the camp and I can honestly say that he only coaches us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gatlin began his professional career by beating Greene and placing second in the 60 meters at the Millrose Games in 2003. He then won the United States and world indoor titles in the 60 dash that season, but that spring, Gatlin injured his right hamstring at a meet in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>The injury did not heal in time for the United States outdoor championships, and he failed to advance out of his first heat of the 100.</p>
        <p>In September, Gatlin came back to win the 100 at the Moscow Challenge, an event that carried a $500,000 purse, which he said earned him the nickname ''Half-million-dollar Kid'' with his peers.</p>
        <p>One problem, he said, is that he has never been paid. Jeanette Gatlin said that in February, the meet organizers paid $100,000 to Gatlin's former agent, Charley Wells. Wells was entitled to 15 percent, Gatlin said, but he has yet to receive his $85,000 share. ''I believe in karma, and it comes back to you,'' Gatlin said of Wells. ''He can have that money. It's a lot of money, but I'm not in need.''</p>
        <p>Wells did not respond to several requests for comment.</p>
        <p>Gatlin has bought a new house for his parents in Pensacola, Fla., and a car for his mother. He has, apparently, fulfilled the commandments embodied by the tattoos on his forearms, which, he said, say Honor thy Mother and Honor Thy Father, in Japanese.</p>
        <p>Jeanette Gatlin said she should have seen his Olympic ambitions years ago, when Justin hurdled fire hydrants on the way to kindergarten. The family was living in Brooklyn then. Willie Gatlin trained reservists at a nearby army base before retiring to Pensacola when Justin was 9. Gatlin began hurdling and sprinting in junior high school, to his parents' surprise.</p>
        <p>''I was always lazy and slow around the house,'' Gatlin said. ''When they went to watch me run, they were surprised with how intense I was and how much passion I had to be fast.''</p>
        <p>Gatlin is joined in his pursuit by Crawford, 26, who joined Graham's training group last year. ''Shawn is like Justin's big brother,'' Graham said. ''He's calm, cool, collected, and he teaches him off the track, too.''</p>
        <p>Gatlin knows he still has much to learn. In June, he said, when he went to the starting line for the 100 at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., his mind was cluttered and he lost, badly.</p>
        <p>Since that meet, Gatlin has worked hard to improve his concentration. Before the Olympic trials, he said, ''I was on a mission; I promised Coach that I would be a different person.''</p>
        <p>Graham said many people had underestimated Gatlin. ''People thought when he got here he was more of a 400, 200 runner,'' he said. ''Justin has worked so hard in the sprints to prove everyone wrong. I just honestly feel like he can be the world-record holder.''</p>
        <p>Gatlin said he did not need a world record. ''I'm not racing for the record, I'm just racing to be dominant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He had the phrase ''Live to fight, fight to live,'' etched on his back two months ago. ''I felt I was losing my edge, becoming content,'' Gatlin said.</p>
        <p>He is focused again.</p>
