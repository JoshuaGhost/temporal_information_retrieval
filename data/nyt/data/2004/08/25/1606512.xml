        <p>The biggest takeover battle in Japanese history became even bigger on Tuesday as the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group sought to disrupt a rival's expansion plans with a $29 billion hostile bid for UFJ Holdings.</p>
        <p>Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan's third-largest bank, offered to exchange one share of its stock for each share of UFJ, a bid that values UFJ at about 3.2 trillion yen, or $29.14 billion, a 23 percent premium over UFJ's share price on Tuesday. The deal, if completed, would form the world's largest bank by assets, surpassing Citigroup.</p>
        <p>The offer was an escalation in the battle for UFJ, the smallest and weakest of Japan's top four banks. UFJ said on Aug. 12 that it had reached a basic agreement to be taken over in October by its preferred bidder, the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Japan's second-largest bank.</p>
        <p>But Jason Rogers, a bank credit analyst at Barclays Capital in Tokyo, said, ''UFJ can't ignore this bid.''</p>
        <p>''Mitsubishi Tokyo may have to sweeten the deal,'' Mr. Rogers said. Others agreed that the move increased the pressure on Mitsubishi Tokyo to come up with a better offer.</p>
        <p>A Mitsubishi Tokyo spokesman said that the bank would continue to examine UFJ to determine a valuation and that Sumitomo Mitsui's bid would not affect that process. ''There's been no change at all,'' he said.</p>
        <p>UFJ said in a statement that it would examine the offer from Sumitomo Mitsui, although there was no change to its plan to combine with Mitsubishi Tokyo.</p>
        <p>The bank that takes over UFJ will emerge as the world's largest lender, as measured by assets, and the leader in Japanese finance, just as the outlook for the sector is improving with the country's most vibrant recovery in a decade.</p>
        <p>UFJ and Mitsubishi Tokyo have already proposed a name for a combined bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Holdings, and outlined a leadership structure. But they have so far left out the crucial detail of how much Mitsubishi Tokyo would pay for UFJ.</p>
        <p>By making a concrete bid, Sumitomo Mitsui is putting pressure on UFJ to consider its offer seriously, analysts said. In the last few months, UFJ has repeatedly rebuffed proposals by Sumitomo Mitsui to begin takeover talks.</p>
        <p>The messy and public bidding war for UFJ is unusual in Japan's chummy banking world, where mergers have usually been quietly negotiated, often under the guidance of government regulators.</p>
        <p>UFJ announced it was entering merger talks with Mitsubishi Tokyo last month, but the talks were soon hung up by a legal challenge from Sumitomo Trust and Banking, a company with ties to Sumitomo Mitsui. Sumitomo Trust won a court injunction preventing UFJ from including its profitable money-management unit in the talks with Mitsubishi Tokyo; UFJ had previously agreed to sell the unit to Sumitomo Trust.</p>
        <p>The injunction was lifted this month by a higher court, clearing the way for the basic takeover agreement between UFJ and Mitsubishi Tokyo.</p>
        <p>A merger of UFJ and Mitsubishi Tokyo would create a bank with assets of 189 trillion yen, or $1.7 trillion. By that measure, it would be bigger than the No.1 Japanese bank, the Mizuho Financial Group, and larger than Citigroup, which has assets of $1.3 trillion. A combined Sumitomo and UFJ, with 180 trillion yen ($1.64 trillion) in assets, would also rank as the world's biggest bank.</p>
        <p>A decade-long struggle with bad loans has forced the Osaka-based UFJ to find a partner. The bank has suffered losses for three years because of high levels of nonperforming loans and has fallen behind on a government-mandated schedule to clean up its loan portfolio. Sumitomo Mitsui also offered on Tuesday to inject as much as 700 billion yen into UFJ to help it write off 4.62 trillion yen in bad loans, matching a similar offer from Mitsubishi Tokyo. Analysts say Mitsubishi Tokyo would be the better choice for UFJ because it is widely considered to be Japan's strongest bank.</p>
        <p>Japan's finance industry has experienced huge changes in recent years as a string of mergers has combined more than a dozen major financial institutions into four huge banks -- Mizuho, Mitsubishi Tokyo, Sumitomo Mitsui and UFJ.</p>
        <p>The mergers came in the aftermath of the collapse of the bubble in real estate and stock prices in the early 1990's and a decade of feeble economic growth that crippled many of Japan's big banks.</p>
        <p>UFJ shares, which have climbed 14 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since Sumitomo Mitsui first made its hostile offer to merge with UFJ on July 30, rose 15,000 yen, or 3 percent, to 510,000 yen before Sumitomo Mitsui's announcement Tuesday.</p>
