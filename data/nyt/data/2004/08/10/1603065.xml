        <p>An armed man walked into a Jennifer Convertibles store in Bay Ridge yesterday, forced a woman who was in the store into a back area, sexually assaulted her and fled, the police said. Investigators said the woman, whose identity was not disclosed, was taken to a nearby hospital. They said the attack occurred about 1 p.m. after the man entered the store, on 4th Avenue between 85th and 86th Streets, and displayed a handgun. There were no arrests as of last night, and it was unclear whether the man had taken any cash or merchandise, the police said.</p>
