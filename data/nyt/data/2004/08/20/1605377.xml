        <p>NGO--Dr. Ignacia U., 64, passed away on August 18, 2004 four days after a massive stroke. She was an extraordinary, vivacious, and beautiful person, beloved and respected by her relatives, friends, colleagues, and patients. ''Iggy'' grew up in Manila and Xiamen, attended the University of the East, and trained as an anesthesiologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. She was an attending anesthesiologist at Roosevelt Hospital for 28 years, earning the respect, confidence, and admiration of all of her colleagues. She was the center and supporter of her very extensive family, caring for her brothers and sisters, her many nieces and nephews, and her parents. Her sense of obligation to them was the guiding spirit of her life. She enjoyed art, music, drama, travel, food, cooking, and meeting with her many friends. She is survived by her parents, Edward and Siong Ngo, ten siblings and their spouses, many nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, and her companion, Oscar B. Garfein, MD. The world is both less beautiful and good for her passing. Funeral services will be held in San Francisco. A memorial service will be held in October. Her friends and colleagues are invited to the home she shared with Dr. Garfein on August 23rd and 24th, 6-9 PM. Memorial contributions may be made to the Department of Anesthesiology, St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center, 1000 10th Ave., New York, NY 10019.</p>
        <p>NGO--Ignacia, M.D. The Association of the Alumni of the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, Columbia University, would like to acknowledge the death of Dr. Ignacia Ngo and extend heartfelt condolences to her husband, Dr. Oscar Garfein, former president of the Association of the Alumni.
