        <p>How to dress an elephant? The world's top designers took on the question for W magazine's special fashion shoot, which appears this month.</p>

        <p>The most enduring image of fashion and pachyderms is Richard Avedon's portrait ''Dovima With Elephants,'' taken in August 1955 in Paris and published in Harper's Bazaar. Dovima was in her couture silks, the elephants in their natural wrinkles, and the poses were manifestly gorgeous, as the decade was.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, no fashion photographer since has been tempted by the innocence of elephants. But in August, nearly half a century after the Avedon session, Bruce Weber telephoned Dennis Freedman, the creative director of W magazine.</p>
        <p>He said, ''Dennis, are you sitting down?''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Weber proposed was a fashion shoot with elephants dressed by the world's top designers. Maybe it was the excitement in Mr. Weber's voice, maybe it was their mutual love of animals, but, whatever the reason Mr. Freedman didn't say, ''Have you lost your mind?'' Instead, he said: ''How fabulous. All those large-size clothes.''</p>
        <p>''Large-size'' doesn't exactly cover the 90 yards of tweed that Karl Lagerfeld used to make a pair of Chanel suits. Nor does it suggest the potential for hallucination in the Chanel ateliers as seamstresses worked on the spring 2005 collection, which starred Nicole Kidman. ''Immediately, Karl wanted to do the elephant clothes,'' said Virginie Viard, the director of the Chanel studio.</p>
        <p>But the pictures, which will appear in W this month, don't give a true sense of scale. The hats that Chanel made were shipped in crates that stood five feet high. And, as Mr. Freedman said: ''We thought we were only getting a hat. Then we opened the boxes and found a pair of gigantic Chanel earrings and two elephant tweed suits.''</p>
        <p>A dozen designers made outfits, including Helmut Lang, Nicolas Ghesquiere and Marc Jacobs. Manolo Blahnik designed lace-up shoes; stilettos were out of the question. ''I loved the idea,'' said Mr. Blahnik, who as a child made shoes for lizards from tinfoil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghesquiere said he set to work soon after receiving a note in September from Mr. Weber. ''It was three weeks before our show,'' he said. ''We just gave up working on the collection for three hours every day. It was so relaxing to think about the elephants, which are iconic.''</p>
        <p>Using measurements provided by the elephants' owners -- Gary and Kari Johnson, who keep seven elephants at their place near San Diego and run a business called Have Trunk Will Travel -- Mr. Ghesquiere designed a metallic cloak with garlands of tiny chains. ''I thought she has to be in the fashion moment,'' he said, referring to one of Mr. Weber's models. ''I wanted to give the elephants brightness and lightness -- even a reflection of the sky.''</p>
        <p>The clothes reveal the aesthetic of each designer. Dolce &amp; Gabbana sent a hot-pink corset; Mr. Lang proposed a minimalist tank top.</p>
        <p>But how to dress an elephant? ''It took about nine people,'' Mr. Weber said.</p>
        <p>''And two ladders,'' Mr. Freedman added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber has been hanging out with the elephants for awhile. ''He's just fascinated by their personalities,'' Ms. Johnson said. (The income the animals earn from appearing in movies goes to support the Johnsons' various causes, including health research and breeding programs.)</p>
        <p>''The wonderful thing about elephants is they love to work, so it wasn't like we were forcing them to wear clothes,'' Mr. Weber said. He noted that Rosie, one model, was quite shy about wearing the corset, and that another, Tai, seemed worried about tearing the hem of her Vuitton dress.</p>
        <p>''So they're kind of better behaved than most models,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a way, what the pictures illustrate is that creativity doesn't have to be lurid to be cutting edge. It can also be, Mr. Freedman said, about the childlike imagination.</p>
