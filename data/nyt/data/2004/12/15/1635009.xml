        <p>Human skeletal remains were found by a worker cleaning a remote corner of a highway overpass in Brooklyn yesterday, the police said. The remains were in a seated position in a wooded area against the wall of the Highland Boulevard overpass crossing the Jackie Robinson Parkway, where homeless people sometimes sleep. The medical examiner's office will examine the remains today, a spokeswoman said. An investigator said that there was no obvious sign of foul play.</p>
