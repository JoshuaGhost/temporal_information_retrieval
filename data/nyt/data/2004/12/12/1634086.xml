      <abstract>
        <p>Kate Jacobs article, in review of year's notable ideas and developments, on trend by teachers toward using kinder, gentler hue of purple to grade students' tests and papers; red has been found to be intimidating, although experts are split on impact of change; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The latest menace to the American education system has nothing to do with standardized tests or McDonald's outposts in school lunchrooms. Instead, it's a venerable symbol of discipline and authority: the red ink that has been used to grade papers for generations. For the school year that ended in the spring, focus groups and in-store polls conducted by Paper Mate revealed that teachers were migrating away from red ink and toward the kinder, gentler hue of purple.</p>
        <p>Proponents of purple contend that grading with violet tones is less negative than using angry reds. Sensing a marketing opportunity,</p>
        <p>Paper Mate increased production of purple pens by 10 percent; Staples and OfficeMax followed suit, stocking more purple-ink products and offering boxes of purple-only pens. Leatrice Eiseman, director of the Pantone Color Institute, calls purple the ideal color for grading. ''Red is rather intimidating,'' she says. ''With the purple, you soften the blow.'' Jan Haag, another advocate of purple pens, says that the comment she hears most often from her students at Sacramento City College is simply ''Thank you for not using red.''</p>
        <p>But even advocates of the switch acknowledge that purple is not intrinsically better. Eiseman gives purple a few years before new cultural associations force the teaching establishment to come up with an even newer, even friendlier grading color.</p>
