      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The classical recording business still has its problems, and it is anyone's guess how the Sony-BMG merger will affect the industry, but obituaries are still premature. Perhaps more labels are beginning to find virtue in the necessity to live small. For whatever reason, the number of truly excellent CD's seems to have risen over the last year or two. So it is with pleasure that the classical music critics of The NewYork Times here list some of their favorite CD's from 2004.</p>
        <p>Hilliard Ensemble (ECM New Series) This 14th-century poet and composer wrote music whose spare and haunting beauty can at first seem disorienting to modern ears. These motets, in a sumptuous performance by the Hilliard Ensemble, make a wonderful introduction, with their undulating polyphony, shivery dissonances and supple vocal lines, each built around its own poetic text.</p>
