        <p>To enliven the life of the mouth, 'tis the season for gifts of books about language. ('Tis, a contraction of it is, takes an apostrophe; till, which is an older word than until and not its shortening, does not.) A few suggestions:</p>
        <p>The Dictionary of Disagreeable English, by Robert Hartwell Fiske (Writer's Digest Books, $13 paperback): He styles himself ''the grumbling grammarian,'' offering ''a curmudgeon's compendium of excruciatingly correct grammar.'' This pose is often struck by many of us in the language dodge; our audience is composed of (not comprised of) people who get a delicious kick out of getting incensed at loosey-goosey usage. (We stole the mock-severe approach from Judith Martin, successor to Emily Post, who began her series of etiquette books in 1982 with ''Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior.'')</p>

        <p>To enliven the life of the mouth, 'tis the season for gifts of books about language. ('Tis, a contraction of it is, takes an apostrophe; till, which is an older word than until and not its shortening, does not.) A few suggestions:</p>
        <p>The Dictionary of Disagreeable English, by Robert Hartwell Fiske (Writer's Digest Books, $13 paperback): He styles himself ''the grumbling grammarian,'' offering ''a curmudgeon's compendium of excruciatingly correct grammar.'' This pose is often struck by many of us in the language dodge; our audience is composed of (not comprised of) people who get a delicious kick out of getting incensed at loosey-goosey usage. (We stole the mock-severe approach from Judith Martin, successor to Emily Post, who began her series of etiquette books in 1982 with ''Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior.'')</p>
        <p>Fiske grumbles that healthy is ''misused for healthful. . . . The difference in these two meanings is worth observing. Let us use healthy to mean enjoying good health, and healthful to mean contributing to or promoting good health.''</p>
        <p>Same with peaceful/peaceable. Fiske notes that ''peaceful means tranquil; undisturbed by strife or turbulence,'' while ''peaceable means inclined to peace.'' Thus, Iraqis ''are a peaceful people'' is a mistake; they are peaceable, at least those who are not bellicose.</p>
        <p>The Lie That Tells a Truth (W.W. Norton, $15 paperback. I refuse to go along with the ''$14.95'' marketing manipulation in any of the prices herein. How's that for being an excruciating curmudgeon?): This is a useful and literate guide to writing fiction by the novelist John Dufresne. (The most helpful short handbook for getting started writing is Herbert and Jill Meyer's 1993 How to Write, $7, www.stormkingpress.com.)</p>
        <p>The last chapter of Dufresne's guide touches on common errors. Example: ''Never use try and (everyone does, of course) instead of try to. (A character may say it, but not the narrator.)'' (That reminds me -- easy on the parentheses.) ''What goes for try and goes for be sure and.''</p>
        <p>Dufresne studs his book with a sparkling array of relevant and unfamiliar quotations. A chapter on ''plottery'' leads off with this advice from the playwright Jean Anouilh: ''Life is very nice, but it lacks form. It's the aim of art to give it some.'' A passage on motivation of character is enlivened with Mel Brooks's ''Listen to your broccoli, and your broccoli will tell you how to eat it.'' There is a tough assignment about openings from John Irving: ''Whenever possible tell the whole story of the novel in the first sentence.''</p>
        <p>That brings us to the sixth edition of The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations ($50), edited by Elizabeth Knowles, with plenty of fresh remarks that may turn out to be memorable:</p>
        <p>Tom Brokaw, on premature calls of an Al Gore victory in 2000: ''We don't just have egg on our face. We have omelette all over our suits.'' (Oxford uses the British spelling of omelet.) And this related self-deprecating remark from the defeated candidate: ''I am Al Gore, and I used to be the next president of the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan's ''irrational exuberance'' made it, as well as Donald Rumsfeld's dismissal of French and German criticism as coming from ''Old Europe'' and George W. Bush's ''axis of evil.'' Ariel Sharon is recorded saying, ''I'm not going to make any compromise whatsoever'' rather than his subsequent ''We are prepared to make painful compromises for the sake of real peace.''</p>
        <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger came on the scene too late for his adoption of ''girlie men'' to be included, but Knowles added the Persian monarch Xerxes on the exploits of Artemisia at Salamis in 480 B.C.: ''My men have turned into women and my women into men.'' (The warrior queen was later cruel to a boyfriend and was punished by the gods by being forced to take the ''lover's leap'' off the Leucadian promontory. Following up on quotations is a scholarly delight; just listen to your broccoli.)</p>
        <p>My broccoli asks, What's with the addition of a quotation from Judah Benjamin, Louisiana senator and later Confederate secretary of state? In B. Perley Poore's 1886 ''Perley's Reminiscences,'' Benjamin, a Jew, was quoted as replying to a bigoted taunt by a senator of German descent, ''The gentleman will please remember that when his half-civilized ancestors were hunting the wild boar in Silesia, mine were princes of the earth.''</p>
        <p>I immediately looked under Disraeli for a quite similar quotation; not there. (I'm not knocking the publisher of great reference works; its Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus, $40, compiled by Christine Lindberg, is the best new array of synonyms around.) In Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, however, here is what Benjamin Disraeli, then British M.P. and later prime minister, said in reply to a similar taunt from the Irish reformer Daniel O'Connell: ''Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon.''</p>
        <p>Bartlett's has a footnote to its undated Disraeli quotation calling attention to the Benjamin quotation, also undated. So the question is, Who was the first to use that memorable formulation? Disraeli seems to have said it in the 1830's, when both he and O'Connell were in the House of Commons; Benjamin served in the United States Senate from 1853 to 1861, if that is where he said it.</p>
        <p>If Disraeli said it first, did a report about his retort appear in a U.S. newspaper, possibly seen by Benjamin? Or was it a case of great minds thinking alike? Knowles says that it may be ''a generic answer, modified by personal circumstance, rather than a single individual's coinage,'' pointing to the 1993 response by the South African politician Helen Suzman under similar attack: ''My ancestors were busy writing the Bible.''</p>
        <p>The phrasedick division of the Lexicographic Irregulars is asked to take a crack at this possible trans-Atlantic telepathy. Send your citations or theories to onlanguage@nytimes.com. Although I will be retiring my Op-Ed column in The Times toward the end of next month, I will soldier on as language maven in this magazine. Your contributions and emendations, as well as the Gotcha! Gang's corrections, are invited as before. We happy few (maybe not so few) are all in this together.</p>
