        <p>France's highest administrative court delays decision on banning Al Manar Arabic-language channel, run by Hezbollah, from Lebanon; government asserts that Al Manar's broadcasts are anti-Semitic and racist and support violence, but effort to shut it down has been thwarted by legal loopholes; French broadcasting regulator last month renewed license for Al Manar to operate in France as long as it abides by law; government contends it broke law four days later with inflammatory story; Al Manar is available by satellite in United States, where there are no plans to close it down, although Hezbollah has been on State Dept list of terrorist organization since 1997 (M)</p>

        <p>France's highest administrative court has put off until Monday a decision on whether to ban Al Manar, the popular Arab-language channel run by the Hezbollah militia out of Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The two-day delay by the court, the Council of State, reflects the delicate nature of the impending ruling after a yearlong campaign by the French government to shut down Al Manar because of its anti-Semitic and racist reports and support of violence.</p>
        <p>Judge Bruno Genevois, head of the Council of State's dispute bureau, did not give an explanation for the delay but indicated that the deliberations would not be ''a debate on the political situation in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>But the government's campaign has been thwarted by loopholes in French law.</p>
        <p>Last month, much to the chagrin of the French government, France's public broadcasting regulating agency granted Al Manar a license to continue its operations in France as long as it abides by French law.</p>
        <p>The agency, known as the Audio-Visual Higher Council, functions like the Federal Communications Commission in the United States.</p>
        <p>But four days later, the channel, which regularly transmits anti-Semitic, anti-American and anti-Israeli broadcasts, broke its agreement, French officials said. It broadcast a report claiming that Israel for years had spread H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and other diseases throughout the Arab world. A second report called for war against Jews and the destruction of Israel.</p>
        <p>Al Manar is available in dozens of countries around the world through a network of international satellite providers. It is broadcast in Europe via Eutelsat, based in Paris, as part of a package of nine channels put out by Arabsat, based in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>It is even available in the United States, despite the fact that Hezbollah has been listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization since 1997.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has taken no action to shut down the broadcasts in the United States.</p>
        <p>Asked on Thursday whether the Bush administration was considering taking action against Al Manar, Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman, said, ''I'm not aware of deliberations on that subject.'' He referred reporters to the Federal Communications Commission ''to ask whether they're looking into it.''</p>
        <p>An F.C.C. official said the commission had no authority to act against a satellite television channel.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, the American Jewish Committee, based in New York, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow asking that Al Manar be shut down in the United States under existing counterterrorism laws and executive orders.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the Lebanese government threatened to retaliate against French media outlets if Al Manar was banned in France.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the Arab League, Lebanon asked for a review of the privileges granted to some French media outlets throughout the Arab world ''that carry anti-Arab, racist material that incites hate.''</p>
