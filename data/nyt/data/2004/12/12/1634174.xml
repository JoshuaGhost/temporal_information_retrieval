        <p>THE controversy over New York City's plan to expand restrictions on cars in Central Park has a distinctive sound. It's not the roar of traffic, but a fading echo of a similar dispute more than a century ago. In the early 1890's, a group of privileged sportsmen proposed a track for harness racing and fast carriages on the west side of the park. Known as ''Rotten Row,'' the Tammany-backed project was defeated -- but less than a decade later the internal combustion engine arrived.</p>
        <p>Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux had two key elements in mind when they designed Central Park in the 1850's. Unlike the large, formal parks of Europe, their own effort would be an unfolding vista, to be enjoyed as much while moving as while standing still. They also eschewed reserving parts of the park for exclusive uses, like ball games and playgrounds.</p>

        <p>THE controversy over New York City's plan to expand restrictions on cars in Central Park has a distinctive sound. It's not the roar of traffic, but a fading echo of a similar dispute more than a century ago. In the early 1890's, a group of privileged sportsmen proposed a track for harness racing and fast carriages on the west side of the park. Known as ''Rotten Row,'' the Tammany-backed project was defeated -- but less than a decade later the internal combustion engine arrived.</p>
        <p>Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux had two key elements in mind when they designed Central Park in the 1850's. Unlike the large, formal parks of Europe, their own effort would be an unfolding vista, to be enjoyed as much while moving as while standing still. They also eschewed reserving parts of the park for exclusive uses, like ball games and playgrounds.</p>
        <p>In service to their first goal, they designed a six-mile carriage loop, from 59th to 110th Street and back, with the sentiment that it would be used for pleasure driving around the park, not as a safety valve for local traffic. The graveled, undulating loop road attracted a parade of carriages and other vehicles, and most of this procession happily proceeded at a stately pace -- indeed, the custom of being seen was as important as seeing the park.</p>
        <p>But by the 1880's, an attempt was initiated to ''improve'' the park by adding a fast-driving track -- apparently more for small harness rigs than for saddle horses. It soon developed into what was envisioned as a 100-foot-wide path on the wildly varying ground just inside the park's western wall, next to what is now Central Park West. At the time the speed limit in the park was six miles per hour. The faster rigs could easily triple that speed if they had a special course.</p>
        <p>In February 1892, things came to a head when Tammany's boss, State Senator George Washington Plunkitt, introduced legislation in Albany to build a 70-foot-wide path along the western wall. (Senator Plunkitt was the politician who coined the term ''honest graft,'' saying he had no moral qualms about using inside information on pending legislation to buy up land near public improvements to make money when the projects were announced.)</p>
        <p>Gov. Roswell Flower signed the bill into law just 10 minutes after its passage in the Assembly. By this time, the driving-track proposal had earned the unattractive sobriquet Rotten Row. In the public mind this matched the association of racetrack operations with petty gamblers and toughs, but the derivation is from ''route du roi,'' the French for royal way, referring to the path in London's Hyde Park where the upper class drove their carriages.</p>
        <p>There was much outrage against this planned invasion of Central Park. The New York Times said: ''The rowdy element will go there as a needle will go to a magnet. Young hoodlums and toughs who have nothing to do elsewhere will make the vicinity of the racetrack a regular loafing place.''</p>
        <p>One of the city's park commissioners, Nathan Straus, a well-known horseman, supported the project because, he said, the regular park drive was crowded with a variety of vehicles. But The Times reported that the entire West Side was ''a perfect hotbed of indignation.''</p>
        <p>The city still had to put the plan into effect, and hundreds came to protest at a public hearing in March. Joseph Delavergne, a well-known horseman, painted the race track in a democratic light, saying, according to The Times, that ''the common people of the city, the single-horse owners, demand this road.'' His comment drew some laughter from the packed house, since the best guess was that the track would serve only 200 or 300 people, all of whom had to be rich enough to own, stable and care for horses and vehicles.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Straus defended Rotten Row, maintaining that the western edge of the park ''is all big nasty rocks and gullies.'' But the commissioners finally voted against the project. A mass meeting at Cooper Union seeking repeal of the state authorization resulted in ''A Thunderous 'Hands Off the Park,''' according to the headline in The New York Tribune.</p>
        <p>The issue mobilized all classes. The leading families of New York -- the Fishes, Sloanes, Vanderbilts, Seligmans and Schiffs, among scores of others -- and working-class organizations like the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners and the United Clothing Cutters all opposed the plan.</p>
        <p>In April, another park commissioner, Paul Dana -- who apparently had opposed the measure -- wrote to the State Assembly asking for repeal, saying that soon baseball players would ask for permanent ball fields and tennis players would ask for dedicated courts, which were contrary to the original ideals of the park. (Ball fields and tennis courts have become, of course, permanent parts of today's park.)</p>
        <p>Dana also took issue with the pro-Rotten Row description of the rocky, picturesque site for the track, and the letter he wrote to The Times wrestles with issues that still dominate park controversies: ''It has been said in support of the new road that it would be laid out in an 'unused' portion. There is no unused portion of Central Park. Take, for example, one of its green fields. That is fulfilling its very highest use when no foot ever treads upon it. One might as well say that the space occupied by a flower bed is unused because it is untouched.''</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether the Rotten Row legislation was repealed, but the following year the fast-driving fraternity got what it wanted, only farther uptown -- a race course along Manhattan's Harlem River shore from 155th to Dyckman Street, later converted to the Harlem River Drive.</p>
        <p>The age of the horse was ending, and in 1899, after a court fight, automobiles were admitted to Central Park. Soon the idea of taking a pleasure drive through the park was ancient history, especially with the speed limit set at 25 miles per hour, making the park drives as exclusive of other uses as Plunkitt would have had them.</p>
        <p>The six-mile loop from 59th to 110th was made one-way, counterclockwise, in 1929.</p>
        <p>There were experiments in the 1960's with eliminating cars from Central Park, and car usage has gradually been cut back. The Parks Department has announced that beginning in January, automobile access to the park drive will be limited to 7 to 10 a.m. and 3 to 7 p.m. on weekdays. (The new rules do not affect the transverses at 65th, 79th, 85th and 97th Streets.)</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most significant change will be the complete closing of the East 90th, East 102nd, West 77th and West 90th Street entrances, which will dramatically reduce the value of the drive as a shortcut from Midtown.</p>
        <p>Taxi drivers and taxi owners' associations have complained that the new regulations will prevent them from taking a much-used shortcut when Fifth Avenue or Central Park West are clogged with traffic. But some groups want cars to be banned completely.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if the speed limit were returned to six miles per hour, the drive might return to Olmsted and Vaux's original ideal.</p>
