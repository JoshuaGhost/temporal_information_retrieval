        <p>Afghan Opium Production An Issue in U.S. Report  Poppy cultivation and opium production will continue to increase in Afghanistan, expanding the dangerous influence of drug lords on the government, a new confidential American military assessment warns. Overall, though, it contained a largely upbeat report on other military, economic and political fronts.</p>

        <p>Fatal Helicopter Crash in Iraq  Two American soldiers were killed and four were wounded when an airborne helicopter struck one on the ground at an airfield in the northern city of Mosul. The cause of the crash was unclear.</p>

        <p>Crossfire Kills Palestinian Girl  Israeli gunfire killed an 8-year-old Palestinian girl during shooting between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians fired mortars toward a nearby Jewish settlement, wounding four Israeli civilians, including a child. Israeli soldiers then returned fire.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Ukraine Candidate Tested Again  The opposition candidate for president in Ukraine, Viktor A. Yushchenko, returned to a Vienna hospital for the third time, for further testing to determine whether he had been poisoned and, if so, to identify the toxic substance.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Berlusconi Cleared of Charges  A panel of judges swept away corruption charges against Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. But it did not completely cleanse the suspicions of wrongdoing that have clouded his three turbulent years in office.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Warning on Colombian Militants  Colombian officials celebrated the disarmament of 1,400 right-wing paramilitary fighters in northeast Colombia, but rights groups and some lawmakers warned that the effort to demobilize the groups was moving too fast, with no verification of the results and no assurance that they could bring lasting peace.</p>

        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Setbacks for Anthrax Program  The government's $877 million project to create an anthrax vaccine to protect Americans from germ warfare is undergoing significant setbacks. For one thing, the vaccine is unproven in humans.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>A Question of International Law  The Supreme Court accepted an appeal from a death-row inmate in a case that questions whether the federal government can permit Texas to execute a Mexican whose rights under a binding international treaty were violated when he was tried and sentenced to death without Mexican officials being notified.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Unions to Pressure Wal-Mart  The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and more than a half-dozen unions are planning an unusual -- and unusually expensive -- campaign intended to pressure Wal-Mart to improve its benefits.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Weather Halts Search for Crew  Huge waves and freezing rain hampered efforts to search for six missing crewmen from a wrecked cargo ship that was spilling its oil into the Bering Sea, threatening a remote and ecologically fragile wildlife refuge in the Aleutian Islands.</p>

        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>Testing Advance on Cancer  New findings add to the evidence that genetic tests can help to predict whether breast cancer will recur, giving valuable guidance to doctors and patients about whether potentially toxic chemotherapy will be useful or can safely be avoided.</p>

        <p>Removal of Hawks' Nest  Causes Stir Across Nation  Since workers removed a red-tailed hawks' nest from a luxury co-op building, the move has been the focus of searing anger from those around the city and nation who saw the hawks as emblems of raw nature in a densely populated urban setting.</p>

        <p>Rent Assistance Plan O.K.'d  The Pataki administration approved a rent assistance plan worth $60 million a year to help families in New York City leave shelters, avoid eviction or obtain larger residences to reunite with children in foster care, while also setting limits on how long and how much they can collect.</p>
