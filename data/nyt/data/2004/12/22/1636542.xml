        <p>LUCKILY the nice Chinese family from Queens adopted us. They didn't have much choice. At Ocean Port Seafood Restaurant, a jumping dim sum house in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, diners get squeezed in whenever a seat or two opens up.</p>
        <p>Set in a neighborhood where the Carvel ice cream signs are lettered in Hebrew and the CD shop sells Italian music, Ocean Port is fast becoming a destination dim sum parlor.

        <p>On my first visit, the place was packed. So an accommodating waiter made room for me and a guest at a crowded table, using a few pink napkins to cover up the dim sum stains of diners who had gone before.</p>

        <p>LUCKILY the nice Chinese family from Queens adopted us. They didn't have much choice. At Ocean Port Seafood Restaurant, a jumping dim sum house in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, diners get squeezed in whenever a seat or two opens up.</p>
        <p>Set in a neighborhood where the Carvel ice cream signs are lettered in Hebrew and the CD shop sells Italian music, Ocean Port is fast becoming a destination dim sum parlor. The attraction is more than 100 seasonally adjusted dumplings and small plates assembled by Joe Ng, who said he has cooked in 10 states, often in Hilton hotels.</p>
        <p>On my first visit, the place was packed. So an accommodating waiter made room for me and a guest at a crowded table, using a few pink napkins to cover up the dim sum stains of diners who had gone before.</p>
        <p>We plopped down next to a large family several pots of tea into their Sunday yum cha. Yum cha means ''drink tea'' in Cantonese, and tea is vital to the perfect dim sum experience. Pouring a few cups with strangers is also a great way to make friends.</p>
        <p>It was our great luck to share a table with people who really knew their way around a dim sum cart. Without them we might not have learned two of Ocean Port's secrets: the suckling pig ($10.95), so crisp-skinned and tender that it was one reason the family drove in from Queens, and the chiu chow gow ($2.95), a translucent-skinned steamed dumpling usually reserved for celebrations.</p>
        <p>The soft, wet skin of the round dumplings held a pleasantly dry filling of evenly chopped peanuts, pork, celery, water chestnuts and shiitake mushrooms. Their flavor and the attention to detail that went into their creation were indicative of the quality of most of the little dishes that come flying from the kitchen on stainless steel carts. Most are between $1.95 and $2.95 per plate of three or four pieces, with a few dishes inching above that. On another visit, the bill for a party of five enthusiastic eaters barely topped $100. But bring cash; Ocean Port does not accept credit cards.</p>
        <p>The big, boxy room has the familiar feel of a Cantonese banquet hall. A few pieces of roast duck and pork hang in the front window. Sheets of specials written in Chinese hang on the walls. The major focal point is a big red wall in the back that showcases a gold phoenix and dragon.</p>
        <p>On the weekends, especially Sundays, the two dozen big tables are always full. You'll be bumped and jostled and have the occasional dish of braised pork spilled on your sleeve.</p>
        <p>It was hard to find a miss in the dozens of dumplings we ate our way through. Among the favorites: an open wrapper with a nugget of shrimp inside a wad of spinach sprinkled with scallion and parsley; a Shanghai-style pork meatball in a thin skin and shiny har-gow with shrimp that had a little snap to them.</p>
        <p>Beyond the dumplings, a plate of bean curd skins wrapped around shredded pork and tree fungus was perfect. We ordered extra plates of fried, thin-skinned peppers stuffed with shrimp paste and sucked tender morsels of meat from an order of braised fish jowls. For dessert, don't miss the fried green balls filled with sweet black sesame.</p>
        <p>The only dishes we did not like were mushy turnip cakes and a glass bowl filled with dry sticky rice studded with sweet Chinese sausage and mushrooms. Fish balls seasoned with ginger that were light and luscious when steamed became leaden in the deep-fat fryer.</p>
        <p>Most of the dishes on the dinner menu lacked the sparkle of the dim sum. On weeknights, when personal space isn't such an issue, diners can explore a expansive but less impressive mix of Cantonese and Sichuan dishes, including a soft, comforting corn soup with small nuggets of white chicken meat ($5.95), fresh pea shoots cooked with big cloves of braised garlic ($11.95) and crisp salt and pepper shrimp ($12.95).</p>
        <p>Ocean Port is open early for congee, offers a $4.50 lunch special of Chinese take-out standards and stays open until midnight, doing a healthy delivery business. But take a chance on the crowds and hit it for yum cha. You never know who you'll end up eating with.</p>
        <p>Ocean Port Seafood Restaurant  6202 18th Avenue (62nd Street), Bensonhurst, Brooklyn; (718) 236-8118.</p>
        <p>BEST DISHES -- Almost all the dim sum; roast suckling pig; pea shoots.  PRICE RANGE -- Most dim sum is $1.95 to $3.95; lunch special is $4.50. Seafood dishes are $6.95 to $13.95 with some daily specials higher.  CREDIT CARDS -- Cash only.  HOURS -- 7:30 a.m. to midnight daily.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- All on one level.</p>
