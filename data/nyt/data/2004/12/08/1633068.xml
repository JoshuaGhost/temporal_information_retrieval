        <p>Collaborators became competitors when the nominations for the 47th annual Grammy Awards were announced yesterday in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Kanye West received 10 nominations by working multiple jobs: as rapper on his album, ''The College Dropout,'' and as a producer and songwriter for ''The Diary of Alicia Keys.'' Both albums were nominated as album of the year, along with Ray Charles's collection of duets, ''Genius Loves Company,'' Green Day's punk-rock concept album, ''American Idiot,'' and Usher's rhythm-and-blues album ''Confessions,'' which includes a duet with Ms. Keys.</p>
        <p>Mr. West was nominated in three top Grammy categories: album and song of the year (for ''Jesus Walks'') and best new artist. ''The College Dropout'' defied recent hip-hop formulas by presenting Mr. West as a thoughtful, good-natured character without gangster trappings. His productions, for Ms. Keys and others, often sample old soul hits and can sound instantly familiar.</p>
        <p>Usher and Ms. Keys received eight nominations each, including one for record of the year (Usher's single ''Yeah!''). Mr. West, Ms. Keys and Usher are competing for the best R&amp;B song.</p>
        <p>''Genius Loves Company,'' the album of duets by Charles, brought him seven nominations, including album of the year and record of the year for his duet with Norah Jones, ''Here We Go Again.'' Both ''Genius Loves Company'' and Ms. Jones's ''Feels Like Home'' were nominated for best pop vocal album. While Ms. Jones's debut album, ''Come Away With Me,'' dominated last year's Grammy awards, ''Feels Like Home'' was not nominated in any top categories. Green Day's song and album ''American Idiot'' received six nominations.</p>
        <p>The other nominees for record of the year, a single were ''Let's Get It Started'' by the Black Eyed Peas and ''Heaven'' by the Texas band Los Lonely Boys. Nominees for song of the year also included Ms. Keys's ''If I Ain't Got You,'' John Mayer's ''Daughters,'' Hoobastank's ''Reason'' and Tim McGraw's country hit ''Live Like You Were Dying.'' Los Lonely Boys were nominated as best new artist along with Maroon 5, the British soul singer Joss Stone and the country singer Gretchen Wilson.</p>
        <p>Loretta Lynn's album ''Van Lear Rose,'' produced by Jack White of the White Stripes, garnered five nominations, including best country album. Two of her songs are competing for best country song, ''Miss Being Mrs.'' and ''Portland Oregon.'' Nominees for best country album also include Ms. Wilson, Mr. McGraw, Tift Merritt and Keith Urban. Mr. West, Jay-Z, the Beastie Boys, L.L. Cool J and Nelly were nominated for best rap album. Amid the Grammy Awards' confusingly differentiated categories, Ms. Keys, Prince, Anita Baker, Al Green and Jill Scott were nominated for best R&amp;B album, while Usher, Brandy, Janet Jackson, Christina Milian and Mario Winans were nominated for best contemporary R&amp;B album.</p>
        <p>The awards will be announced on Feb. 13 in a CBS broadcast from Los Angeles.</p>
