        <p>Planners for President Bush's inauguration next month have scheduled a full lineup of exclusive parties and receptions for top Republican fund-raisers. But some of those V.I.P.'s say the perks come with a price tag they cannot afford.</p>
        <p>Attending the entire slate of events during the three days of inauguration festivities could easily top $10,000 in tickets and other expenses for a fund-raiser bringing a spouse or guest. Some who helped bankroll the president's campaign, particularly young fund-raisers or those participating for the first time, are looking for ways to economize or are just planning to skip official events entirely.</p>
        <p>''I still don't know what to do for the inauguration because of costs,'' said Bradley D. Wine, a 34-year-old Washington lawyer and first-time fund-raiser who brought in at least $100,000 for the Bush campaign. ''I'll either get together with folks who are celebrating independent of the official events or observe from the sidelines.''</p>
        <p>The inauguration package being offered to top Bush and Republican Party fund-raisers asks for up to $2,500 per person, though both the fee and the events vary depending on how much people raised, according to a Web page run by LogiCom Project Management, the company handling the events and travel arrangements.</p>
        <p>The money covers admission to the Jan. 20 swearing-in, the parade, a black-tie ball and special events in Washington landmarks like the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the Willard InterContinental Hotel and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Another $2,500 per person is required for admission to one of three candlelight dinners at which the president and vice president will appear the evening before the inauguration. And, of course, there are airfare, hotel and other travel expenses.</p>
        <p>That will be no problem for many of Mr. Bush's wealthier fund-raisers. But the number of Republicans who raised six figures for the president doubled in this year's campaign, to about 550, in part because the campaign actively courted young professionals.</p>
        <p>Roughly 90 people under age 40 each raised at least $50,000 for Mr. Bush. Though they were effective fund-raisers, some say they cannot afford to spend endless amounts on politics.</p>
        <p>''I worked hard on this and I want to celebrate like everyone else, but at a certain point you have to draw the line,'' Mr. Wine said. ''I don't know that that's where we want to invest our money right now.''</p>
        <p>At Mr. Bush's first inauguration, fund-raisers also had to pay for admission to some parties and receptions but were not offered a package of events at a set price, inauguration officials said. With so many people on Mr. Bush's list of six-figure fund-raisers, organizers said the packages were an efficient way to accommodate them.</p>
        <p>''It will certainly cost those people more this time than last time,'' said Fred Meyer, who was chairman of the executive committee for the last inauguration.</p>
        <p>The political environment was different during the 2000 campaign, when political parties were raising unlimited soft-money contributions from wealthy donors who required care and feeding, Mr. Meyer said. New laws have banned those contributions.</p>
        <p>Fund-raisers are not required to attend the special parties or stay at fancy hotels, of course. Planners note that they can decline the inauguration packages and stay at less expensive hotels.</p>
        <p>''People have the option of coming to the inauguration and attending the events that are free of charge or buying tickets Ã  la carte,'' said Steve Schmidt, communications director for the Presidential Inaugural Committee.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many fund-raisers are cutting costs. Justin J. Sayfie, a 36-year-old Florida lawyer who raised at least $200,000 for Mr. Bush, said that he sought a less expensive hotel than was offered through LogiCom and was having his law firm pay part of his travel costs.</p>
        <p>''It's the first time that we get to participate so we are kind of excited,'' Mr. Sayfie said. ''It's not cheap, but it's a unique opportunity. I've been working 18 months to see this day.''</p>
        <p>He is also skipping the $2,500 candlelight dinner. ''I'd like to go,'' he said, ''but it's a stretch as it is.''</p>
        <p>Slater Bayliss, a 28-year-old Florida lawyer who raised at least $50,000, said he was looking forward to the inauguration, which he called a ''once- or twice-in-a-lifetime thing.'' But he is using a frequent flyer ticket to get to Washington and is likely to forgo the city's finer restaurants, and perhaps some inauguration events as well.</p>
        <p>''I probably wont be eating at the Caucus Room,'' Mr. Bayliss said.</p>
        <p>The Presidential Inaugural Committee raised at least $8 million through last week toward a tab that could top $40 million. Most of the money is coming from wealthy individuals and corporations, which can contribute up to $250,000. In return, top inaugural donors get stacks of tickets to events and admission to a special lunch with the president. The money collected from fund-raisers by LogiCom, which has a contract with the Republican National Committee, will similarly be used to offset the costs of various inauguration festivities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wine and other fund-raisers acknowledge that the events are expensive to produce and say they are not pointing fingers. But this is the second time this year that Republican fund-raisers have spoken out about the expense of attending political events. The Republican National Convention in New York drew complaints when fund-raisers were charged thousands of dollars to attend V.I.P. events.</p>
        <p>''This is obviously becoming the norm,'' said Bruce Bialosky, a California accountant who raised at least $100,000 for Mr. Bush. Conditioned by the cost of the convention, Mr. Bialosky said he was ready when it came time to pay to attend the inauguration.</p>
        <p>''It's the price of playing the game, I guess,'' he said.</p>
