        <p>A coroner confirmed on Tuesday that a body pulled from the wreckage of a plane that crashed on Sunday in Montrose, Colo., was that of the 14-year-old son of the chairman of NBC Sports, Dick Ebersol.</p>
        <p>Mark Young, the Montrose County coroner, said that the boy, Edward Ebersol, known as Teddy, died after being thrown from the plane, which then landed on top of him. ''He was killed instantly on impact,'' Mr. Young said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said the pilot, Luis Alberto Polanco, 50, and the flight attendant, Warren T. Richardson III, 36, were also killed on impact. The co-pilot, Eric S. Wicksell, was in critical condition in a Denver hospital.</p>
        <p>Dick Ebersol, 57, and his 21-year-old son, Charles, who was also on the plane, were hospitalized in Grand Junction, Colo. Both were in stable condition, NBC said.</p>
        <p>The charter plane had stopped in Montrose to drop off Mr. Ebersol's wife, the actress Susan Saint James, and was headed for South Bend, Ind., where Charles Ebersol attends the University of Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>Arnold Scott, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday that the cockpit voice recording was of ''good recording quality'' and was 31 minutes long including ''the entire accident sequence.'' Mr. Scott would not say when the text of the recording would be made public.</p>
        <p>Officials are still investigating the cause of the crash. It was snowy and foggy at the time, and the pilot chose not to have the plane de-iced before takeoff. The plane, built in 1983, was in ''total working order,'' said a spokesman for its operator, Jet Alliance. The pilot had been an employee of Jet Alliance since May.</p>
        <p>The Ebersol family released a statement on Tuesday expressing grief for Teddy, who they noted was a Red Sox fan with a ''quirky sense of humor,'' as well as sympathy for the families of the other crash victims.</p>
