        <p>Derek Jeter has grown up a Yankee, so he has learned never to be surprised. When he visited Legends Field in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 16 to talk with the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, about the Michigan-Ohio State football game, Jeter was not surprised to see Pedro Martínez show up.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't shocked to see Pedro,'' Jeter said. ''Like I've said time and time again: nothing shocks me.''</p>

        <p>Derek Jeter has grown up a Yankee, so he has learned never to be surprised. When he visited Legends Field in Tampa, Fla., on Nov. 16 to talk with the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, about the Michigan-Ohio State football game, Jeter was not surprised to see Pedro Martínez show up.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't shocked to see Pedro,'' Jeter said. ''Like I've said time and time again: nothing shocks me.''</p>
        <p>Jeter said hello to Martínez, but not much else. Some of Jeter's teammates have publicly embraced the notion of Martínez joining the Yankees, but Jeter seems to prefer the idea of Martínez staying in Boston.</p>
        <p>''Honestly, I like facing Pedro,'' Jeter said. ''You talk about the rivalry, that's part of it. You get the opportunity to face one of the best pitchers in baseball.''</p>
        <p>But Jeter would not mind seeing the Yankees sign another Martinez, Tino, his close friend and the first baseman on four Yankees championship teams. Tino Martinez played for Tampa Bay last season and is a free agent.</p>
        <p>''He's been with us, he's been on teams that won, he understands what it takes to win,'' Jeter said. ''But that's not saying that if Tino came back, we'd all of a sudden win.''</p>
