        <p>But It Did Enable Her To Be Briefly Airborne</p>
        <p>It was quiet at Guastavino's when LEONARDO DICAPRIO arrived. The crowd from the New York premiere of ''The Aviator,'' in which he stars as HOWARD HUGHES, had not yet arrived from the screening.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio, wearing a gray suit, walked through the room, speaking on his cellphone. A small gang of people trailed him: his personal publicist, his family, a few men in suits. The gang of people became larger as he headed to the back of the room, where a large round table had been set up for him. Mr. DiCaprio was quickly given a glass of red wine.</p>

        <p>But It Did Enable Her To Be Briefly Airborne</p>
        <p>It was quiet at Guastavino's when LEONARDO DICAPRIO arrived. The crowd from the New York premiere of ''The Aviator,'' in which he stars as HOWARD HUGHES, had not yet arrived from the screening.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio, wearing a gray suit, walked through the room, speaking on his cellphone. A small gang of people trailed him: his personal publicist, his family, a few men in suits. The gang of people became larger as he headed to the back of the room, where a large round table had been set up for him. Mr. DiCaprio was quickly given a glass of red wine.</p>
        <p>GISELE BÃœNDCHEN had not yet arrived. When she did, there were no exhibitionist kisses, no big gestures. They chatted. He kissed her on the cheek, then on the lips. Then she went to the buffet.</p>
        <p>''The Aviator,'' directed by MARTIN SCORSESE, portrays Mr. Hughes from the late 1920's through the early 40's, when he was making films, designing and testing aircraft, and, as seen in the movie, showing signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder. He was also germphobic.</p>
        <p>Earlier we had talked with Mr. DiCaprio on the red carpet.</p>
        <p>What interested you about Mr. Hughes?</p>
        <p>''His empire, commercial aviation. He was, you know, a man ultimately obsessed by germs and he became one of the most complex lives I ever read about,'' Mr. DiCaprio said.</p>
        <p>Did you meet KATHARINE HEPBURN?</p>
        <p>''No, I didn't, she actually passed away during the filming of the movie,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still the dance is the dance, and after Mr. DiCaprio's publicist, KEN SUNSHINE, introduced us, we asked the actor if he had learned to fly for the part.</p>
        <p>''Nope, '' Mr. DiCaprio said. ''I learned how to simulate how to fly and I worked with a pilot.''</p>
        <p>We considered this. So basically, we said, you learned how to fly enough to crash into a tall building.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio looked surprised, then started to laugh.</p>
        <p>''Hey, that is really bad New York humor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>We agree; we just wanted to see how you'd react, we said. ''As long as we establish the writer made the comment,'' Mr. DiCaprio added.</p>
        <p>He loosened his tie and seemed to loosen up himself. But it was fleeting. Sometimes he was a guy talking, sometimes he was an actor promoting a film. He talked about Mr. Hughes's will, saying it was a pity it all went to the lawyers instead of being used for something important.</p>
        <p>He also mentioned that he had met JANE RUSSELL.</p>
        <p>Did she show you the bra Mr. Hughes designed for her?</p>
        <p>''No, she just said that it was a crummy bra and it hurt,'' Mr. DiCaprio said. ''But he did spend months designing it.''</p>
        <p>He talked about the obsessions of Mr. Hughes, about learning about obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
        <p>''He put the same amount of attention as he put in the bra in the Spruce Goose, the germs, and every movie. Once he put his mind to something, he could not be distracted,'' Mr. DiCaprio said. ''He was an obsessive-compulsive. He would not stop until he got the right feeling. And sometimes these things were not great accomplishments. 'The Outlaw' was not a great accomplishment.''</p>
        <p>Does Mr. DiCaprio ever take on the traits of the characters he plays?</p>
        <p>''I think I don't have O.C.D.,'' Mr. DiCaprio said. ''But, like, when I was doing research, I remembered things that I did as a kid. I remember doing obsessive things when I was younger. That came out a lot during the movie, because I remember wanting to do the things I did as a weird, obsessive child.''</p>
        <p>Oh?</p>
        <p>''I would have to step on things, you know. I would have to step on stuff on the sidewalk,'' he said, acting it out, looking down at the ground, pretending to step on things.</p>
        <p>Does he do that now?</p>
        <p>''No, it's all kind of gone. But I let it loose for the movie.''</p>
        <p>We thanked him for his time and went to say hello to LAUREN BACALL, who said that CATE BLANCHETT, who played Katharine Hepburn, was great.</p>
        <p>''Katie Hepburn was a great friend of mine,'' Ms. Bacall said. ''Cate Blanchett had her mannerisms, expressions, everything.''</p>
        <p>Oscars?</p>
        <p>''Don't ask me about the Oscars,'' Ms. Bacall said. ''I don't give a damn about the Oscars.''</p>
        <p>A young woman went by with a tray of crab cakes.</p>
        <p>''Hey, hey, why did you pass me?'' Ms. Bacall said. ''Where are you going? What are they? You got some nerve walking over there.''</p>
