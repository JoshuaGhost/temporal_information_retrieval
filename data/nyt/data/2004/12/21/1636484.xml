        <p>Jeremy Eichler reviews concert by British cellist Steven Isserlis, violinists Joshua Bell and Todd Phillips, violists Paul Neubauer and Robert Rinehart and pianist Kirill Gerstein (M)</p>

        <p>Ad Hoc, Maybe, But Not at Odds  'Steven Isserlis and Friends'  Zankel Hall</p>
        <p>When it comes to chamber music, beware of ad-hoc ensembles and would-be dream teams. Soloists keep notoriously busy schedules that allow for little preparation, and the repertory makes ensemble demands that are not easily fudged in the concert hall. This listener was thus not sure what to expect on Thursday night as the British cellist Steven Isserlis took the stage of Zankel Hall for an evening of chamber music to which he had invited the violinists Joshua Bell and Todd Phillips, the violists Paul Neubauer and Robert Rinehart and the pianist Kirill Gerstein.</p>
        <p>In the end, the all-Dvorak program came together surprisingly well. Of the group, Mr. Bell and Mr. Isserlis have the most active solo careers, and both seemed to relish the chance to take the night off from concertos. And while the performances were hardly flawless, the evening provided more ensemble unity, interpretive subtlety and robust, full-bodied playing than one often finds with eclectic groups of this nature. Mr. Isserlis's tone was uncommonly sweet and had the natural feel of a singing voice. One also appreciated Mr. Gerstein's emotive pianism in the Piano Quartet No. 2 (Op. 87) and Mr. Bell's charismatic swooping through the various first-violin parts: even when he was playing in a collaborative chamber group, his body language betrayed his day job.</p>

        <p>The expressive momentum and collegial rapport built through the evening's final work, the ''American'' Quintet (Op. 104), in which the timbre of the two violists made a rich alto sound and Mr. Isserlis, ever the amiable host, grounded the ensemble with warm autumnal playing in the bass.</p>
