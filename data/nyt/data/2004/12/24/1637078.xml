        <p>The season ended for New England cornerback Tyrone Poole last Saturday when he was placed on the injured reserve list with a sore knee.</p>
        <p>Another cornerback, Ty Law, the perennial Pro Bowl selection, has missed the last seven games with a sore foot, and it is unclear when he will return to the lineup. The Patriots' secondary is so banged up that for weeks, Troy Brown, a wide receiver, has taken the field as a fifth defensive back.</p>
        <p>While it would seem that the Patriots' patchwork secondary would be an easy target, the Jets' offense appears to be treading cautiously as it prepares for Sunday's game against New England at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>There is much at stake: the Jets (10-4) would clinch an American Football Conference playoff berth with a victory, while a triumph by the Patriots (12-2) would guarantee them a first-round bye in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Even though their defensive backfield is thin, the Patriots have gone 6-2 since Law was injured in their loss to Pittsburgh, just one more testament to how resourceful the team has been under Coach Bill Belichick.</p>
        <p>''They know how to play defense,'' Jets quarterback Chad Pennington said.</p>
        <p>The Patriots coaches have covered their holes in the secondary by using an assortment of defensive schemes and disguising some packages.</p>
        <p>''They do a great job,'' Coach Herman Edwards said of the Patriots' ability to compensate for personnel losses. ''They've done a really great job when you talk about guys that have been injured and they still win games.''</p>
        <p>Last week, New England started a rookie, Randall Gay, and a second-year player, Asante Samuel, at cornerback, and still held the Dolphins to 179 passing yards. The Patriots had an 11-point lead late in the game before Miami stunned them by rallying for a 29-28 victory.</p>
        <p>The Patriots' secondary did have several lapses, including a costly pass-interference penalty on safety Rodney Harrison that led to one Miami score and a coverage error by Brown, who gave up the 21-yard, game-winning touchdown on a fourth-down play.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins threw in the direction of Brown with success several times, leading to the suggestion that teams are beginning to figure out how to exploit his inexperience. Brown, with 12 years as an N.F.L. receiver, has been playing defensive back since Nov. 7.</p>
        <p>Edwards, a former cornerback, praised Brown's ability to adapt to playing defense and said that critics should not read too much into his having given up the winning touchdown.</p>
        <p>''That goes along with the position,'' Edwards said. ''When you get beat, everyone remembers what you get beat on rather than the good ones you knocked away.''</p>
        <p>Belichick seems to have mixed feelings about the results of the cutting and pasting in the secondary.</p>
        <p>''It is what it is,'' he said. ''Sometimes, it's been better than others. Guys that don't have a lot of experience are seeing some new things for the first time and also getting better at working with each other.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots must also hope that several key players get healthy soon. There are five defensive backs on New England's injury report this week, including Gay (sore arm) and Samuel (sore shoulder), who are each listed as questionable. Law is listed as doubtful and has not practiced this week.</p>
        <p>Jets receiver Santana Moss said that it mattered little to him who played in the Patriots' secondary. ''Regardless of who's out there, you have to go out there and make sure you are the better guy that day or that down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Moss and the rest of the Jets will also be confronting the Patriots' disguises. ''They use different personnel groups,'' Edwards said. ''They give you different looks.'' One look includes a formation in which New England replaces its defensive linemen with linebackers. But in the end, Pennington said, the Patriots excel because they are strong in the fundamental aspects of the game.</p>
        <p>''They are doing a great job of reading patterns and getting in receivers' faces and knocking them off their timing,'' Pennington said. ''It's going to be a dogfight. It's going to be scratch and claw.''</p>
