      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>1. KANYE WEST, 'THE COLLEGE DROPOUT' (Roc-a-Fella/Island Def Jam) On his classic debut album, this mischievous rapper-producer doesn't hide his excitement: he sings along to his own spliced-soul beats, thrills to his own tall tales of triumph and disappointment, chuckles at his own endless supply of shameless jokes. There's only one sensible response: Join him.</p>
        <p>2. GRETCHEN WILSON, 'HERE FOR THE PARTY' (Epic/Sony Nashville) Ms. Wilson's debut album is packed with playful Southern rock, including the rowdy breakthrough hit ''Redneck Woman.'' But the ballads are even better, especially ''When I Think About Cheatin','' a paradoxical love song (contemplating infidelity never sounded so romantic) that's already a country classic.</p>
        <p>3. CAM'RON, 'PURPLE HAZE' (Roc-a-Fella/Island Def Jam) A rapper who is meaner, weirder and smarter than the competition. Over beats both wistful and menacing, Cam'ron turns blunt threats into jabberwockian verse (''Rap with the rappers/Scrap with the actors/Cap back, abracadabra''), losing himself in the language of power and the power of language.</p>
        <p>4. JOANNA NEWSOM, 'THE MILK-EYED MENDER' (Drag City) This extraordinary harpist has a glorious, untamed voice and a sheaf of tricky song-poems. Ms. Newsom wraps her puns and pleas in shimmering, kora-inspired harp figures, conjuring one startlingly vivid image after another: ''Across the sky sheet the impossible birds/In a steady, illiterate movement homewards.''</p>
        <p>5. MODEST MOUSE, 'GOOD NEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE BAD NEWS' (Sony) Modest Mouse once seemed too ornery to make an album this lovable. ''As life gets longer, awful feels softer/And it feels pretty soft to me,'' Isaac Brock sings, and his band makes a joyful noise, from clattering folk-punk to sleek new wave.</p>
        <p>6. DADDY YANKEE, 'BARRIO FINO' (VI/Universal) On this restless and ferocious CD, Daddy Yankee spits rapid-fire rhymes to match his machine-gun beats. He's one of the biggest stars in Puerto Rico's booming reggaeton scene, and in his swaggering party tracks you can hear a whole universe of music, from salsa to techno.</p>
        <p>7. THE ARCADE FIRE, 'FUNERAL' (Merge) A grand, passionate indie-rock debut from Montreal. The music surges and retreats, buoyed by swelling strings and full-throated choirs, while RÃ©gine Chassagne and her husband, Win Butler, sing of freak snowstorms and ruined families and other not-quite-natural disasters.</p>
        <p>8. CRIME MOB, 'CRIME MOB' (BME/Reprise) The year's best crunk album comes from these hyper-rowdy Georgia teenagers (four boys, two girls). Over tinkling, minor-key synthesizers and hard-knocking beats, they gleefully hurl abuse at anyone stupid enough to come to the club looking for a good time: why dance when you can fight?</p>
        <p>9. 'BONNIE ''PRINCE'' BILLY SINGS GREATEST PALACE MUSIC' (Drag City) On this sly and lovely CD, Will Oldham convenes an A-list band to Nashville-ize his ''greatest'' nonhits. It's a funny idea but it's not a joke, and after the extreme makeover (supple pedal steel, plaintive fiddle, Marty Slayton's lovely descants), it's even easier to hear the warm, weird glow of these songs.</p>
        <p>10. ADA, 'BLONDIE' (Areal/Kompakt) Ada is a singer-producer from Cologne, Germany, the epicenter of electronic minimalism. And yet the meticulous (and danceable) computer compositions on ''Blondie'' find ways to gesture toward pop. The most obvious gesture: ''Maps,'' her whispery, intoxicating cover of last year's Yeah Yeah Yeahs hit.</p>
        <p>And singles: 1. CIARA FEATURING LIL JON AND PETEY PABLO, 'GOODIES' (LaFace); 2. USHER FEATURING LIL JON, 'YEAH!' (Arista/BMG); 3. JULIE ROBERTS, 'BREAK DOWN HERE' (Mercury/Nashville); 4. BRITNEY SPEARS, 'TOXIC' (Jive); 5. LIL SCRAPPY, 'NO PROBLEM' (Reprise); 6. M.I.A., 'GALANG' (XL); 7. AKON FEATURING STYLES P, 'LOCKED UP (REMIX)' (SRC/Universal); 8. MARIO WINANS FEATURING ENYA, 'I DON'T WANNA KNOW' (Bad Boy/Universal); 9. SNOOP DOGG, 'DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT' (Geffen/Universal); 10. LORETTA LYNN FEATURING JACK WHITE, 'PORTLAND OREGON' (Interscope/Universal)</p>
