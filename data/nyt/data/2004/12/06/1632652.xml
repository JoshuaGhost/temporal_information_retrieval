        <p>When Wal-Mart Stores set up shop in Brazil in 1995, many here thought it would take the market, South America's largest, by storm. But unlike Wal-Mart's experience in Mexico, where an aggressive strategy of acquisitions rapidly made it a dominant force, its early years in Brazil were largely uneventful.</p>
        <p>In its first 10 years here, Wal-Mart stepped cautiously, opening just 25 stores in four of Brazil's 27 states. Wal-Mart also struggled to adapt to local tastes, after initially stocking its stores with products that are standard in the United States -- like golf clubs and lawn mowers -- but of little interest to most Brazilians.</p>
        <p>But after early growing pains, Wal-Mart now appears to be coming into its own in Brazil. Last March it made its first acquisition, buying a 118-store supermarket chain called Bompreço in the northeast for $300 million from the Dutch retailer Ahold. The purchase took Wal-Mart from sixth place to third in the country's retail rankings, behind the local chain Pão de Açúcar, backed by the Casino Group of France, and the French retailer Carrefour.</p>
        <p>''It took them a decade to figure out that organic growth isn't the way to grow in Brazil, but now they are more in tune with Brazilian consumers and have shifted to a more aggressive strategy,'' said Márcio Kawassaki, a retail analyst at Fator Doria Atherino, a São Paulo brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart has already signaled that it does not intend to stop with the Bompreço acquisition, which effectively gave it control of the retail market in the northeast. The retailer is now opening stores at its fastest pace since its arrival in Brazil, putting it on track to finish the year with 147 stores in 13 states. More acquisitions may also be on the horizon.</p>
        <p>''We're interested in growing in Brazil, both organically and through more acquisitions,'' said Aprígio Rello Jr., vice president for corporate affairs and logistics at Wal-Mart Brasil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rello says Wal-Mart is shopping for opportunities all over Brazil. But analysts say the retailer's next stop may be the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, a region dominated by family-owned supermarket chains that are ripe for picking.</p>
        <p>''Wal-Mart's best chance to gain ground on its rivals is by buying in the south,'' Mr. Kawassaki said.</p>
