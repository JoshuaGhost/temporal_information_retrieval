        <p>Two experimental drugs are showing strong early results in treating patients with a blood cancer that has grown resistant to the most commonly prescribed medicine, doctors reported here on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The existing drug, Gleevec, has been widely hailed as a wonder drug because it prolonged lives and directly aimed at the aberrant enzyme that causes chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease marked by an overgrowth of certain white blood cells. But the majority of patients with the most advanced form of the disease become resistant to Gleevec, and even 16 percent of those given the drug when the disease is first diagnosed become resistant by 40 months, said Charles L. Sawyers, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>Two experimental drugs are showing strong early results in treating patients with a blood cancer that has grown resistant to the most commonly prescribed medicine, doctors reported here on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The existing drug, Gleevec, has been widely hailed as a wonder drug because it prolonged lives and directly aimed at the aberrant enzyme that causes chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease marked by an overgrowth of certain white blood cells. But the majority of patients with the most advanced form of the disease become resistant to Gleevec, and even 16 percent of those given the drug when the disease is first diagnosed become resistant by 40 months, said Charles L. Sawyers, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Two new drugs, one from Bristol-Myers Squibb and the other by Novartis, which also developed Gleevec, might pick up where Gleevec leaves off, doctors reported at the American Society of Hematology meeting here.</p>
        <p>The Bristol drug, known now as BMS-354825, returned white blood cell counts to normal in 86 percent of 36 patients with the early phase of the disease, Dr. Sawyers said. Such a response makes people feel normal though it does not wipe out the underlying cause of the disease. In 29 patients with more advanced stages of disease, a majority had blood cell counts improve or return to normal, but it was too soon to tell how long the improvements would last.</p>
        <p>''Some of them have one or two weeks to live,'' said Dr. Moshe Talpaz of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who helped conduct the trial. ''To see them improve is very dramatic.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the test had small numbers of patients, without a control group, and was the first stage of clinical trials. But promising cancer drugs for which there is no alternative can reach the market after only two stages of trials instead of the usual three, making it conceivable the drug could reach the market in a couple of years, Dr. Talpaz said.</p>
        <p>The new Novartis drug, AMN107, is also in the first phase of testing. Of 65 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or a related disease called acute lymphocytic leukemia, more than 50 percent have had some response to the drug, according to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.</p>
