        <p>Fog and freezing weather that covered roadways with ice caught some New Jersey drivers off guard yesterday, resulting in crashes that killed two people, the state police said.</p>
        <p>A 40-year-old woman was killed around 7 a.m. when her car, which was involved in a multiple-vehicle crash, was broadsided by a pickup truck on the Garden State Parkway in Bass River Township in Burlington County, Trooper Stephen Jones of the state police said. He identified the woman as Patricia Harrington of Toms River.</p>
        <p>In Middlesex County, a 62-year-old woman, whom Trooper Jones identified as Joan S. Smith of Colonia, died after her 1991 Buick LeSabre struck a bridge abutment along the Garden State Parkway in Old Bridge Township shortly after 8 a.m.</p>
        <p>The accidents were two of several that occurred as temperatures dipped below freezing, causing fog to form patches of ice on the roadway, a spokesman for the National Weather Service said. Freezing rain later in the day led to more crashes.</p>
        <p>Yesterday evening, state troopers in Essex and Union Counties raced to the scenes of numerous crashes along Routes 287, 280 and Interstate 80, where more than 30 accidents were reported in a four-hour period in the early evening. No one was seriously injured, Trooper Jones said.</p>
        <p>The Burlington County accident that killed Ms. Harrington yesterday morning was the second at that site in a half hour. Around 6:30 a.m., a state trooper who was laying warning flares on the road around a multiple-car crash was nearly struck by another vehicle, but he suffered only minor injuries when he leaped away.</p>
        <p>The day began with a 22-car crash shortly before 6:30 a.m. along the Garden State Parkway in Somers Point, near Atlantic City, Trooper Jones said. No serious injuries were reported, he said. Temperatures are expected to remain below freezing today, reaching a high of about 20 degrees, said a spokesman for the National Weather Service.</p>
