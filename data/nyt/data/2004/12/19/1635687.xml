        <p>A SMALL CHRISTMAS. Written and illustrated by Wong Herbert Yee. Houghton Mifflin. $12.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Dear little Fireman Small is back in his fourth adventure. Helping Mayor Mole find a Christmas tree is fine and easy; it's helping a tired Santa Claus that tests the firefighter's imagination and enterprising spirit.</p>
        <p>O HOLY NIGHT: Christmas With the Boys Choir of Harlem. Illustrated by Faith Ringgold. HarperCollins/ Amistad. $18.99. (All ages) Here's a lush invitation to sing along. The texts of five carols -- besides the title song, they are ''Silent Night,'' ''O Come, All Ye Faithful'' ''Hark! the Herald Angels Sing'' and ''Joy to the World'' -- are set against jewel-toned illustrations of the Nativity. A CD of the Boys Choir singing the carols is tucked in the back cover.</p>

        <p>FEDERICO AND THE MAGI'S GIFT: A Latin American Christmas Story. Written and illustrated by Beatriz Vidal. Knopf. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) The festival of Epiphany is observed in a small mountain village somewhere in South America. As part of the summertime celebration, children look into the night sky searching for the Wise Men riding through the stars who are possibly bringing presents. The youngsters gather hay and water for the camels and make their wish lists. Little Federico longs for for a toy horse. Charming illustrations, including a glimpse of the night sky from the Southern Hemisphere. Young readers will also notice the unmentioned black cat who dances through the pages.</p>
        <p>THE PETERKINS' CHRISTMAS. By Lucretia P. Hale. Adapted by Elizabeth Spurr. Illustrated by Wendy Anderson Halperin. Atheneum. $16.95. (Ages 7 to 10) By way of an introduction to a classic children's book family only older folks can possibly remember, this charmingly illustrated episode is adapted from ''The Peterkin Papers.'' The fact that the Christmas tree is far too large for the house leads to wonderfully silly complications and, of course, a happy holiday ending.</p>
        <p>SANTA'S LAST PRESENT. By Marie-Aude Murail and Elvire Murail. Illustrated by Quentin Blake. Peachtree Press. $12.95. (Ages 7 and up) When Julian starts to doubt Santa's existence, he gets the video game he asked for -- and finds another package under the tree, with a plain old train that his parents don't recognize. Believing and not believing, Julian worries that Santa might take his beloved train away when Christmas rolls around again.</p>
        <p>HOW MANY MILES TO BETHLEHEM? By Kevin Crossley-Holland. Illustrated by Peter Malone. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $16.95. (All ages) The story of the Nativity is told briefly by many who were there, including Mary, the innkeeper, some of the animals, the brightest star and the Wise Men. The fine, delicate illustrations bring to mind Italian Renaissance paintings.</p>
        <p>SANTA'S LITTLEST HELPER. By Anu Stohner. Illustrated by Henrike Wilson. Bloomsbury. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) He really is Santa's best helper, and a very good baker, too. Still, because of his size, Santa won't take him on that ride. Then, in the forest one Christmas Eve, the Littlest Helper finds his true calling, making sure there are gifts for everyone.</p>
        <p>A FIREFLY IN A FIR TREE: A Carol for Mice. Written and illustrated by Hilary Knight. Katherine Tegen/ HarperCollins. $14.99. (Ages 4 to 8) This charming variation on the ''Twelve Days of Christmas,'' based on the conceit of a sketchbook of a holiday celebration given by the mice in the author's studio, was first published in 1963. It remains perfectly delightful.</p>
