        <p>The Gingerbread Man Hot Salt Scrub  Picture a crowd, excited and demonstrative to the point of ecstasy. The source of their enthusiasm is not mystical but worldly: they are about to receive a lot of free products. In a post-election poll that aimed to put a different spin on the ''values'' debate, a plurality of voters named ''greed and materialism'' as America's most pressing moral issue, but it is hard to imagine any politician having the courage to challenge the idol presiding over this ceremony, because her name is Oprah Winfrey, and the blissed-out crowd is her studio audience.</p>
        <p>Just before the holiday season, ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' devotes an episode to the host's ''favorite things.'' Those lucky enough to be in attendance get one of every product that Winfrey says she loves. And many of those not lucky enough to be in the audience immediately start buying those products. The effect of a Winfrey blessing on sales is intense. To take a single example, one year ago Winfrey gave away a product called the Gingerbread Man Hot Salt Scrub, from Philosophy, a cosmetics company based in Phoenix. The company had to rearrange its production schedule to meet the resulting surge in demand: for two months straight, Philosophy made salt scrub, working weekends and double shifts and putting its other core skin-care items on back order. ''The Oprah factor,'' says Cristina Carlino, Philosophy's founder and C.E.O., ''is real.''</p>

        <p>Just before the holiday season, ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' devotes an episode to the host's ''favorite things.'' Those lucky enough to be in attendance get one of every product that Winfrey says she loves. And many of those not lucky enough to be in the audience immediately start buying those products. The effect of a Winfrey blessing on sales is intense. To take a single example, one year ago Winfrey gave away a product called the Gingerbread Man Hot Salt Scrub, from Philosophy, a cosmetics company based in Phoenix. The company had to rearrange its production schedule to meet the resulting surge in demand: for two months straight, Philosophy made salt scrub, working weekends and double shifts and putting its other core skin-care items on back order. ''The Oprah factor,'' says Cristina Carlino, Philosophy's founder and C.E.O., ''is real.''</p>
        <p>That installment of the show, as recorded in the official transcript, opened with Oprah Winfrey trying to calm her thrilled audience. ''Everybody sit down,'' she said. ''Everybody sit down. O.K. O.K. O.K. Let me get your attention. O.K. Everybody, everybody, let's just all breathe together. Take a deep breath and let it out. . . . Have a seat. Have a seat. O.K. Have a seat. Can you hear me?'' Then she notes that by the end of the hour, the audience members will walk out with more than $1.5 million worth of stuff -- from cashmere sweaters to coconut macaroons -- ''personally selected by me.'' The transcript records the audience response as, ''Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah!''</p>
        <p>Philosophy was founded in 1996 and now makes hundreds of products that are available at places like Sephora and Nordstrom, as well as on the shopping channel QVC. It combines natural ingredients, minimalist packaging and spiritual-sounding product names like Amazing Grace Olive Oil Scrub or Hope in a Jar skin cream. The latter was featured in a 1999 installment of Oprah's Favorite Things, and that event, Carlino is happy to say, ''completely changed the trajectory of this company.''</p>
        <p>Almost no one will flat-out admit to buying something just because they think a celebrity likes it. But clearly it happens, and everyone knows it, from the makers of talk shows (the producers of Ellen DeGeneres's show are reportedly negotiating potential giveaway deals) to the editors of Psychology Today, which recently devoted a cover article to an analysis of celebrity worship. (''Humans naturally copy techniques from high-status individuals,'' the magazine noted.)</p>
        <p>The tricky thing here is whether, toughened by decades of paid star endorsements and years of paid product placements, the rest of us have grown too cynical to care. Oprah's people insist that her Favorite Things really are her favorite things and not paid placements. Of course, featured companies do have to donate the products. In a much-publicized episode earlier this year, Winfrey gave away 276 Pontiac G6's, worth upward of $7 million but probably garnering General Motors publicity worth a good deal more. Still, the real P.R. winner is ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' which also gets endless free press simply for giving away someone else's goods.</p>
        <p>And while the Oprah effect is most acute just after the show is on, it is also lasting; Carlino points out that Hope in a Jar remains one of Philosophy's top sellers. The Gingerbread Man scrub continues to do well, too. Carlino understands why Winfrey's faithful are willing, even eager, to take cues from the talk-show host. Carlino is busy running a company, but she will ''make time'' to watch the show and just the other day picked up tips on how to organize her closet. Talking about the Oprah Effect on her own life, she sounds almost emotional. ''She is our heart and soul,'' Carlino says. ''I trust her. I trust her.''</p>
