        <p>With three days remaining until legislative elections on Saturday, the streets here echo with slogans belted out from truck-mounted loudspeakers belonging to the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the smallest but fastest growing of Taiwan's main political parties.</p>
        <p>The T.S.U., as it is known, favors immediate steps toward greater independence from mainland China. It has benefited from a strong and unexpected surge in opinion polls here in the last two weeks.</p>
        <p>The party wants a new constitution that would make it clear that Taiwan is separate from the mainland. The party is also calling for changes to the flag, the national anthem and other symbols of Taiwan's heritage as part of China. ''We can help Taiwan be a more normal country,'' said Lee Shang-ren, the director of the party's policy center.</p>
        <p>The policies are anathema to Beijing, which has threatened war if Taiwan moves too far toward independence. But they are also alarming to Washington, which does not want a conflict now in this part of the world, especially while large numbers of American soldiers are in Iraq and while the United States is seeking Beijing's help in dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>The Taiwan Solidarity Union is too small to play a leading role in the 225-member legislature. It now holds 12 seats, and recent polls suggest that it may have 17 to 20 seats after Saturday's elections.</p>
        <p>But growing support for the party has forced President Chen Shui-bian and his governing Democratic Progressive Party to tilt further toward independence as well, a trend that could be a harbinger of increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen won two presidential elections by promising voters that he would stand up to Beijing more than would the Nationalist Party, which ran Taiwan for the half-century after the Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. The Nationalists, now the main opposition party here, still favor eventual political reunification with the mainland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen has slowly widened the political gap between Taiwan and the mainland through steps like the national referendum held in March on increasing defense spending if Chinese missiles continue to be pointed at the island. But he has stopped short of the more confrontational measures favored by the Taiwan Solidarity Union, partly because of American pressure.</p>
        <p>Hsiao Bi-khim, one of the Democratic Progressive Party's most popular lawmakers and a former spokeswoman for the president, said that some of her party's most pro-independence supporters were campaigning for the Taiwan Solidarity Union this year, and that this was forcing President Chen to shift his stance as well.</p>
        <p>''I guess the fundamentalists are a bit disappointed in our administration'' for not having moved Taiwan even further in the direction of independence, she said in an interview on Wednesday night in a minivan on the way to a campaign stop. ''The T.S.U. has made him feel compelled to consolidate our traditional supporters.''</p>
        <p>Hours before a T.S.U. rally on Sunday, Mr. Chen unexpectedly announced that he wanted to change ''China'' to ''Taiwan'' in the name of state-owned enterprises like China Telecom. He also proposed to change the name to Taiwan on the economic and cultural offices that it maintains in more than 70 countries, including the United States, that recognize Beijing instead of Taipei.</p>
        <p>Beijing has said little in response so far, but a State Department spokesman in Washington criticized the proposed name changes.</p>
