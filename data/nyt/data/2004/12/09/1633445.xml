        <p>It has been a bad week for a bundle of shows on Broadway. Three productions announced their impending closings on Tuesday, including ''Dracula, the Musical,'' and Eve Ensler's one-woman show, ''The Good Body,'' left, both of which will end on Jan. 2. Each will close at a loss. The biggest loser, however, is probably the Bollywood-inspired musical ''Bombay Dreams,'' which will close on Jan. 1 and looks to have lost a large part of the $14 million it took to stage the show on Broadway. A marginal hit in its first incarnation in London, ''Bombay Dreams'' opened in April with high hopes of drawing a large crowd of Southeast Asian Bollywood fans to Broadway. But the reviews were mediocre, and sales soon followed suit. It will have played 31 previews and 284 regular performances at the Broadway Theater by the closing date. Elizabeth Williams, one of its producers, said ''Bombay Dreams'' would have a national tour beginning during the 2005-6 season. When ''The Good Body'' completes its run at the Booth Theater on Jan. 2, it will have played 27 previews and 56 regular performances. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' at the Belasco, will have played 22 previews and 157 performances.</p>
