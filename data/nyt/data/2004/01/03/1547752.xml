        <p>A Staten Island math teacher was arrested in Brooklyn yesterday on drug and weapons charges, according to the police.</p>
        <p>Narcotics detectives said they saw the teacher, Dennis Loffredo, 50, sitting in the back seat of a parked S.U.V. at the corner of 57th Street and Fort Hamilton Parkway about 4:20 p.m. Mr. Loffredo, who lives on Staten Island and teaches at Tottenville High School, was making what appeared to be a drug purchase, according to the police.</p>
        <p>The detectives found 51 grams of cocaine and a 9 mm. pistol in the car. The police arrested Mr. Loffredo and two other men who were also in the car, the police said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education, Margie Feinberg, said Mr. Loffredo would be removed from the classroom and assigned to an administrative job until his case is decided.</p>
        <p>''Depending on what happens, he's likely to face disciplinary action,'' Ms. Feinberg said.</p>
        <p>The two other men in the car, Richard Orlando, 22, and his half brother Raymond Cappola, 17, both live at 184 Connecticut Street on Staten Island, the police said.</p>
