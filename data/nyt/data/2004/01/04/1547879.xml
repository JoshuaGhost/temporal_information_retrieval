        <p>Royal Caribbean Cruises announced just before the holidays that beginning in May two of its vessels, the 3,114-passenger Voyager of the Seas, one of the world's largest cruise ships, and the 2,020-passenger Nordic Empress, will dock in New Jersey rather than New York. The new port of call will be the former Bayonne Military Ocean Terminal. Nordic Empress had previously used the passenger ship terminal on Manhattan's West Side.</p>
        <p>''This is all about the Voyager,'' said Jaye Hilton, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean. ''We are going to be introducing one of our larger ships into the New York market. We needed to find a facility that could handle a ship of that size and the numbers of passengers.''</p>

        <p>Royal Caribbean Cruises announced just before the holidays that beginning in May two of its vessels, the 3,114-passenger Voyager of the Seas, one of the world's largest cruise ships, and the 2,020-passenger Nordic Empress, will dock in New Jersey rather than New York. The new port of call will be the former Bayonne Military Ocean Terminal. Nordic Empress had previously used the passenger ship terminal on Manhattan's West Side.</p>
        <p>''This is all about the Voyager,'' said Jaye Hilton, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean. ''We are going to be introducing one of our larger ships into the New York market. We needed to find a facility that could handle a ship of that size and the numbers of passengers.''</p>
        <p>The decision is a setback to New York's vigorous growth as a cruise port. In 2002, nearly 450,000 cruise passengers embarked from New York, up from 416,000 the year earlier, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. ''It is one of our fastest-growing industries,'' said Michael Sherman, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation. ''The West Side facility is at near capacity. We realize it needs improvements. It hasn't been upgraded since the 1970's.''</p>
        <p>''It's an economic blow to the city, but for most cruise vacationers, the impact will be minimal,'' said Raymond Kane, president of Pisa Brothers Travel in Manhattan, an agency that specializes in cruising. ''If you're talking about the top-end cruising where people come in and stay in luxury hotels in New York before and afterwards, the move would have a downside, but the Royal Caribbean ships are considered middle of the market.''</p>
        <p>The Bayonne facility is off the New Jersey Turnpike, about 15 minutes from Newark Liberty International Airport. Royal Caribbean is considering initiating a ferry service from Manhattan to the new port, said Ms. Hilton.</p>
