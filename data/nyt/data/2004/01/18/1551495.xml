        <p>KINZER--Hadassah D. Died at 89, on January 13, after a stroke. An active interior designer and member of the American Society of Interior Designers, she had a distinctive and unerring personal style. Her ever-present hats and cigars smoked in a holder made her memorable. Contributions in her memory to the Education Legacy Fund, 230 East 59th Street, NYC 10022, which provides scholarships to interior design students.</p>
