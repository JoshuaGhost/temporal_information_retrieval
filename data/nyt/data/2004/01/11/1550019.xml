        <p>Aside from needing a good lawyer, Mayor Samuel Rivera of Passaic may need a good family therapist. And maybe a dentist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera, a former police officer and professional wrestler, is also a parent. And the roles came crashing together when his 20-year-old married daughter, Samantha Lugo, had him arrested recently on a disorderly persons charge.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lugo told the police that her father had bitten her hand during a family dispute.</p>
        <p>Still, Maurice Elias, a professor of psychology at Rutgers who wrote ''Raising Emotionally Intelligent Teenagers,'' (Three Rivers Press: Random House, 2002), said the public should not base its judgment about his ability to govern on this incident.</p>
        <p>''The fact that this is a public official is probably irrelevant in moments like this,'' Dr. Elias said. ''The first thing you are is a parent. The most relevant information we don't have is the parenting history. So this matter may or may not be an outgrowth of how he and his daughter have related to each other.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lugo told the authorities her father bit her hand as she tried to intervene in an argument between him and his 16-year-old son. In an interview in The Record, Mr. Rivera said the dispute was over his son's friends, though he denied biting his daughter. He did, however, acknowledge that he tried to bite her to free his arm after she grabbed it.</p>
        <p>If that were not enough, the Passaic Police Department apparently failed to act on Mrs. Lugo's complaint. It was not until she took her story and what officials say was a visible bite mark on her hand to the Passaic County prosecutor three days later that Mr. Rivera was arrested by county authorities. For now, the prosecutor's office is investigating the action -- or lack of it -- by the Passaic police, and whether the mayor used his influence to avoid arrest.</p>
