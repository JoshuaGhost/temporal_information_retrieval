        <p>WICKENBURG, Ariz., has a tradition of hospitality. For most of the 20th century it drew vacationing Easterners eager to taste the romance of the West. They rode horses into the desert, where they cooked and sang and camped beneath star-pierced skies. Wickenburg, about 60 miles northwest of Phoenix and hugging low hills near the Hassayampa River, proudly advertised itself as the dude ranch capital of the world.</p>
        <p>These days the town's remoteness has a new advantage, and its hospitality has turned discreet. While vacationing city dwellers still stay at a few ranches and tourists buy Western wear in the shops or look over the spurs and lassoes at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum downtown, a large sector of the town concentrates on a new business. Wickenburg now has a reputation for treating the troubled -- especially people with addictions and eating disorders.</p>

        <p>WICKENBURG, Ariz., has a tradition of hospitality. For most of the 20th century it drew vacationing Easterners eager to taste the romance of the West. They rode horses into the desert, where they cooked and sang and camped beneath star-pierced skies. Wickenburg, about 60 miles northwest of Phoenix and hugging low hills near the Hassayampa River, proudly advertised itself as the dude ranch capital of the world.</p>
        <p>These days the town's remoteness has a new advantage, and its hospitality has turned discreet. While vacationing city dwellers still stay at a few ranches and tourists buy Western wear in the shops or look over the spurs and lassoes at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum downtown, a large sector of the town concentrates on a new business. Wickenburg now has a reputation for treating the troubled -- especially people with addictions and eating disorders.</p>
        <p>The dude ranch capital has become a Mecca of detox for thousands of grateful refugees, including some who are household names.</p>
        <p>''If you have a problem, just come to Wickenburg and wander around until you find someone to help you,'' said Ward Keller, owner of Remuda Ranch, a treatment center with its headquarters in a beautifully restored 1905 Wickenburg building that was once the Vernetta Hotel.</p>
        <p>And help you quietly. While the Wickenburg area's 10,000 residents are happy to talk, when asked, about their work, the town doesn't go out of the way to publicize its role. For people who want to deal with problems out of the public eye, the town's off-the-beaten-track location and rural low-stress atmosphere are a potent lure.</p>
        <p>While the 1,574 people treated in Wickenburg last year sounds small in comparison with the 22,000 visitors who came to its dude ranches in 2003, those figures have to be viewed in context. The average stay at a dude ranch is a week or less, at $100 to $200 a day per person. At Remuda, it's 55 days at $1,725 a day, and at the Meadows, another treatment center, it's 35 days at $1,000 a day.</p>
        <p>Wickenburg began in the 1860's as a mining and ranching town. When those industries flagged, it started inviting guests. As late as the 1970's there were still seven dude ranches with thousands of visitors a year; John Wayne and Barry Goldwater were frequent guests. But changing tastes and work habits were already steering tourists away from the sort of traditional destination vacation available at a dude ranch. Soon several guest ranches went under and were converted to private residences.</p>
        <p>Though the Meadows -- which tackles addictions, usually to drugs, alcohol or sex, as well as depression -- has been working quietly in this sleepy town since 1975, it was Mr. Keller's effort to save his young daughter, Jena, from anorexia that led, over time, to the town's radical transformation. In 1984, while he was operating a hospital services company in Phoenix, he bought Remuda Ranch, which at one time had been the town's premier dude ranch, thinking that Jena would benefit from a rustic life and wide-open spaces. In 1990 it became a residential treatment center offering a Christian-based treatment for women and girls with eating disorders. Three other treatment centers soon followed.</p>
        <p>Older and healthy, Jena Savage, Mr. Keller's daughter, is Remuda's director of marketing, and the center is now Wickenburg's largest employer and one of the largest such programs in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Meadows is Wickenburg's third-largest employer (the school district comes in second), and it has been directed for the last 26 years by Pat Mellody, a crusty and straight-talking former Air Force navigator who helped create drug and alcohol programs for military personnel during the Vietnam War. The model Elle Macpherson, A. J. McLean of the Backstreet Boys and Halle Berry's estranged husband, Eric Benet, have all stayed there, according to reports in The Daily News in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mellody, 71, would not discuss his program's participants, but he was open about himself. ''I grew up in Akron, Ohio, where Alcoholics Anonymous started,'' he said. ''My dad was one of the very early people in the program. I knew Dr. Bob and Bill W., the founders of A.A. It was just always a part of my makeup.''</p>
        <p>Situated atop a hill in the former Slash Bar K dude ranch, the Meadows has a breathtaking view of the Hassayampa River Valley and the Bradshaw Mountains.</p>
        <p>Rosewood Ranch, an eating-disorder treatment facility also founded by Mr. Mellody, is in a former bed-and-breakfast down a dusty dirt road from The Meadows. Gatehouse Academy, which treats people 17 to 25 years old who are addicted to drugs or alcohol, is in a former commercial complex in town. And eight miles north of town is Childhelp USA Merv Griffin Village, a 192-acre former tennis and dude ranch that takes in children 12 and younger who have been severely abused and removed from their families' custody.</p>
        <p>The desert's restorative power has become a New Age cliché, but the healing qualities of a desert ranch setting are a common theme in Wickenburg.</p>
        <p>''I went through the Meadows as a patient in 1989,'' Michelle Klinedinst, who is now Rosewood's director, said one day this spring. ''I saw the beauty of this desert. It brought me a feeling of serenity and centeredness; it helped me get better.''</p>
        <p>At Childhelp USA, the staff uses equine therapy. Being around horses, with their combination of power and gentleness, helps children who have endured abuse learn to love and trust.</p>
        <p>Another believer in the power of horses and the desert is Destry (following Alcoholics Anonymous protocol, he asked that his last name not be used), a former wrangler and rodeo contestant who now runs the horse program at the Gatehouse Academy. For some of the troubled young people there, he said, ''just coming to the stable and seeing the trees and the animals, they find something here.''</p>
        <p>Destry, like most of the Gatehouse staff, is in recovery himself. Sitting in the cab of his pick-up truck early one morning as a much-needed spring rain resounded on its roof and as horses neighed in stalls nearby, he nervously stroked a horsehair bauble on his key ring and looked straight ahead into the fogged windshield as he spoke of his years of rodeos and drunkenness. For him, the romance of the West, as distinct from its natural qualities, was not always a plus.</p>
        <p>''I stood on being a cowboy -- 'I'm a man, I can beat this, I don't need any help,' '' he said. ''I isolated because I thought I was different and resolved that drinking was just part of a cowboy's life. I was afraid of taking my hat off, seeing who I really am.''</p>
        <p>As the rain eased, Destry headed to town for breakfast at the Horseshoe Cafe. Popular with tourists and locals, the cafe has excellent omelets and provides a glimpse at Wickenburg's enduring character: an easy friendliness that fits its new role as a host to the troubled and yet still suits the old dude-ranch persona. In the cafe, some of the area's few remaining ranchers kept their hats on as they talked together over coffee, and the waitress, frighteningly tan, took her time and called her customers ''Sweetie'' whether she knew them or not.</p>
        <p>A few doors down the main drag, which has stores selling custom saddles, leather cellphone cases and faux Indian dream catchers, the Pony Espresso Cafe was displaying artwork by a Gatehouse resident.</p>
        <p>It doesn't hurt community relations that Wickenburg gets frequent help of various kinds from guests who have been ordered by courts far away to perform community service during their treatment. The day before Easter, for example, a group from Gatehouse helped hide 7,500 eggs for the annual Wickenburg hunt.</p>
        <p>Nancy Loftis and her husband, John, run the Kay el Bar dude ranch, where vacationers still come in search only of the mild relaxation of horseback riding, a welcoming fire and a nice cabernet. She's not dismayed by the transition of so many neighboring spreads to serving the troubled.</p>
        <p>''It's wonderful that these old dude ranches have been put to good use as treatment centers,'' she said, pushing back her stylish black cowboy hat. ''We're just glad we've been able to keep with the tradition of this wonderful place.''</p>
        <p>As a visitor sank into a thick leather couch, letting tensions dissipate, Ms. Loftis added, ''In some ways we do similar things.''</p>
        <p>Ranches for Recovery or Recreation</p>
        <p>LOOKING for horses to ride and a rural break from city life? Or a way off the road to self-destruction? Wickenburg, Ariz., has remained a destination for dude ranch vacations while also emerging as a center for treating behavioral problems like eating disorders and addictions.</p>
