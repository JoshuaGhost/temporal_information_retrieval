        <p>THERE is something sensual, yet slightly sinister, about the exotic Asian Arisaemas, or jack-in-the-pulpits, which makes our American versions seem refreshingly wholesome. I have a collection thriving in the shade of my woodland walk and couldn't help but notice that large, blooming jack-in-the pulpits were on almost every table at a recent garden trade show in Connecticut. I swear a gorgeous Arisaema sikokianum followed me home. One enthusiastic admirer, ogling the dark purple hoods of Arisaema ringens, noted, ''They're very sexy, don't you think?''</p>
        <p>That's putting it mildly. At another plant show, a plantsman told me, he saw people absent-mindedly stroking the plant's stem.</p>

        <p>THERE is something sensual, yet slightly sinister, about the exotic Asian Arisaemas, or jack-in-the-pulpits, which makes our American versions seem refreshingly wholesome. I have a collection thriving in the shade of my woodland walk and couldn't help but notice that large, blooming jack-in-the pulpits were on almost every table at a recent garden trade show in Connecticut. I swear a gorgeous Arisaema sikokianum followed me home. One enthusiastic admirer, ogling the dark purple hoods of Arisaema ringens, noted, ''They're very sexy, don't you think?''</p>
        <p>That's putting it mildly. At another plant show, a plantsman told me, he saw people absent-mindedly stroking the plant's stem.</p>
        <p>All Arisaemas share the same fascinating structure, a hooded shape called a spathe, or the ''pulpit,'' which houses an inner upright protuberance called a spadix, or ''jack.'' Although the entire package looks like a flower, the spathe is technically a leaf extension, while the spadix is the true flower, or inflorescence.</p>
        <p>I counted at least 29 Asian species of Arisaemas for sale in one catalog, from the Asiatica Nursery, almost as many in a catalog from Plant Delights Nursery, and more than 20 in Heronswood's. I want them all, even though some are too tender for my Zone 5 garden in northwest Connecticut. Almost all of these showy species hail from Japan and China. They include Arisaemas candidissimum, with stripy white veins and a pink interior, and fargesii, which has a large wine-colored pulpit and bold white stripes.</p>
        <p>Barry Yinger, owner of the Asiatica Nursery, pointed out that Chinese Arisaemas bloom a bit later than the Japanese, and thus they do well planted together. He advised planting Arisaemas among ground covers like creeping phlox or sweet woodruff. They will draw moisture away from the Arisaemas in late summer, just when their underground corms need to dry out and begin to go dormant. And there is nothing better than Arisaemas ''popping up among other perennials to stop people in their tracks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some Asian Arisaemas exhibit a long spadix that looks like the tongue of a venomous snake spitting out from under the hood. No wonder they are called Cobra Lilies. Others have perky little clublike affairs. In some, the tip of the hood extends in an elongated curve, rather like the beak of a hummingbird.</p>
        <p>The tongue of one entrancing oddity, Arisaema heterophyllum, called the Dancing Crane Cobra Lily, sticks out from under the hood and straight up in the air. Eventually, it flops down to the ground where it is thought to act as a gangplank for small insects to crawl up to pollinate the flowers inside.</p>
        <p>Tony Avent, owner of the Plant Delights Nursery, calls Arisaemas ''a sexually explicit and deviant group.'' Technically classified as monoecious, an Arisaema begins life as a male, but when robust and mature becomes female. If weakened, it can revert and become male again. In order to produce fall berries, you need pollination, which means distinct males and females growing together.</p>
        <p>Arisaemas come in different sizes, from the six-inch-high charmer Arisaema ternatipartitum to Arisaema serratum, which can soar to five feet. I have one Arisaema that delights me each spring, when it emerges as a sharp, pointed shaft, speckled with purple along its green-beige skin. It grows about a foot tall, taking on a tamer look when leaves appear, topped by a pleasant green hood. Like many Arisaemas, this one goes dormant in late summer; I have to be careful not to spear its corm when I plant my fall bulbs.</p>
        <p>Once established, Asian Arisaemas aren't fussy, thriving in light to full shade and in moist, humus-rich soil with good drainage, which is essential or the corms will rot. But with the exception of Arisaemas saxotile candidissimum and fargesii, most don't proliferate like wild jack-in-the-pulpits, which volunteer all over my garden.</p>
        <p>I used to rip them out, but now I am happy to see my natives co-habiting with their glamorous foreign cousins. I am hoping my Arisaemas live up to their erotic appearance and begin to cross-pollinate.</p>
