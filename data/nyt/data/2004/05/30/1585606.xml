        <p>ESMERALDA BETANCES' favorite book is Dr. Seuss's ''Green Eggs and Ham,'' and she is proud that she can read it. Being able to read ''Green Eggs and Ham'' might not seem like a big accomplishment for a second grader, but it is if you consider that last fall, Esmeralda could hardly read at all.</p>
        <p>She is a second grader at Public School 30 in Mott Haven in the South Bronx, a school that was the subject of Jonathan Kozol's book, ''Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope,'' published four years ago.</p>
        <p>She got her copy of ''Green Eggs and Ham'' from Richard Podolsky, whose twins are first graders at Trevor Day School, a private school whose lower grades are on the Upper East Side, which is a 20-minutes ride on the No. 6 subway line from Esmeralda's school.</p>
        <p>''She needs help desperately,'' said Mr. Podolsky, who began traveling to P.S. 30 last fall to work with Esmeralda and two other second-graders. ''It about makes me cry when I leave here and she can't remember the same word that she's seen 12 times in a chapter.''</p>
        <p>The nation just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the landmark public-school decision Brown v. Board of Education. Mr. Podolsky, however, is focused on a different educational inequity, that between public and private schools, and he sees himself as a bridge between the two.</p>
        <p>Mr. Podolsky is part of a volunteer tutoring group called Six Stops on the #6, a nod to the six stops that separate the Upper East Side from the South Bronx. He is one of about 70 parents from 11 of the city's most elite private schools who tutor at 11 of its most disadvantaged public schools. At P.S. 30, only a quarter of the students read at grade level.</p>
        <p>There is, the parents concede, an element of noblesse oblige about their efforts. Most of the volunteers are women who work in high-powered jobs, or don't have to work at all because their husbands earn enough money to afford pricey Manhattan apartments, weekend houses, elaborate vacations and $25,000-a-year private-school tuition.</p>
        <p>Is there a need for an organization whose goal is placing ''private school parents in the public schools,'' as the brochure describes the group's mission? Do private-school parents bring some unique quality to the public schools?</p>
        <p>Florence Rubenfeld, the mother of a Trevor Day fifth grader and the group's founder, argues that there is indeed a virtue to marching under a private school banner, to trumpeting the differences between the privileged and the underprivileged. Her goal is to encourage private-school parents to tear down the walls of separation. ''I think in some ways this enormous disparity is not discussed,'' said Ms. Rubenfeld, who was inspired to form the group after reading Mr. Kozol's book, in which the author admires P.S. 30's happy children and kindly teachers. ''Yes, we can be perceived as elitist, but the alternative is to be isolated.''</p>
        <p>She counts it as an achievement just to get private-school mothers to take the subway to places like the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>''Instead of being terra incognita,'' she said, ''it's become a place you can enter. You think you're going to come in and walk the streets, and they're unwalkable. If you've never entered a neighborhood like this, you think you'd be shot. What you don't know is all the wonderful kids and dedicated teachers which you never could see otherwise.''</p>
        <p>Discovering that public schools were not dirty, rundown buildings filled with unruly students and uncaring teachers was also a revelation. ''My expectation before coming here was, frankly, from some movie vision,'' said Judy Katten, a Trevor Day parent who volunteers at P.S. 30.</p>
        <p>The children seem to thirst for the attention of a caring adult. ''They're, 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, please take me,''' Ms. Katten said. When she reassured a fifth-grader that she'd be back the next week, the girl's response was, ''Oh, thank God.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rubenfeld defends P.S. 30 -- ''It's not a mediocre school,'' she insists -- but would she and the other private-school parents send their own children there? Basically, said a trio of parents speaking for the group the other day, the answer is no. It would be hard to give up their nice gyms and small class sizes, they said, and everyone knows that public schools are underfunded.</p>
        <p>As the three volunteers talked in the school library, Leonora Arroyo, the assistant principal, listened with a smile on her face.</p>
        <p>''We had a student admitted to Horace Mann,'' she told the visiting parents gently. ''You can put the brightest kid in any school, and if they are self-motivated, they can do anything.'' The children at P.S. 30 may be separate, she seemed to be saying, but perhaps they are not so unequal, after all.</p>
