        <p>GUSSMAN--Lawrence. Larry, you were a great Jewish philanthropist and humanitarian.

We consider it an honor and privilege to have called you our dear, close friend. The Sarita Gantz Family</p>

        <p>GUSSMAN--Lawrence. The Heyman and Adelson families mourn their uncle and great-great-uncle. A wonderful man, he possessed great insight, a wry sense of humor and a compassion for all.
