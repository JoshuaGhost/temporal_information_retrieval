        <p>The Shelter Island school board's offer to drop criminal charges against the woman who photographed the school's padded timeout room if she, in turn, dropped her lawsuit against the board has become a moot point.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent last month to one of the woman's lawyers, the Suffolk County district attorney, Thomas Spota, agreed to dismiss the charges outright.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spota wrote that he was disturbed that school officials suggested they could affect the outcome of a criminal case in exchange for a favorable outcome in a civil case. Instead, he said he would seek to dismiss the charge against the woman, Susan Williams.</p>
        <p>Last June, Ms. Williams, whose daughter was then in kindergarten, said she went into the school to document the existence of the padded room.</p>
        <p>The school superintendent, Kenneth Lanier, asked her to leave, then called the police after she returned. Ms. Williams, who was charged with trespassing, is now suing the school district, the Shelter Island police, the district attorney's office and Mr. Lanier.</p>
        <p>Kevin Seaman, the school district's lawyer, said he was surprised to hear the district attorney's office was dropping the case because he understood that prosecutors were eager to pursue it.</p>
        <p>''The district had only good intentions,'' he said. ''We wanted to settle the matter and move forward.''</p>
