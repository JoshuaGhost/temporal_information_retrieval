        <p>WHEN I drive down the rural roads near my house in northwestern Connecticut, I cannot help but keep my eyes open to what is happening in the surrounding woods (and in other people's gardens). And with all of the talk lately about the demise of Canadian hemlocks, I am constantly assessing the health of these beloved trees. It is deceptive to think that they are fine just because one still sees them along the roadside.</p>
        <p>Their enemy is the wooly adelgid (AH-dell-jid), a tiny insect that poisons hemlocks while feeding on their needles. The infestation is long and protracted -- a thinning of the needles, a period of regrowth and then, most often, a slow decline, taking more than 10 years to reach its sad conclusion.</p>

        <p>WHEN I drive down the rural roads near my house in northwestern Connecticut, I cannot help but keep my eyes open to what is happening in the surrounding woods (and in other people's gardens). And with all of the talk lately about the demise of Canadian hemlocks, I am constantly assessing the health of these beloved trees. It is deceptive to think that they are fine just because one still sees them along the roadside.</p>
        <p>Their enemy is the wooly adelgid (AH-dell-jid), a tiny insect that poisons hemlocks while feeding on their needles. The infestation is long and protracted -- a thinning of the needles, a period of regrowth and then, most often, a slow decline, taking more than 10 years to reach its sad conclusion.</p>
        <p>Michael Montgomery, a research entomologist for the United States Forest Service at the Center for Forest Health Research in Hamden, Conn., explains that, unlike most pests and diseases, the wooly adelgid thrives on healthy trees, not weak ones. Botanists have given this unusual syndrome a fittingly unwieldy name: negative density dependent feedback.</p>
        <p>The Canadian hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, is an important element of the Northeastern landscape -- not only aesthetically because of its drooping, densely needled branches -- but also for its role in providing shelter and sustenance for a variety of wildlife. After emigrating from Asia to the West Coast in the 1920's, the adelgid made its way east, decimating trees from Maine to North Carolina. Right now the only solutions are to spray pesticides or horticultural oil, hardly an option for an area as large as the Adirondacks, let alone the East Coast.</p>
        <p>One really can't help but question what will be the end result of this loss to our local landscape. And last fall, at a meeting of horticulturists in New York, I was given some surprising answers by Peter del Tredici, a senior research scientist at the Arnold Arboretum (Harvard's botanical garden). While expounding on nature's complicated relationship with the garden, Mr. del Tredici examined how nature confounds us with its unpredictable moves forward. Forecasts typically envision the hemlock's demise and replacement by similar trees, a conifer for a conifer, so to speak. So I assumed he would describe the spread of native white pine. But Mr. del Tredici pointed to a different turn of events. As hemlocks recede, the black birch and a variety of other deciduous trees are beginning to make their appearance, often accounting for more than 90 percent of the woody stock replacing the Canadian hemlock in the landscape.</p>
        <p>Of course, nature takes its course and in the words of Mr. del Tredici: ''Forests are always in flux. I would be the last person to predict where it's going to lead. The wildlife composition may change, but, then again, it may not make a difference.''</p>
        <p>As a bird lover, I felt reassured, except for the fact that I could not imagine New England without its Canadian hemlocks. And beyond that, I am a gardener. What about the role of the hemlock in our gardens?</p>
        <p>Just driving up the road from my house to the village store, I must see more than 45 specimens planted out in neighboring yards, some of them just within the last year. I couldn't imagine black birch replacing my neighbor's front hedge, and yet I couldn't imagine my neighbor thoroughly spraying his trees with horticultural oil at the right moment in the season. And I didn't want to imagine the use of pesticides to keep the pests away; streams and waterways are as much a part of the Connecticut landscape as the hemlocks, and I drink the water. Beyond that, the pesticides that ward off wooly adelgid leave the trees susceptible to mites, in essence replacing one pest with another.</p>
        <p>So if nature was choosing black birch, what would I select instead?</p>
        <p>I knew that I preferred to stay within the same genus, but Tsuga caroliniana, the Carolina hemlock, is also suffering from adelgid attack, and besides it lacks the dropping grace and fullness of its Northern cousin. The western hemlock lacks the hardiness demanded in the east.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Chinese hemlock, Tsuga chinensis, is actually proving itself resistant to the wooly adelgid. And Susan Bentz, a horticulturist with the National Arboretum in Washington, has been hard at work for 10 years trying to create Chino-American hybrids, with some success crossing the Carolina hemlock and its Chinese relative. But thus far the Canadian hemlock seems unwilling to make a cross.</p>
        <p>The work continues. This sort of tree research, of course, requires heroes with great patience, and any cultivars would take years to enter the market -- not the answer a gardener in spring wants to hear.</p>
        <p>I was left with the option of the Chinese hemlock in its straight species form. And when Mr. Montgomery sent me photographs of some mature specimens in their native habitat, I was taken by their upswept flat-topped form, reminiscent of the umbrella pines around Rome.</p>
        <p>While the Chinese hemlock's resemblance to the Canadian hemlock is marginal, I found that, perhaps like nature, I, too, am able to prove adaptable. And when I managed to find Tsuga chinensis in the Heronswood Nursery catalog (www.heronswood.com or 360-297-4172), I decided to order Chinese. I guess nature influences all gardeners in unexpected ways.</p>
