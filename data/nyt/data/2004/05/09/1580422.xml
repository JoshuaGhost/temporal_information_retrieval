        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Couple Who Saved Park Slope'' (Coping, April 25), about the efforts of Evelyn and Everett Ortner to attract new residents to brownstone Brooklyn: Like many tourists, I was largely unaware of the borough's allure. But I got the opportunity to experience Brooklyn with Don Moore, the former president of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to him and his wife, Sue, I saw a part of New York filled with real neighborhoods that were discovering themselves anew.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Couple Who Saved Park Slope'' (Coping, April 25), about the efforts of Evelyn and Everett Ortner to attract new residents to brownstone Brooklyn: Like many tourists, I was largely unaware of the borough's allure. But I got the opportunity to experience Brooklyn with Don Moore, the former president of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. Thanks to him and his wife, Sue, I saw a part of New York filled with real neighborhoods that were discovering themselves anew.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore had arranged for Evelyn Ortner, a docent of the Brooklyn Museum, to give our group a special tour, and thanks to her skills, I will never again view Egyptian statuary the same. But the best part of the experience was accompanying Mrs. Ortner back to the Park Slope brownstone she has shared with her husband for more than 40 years. It was like a living museum -- beautiful, engaging, inspiring and filled with life.</p>
        <p>As a result, I have become a loyal fan of Brooklyn as a tourist destination and a place to live.</p>
        <p>NANCY R. LANEY  Director, Tucson Botanical Gardens</p>
