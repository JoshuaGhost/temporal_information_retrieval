      <block class="full_text">
        <p>As you might expect, the high society dress-up costumes are showy and elegant, especially the hats. The music rings a bell. And the lyrics seem familiar, even if you can't quite remember them without a cue:</p>
        <p>Every duke and earl and peer is here.</p>
        <p>Everyone who should be here is here.</p>
        <p>The scene is the ''Ascot Gavotte,'' the spectacle of gorgeosity from that musical of musicals from 1956, ''My Fair Lady.'' It's the scene known for setting a breathtaking standard of extravagance on the stage that was only amplified in the 1964 screen version, and for inflating a huge balloon of pomposity that is gloriously punctured by the musical theater's most beloved societal interloper, Eliza Doolittle. You remember her ill-mannered exhortation of the nag Dover: ''Move yer bloomin' arse!''</p>
        <p>Here at the McCarter Theater Center, however, the new jewel-box second stage, the Berlind Theater, makes little of this possible. The stage measures only a few hoop skirts wide, it seems, hardly enough for a fashion parade, much less any kind of dance, an orchestra or a chorus.</p>
        <p>The ''My Fair Lady'' that opened here on Wednesday is likely to dash the expectations of anyone seeking the efflorescent pomp of the original or any of the show's myriad restagings. The imaginative product of two affable and boyish Chicagoans, the stage director Gary Griffin and the musical director Thomas Murray, this is ''My Fair Lady'' in miniature. They haven't cut any scenes or songs; virtually all of the original dialogue remains in place. But performed on an essentially bare stage, without a choreographer or a chorus, with a cast of a mere 10 and two pianos sitting in for an orchestra, the show bears more resemblance to its archly satiric source material (Shaw's ''Pygmalion,'' if you must be reminded) than to the luscious, clever musical written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe and initially directed with the juiciest panache by Moss Hart.</p>
        <p>The natural question is, why? Why strip a beloved musical of the very thing that makes it beloved? For Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray, the better question is, why not? Why not see what else is hidden in the folds of a great work of art?</p>
        <p>''It's like any great play, any classic,'' said Mr. Griffin, 43. ''It's there for re-examining, as long as you treat it with respect.''</p>
        <p>The re-examination, in this case, has to do with analyzing the story ''My Fair Lady'' tells, identifying its essentials and re-envisioning the musical. That is, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray did not shrink ''My Fair Lady'' from its accepted size; they built it from scratch on a different scale.</p>
        <p>''I like to work on music theater the way you work on a great play,'' said Mr. Griffin, a veteran director around Chicago who is probably best known to New York theatergoers for the concert versions of ''Pardon My English'' in March and ''The New Moon,'' presented last year, in the Encores! series at City Center. ''Sometimes music theater relies on clich√© or spectacle to pump up a moment and create an emotion we know how to respond to. And what Tom and I like to work on is not trying to develop the music theater moment, but trying to figure out the truthful event that's going on with the characters that the music can shape and reflect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray, 37, added that in a musical like ''My Fair Lady,'' there is a great deal to discover. You can go through the show, he said, and see where the creators added sweep and spectacle to the foundation.</p>
        <p>''But it's not as if, in the writing, Lerner said to himself, 'Well, this is a big moment so I can write fluff lyrics,' '' Mr. Murray said. ''So when we decided we were going to look at some of the big scenes, we found a lot already there for us to use.''</p>
        <p>Variations on the Familiar</p>
        <p>The Ascot scene is a case in point. In Mr. Griffin's staging there is no procession; instead, 9 of the show's 10 actors enter and exit in different groupings. (Michael McCarty, who plays Alfred P. Doolittle, Eliza's good-for-nothing charmer of a father, is the absentee.) And the scene becomes a series of brief glimpses into developing relationships.</p>
        <p>With no chorus, the lyrics have been parceled out to different characters so that each sung line functions as a line of dialogue. The sweet-tempered feckless young swain, Freddy Eynsford-Hill (Jim Stanek), begins falling for Eliza (Kate Fry). The linguistics professor Henry Higgins (Michael Cumpsty) reacts with smug reserve and ill-concealed glee as his experiment in behavioral control has its first public airing. His friend, Colonel Pickering (Simon Jones), becomes overwrought with excitement and concern.</p>
        <p>And Henry's mother (Jane Connell), whose box everyone eventually gathers in, grows more and more irritated at her son for bringing a mere flower girl to an important social event and turning what was supposed to be a pleasant and relaxing day at the races into a trial. In conventional stagings, when the chorus sings, the lyrics ''Pulses rushing! Faces flushing! Heartbeats speed up'' refer to anticipation of the race that is about to begin.</p>
        <p>But here, everyone in the box is not only waiting for the race to begin but also feeling uptight socially in some way. And when Mrs. Higgins finishes the verse, singing, ''I have never been so keyed up!,'' there is a moment of comedy and character revelation. It isn't flashy, but it's a new and theatrically rewarding twist on a familiar scene.</p>
        <p>''What is Ascot?'' Mr. Griffin said. ''It's a scene with a famous visual stroke that you can't do at all on this scale. But our thing is not just to make something smaller. It's about what would be fun about the piece if we didn't have the history of it?''</p>
        <p>Reducing the size of a musical makes it more manageable physically and economically, of course, and allows it to be seen in theaters where it would otherwise be impossible. In the 360-seat Berlind, the McCarter is mounting ''My Fair Lady'' for $600,000, a pittance compared with what a full-blown extravaganza might cost. (In July it will be in the modest-size auditorium of the Hartford Stage.) You can almost hear the sniffing sounds of hungry commercial producers who are hoping the show satisfies an audience as well as it does a pocketbook.</p>
        <p>Boiling Down to the Essence</p>
        <p>Its other potential advantages are a little subtler, and those are the ones Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray have concentrated on. Mainly that what you don't get in a big musical in a big auditorium is a sense of intimacy with the characters or a nuanced view of their relationships, so the two men inverted what Lerner, Loewe and Hart did.</p>
        <p>Instead of building around the scenes of posh extravagance, grandeur and musical frivolity -- that is, Ascot, the ball and Alfie Doolittle's Covent Garden frolics, ''With a Little Bit of Luck'' and ''Get Me to the Church on Time'' -- and linking them with the book scenes and smaller songs set in Henry's study, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray did the opposite. Their version is built around the study scenes, which they honed to a polish, with Ascot and the other big numbers refocused on the characters within them. It is an approach that the actors have felt keenly, making them think about making the music and the dialogue feed on each other.</p>
        <p>''In rehearsal Gary always has both scripts with him, 'Pygmalion' and 'My Fair Lady,' '' Ms. Fry said. ''He's always going back to them. Clearly, or at least it seems to me, his top priority is to be completely true to the richness of the text. So one of the goals is not to make the songs five-minute diversions from the text, but extensions of scenes. And that doesn't only inform how you sing, but how you play the scene, because in order to rationalize any kind of song you have to be in some sort of heightened emotional state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cumpsty, who is not known as a musical-theater actor but who recently appeared nonetheless in ''42nd Street'' on Broadway, said he didn't at all miss the spectacle.</p>
        <p>''I had all the sequins and bugle beads I needed on Broadway,'' he said. ''But having done mostly dramas, I would say that Gary, as an actor's director, is one of the most skilled I've ever worked with. He gives you a lot of space and then comes in and just nudges you in terms of action or intention or whatever. And to be doing a musical with someone who is so extremely precise about the text is fascinating.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Jones, though the colonel in this production, played Henry in a fully inflated version of ''My Fair Lady'' at the Paper Mill Playhouse a dozen years ago, and said that making the show smaller made the actors bigger.</p>
        <p>''What's interesting is that when you get rid of the chorus, you remove a whole row of yes men,'' he said. ''So you have to justify yourself to the audience. You can say any old rubbish to a chorus and they've been trained to nod their heads, whether or not you're making any sense at all. But in this show you've really got to put it across.''</p>
        <p>One result of all this is that in the end, unlike most versions of ''My Fair Lady,'' which lean toward satisfying romantic closure, this one leaves it uncertain how Henry and Eliza resolve their feelings for each other. Anything might happen after the curtain; she might even decide to marry Freddy. This really is closer to the ending for ''Pygmalion,'' though Shaw was adamant that Eliza and Henry would never end up together.</p>
        <p>''The idea,'' Mr. Murray said, looking as though he were mentally crossing his fingers, ''is that instead of being a sheer emotional high, it has a dramatic entertainment value as well.''</p>
        <p>Wandering Into a Career</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin, who was born in St. Louis and grew up in Rockford, Ill., wanted to be in journalism, which is what he began studying at the University at Wisconsin-Eau Claire, ''wandering into the theater,'' he said, and beginning to direct after he saw the work of the emerging Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago in the late 1970's. Learning that some members of that troupe had gone to Illinois State University, he enrolled there for graduate school, and eventually returned to Chicago to begin his career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray nearly vanished into technology. He grew up in El Paso, Tex., and traveled north for college, to Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., where his double major was music and computer science. He considered going into opera as a vocal coach, then gave up music for a while and worked as an artificial-intelligence programmer, though finally it didn't take and, as he put it, ''I migrated back.''</p>
        <p>The two met when Mr. Griffin had just taken over as the artistic director of the Drury Lane Theater in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., and Mr. Murray was called in as an emergency replacement for a music director who had quit. That was in 1994, and they've been staging musicals together since.</p>
        <p>They don't like to think of themselves as miniaturists, which in any case would not be entirely accurate. At the Drury Lane they presented largely standard stagings of traditional musicals like ''West Side Story'' and ''City of Angels.'' Among many other projects, they staged, in 1999, with the help of Stephen Sondheim, the first production of Mr. Sondheim's early musical ''Saturday Night,'' with the Pegasus Players, a small Chicago troupe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin (whose ''New Moon'' had a total of 46 singers and dancers onstage) will direct a new musical based on the Alice Walker novel ''The Color Purple,'' at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta this fall. In addition to other larger works, Mr. Murray was the musical director for the national tour of ''Parade.''</p>
        <p>But like sculptors whose hobby is building intricate model ships and bottling them, these men have developed a subspecialty of making musicals small. They collaborated on two Sondheim musicals, ''Pacific Overtures'' and ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' which were presented at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, each production carving its peculiar performance space out of a tiny top-floor auditorium. Originally, those shows were elaborately presented in proscenium theaters. But Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray staged ''Pacific Overtures,'' about the opening of Japan to the West, on a square wooden platform surrounded by the audience.</p>
        <p>''We liked the idea of the stage as a floating island,'' Mr. Griffin said.</p>
        <p>Even more daringly, ''Sunday,'' partly about the creation of a painting by Georges Seurat, and hence about perspective, was presented in its entirety on a slender runway with the audience on either side.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it was just mischievous on our part,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''But Tom and I asked ourselves: 'Does that show really have to have a proscenium? Could it be you could tell that story if you didn't have the backdrop? Is there a way that perspective has a larger meaning than what the play says it means?' ''</p>
        <p>Both men say their strength is in how closely they work together, and you can see it in the rehearsal room. They check with each other constantly, often with just a nod or a gesture agreeing to adjust a dramatic beat or a musical phrase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray speaks about how watching Mr. Griffin work with actors on a script has helped him in coaching singers, and has allowed him to see that in a well-conceived and well-written musical, when the actor has nailed the character, the character will more easily find the musicality in the songs.</p>
        <p>''In giving the actors something to act and play through the songs, he's doing my job for me in a way,'' Mr. Murray said, ''because often the voice will respond to that kind of direction.''</p>
        <p>An Earlier 'Lady'</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin, for his part, says he considers lyrics to be lines of dialogue and melodic phrasing to be elements of character. ''Our interest over the years has been to make music, book and lyric seamless,'' he said. ''They're not departmentalized in how we think about the show, or how we speak about the show.''</p>
        <p>It helps, Mr. Murray said, that they have done so many shows together. And it helps even more, he said, that this is their second pass at ''My Fair Lady.'' Two years ago they staged it at the Court Theater, a professional company affiliated with the University of Chicago. That production evolved from an unsatisfying but instructive workshop of the show that had only five characters: Eliza, Freddy, Henry, Pickering and Alfie. (The two-piano orchestration was done in the 1950's by Trude Rittman, who was best known as a choreographer but who was asked by Loewe to make the arrangement. If it hadn't existed, Mr. Murray said, he would have done his own arrangement, ''with piano, bass, harp and woodwind or cello or something.'')</p>
        <p>For the current production, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Murray have made slight text changes, reinstating a character (Mrs. Hopkins, a friend of Alfie) though not adding an actor. (Brenda Martindale, who plays Freddy's mother, doubles in the part.) The set has also been modified slightly to accommodate the Berlind, which is a bit larger than the Court. The set has two tiers, an upstairs platform with a balustrade, connected to the stage floor by a spiral staircase.</p>
        <p>But the biggest difference is in the cast. Only Ms. Fry, as Eliza, is repeating her role.</p>
        <p>''To be honest, it was a little daunting at first,'' Mr. Griffin said of taking on a work that is such a favorite and so keenly stamped on the public mind. ''People have so many expectations of this show. What I hope happens, and what Tom and I talk about a lot, is that even though you know you're not going to see the production values -- you walk into the theater and see the stage and the set and you know that's not going to happen -- what might be wonderful is that you'll discover more about the cleverness of the book and how smart the lyric writing is.''</p>
