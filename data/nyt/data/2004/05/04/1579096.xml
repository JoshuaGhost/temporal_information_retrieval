        <p>New York State Governor George E Pataki will decide whether to build new tunnel or use tunnel on M, N and R subway lines to put rail link from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy Airport and Long Island (M)</p>

        <p>Searching for a rail link from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy Airport and Long Island, the Pataki administration is poised to choose between building a new tunnel or using the existing Montague Street tunnel on the M, N and R subway lines.</p>
        <p>The cost of a Long Island-Lower Manhattan link using the Montague Street tunnel has been put by officials and business executives at $5 billion to $5.5 billion. A new tunnel might add $1 billion to the cost.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki may declare the choice tomorrow in his semiannual progress report on downtown reconstruction. In these speeches, he typically lists recent accomplishments, makes several announcements and sets timetables for pending projects.</p>
        <p>Often, such matters are in flux until the last minute, so the reluctance of state officials to discuss the rail link yesterday could reflect either genuine indecision or their concern about pre-empting the governor.</p>
        <p>All that Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for the governor, would say was that Mr. Pataki will ''announce new initiatives that will help revitalize downtown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki may simply disclose the winnowing of choices for an East River crossing to bring trains into Lower Manhattan from Long Island, through Jamaica in Queens and Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn. Using a new tunnel or the Montague Street tunnel would eliminate the idea, central to two alternatives, of sharing the Cranberry Street Tunnel on the A and C lines.</p>
        <p>Four plans have been under study since February by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city Economic Development Corporation. They had said they would announce their choice and a financing plan by the end of last month.</p>
        <p>The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who represents much of Lower Manhattan, does not know which tunnel idea is favored, said a spokeswoman, Eileen Larrabee. But she added he had been pushing the governor, a Republican, for such a link to Long Island, ''knowing it will be a real boost to rebuilding efforts.''</p>
        <p>Gene Russianoff, staff attorney of the New York Public Interest Research Group Straphangers Campaign, said, ''It looks like the governor is leaning toward building a new under-river tunnel, but would not rule out using the existing tunnel.'' He said his group questioned the cost and benefit of a new tunnel, and opposed using the Montague Street tunnel because it would compromise subway service.</p>
