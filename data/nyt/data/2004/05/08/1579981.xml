        <p>The Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, struggling with operational and financial problems, said yesterday that it had to lose money in the first quarter to make money in future quarters.</p>
        <p>Interpublic, the world's third-largest agency company in revenue after the Omnicom Group and the WPP Group, reported a bigger first-quarter loss both compared with last year and with what analysts had expected. The net loss of $16.9 million, or 5 cents a share, was up from a net loss of $8.6 million, or 2 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Analysts had expected a net loss of 1 cent a share.</p>
        <p>Interpublic executives, in a conference call, attributed the wider net loss to additional spending and charges to reorganize their businesses as part of ambitious turnaround plans that they forecast would take two to three years to achieve. Interpublic has been laying off employees, selling noncore agencies and reducing expenses after not recording a profit since 2002 in the wake of difficulties that include accounting irregularities and losses at a motor-sports division.</p>
        <p>''We have moved more aggressively in certain of our restructuring actions,'' said Christopher J. Coughlin, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, and as a result ''the restructuring program is now essentially complete.'' The total expense for reorganizing Interpublic, previously estimated at $250 million, will be about $270 million, he added.</p>
        <p>''From actions taken to date, we expect $200 million in gross annualized savings'' from the reorganization, Mr. Coughlin said, compared with previous estimates for $150 million to $170 million a year in savings. Interpublic took a pretax charge of $62.6 million for the reorganization, for items like severance, and impairment charges of $8.8 million related to steps like writing down a small marketing consultancy that may be sold.</p>
        <p>Revenue in the quarter rose 6 percent, to $1.4 billion from $1.32 billion in the quarter in 2003. Shares of Interpublic fell 19 cents, to $15.35 yesterday.</p>
