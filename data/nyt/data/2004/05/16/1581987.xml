        <p>PLANS for an office, retail and residential development on 92 of the 370 acres of the old Kings Park Psychiatric Center were unveiled at a public hearing last week, generating a mixed reaction from some residents.</p>
        <p>''Clearly we need something done with the property that will be useful for the community,'' said Stuart Mayrick, a Kings Park resident who attended the hearing Tuesday night. ''But creating a new community with residences plus businesses would add more traffic to Route 25A, which is already a bottleneck. It would make it impossible to travel in the town.''</p>

        <p>PLANS for an office, retail and residential development on 92 of the 370 acres of the old Kings Park Psychiatric Center were unveiled at a public hearing last week, generating a mixed reaction from some residents.</p>
        <p>''Clearly we need something done with the property that will be useful for the community,'' said Stuart Mayrick, a Kings Park resident who attended the hearing Tuesday night. ''But creating a new community with residences plus businesses would add more traffic to Route 25A, which is already a bottleneck. It would make it impossible to travel in the town.''</p>
        <p>Another resident, Joan Bentancourt -- who like Mr. Mayrick also lives about a mile away -- said she feared that if traffic backs up on Route 25A, drivers would gravitate to residential streets. ''My block is already too busy during certain times of the day,'' she said by phone on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>But another resident, Edith Pelka, said Wednesday that she ''can't wait to get on the waiting list to buy into this development.''</p>
        <p>''It sounds very, very nice, and it's a good thing for Kings Park because we have been waiting a long time for this property to be developed,'' she said. ''It's been a brown field with abandoned buildings, and we certainly don't want factories. This is a beautiful thing. It is going to be a godsend for the area.''</p>
        <p>James Buslik, a managing member of the development company, LAMB Acquisitions of Kings Park, said that plans call for 23,800 square feet of retail space, 288,000 square feet of office space and 2,000 residential units, 20 percent of which would be for older residents.</p>
        <p>The development would be bounded by Route 25A on the south, Lawrence Road on the east, Church Street on the west and St. Johnland Road on the north.</p>
        <p>''It is a comprehensive plan taking into account the needs of the community to be revenue-positive for the school district and tying into the existing downtown that is in need of economic stimulus,'' Mr. Buslik said.</p>
        <p>He noted that the developers had elicited comments from community groups and residents. Eric Alexander, the director of Vision Long Island, which helped to coordinate the meetings, said 3,000 people attended the sessions.</p>
        <p>''We compressed what would be a year's worth of planning into eight days, taking feedback from the community after each session and revising the plan based on what we heard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Patrick Vecchio, Smithtown's supervisor, said he was not impressed, calling the plan a ''pie in the sky'' idea. ''It's overblown, overexaggerated and overwhelming,'' he said, adding that the plan must be approved by both the Smithtown Planning Board and the Town Board when it is submitted next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vecchio said the proposal would be subject to a lengthy environmental review process and that it could be many years before the project is started.</p>
        <p>Desmond Ryan, the executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group, said that LAMB Acquisitions bought the property last year with a winning bid of $7.5 million. He said it would cost $50 million more to demolish the remaining buildings at the psychiatric center, which was closed in 1996, and to clean up the site.</p>
        <p>''Someone will develop that area,'' he said, ''and the object is to have responsible developers who are willing to work with the community.''</p>
