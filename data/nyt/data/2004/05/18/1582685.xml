        <p>A lawsuit that sought to stop the Metropolitan Museum of Art from its long-planned expansion was dismissed yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit pitted the museum against a group of wealthy neighbors known as the Metropolitan Museum Historic District Coalition, which says it fears that the Met expansion will draw more visitors to the museum and add to the taxis, school buses and carnival of performers along Fifth Avenue. The museum contends that the number of visitors, currently about five million a year, will remain unchanged. According to the Met, the museum's exterior will not be expanded, but the amount of available space inside will grow. The group argued that a 1971 agreement with the city restricted the museum's ability to expand. A lawyer for the group said it planned to appeal the suit's dismissal. Judge Marcy S. Friedman ruled, among other things, that the relief the group sought, including an environmental review, was moot because the statute of limitations had lapsed.</p>
