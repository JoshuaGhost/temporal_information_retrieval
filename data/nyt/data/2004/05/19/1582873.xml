        <p>After revelations about an assemblyman's encounter with a female intern, the Assembly on Tuesday adopted rules to better protect interns from lawmakers who abuse their power.</p>

        <p>In the wake of revelations about an assemblyman's late-night encounter with a young female intern, the Assembly on Tuesday adopted rules intended to better protect interns from lawmakers who abuse their power.</p>
        <p>The changes include a ban on fraternization between interns and lawmakers and, except for existing relationships, between interns and Assembly staff members. And the Assembly's sexual harassment policy will be amended to encourage interns to report complaints promptly.</p>
        <p>But no changes to the internship program's leadership were recommended or adopted. One of the two co-chairmen is Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic Party leader, who was indicted last year on criminal charges of trying to strong-arm judicial candidates into hiring consultants favored by the party.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a government watchdog group raised questions about Mr. Norman's leadership role.</p>
        <p>Rachel Leon, the executive director of the group, Common Cause New York, said the fact that a legislator accused of misusing his power oversees the intern program underlined the importance of reform.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that they might want to be looking at a woman,'' Ms. Leon said, laughing, of the Assembly's efforts to overhaul the program. ''How about that for a new beginning?''</p>
        <p>Turning serious, she added: ''I would think that right now they would be looking far and wide to really find someone who is just a complete ethics role model. I mean, he is innocent until proven guilty, but they might want to really look for the best they could find.''</p>
        <p>Outside the Assembly chamber on Tuesday before the changes were announced, Mr. Norman declined to discuss the topic in depth.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Ron Canestrari, a Democrat from Cohoes who is the program's other co-chairman, had pushed for the ban on fraternization.</p>
        <p>The Assembly review was prompted by a police investigation of a May 4 encounter between Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV and a 19-year-old female intern in a motel. The woman told investigators that Mr. Powell, 42, a Democrat from East Harlem, gave her Scotch to drink. No charges have been filed, but the investigation is continuing.</p>
        <p>Under the new rules, interns will no longer be allowed to attend legislative receptions where alcohol is served. The changes were announced just as a fund-raiser was getting under way for Assemblyman Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn Democrat who pleaded guilty to petty larceny in February for accepting reimbursement for trips he had not paid for.</p>
