        <p>Citing the security of 7 million daily riders, 48,000 employees and its transportation network, New York City Transit yesterday proposed a ban on unauthorized photography, filming and videotaping on city subways, buses and Staten Island Railway trains. The press and businesses or individuals with permits would be exempt.</p>
        <p>Transit officials also proposed a tougher rule against turnstile jumping, banning it even if a miscreant has a fare card and acts out of frustration when the card or a turnstile malfunctions, and they suggested new rules against walking between subway cars, putting feet on seats and misusing student or senior reduced-fare cards.</p>

        <p>Citing the security of 7 million daily riders, 48,000 employees and its transportation network, New York City Transit yesterday proposed a ban on unauthorized photography, filming and videotaping on city subways, buses and Staten Island Railway trains. The press and businesses or individuals with permits would be exempt.</p>
        <p>Transit officials also proposed a tougher rule against turnstile jumping, banning it even if a miscreant has a fare card and acts out of frustration when the card or a turnstile malfunctions, and they suggested new rules against walking between subway cars, putting feet on seats and misusing student or senior reduced-fare cards.</p>
        <p>If approved by New York City Transit's parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, next fall after a public-comment period, the changes would become the system's first new rules of conduct in a decade, joining prohibitions against graffiti, littering, spitting, smoking, panhandling, loud radio playing, drinking alcoholic beverages and going onto subway tracks or into tunnels or other unauthorized areas.</p>
        <p>''The world we live in has changed dramatically since 1994, so has our operating environment,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit. ''These changes to our rules of conduct are intended to enhance security and safety, not only for our customers but our employees as well.''</p>
        <p>The proposed ban on photography, filming and videotaping drew immediate objections from the New York Public Interest Research Group Straphangers Campaign. ''We think it's a mistake to turn the subways into a scary underground where you can't take pictures,'' said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer. ''We respect the need for security in the transit system but believe that there are important values in having photographers document life and conditions on the subways and buses.''</p>
        <p>He noted that the M.T.A. was sponsoring an exhibition at Grand Central Terminal of photos taken over decades of life in the subways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russianoff said the proposed ban on picture-taking could raise First Amendment issues as well. While members of the press with identity cards issued by the police would be exempt, other people and businesses would need written permission. ''No standards are detailed in the proposed rules for issuing such authorizations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Charles F. Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit, brushed aside such objections. He said any person or commercial enterprise with legitimate needs, including film and television producers, advertisers, artists and others, ''would all be allowed'' to take pictures as long as they obtained written permission in advance.</p>
        <p>While transit officers would make common-sense judgments about issuing summonses to tourists who take pictures without knowing the rules, even visitors would be subject to fines, Mr. Seaton said, although there is no provision for confiscation of cameras. He said taking a picture or filming without authorization would be subject to a relatively low $25 fine.</p>
        <p>Spitting, smoking and littering carry a $50 fine, he said, while vandalism and other more serious offenses are subject to penalties of $100 or more.</p>
        <p>The rules of conduct on the transit system are as old as the subways, which mark their centennial this year. Officials acknowledge that enforcement has always been something of a problem, with a few thousand officers responsible for 468 stations, 660 miles of track and a vast network of bus routes. The use of cellphone and other miniature cameras may also complicate enforcement of a photography ban.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Seaton noted that this would not be the first ban on filming and picture-taking in the city subways. One was imposed in the early 1930's, he said, for reasons that are no longer clear, and was in force until 1994, when transit officials decided to relax it after embarrassing news reports that a woman had been given a summons for taking a picture on a subway in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the bombing that killed hundreds on a commuter train in Madrid earlier this year, tighter security has been a high priority, Mr. Seaton said. The other proposed rule changes are also needed, he said.</p>
        <p>After the proposed rules are published in the New York State Register early next month, a 45-day period of public comment would ensue. Modifications might then be offered. Finally, New York City Transit would seek final approval by the board of the M.T.A. The board does not meet in August, but would probably consider the rules in September or October.</p>
