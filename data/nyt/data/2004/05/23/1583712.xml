        <p>NATHAN LANE and Matthew Broderick were reported to be making $100,000 a week during their recent return stint in ''The Producers.'' But what about the guy playing Dancing Hitler No. 3? That question is the concern of Actors' Equity Association, the union that is celebrating its 90th season of fighting for better salaries, benefits and working conditions for theater performers and stage managers throughout the country.</p>
        <p>This season, the minimum salary for a Broadway performer is $1,354 a week, a figure dictated by the contract between the union and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association for the commercial theater industry.

        <p>NATHAN LANE and Matthew Broderick were reported to be making $100,000 a week during their recent return stint in ''The Producers.'' But what about the guy playing Dancing Hitler No. 3? That question is the concern of Actors' Equity Association, the union that is celebrating its 90th season of fighting for better salaries, benefits and working conditions for theater performers and stage managers throughout the country.</p>
        <p>This season, the minimum salary for a Broadway performer is $1,354 a week, a figure dictated by the contract between the union and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association for the commercial theater industry. The current four-year contract expires on June 27. The two organizations are negotiating a new one that could last until June 2008.</p>
        <p>The typical Broadway chorus member is guaranteed $1,354 a week, but performers who have larger roles receive more. For example, the minimum goes up $20 for a chorus member with a small speaking part. If a performer is also an understudy for a lead role, there is a $33 increment. Stars, of course, have the leverage to negotiate their own contracts.</p>
        <p>So is $1,354 a fair amount? For a job that involves acting, singing and dancing, not to mention applause and living out the dream of anyone who has played Tevye or Eliza Doolittle in high school, the figure doesn't sound half bad. But Alan Eisenberg, the executive director of Actors' Equity, said that over the last four years, the average Broadway or road show actor has performed just 26 weeks a year. Moreover, actors are not compensated for dance classes, voice lessons, audition coaches, weight training, physical therapy, agents, managers and school loan payments. (Though of course, a portion of any professional expense is tax deductible.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenberg put it bluntly: ''Salaries of Equity members stink.''</p>
        <p>Jed Bernstein, the president of the producers' league, countered that the figure must be viewed in context. ''It's not just the naked question of 'Is $1,300 enough or not?' '' he said. For example, work rules limit the number of hours actors can work in a day, and all 45,000 Equity members get medical benefits, though it's the industry's health that is questionable.</p>
        <p>''The commercial theater, in which four out of five productions fail to even pay back their initial investment, is forever under enormous cost pressure,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''There are very few industries that are in business today that can deal with that failure rate.''</p>
        <p>Besides, shouldn't performers be satisfied with a minimum salary that has increased far faster than inflation? Fifty years ago, in the 1953-54 season, the minimum scale was $85 a week, which, in 2004 dollars, equals only $589, not half as much as $1,354. If, as Mr. Eisenberg says, ''there is too much talent for not enough jobs and that is a market force'' pushing salaries down, why has the minimum salary outpaced inflation?</p>
        <p>Because, Mr. Eisenberg explained, $85 was ''a very, very, very low figure'' in the first place, so salaries had to outpace inflation just to reach a more adequate level. And it isn't just salaries that have shot up: production costs as a whole have skyrocketed past inflation. One indication of this is ticket prices. The top price for a musical has gone from $6.60 at the end of the 1953-54 season -- or about $46 in 2004 dollars -- to $100 today. That's an increase, in real dollars, of 119 percent, which is comparable to 130 percent, the rise in the Equity minimum scale over the same period.</p>
        <p>Luckily for actors, they don't have to buy tickets to their own shows.</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2004, Sunday  An article on May 23 about the minimum salaries of Broadway performers under the Actors' Equity contract misstated the proportion of Equity members who receive medical benefits. Members must work at least 12 weeks under an Equity contract within a 12-month period to qualify. Six percent of the membership currently receives benefits, not all members.</p>
