        <p>WHILE there are many differences between the Nissan Armada and the Infiniti QX56, three stand out:</p>
        <p>The Nissan's 5.6-liter engine has been reconfigured a bit to develop slightly more horsepower in the Infiniti (315 compared with 305) and a tad more torque.</p>
        <p>The Infiniti, in addition to its standard leather seating and fancier trim, can be had with a camera in the rear license place holder that provides a moving image of what, or whom, is lurking behind.</p>
        <p>The Infiniti, starting around $50,000, costs some $14,000 more.</p>
        <p>I liked the rear camera. It projects several feet behind the vehicle and is angled to capture images of parked cars' bumpers, people walking behind the truck, even small dogs.</p>
        <p>There is also one big similarity between the near-twins: their driving manners are much alike. Both were surprisingly quick off the line, given their size, with plenty of low-speed torque for passing. Both were also a little noisier than I would expect for trucks in this price range.</p>
        <p>Infiniti says there is a lot more that distinguishes the QX56, including a slightly different grille, taillamps that consist of light-emitting diodes, a power liftgate, a DVD-based navigation system, standard heated seats, second-row captain chairs and an analog clock in the center of the dash (one that is too low, unfortunately, to be easily read).</p>
        <p>You would expect all of that from a top-of-the-line truck aimed at the segment's big boys, like the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. But there is no power mechanism to fold the third-row seat up or down, like those in the Navigator or Cadillac SRX. Nor is the seat split in half (or in a 60-40 proportion) like the competition's.</p>
        <p>The QX made an impression even in car-conscious Southern California. ''Is this Infiniti's new S.U.V.?'' asked the car jockey at the Four Seasons Hotel. ''Wow, nice.'' He immediately gave it a place of honor in front, amid the Mercedeses and Lexuses.</p>
        <p>Later, a couple closed up their Navigator and rushed over to inspect the QX56. They were impressed with the power, but not keen on the interior, which wasn't as plush as they had hoped it would be.</p>
        <p>Did the side windows, which rise weirdly to a peak, bother them? ''Didn't notice them,'' said the man, who was closely inspecting the cargo area, which offers more than 10 feet of floor area when the front passenger seat is folded down.</p>
        <p>The QX56 was solid and well mannered in both city and country. One incongruous item was the gated shifter in the center console, which allows the driver to move through the five forward gears with a flick of the stick. Infiniti is hardly the first to offer this faux-hot-rod feature on a 4x4, but it still seems superfluous.</p>
        <p>I tried shifting the gears myself, but it seemed like too much work. After all, I was already trying to watch the navigation system and hold the big plush beast in lane without breaking a sweat.</p>
