        <p>Australian architect Sean Godsell creates emergency housing out of used shipping container; prototype is on display at Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York; museum's renovated shop also noted; photos (Currents column) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Sean Godsell, an architect from Melbourne, Australia, has transformed a used shipping container into FutureShack, a temporary emergency shelter. A prototype will be in the garden of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum tomorrow through Oct. 10. Shipping containers, Mr. Godsell said, ''are like wire hangers from the dry cleaners -- everywhere and easy to get.''</p>
        <p>The prototype interior, below right, is insulated and has a kitchen and a bathroom; built-in beds and a table fold down from plywood walls. A roof made of polycarbonate and photovoltaic panels floats above the container on a steel frame, right. (The pitched roofline, Mr. Godsell said, is a universal symbol for a house.) The materials cost roughly $27,800, not including development costs and professional fees, but a large order could lower the price to about $15,000 a unit. Mr. Godsell planned to sell FutureShack only to relief organizations and has turned down private clients. But he did relent for an eco-tourism resort in the Australian outback, which has ordered five.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow the museum also unveils its renovated shop, left. The store sells classic modern designs and one-of-a-kind pieces. Gregory Krum, the shop's retail director, commissioned new work from Anton Ginzburg, who was featured in the Cooper-Hewitt's recent design triennial. Among Mr. Ginzburg's creations are porcelain plates with a 22-karat gold rim and underside (inset, top left, $78 each). Admission, adults $10, students and seniors, $7. Cooper-Hewitt Museum, 2 East 91st Street (Fifth Avenue); (212) 849-8400.</p>
