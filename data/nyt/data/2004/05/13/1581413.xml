      <abstract>
        <p>Joan M Maiman letter says coverage of furor over mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib illustrates problem that far too few American leaders have any experience serving in armed forces, and so do not understand how horrific nature of warfare impels honorable people to act in such ways</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The coverage of the furor over the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by members of the United States military has graphically illustrated a serious problem with American leadership: far too few of our political figures have any experience serving in the armed forces, let alone serving in a combat zone.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The coverage of the furor over the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by members of the United States military has graphically illustrated a serious problem with American leadership: far too few of our political figures have any experience serving in the armed forces, let alone serving in a combat zone.</p>
        <p>As someone who spent a year in Vietnam (as a Red Cross hospital worker) in the early 1970's and who later served as a commissioner with the Illinois Agent Orange Study Commission, I saw firsthand the terrible and far-reaching decisions that very young Americans had to make under unimaginable pressure.</p>
        <p>The horrific nature of warfare makes it impossible for anyone who has not experienced combat to understand fully why honorable young men and women may act in ways that they themselves would never have imagined.</p>
        <p>To address this disconnect between policy makers and the men and women they send to fight our wars, perhaps those who would be public servants should first serve the public as members of the armed forces.</p>
