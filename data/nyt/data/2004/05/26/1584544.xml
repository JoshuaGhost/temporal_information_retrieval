        <p>If you want to eat the way the Chinese do when you are in Chinatown but have no familiarity with Mandarin or Cantonese, how do you face the untranslated lists of dishes posted on walls or menus? ''The Eater's Guide to Chinese Characters,'' by James D. McCawley (University of Chicago, $15), a paperback edition of a book first published in 1984, could help. But this is not ''Chinese Menus for Dummies.'' It will take some serious study to recognize and understand the characters while you are waiting for your pot of tea, but in the end, you might be able to tell whether those stuffed buns are baked or steamed, and whether something called chicken legs is really chicken feet. Chinese characters are often more specific in describing dishes, and English translations are error-prone. For example, a dish called Two Crisp in English is actually pig tripe and dried squid. The book also has a rudimentary guide to pronunciation.</p>
