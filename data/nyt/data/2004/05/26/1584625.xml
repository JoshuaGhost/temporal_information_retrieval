        <p>Editorial scores Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation roles in arrest of Brandon Mayfield in Madrid railroad bombings based on error in fingerprint identification; notes arrest came even though Spanish authorities cast doubt on match; sees rush to judgment on flimsy evidence, with decision to arrest him influenced by his Muslim ties</p>

        <p>The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ought to hang their heads in shame over the mistaken arrest and jailing of a Muslim lawyer in Oregon who was supposed to be a material witness in the Madrid train bombing case. The arrest turned out to be based on a faulty fingerprint identification by F.B.I. ''experts.'' That finding was ultimately retracted when more careful Spanish investigators concluded that the fingerprint had actually been left by a different man. Federal authorities apologized for the error and the unjustified jail time, but they still have a lot of explaining to do. The case smacks of a rush to judgment based on flimsy evidence.

        <p>The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ought to hang their heads in shame over the mistaken arrest and jailing of a Muslim lawyer in Oregon who was supposed to be a material witness in the Madrid train bombing case. The arrest turned out to be based on a faulty fingerprint identification by F.B.I. ''experts.'' That finding was ultimately retracted when more careful Spanish investigators concluded that the fingerprint had actually been left by a different man. Federal authorities apologized for the error and the unjustified jail time, but they still have a lot of explaining to do. The case smacks of a rush to judgment based on flimsy evidence. Clearly fingerprint analysis is not the gold standard it is cracked up to be. The method itself is not foolproof, and the analysts who provide the final judgment sometimes make the wrong call.</p>
        <p>The fiasco started when the Spanish police sent the F.B.I. digital photographic images of some partial latent fingerprints taken from a plastic bag found in a van linked to the Madrid bombings. An automated searching system compared the images with millions of prints on file and came up with possible matches. F.B.I. analysts made the final judgment that a print submitted from Spain was identical to prints on file for Brandon Mayfield. Three F.B.I. examiners considered the match to be a ''100 percent identification'' of Mr. Mayfield. A court-appointed examiner agreed.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, the Spanish authorities cast doubt on that judgment, but the Justice Department sought Mr. Mayfield's detention anyway, based on the F.B.I.'s insistence that it had identified the right man. Investigators offered other evidence that appeared to cast suspicion on Mr. Mayfield. He had represented a man in a custody dispute who later pleaded guilty to conspiring to help Al Qaeda fight American forces in Afghanistan. He had attended a local mosque and placed ads for his law practice in a publication whose owner was linked to terrorists. A phone call was made between his home and the number of the local director of an Islamic charity who was suspected of terrorist ties abroad. All that now looks coincidental.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. blames its error on an image of substandard quality sent by the Spanish police. But it is shocking that the F.B.I. would initially express certitude based on one partial print. The United States attorney in Portland insists that religion had nothing to do with the investigation because Mr. Mayfield was not under suspicion when the F.B.I. first analyzed the prints. But the decision to lock up Mr. Mayfield was clearly influenced by his Muslim ties. It is sobering evidence that the current legal crackdown on suspected terrorists can yield injustice for those who are innocent.</p>
