        <p>US Court of Appeals issues decision on whether power company that violates Clean Air Act can receive permit to build new plant; Sierra Club had filed suit in Georgia (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit decided that the Environmental Protection Agency had acted ''arbitrarily and capriciously'' in ruling that Oglethorpe Power could receive a building permit for a power plant near Franklin in Heard County when it owns part of another plant, Robert W. Scherer, near Forsyth, northwest of Macon, that violates the Clean Air Act. The court said that ''without considering the issue at all,'' the E.P.A. assumed that it could consider only the parts of the Scherer plant that Oglethorpe owned and disregard the other parts, which are the polluters. The Georgia Power division of the Southern Company is a co-owner. The Sierra Club, which sued, said the plant was under the owners' common control. Oglethorpe did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
