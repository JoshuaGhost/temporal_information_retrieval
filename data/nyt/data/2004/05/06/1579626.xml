        <p>Two advocates of teaching evolution in public schools were elected Tuesday to the school board in Darby, Mont., a town of 754 people that became a focus in a national debate over religion and science. They defeated candidates who endorsed a proposal by a local Baptist minister, Curtis Brickley, to incorporate criticisms of Charles Darwin's theories of evolution into the science curriculum and created a new majority on the board opposing Mr. Brickley.</p>
