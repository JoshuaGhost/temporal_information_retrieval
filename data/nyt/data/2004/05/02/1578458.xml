        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Richard Pearson Thomas is a composer and a member of South Country Concerts, a chamber ensemble based in Bellport. He was asked by Lisa Radakovich Holsberg, a soprano who teaches voice at Long Island University's C.W. Post campus in Brookville, to set to music poems written by ordinary people after Sept. 11, 2001, and found posted throughout New York City. They were collected by City Lore, a folk arts organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said that in composing the music, he felt a great responsibility to the poets, ''who were coming from very emotional places.''</p>
        <p>''How could I be honest about my reaction to the attack, and respectful of their extremely personal reactions without being sentimental?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas and Ms. Holsberg chose three poems to set to music: ''To the Towers Themselves'' (anonymous); ''How My Life Has Changed'' by Hilary North, who worked in one of the towers; and ''Don't Look for Me Anymore'' by Alicia Vasquez.</p>
        <p>Along with a violin solo, the three texts make up Mr. Thomas's suite, ''Race for the Sky.'' Sung by Deborah Birnbaum, a soprano, and with Mr. Thomas at the piano and Sarah Schwartz on violin, the suite is featured in a performance by South Country Concerts today at 5 p.m. at Christ Episcopal Church. The church is on South Country Road in Bellport. Information: (631)286-1592.</p>
