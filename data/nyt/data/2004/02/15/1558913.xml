        <p>Charlize Theron</p>
        <p>Charlize Theron's disturbing, uncannily accurate impersonation of the Florida serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ''Monster'' illustrates the paradox inherent in serious acting. For all the emotional soul-baring that goes into a memorable performance, acting is also a form of disguise, which succeeds to the degree that the actor disappears into the role. Yet with variants of Method acting dominating the screen, makeup and prosthetics tend to be regarded as useful novelty accouterments rather than tools for the discovery of emotional truth.</p>
        <p>Without the liquid latex that transformed her creamy complexion into a freckled, sun-damaged husk or the heavy dentures that shifted the weight of her face from her cheekbones to her jaw and transformed her model-perfect smile into a yellowed, crooked-toothed grin, Charlize Theron could not have disappeared into her character so easily. Much credit is due to Toni G, the makeup artist who supervised her transformation.</p>

        <p>Charlize Theron's disturbing, uncannily accurate impersonation of the Florida serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ''Monster'' illustrates the paradox inherent in serious acting. For all the emotional soul-baring that goes into a memorable performance, acting is also a form of disguise, which succeeds to the degree that the actor disappears into the role. Yet with variants of Method acting dominating the screen, makeup and prosthetics tend to be regarded as useful novelty accouterments rather than tools for the discovery of emotional truth.</p>
        <p>Without the liquid latex that transformed her creamy complexion into a freckled, sun-damaged husk or the heavy dentures that shifted the weight of her face from her cheekbones to her jaw and transformed her model-perfect smile into a yellowed, crooked-toothed grin, Charlize Theron could not have disappeared into her character so easily. Much credit is due to Toni G, the makeup artist who supervised her transformation.</p>
        <p>Brilliant as it is, however, the disguise wouldn't count for much if Ms. Theron hadn't also dug deep into herself and found emotional corollaries to the desperate street person she was portraying. The actress found the perfect body language to go with her Wuornos look. The modified prizefighter's swagger she developed implied Wuornos's explosive violence, but also suggested a bravado that revealed her profound, underlying insecurity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Theron's gait in the movie is actually more exaggerated than that of the real-life Wuornos shown in Nick Broomfield's documentary ''Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer.'' But it clearly helped the actress define Wuornos's humanity along with her psychosis. You could call the performance a stunt, but its consistency and power also make it a work of art that transcends the fakery behind it.</p>
