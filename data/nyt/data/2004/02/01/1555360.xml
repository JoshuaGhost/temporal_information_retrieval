        <p>Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer turned talk-show host, is an old hand in the cabaret world. In fact, he is appearing at Joe's Pub in Manhattan this week. And he often sings during his show on the Oxygen network, accompanied by his pianist, Ben Walzer.</p>

        <p>So it's no surprise that Mr. Mizrahi has now turned up as a vocalist in his latest commercials for Target stores, where he sells a line of modestly priced clothes.</p>
        <p>That's Mr. Mizrahi's pleasant voice singing ''I Believe in You'' from ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'' as models show off his spring collection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizrahi still has one more rung to climb in his commercials, that of full-fledged Hollywood production number, Ã  la the late Ann Miller, who once tap-danced on soup cans. If sales sag, maybe Mr. Mizrahi can call in the Rockettes, with whom he has performed on his show.</p>
