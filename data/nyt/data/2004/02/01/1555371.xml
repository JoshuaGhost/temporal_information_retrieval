        <p>Re ''Amid News of the Nets, Memories of Moses,'' the Jan. 25 Coping column by Anemona Hartocollis: I suspect that Robert Moses would have favored Bruce Ratner's proposal for an arena for the Nets. While the O'Malley Dodgers (we erroneously thought they were Brooklyn's) were interested in the same space, the proposed sports arena is only a small part of the developer's vision.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Amid News of the Nets, Memories of Moses,'' the Jan. 25 Coping column by Anemona Hartocollis: I suspect that Robert Moses would have favored Bruce Ratner's proposal for an arena for the Nets. While the O'Malley Dodgers (we erroneously thought they were Brooklyn's) were interested in the same space, the proposed sports arena is only a small part of the developer's vision.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons why Brooklyn should not use eminent domain to increase private profit. For one thing, this site is within a stone's throw of two major bridges, in a county that already ranks high in cancer risk from hazardous air pollutants. Surely allergy, asthma and cancer are a concern for all Brooklyn residents.</p>
        <p>As for the yards themselves, why not roof them for community markets, stalls for vendors and greenmarkets? Such an anchor would be a major benefit for Brooklyn's small businesses, which are reeling, and the many artists and artisans who live and work here.</p>
        <p>It might take the skill of a Robert Moses to part the sea of red tape for such a project. But unlike some of Moses' works, this can and should be done with a compassion for Brooklynites.</p>
