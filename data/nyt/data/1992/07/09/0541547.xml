        <p>He couldn't understand why major league club owners would place so much authority in the hands of one man, the judge said, but they did.

        <p>He couldn't understand why major league club owners would place so much authority in the hands of one man, the judge said, but they did. That is why the Federal jurist, Frank McGarr, decided 15 years ago that Bowie Kuhn had the right to tell Charlie Finley he couldn't sell his players for millions.</p>
        <p>Since that decision in United States District Court in Chicago, the owners have had numerous opportunities to change the agreement that gives the commissioner all of that authority. Unlike their predecessors in 1945, who reduced the commissioner's authority, they have chosen not to tamper with or dilute the commissioner's powers. They only complain about them.</p>
        <p>Though many owners really want a weak commissioner, one who won't give them any trouble, they'll never admit it. Some, like Jerry Reinsdorf owner of the Chicago White Sox and Bulls, would prefer no commissioner at all.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Cubs are the latest to challenge the authority they have never wanted to change. Whether or not they get past the provision in the Major League Agreement that bars clubs from suing commissioners will be seen in the next few weeks as they fight in Federal court in Chicago for the right not to change their divisional address.</p>
        <p>The commissioner's authority, due process and rules of procedure are terms that these days are as relevant in baseball as hit-and-run, stolen base and pitchout. They are, however, not nearly as easy to understand.</p>
        <p>When people hear due process, they think of the country's judicial system and the rights the individual is afforded by the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment says the Federal Government shall not deprive a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The 14th Amendment applies that to the states.</p>
        <p>Private organizations, on the other hand, have no obligation to guarantee their employees constitutional rights. Major league baseball is a private organization. Its players are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the commissioner cannot violate labor or other laws, but he is not obligated to adhere to constitutional requirements in dealing with players or nonuniformed personnel in their roles as employees.</p>
        <p>Thus, for example, owners and managers may be punished for commenting critically on an umpire's performance, an act, which if done by government, would violate First Amendment rights to free speech. It may not seem fair; it may even be repugnant to some. But it's perfectly permissible in the private sector.</p>
        <p>"We think of the First Amendment as protection of free speech," said Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. "But as with all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it serves as a limitation only against governmental entities. The same rights wouldn't be extended to a private employee. The employer, in most instances, can say you have no First Amendment rights because the First Amendment is not a limitation on a private organization."</p>
        <p>Even less easily understood in baseball are the commissioner's rules of procedure. The Major League Agreement stipulates that the commissioner shall, from time to time, announce rules of procedure to be observed "in all claims and disputes submitted to the commissioner." It says nothing about disciplinary proceedings the commissioner initiates, such as the Pete Rose and George Steinbrenner investigations.</p>
        <p>The current commissioner recently revoked the rules of procedure, prompting an anonymous and unfriendly owner to criticize him. A report in The Daily News last week quoting the owner stressed that the commissioner "unilaterally" revoked the rules. That, however, is the only way the rules can be affected because they are the commissioner's rules and no one else's.</p>
        <p>Lawyers familiar with the history and past use of the rules of procedure say the commissioner has the right to change them and even eliminate them, as long as he announces the new rules before any proceeding he conducts. If he were to convene a hearing on a dispute submitted to him without telling the parties ahead of time what rules of procedure he planned to follow, he would be in violation of the Major League Agreement.</p>
        <p>Paul Gewirtz, a law professor at Yale University, offered one note of caution. By not having an established set of rules, Gewirtz said, the commissioner "is opening himself to the charge that he is writing the rules to affect the outcome."</p>
        <p>The owners who might make that charge are probably the same owners who contend that the commissioner has exceeded his authority when his decisions affect them.</p>
        <p>Individual owners generally complain only when they are affected. That's why there has been no groundswell for modification of the commissioner's authority since 1945. Most owners evidently like the authority the way it is. Their predecessors certainly felt strongly about it in 1964 because they restored the powers that had been taken away nearly 20 years earlier.</p>
        <p>As Judge McGarr said in 1977: "The questionable wisdom of this broad delegation of power is not before the court. And what the parties intended was that the commissioner was to have jurisdication to prevent any conduct destructive of the confidence in the integrity of baseball. So broad and unfettered was his discretion intended to be that they provided no right of appeal, and even took the extreme step of foreclosing their own access to the courts."  ON BASEBALL</p>
