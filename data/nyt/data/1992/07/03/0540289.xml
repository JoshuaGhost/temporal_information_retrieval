        <p>The Khmer Rouge refused again today to disarm its 20,000-strong army, a move that is threatening to undermine the peace settlement signed last year to end Cambodia's 13-year civil war.</p>
        <p>After a meeting here of senior officials of the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodian factions, diplomats said Khmer Rouge leaders signaled no new willingness to begin the process of disarmament -- a central component of the peace treaty arranged last year by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Western and Asian diplomats in Phnom Penh said they did not believe that negotiations were at an end or that there was any immediate threat of the resumption of full-scale fighting.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials and foreign diplomats said they are perplexed over the motives of the Khmer Rouge, a Communist group that is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of anywhere from several hundred thousand to more then one million Cambodians when it controlled the government in the middle and late 1970's.</p>
        <p>Many diplomats believe the Khmer Rouge are trying to delay the peace process in order to grab more territory before elections planned for next year.</p>
        <p>Under the peace treaty, soldiers from the Khmer Rouge, two non-Communist rebel groups and the army of the Vietnamese-installed Government were supposed to begin turning in their arms last month under the supervision of the United Nations. Unlike the other factions, the Khmer Rouge force have refused to disarm despite a commitment its leaders made in signing the peace treaty last fall. At the same time, there have been reports of fire fights in recent weeks in central Cambodia between Khmer Rouge troops and Cambodian Government soldiers.</p>
