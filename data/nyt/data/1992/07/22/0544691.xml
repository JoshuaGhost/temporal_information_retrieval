        <p>One of this century's largest migrations is under way through the dun-colored mountain peaks of the Khyber Pass. More than 600,000 of the 3.2 million Afghans who fled the war that ravaged their country over the last 14 years, have abandoned their Pakistan encampments and headed home to shattered villages, mined fields and, inevitably, desperate poverty.</p>
        <p>Each week, the flow of refugees across the frontier and into southern Afghanistan toward Kandahar, swells. Garishly painted Pakistani trucks lumber over the border, swaying under the weight of the refugees' household goods, heading toward their homes.</p>
        <p>But despite the surge of returning refugees, United Nations officials are worried that they do not have enough wheat or money to continue the repatriation, much less start rebuilding. Shortfall in Aid</p>
        <p>Benon Sevon, the special representative for Afghanistan of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said that of the $180 million requested in June for repatriation and reconstruction, only $29 million had been received, a shortfall he attributed to demands on the United Nations in Yugoslavia, Cambodia and in the horn of Africa.</p>
        <p>"Afghanistan is facing an emergency situation," Mr. Sevon said. "There are too many demands. The new emergencies are getting the lion's share of money. There are 330,000 Cambodian refugees and they have asked for $109 million. There are six million Afghan refugees and we have asked for $180 million for everything. People have developed an immunity to the images of Afghanistan. But unless funds are forthcoming, we will face an even bigger disaster. Right now we cannot help these people to feed themselves. I have no money to buy seeds. I have no money to buy tools. These people deserve better."</p>
        <p>Salaluddin, a short man with a weathered face and a wild black beard, glanced back at the Khyber Pass, at Pakistan. "This is home," he said. And then he hoisted himself into the cab of an ornately carved, painted and banner-festooned truck. Its gears rattled impatiently and then the truck, piled with bed frames, roof poles, bags of wheat, cooking pots and a cow, crept off toward a distant home.</p>
        <p>After 14 years of war, after the deaths of more than one million Afghans and the exile of more than six million, an enormous tide of humanity is sweeping back people like Mr. Salaluddin and his family to villages and cities ruled by armed guerrilla groups, disused fields often full of mines and a coming winter will likely be the toughest in their lives.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the war, some 3.2 million Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan, and 3 million others fled to safety in Iran. Along the border, in less than three months, more than 600,000 Afghans, many of whom have spent more than a decade in refugee camps in Pakistan, have headed back. And every week, more leave.</p>
        <p>When Kabul fell to a coalition of Islamic guerrilla armies last April and the remaining fragments of the Government of former President Najibullah were brushed away, the uneasy alliance of rebels and Government militias inherited a country physically devastated and psychologically battered. But the urgency of rebuilding was quickly submerged in conflicts among different ethnic and sectarian groups battling for dominance.</p>
        <p>Clashes on Sunday between an Iranian-backed guerrilla faction and forces allied with the current Government in Kabul left 60 people dead and more than 300 wounded. Amid this fighting, the transitional government of Berhanuddin Rabbani, the country's Prime Minister, has been unable to establish its authority over the capital, much less the rest of the country. Cease-Fire Announced</p>
        <p>[ Afghanistan's ruling council announced a permanent cease-fire in Kabul after a local truce had ended three days of fighting between rival factions, Reuters reported.Still, it said, hundreds of families continued to pour out of western Kabul districts, which had been worst hit by the fighting. ]</p>
        <p>Mohammed Khan stood patiently in line at the final United Nations processing center in Jamrud, north of Peshawar, quietly rolling and unrolling his plastic-covered ration book, waiting to exchange his refugee number for the 3,300 Pakistani rupees, about $135, and an allowance of wheat the United Nations would give him.</p>
        <p>"I've been here 11 years," said Mr. Khan. "I visited my village a month ago. There are no trees, no walls, no construction. There is the danger of mines. But I am bringing my family back."</p>
        <p>"There is no sign of shade in my village," he went on. "We are north of Jalalabad. The first thing I will do is build shelter. For 14 years there were no people in my village. I don't know how I'll deal with the situation. Some people who have already gone to the village have died from mines." And then the line moved forward, Mr. Khan showed his ration book, his refugee number clipped from it, and he was given his money.</p>
        <p>For the last six weeks, the number of refugees surrendering the ration books that have helped keep them alive all these years has steadily swelled. Last week, about 80,000 Afghans left for home. At the Korasan camp just outside Peshawar, a mud-walled stadium once used for buzkashi, the Afghan sport where horsemen battle over the carcass of a dead goat, has been plowed and wheat planted. Impatience at Refugees</p>
        <p>Although the hardships the refugees face are daunting, United Nations officials see a distinct impatience toward them in Pakistan, which has sheltered them for the duration of the war. Robert Breen, a United Nations official working on the border, said: "In Afghan culture the most insulting thing is to be told to leave. They'd rather leave with dignity and on their own terms. They are not fools. They fully recognize that assistance in the camps is going to stop."</p>
        <p>Although many refugees lived solely off rations provided by the Pakistanis and international agencies, many worked in Peshawar and surrounding areas as laborers and taxi drivers, opened shops and even organized smuggling rings. In Hyatabad, an upper-middle-class suburb of Peshawar, virtually all the commuter buses were owned and driven by Afghans. When the rush home began in the last two months, the suburbanites suddenly found themselves without bus services.</p>
        <p>Before climbing into the truck that would take him home, Mr. Salaluddin talked about what he faced. "My house was destroyed so we have to rebuild it," he said. "I live near Kabul. In the beginning I will stay with relatives. I'm taking my whole family and all my household materials. All of our neighbors left for Kabul. There's nobody left here."</p>
