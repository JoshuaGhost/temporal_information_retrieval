        <p>President Bush announced today that the United States would no longer produce plutonium or enriched uranium used in nuclear warheads, codifying as policy a suspension that had been in effect for years because of arms cuts and problems within the nuclear weapons complex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush described the move as one of a series of steps intended to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. By renouncing the production of fissionable material, the United States hopes to add weight to its efforts to persuade nations in the Middle East, South Asia and other potential flash points, to take similar steps, Bush Administration officials said.</p>
        <p>But the Presidential initiative, developed in secret and announced by the White House on the first day of the Democratic National Convention, will have no practical effect on the American nuclear weapons arsenal, and some arms control specialists complained that it did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>The production of nuclear weapons material has effectively been halted since 1988 because of mechanical and environmental problems at Government reactors and weapons plants. No new warheads are in production. And with the recent decision to slash strategic arms and withdraw tactical nuclear weapons from the United States arsenal, there is a surfeit of nuclear material that can be recycled to make new weapons should the Pentagon decide they are needed.  Recycling Still Possible</p>
        <p>Nothing in the new Presidential initiative precludes the United States from recycling the material in old warheads to make new ones, a senior Administration official acknowledged today.</p>
        <p>In announcing the move in a statement issued from his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Bush said Washington "is committed to take a leading role in the international effort to thwart the spread of technologies and weapons that cast a cloud over our future."</p>
        <p>But Christopher Paine, a specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move would be largely discounted because other countries are aware that the United States nuclear weapons complex has stopped producing nuclear materials. "They are trying to make a virtue of the obvious," Mr. Paine said.</p>
        <p>Long regarded as a technical, secondary foreign policy concern, the spread of nuclear weapons has become a political issue in this year's election campaign. Democratic lawmakers have assailed the Bush Administration for failing to take tough steps to stop the Iraqi nuclear weapon program before the Persian Gulf war. After the war it was learned through Iraqi defectors and United Nations inspectors that the Iraqi nuclear program was far more advanced than American intelligence had suspected. Gorbachev Proposed Initiative</p>
        <p>The initiative announced today appeared to be intended in part to show that the Administration was actively engaged in combating the spread of nuclear weapons and thus blunt the Democratic charges.</p>
        <p>The proposal to ban the production of plutonium and enriched uranium was put forward by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when he was the President of the Soviet Union, but it was rejected by the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>The United States stopped the production of plutonium in 1988 and has not produced enriched uranium for nuclear purposes since 1964. Energy Department officials have told Congress that there were no plans to produce plutonium and enriched uranium for weapons purposes.</p>
        <p>"It is true that we have not produced plutonium for some time," a senior Administration told reporters today. "What we have done as a matter of practice, we are now saying we are making a matter of policy."</p>
        <p>The senior official argued that the decision to publicly reject the option of resuming the production of nuclear weapons materials was nonetheless an important step, which a number of foreign governments have urged the Administration to take.</p>
        <p>Some arms control experts complained that the Administration's initiative was largely a codification of the status quo and asserted that Washington should have proposed additional steps. These might include a ban or new limitations on nuclear testing or a verifiable, international agreement to stop the production of fissionable material and monitor the destruction of excess nuclear material, the critics said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the ban on nuclear materials production, the Bush Administration said it would step up its efforts to tighten international export controls. It said it would consult with allies to insure that tough actions, such as embargoes, be taken against countries that violate agreements designed to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>The Administration also said it would support efforts to set up an international fund to carry out special inspections and to help nations destroy weapons stockpiles. Previously, the Bush Administration has not supported increases in the budget of International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear safeguards, experts said.</p>
        <p>Gary Milhollin, the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said many of the principles enunciated by the Bush Administration were laudable. "The question is whether they will actually carry them out and one can have doubts on that," added Mr. Milhollin, who had been critical of the Administration's policies to curb the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
