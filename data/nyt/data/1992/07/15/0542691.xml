        <p>American Airlines will try again to raise its fares, increasing them an average of 4.4 percent starting on Saturday, to help pay for higher fuel prices. It will also impose additional increases in about 15 percent of its markets to make up for earlier price cuts.</p>
        <p>Whether the increases stick will depend on whether other leading carriers plan to go along. With many strong carriers like United, Delta Air Lines and Northwest suffering big losses because of the broad overhaul of the fare structure that began in April, the latest American move to bring fares back up has a good chance of succeeding.</p>

        <p>American Airlines will try again to raise its fares, increasing them an average of 4.4 percent starting on Saturday, to help pay for higher fuel prices. It will also impose additional increases in about 15 percent of its markets to make up for earlier price cuts.</p>
        <p>Whether the increases stick will depend on whether other leading carriers plan to go along. With many strong carriers like United, Delta Air Lines and Northwest suffering big losses because of the broad overhaul of the fare structure that began in April, the latest American move to bring fares back up has a good chance of succeeding.</p>
        <p>Jon Austin, a spokesman for Northwest, said the carrier would raise its fares by 4.4 percent on Saturday. United is also planning a comparable increase in its fares. Higher Fares in Key Markets</p>
        <p>An attempt to raise air fares a similar amount last week fell apart after each airline sought to put its particular spin on fare increases, causing confusion on how to proceed.</p>
        <p>The American move will mean much higher fares in some important markets. For the Los Angeles to New York route, for example, the full coach fare was $752 one way before American pushed through a radical change in the fare structure in April. After the change, the fare dropped to $460 and then fell again a few weeks later to $380. As of Saturday, that fare will go up to $480 one way.</p>
        <p>Even with the current round of increases, fares are still far below the levels before April 13. At that time, American began a major restructuring by cutting full coach fares by about 40 percent and discount fares a few weeks later by about 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American, cut full coach fares in order to eliminate the incentive for the carriers to offer discounts to big corporations.</p>
        <p>The behind-the-scenes discounting made a mockery of the fare structure, enabling big companies like I.B.M. to get discounts of 40 to 50 percent, while many smaller companies and independent businessmen and others forced to travel on short notice were paying full coach fares.</p>
        <p>The lower full coach fares brought corporate discounting to a virtual standstill.</p>
        <p>But John H. Dasburg, the president of Northwest, said this week that the carrier planned to revive corporate discounts, a position that puzzled some analysts.</p>
        <p>Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst at County NatWest, a securities firm in New York, said any move by Northwest could be quickly matched by other carriers. 'Secret for About Five Seconds'</p>
        <p>"There isn't anyone who cuts secret deals," she said. "They're secret for about five seconds. They will be matched. Nobody will be allowed to have a lower price since demand has not been strong."</p>
        <p>Mr. Crandall has vowed that he will cut the full coach fare down to the level offered to a corporation by another carrier to take away any incentive to offer the special discounts.</p>
        <p>John Hotard, a spokesman for American, said the carrier would be competitive. He added, however, that American would not go back to offering discounts to individual companies.</p>
        <p>"We heard loud and clear that the public did not like the discounts," he said.</p>
