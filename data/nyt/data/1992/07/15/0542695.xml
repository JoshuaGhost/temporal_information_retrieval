        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins has raised about $893,000 for his re-election effort since January, far less than his main Democratic rival, Andrew J. Stein, has collected, officials from both campaigns said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins has raised about $893,000 for his re-election effort since January, far less than his main Democratic rival, Andrew J. Stein, has collected, officials from both campaigns said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The likely Republican candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has done slightly better than Mr. Dinkins, raising about $1,025,000 over the same six-month period, said a spokesman for his campaign, Kenneth Frydman.</p>
        <p>The money the Mayor raised fell short of campaign expectations. The Mayor had hoped to raise $1 million at a single fund-raising dinner on April 20 at the New York Sheraton Hotel. That event, his biggest fund-raiser of the year, was widely interpreted as a test of whether he could bounce back from a scandal in January involving the theft of $158,000 from the campaign by a top aide. The amount of money raised at the dinner was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's opponents were quick to interpret the shortfall as a sign of his political weakness, but his aides played down its importance, saying they had done better than they expected. "We put out that we wanted to raise a million, but our target within the committee was really more like $750,000," said Kenneth Glover, an RJR Nabisco executive who is the Dinkins campaign treasurer. 'Pretty Bad Shape'tyy</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein, who is the City Council President, saw it differently. "A year ago, Dinkins was politically dead," he said yesterday. "Now he's just in pretty bad shape. If I had his positive-negative numbers, I wouldn't sleep at night."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Glover asserted that Mr. Stein's success reflected his refusal to abide by the limits set out in the city's campaign finance law, which caps individual contributions to a mayoral election at $6,500 and matches up to $1,000 of each contribution with public funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein has eschewed the voluntary program, calling it a waste of tax-payer's money, while Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani are both participating in it.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. Stein kicked off his mayoral campaign at a glitzy fund-raising dinner where tickets sold for $1,500 to $5,000. Several of his largest contributors have given gifts ranging from $25,000 to $50,000, according to the Board of Elections.</p>
        <p>"The Mayor's base is not necessarily people who can write $50,000 checks," Mr. Glover said. Disclosure Report</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Dinkins released his campaign disclosure report -- a three-quarter-inch thick stack of records -- a day before the deadline to file with the State Board of Elections. Mr. Stein and Mr. Giuliani were expected to file their reports today. Their campaigns released some figures last night.</p>
        <p>Since January, the report shows, the Dinkins committee raised $893,575 in monetary contributions, $10,971 in various free goods and services, and earned $13,524 in interest. It also spent about $361,235 during the same period, leaving it with $791,000 on hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dinkins's campaign suffered a serious setback in January after a campaign official stole $158,000 from the re-election treasury. The embezzlement wiped out about half the money the campaign had raised to that point. Dinkins aides said the scandal had not hurt fund-raising efforts.</p>
        <p>Arnold I. Biegen, a close associate of the Mayor and the campaign's finance director, pleaded guilty in February to stealing $158,000 from the campaign.</p>
        <p>Philip Friedman, a consultant to Mr. Stein, said the campaign has raised $1.5 million so far this year, giving him $1.8 million.</p>
        <p>During the same period, Mr. Giuliani raised $1,025,000, Mr. Frydman said. About $990,000 flowed from a dinner on May 18. The campaign has spent about $295,000 and has $800,743 in the bank.</p>
