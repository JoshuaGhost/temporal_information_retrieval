        <p>The 3-month-old baby who was found in the Bronx on Thursday under a bed near the bodies of her slain parents and stepbrother remained hospitalized yesterday in stable condition, the police said. Police officers found the bodies and the baby, Tiffany, when they responded to complaints of loud music coming from an apartment at 2034 Benedict Avenue in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. The baby, whose last name is not being released, was taken to the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, where she was treated for a temperature of 105 degrees and hyperventilation.</p>
