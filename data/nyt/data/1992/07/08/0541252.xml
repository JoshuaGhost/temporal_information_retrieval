        <p>Abortion rights advocates went to Federal court today to challenge the Government's import ban on the abortion pill RU486 after a single dose of the drug was seized from a pregnant woman entering the country at Kennedy International Airport last week.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New York said that the Government had violated its own administrative rules by not asking for public comment before determining to prohibit the import of the abortion pill.</p>
        <p>"The imposition of this import ban is arbitrary, capricious, unscientific and a clearly political action," said Simon Heller, a lawyer at the center. "The Bush Administration circumvented the Democratic process to curry favor with a vocal minority."'</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the center said they hoped to use this case as a first step toward bringing the abortion pill to American women. The Government has prevented its import, but more importantly, the manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf of France said it would not seek approval for the drug in the United States until the Government changed its policy and the threat of boycotts or violence by opponents of abortion had decreased. Wide Implications Seen</p>
        <p>Both advocates and opponents of abortion rights agree that the outcome of the dispute could have wide implications for abortion in the United States, especially after last week's Supreme Court decision allowing states to restrict access to abortion.</p>
        <p>Michael Klitsch of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a not-for-profit group which does research on reproductive issues, said, "If things continue the way they are now, with more restrictive laws and a gradually more available drug outside the United States, it is very unfortunate but likely that a black market in RU486 will develop." He said he would prefer that the drug be made available legally.</p>
        <p>In France and England, the pill is popular and it is estimated that more than 110,000 women have used it. It is expected to be available in Sweden and China by next year.</p>
        <p>Groups around the United States are already organizing to obtain the drug, perhaps from China. Other groups have said they will try to manufacture the drug clandestinely in the United States, which they said would require only a medium-size laboratory. Hopes and Fears</p>
        <p>Advocates of abortion rights want women to have access to the drug, which could make abortion more accessible, although a doctor's supervision is required for women taking it. It may also be somewhat safer and cheaper than surgical abortion. Opponents of legal abortion fear that if ending a pregnancy changes from a surgical procedure to the simple taking of some pills, it will make abortion more widespread and make their protests more difficult to carry out.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Europe, where abortion is inexpensive and widely available, 31 percent of women in the United States live in counties without abortion services, said Dr. Jacqueline Forrest of the Guttmacher Institute. Of those who live outside urban areas, 83 percent of women live in counties without any abortion services.</p>
        <p>But that could change with RU486; theoretically, any doctor could prescribe it. The entry of the drug into the country would "greatly expand the number of abortionists, and increase especially the number of abortionists in nonurban areas where until now they have been decreasing," said Dr. Richard Glasow, education director of the National Right to Life Committee in Washington. "This would make it a great deal easier for any doctor to get into the abortion business." Seeking an Injunction</p>
        <p>The debate over the drug flared last Wednesday, when Leona Benten of California was stopped by customs officials after she arrived in New York on a flight from London carrying 12 RU486 pills, which combine for a single 600 milligram dose of the drug, enough for her to end her pregnancy. The customs officials had been alerted that morning by the group that organized Ms. Benten's trip, Abortion Rights Mobilization.</p>
        <p>Ms. Benten was recruited by the group, which had asked sympathetic doctors to identify patients who might be willing to challenge the law. If she is unable to use the RU486, she says she plans to obtain a surgical abortion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Benten and the abortion rights advocates are seeking an injunction to require the Food and Drug Administration and customs officials to return her pills. Further, they seek to have the import ban overturned. Judge Charles P. Sifton of Federal district court in Brooklyn is scheduled to hear arguments from the Government on Friday. The Government has not charged Ms. Benten with any violation for her action.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. allows people to import drugs approved in other countries but not in the United States, as long as they are not in commercial quantities.</p>
        <p>RU486 has been on a list for seizure since 1989. Critics of the Bush Administration, and even some officials of the regulatory agency, say the Administration started the ban to placate opponents of abortion. Safety and Side Effects</p>
        <p>But the agency's official position is that its concern with RU486 arises from the fact that if the drug is used without the supervision of a doctor, it can pose a hazard.</p>
        <p>In a 1990 hearing before the House Committee on Small Business, officials acknowledged that RU486 is a safe drug, but only when it is used in controlled conditions to assure that the possible side effects are monitored.</p>
        <p>RU486 is an antiprogestin that prevents the hormone progesterone from maintaining a pregnancy. It is accompanied two days later by the hormone prostaglandin in pill form. This hormone encourages uterine contractions. Researchers say the drug is a safe and effective method for abortion up to seven to nine weeks after a missed menstrual period.</p>
        <p>Although the drug has fewer risks than surgical abortion, it can cause excessive bleeding. In rare cases women have required a transfusion or even surgery.</p>
        <p>In addition, the prostaglandin drug taken as an adjunct to the RU486 to speed the uterine contractions that flush out the embryo, can in rare cases produce serious side effects like heart attacks, especially among heavy smokers and women with high blood pressure.</p>
