        <p>Performing on a mountain with the rest of this city as a backdrop, Fu Mingxia, the 13-year-old from China who attempts the most difficult dives in the Olympics, led the 12 female qualifiers today in the platform event.</p>
        <p>Because of the extra points Fu amasses as a result of the difficulty of her attempts, she appears to have a clear advantage over second-place Mary Ellen Clark, a 29-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., going into the final on Monday.</p>
        <p>The other American in the event, 29-year-old Ellen Owen, who came out of retirement last year, recovered with a pair of brilliant dives to finish in fifth place after a slow start.</p>
        <p>Yelena Miroshina of the Unified Team was third, and the crowd favorite, Maria Jose Alcala Izguerra of Mexico, was fourth. Views Are Everywhere</p>
        <p>Here on Montjuic, it is as if the diving competition were taking place in the world's largest penthouse. Views are everywhere. The famed Sagrada Familia cathedral, designed by Gaudi, is just off a diver's left shoulder. They see it all, the divers said, as they stand in an open-air arena at the Municipal Pool on the 10-meter platform, as high as a three-story building.</p>
        <p>If the young Chinese was in awe today, it never showed. When she took the gold in last year's world championships, she became the youngest person to capture a world diving title. If she wins Monday, she will be the second-youngest diver to win an Olympic gold medal. (Marjorie Gestring of the United States won the springboard in 1936 at 13 years 9 months.) Fu turns 14 on Aug. 16. 'Dives of the Future'</p>
        <p>"Fu is doing the dives of the future," said Clark's admiring coach, Ron O'Brien. "Years from now, everyone will have to try the more difficult dives just to keep up with her."</p>
        <p>In scoring platform diving, judges award points for takeoff, action in the air and entry. But the scores are multipled by each dive's degree of difficulty.</p>
        <p>Today, the 4-foot-11-inch, 92-pound Fu was soaring at a rate that gave her nine-tenths of a point in difficulty over Clark for each dive. In a sport in which tenths of points are significant, Fu will raise that level to 1.3 in Monday's final, which will not encompass today's scores.</p>
        <p>O'Brien estmated that Fu's advantage in terms of difficulty today was worth about 20 points. Over all, she had a lead of almost 32 points over Clark after today's competition, in which each person had six dives.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Fu's margin could increase by another 35 points. Qualifying Is Goal</p>
        <p>"We told her, 'All we want you to do is qualify,' " said Xu Yiming, a Chinese diving official. As usual, the youngster was not permitted to be interviewed while competition was still under way.</p>
        <p>While Fu's performance hardly was a surprise, Owen's comeback was. She was 24th after four dives. She was 10th after five, in danger of failing to make the final round.</p>
        <p>"I told her to stop being scared," said her coach, Scott Reich. "Stop worrying about points."</p>
        <p>Going into the fifth dive, she did a 3 1/2-twist somersault that earned more points than any other divers except for Fu and Clark. And on her final dive, she also finished third behind the leaders, with a backward, twisting somersault. Clark Steady From Start</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Clark, who sometimes suffers from dizzy spells when she hits the water in an awkward position, was steady from the beginning. Before one backward dive, she stood atop the platform, ankles over the edge, and leaned forward, as still as a car's hood ornament.</p>
        <p>"I never think about what can happen if I land badly," she explained.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, she hoped to qualify for the Olympics, but she suffered a mysterious inner-ear balance problem that apparently resulted from her head hitting the water. "After some dives, I'd swim toward the bottom instead of the top because I didn't know which direction was up," she explained.</p>
