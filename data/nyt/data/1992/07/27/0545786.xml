        <p>The conflict in Bosnia is taking a staggering human toll -- not only in lives lost, but in lives wrenched from their moorings. United Nations officials are already assisting more than two million people who have fled their homes for safer areas. A million more refugees could leave their devastated towns and villages by winter. It is Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.</p>

        <p>The conflict in Bosnia is taking a staggering human toll -- not only in lives lost, but in lives wrenched from their moorings. United Nations officials are already assisting more than two million people who have fled their homes for safer areas. A million more refugees could leave their devastated towns and villages by winter. It is Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.</p>
        <p>To deal with the refugees' plight, United Nations officials have called an urgent meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva this week. The mass exodus cries out for a compassionate, comprehensive response from Bosnia's European neighbors -- and from the United States.</p>
        <p>The murderous struggle among the battered republics of the former Yugoslavia has already claimed more than 20,000 lives. The survivors, meanwhile, must contend with sectarian hatreds and daily danger. Whole towns and villages are being purged of Muslims and Croats as the result of "ethnic cleansing" operations by one side or another. As more and more people seek protection, there are fewer and fewer safe places for them to go within the borders of the former Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that more than 2.5 million people have been driven from their homes. About 1.8 million have found precarious protection within countries of the former federation.</p>
        <p>The crisis is straining the limits of sympathetic response. Croatia, now overwhelmed by more than 600,000 refugees, is shutting its doors. It is unclear how many more refugees the rest of the former federation, including Bosnia, can absorb.</p>
        <p>Most of Europe has been content to sit on the sidelines. The most notable exception is Germany, which has taken in about 200,000 refugees. Hungary, Austria and Sweden combined are sheltering about 150,000.</p>
        <p>Though many European nations are tightening their borders against economic migrants in search of better jobs, the refugees fleeing the former Yugoslavia are political refugees. They are the classic victims of persecution that refugee conventions are designed to protect.</p>
        <p>Their tragedy demands a humanitarian response, but one where the burden is shared fairly. Those unable to find safety in the former Yugoslavia are entitled to temporary safe haven in other lands. The more prosperous nations also need to contribute money to help the refugees. An international appeal for $142 million for the U.N. refugee effort has brought in about $107 million thus far.</p>
        <p>While the heaviest burden falls on Europe, other nations can help. The U.S. Department of Justice, for example, ought to extend temporary safe haven, as allowed under the 1990 Immigration Act, to an estimated 20,000 students and other war-torn area visitors now in this country.</p>
        <p>Europe and the U.S. are understandably fearful that those granted temporary refuge will find some way to stay permanently. But Western powers can't have it both ways. They can't let the communal bloodshed in the Balkans conflict escalate out of control, as they largely have, and then turn their backs on the desperate and dispossessed.</p>
