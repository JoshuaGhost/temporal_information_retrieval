        <p>It is an irony that the modern pentathlon, the one event created by the founder of the modern Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, receives little recognition in the United States.</p>
        <p>Since 1912, the event has been a prestigious one for Europeans, with its unusual combination of riding, swimming, cross-country running, fencing and shooting.</p>
        <p>Even though a fellow named George S. Patton competed, and finished fifth, for the United States 80 years ago (before he became a famous general), it hasn't caught on.</p>
        <p>"In Eastern Europe, they look at the pentathlon as having the greatest athletes," said MIKE GOSTIGIAN, a member of the United States team from Newtown Square, Pa., "I think it makes you the most versatile athlete."</p>
        <p>DOUG STULL of Silver Spring, Md., another American participant, said, referring to his college days: "At Texas, we used to razz the decathletes over who was really the better athlete. We said we were."</p>
        <p>Stull was in third place after the fencing competition yesterday.</p>
