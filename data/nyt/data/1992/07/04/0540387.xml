        <p>Leaders of Nassau and Suffolk counties huddled in separate emergency meetings today, each faced with bankruptcy, huge layoffs and property tax increases after this morning's adjournment of the State Legislature without approval of deficit borrowing plans critical to the finances of both.</p>
        <p>The Republican-controlled Senate voted to approve the multimillion-dollar bailout plans, but the Democratic-controlled Assembly, with backing from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, rejected the borrowing measures. The Democrats demanded that both counties agree to have financial control boards oversee their finances, which have been crippled by lower sales tax revenues and rising social welfare costs with the recession.</p>
        <p>Leaders in the Senate and Assembly said today that a compromise could still be worked out, possibly by the end of next week, even though the Legislature officially adjourned for the summer. County officials said the legislators could be called back to Albany for a special session to reconsider the deficit borrowing measures along with Governor Cuomo's $800 million job-creation bond act, which the Republicans opposed.</p>
        <p>The Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, said this afternoon that he had talked with Governor Cuomo for more than a half hour today, and also talked with leaders of the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Gulotta said he was "confident that when cooler heads prevail, our differences can be worked out." A Call for Sanity</p>
        <p>"It's very clear that at the end of the legislative session, tempers flared on both sides and a number of major issues were not addressed," Mr. Gulotta said. "When calmer minds and reason prevail, we'll be able to resolve these matters."</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert Gaffney, a Republican, met for several hours today with top aides at his offices in Hauppauge, and said he, too, was "confident that state leaders would resolve this issue."</p>
        <p>He said that action by the state was critical for the resolution of Suffolk's "significant cumulative deficit." Unlike Mr. Gulotta, Mr. Gaffney has said that he would accept some state oversight of county finances. Mr. Gulotta indicated today that he was also softening his position, saying that "it was an area that could be negotiated."</p>
        <p>Both counties say that by October if not sooner, they will not have enough money to meet payroll and other expenses. Without relief, property owners in both counties face tax increases between 25 percent and 30 percent and a sharp reduction in police, road maintenance and other services. 'Drop Dead, Long Island'</p>
        <p>Nassau is seeking Albany's approval to borrow $100 million, which would be paid back with a one-percentage point increase in the county's mortgage recording tax. The borrowed money would help close an estimated $159 million deficit in the county's $1.8 billion budget.</p>
        <p>Suffolk wants to borrow up to $91 million, to be paid back, in part, with a half-cent increase in the county sales tax, to 8.5 percent. It needs the money to help fill a $100 million gap in its current $1.3 billion budget.</p>
        <p>"I'm really very much disturbed by the outcome," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., who jousted loudly this morning during the final hours of the session with the Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat.</p>
        <p>Senator Marino described Mr. Weprin's and the Governors' positions as "Drop dead, Long Island."</p>
        <p>"I don't understand it," Mr. Marino said, calling the demand for oversight "totally unnecessary."</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo blamed Mr. Marino for the outcome and said he did not know whether a special session would be called.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Marino left Albany and said he wasn't coming back," the Governor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weprin, the Assembly Speaker, said the door was still open if an agreement could be reached.</p>
        <p>The Nassau County Comptroller, Peter King, a Republican, said Albany Democrats were playing partisan politics to embarrass Mr. Gulotta and other Nassau Republicans. Mr. Gulotta is up for re-election next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said that "if necessary, the county would go for some kind of a financial control board."</p>
        <p>Benjamin Zwirn, a Democrat and Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, said he hoped the bailout proposal "was good and dead."</p>
        <p>"The real issue is cutting government spending." he said. "The threat of a tax increase is just a scare tactic.  The Republicans use it all the time to get their way."</p>
