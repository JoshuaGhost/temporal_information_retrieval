        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a member of my high school's honors class in English, I am replying to "For Students, Steinbeck and Orwell Can't Match Cliffs Notes" (letter, June 14) by William C. Clayton, a high school English teacher. The English curriculum in most schools is similar to those of 30 years ago, and yet what is expected of young people has changed. This school year we had to read close to 30 books, plays, short stories and poems. We were given a quiz almost every other day.</p>
        <p>Many of the people in my class, including me, purchased Cliffs Notes and Monarch Notes because how can it be expected that we will understand the symbolism in four chapters of "The Scarlet Letter" in two days? Cliffs Notes are essential for good grades in quizzes and tests these days because students are forced to learn faster and are under more pressure to get those good grades to get into a good college.</p>

        <p>As a member of my high school's honors class in English, I am replying to "For Students, Steinbeck and Orwell Can't Match Cliffs Notes" (letter, June 14) by William C. Clayton, a high school English teacher. The English curriculum in most schools is similar to those of 30 years ago, and yet what is expected of young people has changed. This school year we had to read close to 30 books, plays, short stories and poems. We were given a quiz almost every other day.</p>
        <p>Many of the people in my class, including me, purchased Cliffs Notes and Monarch Notes because how can it be expected that we will understand the symbolism in four chapters of "The Scarlet Letter" in two days? Cliffs Notes are essential for good grades in quizzes and tests these days because students are forced to learn faster and are under more pressure to get those good grades to get into a good college.</p>
        <p>On top of that, New York State has a crucial Regents exam in English for juniors, and it is essential that we get through all the books assigned, for which Cliffs Notes are very helpful. Mr. Clayton states that resorting to outlines is also an epidemic in his advanced-placement classes. I would expect that in such a challenging class outlines are a necessity, to understand the literary work and to pass as well.</p>
        <p>I am not praising Cliffs Notes or Monarch Notes, but the pressure in any curriculum these day is enormous. Sometimes we had only one weekend to finish a book, and in other instances only a week to read such classics as "To Kill a Mockingbird."</p>
        <p>School, in my opinion is more of a hurry and scurry than in previous generations. There is more to learn, less time, more pressure, more challenges. These days there is just not enough time, which is why Cliffs Notes sell out faster than concert tickets. They are justifiable and certainly needed. AMY WU Thornwood, N.Y., June 16, 1992</p>
