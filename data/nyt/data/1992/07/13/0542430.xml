        <p>Many cable television channels think they have found the answer to an uncertain future: children.</p>
        <p>Executives with several cable programming companies, including Turner, Nickelodeon and Discovery, said in interviews here that children's shows were becoming much more important for cable. Each company has plans to expand its appeal to children, specifically aiming to lure children away from the broadcast networks' prime-time shows.</p>
        <p>Children are important, the cable executives say, because it is vital to establish early brand loyalty in a competitive television environment that may encompass up to 300 channels in the near future, up from roughly 50 now. Moreover, the executives have concluded that children have more influence than ever on the spending habits of their parents. Hot New Cartoons</p>
        <p>Next month, Nickelodeon, the children's cable channel, which has been limited to the daytime, will move into prime time on Saturday nights with a block of four children's shows, including its hottest new cartoon series, "The Ren and Stimpy Show."</p>
        <p>Next fall, Turner Broadcasting will start the Cartoon Network, made up entirely of animated shows aimed at children, including "The Flintstones" and Bugs Bunny cartoons.</p>
        <p>And sometime next year, the two Discovery Networks -- the Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel -- will for the first time fashion blocks of documentaries, nature programs and other informational programming aimed at children.</p>
        <p>"The world is changing," said Geraldine Laybourne, the president of Nickelodeon. "Television in 10 years will have a far different landscape. We have to reinforce these extremely strong trademarks." Building 'Brand Equity'</p>
        <p>Chris Moseley, senior vice president of marketing for Discovery Networks, said cable channels were trying to build "brand equity."</p>
        <p>"Everybody is trying to solidify what a channel means to the consumer," she said.</p>
        <p>The biggest reason why children are more and more the favored consumers among many cable executives is that they are increasingly being perceived as having access to deep pockets -- even if those pockets are not their own.</p>
        <p>"The kids' business has been a rapidly growing business over the last couple of years," said Scott Sassa, president of the Turner Entertainment Networks. "We see that there's still a lot more head room."</p>
        <p>Indeed, the market for advertising directed at children viewers has been the strongest in the television business. The so-called "up front" market for children's shows -- in which advertisers buy commercial time in advance of a new season -- sold out in two days this spring.</p>
        <p>"The children's market is the only strong market at the moment," said Jon Mandel, senior vice president of Grey Advertising. He said the children's advertising market had grown by about 25 percent this year, to a total of $500 million.</p>
        <p>"That's a thin market in an $11 billion industry," he said. "But there's never been as much money in the children's marketplace."</p>
        <p>The willingness of advertisers to buy into almost all types of children's programming is being fed by several factors and led by an increase in the amount of money either controlled by children or being spent on them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandel said more new products were being pitched to children, including athletic shoes and meals at restaurants like Pizza Hut.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moseley said baby-boomer parents tended to be lavish in their spending on their children. "They're spending more on their kids than on themselves," she said. Renewable Audience</p>
        <p>The other advantages of plugging into children's shows, Ms. Laybourne said, are that the market can be stretched to reach older children, and that it is renewable because new children are added every year.</p>
        <p>A principal goal of Nickelodeon's Saturday night lineup, which will begin Aug. 15, is to reach what are known as "tweens" -- usually defined as children 9 to 14 years old. Thus, Nickelodeon will rely on "Ren and Stimpy," a cartoon about the fractious adventures of an offbeat dog-and-cat team, which has become a cult hit with young viewers and even some adults, as well as its most successful "tween" attraction to date.</p>
        <p>Nickelodeon has also added "Clarissa Explains It All," in which a young teen-ager analyzes her family's behavior, as well as "Roundhouse," a musical variety show, and "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" -- to add a little scare to the evening.</p>
        <p>The idea behind moving children's shows into Saturday night, where Nickelodeon had previously run repeats of old network situation comedies, is to fill a void left by the broadcast networks, which have not tried in recent years to attract children on Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Turner executives believe the Cartoon Network can steal away children from the networks on other nights of prime time.</p>
        <p>"The Cartoon Network is just a great idea," Mr. Mandel said. "There has been nothing for a kid to watch between 8 and 10 in the evening." Shift in Viewers</p>
        <p>Ms. Laybourne said Nickelodeon's success had helped change children's television. In the late 1970's, she said, network cartoons on Saturday morning accounted for 60 percent of all children's viewing. This year, it is down to 14 percent. Meanwhile, Nickelodeon alone accounts for 30 percent of children's viewing.</p>
        <p>That means more children's advertising dollars are flowing into Nickelodeon and other alternatives to network shows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandel said the trend might continue. "There really is a growing recognition that kids have a lot of input into what gets purchased in this country," he said.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS</p>
