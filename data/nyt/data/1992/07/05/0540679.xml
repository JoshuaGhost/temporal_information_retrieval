        <p>STILL reeling from one of the most acrimonious budget battles in the state's history, lawmakers of both parties say they are experiencing unprecedented expressions of public anger and hostility.</p>
        <p>Massive letter-writing campaigns, harassing phone calls to their homes and even occasional anonymous death threats have left many legislators shocked and sometimes intimidated by the vociferous nature of politics in New Jersey today.</p>
        <p>And while the continuing battles over such issues as the death penalty, assault weapons and the state budget have intensified the problem, some lawmakers and political experts say the increase in hostility has been mounting for several years.</p>
        <p>Even relationships among legislative colleagues have become strained as veteran lawmakers denounce a shift toward increased partisanship that is underscored, at times, by personal attacks among the lawmakers themselves.</p>
        <p>"What I sense now is a tremendous lack of respect for elected officials in general," said Assemblyman Robert W. Singer, Republican of Lakewood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer, who has been in the Legislature for 12 years, said he had seen a marked change in attitude toward lawmakers over the last few years.</p>
        <p>"People are hostile now," he said.  "In the last couple of years, I've been insulted more than ever before."</p>
        <p>Alan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said Mr. Singer's perception of increasing citizen anger was "absolutely correct."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenthal attributed the change, in part, to increased public awareness of legislators' positions on controversial issues and a growing number of single-issue special-interest groups endorsing sometimes inflexible agendas.</p>
        <p>"Nobody in public office is very popular," Mr. Rosenthal said. "And to be an incumbent is be pilloried."</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer recalled driving along a highway when another car pulled up beside his, and its occupants made obscene gestures at him. He told of another incident, when four legislators in a car were sprayed with water guns by passengers in another car. Identified by License Plates</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer attributed both incidents to the fact that his car had special license plates identifying him as a state legislator.</p>
        <p>"Today it's a disadvantage to have legislative plates," he said. "Many legislators are taking them off because they just don't want the hassle."</p>
        <p>Senator Andrew R. Ciesla, Republican of Brick, experienced his first run-in with public anger just a few months into his legislative career, which began in January. On a local radio call-in show, he said, he indicated that he was not yet prepared to take a position on whether Garden State Parkway tolls should be eliminated. After that, Mr. Ciesla said, the show's host "had some very unkind things to say" about him and encouraged listeners to call the legislator at home.  'Downright Crass' Comments</p>
        <p>That night, his family was besieged with calls. "I was surprised by the anger that people had," Mr. Ciesla said. "They were not only very pointed in their comments, but many of them were downright crass."</p>
        <p>Recently, Assemblyman John E. Rooney, Republican of Northvale, who is chairman of the Assembly Energy and Solid Waste Committee,scheduled hearings on a bill that was opposed by public utility workers and their union. On the day of the hearing, the workers gathered in the street between the State House and the Legislative Office Building, where the meeting was to be held. Mr. Rooney, who had to cross the street to get to the meeting, came face to face with the protesters.</p>
        <p>"It was like running a gantlet," he said, referring to the fact that the protesters had formed a narrow lane for him to pass through. "They were chanting obscenities; it was nasty, really nasty. It has an effect on you when three or four hundred people are screaming at you."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney said he was particularly upset when one of the protesters spit at him as he entered the office building.</p>
        <p>Assemblywoman Clare M. Farragher, Republican of Freehold Township, who was present at the time, said she was shocked by the outpouring of hostility toward Mr. Rooney.</p>
        <p>"These guys scared the heck out of me," Mrs. Farragher said. "It was spooky." Message Was a Death Threat</p>
        <p>Mrs. Farragher, who has been in the Legislature since 1987, said that about three years ago she received a death threat on the answering machine in her office.</p>
        <p>"It might have been a prank, but I was frightened," she said. "You just don't know who's going to take offense at what."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rooney said he had also received a death threat at his legislative office, along with an obscene message on his answering machine at home. The police were able to trace the obscene call, Mr. Rooney said, and the person who made it is now being prosecuted. The death threat, however, could not be traced.</p>
        <p>"The women in my office were really upset about this," he said.  "They came in and found a message on the machine that someone was going to come in and machine-gun the whole office. You don't get paid enough to take that kind of abuse." Effect on Staff Members</p>
        <p>In fact, it is a legislator's office staff that often takes the brunt of much of the public's anger.</p>
        <p>Senator Matthew Feldman, Democrat of Teaneck, said his office had received hundreds of letters and telephone calls about the current budget crisis. All those calls and letters go through Mr. Feldman's chief of staff, Judy Kohl.</p>
        <p>"It ruffles my dignity when they become nasty and use four-letter words," Ms. Kohl said. "They have no right to do that. Even though we are their servants, even a servant should be treated with dignity."</p>
        <p>The increase in hostility also extends to relationships between legislators.</p>
        <p>"I've noticed that some of the freshman legislators think that to be belligerent to other members is O.K.," Assemblyman Singer said.  "When they get up and make disparaging remarks against Democrats, that's not what we're there for. That lack of respect for each other is why the public has a lack of respect for us."</p>
        <p>He added that the barbs traded on the Senate and Assembly floors were not necessarily confined to exchanges between members of opposite parties.</p>
        <p>Recently, for example, during a debate on an education-related bill in the Assembly, one Republican legislator publicly chided a Republican colleague for conferring with a lobbyist who was improperly present in the Assembly chambers.</p>
        <p>"People are doing things today that they've never done before," Mr. Singer said of the incident. Becoming More Partisan</p>
        <p>Many legislators also say that the political battles in the Legislature are becoming more acrimonious because the legislators themselves have become more partisan and, as a result, more polarized.</p>
        <p>"It's not the same as it used to be," said Senator John H. Ewing, Republican of Bedminster. "The camaraderie is gone; it's more individualistic and party against party."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ewing, who has been in the Legislature since 1967, said the increase in partisanship had deprived legislators of the opportunity to get to know their opposite-party colleagues on a personal level.</p>
        <p>"In the old days, we'd argue about things on the Senate floor and then be over in Lorenzo's having dinner together," he said, referring to legislators' custom of retiring to a restaurant near the State House after legislative sessions.</p>
        <p>Those dinners, Mr. Ewing said, often provided an opportunity for legislators to iron out differences on issues and arrive at political compromises.</p>
        <p>"I don't know what happened, but it's changed," he said.  Loss of Confidence Seen</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenthal said that being a legislator "isn't fun anymore and it's becoming more mean-spirited." Part of the reason, he said, is that people have lost confidence in their elected officials.</p>
        <p>The legislators, Mr. Rosenthal said, are also being subjected to more intense pressure because the public has become more aware of the political process and of important issues. At the same time, he said, there are more special-interest groups than ever before, and, given their very narrow agendas, those groups are less willing to compromise on the issues they are interested in.</p>
        <p>"You're either with them or you're condemned to purgatory," Mr. Rosenthal said. "Abortion, gun control, racial and ethnic issues cut that way.  Legislators are dealing with single-issue groups that don't give up much space. That makes it tough."</p>
        <p>The state's political parties have also become more single-minded and wedded to their agenda, he said, adding: "It's becoming nastier. It's a blood sport with no holds barred."</p>
