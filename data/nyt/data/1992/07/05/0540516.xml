        <p>As a Peace Corps volunteer in the kingdom of Tonga (1976-78), I can attest to the dead-on accuracy of Paul Theroux's impressions of this wacky country ("In the Court of the King of Tonga," June 7).</p>
        <p>While there, I wrote a travel piece for The Los Angeles Times, in which I described the King's beautiful daughter as "pleasantly plump." I was called on the red carpet and ordered to write a letter of apology.</p>

        <p>It was confusing. In Tonga, zaftig is beautiful. I myself enjoyed attention for the "beauty" of my stocky, peasant thighs, for the first and only time in my life. But perhaps the Princess was only too aware of the bony standards of the rest of the world. JAN WORTH RENDLEMAN</p>
