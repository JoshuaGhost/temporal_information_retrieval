        <p>If they're dancing like mad on Broadway this summer, it is thanks to four musicals that have checked in with trunks full of choreography and decided to stay. "Crazy for You," "Jelly's Last Jam" and two Frank Loesser revivals, "Guys and Dolls" and "The Most Happy Fella," are widely dissimilar, but they give show dancing a pride of place through a freshness, even sassiness, that theatergoers have not seen in years.</p>
        <p>This happy state stems largely from a new look at the so-called integrated musical, with its historic disdain for set pieces outside the narrative framework. Dance is back up front in these productions where, in show-business parlance, it "carries the story forward": It is equal to the dialogue and the songs, not subordinate to music as in so many of Broadway's British imports.</p>

        <p>If they're dancing like mad on Broadway this summer, it is thanks to four musicals that have checked in with trunks full of choreography and decided to stay. "Crazy for You," "Jelly's Last Jam" and two Frank Loesser revivals, "Guys and Dolls" and "The Most Happy Fella," are widely dissimilar, but they give show dancing a pride of place through a freshness, even sassiness, that theatergoers have not seen in years.</p>
        <p>This happy state stems largely from a new look at the so-called integrated musical, with its historic disdain for set pieces outside the narrative framework. Dance is back up front in these productions where, in show-business parlance, it "carries the story forward": It is equal to the dialogue and the songs, not subordinate to music as in so many of Broadway's British imports.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the excitement, the season has seen no breakthrough choreography with a signature style that is very much about today. Don't look, for instance, for a "West Side Story," in which Jerome Robbins and Peter Gennaro so powerfully dramatized the street tensions and Latin rhythms of 1957 that the choreography's finger-snapping and mambos symbolized the musical's own era.</p>
        <p>The four recent productions, by contrast, are all set in the past and the result, suddenly, is that pastiche choreography reigns supreme on Broadway. Each of these shows is filled with commentaries upon period references. The range stretches from the 1920's ("The Most Happy Fella") through the 1930's ("Crazy for You" and "Jelly's Last Jam") to the 1940's ("Guys and Dolls"). But -- and this is the sole virtue of any pastiche -- there is always the possibility of an inventive gloss upon the model.</p>
        <p>It may be hard to define a personal trademark for a choreographer whose main assignment is to make allusions to earlier social dances and conventions. But the current crop on Broadway has for the most part handled this retro genre with the necessary stylization, even originality.</p>
        <p>"Jelly's Last Jam" is the most creative in this respect. As choreographer, Hope Clarke weaves a showcase anthology of social dances, rituals and a range of modern-dance and jazz idioms with astonishing effectiveness through what is quite simply a great</p>
        <p>dance</p>
        <p>show. George C. Wolfe's harsh meditation upon the life of the jazz composer Jelly Roll Morton makes "Jelly's Last Jam" distinct from the other musicals. It reaches beyond entertainment with a polemical focus on the idea that Morton's music grew out of a black heritage that he denied.</p>
        <p>And yet with Gregory Hines as its star, "Jelly's Last Jam" signals the return of the superb all-round entertainer who is a dancer first. With all due respect to Tommy Tune, anyone who grew up on Ray Bolger in "Where's Charley?" can remember Bolger as the last of the sensational eccentric dancers (a vaudeville term for especially agile hoofers). Mr. Hines and Savion Glover, who portrays the young Morton and is still an astounding teen-age prodigy at 18, are fantastic tap dancers in the same tradition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hines and Ted L. Levy are credited with the choreography for the tap numbers, but "Jelly" is not a tap musical. Nor is it a revue in disguise, like some of the shows choreographed by Mr. Tune, who did the most to keep dancing alive on Broadway during the 1980's. The dance antecedents in "Jelly's Last Jam" rest rather in the work of Ms. Clarke's mentors: Alvin Ailey and Katherine Dunham, even Martha Graham.</p>
        <p>"To Bird -- With Love," Ailey's brilliant 1985 modern-dance piece about the angst of another jazz legend, Charles (Bird) Parker, comes immediately to mind. The similarity in images is striking. Even the strutting figure in top hat and tails that shadows the Parker character has its counterpart in the Chimney Man (played by Keith David), Morton's ghostly guide in "Jelly's Last Jam." The structure of "Jelly's Last Jam" is pure Graham. The Chimney Man is also comparable to the Messenger of Death in her 1958 "Clytemnestra." There, as in "Jelly," a protagonist finds redemption in self-understanding -- by being guided through the nether world to relive the past.</p>
        <p>The movement idioms and dance images, however, have other inspirations: the slinky barrelhouse numbers and voodoo folk processionals that Katherine Dunham choreographed over the decades, beginning in the 1930's, and the jazz-dance choreography that Louis Johnson and Alvin Ailey have made so dramatically expressive.</p>
        <p>A debt of this sort does not detract from the brassy originality with which Ms. Clarke handles her material. She gives the lowlife scenes a cheerful bawdiness that is new to Broadway. When Mr. David, as Morton's conscience, and Mr. Hines arise from the dead and come down a ramp, they are attended by three self-mocking and hip-gyrating furies (Graham again!) called Hunnies. Hell is an all-purpose speak-easy. Transformed at one point into a New Orleans bordello, it is where Mr. Hines and Mr. Glover have a challenge duet, using a tap dance convention on at least two levels: to show the difference in their styles (powerful, flat-soled rhythms for Mr. Hines, lighter and faster percussion for Mr. Glover) and also to move the plot along.</p>
        <p>Drama is embodied more powerfully in the minstrel-show performers that embody a self-reproach when Morton hurls a racial insult at his best friend; Mr. Hines has a tap solo in front as a class act, but the denigrating image in the background is a haunting one. Whether Morton's auto-critique is convincing by the time he enters his sarcophagus (they bury folks above the bayou), the dances certainly are.</p>
        <p>It is no accident that this year's Tony for best choreography went to Susan Stroman. Her work in "Crazy for You" epitomizes the most clever use of pastiche, making the style of a show its content. Assigned a string of Gershwin songs rather than a credible plot, she was asked to comment on show-business conventions of the 1930's and has done so with resonant echoes of Broadway and Hollywood musicals. But while an unexpected context may give a twist to the familiar lyrics in the show, Ms. Stroman's choreography is straightforward rather than askew.</p>
        <p>It delights in its squareness -- the unity of a tap-dancing chorus line, the earnestness in a soft-shoe challenge duet, the ballroom apotheosis for the romantic leads, Bobby and Polly, and the Wild West folk bravado that derives from more complex originals like Michael Kidd's dances in the 1954 film "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."</p>
        <p>Ms. Stroman's gift here is for the instant image. Never given time to develop character, she delineates by using different dance idioms to dramatic purpose. Bobby, who dreams of starring in a musical, is defined immediately through the fantasy chorus line that pops out of a single limousine and becomes his backup group. As a tap dancer, Harry Groener, who portrays Bobby, has gone pretty much unsung: He has a quicksilver agility and controlled nonchalance that Ms. Stroman also uses to acrobatic effect, in the saloon scenes in Deadrock, Nev., where Bobby gets his girl.</p>
        <p>For her big production numbers, Ms. Stroman turns to time-honored genres: vaudeville routines with props (dances on pans), work dances with pickaxes and ritual stick dances. The mirror dance between Bobby and Zangler, the Ziegfeld-like impresario, is a 19th-century device nicely renewed.</p>
        <p>Any doubt that dance is important in this production is quashed by its big in-joke: Like Serge Diaghilev, the founder of the Ballets Russes who was nicknamed Chinchilla, Zangler has a white streak in his hair.</p>
        <p>Dance, by contrast, is not dominant in Loesser's "Most Happy Fella," but it enriches the atmosphere. The revival, presented in the composer's two-piano arrangement, wears its gentle regional-theater origins (the Goodspeed Opera House) on its sleeve. Liza Gennaro (daughter of Peter) has had to keep her choreography unobtrusive but not invisible, a task she accomplishes with workmanlike charm.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gennaro knows how to distill patterns and ethnic forms: There are ersatz folk dances for the Italian farm workers and miniature square dances in the "Big D" number through which Cleo (Liz Larsen) and Herman (Scott Waara) discover they both hail from Dallas.</p>
        <p>"Guys and Dolls," the other Loesser revival, dazzles with its ultimate professionalism on all fronts. Only Americans can execute the kind of exhilarating dancing in musicals that Christopher Chadman restores to Broadway with his show-stopping choreography in the "Crapshooters' Dance."</p>
        <p>His "Havana" number for Latin couples has the right steaminess -- pelvis-popping pairs engaged in sexy lifts. Gary Chryst is notable here for his suave stylishness, just as Scott Wise's acrobatic bravura is a metaphor for gambling fever in the "Crapshooters' " number. Mr. Chadman renders a true homage to musicals of the 1950's: He re-stylizes material that could look dated and gives it the accelerated energy of the television age, not Howdy Doody time but MTV.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the choreography lacks a certain character, consisting of identifiable ballet steps that look simple by today's standards for virtuoso dancers. This is ballet for people who don't go to the ballet.</p>
        <p>Broadway needs to give its dancers more of a challenge. Last fall, a chorus member from "The Will Rogers Follies" made a telling point in Dance Magazine: Today's professional dancers are so highly trained, she said, that they feel "overqualified for Broadway." The current shows suggest that Broadway choreography could -- and should -- do better.</p>
