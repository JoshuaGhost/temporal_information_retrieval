        <p>For four years, the Unisys Corporation, a computer manufacturer, operated a research-and-development division out of a 78,000-square-foot building on 90 acres in Flanders, N.J. Last year, however, it left the site, and Benjamin Moore &amp; Co., a leading paint manufacturer, bought it for $3.5 million. Last month it began altering the building to make it into a state-of-the-art technical and administrative center.</p>
        <p>About 120 employees will use the new facility, which will house the company's central laboratories and data processing and engineering departments. It will also have a model store for sales training and a "paint farm" where paints are tested under actual weather conditions. The company, based in Newark, anticipates spending $42 million on the changes.</p>

        <p>"The growth of these organizations, along with our desire to create a corporate training center, called for a central facility which could accommodate several interrelated departments," said Benjamin Belcher Jr., executive vice president of Moore.</p>
        <p>The project has been designed by the architectural firm of Adler, Goodman Kalish of Great Neck, L.I.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 12, 1992, Sunday</p>
        <p>A report in the Postings column last Sunday about renovation for a new Benjamin Moore paint center in Flanders, N.J., misstated its cost and the location of the company's headquarters. The renovation will cost $2 million, not $42 million. The headquarters is in Montvale, N.J., not Newark.</p>
