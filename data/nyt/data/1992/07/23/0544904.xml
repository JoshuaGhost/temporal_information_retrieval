        <p>Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates declined yesterday, as credit market participants were encouraged by comments from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that suggested the Fed remained vigilant in the fight against inflation.</p>
        <p>In response to a question during his appearance before a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan suggested that in coming years the Fed might lower its money supply growth targets.</p>
        <p>Answering a question about money supply from Stephen L. Neal, a Democratic Congressman from North Carolina, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed's Open Market Committee was "generally in agreement that we have to bring the ranges down another notch to conform to our long-term goal of price stability."  'Anti-Inflation Bias'</p>
        <p>Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America, said Mr. Greenspan's comments "suggest to me there is still a very strong anti-inflation bias at the Fed."</p>
        <p>"Even though Mr. Greenspan has admitted there is a breakdown between money growth and economic activity," he added, "there still seems to be enough of a connection between money and inflation to keep going."</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Greenspan's comments, prices of Treasury securities also benefited from a further decline in stock prices abroad and in the United States, as well as from rumors that the Fed was selling short- to intermediate-term issues and buying bonds for a customer. Traders said the purchaser was rumored to be the German central bank.</p>
        <p>"I don't know who is doing it, but someone is giving the long end a nice bid," a government-securities trader said. "And with the yield spread between two-year notes and bonds at 3.40 percentage points, there is a good reason to buy bonds."</p>
        <p>In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Greenspan said that "long rates have a good way to go down if inflation expectations could be purged from the system."</p>
        <p>In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 29 1/2-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 1/2, up 18/32, to yield 7.61 percent, compared with 7.65 percent late Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Among Treasury note issues outstanding, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 23/32, up 10/32, to yield 6.83 percent. And the 5 7/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 10 33/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 4.68 percent.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon the Treasury announced it would sell $15 billion of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $10.5 billion at an auction on Wednesday. The size of the auctions is unchanged from June.</p>
        <p>In when-issued trading after the announcement, the new two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 4.30 percent, while the new five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.78 percent.</p>
        <p>Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell, as the further decline in stock prices persuaded some investors to seek haven in safe short-term debt instruments.</p>
        <p>Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.15 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.22 percent.</p>
        <p>New-issue activity accelerated in the corporate bond market.</p>
        <p>Among the issuers was Ralph's Grocery Company, which priced $300 million of 10-year high-yield securities through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The 10 1/4 percent notes, which are noncallable for five years, were priced at $100, or par.</p>
        <p>The issue is rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service and B- by the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
        <p>In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Merrill Lynch acted as lead manager for an offering of $300 million worth of 30-year debentures for the Province of Nova Scotia. Tax-Exempt Rally</p>
        <p>The 8 1/4 percent noncallable debentures were priced at $98.20, to yield 8.415 percent, 77 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.</p>
        <p>The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A- by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>The rally in the Treasury market spilled over into the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds.</p>
        <p>Traders said that prices of most widely quoted securities improved by 3/8 point in fairly active trading.</p>
        <p>"The market is in very good shape," a municipal securities trader said. "At the moment there are not enough bonds around, and there is too much money."</p>
