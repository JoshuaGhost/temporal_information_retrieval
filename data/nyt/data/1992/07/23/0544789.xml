        <p>The United States Trustee's Office, a unit of the Justice Department, has asked a bankruptcy court to replace the principals of Braniff International Airlines with a court-appointed trustee to oversee the disposition of Braniff's assets. The carrier, which abruptly suspended operations July 2, had operated under Chapter 11 since last August.</p>
        <p>Charging there was gross mismanagement of Braniff, the trustee's office filed its request on Monday with Federal Bankruptcy Judge Cecelia Goetz in Hauppauge, L.I. Judge Goetz signed a temporary restraining order barring Jeffrey Chodorow and Arthur Cohen, the airline's principal owners, from removing any of the carrier's records, equipment or money. They were also ordered to bring Braniff's airline operating certificate to a hearing scheduled on Tuesday in Hauppauge.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
