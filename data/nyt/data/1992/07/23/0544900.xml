        <p>Magic Johnson said yesterday that he would end his lengthy endorsement relationship with Converse Inc., citing dissatisfaction with the athletic shoe company's advertising and marketing strategies.</p>
        <p>"Converse is still living in the 1960's and 70's," Mr. Johnson told The Associated Press in Monte Carlo, following a practice session of the United States Olympic basketball team. "They haven't arrived in the 80's and 90's, where advertising and marketing are the keys."</p>

        <p>Magic Johnson said yesterday that he would end his lengthy endorsement relationship with Converse Inc., citing dissatisfaction with the athletic shoe company's advertising and marketing strategies.</p>
        <p>"Converse is still living in the 1960's and 70's," Mr. Johnson told The Associated Press in Monte Carlo, following a practice session of the United States Olympic basketball team. "They haven't arrived in the 80's and 90's, where advertising and marketing are the keys."</p>
        <p>The remarks of Mr. Johnson, who has endorsed Converse since 1979, were met with a strongly worded statement from Gib Ford, Converse's president in North Reading, Mass., who said the superstar player's contract with his company would run through August 1994.</p>
        <p>The remarks "came as both a surprise and shock to us," Mr. Ford said, adding that Converse was "the first of Magic's sponsors to announce our continued support of him when he announced he was HIV positive in November 1991."</p>
        <p>Lon Rosen, Mr. Johnson's agent, said in a telephone interview yesterday that Converse "should not have been surprised" at his client's remarks, because "I've discussed this with Converse."</p>
        <p>"They have supported him," Mr. Rosen added, "but they haven't supported him in terms of marketing over the years." He said that he and Mr. Johnson would like Converse to terminate the contract.</p>
        <p>Liz Dolan, a spokeswoman for Nike Inc., said her company "would always be interested in a guy that great." And Bernadette Mansur, a spokeswoman for Reebok International Ltd., said that if Mr. Johnson were not under contract, "we would certainly entertain speaking to Magic."</p>
        <p>In The Associated Press report, Mr. Johnson said Larry Bird, an Olympic teammate, felt the same way about his relationship with Converse. But Mr. Ford said Mr. Bird had "stated that his remarks had been taken out of context."  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
