        <p>Saddam Hussein's defiance of U.N. inspection rights in Iraq has put George Bush out on the shakiest limb of his Presidency.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush does nothing and allows Saddam to get away with violating U.N. cease-fire terms, he calls his foreign policy leadership into question and mocks his own finest hour, the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>If he takes military action, he still might not be able to force Saddam into submission and risks charges of playing campaign politics with lives.</p>
        <p>President Bush wants to do the right thing, namely deliver a convincing military blow against Iraq. But he is having an extremely difficult time figuring out what blows would be convincing, gathering allies to participate and gaining support from the U.N. Security Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush finds himself in one quandary after another. He knows that any force he uses must be consequential, that is, cause serious hardship for Saddam. But if it is big enough to be consequential, it may be too big to garner allied and U.N. backing. And if it is small enough to satisfy most allies and the U.N., it is not likely to be big enough to be consequential.</p>
        <p>Saddam is not making Mr. Bush's task easier. Last September he stupidly refused U.N. inspectors entry into an important weapons facility. After a confrontation, he backed down. This time, he more cleverly made his stand against the inspectors searching for military documents in the Agriculture Ministry.</p>
        <p>He probably calculates that he can get away with such a seemingly insignificant slight. And he certainly draws comfort from Mr. Bush's fall in popularity. What better time to challenge the gulf war victors?</p>
        <p>Or what worse time? For as the Presidential elections approach, Mr. Bush simply cannot afford to do nothing. His problem, rather, is to divine the possible and sensible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's first step was to show Americans a pattern of Iraqi violations on top of Saddam's defiance at the Agriculture Ministry. The State Department did so recently by detailing a continuing pattern of violations: refusing to join Iraq-Kuwait border talks, terrorizing relief workers in northern Iraq and rejecting U.N.-mandated plans for paying war reparations with Iraqi oil exports.</p>
        <p>The second step, extracting attack plans from the Pentagon, is turning into a big problem. Pentagon officials and the Joint Chiefs are reluctant to use force and say they cannot come up with targets that promise good odds of forcing Saddam to his knees. But that goal goes beyond sending the necessary tough political message and defines the problem in a way it cannot be solved. It thus argues for inaction or guarantees failure.</p>
        <p>Which is why step three, getting the allies on board, compounds Mr. Bush's woes. The Saudis will join the attack, but only if it is massive and offers a reasonable chance to break Saddam's will. The British and French will add their bombers, but only if the attack is limited.</p>
        <p>Step four, gaining U.N. Security Council support, is proving equally elusive. The Russians are fence-sitting, and no one will bother approaching the Chinese -- whose neutrality is once again hoped for -- until everyone else is lined up. Other Council members have been lukewarm, and Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has not tipped his hand.</p>
        <p>Another holdup is whether to seek a new Council resolution authorizing military action. Some even believe it is legally required for anything other than a limited attack.</p>
        <p>The key to breaking this logjam is to focus sharply on the stakes for the U.N. If the U.N. cannot bend Saddam to its will now, all hope vanishes of establishing this body as a force for peace and peacekeeping. If the U.N. cannot meet the test in Iraq, where war was "won," it will have no credibility and authority anywhere.</p>
        <p>From this prime principle, it follows that the U.N. must act and that its means must be sufficient to its ends. Allied military planners have to see their task not in narrow military terms, or in terms of breaking Saddam's will or deposing him, but strategically -- to prove that defying the U.N. comes at a high price. Key allies must agree on military measures necessary to send a message of resolve. The Security Council has to enforce its own resolutions. Anything less would be a disaster for George Bush and the U.N.</p>
