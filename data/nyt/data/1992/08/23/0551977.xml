        <p>One of the oldest community development corporations in New York City, Hope Community Inc., has opened a 30-unit affordable housing complex called Hope Place at 415 East 115th Street in East Harlem.</p>
        <p>The development is an important phase in a community-planned strategy to revitalize 115th Street between First and Pleasant Avenues. Thus far, three buildings with 62 units have been completed by the 24-year-old organization, each with the help of more than $500,000 in low-interest loans and grants from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, as well as $1.1 million in equity from the New York Equity Fund.</p>
        <p>"This is one more thing on a whole block that is turning around," said Joan Lebow, a spokesperson for the Local Initiatives entity.</p>
