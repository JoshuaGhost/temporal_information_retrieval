        <p>Japan's Minister of Finance put his finger in the dike last week, announcing measures to discourage banks from dumping shares into the cratering stock market. The move was cheered as a step away from financial panic. But far more is needed to contain the flood.</p>
        <p>Like their American counterparts, Japanese banks are sitting on humongous losses in commercial real estate. And to raise money for dividends, they have been tempted to sell securities bought for a song before the market peaked in 1989.</p>
        <p>But with stocks already down by three-fifths -- some $3 trillion -- and the economy sputtering toward recession, the Government is eager to halt the vicious cycle in which the banks' rush to liquidity tightens the noose on businesses already lacking cash. Under the new rules, banks are allowed to pay dividends without showing profits. And as long as they hang onto stocks that have fallen in value, they can avoid revealing the losses on their balance sheets.</p>
        <p>This is a palliative, everyone agrees, not a cure for what ails the over-extended Japanese financial system. Indeed, it smacks of the desperate efforts in the mid-1980's to postpone the day of reckoning for America's savings and loans.</p>
        <p>What could make a real difference, though, is a stiff dose of public spending that generates jobs and profits. Just such a $25 billion to $50 billion package was promised at the Munich economic summit in July and is expected to be proposed formally within weeks.</p>
