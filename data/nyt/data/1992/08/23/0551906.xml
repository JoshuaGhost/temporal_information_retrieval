        <p>With his sharply trimmed beard and fast-talking self-assurance, Nick Gomez could easily pass for a character in "Laws of Gravity," his first feature film, which opens on Wednesday. Mr. Gomez both wrote and directed the story of Jimmy (Peter Greene) and Jon (Adam Trese), two small-time criminals in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, whose lives veer out of control when a friend arrives in town with a load of illegal handguns.</p>
        <p>The resemblance between creator and characters is not coincidental. "I was a knucklehead who did a lot of stupid stuff as a kid," Mr. Gomez said one recent afternoon in an office at the Shooting Gallery, the downtown production facility where "Laws of Gravity" was edited. Now 29, Mr. Gomez grew up in an Irish-Italian neighborhood on the fringes of Cambridge, Mass. Though his father is Chilean, he considers himself to have been "basically just an Anglo-Saxon Boston kid."</p>

        <p>With his sharply trimmed beard and fast-talking self-assurance, Nick Gomez could easily pass for a character in "Laws of Gravity," his first feature film, which opens on Wednesday. Mr. Gomez both wrote and directed the story of Jimmy (Peter Greene) and Jon (Adam Trese), two small-time criminals in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, whose lives veer out of control when a friend arrives in town with a load of illegal handguns.</p>
        <p>The resemblance between creator and characters is not coincidental. "I was a knucklehead who did a lot of stupid stuff as a kid," Mr. Gomez said one recent afternoon in an office at the Shooting Gallery, the downtown production facility where "Laws of Gravity" was edited. Now 29, Mr. Gomez grew up in an Irish-Italian neighborhood on the fringes of Cambridge, Mass. Though his father is Chilean, he considers himself to have been "basically just an Anglo-Saxon Boston kid."</p>
        <p>"I really didn't attend school from the sixth grade on," he explained. "I had a couple of assault charges; they put me on probation. There was a long period when I was kind of crossed off the list, a goner."</p>
        <p>That period is over. "Laws Of Gravity" received glowing reviews after its premiere last March in the New Directors/New Films series. "Nick Gomez makes an impressive debut," wrote Vincent Canby in The Times, calling the film "a vividly acted and extremely well-photographed tale." He added, "Mr. Gomez's narrative is bleak, but it is kept in such tight focus, and dramatized with such intensity, that the effect is spellbinding."</p>
        <p>The critical success of "Laws of Gravity" is all the more remarkable because it was made for $38,000, which was raised privately. Mr. Gomez shaped his script to the budget, setting the story in his own neighborhood and keeping it compact. He rehearsed the actors for four weeks to cut down on shooting time. The movie was filmed -- by Jean de Segonzac, who normally shoots documentaries -- with a hand-held camera in only 12 days.</p>
        <p>"Nick has incredible brash confidence," said Mr. de Segonzac. He praised the director's willingness to allow him a free hand, rather than insist on constant control.</p>
        <p>Said Larry Meistrich, who co-produced the film with his partner, Bob Gosse: "He doesn't have that Hollywood ego problem."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gomez directed partly on instinct, partly from experience gained from making several shorts. After choosing his actors, none well known, he treated the screenplay as "a blueprint," inviting them to improvise dialogue he later wrote into the script.</p>
        <p>Did he help them understand their character's motives?</p>
        <p>He shrugged. "It's like, 'You punched my girlfriend, now I punch you.' It's not that difficult."</p>
        <p>An interest in music helped pull Mr. Gomez out of his adolescent tailspin. He formed a punk-rock band with some friends, widening his circle and increasing his discomfort with his lack of education. Eventually, he earned a high-school equivalency diploma and went on to college. At the State University of New York at Purchase, he met Mr. Gosse, then a student in the film department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gosse and Mr. Meistrich now plan to produce Mr. Gomez's next screenplay, called "Animals." It, too, draws on its author's past -- it's about teen-age car thieves in Boston -- but, because the story takes place in the 1990's, Mr. Gomez said, the stakes are higher than when he was in school.</p>
        <p>"With the proliferation of handguns, kids get killed over what should have been nothing more than a shoving match. We got into fist fights, but it usually didn't get much more lethal than a knife. Certainly we weren't all packing heat."</p>
