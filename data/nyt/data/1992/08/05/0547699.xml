        <p>Although the state Legislature has passed Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's $800 million bond plan to create jobs and improve the state's infrastructure, debate over the proposal is far from over. Two of the biggest hurdles remain: deciding how the money should be spent and persuading voters to approve the plan in the November election.</p>
        <p>The passage of the bond act was a big victory for Mr. Cuomo, who had made it the centerpiece of his economic development program this legislative session and who had feared just a month ago that the measure was dead. Its passage last week prompted the Governor to call the session, which has ended for the summer, "extraordinary." Mr. Cuomo signed the bill on Monday, so the proposal will be put on the ballot in November.</p>
        <p>As the state continues to reel under the weight of the recession, Governor Cuomo hopes the bond act will prime the economy and create jobs by putting people to work to upgrade roads, water mains and other improvements, and then by attracting businesses to the newly improved areas. State officials say the plan will bring in about 25,000 new construction jobs right away and hundreds of thousands of other jobs in the ensuing years.</p>
        <p>But while most politicians would normally be delighted at the prospect of having economic development projects to take home to their constituents, some conservatives fear political repercussions from supporting anything that could lead to more state debt in the current political climate. Conservative Opposition</p>
        <p>"In these tough fiscal times, some politicians are unwilling to go along with spending of any kind," Brian D. Backstrom, vice president for research at Change-NY, a conservative group that opposes the bond act, said recently.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the state's Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, has called the proposal to pay for infrastructure improvements with money borrowed through bond sales a "disastrous economic plan" that would cause state taxes to rise.</p>
        <p>"Once again, away from public scrutiny, the backroom politicians have reached agreement on an economic package that will increase the economic misery of New Yorkers," he said. "If this bond act is approved it will fuel higher taxes in the near future, taxes that will lead to more private-sector jobs fleeing New York."</p>
        <p>Some supporters of the bond act have expressed concern over whether voters will approve it. The last large bond proposal, a $2 billion initiative intended to set aside money for the environment, was rejected by voters in 1990.</p>
        <p>This time, officials say, they hope to raise voters' consciousness about the bond act through speeches and public appearances, although they are barred by law from advertising or specifically asking voters to support it.</p>
        <p>"What's better than putting people to work?" Governor Cuomo asked at a recent news conference. He added that the bond act would do more than employ people just for the sake of employing them.</p>
        <p>"This is not just basket weaving," he said. "This is hundreds of thousands of jobs. You find another way to put people to work right now, when we need it worse than we have at any time since the Great Depression."</p>
        <p>Even before the voters decide the fate of the proposal, politicians in Albany will be scrambling over how to divide the money.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Cuomo's plan, $600 million would go to the state's 62 counties and the five boroughs of New York City, based on population, with a $2 million minimum per county or borough; $100 million would be divided regionally, and $100 million would be used for statewide infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The money will go to decidedly unglamorous projects, like sewer hookups and water lines, that would help persuade companies to move in, said Mary Ann Crotty, the Governor's director of policy management. Localities would submit proposals to a legislative task force, which would allocate the money based on criteria outlined in the legislation. The bulk of the money should be spoken for by October. If the bond act passes on Nov. 3, she said, the projects could begin next spring. Renovation and Development</p>
        <p>The money could be used to renovate aging industrial parks or develop idle state land or to reopen closed factories. It could not be used as a loan or grant to an individual company, unless it can be proved that the public would benefit from the company's moving into the area.</p>
        <p>New York City's share of the money would come to about $239 million, money it needs because of reductions in its own capital budget in the last couple of years. Projects that might be financed with the money include improvement of the Harlem River railyard for a flower wholesale market; infrastructure for an industrial park in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and refurbishment of Pier 11 on the East River in Manhattan for commercial and tourist use, said a spokesman for the state Department of Economic Development.</p>
        <p>"This is a good deal for the city," said John Bozzella, the city's lobbyist in Albany. "No matter how big your capital budget is, you don't thumb your nose at $239 million."</p>
