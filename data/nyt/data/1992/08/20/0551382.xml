        <p>It seems like a plan that is worthy and simple enough:</p>
        <p>A company buys the life insurance policies of AIDS patients at reduced value so the patients can have at least some cash from the policies while they are alive. After they die, the company is paid the full amount due under the policies.</p>
        <p>So in 1988 an industry was founded. Already, it has bought an estimated $100 million in insurance policies from terminally ill patients, offering them anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of a policy's face value, depending on how long the patient is expected to live.</p>
        <p>The two dozen new companies, which advertise in magazines across the country, have been praised by advocates for AIDS patients as providing in many cases the only means to pay for health care and housing. Patients with other terminal illnesses use the programs as well.</p>
        <p>But now the practice is raising a host of questions for consumers and regulators, ranging from issues of privacy to violations of securities laws. Yesterday in Washington, an association of state securities regulators said some unsavory practices that could victimize both AIDS patients and investors are emerging in parts of the industry.  Creating a Market</p>
        <p>Some companies are arranging sales of the life insurance policies to investors who then become the beneficiaries. Regulators say such deals are creating a kind of futures market in death, in which an investor can reap varying amounts of large and quick profits as soon as the patient dies.</p>
        <p>"They are asking people to speculate on the life of another," said Glenn Pomeroy, the Securities Commissioner of North Dakota. "The amount of one's return would depend on how quickly the patient would die. Not only is this hunt for investors extremely offensive, this scheme is illegal."</p>
        <p>Mr. Pomeroy said he issued a cease-and-desist order against two companies that offered investors a "menu" of patients to choose from, with information on the white-cell counts in their blood, their infections and their life expectancy. The practice, he said, violates state securities laws because the transactions amount to sales of securities and are being conducted by people not licensed to sell securities.  Regulatory Question</p>
        <p>Companies selling policies, however, say they are not acting illegally and that the policies are similar to other investments not regulated by securities laws.</p>
        <p>Since 1988, when the first company was started, in New Mexico, 25 have gone into business across the nation and have acquired insurance policies with a value of approximately $100 million, said David Petersen, a retired New York financial planner who has AIDS and who specializes in financial planning for the terminally ill.</p>
        <p>Only New Mexico, Kansas and California regulate the new field.</p>
        <p>Most insurers will not write new life policies for people known to have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS; the industry has, however, paid out more than $640 million on policies of already-insured people who died of AIDS.</p>
        <p>Many traditional life insurance companies offer customers who are terminally ill with AIDS the chance to get their benefits while still alive. But in most of those cases, the prognosis must be that the patient has less than six months or at most a year to live.</p>
        <p>Prudential Insurance, for example, offers policyholders more than 90 percent of their policy payouts, but only if their doctor certifies that they will not live more than six months.</p>
        <p>The smaller companies, in effect, charge more than the traditional companies, usually giving the policyholder 50 to 80 percent of the benefit payable on death. But they will give cash to people who have two, three or in some cases as much as five years to live. The longer the life expectancy, the lower the cash payout.</p>
        <p>In general the new industry serves a useful function for people with limited resources, said Dr. Robert J. Darga, the director of programs for the National Association of People With AIDS, a nonprofit group in Washington. "It is definitely growing, and as the epidemic continues to take its toll we can expect an ever greater demand," he said.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's news conference, however, Lewis Brothers, the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, the national organization of 50 state securities regulators, said the sales to investors by some companies might be misleading the investors about what they were buying.</p>
        <p>For example, the regulatory system cannot verify the accuracy of medical information on the patient whose policy the investor is buying. In addition, Mr. Pomeroy, the North Dakota Commissioner, said investors should be wary when they are led to believe that any individual is going to die within a certain period of time.</p>
        <p>Officials said that four states were investigating the sales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pomeroy said he was issuing cease-and-desist orders against two companies, National Insurance Marketing of Panama City, Fla. and Life Partners Inc. of Waco Tex.  Practices Questioned</p>
        <p>The companies, he said, sent packets of information to potential investors that promised returns of more than 20 percent and provided a selection of patients to choose from, along with medical information on each.</p>
        <p>"This form of marketing is ghoulish, insensitive, possibly violative of confidentiality rights," Mr. Pomeroy said. "They are selling securities, and they are not registered to do so." One concern, he said, was that potentially damaging personal information could be widely disseminated. Sales agents, for example, are sometimes given the last names of patients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pomeroy also said, however, that most companies were providing a valid and important service.</p>
        <p>The president of National Insurance, Joe Sowell, said in a telephone interview that he disagreed with Mr. Pomeroy's assertion that his company had violated the law. He said the sales, which his company conducts as a marketer for Life Partners, were similar to sales of houses, which are not covered by securities regulations.  Making a Comparison</p>
        <p>At Life Partners in Texas, the company's president, Brian Pardo, likened the sales to the reselling of bank mortgages to investors. He said that just as the investor who buys a mortgage from a bank is nearly certain to get payments from a homeowner, so the buyer of the life insurance policy of an AIDS patient can count on payment from an insurance company, because of what Mr. Pardo said was the certainty of death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pardo also said he did not believe his company had violated any law. He attributed the problem in North Dakota to overzealous marketing on the part of National Insurance.  Mr. Pardo added that many of the 25 companies that buy life insurance policies from the terminally ill do not have the capital themselves to make the purchases. They use companies like Life Partners as intermediaries to find investors to buy the policies.</p>
        <p>Companies like Living Benefits of Albuquerque, N.M., and Accelerated Benefits of New York City say they raise their own capital and do not sell policies to outside investors.</p>
        <p>AIDS support groups say policyholders should be aware of some things. For instance, taking a loan against their policy or getting a prepayment from the insurance company is a tax-free transaction, but taxes may have to be paid on the sale of a life insurance policy.</p>
        <p>David Eng, a spokesman for Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said sales were not the best course for some patients, like the destitute who would be made ineligible for Medicaid benefits by the sudden increase in their income and assets. "It is kind of a reflection of the health-care crisis," he said. "People end up being pauperized by this process."  COMPANY NEWS</p>
