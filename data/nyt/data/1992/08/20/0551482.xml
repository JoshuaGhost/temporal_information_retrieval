        <p>Bob Lurie, eager to get approval for his $110 million sale of the San Francisco Giants, has agreed to support the effort of a group of owners to oust Commissioner Fay Vincent in exchange for their support of the Giants' move to St. Petersburg, Fla., some owners said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the guerrilla warfare being waged against Vincent by a group of owners led by Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Peter O'Malley of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lurie had been among the group of owners supporting the commissioner.

        <p>Bob Lurie, eager to get approval for his $110 million sale of the San Francisco Giants, has agreed to support the effort of a group of owners to oust Commissioner Fay Vincent in exchange for their support of the Giants' move to St. Petersburg, Fla., some owners said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In the guerrilla warfare being waged against Vincent by a group of owners led by Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox and Peter O'Malley of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lurie had been among the group of owners supporting the commissioner. But now, Lurie is said to have joined Vincent's opponents, who have challenged the commissioner on a variety of issues, including his role in labor relations, his realignment of the National League and his allocation of expansion money between the two leagues.</p>
        <p>Lurie, through a spokesman, denied that he had made any kind of deal linking Vincent's status and the Giants' proposed move, but three owners said they had been told by other owners that Lurie had agreed to sign a letter making a half-dozen charges against Vincent and calling for his resignation. If he doesn't resign, the owners suggest in the letter, he could face dismissal.</p>
        <p>Vincent declined to comment on the developments but said that no signed letter has been presented to him. None of the owners who acknowledged having seen a copy of the letter would disclose the specific charges. But others who had heard about the letter said two points raised dealt with Vincent's credibility and his failure to maintain good relationships with the televsion networks.</p>
        <p>Two owners who said they had seen the letter said the accusations it contains are false.</p>
        <p>Lurie, who has maintained a low profile since reaching an agreement in principle on Aug. 7 to sell the Giants to a Florida group, refused to be interviewed. Duffy Jennings, the Giants' vice president for public relations, said that the owner would not respond to questions about "private business between owners."</p>
        <p>Jennings said he asked Lurie about the report that he had made a deal with the anti-Vincent faction. "He said he's made no such agreement with any owners," Jennings said.</p>
        <p>One owner, who said he had heard that Lurie had made an agreement, expressed hope that the report would turn out to be incorrect.</p>
        <p>"I've heard he's now joined," said the owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It was suggested that he did it to gain favor. But I don't want to believe it. It would be sad to strike deals like that."</p>
        <p>Two other owners said that their information on Lurie's entering into the agreement meshed with what they called a noticeable change in the view of some American League owners to the proposed move of the Giants.</p>
        <p>Initially, the two owners said, the move faced adamant opposition from A.L. owners, primarily because the league didn't want to concede the entire state of Florida to the National League. The Florida Marlins, one of two expansion franchises, are scheduled to join the National League next season as the state's first major league franchise.</p>
        <p>But more recently, the two owners said, American League owners who had at first been opposed to the move altered their position.</p>
        <p>"They decided to give up Florida if they could get rid of the commissioner," one of them said.</p>
        <p>The same owner said Reinsdorf and Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and another ardent member of the group trying to oust Vincent, were believed to be influential in getting some American League owners to change their minds.</p>
        <p>Reinsdorf and Selig did not return telephone calls seeking comment on the letter or Lurie's involvement. The Numbers Lurie Needs</p>
        <p>The Giants' move to St. Petersburg requires the approval of the commissioner, 11 of 14 National League clubs and 8 of 14 American League clubs. Although Vincent two months ago gave Lurie permission to explore all of his options, he has not indicated whether he would approve the move.</p>
        <p>It is possible there are enough National League owners not aligned with the anti-Vincent faction to block the Giants' move, without any concern over the commissioner's status. There is a growing feeling that the owners should wait to see if the city of San Francisco could come up with an alternative to an out-of-town sale.</p>
        <p>Lurie has said he would not entertain other offers while the St. Petersburg deal is awaiting approval. But if someone steps forward in San Francisco and identifies himself as a willing purchaser, the N.L. owners who don't like the proposed move could block it and force Lurie to sell the team to the local buyer.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in Chicago yesterday, A.L. owners held a general discussion of the Giants' sale and possible transfer and what it could mean to the league. The owners took no position on the Giants' sale but, in an unofficial vote, unanimously approved the sale of the Detroit Tigers to Mike Ilitch.</p>
        <p>Vincent has worked to help the Giants in their effort to get a new stadium in the San Francisco area. He joined Lurie in campaigning for the passage of ballot questions aimed at providing funds for a park that would replace the much-criticized Candlestick Park.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of Vincent's efforts on Lurie's behalf, the Giants' owner had supported the commissioner in an earlier effort by the dissidents to induce him to resign. In late June and early July, several owners said, the Reinsdorf group circulated a fax soliciting colleagues to sign a letter that was intended to get Vincent to resign.</p>
        <p>Vincent said he had been told of the fax's existence, but he had not seen it. He also said his opponents were wasting their time and energy.</p>
        <p>"I told them if they came to me with 25 signatures I wouldn't quit," he said at the time. Vincent's term expires in April 1994.</p>
        <p>The number of owners involved in the July initiative varied, depending on who was counting. One anti-Vincent owner told another owner that the fax had drawn 20 signatures. The next day, another owner said, the same owner told him it had 16 signatures. Yet another owner said 22 owners opposed Vincent and wanted him to resign.</p>
        <p>The group never presented that letter to Vincent.</p>
