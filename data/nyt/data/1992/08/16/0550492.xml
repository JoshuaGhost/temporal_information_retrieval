        <p>Small co-ops and condominiums have long asserted that when it comes to the city's property-tax policies, they were burdened with an unfair disadvantage.</p>

        <p>Small co-ops and condominiums have long asserted that when it comes to the city's property-tax policies, they were burdened with an unfair disadvantage.</p>
        <p>"On one hand, the law required that we be assessed as if we were rental buildings," said Lawrence H. McGaughey, an attorney and secretary of the 2-10 Units Association, a group formed two years ago to press for property-tax reform, "but at the same time we did not have the protection of the assessment cap that small rental buildings have."</p>
        <p>The group's lobbying efforts have paid off. Late last month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed a bill that brings small co-ops and condominiums into the category of residences -- one-, two- and three-family homes and rental buildings with from four to 10 units -- that have annual caps of 6 to 8 percent on their tax assessment increases. The new law puts an 8 percent cap on the assessment increase for co-ops and condominiums with fewer than than 11 units.</p>
        <p>The buildings will be reassessed on the new basis, beginning with the 1993-1994 tax year. But the measure does not provide for tax refunds based on higher assessments in previous years.</p>
