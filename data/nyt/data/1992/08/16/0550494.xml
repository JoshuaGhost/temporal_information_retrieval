        <p>Can a Dodger-Giant rivalry, transferred successfully from New York to California 35 years ago, survive if the Giants settle in the Tampa Bay area?</p>
        <p>Probably not. Two of the three necessary ingredients will be missing and, most likely, the third as well.</p>
        <p>The ingredients are: 1. Proximity 2. A pre-existing antagonism between the home communities. 3. The memory of close pennant races.</p>
        <p>Proximity facilitates endless arguing, face to face, among those with conflicting loyalties. In New York, Giant and Dodger partisans had access to each other, could visit each other's ball parks easily, and could find enemy loyalists in their own neighborhoods or even their own families. And although San Francisco and Los Angeles are 400 miles apart, a significant number of residents travel back and forth frequently for business or pleasure.</p>
        <p>A "natural antipathy" between communities must also exist on many levels for a sports rivalry to latch on to these feelings of affiliation. Brooklyn and New York (meaning Manhattan) had it, and so did Los Angeles and San Francisco, long before baseball teams got there.</p>
        <p>But those who travel between Los Angeles and Tampa-St. Petersburg are few, and the two communities have never related to each other in any way, hostile or otherwise.</p>
        <p>As for pennant races, it's hard to imagine that a team in Florida and a team in California will wind up in the same division for very long, no matter how the National League's realignment pattern eventually works out. On the basis of scheduling alone, it would not be feasible.</p>
        <p>So the element that made the Giant-Dodger rivalry so intense from generation to generation will no longer exist: awareness of history as an addition to previous legends. Figures Tell It All</p>
        <p>Attendance figures reflect the life of the rivalry. In their New York phase, the 22 annual meetings provided a cushion, especially for the weaker of the two in any particular year. For instance, when the Giants fell out of contention in 1956 while the Dodgers were winning another pennant, the 11 Dodger games at the Polo Grounds accounted for more than a third of the Giants' 630,000 season attendance.</p>
        <p>The California picture has been the same. Of the top 10 largest Dodger Stadium crowds, eight involve the Giants; of the top 10 at Candlestick, five involve the Dodgers (while three others are opening-day games, a traditional sellout in San Francisco). All the records for three-game, four-game and weekend series at both places include the other team.</p>
        <p>Last year, when the Giants finished a distant fourth, the nine Dodger visits averaged 40,747 a game and the total accounted for 21 percent of the season's 1,737,478 total attendance in only 11 percent of the dates. The games in Los Angeles averaged 45,294, only slightly higher than the season-long Dodger average of 41,335. The proportion shifted not because the Giant-Dodger interest was any less, but because the Dodgers have been doing so well in all their games.</p>
        <p>Another bonanza in California has been local television rights. The rivalry road games sent back to the home city have been the basis of lucrative contracts, carrying the rest of the schedule.</p>
        <p>Finally, both San Francisco and Los Angeles contained an ever increasing number of transplanted New Yorkers, and their California-born offspring, as well as frequent visitors from the East. These formed a word-of-mouth historical continuity that added to the rivalry's flowering in a new setting.</p>
        <p>No such assets or connections are likely for a team based in St. Petersburg, Fla., no matter what name it bears.</p>
