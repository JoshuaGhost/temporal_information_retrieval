        <p>To read the ever-changing reports about diet and health is to fear that you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. The newest example is cholesterol. For years now, people who don't know the difference between cholesterol and collateral have just</p>
        <p>known</p>
        <p>that a high cholesterol count -- 240 units or more -- is bad news. It still is.</p>
        <p>True, several studies described in yesterday's Science Times reveal a curiously sinister side to especially low levels of this fatty alcohol substance in the blood -- 160 units and under. People with such readings are far less likely to die of heart disease, but it turns out they are far</p>
        <p>more</p>
        <p>likely to commit suicide or homicide, and die from strokes, certain cancers, liver and lung disease.</p>

        <p>To read the ever-changing reports about diet and health is to fear that you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. The newest example is cholesterol. For years now, people who don't know the difference between cholesterol and collateral have just</p>
        <p>known</p>
        <p>that a high cholesterol count -- 240 units or more -- is bad news. It still is.</p>
        <p>True, several studies described in yesterday's Science Times reveal a curiously sinister side to especially low levels of this fatty alcohol substance in the blood -- 160 units and under. People with such readings are far less likely to die of heart disease, but it turns out they are far</p>
        <p>more</p>
        <p>likely to commit suicide or homicide, and die from strokes, certain cancers, liver and lung disease.</p>
        <p>Even so, it's not another occasion to lament damned if you do, damned if you don't all over again. As Dr. Antonio Gotto, a cardiologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, explains, the association of these ailments with low cholesterol levels isn't necessarily evidence that low cholesterol causes them. There can be many explanations for low cholesterol. Alcoholics, for instance, are apt to have very low cholesterol levels -- and a higher than average association with homicide and suicide. But it is the alcoholism itself that is almost surely responsible for the low cholesterol, and not vice versa, given alcoholics' diets.</p>
        <p>The new findings merit hard study and elaboration, not only to clarify an individual's possible confusion about cholesterol but about public policy as well. Medical authorities like the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association are pushing for national dietary guidelines intended to lower average cholesterol levels.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, all that medicine knows</p>
        <p>with certainty</p>
        <p>is that people with high cholesterol run a high risk of dying of heart disease. The new studies, however fascinating, are no justification to run out for a New York strip steak and a side of fries.</p>
