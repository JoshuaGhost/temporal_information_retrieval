        <p>Jeff Hostetler, the Giants' starting quarterback, woke up today with a slightly hyperextended right elbow. As a result, he will not play Saturday night in his team's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, Coach Ray Handley said the quarterback's condition did not appear to be serious. He said Hostetler apparently aggravated the elbow in practice Thursday. The Giants held a walk-through practice today, as they usually do on the day before a game. Quarterbacks do not throw the ball in walk-through practices, so Hostetler did not miss any throwing time today. Instead, like the other quarterbacks, Hostetler did conditioning runs.</p>

        <p>Jeff Hostetler, the Giants' starting quarterback, woke up today with a slightly hyperextended right elbow. As a result, he will not play Saturday night in his team's preseason game against the Cleveland Browns at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, Coach Ray Handley said the quarterback's condition did not appear to be serious. He said Hostetler apparently aggravated the elbow in practice Thursday. The Giants held a walk-through practice today, as they usually do on the day before a game. Quarterbacks do not throw the ball in walk-through practices, so Hostetler did not miss any throwing time today. Instead, like the other quarterbacks, Hostetler did conditioning runs.</p>
        <p>The Giants' players will be off Sunday and then will work out lightly Monday afternoon. Full practice will resume Tuesday. There was no immediate indication if Hostetler would be ready by then.</p>
        <p>The Giants had planned to start Hostetler against the Browns and have him play into or through the second quarter. He was to have been followed by Kent Graham and Phil Simms. Now Simms will start and will be followed by Graham and Jeff Carlson. Dave Brown, the heralded rookie who did not sign until Wednesday night, will not play in this game.  The Giants might rest Rodney Hampton, the starting tailback, who has an inflamed right knee, and that would be a good opportunity for such young running backs as Charlie Young and Torrey Wright. Kanavis McGhee will start at left outside linebacker, and Corey Miller will share the job if his sore shoulder allows.</p>
        <p>National Football League teams, now carrying up to 80 players, must cut down to 60 by Aug. 25 and to the regular-season limit of 47 by Aug. 31. While this game will help determine which players will survive, Handley said it was not a make-or-break situation for any Giant player.</p>
        <p>"Certain people are moving ahead," Handley said. "But anyone I didn't think had a chance to make this team, I've gotten rid of him. Anybody still here has shown me something." Three Missing Starters</p>
        <p>With three weeks to go until the start of the regular season, three Giants starters are still unsigned: outside linebacker Carl Banks, nose tackle Eric Howard and offensive tackle/guard Eric Moore.</p>
        <p>Harry Hulmes, the Giants' assistant general manager, said he talked Thursday night with Frank Bauer, Howard's agent, and Mark Mottaz, Moore's agent. Hulmes said he talked again with Mottaz today, but he added, "Eric Moore is still a holdout by a good margin."</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several of Howard's teammates think he will be in camp next week.</p>
        <p>Banks is asking for $1.5 million and the Giants have not moved past $1.1 million. Banks was not optimistic. "Nothing is happening," he said.  Autograph Material</p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, Dave Brown, the quarterback the Giants took in the first round of the supplemental draft, was a northern New Jersey youngster wrapped up in the Giants.</p>
        <p>"I hate to admit it," he said, "but I have Phil Simms's autograph. My father got it for me. I think he saw him in an elevator. I have Richard Todd and other players. They're in a big frame."</p>
        <p>And where is that frame displayed? "I don't know where it is," Brown said sheepishly. 'Not Too Many Drops'</p>
        <p>A year ago, Joey Smith was a rookie free agent struggling to make the Giants as a wide receiver and kick returner. He spent most of the season on the developmental squad, was finally activated and returned three punts against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
        <p>Now he is trying to make the team again. He faces another uphill battle because Mark Ingram, Stephen Baker and Ed McCaffrey are sure to win jobs, and Chris Calloway, Millard Hamilton and Greg Taylor are contending with Smith for perhaps only one job. But Smith has been impressive in camp, and McCaffrey's inflamed disk may open the door.</p>
        <p>Smith has more straightaway speed than any other receiver on the team. But Handley said: "Joey is catching the ball better than in the past, but not consistently enough for me. Sometimes, for that great speed, you'll tolerate a drop once in a while. But not too many drops." In-Progress Reports</p>
        <p>Thumbnail assessments from Handley:</p>
        <p>*On Perry Williams, the ninth-year cornerback -- "He's been real solid. No athlete on this team comes in more prepared. He gives you complete concentration. In many ways, he's a coach's dream. I haven't seen any loss in his physical skills."</p>
        <p>*On Derek Brown, the rookie tight end and first-round draft choice: "He's been a good practice player. He will improve. He will be a real good tight end."</p>
