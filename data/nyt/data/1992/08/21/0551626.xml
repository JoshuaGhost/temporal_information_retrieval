        <p>Motorola Inc., in a move to gain entry to the $4.6 billion world market for flat-panel display screens, said today that it would acquire 20 percent of In Focus Systems Inc. for $22 million. The companies agreed to form a joint venture to produce the liquid crystal displays in the United States.</p>
        <p>"Our game plan is to increase the contrast and speed, so you can put video or TV on flat panels," said Steven R. Hix, chairman of In Focus, based in Tualatin, Ore.</p>

        <p>Motorola Inc., in a move to gain entry to the $4.6 billion world market for flat-panel display screens, said today that it would acquire 20 percent of In Focus Systems Inc. for $22 million. The companies agreed to form a joint venture to produce the liquid crystal displays in the United States.</p>
        <p>"Our game plan is to increase the contrast and speed, so you can put video or TV on flat panels," said Steven R. Hix, chairman of In Focus, based in Tualatin, Ore.</p>
        <p>Many American companies, large and small, have tried and failed to enter the flat-panel display business, which is currently dominated by the Japanese. Japanese companies have invested billions in flat-panel research, hoping to establish a lead in a technology that could replace the cathode-ray tube now used in computers and television sets. Competing in New Markets</p>
        <p>By gaining promising new technology, Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., is positioning itself to compete with Japanese companies like the Toshiba Corporation and the NEC Corporation, which are working on promising markets like high-definition television and color displays that will be used in portable communications products.</p>
        <p>Motorola said it would acquire 2.2 million shares of In Focus common stock for $10 a share. In Focus gained $1.50 in over-the-counter trading today, closing at $9.25; Motorola advanced $1, to $84.875, on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>Motorola and In Focus said they would have a joint plant in the Portland, Ore., area. They expect to begin producing small displays -- 6.5 inches wide or less -- by the end of 1994, for initial use in products like projection systems and personal communication devices. Their plans call for a later expansion of the plant's capacity to produce larger screens for personal computers and other markets.</p>
        <p>"In Focus has developed a key core technology that we believe will dramatically impact the LCD industry," Robert Growney, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's paging and wireless data group, said in a statement. "In this joint venture, we will be bringing together unique skill sets from each partner to firmly establish this breakthrough in the market," he added.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department handed domestic flat-panel manufacturers a mixed victory a year ago. While it ruled that the Japanese were dumping so-called active matrix displays and levied a stiff duty, it spared the much more commonly used -- and less expensive -- passive matrix displays. Surprisingly, In Focus joined with the Japanese screen makers and American computer companies in successfully lobbying against the duty on passive matrix displays. Uses Own Technology</p>
        <p>In Focus produces passive matrix displays but incorporates a proprietary technology called Active Addressing, which improves speed and contrast. Where active matrix screens have a transistor mounted behind each pixel, or picture element, making them very difficult and expensive to manufacture, Active Addressing replaces those multiple transistors with a single integrated circuit.</p>
        <p>The new joint venture will be responsible for marketing application specific integrated circuits, or ASIC's -- a type of chip, manufactured by Motorola, that embodies the Active Addressing technology.</p>
