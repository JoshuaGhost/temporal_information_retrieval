        <p>Pfizer Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 15 million shares of common stock in Minerals Technologies Inc., its restructured minerals unit. The sale represents 60 percent of Minerals Technologies, which analysts said had a total value of about $400 million. Sixty percent of the estimated total value is $240 million, so the shares will be offered at $16 each, analysts said.</p>

        <p>Pfizer Inc. said yesterday that it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 15 million shares of common stock in Minerals Technologies Inc., its restructured minerals unit. The sale represents 60 percent of Minerals Technologies, which analysts said had a total value of about $400 million. Sixty percent of the estimated total value is $240 million, so the shares will be offered at $16 each, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Jerry Brimeyer of Shearson Lehman Brothers estimated Minerals Technologies' pretax profit margins at 8 percent on projected 1992 sales of $385 million. He values companies with high single-digit operating margins at about one year's revenues. Pfizer said it would retain 7.75 million to 10 million shares of Minerals Technologies, depending on whether the underwriters exercised their options. The offering will be managed by Lazard Freres &amp; Company; Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, and Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Company. Pfizer stock closed yesterday at $80.50, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
