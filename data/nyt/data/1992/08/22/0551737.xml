        <p>For the uncertain television voter in this season of the family, the political choice was sharpened this week. The election came down to a contest between the score or more Bushes and the dozen or so Farrow-Previn-Allens who populated the tube during the days of public embraces in Houston and domestic disruption in New York City. Ms. Farrow's family was reportedly valued at $7 million. The value of Mr. Bush's was the White House.</p>
        <p>At the sight of that screen of Bushes at the Astrodome on Wednesday night, hard-nosed political commentators went gooey. David Gergen, who usually maintains a sober mien on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," could scarcely contain himself. It was a very important moment, he kept saying, incredibly important. Professional skepticism gave way to open-mouthed awe as the grandmother of all First Ladies presided over the mother of all photo opportunities. It was repeated Thursday with the Quayle family and balloons.</p>

        <p>For the uncertain television voter in this season of the family, the political choice was sharpened this week. The election came down to a contest between the score or more Bushes and the dozen or so Farrow-Previn-Allens who populated the tube during the days of public embraces in Houston and domestic disruption in New York City. Ms. Farrow's family was reportedly valued at $7 million. The value of Mr. Bush's was the White House.</p>
        <p>At the sight of that screen of Bushes at the Astrodome on Wednesday night, hard-nosed political commentators went gooey. David Gergen, who usually maintains a sober mien on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour," could scarcely contain himself. It was a very important moment, he kept saying, incredibly important. Professional skepticism gave way to open-mouthed awe as the grandmother of all First Ladies presided over the mother of all photo opportunities. It was repeated Thursday with the Quayle family and balloons.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, television news and quasi-news shows were scrambling to get an exclusive shot of the house in which Mia Farrow was sequestered and rerunning clips of the famously reclusive Woody Allen making a declaration of love in front of other people's cameras. Marilyn Quayle countered with a prime-time confession in Houston about how rewarding it has been to live with Dan Quayle all these years.</p>
        <p>So for the television fan, the lines are drawn. It is the soap opera of the bicoastals versus the soap opera of middle America, the late-night jazz club (clarinet and saxophone) versus Sunday morning in church, the separate dwellings versus the double bed.</p>
        <p>Television has helped make the campaign issues manageable: Has Mrs. Quayle sacrificed more than Ms. Farrow? Has Maureen O'Sullivan contributed as much as Barbara Bush? Was Hillary Clinton spotted in line for "Annie Hall" when she should have been watching "Mary Poppins" with Chelsea? The race may come down to a montage of the multi-culturally with-it Farrow menage opposed to a Bush family Thanksgiving Day card inspired by Norman Rockwell.</p>
        <p>This is a contest made for Republicans. When Mr. Quayle picked on Murphy Brown, her admirers pointed out that she was mere fiction, as though that mattered. But Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow are said to be real, although given the treatment of celebrities on television and in the tabloids, one can never be sure. Either way, for admirers of Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan, television personalities both, who thundered forth the us-against-them organ peals that dominated the week in Houston, the Manhattan story is a morality tale on the paths of godlessness.</p>
        <p>Has anybody ever seen Woody Allen in church or at a Fourth of July parade or any of the other places where Mrs. Bush revealed she spent her time during the best years of her life as a young wife and mother in Texas? For Mr. Allen, the very word Texas is a punch line. (If Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle plan to attempt more campaign jokes like those in their acceptance speeches, they might study his timing.)</p>
        <p>In the religious war conjured up by Mr. Buchanan, Woody Allen is a general on the wrong side. Show business being what it is, can anyone doubt that he consorts with homosexuals? And he has never been a closet atheist. In more than one of his movies he has taken delight in kicking around men of the cloth and milking the amusement in scenes of real churchgoing Americans, whom he plainly finds ridiculous, being confronted with a neurotic Jew from New York. This man has been known to kid God, that Underachiever.</p>
        <p>When Republican sermonizers in Houston kept reminding their audience that the Democrats had met in Madison Square Garden, which happens to be in New York City, they may have thought they were only connecting the opposition with crime, homelessness and dirt; add now intimations of hanky-panky among those whom Dan Quayle likes to call the elite, known for their liberal inclinations and contributions to the other party.</p>
        <p>Here is the quintessential made-for-television debate. The candidates may drone on about growth packages whose details few will ever understand, but who can fail to understand the wholesome images that were packaged on that stage in Houston? A big audience without much patience for differences between this health plan and that one can be counted on to pay attention to the minutiae of any story involving romance or worse among actors.</p>
        <p>For the Democrats, the conjunction could hardly have been more unfortunate. Their only hope now is that despite the predictable recycling in Republican commercials, this week's images will be shaken off by others as the campaign bounces along. For the time being, Bill Clinton will probably avoid being photographed in the company of stars, and Hillary and Chelsea may be seen whipping up a batch of their mother-daughter cookies with Regis and Kathie Lee.</p>
