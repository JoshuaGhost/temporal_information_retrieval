        <p>Erik Howard wanted the respect that a million-dollar-a-year contract means to a nose tackle.</p>
        <p>That is why, he said, he had refused the Giants' offers until today, when he signed just below that lofty plateau, a two-year deal worth $1.9 million.</p>
        <p>The signing ended a 38-day contract dispute, giving Howard a two-year record of 66 training-camp days missed.</p>
        <p>Luckily for Howard and the team, nose tackle is the one position, except for the kickers, that requires the least practice time. His job is to lead the defensive surge by tying up two tacklers, freeing a rushing defensive end or linebacker to get to the quarterback.</p>
        <p>So even with a new defensive coordinator in Rod Rust, Howard said he expected no trouble getting ready for the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers on Sept. 6. He will probably see action in the Giants' final preseason game at Pittsburgh on Saturday night. It's Not the Same</p>
        <p>Although he has been working out at a gym, he conceded, "It's not like being in football shape."</p>
        <p>In signing, Howard solved what could have been a major problem. The Giants were using a 10th-round rookie from Syracuse named George Rooks as their starter at the position. Asked during today's hectic negotiations if he had thoughts of unseating Howard, Rooks said: "I don't know a thing. You're talking to a guy who's been doing this for five weeks."</p>
        <p>While bicoastal telephone negotiations were going on today between his agent and the team, Howard was working at his soon-to-open sports bar in Ramsey, N.J., named the Neutral Zone.</p>
        <p>"One reason you want the same as the other top nose tackles are getting is to gain the respect around the league," he explained. "You want to be paid as the best."</p>
        <p>The best nose tackle, as measured by contract value, is thought to be Jerry Ball of the Detroit Lions with an average annual salary of $1.2 million. The only other nose tackle at the million-dollar level is Michael Carter of the 49ers. Busy Little Giants</p>
        <p>During the dispute, Howard said he hadn't had much contact with his teammates because "they're pretty busy."</p>
        <p>So is he. By his own reckoning he has been helping to get the bar ready "night and day the last three months."</p>
        <p>"I had something to fall back on and occupy my time," he said.</p>
        <p>This will be Howard's seventh season. He was an alternate Pro Bowl nose tackle during the 1990 Super Bowl season. Then, while under contract, he held out last season for 28 days. He was fined $1,500 a day and eventually signed for $500,000. But he hurt his back early in the season, underwent surgery and missed 10 games.</p>
        <p>Howard's less-effective play, and absence, was one of the reasons for the team's mediocre 8-8 record last season.</p>
        <p>"Last year we were able to fine Howard when he didn't report to camp," said Harry Hulmes, the assistant general manager. "But this year, he's got no contract."</p>
        <p>Howard's agent, Frank Bauer of Stockton, Calif., could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Rooks had played much of the preseason, but was replaced early last Saturday in the game against the Jets by John Washington, an experienced veteran. It was the first time this summer that Washington played there, although he split time at the position last season with Lorenzo Freeman.</p>
        <p>Despite Howard's absense, it is the offense that has worried Coach Ray Handley, so far. He now has Phil Simms starting for the injured Jeff Hostetler.</p>
        <p>"I would have like to be more consistent offensively," Handley said as he regarded the 49ers' opener.</p>
        <p>And what about the quarterbacks? Does Simms playing for Hostetler affect the consistency of the offense?</p>
        <p>"I don't like to open up a can of worms," said Handley, "but I know their styles are different, even though each prepares very well." EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>DAVID BROWN, the rookie quarterback from Duke, got some advice in the game against the Jets from BROWNING NAGLE. Brown had been unsure of himself running the team. "Nagle said, 'Listen, you can't make a wrong decision. Just throw it. If it's intercepted, forget about it.' "</p>
