        <p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady ran into strong criticism this weekend from prominent Asian-Americans and the Japanese Embassy after he used the term "Japs" at an informal breakfast with reporters on Thursday.</p>
        <p>"We have been told our workers are idle and ill-educated, our goods uncompetitive and our managers inefficient and we can't compete with the Japs or the Germans or for that matter anybody else in the world," Mr. Brady said. He later apologized.</p>

        <p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady ran into strong criticism this weekend from prominent Asian-Americans and the Japanese Embassy after he used the term "Japs" at an informal breakfast with reporters on Thursday.</p>
        <p>"We have been told our workers are idle and ill-educated, our goods uncompetitive and our managers inefficient and we can't compete with the Japs or the Germans or for that matter anybody else in the world," Mr. Brady said. He later apologized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brady used the term only once during the breakfast, referring to "Japan" and "the Japanese" on many other occasions during the breakfast.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, called for Mr. Brady's resignation, saying the term was derogatory and insensitive when used in the 1950's and was even worse now. Japanese Embassy Complains</p>
        <p>"It really demonstrates the kind of insularity of this Administration, the people that George Bush surrounds himself with," said Mr. Matsui, who was already a critic of Mr. Brady before the incident.</p>
        <p>The Japanese Embassy also complained today about the remark. "We are disappointed that he used the phrase, which is often associated with a negative and demeaning tone with regard to the Japanese people," said Koichi Ai, an embassy press officer, when asked about the incident. "We didn't think it was something we should make a formal protest, but we are disappointed."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ai said that embassy officials on Thursday read Mr. Brady's remarks in a routine transcript of the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brady apologized about the incident when asked about it on Friday by a reporter from Hearst Newspapers, said Desiree Tucker-Sorini, the chief spokeswoman for the Treasury Department. Ms. Tucker-Sorini quoted Mr. Brady as saying: "At no time did I intend to offend anyone. If I did, I apologize."</p>
        <p>Representative Norman Y. Mineta, Democrat of California, also called late Friday for Mr. Brady's resignation. Like thousands of other Japanese-Americans, Mr. Mineta and Mr. Matsui were put in internment camps during World War II.</p>
        <p>At the breakfast meeting, Mr. Brady appeared to be alluding to remarks last winter by a senior Japanese politician, who said that American workers were "lazy" and that a third of them were illiterate. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa denounced those remarks at the time as not representing the view of the Japanese government.</p>
