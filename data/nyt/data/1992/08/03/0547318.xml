        <p>With a high jump of 7 feet 8 inches and only one previous miss, Javier Sotomayor won himself a small place in Olympic history tonight, not to mention a gold medal.</p>
        <p>He became the third winner for Cuba in the Olympic Summer Games after a 12-year political hiatus, a feat that so moved him that he cried when the competition ended.</p>
        <p>"The Cuban people are watching us very closely," he said later. "I'm sure this will have positive effects on the whole population. It is clear evidence that in spite of our current problems, we are still capable of great things." First Olympics in 12 Years</p>
        <p>Cuba last participated in the Summer Olympics in 1980 in Moscow. It joined the Soviet Union and other countries in boycotting the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, then, four years later, was one of several countries that honored North Korea's boycott of the Games in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>Sotomayor, 24 years old, the worldrecord-holder, missed only once at lower heights before failing three times at 7-9 1/4. Patrik Sjoeberg of Sweden missed only once, but at a higher height than Sotomayor's miss, to gain the silver, and American Hollis Conway shared the bronze medal with Artur Partyka of Poland and Tony Forsythe of Australia.</p>
        <p>The Unifed Team had a near sweep in the two other track and field finals tonight. Yelina Romanova and Tatyana Dorovskikh were first and second in the women's 3,000-meter race, with Angela Chalmers of Canada winning the bronze; and the hammer throw ended as it normally does, with a sweep by athletes from the old Soviet system.</p>
        <p>Romanova's time in a tight race with a lot of bumping and pushing was 8 minutes 46.04 seconds, to 8:46.85 for her teammate. PattiSue Plumer was the leading American, finishing fifth in 8:48.29.</p>
        <p>For the hammer throwers, it was the fourth time in the last five Olympics that Soviet roots were rewarded, and this time with three athletes who had not made the Soviet team in 1988.</p>
        <p>Andrei Abduvaliev of Tadzhikistan was the upset winner for throwing 270 feet 9 inches. Igor Astapkovich of Belarus, the favorite who had won his last five meets, took the silver medal with an effort of 268-1, and Igor Nikulin of Russia was third with 267.</p>
        <p>In qualifying competition today, Johnny Gray of the United States, who predicted a victory for himself, led eight runners into the 800-meter final, winning his semifinal in 1 minute 45.66 seconds. Paul Ereng of Kenya, the 1988 Olympic champion who ran in the same semifinal, slowed from his second spot after 400 meters and finished last.</p>
        <p>Mark Everett, the other American left, strained to grab second place in the other heat a hundredth of a second in front of Babacar Niang of Senegal, to finish behind William Tanui of Kenya, the African champion, and automatically advance.</p>
        <p>In earlier qualifying events, athletes from the United States had mostly good results. The major exception was the women's discus throw, in which the three Americans did not reach the final for the third consecutive non-boycotted Olympics.</p>
        <p>The best of them was Connie Price-Smith, whose throw of 192 feet 5 inches was more than 20 feet short of the round leader, Larissa Korotkevich of the Unified Team. High Hopes in High Hurdles</p>
        <p>In the men's 110-meter hurdles, Americans Tony Dees and Arthur Blake moved into the semifinals easily, Jack Pierce luckily. Pierce was awarded fourth place with the same time, 13.50, as a British athlete, Hughie Teape, who was given fifth place.</p>
        <p>All six of the 400-meter runners advanced: Steve Lewis, the 1988 Olympic champion, Quincy Watts and Danny Everett, the Seoul bronze medalist, among the men; and Jearl Miles, Natasha Kaiser and Rochelle Stevens in the women's event.</p>
        <p>Sandra Farmer-Patrick and Janeene Vickers advanced by winning their heats in the women's 400-meter hurdles, in 55.12 and 55.24. Tonja Buford, who was third in her heat, in 56.35, also advanced. FINISH LINE</p>
        <p>MEL ROSEN, the men's coach of the United States track and field team, acknowledged that CARL LEWIS will likely run in the final of the 400-meter relay next Saturday, replacing MARK WITHERSPOON, who ruptured an Achilles' tendon in the 100-meter semifinals on Saturday.</p>
        <p>"We'll have to see," Rosen said. "JAMES JETT will probably run the first round. The order we practiced with was MIKE MARSH, LEROY BURRELL, DENNIS MITCHELL and Lewis. But nothing is final yet. We'll have to see."</p>
        <p>Jett earned the chance to run in the relays by finishing fifth in the Olympic trials behind Mitchell, Witherspoon, Burrell and Marsh. Lewis was sixth.</p>
