        <p>It was the second round of executive changes for Tandycrafts in recent weeks. In January, Kenneth L. Gregson, 63 years old, stepped down as president and chief executive.

        <p>Tandycrafts Inc., a specialty retailer based in Fort Worth, said yesterday that R. E. Cox 3d had been named chairman and that John V. Sandlin, the interim president since last month, had been formally named president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>It was the second round of executive changes for Tandycrafts in recent weeks. In January, Kenneth L. Gregson, 63 years old, stepped down as president and chief executive. The company said that Mr. Gregson had retired from his senior posts, but would continue as a director and as a liaison between the board and employees.</p>
        <p>Tandycrafts, which owns 340 leather craft and other stores nationwide, experienced a 28 percent drop in net income in the fourth quarter of last year. A company spokesman, Michael J. Walsh, said several one-time charges, including a $600,000 workers' compensation payment and the closing of several outlets, caused the decline. He denied that the executive changes were related to the company's recent performance.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Cox nor Mr. Sandlin was avaliable for comment yesterday. Mr. Walsh said the changes were voted on by Tandycrafts' board, but he declined to discuss them in detail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox, 58, previously served as a director of the company but has never worked in its management. As of last September, he had owned only 500 common shares.</p>
        <p>As part of the reshuffling, Jerry L. Roy will resume the duties of chief operating officer, a post he relinquished a month ago. Mr. Walsh said that Mr. Roy had stepped down as part of a move to realign the work duties of senior management.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Roger A. Dickinson, William H. Michero, and John A. Wilson retired from the board. Carol Smith, operations manager of Joshua's Christian Stores, a chain of Christian book stores, was selected to fill one of the vacancies.</p>
        <p>"This is the first time that the board members have placed an employee onto the board," Mr. Walsh said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregson said in a statement: "The board now includes four employee-directors and three independent directors, which reflects the company's ownership."</p>
        <p>Under an employee stock ownership plan, Tandycrafts' employees own about 41 percent of the stock. Other employee plans account for an additional 11 percent, and officers and directors hold a further 11 percent.</p>
