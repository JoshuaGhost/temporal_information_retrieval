        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is sometimes fun to analyze a literary character as if she were a real person. But the psychiatrist in Pat Conroy's novel "The Prince of Tides" is not written as a real person. She follows a distinct literary tradition. Dr. Lowenstein's roles are those of a wise counselor, a mother-muse and an erotic object who is easily abandoned; these are a few of the traditional roles filled by Jewish women in literature.</p>

        <p>That is why your board of practicing psychiatrists was critical of her unprofessional conduct. As a psychiatrist, Dr. Lowenstein has more in common with the Rebeccas, of the Bible and of "Ivanhoe," than with Karen Horney.  MITZI WITKIN Great Neck, N. Y.</p>
