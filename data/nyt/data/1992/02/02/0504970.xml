        <p>PHILIP never met a man he didn't like. Honestly. Even though he likes everything, as well as everybody, he'd sooner spend an hour with a boor -- at an emotional remove -- than read a book, tour the galleries or attend a play or movie: the customary ephemeral distractions of his vacant, unpopulated existence.</p>
        <p>In "The Philanthropist" (London, 1970; Broadway, 1971) Christopher Hampton, at age 24, created an extraordinary original character in the overly literal, disengaged, fumbling and flustered Philip, a professor of philology and the precursor of the contemporary nerd. He is an intended inversion of Moliere's "Misanthrope" -- but just as off-putting in his terminal niceness.</p>

        <p>PHILIP never met a man he didn't like. Honestly. Even though he likes everything, as well as everybody, he'd sooner spend an hour with a boor -- at an emotional remove -- than read a book, tour the galleries or attend a play or movie: the customary ephemeral distractions of his vacant, unpopulated existence.</p>
        <p>In "The Philanthropist" (London, 1970; Broadway, 1971) Christopher Hampton, at age 24, created an extraordinary original character in the overly literal, disengaged, fumbling and flustered Philip, a professor of philology and the precursor of the contemporary nerd. He is an intended inversion of Moliere's "Misanthrope" -- but just as off-putting in his terminal niceness.</p>
        <p>Imprisoned by words (or structural linguistics), paralyzed by fear of feeling, obsessed with agreeability and embarrassed by physical contact, Philip, who has an anagram handy for every phrase, personifies the curse of the verbal life.</p>
        <p>In a less-than-stimulating season, it is an act of philanthropy indeed for the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven to revive this early work of Mr. Hampton, who has become best known for his stage and screen adaptations of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," to prove that the play has improved with time and to find in Tim Choate a disarming, ideal Philip, the role that was first memorably taken by Alec McCowen.</p>
        <p>The physicality of Mr. Choate's performance is captivating, and it is thoughtful of the actor to stop just short of being completely irresistible. He appears to build obstacles in space and to stumble over everyone. Clutching a box of corn flakes, he overturns it -- the whole box -- into a bowl. Vacantly, he watches it overflow.</p>
        <p>Mixing clumsiness and colorlessness, he is told by his fiancee, Celia (Gillian Anderson), "You are so incredibly bland, you just sit there like a pudding, wobbling gently." When Celia wants a retort, she knows she'll get a simile, or a debate instead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Choate's characterization is so complete that it reveals all possibilities of despair and reflects the utter pointlessness of those around him. If Philip is in his own void, no one else seems better off. Not Don (Sam Tsoutsouvas), who wallows in uselessness, and not the mercenary novelist Braham (Ronald Guttman), who trades on arrogance. To them Philip, with his blunt cheerfulness, is an ever-present threat.</p>
        <p>If entertaining, witty talk were all, and Mr. Hampton's play overflows with it, "The Philanthropist" would be a civilized welcome diversion. But the play has substance, satirical edge and two enormously theatrical surprises -- one at the beginning, one at the end.</p>
        <p>As influenced by Pirandello as he was inspired by Moliere, Mr. Hampton takes aim at the insular academic life, the pretentious, heartless and decadent literary set, against the background of suicide, arson and political assassinations. In its premiere, the play was projected onto the "near future." In this production, the time is "now." The prophesy of numbed disconnectedness couldn't have been more prophetic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Anderson, blase and perturbable, is just the Celia to give a jolt to any other man. But it's a pity that Gordon Edelstein's otherwise classy direction allows Margaret Gibson, the would-be seducer of Philip, to negate an overdone role by overdoing it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsoutsouvas and Mr. Guttman give stylish performances; Lily Knight stirs interest in a silent role, and between-the-scenes selections -- Bach, Mozart, the Clash -- are theatrically apt. "The Philanthropist" is a shrewdly timed antidote to the nattering of Edward Albee's forlorn characters in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" at the Hartford Stage. In both plays, brainy survivors of faculty fun and games are entrapped by enlightenment, but here is the place for articulation lessons.</p>
