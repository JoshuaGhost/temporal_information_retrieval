        <p>The President from Moscow went to Camp David. He talked to President Bush about arms control, economic reform and world peace. He received high-powered members of Congress at his embassy. He roared through town in his Zil limousine surrounded by security agents in fur hats. He pressed the flesh on a Washington street corner.</p>
        <p>It was a familiar, almost predictable sequence of events. But this was Boris N. Yeltsin, not Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and if it was East-West summitry, then it was in miniature.</p>
        <p>Thousands thronged downtown Washington at lunchtime to see Mr. Gorbachev, who made unannounced street-corner stops his political trademark on two visits here. Today, about 20 people huddled on a windy corner near the spot where Mr. Yeltsin's helicopter was to land, most of them caught up by the roadblock with little idea of who was arriving.</p>
        <p>And it all took place in about six hours instead of two or three days, a speed more appropriate for two of Mr. Bush's golf rounds than for a Russian leader's visit, as Mr. Yeltsin hurtled today through his hastily arranged and even more hastily executed visit to the capital.</p>
        <p>There was a formal paper to sign, the "Camp David Declaration," in which Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush promised their nations would stop being "potential adversaries" and become friends. There was a sense that this was a significant moment in the two countries' new relationship.</p>
        <p>But there were no long receiving lines and glittery state dinners at the White House. The Marine Corps Band was not there to play "Ruffles and Flourishes." There was no red carpet or color guard. All that will be saved for the "real" Bush-Yeltsin summit meeting, to be held here in the spring.</p>
        <p>Today's quick trip seemed intended by both sides to have Mr. Yeltsin touch all of Mr. Gorbachev's bases and let the world know that the new Russian President was taking over all of the former Soviet President's roles, including the up-close-and-personal relationship with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>"Gorbachev went to Camp David, so Yeltsin's going to Camp David," a White House aide had said on Friday. "Gorbachev met with the Congressional leadership, so Yeltsin's going to do that. We want to make sure that we know he knows we're taking him seriously." He's Come a Long Way</p>
        <p>In his autobiography, "Against the Grain," Mr. Yeltsin writes of his childhood in rural Russia: "We lived in near poverty, in a small house, with one cow. We did have a horse, but when it died, we were left without an animal to pull the plow."</p>
        <p>In 1935, the cow died too.</p>
        <p>Fifty-seven years later, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Russia's answer to the prairie populist, spent more than three hours with George Herbert Walker Bush at Camp David, the hideaway in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland that is one of the enduring symbols of American Presidential power.</p>
        <p>As they drove away in one of Mr. Bush's beloved golf carts, the two Presidents seemed an odd pairing. Mr. Bush, the product of Andover and Yale, drove, with Mr. Yeltsin, with his silver hair and prizefighter looks, sitting beside him and looking just a bit ill at ease in his Camp David-correct turquoise golf shirt and casual tan jacket. Mrs. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, followed along in another golf cart, this one driven by a Secret Service agent.</p>
        <p>During the meeting, Mr. Bush gave Mr. Yeltsin a pair of hand-tooled cowboy boots from Houston that bore a silver map of Russia and American and Russian flags. The American President also produced a birthday cake with one candle for the Russian President, who turned 61 today.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yeltsin did not seem interested in gifts. "The best present is meeting President George Bush at Camp David," he told reporters as he arrived at the retreat. First Things First</p>
        <p>As Mr. Yeltsin returned to Washington from Camp David, he paused between his Zil limousine and the Marine Corps helicopter that had delivered him, with the seal of the American President on its door.</p>
        <p>He looked at the car that was to whisk him away to a meeting with lawmakers.</p>
        <p>He looked at the small crowd that had gathered nearby chanting, "Boris! Boris! Boris!"</p>
        <p>He looked back at the car.</p>
        <p>The Congressional leaders were waiting.</p>
        <p>In a split second, the instincts of the populist politician took over and Mr. Yeltsin, grinning broadly, walked over to the crowd. "Spasibo," he shouted his thanks as he moved along, shaking hands and submitting to picture taking. "Spasibo. Spasibo."</p>
        <p>"The man's got a strong handshake," said an enthused Steven Frost, a firefighter from Redding, Calif., who happened to wander by and described himself as "optimistically skeptical" at all the talk of Russian-American friendship. "He's O.K. We can talk to him."</p>
