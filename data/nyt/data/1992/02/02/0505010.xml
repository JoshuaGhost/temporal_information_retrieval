        <p>CLINT MALARCHUK, the Buffalo Sabres' goalie, has a powerful new anecdote for his lectures warning youngsters about the dangers of drugs and alcohol: a first-hand account suggesting that that alcohol and medication don't mix.</p>
        <p>Malarchuk, who has been nursing a bad back and who was hospitalized for bleeding ulcers earlier this month, has been taking pain medication.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, he had a few beers at a Super Bowl party. When he got home and took his usual medication, he said, he got violently sick. So sick, in fact, that all Malarchuk wanted to do was go to sleep. The best way to do that, he thought, was to have another drink.</p>
        <p>When he woke up in the hospital the next morning, he was told he had been taken there after passing out and that doctors had pumped his stomach. (AP)</p>
