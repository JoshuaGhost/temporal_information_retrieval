        <p>Efforts by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to steer Pakistan's economy away from state planning and toward free markets and privatization are being threatened by Islamic fundamentalism.</p>
        <p>Last year, the country's highest Islamic court declared that all forms of interest, or "riba," on bank loans, deposits, international borrowing and lending were "repugnant" to Islam and ruled that Pakistan must abolish such interest by June. Ignored at the time, the ruling is now being viewed with increasing alarm by more moderate members of the Government and by foreign lenders and investors.</p>
        <p>Some Government officials are portraying any carrying out of the ruling in near-apocolyptic terms. "The whole financial system of the country will collapse," said Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali, minister of state for economic affairs. "The foreign donors are getting a little edgy. Our own banking system is getting nervous. It's very serious."</p>
        <p>Already, several of country's largest public works projects, financed by foreign lending, are in jeopardy. A $1.45 billion hydroelectric dam being built on the Hab River has been stalled, and a $980 million superhighway being built by the South Koreans is in danger. Campaign Promise to Islam</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharif rode to power 16 months ago partly on his promises to bring Islam in all its facets fully into the life of the country. Placating religious fundamentalists is a time-honored tradition for politicians here, and Mr. Sharif hammered on the theme of Islamicization throughout his campaign.</p>
        <p>Now, with the ruling on riba, Government officials say privately that the Prime Minister is losing his patience with the extremism that his promises have given birth to. Even The Muslim, a fairly orthodox newspaper, has argued editorially that the court decision is un-Islamic and that Mr. Sharif must confront the fundamentalists.</p>
        <p>"If he had the strength of his inner convictions, the Prime Minister could have tamed the restive elements at the very start," the paper said. "Mr. Nawaz Sharif knows, or ought to, that the row over riba, kicked up by the so-called religious lobby, is artificially contrived and is totally without any foundation in reason, common sense or Islamic jurisprudence."</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Pakistan's fundamentalists are proceeding full-steam with the expectation that the court ruling will take effect and that the country will be the first to outlaw all interest. Even Saudi Arabia, one of the most rigid Islamic states, has sidestepped the issue by calling interest "profit" or "service charges." But in Pakistan, this approach does not seem to satisfy the leaders of Jamat-e-Islami, the fundamentalist political party that is part of the governing coalition.</p>
        <p>"This decision cannot be overturned," said Qazi Hussain, the leader of Jamat. "Our economy will be more prosperous. We will be rid of corrupt people who take loans and who burden the national exchequer."</p>
        <p>A Commission on the Islamicization of the Economy has been established to devise the rules and procedures for financial transactions without interest. Elites vs. Religious</p>
        <p>The growing threat to the existing banking and financial system reflects the larger tensions in Pakistani society between Western-oriented political and business elites, and the orthodox religious parties with roots in the mosques and villages of the country.</p>
        <p>Since the military coup by Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in 1977, Pakistan's leaders have sought to cloak their regimes in the legitimacy of Islam by giving free rein to the fundamentalist mullahs. As a result, fundamentalist clerics have exercised influence on Pakistani politics far out of proportion to any demonstrated widespread support.</p>
        <p>Although the fundamentalists have managed to garner only a handful of seats in the National Assembly, it is often maintained that their power stems from their ability to provoke huge street protests that could topple the Government. But even this conventional wisdom, according to diplomats here, is open to question.</p>
        <p>"People think Jamat can get the crowds on the streets," said a senior Western diplomat here. "There isn't much proof of that. During the gulf war, there were only tiny demonstrations in support of Iraq. But people are fearful of their organizational ability."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ali, the minister for economic affairs, said that as relations with the United States and the West remain tense, the fundamentalists have become even more assertive. 'A Fear Psychosis'</p>
        <p>"There's a fear psychosis, and they create it," he said. "And the more we're squeezed, the stronger these guys get."</p>
        <p>"We have this Pressler thing," he continued, referring to a United States law that cut off all aid to Pakistan because of its nuclear program, "and this has really given ammunition to these guys. At every stage they become a little stronger."</p>
        <p>So nervous is the Government about confronting the fundamentalists that it has refused to appeal the interest ruling directly, instead allowing several banks to appeal instead. What the outcome of the appeal will be is uncertain, but Mr. Ali said the choice was clear.</p>
        <p>"We have to decide whether we want to go towards the fanatical, obscurantist Islam of the mullahs or whether we want Islam of Iqbal and Jinnah," he said, referring to Sir Muhammad Iqbal, a philosopher who sought to combine Western philosophy with Islam, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founder. "We cannot leave the decision pending any longer."</p>
