        <p>Who's the best girl goaltender in the state of New Jersey playing for a boys' high school hockey team? If you go by yesterday's unprecedented head-to-head battle between two female goalies, Liz Hill of Lawrence and Claudine Pietrucha of Verona, the undisputed title goes to Pietrucha.</p>
        <p>She turned aside 56 of 62 shots in a 6-5 loss yesterday in a state tournament game at the Mercer County Park in West Windsor. Hill managed to stop 12 of only 17 shots. The victory propelled Lawrence into the first round against Seton Hall Prep on Monday.</p>

        <p>Who's the best girl goaltender in the state of New Jersey playing for a boys' high school hockey team? If you go by yesterday's unprecedented head-to-head battle between two female goalies, Liz Hill of Lawrence and Claudine Pietrucha of Verona, the undisputed title goes to Pietrucha.</p>
        <p>She turned aside 56 of 62 shots in a 6-5 loss yesterday in a state tournament game at the Mercer County Park in West Windsor. Hill managed to stop 12 of only 17 shots. The victory propelled Lawrence into the first round against Seton Hall Prep on Monday.</p>
        <p>"Tonight was Claudine's night," said Rich D'Amato, the coach of Lawrence, when forced to rate the goalies. "She really shined. Liz didn't have a very good game at all. In fact, I had to pull her in the third period."</p>
        <p>With Lawrence trailing, 5-4, early in the final session, D'Amato replaced Hill with freshman Dan Hodgkinson. The Cardinals responded with goals from Max Nutkowitz and the winner from Carl Lester.</p>
        <p>The luck of the draw brought together the only girls starting in goal for a boys' team in the state. "It was a freak show out there," D'Amato said of all the hype. "There were three different television stations and tons of newspaper reporters."</p>
