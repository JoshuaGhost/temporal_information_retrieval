        <p>Three executives of a Queens company that the New York City Housing Authority paid $9.6 million for construction work were indicted yesterday on charges they secretly funneled more than $1 million in profits to an associate of the reputed Mafia leader John Gotti.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities said the $1 million from city funds was used to help build and run a $5 million, thoroughbred-breeding farm in Florida for Anthony J.

        <p>Three executives of a Queens company that the New York City Housing Authority paid $9.6 million for construction work were indicted yesterday on charges they secretly funneled more than $1 million in profits to an associate of the reputed Mafia leader John Gotti.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities said the $1 million from city funds was used to help build and run a $5 million, thoroughbred-breeding farm in Florida for Anthony J. Gurino, who law-enforcement officials say is an associate of the Gambino organized-crime family and who was among the six people indicted yesterday.</p>
        <p>Housing Authority officials acknowledged yesterday that they were unaware for almost two years that the company, Hi-Tech Mechanical Inc. of Astoria, was a front for Mr. Gurino, although it had been banned in 1987 from city work because of suspected mob ties.</p>
        <p>But a Federal prosecutor in Florida, Jerry Sanford, said that as part of an investigation of Mr. Gurino the authority was asked last May to continue doing business with Hi-Tech and that authority investigators helped to expose a purported money-laundering scheme.</p>
        <p>Gene R. Lopez, the Authority's Inspector General, said the agency would seek to recover as much as possible of the $9.6 million that was paid to Hi-Tech, possibly through seizure of its assets and Mr. Gurino's 113-acre farm in Morriston, Fla.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Hi-Tech, Benjamin Brafman, said that Federal prosecutors in Florida had "tortured the facts" to obtain the indictments. He denied that Mr. Gurino controlled the company or that any funds were siphoned to him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brafman said Mr. Gotti and Mr. Gurino had been friends since boyhood and that Mr. Gurino "has been persecuted" by law-enforcement authorities because he had once employed Mr. Gotti as a plumbing salesman. Mr. Gotti, who is the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, is on trial on Federal murder and racketeering charges in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The Housing Authority is an independent body whose top officials are appointed by the Mayor and which receives most of its construction funds from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The authority's former chairwoman, Laura D. Blackburne, resigned last Saturday after disclosures that she authorized hundreds of thousands of dollars to be spent on office furnishings and business trips.</p>
        <p>From July 1990 to last December, the authority awarded Hi-Tech 29 contracts, mainly for plumbing installation and repairs, totaling $18.1 million. Its new chairwoman, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, yesterday canceled the 13 remaining contracts and said payments for $608,000 in completed work would be halted. An $884,777 contract with the Sanitation Department was also canceled.</p>
        <p>Hi-Tech managed to get contracts with the Housing Authority and the Sanitation Department although it has been under an investigative spotlight since it was incorporated in 1986.</p>
        <p>The president of Hi-Tech, Patrick J. Borello, and its vice president, Augusto Aufiero, had previously been employees of the Arc Plumbing and Heating Company, which was owned by Mr. Gurino. Hi-Tech was banned from city work in 1987 on grounds that it had been established as a front by Mr. Gurino to get new contracts.</p>
        <p>In charges unsealed yesterday in Gainesville, Fla. Mr. Gurino was indicted on 21 counts that dummy companies were used to divert Hi-Tech funds to his farm. Mr. Gurino, who was convicted last year of obstruction of justice in a narcotics case, is serving a five-year sentence in a Federal prison in Otisville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Also indicted on the same laundering and fraud charges were Mr. Gurino's wife, Barbara Ann Gurino, and their son, Louis. The Hi-Tech officials indicted were Vincent Sorena, the chief executive officers of Atratech, the parent company of Hi-Tech, and Mr. Borello and Mr. Aufiero.</p>
