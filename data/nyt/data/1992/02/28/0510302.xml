        <p>"We don't seem straightforward, but we are, really," says Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, the British-Irish band that is to perform tomorrow night at the Ritz.</p>
        <p>"Straightforward" may be the last word most listeners would use to describe the band's current album, "Loveless." The songs sound molten, edgeless; both the beat and the vocals are inundated by noise, some of it from guitars, some of it from less definable sources. Within the clouds and swamps of sound are three-chord rock songs and words sung earnestly by Mr. Shields or ethereally by Belinda Butcher, but the focus is radically different from most rock music.</p>

        <p>"We don't seem straightforward, but we are, really," says Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, the British-Irish band that is to perform tomorrow night at the Ritz.</p>
        <p>"Straightforward" may be the last word most listeners would use to describe the band's current album, "Loveless." The songs sound molten, edgeless; both the beat and the vocals are inundated by noise, some of it from guitars, some of it from less definable sources. Within the clouds and swamps of sound are three-chord rock songs and words sung earnestly by Mr. Shields or ethereally by Belinda Butcher, but the focus is radically different from most rock music.</p>
        <p>My Bloody Valentine got started in 1984, influenced at first by bands like the Cramps, the Birthday Party and the Gun Club, which combined the twang of rockabilly with a penchant for dark, hallucinatory imagery. Three years later, when Ms. Butcher joined My Bloody Valentine, the band began to find its own approach. "The only stuff we can barely stand by is the stuff we've done since 1987," Mr. Shields said. "Before that, I was just playing guitar. When I started to sing, it gave me the freedom to do anything I wanted with the guitar, because I didn't have to worry about a singer trying to sing along. Since Belinda joined the band, we've shared the singing about 50-50."</p>
        <p>In England, My Bloody Valentine is a pioneer of what is sometimes called dream-pop. Along with the Jesus and Mary Chain and such American groups as Sonic Youth and Husker Du, the band has taught a wave of newer bands -- among them, Blur, Lush, Ride, Curve and Swervedriver -- that veiled, slightly mysterious songs can draw listeners in. But My Bloody Valentine remains more radical and more disorienting than the bands it has influenced; parts of "Loveless" manage to sound as if the CD itself has been warped. In an age of digital clarity, My Bloody Valentine might be the revenge of the analogue.</p>
        <p>"What we're doing is not really a reaction against modern times," said Mr. Shields, the band's founder, guitarist and songwriter. "It's just that people got obsessed with the idea of separation to make music sound really sparkling and clear. But if you hear music in a room, it's not sparkling and clear. It's got depth, perhaps, but the instruments also have to mesh. Cleanness in music may be something that's worthwhile pursuing -- there's no harm in it -- but it doesn't represent anything other than cleanness."</p>
        <p>Mr. Shields said that My Bloody Valentine's music uses "the best technology we can get our hands on," including digital samplers to manipulate sounds like strings and flutes.  But despite the density of the songs, he said, they are not created through high-tech studio tinkering.</p>
        <p>"It's a product of the times, but it's not dependent on the times," he added. "About 75 percent of the music could have been done any time between 1960 and now. People have this idea that it's layers and layers of guitars to make one big sound, but it's usually just one or two, and perhaps three or four at a peak. There aren't lots and lots of overdubs."</p>
        <p>On stage, My Bloody Valentine is a basic four-piece band of two guitars, bass and drums. "We just leave a few bits out," Mr. Shields said.</p>
        <p>Before the release of "Loveless" late in 1991, My Bloody Valentine had put out only one album, "Isn't Anything," and a series of EPs, all on independent English and European labels. Mr. Shields said that recording for small companies allowed the band to find its own sound.</p>
        <p>"They don't give you anything, so they have no opinion," he said. "They don't give you any money, they put you in a studio for two or three days and they take what comes out. By the time we were in a position with anything at stake, we knew what we wanted to sound like.</p>
        <p>"Now, people don't comment on the production, simply because it's all part of what we're about. You can't simply have 'cleaner' versions of the songs, because that would lose a lot of what we're about."</p>
        <p>"There's no point in making music just to be commercial, especially if you're in our position," he added. "It's not, like, if you put the vocalist up front you're going to sell a couple of million records. We're much better off ignoring that stuff. And we don't want to be a different version of what we're about, because we're just doing what we're doing. We're never sure how things will turn out, but we've followed this route for a long time."</p>
        <p>My Bloody Valentine is to perform tomorrow night with Dinosaur Jr., which has become a star of the collegiate-rock circuit by singing about uncertainty and withdrawal amid blaring guitars. Screaming Trees opens the concert at 9 P.M., followed by My Bloody Valentine at about 10 and Dinosaur Jr. at about 11. The Ritz is at 254 West 54th Street in Manhattan; the telephone number is (212) 541-8900. Tickets are $12.50 in advance, $15 tomorrow.</p>
