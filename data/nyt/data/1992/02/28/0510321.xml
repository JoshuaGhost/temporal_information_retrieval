        <p>"The Substance of Fire," originally produced by Playwrights Horizons, has reopened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1991.</p>
        <p>One need not be a jaded constituent of New York's literati to recognize Isaac Geldhart, the esteemed publisher and embattled Jewish father who stands at the center of "The Substance of Fire," the new play by Jon Robin Baitz. A childhood refugee from the "wrecked world" of the Holocaust, Isaac came to New York an orphan, reinvented himself as a bon vivant, and found fame and fortune as a rigorously independent champion of literary books that wouldn't be caught dead on a best-seller list. By the late 1980's, when Mr. Baitz's play unfolds, Isaac has long since been a brand name in the culture industry. He is one of those survivors, of post-war American intellectual firestorms no less than Old Europe's bloodbaths, who run Manhattan with an iron tongue.</p>

        <p>"The Substance of Fire," originally produced by Playwrights Horizons, has reopened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center. Following are excerpts from Frank Rich's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1991.</p>
        <p>One need not be a jaded constituent of New York's literati to recognize Isaac Geldhart, the esteemed publisher and embattled Jewish father who stands at the center of "The Substance of Fire," the new play by Jon Robin Baitz. A childhood refugee from the "wrecked world" of the Holocaust, Isaac came to New York an orphan, reinvented himself as a bon vivant, and found fame and fortune as a rigorously independent champion of literary books that wouldn't be caught dead on a best-seller list. By the late 1980's, when Mr. Baitz's play unfolds, Isaac has long since been a brand name in the culture industry. He is one of those survivors, of post-war American intellectual firestorms no less than Old Europe's bloodbaths, who run Manhattan with an iron tongue.</p>
        <p>It is the searing achievement of "The Substance of Fire" that it keeps chipping and chipping away at its protagonist until finally he and the century that shaped him and then reshaped him are exposed to the tragic quick. As written with both scrupulous investigative zeal and bottomless sympathy by Mr. Baitz and as acted in a career-transforming performance by Ron Rifkin, Isaac Geldhart is one of the most memorable and troubling characters to appear onstage this season.</p>
        <p>He is also the harbinger of what is likely to be a major playwriting career. Mr. Baitz is going to write better plays than "The Substance of Fire," but his writing is already so articulate, witty and true that it's only a matter of time before his theatrical know-how, some of which must come with experience, catches up with his talent.</p>
        <p>Though this play wanders all over the place during its two enthralling hours, nearly every place it visits is of interest. In Act I, Mr. Rifkin's congenitally combative Isaac is placed in a typical family-business conflict: to save his increasingly insolvent firm from Japanese takeover sharks, he must browbeat his three adult children into philosophical and financial submission. In Act II, set a few years later, what seemed to be a potentially high-charged boardroom drama is all but forgotten while Mr. Baitz forces Isaac to confront the demons that would destroy him from within.</p>
        <p>All of Isaac's struggles date back to the war in which his parents died in the camps while he escaped incarceration. If Isaac has survivor's guilt, he also has a survivor's arrogant omnipotence. Mr. Rifkin presents the publisher as a figure of dazzling intellectual authority who never hesitates to remind all listeners that in an America where so many people dispose of their history and convictions for expediency's sake, he has kept the "fire" ignited by his youth, the spirit that keeps him sticking up for the highest standards in morality and literature alike. Even his attractive and accomplished children do not escape his bullying condescension.</p>
        <p>Yet for all Isaac's nastiness, it is hard to dislike him. He is just too smart and funny and, on occasion, too right to be dismissed. Once Mr. Baitz ruthlessly challenges the premises of Isaac's life -- examining the real meaning of his survival, the substance of his "fire" -- the audience is caught up in the sad reckoning facing him in late middle age. Is Isaac's proud insistence on holding on to his past the choice that allowed him to survive, or is it a burden that robbed him of any hope for happiness?</p>
        <p>"I thought that if I published Hazlitt and Svevo, I'd be spared," says Isaac in Act II. But he has not been spared: if the Nazis destroyed his family in Europe, he has "trashed" his own family, effectively if not as definitively, in New York. Not for nothing does he pore over some prized illustrated letters -- "gestures of love" by other witnesses to the "bloodthirsty century" like Osip Mandelstam and George Grosz -- with a teary intimacy he cannot achieve with his own children. Just as pointedly does the "most crucial part" of Isaac's collection of ephemera prove to be a watercolor postcard painted by the young Hitler in Vienna at a time when he "fancied himself a serious artist." Does Hitler's painting make a mockery of all humane connections between life and art? If so, is it possible that the life of literature that Isaac has invented in New York is an escape from life rather than life itself, just as the love of books is a flight from love?</p>
        <p>In Daniel Sullivan's flawless production, every performance is finely shaded. It says much about all three actors playing the Geldhart children -- Sarah Jessica Parker, Patrick Breen, Jon Tenney -- that they can stand up to Mr. Rifkin, whose caustic humor and infernal anger seem to be forces of nature. It says much about "The Substance of Fire" that when it is Isaac's turn to be flattened by life's blows, Mr. Baitz does not provide the satisfaction of a bully getting his comeuppance, just the ineffable melancholy of a flame flickering out. This is a deeply compassionate play, as imperfect as it is youthful, by a writer who with one play or another is bound to be embraced by the wrecked world.</p>
