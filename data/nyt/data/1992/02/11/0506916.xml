        <p>WITH oil exploration and production in decline in the United States, American companies are stepping up these activities abroad. But companies that risk millions elsewhere in the world on new wells -- many of which come up dry -- are showing unusual reluctance to invest in Russia's rich fields.</p>
        <p>Several reasons are offered by American oil executives. One, of course, is political instability. Another is high Russian taxes on oil exports. A third is the huge costs of roads and pipelines to ship the oil and housing and schools for workers, which companies are expected to finance. Finally there is a gnawing doubt: Even though the commonwealth needs foreign capital and oilfield technology now, will it still need the help a few years from now?</p>
        <p>To one degree or another, these obstacles also exist in other parts of the world, yet American oil executives are more relaxed about them. Why do they dwell on them here?</p>
        <p>In a dozen interviews with a group of American oil executives who traveled from the United States to the huge western Siberian fields for talks with Russian oil managers, the view that emerged was that Russia is different. The turmoil here is beyond the control of outsiders. And the distrust engendered by the cold war is not easily shaken off by a generation of oil executives who have spent their adult lives in its grip.</p>
        <p>"You don't want to make a big up-front investment here and have it taken away from you," said Robert E. Ebel, a vice president at the Enserch Corporation, a Dallas company with oil operations. "In Latin America, if there is a dictator and you know him and there are laws, you can manage. Here we have no protection: no tax treaty, no investment treaty, no trade agreement. Nothing is in place."</p>
        <p>Except the oil. Nowhere outside the Middle East are there such huge oil reserves as in Russia's vast Siberian territory -- the source of most of the oil that the commonwealth currently produces -- and in the republic of Kazakhstan to the south. If American oil companies do not come forward, they run perhaps the bigger risk of losing out to European competitors in the scramble for oil reserves that international oil companies need to prosper.</p>
        <p>American oil companies once were bolder, but now have become too bureaucratic, says George Helland, a former Texas oil chief and now a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, which organized the expedition to west Siberia. "How often in a major corporation today do you find the individual chief executive making a decision and acting on it, as opposed to the C.E.O. proposing something and then discussing it with his staff," Mr. Helland said.</p>
        <p>Small companies, American and European, are so far the most active here, investing no more than $50 million apiece, typically in joint ventures with Russian companies. These ventures increase the output of existing wells or drill new ones to pump oil already discovered by the Russians. The major American oil companies -- Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, -- are holding back, in some cases negotiating to drill test wells, while seeking guarantees before they spend as much as $1.5 billion a year in vast exploration and pumping projects.</p>
        <p>Currently the big concern in these protracted discussions is Russian taxes. Under recent decrees, foreign oil companies could be forced to pay the Government as much as 75 percent of their dollar revenue from exporting the oil they receive in return for their investments. However, Russian officials have suggested that foreign investors may be exempted from this tax.</p>
        <p>But another headache is appearing: Foreign capital and technology, eagerly sought today, might not be so necessary by the late 1990's. Russian and American oil experts both say that Russia could probably raise enough capital on its own, if its huge output -- more than nine million barrels a day -- were sold at the world market price, now $18 a barrel. Instead, most of the oil, being Government-owned, is still distributed within the commonwealth for below $1 a barrel.</p>
        <p>More important, American oil people are discovering that the Russian need for foreign technology is not as great as originally assumed. That has been the experience of two American partners, Anglo-Suisse in Houston and Phibro Energy Inc., in a pioneering joint venture called White Knights in several fields in Raduzhny, Siberia.</p>
        <p>Only American drilling rigs were used at first, until the American partners found that Russian rigs were less costly and good enough, particularly when upgraded with American-made drill bits and the use of various Western techniques. Today, four of the six White Knights rigs are Russian-made.</p>
        <p>As an American engineer in Raduzhny put it, "What is happening in Russia is not much different than in the North Sea, where Americans went in first with their superior offshore technology and the British and the Norwegians caught up."</p>
