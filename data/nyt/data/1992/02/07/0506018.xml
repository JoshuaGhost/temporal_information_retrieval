        <p>Busy Becomes Busier</p>
        <p>Jeremy Irons's life isn't Kafkaesque. It's just busy.</p>
        <p>Not only is he currently starring in Steven Soderbergh's "Kafka," but he has also completed a feature film and a television project and, in a week or so, he will begin work under the direction of Louis Malle in "Damage."</p>
        <p>That film is based on a 1991 first novel of the same name, by Josephine Hart, a best-selling tale of erotic obsession in which an aristocratic member of Britain's Parliament falls in love with a mysterious woman who is his son's fiancee.</p>
        <p>"I thought it was a wonderful story, full of very dark passion, and I wanted to work with Louis Malle for a long time," said Mr. Irons, who won an Academy Award last year for his portrayal of Claus von Bulow in "Reversal of Fortune."</p>
        <p>Mr. Irons said his involvement in "Damage" began early last year, when he and Mr. Malle met in Los Angeles, where the director of such films as "Au Revoir les Enfants," "Atlantic City" and "Lacombe, Lucien" gave him a copy of Miss Hart's novel.</p>
        <p>"He got David Hare, the English playwright, to write the script," Mr. Irons said. And then Mr. Malle cast Juliette Binoche, perhaps best known as Tereza in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," as the mysterious woman, and Rupert Graves ("A Room With a View") as the son.</p>
        <p>Filming is to take place in London, Paris, the South of France and Brussels, Mr. Irons said.</p>
        <p>He added that he had just finished appearing in the feature film "Waterland" and in the television production "Tales From Hollywood." In "Waterland," he said: "I play a history teacher who lives in Pittsburgh and comes to a crisis point in his marriage because of not facing up to a momentous event that happened very early in their relationship. He averts, or maybe has, a nervous breakdown by talking his class through his life."</p>
        <p>And in "Tales From Hollywood," written by Christopher Hampton, Mr. Irons appears with his wife, Sinead Cusack, and Alec Guinness, in a story about the German writers who went to Hollywood before World War II.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irons said he was a bit reluctant to talk about future projects. But he ventured a guess that he would next turn up in "M. Butterfly," directed by David Cronenberg, for whom Mr. Irons portrayed the eerie twin gynecologists in "Dead Ringers."  On 'Untitled 1992'</p>
        <p>Try, for the moment, to put yourself in the shoes of Mike Leigh, even though he is probably in London right now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leigh is the English film maker whose movies -- including "High Hopes" and "Life Is Sweet" -- win critical acclaim and prizes. "Life Is Sweet," for example, captured awards from the National Society of Film Critics for the best film of 1991, best actress (Alison Steadman) andbest supporting actress (Jane Horrocks).</p>
        <p>But "High Hopes," an indictment of Thatcherite England, and "Life Is Sweet," a gastronomic comedy about a family in a London suburb, were not made in a conventional way. They are the product of long rehearsals in which the actors help to discover and create the characters.</p>
        <p>It's not a process that makes it easy for Mr. Leigh to raise money, because often he is not in a position to tell potential investors what his next film will be about.</p>
        <p>"You're lucky in a sense," he said of his film-making method. "I've never made a film before where I could answer anything but, 'No, I don't,' because that's usually the case.</p>
        <p>"I sort of keep it as open as possible," he said, "and spend a lot of time with actors, investigate character and relationship and build the whole thing up. And the film comes out of that in a very disciplined way.</p>
        <p>"It's different this time, because people are reluctant to part with money anyhow for films, even if you give them a script that shows them every single shot. Far less eager are they to part with a bean if you refuse to tell them anything, and that's always been the problem.</p>
        <p>"So because of that, there's been a sort of low-budget ceiling on the amount of money I've been able to get to make films. There's nothing wrong with that, but to do something with a slightly different canvas, it's hard to raise the dough. I've got to give them a bit.</p>
        <p>"The notion I've sort of come up with is it's a film that will in some way involve flight attendants, people working on planes. It's 'Untitled 1992.' 'Life Is Sweet' was called 'Untitled '90.' "</p>
        <p>"Life Is Sweet" cost about $2.8 million. "Untitled 1992" would cost about $5 million, he said, adding that he had no cast and nothing in writing, but that he expected to begin filming in the fall.</p>
        <p>"Having said that," he went on, "I'm not going to tell you anything else, because there's nothing else to tell you."  Decade From Hong Kong</p>
        <p>"Cinema of Blazing Passions: Hong Kong Films in the 80's."</p>
        <p>That's the title of the retrospective that will begin on Wednesday at the Eighth Street Playhouse in Manhattan, where 12 films selected from more than 2,000 Hong Kong films made during the 1980's are to be presented. Included in the series, ending Feb. 25, are dramas, ghost stories, comedies, action films and mixtures of the genres.</p>
        <p>Under the auspices of Asian Cinevision, the nonprofit Asian-American media arts center at 32 East Broadway, the retrospective will consist of double features beginning with Tsui Hark's "Shanghai Blues," a love story with a bitter political edge that was selected by the Hong Kong critics as one of the 10 best films of 1984, and Ann Hui's "Boat People."</p>
        <p>"Boat People," an expose of the Communist years in postwar Vietnam, won awards as the best Hong Kong film of 1982, the award for the year's best director and the Hong Kong Film Critics award as 1 of that year's 10 best.</p>
        <p>"Cinema of Blazing Passions" will travel to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston and Washington.</p>
