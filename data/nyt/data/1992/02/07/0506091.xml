        <p>President Bush has dispatched Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, on an unpublicized mission to consult with leaders in Egypt and Saudi Arabia on United States efforts to hasten the downfall of President Saddam Hussein, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Some officials insisted that Mr. Gates's trip, which began on Tuesday with a stop in Cairo, was an inaugural tour of C.I.A. posts in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel and an opportunity for the director to develop "liaison relationships" with allied intelligence chiefs.</p>

        <p>President Bush has dispatched Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, on an unpublicized mission to consult with leaders in Egypt and Saudi Arabia on United States efforts to hasten the downfall of President Saddam Hussein, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Some officials insisted that Mr. Gates's trip, which began on Tuesday with a stop in Cairo, was an inaugural tour of C.I.A. posts in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel and an opportunity for the director to develop "liaison relationships" with allied intelligence chiefs.</p>
        <p>But others said Mr. Gates was selected as a special emissary of Mr. Bush for political discussions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia on the diplomatic, military and covert action that can be taken as sanctions weaken the Iraqi leader. The agenda for his talks with Israeli leaders was unclear.  A Twofold Approach</p>
        <p>The details of the talks could not be learned, but they are believed to involve two different aspects. One is a discussion of the secret planning said to be going on about efforts to bring about the overthrow of Iraq's President. The other is the more public plan to use military pressure under Security Council authority if Iraq continues to obstruct United Nations inspectors trying to find and dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and the industries related to them.</p>
        <p>One official said the United States was giving serious consideration to a "demonstration" bombing raid, with Security Council support, against an Iraqi military target like an arms factory or a suspected chemical weapons plant. Officials hope that such an attack would further humiliate Mr. Hussein and embolden what they describe as restive military leaders to move against him. Bush Seeks a Coalition</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates's consultations were said to be an outgrowth of a decision last month by Mr. Bush to begin laying the foundation for increasing pressure against Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush was in New York last week for the meeting of Security Council heads of state, a senior Administration official told reporters that Mr. Bush was attempting in those talks to gather support for further punitive action against Iraq if it continued to obstruct enforcement of the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war. The terms include the destruction of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs.</p>
        <p>This followed Mr. Bush's statement on Jan. 16 saluting "the efforts of thousands of brave Iraqis who are resisting Saddam's rule both inside and outside of Iraq."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush appears to be trying to help foster a coup in Iraq and thus consolidate the military victory of the American-led alliance a year ago.</p>
        <p>An Administration official said that with more intrusive United Nations inspections and demands for information, the United States and its allies are trying to push Mr. Hussein into a humiliating corner in hopes that he will lash out and provide a pretext that would justify a fatal military blow to his regime. "The whole program of the inspection regime is to keep putting sand in his shorts," the official said. A Warning of Retaliation</p>
        <p>A senior Administration official warned last month that any attempt by Mr. Hussein to respond forcefully would draw an immediate response from the United States. "If he tries to do anything to strike out, he will learn again that he was sorely mistaken," the official said. "If Iraq challenges the stability of the region, it will be dealt with."</p>
        <p>Some officials who discussed Mr. Gates's mission and the political consultations he has undertaken are advocating an accelerated campaign to topple the Iraqi leader, and may hope that the disclosure itself will add to the pressure on Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>Others express concern that the Administration, in its anti-Hussein planning, is being overly influenced by the prospect that Mr. Hussein's survival could hurt Mr. Bush's chances of re-election.</p>
        <p>In November, Mr. Bush wrote to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia that the United States would maintain sufficient military power in the Persian Gulf to achieve its policy goal of toppling Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>Today, 25,000 United States troops are in the region, including 16,000 aboard 25 combat ships and 8,000 ground troops and Air Force personnel manning Patriot missiles batteries at airfields where more than 200 combat aircraft are stationed.</p>
        <p>As the Gates mission developed last week, Mr. Hussein appeared to be testing the United Nations consensus by refusing cooperation on oil sales to purchase emergency food and refusing to provide any more data on his weapons industry.</p>
        <p>One official familiar with the planning for the trip said that Mr. Gates was selected because his working visit of C.I.A. posts provided a convenient pretext for high-level and secret consultations.</p>
        <p>The travel of C.I.A. directors is not reported publicly for security reasons. In his previous job as deputy national security adviser, Mr. Gates met King Fahd and the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak. He also accompanied Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on a trip to Saudi Arabia in August 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, that persuaded King Fahd to accept United States military forces on Saudi soil.</p>
        <p>The political dimension of Mr. Gates's mission is likely to invite comparisons to the travels of the late William J. Casey, who as intelligence chief insisted that he was a policy maker in the Reagan Administration and held Cabinet rank. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Gates, who does not have Cabinet rank, endorsed the principle that the Director of Central Intelligence should serve as a neutral source of information and analysis.</p>
        <p>One Administration official said Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, and Mr. Cheney and other senior security advisers to Mr. Bush had taken part in planning Mr. Gates's presentation to the Saudi and Egyptian leaders. Mr. Scowcroft has been directing the anti-Hussein campaign in recent months. Round 1, With Mubarak</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates arrived in Cairo on Tuesday for talks with Mr. Mubarak. An official familiar with the agenda said it included a discussion of American plans to press for sanctions against Libya for the reported complicity of the Libyan intelligence service in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.</p>
        <p>Egypt has 1.5 million workers in Libya and President Mubarak has been seeking to avert a confrontation between Washington and Tripoli.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates is expected to arrive in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, by the weekend for talks with King Fahd and senior members of the royal family about the pressure campaign against Iraq.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the Saudis have become increasingly concerned that as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power, he will seize any opportunity to get revenge against Saudi Arabia, and King Fahd in particular, for turning the desert kingdom into a base for the invasion that pushed Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia has asked the United States for stepped-up intelligence monitoring of southern Iraq to detect any attempt by Mr. Hussein to position any of the hundreds of Scud missiles that he retains for an attack on Saudi targets.</p>
        <p>The Saudis also have become increasingly alarmed at intelligence reports indicating that Mr. Hussein is concealing a significant quantity of chemical weapons that he might use in desperation. Some Conflicting Intelligence</p>
        <p>One United States official said no threatening Iraqi military movements had been detected, but satellite reconnaissance continues to show Iraqi military units in drills with equipment associated with chemical warfare.</p>
        <p>Senior American officials are sympathetic to Saudi concerns about Iraqi terrorism. "There is everything to indicate they are right" in these concerns, an official said. "Saddam Hussein and King Fahd have got a personal problem and, somehow, it's got to be resolved."</p>
        <p>American contingency planning against Mr. Hussein has intensified in recent months as the Bush Administration has sought to be ready to exploit any "cracks" in Mr. Hussein's core of support in the Iraqi leadership and armed forces.</p>
        <p>In late November, Mr. Scowcroft asked the Pentagon to develop detailed plans on how the United States would respond to a request for assistance from Iraqi military commanders if they decided to mount a coup.</p>
