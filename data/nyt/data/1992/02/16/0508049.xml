        <p>Visitors to Australia who plan to stay more than three months now have to pay a $25 processing fee for their visas. Visas are free for travelers planning to stay for less than three months. The new fee, imposed Feb. 1, applies only to visa applications for one or more visits of between three and six months. The visas are valid for four years or until the applicant's passport expires. A fee of about $150 will be charged to visitors who have traveled to Australia on a free visa and wish to extend their stay to more than three months.</p>
