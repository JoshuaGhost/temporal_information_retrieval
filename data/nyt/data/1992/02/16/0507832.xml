        <p>Was James P. Johnson the invisible composer, the musical counterpart to Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man? Johnson, who died in 1955, holds the odd distinction of</p>
        <p>not</p>
        <p>being remembered as the composer of "The Charleston," the musical emblem of the roaring 20's. Jazz aficionados know him as the father of Harlem stride piano and the composer of the famous "Carolina Shout." But Johnson also composed 16 musicals, more than 200 songs, a symphony, a piano concerto, two tone poems, even an opera. Though these works parallel the achievement of his contemporary George Gershwin, they are virtually unknown.</p>
        <p>Now listeners will have a chance to discover the full range of Johnson's music this week when Jazz at Lincoln Center presents two retrospective concerts.</p>
        <p>Johnson's jazz piano style shaped the playing of his protege Thomas (Fats) Waller and the styles of Art Tatum, Erroll Garner, Thelonious Monk and Marcus Roberts. Duke Ellington, who, like Fletcher Henderson and Count Basie, learned "Carolina Shout" from the player piano, called himself a "close disciple" of Johnson's. "James was more than a beginning," Ellington wrote. "He went right on up to the top." Johnson's influence appears not only in Ellington's playing but also in many of his compositions, from "Black Beauty" to "A Portrait of Bert Williams."</p>
        <p>Johnson and Waller, Count Basie said, "were not just piano players. They were composers."</p>
        <p>James Price Johnson, born in New Brunswick, N.J., in 1894, began to play ragtime and classical piano at an early age. By 1912, he was making a living as a pianist, playing at cabarets, movies and dance halls in San Juan Hill -- now the site of Lincoln Center, then a rough black annex of Hell's Kitchen.</p>
        <p>Soon Johnson dominated the competitive world of rent-party "ticklers," playing a music that blended ragtime and the blues into a new style called stride. Unlike ragtime, stride piano was improvised, and it swung. The striding left hand functioned as a rhythm section driving the music ahead with unexpected cross-accents while the right hand covered the upper registers with rhythmic arabesques in ever-changing patterns. The stride pianist was a one-man jazz orchestra.</p>
        <p>By the early 20's, Johnson had established his pre-eminence in stride piano, and his "Carolina Shout" became the test for all prospective ticklers. Compared to Scott Joplin's rags, Johnson's stride compositions inhabited a larger and livelier universe -- and they also demanded vastly greater virtuosity. Johnson's recordings and piano rolls demonstrate his powerful rhythmic drive, light touch and breathtaking inventiveness. A rare recording of his performance of 20 choruses of Gershwin's "Liza" displays his inexhaustible resources as an improviser.</p>
        <p>Johnson always viewed himself as more than a pianist. In 1920, he met Gershwin -- then on the verge of turning from the life of a song plugger to that of a songwriter -- when they were both making piano rolls for Aeolian, and Johnson later recalled that they shared their ambitions to write great music on American themes. Both had continued to study classical music while pursuing their work as entertainers.</p>
        <p>By 1924, Gershwin would write "Rhapsody in Blue" and "Lady, Be Good," but by 1923 Johnson had his first hit show, "Runnin' Wild," which included the songs "Old Fashioned Love" and "The Charleston." Gershwin paid Johnson the compliment of basing the first movement of his Piano Concerto in F (1925) on "The Charleston." Johnson, in turn, emulated Gershwin's example with his first symphonic composition, "Yamekraw: A Negro Rhapsody," which Waller performed at Carnegie Hall on April 27, 1928.</p>
        <p>"Yamekraw," orchestrated by William Grant Still, is not a jazz piece, but it combines jazz, stride, ragtime, blues, spirituals and gospel in a symphonic overview of black American musical genres. Rudi Blesh, the authority on ragtime, wrote that the music has a "feeling of breadth and a racial pungency that Gershwin missed, and its African rhythms move with a forthright nobility."</p>
        <p>Johnson's music has a charm and emotional warmth distinct from Gershwin's sophistication and glitter. For despite their intertwined lives they lived in parallel universes. Gershwin, like many stylish New Yorkers of the period, would visit Harlem at night. The next day he could turn uptown straw into Broadway gold. Johnson lived and worked in Harlem, and his music came out of the traditions of that community, including the music of the ring-shout, a religious dance that went all the way back to Africa.</p>
        <p>Gershwin was the toast of Broadway and, by 1924, was the favorite party pianist of the rich and famous. Johnson's shows played on Black Broadway, which was still saddled with the racial stereotypes of minstrelsy. Many of his songs are unperformable today because of their "blackface" lyrics -- although there are undoubtedly many more on the level of such Johnson standards as "If I Could Be With You One Hour Tonight" and "A Porter's Love Song to a Chambermaid."</p>
        <p>When Maurice Ravel visited New York in 1928, Gershwin took him uptown to hear the real jazz of the Harlem pianists. Later Ravel told American composers they could create a great music out of their popular traditions. Was he speaking of Gershwin or Johnson? Gerhswin received the support of Paul Whiteman, Walter Damrosch and Serge Koussevitzky, but Johnson was not taken up by any American conductors.</p>
        <p>Still, he persisted. Although he continued to play stride and compose songs and shows in the 30's and 40's, he devoted much of his creative effort to symphonic composition, including the "Harlem Symphony," the piano concerto "Jazz-o-Mine," the overture "Drums," an "American Suite," based on W. C. Handy's "St. Louis Blues," and an opera, "The Organizer," written in collaboration with Langston Hughes for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.</p>
        <p>The "Harlem Symphony" (1932) is probably Johnson's finest work. Its four movements, "Subway Ride," "April in Harlem," "Night Club" and "Baptist Mission," give an overview of the secular and sacred, the inside and outside life of the community, with strong melodies, colorful orchestration and, in the finale, a religious intensity. Despite the title, the music does not put on symphonic airs. It is like, say, Gershwin's "American in Paris," written with a similar show-business know-how but from a different point of view.</p>
        <p>Johnson's symphony provided a model for Duke Ellington's "Black, Brown and Beige" (1943) and "Tone Parallel to Harlem" (1950). But where Ellington's extended compositions are always jazz works, written for jazz performers, Johnson, like Gershwin, scored jazz materials for the classical orchestra. His style stands halfway between the dance hall and the concert hall. Some critics thought this approach both compromised the improvisational basis of jazz and lacked the formal complexity of symphonic music. Despite a Carnegie Hall tribute in 1945, his symphonic works dropped from sight. He died in 1955, after a series of paralyzing strokes.</p>
        <p>The concert by the Concordia chamber orchestra on Friday culminates six years of sleuthing and research by the conductor Marin Alsop and the pianist Leslie Stifelman. Little of Johnson's music is in print, and many of the orchestral materials were hidden away in family archives. Since 1986, Ms. Alsop and Ms. Stifelman crossed the country to track down unpublished scores and parts. Their research led them to Scott E. Brown, the author of a 1982 biography, "James P. Johnson: A Case of Mistaken Identity," whose knowledge of Johnson proved essential to assembling the musical materials.</p>
        <p>In his research, Dr. Brown, now a Baltimore physician, found that Johnson was constantly confused with other musicians or with other Johnsons. Even his date of birth differed widely from one source to another. Critics, moreover, could not decide whether his music was ragtime or jazz, and almost none took him seriously as a composer.</p>
        <p>Jazz critics, says Dr. Brown, pegged Johnson as a throwback to ragtime instead of seeing the way his music influenced the swing bands of Ellington, Henderson and Basie. The usually judicious Whitney Balliett, for example, placed Johnson "among the seminal jazz figures" Ellington, Basie and Jelly Roll Morton, but compared his classical ambitions to "a comedian lusting after the role of Hamlet."</p>
        <p>Yet Johnson, unlike his protege Waller, was not a comedian. For 25 years, despite ill health and little encouragement, he pursued symphonic composition. At the very moment of a revival of his music in the 1940's, strokes ended his performing and composing activity. His name dropped out of the jazz literature. Downbeat magazine even published a premature obituary. As it turned out, Johnson was not dead; he had simply disappeared.</p>
        <p>In looking for the music, Ms. Alsop and Ms. Stifelman unearthed much evidence of Johnson's persistent artistic devotion, tragic frustration -- and just plain bad luck. They found stacks of rejection letters from the Guggenheim Foundation, Fritz Reiner and even Paul Whiteman. Despite his successes on Broadway, he could not find employment in movies or radio. "When the sound films came in, they hired white people," Johnson once told an interviewer. His final musical, "Sugar Hill" (1948), never reached Broadway, despite a three-month run in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Johnson's music, Ms. Alsop finds, has a "personal quality that is hard to put into words, a straightforwardness that makes you feel as if you know the man and that corresponds to all the accounts of Johnson written by people who knew him well. You can really hear the intention of the music. It's political, and it wants the experiences it expresses to be taken seriously." A JOHNSON REVIVAL</p>
        <p>Jazz at Lincoln Center will offer two concerts of James P. Johnson's music this week:</p>
        <p>* On Thursday evening, the jazz pianist Marcus Roberts will perform a program of solo and small ensemble works at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>* On Friday evening, Marin Alsop will conduct the chamber orchestra Concordia in orchestral works, including the "Harlem Symphony," at Avery Fisher Hall. Mr. Roberts will join in "Yamekraw" and perform several stride compositions. He and the blues singer Carrie Smith will recreate some of Johnson's recordings with Bessie Smith, and the choreographer George Faison will revive the original steps for "The Charleston."
