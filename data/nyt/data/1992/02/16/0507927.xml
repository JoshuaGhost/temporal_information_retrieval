        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of my book, "Playing With Power in Movies, Television, and Video Games," Marie Winn challenges my assumption that video games have cognitive value for children (a conclusion supported by virtually every book on the subject) and erroneously claims that the empirical studies I cite "do not, unfortunately, include the major users of video games -- healthy 8- to 11-year-old boys." If she had looked at the endnotes, she would have seen that 25 of the empirical studies I mention do in fact deal with this group -- along with healthy girls. And so do the ethnographic studies I did with my own 8-year-old son and with children at a video arcade and a day-care center, which are described at length in two appendixes.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her review of my book, "Playing With Power in Movies, Television, and Video Games," Marie Winn challenges my assumption that video games have cognitive value for children (a conclusion supported by virtually every book on the subject) and erroneously claims that the empirical studies I cite "do not, unfortunately, include the major users of video games -- healthy 8- to 11-year-old boys." If she had looked at the endnotes, she would have seen that 25 of the empirical studies I mention do in fact deal with this group -- along with healthy girls. And so do the ethnographic studies I did with my own 8-year-old son and with children at a video arcade and a day-care center, which are described at length in two appendixes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winn is probably so obstinate in denying the cognitive value of video games because this position is consistent with the sweeping denun ciations of mass media featured in her own book "The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children and the Family."</p>
        <p>Although she fails to mention my book's central emphasis on how commercial supersystems like Nintendo and Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles commodify growth and how their popularity is related to the global economics of the 1980's and 90's, she gives great weight to one minor point: "Children heavily involved with video games may come to believe that athletes who win gold medals in the Olympics, or writers and scientists who win the Nobel Prize, are performing tasks that are no more important or difficult than winning at video games."</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly she chose that point not because it is representative of my argument, but rather as a lead-in to her own dubious speculation (which I am criticized for omitting) that "children accustomed to the quick gratifications of video games may not be willing to put up with the arduous efforts necessary to learn to play a musical instrument well, or to excel at tennis." Anyone who has ever played video games knows that it takes practice to excel at Nintendo.  MARSHA KINDER Los Angeles</p>
