        <p>Syd Straw</p>
        <p>Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Brooklyn Heights</p>
        <p>Syd Straw has a battery of different voices at her disposal, and she used them all on Friday night. In the upper range her voice is as high and breathless as a child's; when she slips into the middle range she's proud and defiant, lending lines like "Hey man, I'm making moves/And I am so much stronger than you" a touch of postfeminist empowerment. Down low she's vulnerable, able to communicate heartbreak in the stretch of the single syllable of love. Then there's her deadpan speaking voice. At one point in the concert, standing on the church's altar-stage surrounded by a band that included violin, cello, upright bass, guitar and drums, Ms. Straw strapped on a heavy blue electric guitar. The incongruity with her folkish chamber-rock as well as her outfit (in a well-tailored gray suit she looked like a mod Diane Keaton) was immediately apparent. "Think I'll turn it up to 10," she joked.</p>

        <p>Syd Straw</p>
        <p>Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Brooklyn Heights</p>
        <p>Syd Straw has a battery of different voices at her disposal, and she used them all on Friday night. In the upper range her voice is as high and breathless as a child's; when she slips into the middle range she's proud and defiant, lending lines like "Hey man, I'm making moves/And I am so much stronger than you" a touch of postfeminist empowerment. Down low she's vulnerable, able to communicate heartbreak in the stretch of the single syllable of love. Then there's her deadpan speaking voice. At one point in the concert, standing on the church's altar-stage surrounded by a band that included violin, cello, upright bass, guitar and drums, Ms. Straw strapped on a heavy blue electric guitar. The incongruity with her folkish chamber-rock as well as her outfit (in a well-tailored gray suit she looked like a mod Diane Keaton) was immediately apparent. "Think I'll turn it up to 10," she joked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Straw's program confirmed her status as a pre-eminent alternative diva. She mixed songs from her tenure with the downtown ensemble Golden Palominos with material from her 1989 solo album "Surprise" (Virgin Records), and a selection of carefully chosen songs like Neil Young's "Only Love Can Break Your Heart," Peter Holsapple's "She Was the One" and the Velvet Underground's "Venus in Furs." The artful string arrangements wrapped her in class and sophistication. The violinist Hahn Rowe, formerly of the band Hugo Largo, added lilting melodic lines to the medium-rocking numbers and a raw, almost industrial moan to the acutely lovelorn ballads. The cellist Jane Scarpantoni, too, could be demure or forceful on command.</p>
        <p>The disadvantage of Ms. Straw's multiple personae is that eventually an intelligible, cohesive personality slips through the cracks. She's both interpreter and author, straight man to her own comedian. There were moments, though, when all her incongruities intersected. As an encore she performed a version of Chet Baker's "Touch of Your Lips," accompanied only by the guest guitarist Marc Ribot. Given the strict interpretive limitations of a standard, Ms. Straw reined herself in and focused on each word and note, closely following the song's emotional outline. Here her voice was simply beautiful, clear and cool, rewriting the song in her slightly eccentric image and making it her own.</p>
