        <p>The haute couture sees itself as the fashion leader of the Western world, and in some ways it is the tops. Clothes painstakingly made by hand from the finest fabrics are indeed a joy to look at and to wear. Still, the styles presented last week as the spring and summer openings concluded were mostly tributes to the past.</p>
        <p>The only designer who looked to the future was Claude Montana, who parted from his post at the house of Lanvin immediately after his show last Tuesday. In his two years at Lanvin, he had won wide critical acclaim as the only convincing futurist in the couture. But he had failed to attract a significant number of clients.  What the Customers Want</p>
        <p>The truth is, there are not enough women willing and able to spend at least $10,000 for a dress to support a venture into the 21st century. Most of those women prefer clothes that express a traditional approach to femininity: defined waistlines, rounded hips, some cleavage and even fluffy petticoats.</p>
        <p>This is the mind set that Christian Dior successfully tapped with his New Look in 1947, which revived the couture industry after World War II. The hourglass curves of those clothes were a reincarnation of the Edwardian look of the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>What has significantly changed in the last 45 years is the attitude toward legs. After five years in the fashion spotlight, short skirts have won no more ardent fans than couture customers.</p>
        <p>"The women are generally older, their legs are in good shape and they do not want to cover them," observed Mr. Montana, who did not show any long skirts.</p>
        <p>Karl Lagerfeld, who did, said coolly, "Short skirts are for middle-aged women."</p>
        <p>Most designers, including Mr. Montana, agreed that long skirts were the coming trend, but few experimented with ways of making them palatable. They were more concerned with making clothes their clients would like than carrying the flag of the avant-garde.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld did not hesitate. He showed his famous Chanel suits with skirts ending anywhere from below the knee to below the calf and made them look good. But in what many perceived as nose-thumbing at the whole fashion world, he also tore fabrics into two-inch-wide strips or triangles, didn't bother to hem the edges and made them into skirts and dresses. While some critics hailed his deconstruction of fashion, customers flinched.</p>
        <p>"Who wants to look like a rag picker at those prices?" Josie Natori, a designer, asked. Some labeled it the bag-lady look.</p>
        <p>Christian Lacroix, who helped catapult short skirts into their strong position, said he now prefers longer styles, and he showed many of them. But he also fudged the issue. A good deal of his collection was devoted to wide-leg pants, often pleated, which often resembled skirts. They usually covered the calf.</p>
        <p>Gerard Pipart also lowered the hemlines at Nina Ricci, but he did it in the spirit of the 1930's. Though his approach seemed to work, it didn't extend the range of fashion.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Lagerfeld and Mr. Lacroix contributed to the excitement of the season, not simply because of skirt lengths, but also because they were willing to experiment. It is taken for granted that the couture can produce pretty dresses. Both Yves Saint Laurent and Hubert de Givenchy showed lovely, wearable collections. Neither pushed the clock of fashion forward. Will the Haute Be Brought Low?</p>
        <p>During the showings here, the question of the relevance of the couture industry arose again, as it had in the late 1960's and through most of the 70's. That was when the rival ready-to-wear industry was feeling its oats in Paris. It was also a time when grandeur was played down; opulence was out.</p>
        <p>The couture survived. With the arrival in the 1980's of Karl Largerfeld at Chanel and Christian Lacroix, first at Patou and then as the head of his own house, it began generating its own excitement. The industry's function, its leaders insisted, was not merely to attract publicity to its perfume and ready-to-wear lines, but to serve as a laboratory of fashion for the world. It is that contention that is being questioned.</p>
        <p>There is movement toward changing the rules for membership in the Chambre Syndicale, the couture's governing body, to make entrance easier for younger, presumably more creative designers. Attending to the Rules</p>
        <p>Already some rules are being bent. Members are supposed to stage regular fashion shows with live models for potential clients through most of the season. Today, videos made at the press shows are shown instead.</p>
        <p>The 21 current members are required to show at least 65 styles each season. The larger houses show almost 100 styles. Would reducing the number of styles increase the quality of design? Does a blouse count as a separate piece, or is it part of the suit it accompanies?</p>
        <p>A commission of eight couture representatives is working on such sticky problems. It will offer its recommendations this month. They are expected to be mainly cosmetic and not to affect seriously the standing of the couture industry. The questions being considered deal with the cost of developing a couture collection. It is impossible to legislate creativity.</p>
