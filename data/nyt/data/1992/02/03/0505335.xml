        <p>Making a rare exception to its economic blockade of the Communist Government of President Fidel Castro, the Bush Administration has granted permission to A.T.&amp;T. to expand telephone service between Cuba and the United States.</p>
        <p>But Administration officials say that far from recasting their policy of isolating the Communist Government, they instead intend the move to help stir popular unrest by increasing exposure between Cubans and their more affluent relatives in the United States.</p>
        <p>Despite Washington's motivation, Havana would apparently like to believe that telephone diplomacy, like the Ping-Pong diplomacy that improved American relations with China, could loosen the embargo.</p>
        <p>"It could be a good sign," said Ariel Ricardo, spokesman of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, "but you always have doubts about what is the intention."</p>
        <p>The Administration's decision in late December to allow the company to pay Havana $620,000 in fees for operation of a cable line to Cuba reflects a new, more flexible approach to the island nation at a time when the Castro Government faces a serious threat from the collapse of Soviet Communism and the loss of Moscow's crucial aid.</p>
        <p>Even as it has tightened regulations on Cubans who wish to immigrate, the Administration initiated new immigration negotiations with Havana in December. And in a move that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, the Administration shared intelligence information with Havana to thwart a reported terrorist plot to plant a bomb at the recent Pan American Games.</p>
        <p>The Administration's willingness to promote A.T.&amp;T.'s business in Cuba comes at a time when there has been a shift in the thinking of some Cuban-Americans who are influential in the Republican Party. Once opposed to any accommodations with Havana, they and the Administration have come to believe that increased communications can spur popular opposition to the Castro Government.</p>
        <p>"We believe the more information that flows into Cuba the better," said a senior State Department official.</p>
        <p>A break with past practice was signified by the Treasury Department's long-delayed approval of A.T.&amp;.T.'s three-year-old request for permission to pay the Castro Government annual maintenance and capital improvement fees for a telephone cable. While a handful of American companies have received licenses to deal with the Cuban Government in the last several years, all were involved in educational, artistic or charitable endeavors, not commercial transactions.</p>
        <p>About 60 million attempts to place telephone calls are made annually between the countries, but only about 500,000 get through the antiquated short-wave radio system. Many people spend hours dialing in vain. With the copper underwater cable connecting West Palm Beach, Fla., and Cojimar, Cuba, an estimated 250,000 more calls should be completed annually.</p>
        <p>Officials predict the cable could be operational by the spring. Treasury Department approval is required for the deal on the payment of tolls, by which Cuba would eventually earn between $1 million and $2 million a year.</p>
        <p>The Cuban Government is not expected to net money from the transaction, and may even lose some currency, because it receives what callers consider exorbitant fees for some calls between the United States that are now patched through from Canada.</p>
