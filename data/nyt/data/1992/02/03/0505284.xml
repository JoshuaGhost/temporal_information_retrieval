        <p>When JAMES TONEY, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, fights DAVE TIBERI Saturday in Atlantic City, you won't find JACKIE KELLEN in the audience. Rather she will be in the champion's corner, perhaps whispering advice between rounds.</p>
        <p>Kellen belongs there because she is Toney's manager.</p>
        <p>She has been since discovering him four years ago, when he was an unknown 19-year-old fighter from Ann Arbor, Mich., working out in a gym in nearby Lavonia.</p>
        <p>Toney needed a manager. His previous one, a drug dealer, had been shot to death outside a Detroit bar.</p>
        <p>Kellen makes little of the notion that she may be the only female fight manager in the world. "The only women you saw in boxing before used to hold up the cards between rounds," she said recently. "I think I can do a lot for this sport. I certainly can improve its image which, I don't need to tell you, is terrible."</p>
        <p>Kellen, the mother of two grown sons and the wife of a building contractor, has a background in journalism and was first attracted to boxing 14 years ago when she was writing an article on TOMMY HEARNS. Then came public relations work for Hearns and the Kronk Gym in Detroit, her home city.</p>
        <p>"I found my niche," she said. "Apparently it was in the cards I was to become a manager of fighters. Why not? I have good management qualities, scheduling, planning. I like to get things done."</p>
        <p>Apparently she is doing all right. Toney's gross income from fighting was $20,000 in 1990 and $750,000 last year, when he won the I.B.F. title from MICHAEL NUNN with a knockout on May 10.</p>
        <p>She forecasts that Toney's income will go even higher this year, beginning with the $100,000 ABC will pay for his appearance in Saturday's 12-round bout.</p>
        <p>As for being in the fighter's corner, that is by preference. "It's where the excitement is," she said.</p>
