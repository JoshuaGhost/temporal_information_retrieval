        <p>President Bush's proposal to help 90 million Americans buy health insurance with new tax credits and tax deductions would be financed mainly by curbing the growth of Government health programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Administration officials and members of Congress say.</p>
        <p>In a speech on Thursday in Cleveland, Mr. Bush intends to introduce the proposal, which is intended to help people who have no insurance and those who have difficulty paying for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also plans to travel to San Diego on Friday to visit an immunization clinic and speak to a Rotary Club about his proposals. The trip is meant to help Mr. Bush answer Democratic charges that he has ignored health and other domestic issues.</p>
        <p>A confidential set of questions and answers, prepared by officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget in advance of Mr. Bush's announcement, says, "The President's plan will not hurt beneficiaries in any way." The document notes that Medicaid and Medicare would continue growing, but at a slower rate. Less for Hospitals</p>
        <p>Administration officials said in interviews that the President's plan would cut back payments to many hospitals and doctors that treat elderly people under Medicare and poor people under Medicaid. It would, for example, reduce special allowances now paid to teaching hospitals and hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income patients.</p>
        <p>A Federal budget official working on the President's plan said it would reduce "selected sources of excessive reimbursement to both doctors and hospitals."</p>
        <p>Democrats have their own proposals for overhauling the nation's health care system. With Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, Congress is unlikely to approve Mr. Bush's proposal. But the White House officials said the President would be able to say that he had seriously addressed the nation's health care problems as he campaigned for re-election. Medicare Premiums May Drop</p>
        <p>A White House document describing Mr. Bush's proposal suggested that it might eventually lead to a reduction in premiums under Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 34 million elderly and disabled people.</p>
        <p>In the document, the White House asks, "Is the President's plan going to accomplish its cost savings by severely reducing Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals -- to the point that providers won't want to treat Medicare patients?"</p>
        <p>After saying that would not happen, the document adds, "Bringing the costs of Medicare under control may reduce the premium contributions for seniors." The monthly Medicare premium for insurance covering doctors' services has not been reduced since the program was created. It started at $3 in 1966 and is now $31.80.</p>
        <p>Administration officials contended that hospitals could absorb cutbacks in their Medicare payments because, under Mr. Bush's plan, more people would have private health insurance and would be able to pay their bills, thus reducing the hospitals' burdens of bad debt and charity care.</p>
        <p>"Over 90 million Americans would receive new assistance for health care" under the plan, the White House document says.  Alarm at Hospitals</p>
        <p>But hospital executives, especially those at urban teaching hospitals, expressed alarm at the prospect of slower growth in Medicare payments, at a time when their revenues are often inadequate to cover the costs of treating patients.</p>
        <p>Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said: "There is no assurance there would be a match between the institutions that are cut and the institutions that benefit under the proposals being discussed by officials in Washington. For teaching hospitals in New York City, which operate at nearly full capacity but barely break even, I fear there would be a reduction in Medicare payments without an equivalent offsetting gain."</p>
        <p>Medicare and Medicaid account for two-thirds of the revenue that Montefiore gets for treating patients admitted to the hospital: $300 million of the $450 million expected for this year.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said that under current law, "more than two-thirds of the nation's hospitals are expected to lose money in their treatment of Medicare patients, and the situation is even worse under Medicaid."</p>
        <p>More than 35 million people have no health insurance. Another 34 million people are covered by Medicare, and nearly 30 million are covered by Medicaid. About 177 million people, including many enrolled in Medicare, have some type of private health insurance.</p>
        <p>Health is emerging as a pivotal issue in this year's election. Mr. Bush is already denouncing Democratic proposals that would require employers to provide health insurance or would establish a system of national health insurance run by the Federal Government and the states.</p>
        <p>Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 investor-owned hospitals, said he did not expect swift action on Mr. Bush's proposal. "It hasn't got a chance in a million," he said. "Nobody expects Bush's plan to pass, not even Bush."</p>
        <p>Some Democrats in Congress want to pass a comprehensive health care bill this year, believing they will reap political benefits if Mr. Bush vetoes it. Mr. Bromberg said, "We will have a stalemate until after the elections because the two parties are moving in totally different philosophical directions on this issue."</p>
        <p>The White House document says Mr. Bush's plan would reduce "an unsustainable high rate of growth" in payments to doctors and hospitals, but would not cut the total amount spent on Medicare, $118 billion last year.</p>
        <p>The Administration's efforts to slow the growth in Medicare and Medicaid follow logically from Mr. Bush's premises and promises. Administration officials have publicly said that his plan will expand access to health care, will be comprehensive and will pay for itself, but will not raise taxes.</p>
        <p>At a news conference last week, Kevin E. Moley, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the President's plan was intended to provide "universal access to health care," and he said "there will be no tax increase." But last week Mr. Bush proposed a sharp increase in Medicare premiums for couples with incomes of more than $125,000 and individuals with incomes over $100,000.</p>
        <p>Appearing today on the ABC News program "This Week," Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said annual spending on health care averages "$2,700 per capita for every man, woman and child" in the United States. "We have enough dollars in the health care system," he said. "We're not spending them in the wisest way. The President's plan will redirect those dollars to spend them more effectively." Budget Changes to Come</p>
        <p>In his 1993 budget request last week, President Bush proposed few legislative changes in Medicare and Medicaid. But a Federal health official said people should "stay tuned" because Mr. Bush's comprehensive health care plan envisions huge savings in the two programs. The proposed savings were omitted from the budget because the Administration was still working on details of its health plan last week.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they had not determined the cost of Mr. Bush's plan; their estimates range from $55 billion to $100 billion over five years. Members of Congress who have been briefed on the plan by Administration officials estimate that 40 percent of the money would come from Medicare and 60 percent from Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Asked about the financing of Mr. Bush's proposal, a Republican member of Congress said, "I can't make the numbers add up, and I know how the Administration plans to pay for it."</p>
        <p>Sara Rosenbaum, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Health Policy Research, said, "The Administration would finance health care for poor people who have no health insurance by cutting health care for poor people who have insurance through Medicaid."  Tax Credits for the Poor</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would offer tax credits to poor people so they could buy health insurance. The credit would be $3,750 a year for a family and $1,250 for an individual. The Administration says this would be enough for people to buy "high-quality basic health insurance." Unlike most credits, this one would be available to people so poor they pay no income taxes.</p>
        <p>To higher-income people who do not qualify for the tax credit, Mr. Bush would offer tax deductions. The White House document says the President's plan "will provide individuals and families with up to $3,750 in deductions for the cost of purchasing health coverage." The deductions are meant to help people buy insurance, not to pay the full cost.</p>
        <p>The tax credit and deduction amounts would be "set at a uniform level across the nation." There would be no adjustment for cities with high medical costs like New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The White House document describing the President's proposal says Mr. Bush "would require employers to provide information about health insurance plans and arrange enrollment in group coverage" for their workers. But Mr. Bush's plan does not require employers to contribute to the cost of such health insurance, as many Democrats propose.  Coverage for Almost Everyone</p>
        <p>While "there is no mandatory coverage" under Mr. Bush's plan, "it is expected that over 98 percent of Americans would be covered," the document says.</p>
        <p>"Some Americans -- we expect under two million low-risk middle-income people -- may choose not to buy health insurance, regardless of improved affordability, and spend their money elsewhere while gambling on their current good health," it says.</p>
        <p>In hopes of slowing the growth of Medicaid, Mr. Bush is expected to propose flat per capita grants to the states for each Medicaid recipient. White House officials say such grants would provide a new incentive for states to rein in Medicaid costs by enrolling poor people in health maintenance organizations and other prepaid health plans, which provide a wide range of medical services in return for a fixed monthly fee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan would also limit damages in medical malpractice cases and encourage states to set up alternative methods of resolving such disputes to reduce the number of cases in court. He would change Federal law to make it easier for small companies to band together and buy health insurance for workers. He also wants to prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people who have medical problems when they apply for coverage.</p>
