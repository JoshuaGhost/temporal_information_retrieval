        <p>The United States Customs Service has begun to enforce an embargo on imports of yellowfin tuna from 20 countries where processors use fish caught by methods that harm dolphins, the agency has announced.</p>
        <p>The action, taken Friday at the direction of the Justice Department and the National Marine Fisheries Service, complies with a Federal court order. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California had ordered the Government to take actions to halt the importation of tuna that had been harvested by a method that did not protect dolphins.</p>

        <p>The United States Customs Service has begun to enforce an embargo on imports of yellowfin tuna from 20 countries where processors use fish caught by methods that harm dolphins, the agency has announced.</p>
        <p>The action, taken Friday at the direction of the Justice Department and the National Marine Fisheries Service, complies with a Federal court order. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California had ordered the Government to take actions to halt the importation of tuna that had been harvested by a method that did not protect dolphins.</p>
        <p>Yellowfin tuna is harvested by fishermen from Mexico and Venezuela, using large encircling nets that also kill hundreds of dolphins. While only those two countries harvest the tuna in this manner, the tuna is often shipped to intermediary countries for processing and then exported to the United States.</p>
        <p>The Customs Service said the embargo covered yellowfin tuna from Britain, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Panama, Singapore, the Marshall Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.</p>
