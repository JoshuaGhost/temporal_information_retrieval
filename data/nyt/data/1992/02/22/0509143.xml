        <p>A Woman's Own Credit For a married woman to build and maintain a credit history on charge accounts and credit cards, it is important for her to have credit in her own name or in joint accounts. But confusion often arises when marital status changes. Here is some advice on the effect that these life changes can have on your credit status.</p>
        <p>Marriage When you marry, you don't have to do anything to maintain the accounts you had when you were single. Or you can establish a credit history via your husband by opening joint accounts, which means that both parties will be responsible for all debts and each will benefit from good payment records (or suffer from poor ones). If you are an authorized user of your husband's accounts, you can use them, but are not part of their credit history. If you are uncertain of your credit status, check to see whether you are a joint-account holder or just an authorized user of your spouse's accounts. The shift to joint account will be made on the account holder's request. Divorce If you are legal separated or divorced, write to all creditors to close all joint or authorized-user accounts. This will avoid future charges by your husband for which you may be liable. To change the accounts to individual ones, you normally have to reapply for credit in your own name. Widowhood A store or credit card company cannot automatically close a joint account when one of the parties dies. But you may have to reapply or update an application to show that you continue to qualify on your own. An authorized-user account is more likely to be closed in the event that the account holder dies. (Source: Consumer Credit Education Foundation)</p>
