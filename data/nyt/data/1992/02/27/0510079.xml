        <p>Nominees on Cassette</p>
        <p>As happens every year, the Oscar nominations announced last week find top films with their video plans spread across the calendar. Of 14 movies named in 6 major categories (picture, director, actor, actress, supporting actor and actress), only 3 are out on tape.</p>
        <p>"Thelma and Louise" is currently No. 1 on most best-renter lists. Two more of the 14, "The Silence of the Lambs" and "City Slickers," have also been best renters for months. What is the advantage of being nominated? "It attracts people who haven't seen the film yet," said George Feltenstein of MGM/UA, which released "Thelma and Louise."</p>
        <p>In March, 4 more of the 14 films will be available, beginning next week with "Barton Fink." On March 12 will come "Boyz N the Hood," which has begun a second theater run virtually on top of its video release. Later in the month "The Fisher King" and "Rambling Rose" will be released.</p>
        <p>Big films from the holidays and later will be spaced through the summer and fall, with actual dates for the most part unannounced and as carefully plotted with an eye to the competition as are theater release dates. First out, on May 28, will be "For the Boys." In June will come "Cape Fear" and after that "Fried Green Tomatoes."</p>
        <p>"The Prince of Tides" is scheduled for sometime in the summer, as is "Bugsy," though this release could be delayed by an extended run in theaters. "Beauty and the Beast" is reportedly planned for November.</p>
        <p>That leaves "J. F. K.," with eight nominations all told. "No comment at all," said a Warner spokesman. Laser Beginnings</p>
        <p>The book lists videos -- about 5,000 movies, documentaries, animated features and other titles -- but Douglas Pratt's "Laser Video Disk Companion," just published in an updated edition by New York Zoetrope, is really a course of instruction for those interested in getting started with disk or adding to a disk collection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pratt, who is the editor of the "Laser Disk Newsletter" in East Rockaway, L.I., writes with a warm and accessible style. Before assessing the titles, he tells how disks are made and what differentiates films on disk from those on tape. The book also describes the technical aspects of visual and audio and what goes into making a good disk.</p>
        <p>In his 4,000 reviews, Mr. Pratt plays standard critic but also gives painstaking attention to production values and how successfully they have been duplicated in the manufacture of the disk. If that sounds daunting, be assured that in Mr. Pratt's hands it becomes fascinating. "The Laser Disk Companion" is $24.95 and is available where disks are found. Or call (800) 242-7546; in New York City, (212) 420-0590. NEW VIDEO RELEASES</p>
        <p>Dogfight  1991. Warner. $92.99. Laser disk, $29.98.  1 hour 34 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>The year is 1963 and to entertain themselves on their last night in the United States before shipping out to Vietnam, Birdlace (River Phoenix) and some fellow marines have a competition to pick up the ugliest girl. Birdlace, however, gets more than he bargained for when his entrant in the competition (Lili Taylor) turns out to be intelligent and appealing. But after that the idea goes nowhere. While the director Nancy Savoca was noted for her touch with ordinary people like these in her first movie, "True Love" (1989), here it is as if she doesn't know what they are really like. "The film wants to be honest (and in its cruelties, it is), but the operative sensibility is that of a sitcom world" (Vincent Canby).  L. B. J.  1991. PBS Home Video. Two tapes,</p>
        <p>"He was just interesting as hell," says one critic of the former President in David Grubin's documentary, which was shown on PBS last fall. Four episodes pick up Johnson in early career and end with the ravaged figure who, brought down by the Vietnam War, declined to run for re-election in 1968. Using recollections of L. B. J.'s intimates and detractors, the tapes uncover some of the many layers of a man who wished he could deal with everything as if he were on Capitol Hill. "If I could just sit in a room with Ho Chi Minh, I think we could cut a deal," he told an associate. Through apt material and a lean style, Mr. Grubin "manages quickly, deftly, pungently to get at the political style of a formidable practitioner" (Walter Goodman).  Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare  1991. New Line. $94.95. 1:36. CC. R.</p>
        <p>The sixth and supposedly final chapter of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series finds the talon-fingered Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) with such a depleted pool of teen-agers to victimize in Springwood, U.S.A., that he has to zero in on a home for wayward children. There he encounters his own long-lost offspring, who proves his father's undoing. Until then, though, all "join Freddy in fantasyland sooner or later, with results that can be ghoulishly ingenious" (Janet Maslin).  Coup de Torchon  1982. First Run Features. $59.95. 2:08. French with English subtitles. No rating.</p>
        <p>The scorned and inept police chief (Philippe Noiret) in a small French West African village turns the tables on his detractors by shooting all the riffraff, including the husband of his mistress (Isabelle Huppert). With characteristic flair and polish, Bertrand Tavernier's film painstakingly documents the racial tension and dissolution among the colonials, but there is little payoff in a work that "seems strangely lacking in momentum and direction" (Maslin).  FROM ELSEWHERE</p>
        <p>Screen adaptations, from "The Prince of Tides" to "Fried Green Tomatoes," figure prominently in this year's Oscar nominations. Here are some of the best-known adaptations available on tape.</p>
