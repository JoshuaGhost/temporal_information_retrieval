        <p>They had become virtual American folk heroes, the waitress and the truck driver: two middle-class kids raising money through public appearances and the sale of booster pins so they could live out their dreams as Olympic athletes. With a stretch, you could almost imagine them climbing that victory podium and bowing their heads to be draped with the gold medals.</p>
        <p>In a dream, anyway.</p>
        <p>For all their endearing qualities, this was not the night Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval had envisioned for their Olympic debut. As the figure-skating competition of the 1992 Winter Games opened here tonight with the original program for pairs, they skated to music from the musical "Can-Can," selected just to please the French crowd, but suffered a major error early and ranked seventh after the round.</p>
        <p>As the United States champions, they not only trailed the favorites, two pairs from the United Team of former Soviet athletes -- Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev, the current world champions, and Yelena Bechke and Denis Petrov -- they were behind another American couple, Natasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand, who managed sixth.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. Urbanski, the 31-year-old waitress and former bartender from Wilmington, Del., and Marval, the 27-year-old owner of a trucking company in New Egypt, N.J., and occasional driver, are having the times of their lives just experiencing the Olympics. 'This Is It'</p>
        <p>"When we skated out, I turned to Calla and said: 'This is it. This is the Olympics,' " Marval said, still buzzing.</p>
        <p>Urbanski, the oldest skater in the Games, said: "That made me feel good. We both had a rough day and a rough night, so we wanted to go out there and enjoy it and not let the moment pass us by."</p>
        <p>Their difficulties arose from untimely colds. More than a few of the United States skaters were suffering at the team's quarters in Brides-les-Bains, a village 45 minutes away from here by bus. Urbanski and Marval had requested a certain antihistamine from the American medical personnel on Saturday night, only to learn the supply was depleted. By today, the medication had arrived, but a little too late to help.</p>
        <p>Despite their enthusiasm, they were somewhat flat in their presentation, Marval more than Urbanski, and it was he that brought them most of the trouble. In executing side-by-side double-axel jumps, one of the eight required elements in the original program, he took off awkwardly, considered doing only a single axel, went ahead with the double anyway, then slid into the restraining boards upon landing.</p>
        <p>"She did it at the nationals, so I guess it was my turn here," Marval said, recalling Urbanski's fall last month at the national championships in Orlando, Fla. They stood third after the original but overtook Kuchiki and Sand as well as Jenni Meno and Scott Wendland to win their first national title. Meno and Wendland, runners-up in Orlando, skated well tonight but failed to convince the judges, who ranked them 12th. Room For Improvement</p>
        <p>"It's hard to get 5.6's and 5.7's, then drop to 4.9's and 5.0's," said Urbanski, reflecting the difference between here and Orlando. "But I know we can do better."</p>
        <p>Marval said: "I'm sure we can pull up one or two spots. Our goal was top five, and I think that's realistic."</p>
        <p>By holding the leading positions, the United Team pairs provided that much more evidence that not all phases of former Soviet society are eroding under the weight of economic deprivations. Soviet pairs won the previous seven Olympic titles, and it would be virtually impossible to imagine one of the United Team leaders not making it eight titles Tuesday night after the free-skate phase of competition, which counts for two-thirds of the overall score.</p>
        <p>Mishkutienok and Dmitriev was were especially appealing, prancing about to music from "Don Quixote" and erring only when they lost synchronization of side-by-side spins. Their double axels were splendid, which Mishkutienok appreciated more than anyone but maybe their coach, Tamara Moskvina.</p>
        <p>"This was the first I have done this season," she said. She had botched them at the Lalique Trophy competition here last November and at the European championships last month in Lausanne, Switzerland, events they won, anyway, which is the best indication their streak is likely to continue.</p>
        <p>Even if it appears the waitress and the truck driver are having more fun.  ALBERTVILLE</p>
