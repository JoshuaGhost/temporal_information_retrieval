        <p>Twelve republics of the former Soviet Union are likely to be able to field their own Olympic teams in Games beginning after Jan. 1, 1993, the president of the International Olympic Committee said today.</p>
        <p>For the republics to qualify, the I.O.C. must first officially recognize the national Olympic committees of the republics, said the I.O.C. leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch. This could happen as soon as early March, when Olympic officials are scheduled to meet representatives of the national Olympic committees in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
        <p>In addition, the republics must agree to participate in international competitions this year as a "Unified Team," as five former republics of the Soviet Union are doing at the Albertville Winter Games that begin Saturday, Samaranch said.</p>
        <p>The plan offers something to everyone. Olympic Ranks Swelling</p>
        <p>For the republics, it allows them more time to organize their committees and teams before they have to face the international spotlight alone. For the I.O.C., there is more time to work out how to handle the swelling number of potential Olympic participants; besides the 12 republics of the former Soviet Union, the committee has added Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Slovenia and Croatia, which have broken from Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Samaranch noted that the ranks of national Olympic committees could approach 200 by the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996. He reiterated that he wanted to keep the number of athletes below 10,500 in the Summer Games. As a result, he said, it could be necessary to restrict the number of participants in track and field and swimming, meaning some smaller countries will have to drop out of competition.</p>
        <p>But making it more difficult to play in the Olympics is not so bad, Samaranch suggested. Improved competition could reduce the occasions where athletes straggle in "five laps after the last finisher." Three Big Topics</p>
        <p>In the wide-ranging news conference, Samaranch addressed most of the hottest topics facing the committee:</p>
        <p>*South Africa will participate fully in the Barcelona Summer Games.</p>
        <p>*No blood testing of athletes to detect banned substances will occur in Albertville.</p>
        <p>*I.O.C. members are "worrying" about terrorist attacks in Spain but Samaranch has "every confidence" in the ability of the Spanish Government to take adequate security measures.</p>
        <p>Samaranch also said the I.O.C. would investigate an exhibit in a museum in Banyoles outside of Barcelona, the site of the summer rowing competition. The exhibit includes the stuffed body of an African tribesman and has proven offensive to many Africans and black Americans. Inquiry on Spying</p>
        <p>ALBERTVILLE, France, Feb. 7 (Reuters) -- German bobsledder Harald Czudaj has admitted he spied for the East German secret police and will be quizzed by German Olympic officials at the Winter Games, the delegation leader, Willi Daume, said today.</p>
        <p>Czudaj, one of the favorites to win the gold medal in the four-man bobsled, admitted in a confidential letter that he had reported on teammates to the Stasi secret police, Daume told a news conference. But Daume said no disciplinary action would be taken against Czudaj, who is still training in Germany, until he was given the chance to explain himself. He said this might be done by telephone or after Czudaj arrived in France for the Games, probably Feb. 15.</p>
