        <p>METRO DIGEST  UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNCERTAINTY</p>
        <p>The New York region faces the prospect of at least 40,000 employees losing their jobs during the next few years. This comes on the heels of the more than 500,000 jobs lost in the region since employment peaked in February 1989. But there is a new and, in many ways, more disruptive element to the latest round of layoff announcements. As companies reveal that thousands of people will be laid off but provide scant details as to when, where or who will be affected, they are creating heightened uncertainty, and causing even those whose jobs are not directly threatened to cut their spending.

This comes on the heels of the more than 500,000 jobs lost in the region since employment peaked in February 1989. But there is a new and, in many ways, more disruptive element to the latest round of layoff announcements. As companies reveal that thousands of people will be laid off but provide scant details as to when, where or who will be affected, they are creating heightened uncertainty, and causing even those whose jobs are not directly threatened to cut their spending. A1. NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN PROJECT MOVES AHEAD</p>
        <p>The city signed a 20-year-lease to move the Brooklyn District Attorney's office into a long-stalled commercial complex in downtown Brooklyn, providing the linchpin that could lead the way to construction of the first hotel in the borough in half a century. B4. HOUSING PROJECT PROTEST</p>
        <p>On her second day as chairwoman of the Housing Authority, Sally Hernandez-Pinero came under fire when she refused to meet with about 100 people who went to her office to demand faster repairs and maintenance and better security in public housing projects. B3. WHO'LL MARCH IN THE IRISH PARADE?</p>
        <p>Pressure increased on the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day Parade to allow a gay and lesbian group to march in it, even as warring factions of the organization, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, came to an agreement on who would be the parade's official sponsor. B3. Doctor accused of botched abortion loses license. B2. Manhattan trumpeter wins first high-school Grammy. B3. REGION  MIGRANTS OF DRUG WORLD</p>
        <p>Bands of young New York City drug dealers, skilled in the use of guns and terrorist tactics to take over neighborhoods, are being recruited to hustle the streets of Buffalo and surrounding cities and towns, according to local and Federal law-enforcement officials. Lured by higher-level dealers' promises of a safer and more lucrative trade, these teen-agers have become the migrant workers of the drug world. A1. JEWS FOR JESUS IS REBUFFED</p>
        <p>New York State's highest court ruled that a Jewish group did not violate state anti-discrimination statutes by urging that restaurant owners and ministers refuse to rent space to Jews for Jesus Inc., a missionary organization that recognizes Christ as the Messiah. B5. FUTURE OF A RACEWAY</p>
        <p>If there's one thing Long Island doesn't need, it's another shopping center and movie-theater complex, neighbors of Roosevelt Raceway said at a public hearing on the future of the raceway, the largest piece of undeveloped commercial property in Nassau County. B5. Former Rochester police chief convicted. B5. Cuomo is rebuffed on bias-crime bill. B5. New education chief for Connecticut. B5. About New York B3  Neediest Cases B2</p>
