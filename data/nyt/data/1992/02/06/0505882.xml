        <p>With the prospect of another bitter fight over Connecticut's budget before them, many lawmakers here seemed glum and guarded today as they waited for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. to deliver his State of the State address.</p>
        <p>Even the opening prayer, delivered by a Senate chaplain, was bleak. "This day is a little less bright because of the clouds of uncertainty that hang over both chambers," said the chaplain, the Rev. Joseph A. Devine, just before the Governor stepped to the podium.</p>

        <p>With the prospect of another bitter fight over Connecticut's budget before them, many lawmakers here seemed glum and guarded today as they waited for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. to deliver his State of the State address.</p>
        <p>Even the opening prayer, delivered by a Senate chaplain, was bleak. "This day is a little less bright because of the clouds of uncertainty that hang over both chambers," said the chaplain, the Rev. Joseph A. Devine, just before the Governor stepped to the podium.</p>
        <p>And when the speech was over, legislators gave it mixed reviews.  'Made the Right Move'</p>
        <p>Many said it was a relief that the Governor had not proposed any new taxes but that they did not necessarily support the cuts he specified, such as shrinking benefits for many state workers and retirees and slashing state aid to nursing homes, cities and towns. All General Assembly members face re-election this year.</p>
        <p>"The Governor has made the right move in saying he's going to live within the fiscal resources of the State of Connecticut," said Senator James H. Maloney, a Danbury Democrat who opposed the income tax enacted last year to help bridge the budget deficit. "I only wish he had made that decision last year."</p>
        <p>Mr. Maloney said he thought the budget's priorities needed to be realigned. "Where it needs work," he said, "is that the cuts are in the wrong places -- to services, cities and towns. As an alternative, he has to look at administrative cuts and cuts in overhead costs." Angry Interest Groups</p>
        <p>Some legislators referred to the $8.07 billion budget plan as "facing reality," yet they were bracing for yowls of opposition from those who would be affected by the proposed $1.1 billion in spending cuts.</p>
        <p>"There's no interest group in the State of Connecticut that is not going to be calling us up," said Senator Kenneth L. Przybysz, a vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. "There isn't anything that people won't scream about. I'm just thinking of all the work that has to be done."</p>
        <p>Most legislators seemed eager to avoid the kind of protracted battle between the legislative and executive branches that dragged on through most of last summer before a budget was adopted that included more than $1 billion in cuts and a 4.5 percent tax on personal income, the state's first.</p>
        <p>"This is a very realistic appraisal of the state's circumstances," said Representative Gary Le Beau, a Democrat from East Hartford.</p>
        <p>"Many people feel that if any good has come out of this recession," said the Senate majority leader, Cornelius O'Leary, "it is the creation of fertile ground for the elimination of many of the sacred cows that have been grazing on the state budget. I wish some of these cuts had been made last year, and I don't agree with all of his priorities. But I urge this budget's passage, and then let's work to modify it." Woes of Poor Cities</p>
        <p>Even among legislators from the state's poorest cities, where proposed cuts in welfare could have the greatest impact, the mood seemed more resigned than angry. "I expected it to happen, given the situation we find ourselves in," said Representative William Dyson, an eight-term Democrat from New Haven. "It's reality being presented to us in such a way that we can't deny it."</p>
        <p>Lobbyists were out in force, many of them criticizing the cuts that Mr. Weicker proposed.</p>
        <p>"He said his No. 1 priority is creation of jobs," said Lloyd Novick, who lobbies on behalf of nonprofit nursing homes. "But at the same time, he orders a $100 million cut that will eliminate 3,000 jobs in nursing homes. Our membership sees this as an abandonment of the frail elderly."</p>
        <p>As he spoke, a man wearing an anti-income tax sandwich board stepped silently along the corridor outside the House chamber, where knots of people stood discussing the Governor's speech.</p>
