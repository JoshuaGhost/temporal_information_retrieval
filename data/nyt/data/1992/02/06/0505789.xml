        <p>It must surely seem to be an oversight that National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations, allowing colleges to pay for a student athletes's room, board, books, tuition and fees, make no provision for bail.</p>
        <p>But rules are rules, so when University of Nevada-Las Vegas officials learned that his academic adviser had put up $200 bail for the Runnin' Rebels' leading scorer, J. R. RIDER, after his arrest last month, Rider was declared ineligible, threatening the team's 13-game winning streak as it prepared for tonight's game against California-Santa Barbara.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, two days after the officials acted, Rider was reinstated by the N.C.A.A. at the university's request after reimbursing the adviser. That condition had been laid down by college officials.</p>
        <p>Rider still faces a charge of obstructing the police during an incident at a Las Vegas restaurant on Jan. 24, but that is no threat to his eligibility. (AP)</p>
