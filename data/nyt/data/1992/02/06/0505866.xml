        <p>A Manhattan garment maker testified in chilling detail yesterday that "four or five guys in trenchcoats" were used to instill fear and enforce what the prosecution said was organized crime's stranglehold on truck deliveries within New York City's garment industry.</p>
        <p>His testimony followed opening arguments in the Manhattan extortion trial of Thomas and Joseph Gambino, the sons of the late Carlo Gambino, the reputed Mafia boss, in which the defense contended that the Gambino name was more of a cursed Mafia legacy than an instrument of fear.</p>

        <p>A Manhattan garment maker testified in chilling detail yesterday that "four or five guys in trenchcoats" were used to instill fear and enforce what the prosecution said was organized crime's stranglehold on truck deliveries within New York City's garment industry.</p>
        <p>His testimony followed opening arguments in the Manhattan extortion trial of Thomas and Joseph Gambino, the sons of the late Carlo Gambino, the reputed Mafia boss, in which the defense contended that the Gambino name was more of a cursed Mafia legacy than an instrument of fear.</p>
        <p>"The prosecution would love to have visions of gangsters dancing in your head and have you hear the theme from 'The Godfather,' " said Joseph Gambino's lawyer, Gerald L. Shargel.</p>
        <p>"But Joe Gambino has known for all his life that no matter how hard he worked or how honest he was, people would look at him and his name -- Gambino -- and say, 'That's Mafia.' "</p>
        <p>"So what's going on here today?" Mr. Shargel asked. "I'll tell you," he said as he reached below the defense table in State Supreme Court and grabbed a large sign emblazoned with the name GAMBINO. "That's what this case is all about," he said as he held the sign up in front of the jury. A 'Mob Tax'</p>
        <p>The defense argument that the Gambino brothers are being smeared and unjustly prosecuted because of their name was intended to counter prosecution charges that they were ranking members of the Gambino crime family that controlled truck deliveries in the garment industry, extorting a "mob tax" on every garment made in the city.</p>
        <p>The prosecution's first witness, Richard Wallace, a garment production manager, testified about what happened when a subcontractor wanted to have a delivery made by someone other than a Gambino trucking company, Consolidated Carriers.</p>
        <p>"I was in this shop when the owner wanted to make a shipment to New Jersey by another trucker," he said under questioning by an assistant district attorney, Eliot Spitzer. "But a Gambino salesman who was there said he couldn't and they had an argument.</p>
        <p>"Within 15 to 20 minutes, four or five guys in trenchcoats walked into the shop and stood around with their hands in their pockets. They didn't say anything. They didn't open their mouths. They just stood there."</p>
        <p>"What did they look like?" Mr. Spitzer asked.</p>
        <p>"They were big, very imposing," Mr. Wallace said.</p>
        <p>"What did you learn from the experience?"</p>
        <p>"That you don't mess around with Consolidated."</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Spitzer asked Mr. Wallace about truck deliveries.</p>
        <p>"Well, the first thing I heard when I entered the business was that the trucks were controlled by organized crime," he said.</p>
        <p>"And what about now?"</p>
        <p>"You have to accept their control -- you have to play the game."</p>
