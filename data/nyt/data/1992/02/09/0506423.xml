        <p>Argentina's decison to open previously secret files on Nazis who fled here after World War II has caused embarrassment to the Government and anxiety among old-line Peronists.</p>
        <p>One of the major embarrassments came when Government officials could not find the file on Adolf Eichmann, the most notorious Nazi known to have fled to Argentina.</p>
        <p>Eichmann, the chief organizer of the extermination of Jews in Nazi concentration camps, was kidnapped by Israeli commandos in 1960 and taken to Israel, where he was tried and hanged.</p>
        <p>"So far we have only a few pages on Eichmann in another file," Interior Minister Jose Luis Manzano said in an interview this week. "The Foreign Ministry says it doesn't have it. We will just have to wait for all the agencies of Government to submit their files."</p>
        <p>Officials had warned that many of the files would be incomplete. Already they have found evidence of missing pages and indications that some files were "cleaned" as early as 1971.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manzano acknowledged that after the kidnapping of Eichmann in 1960, "the Argentine police spent much more time monitoring Jewish organizations here than looking for Nazis."</p>
        <p>Although President Carlos Saul Menem has won praise from other countries for opening the files, he has been criticized by some within his own party, which is one of factions that grew out of the Peronist party, the political organization of the onetime Argentine dictator.</p>
        <p>Long-time supporters of Juan Domingo Peron, who ruled Argentina jointly or alone from 1943-55 and is said to have approved the sale of Argentine passports to fleeing Nazis, fear that new discoveries in the newly opened files will taint Peron's image.</p>
        <p>Jewish organizations in Argentina have also come under criticism. An assembly of representatives from more than 150 labor unions issued a statement charging that a "malicious campaign to tarnish the memory of General Peron" was being waged "by prestigious Jewish community organizations." Peronism drew the bulk of its support from Argentine labor unions.</p>
        <p>Much hostile attention has focused on Shimon Samuels, a 46-year-old historian who traveled here to study the archives as the representative of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, which received the only copy of the documents made public so far. A general distribution is scheduled Monday.</p>
        <p>After a Buenos Aires newspaper published the name of the hotel where Mr. Samuels was staying, he received a number of harassing phone calls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Samuels said that one of his callers, a former policeman, offered to sell him supposed photographs of Martin Bormann, a top Nazi official who was Hitler's personal secretary in the last three years of the war. Some believe Bormann was one of the Nazis who made their way to Argentina after the war although the West German Government ruled that he died in 1945.</p>
        <p>Mr. Samuels said that while he was interested in learning the fate of some 15 Nazis, he was particularly eager to learn about two men who may still be alive: Rudolf Mildner and Heinrich Muller, both former Gestapo officers who Mr. Samuels said may still be living in northern Argentina.</p>
        <p>Even the Argentine authorities have been somewhat surprised by the extent to which some prominent Nazi officials were allowed to move about with virtual impunity.</p>
        <p>Josef Mengele, the doctor who performed grisly experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz death camp, moved to Argentina in 1949 with a Red Cross passport under the name of Gregor Helmut, the documents show. In 1956, he asked the German Embassy to reissue his passport and other documents under his real name. The Germans complied even though a warrant existed for his arrest, according to Mr. Samuels.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the files show that Dr. Mengele asked the Argentine authorities for a document of good conduct so he could travel to Chile. "That shows someone was at least looking the other way," Mr. Manzano said. Dr. Mengele went to Paraguay in 1960 and later moved to Brazil, where he is believed to have drowned in a lake near Sao Paulo in 1979.</p>
