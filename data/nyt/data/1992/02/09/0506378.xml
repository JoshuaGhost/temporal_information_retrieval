        <p>Three score and zero years ago, the 55-story Lincoln office building was built at 60 East 42d Street. On Wednesday at 11:30 A.M. its owners will celebrate the 183d birthday of its namesake, Abraham Lincoln, with a program of his favorite songs and, at the same time, unveil the building's long-awaited refurbishing.</p>
        <p>"Celebrating Mr. Lincoln's birthday with music dear to him is an opportunity to honor a great man and to bring together the tenants of the building and leaders of the business community in the Grand Central Partnership district," said Peter L.

        <p>"Celebrating Mr. Lincoln's birthday with music dear to him is an opportunity to honor a great man and to bring together the tenants of the building and leaders of the business community in the Grand Central Partnership district," said Peter L. Malkin, a principal in the company that owns the building and chairman of the partnership.</p>
        <p>The festivities will include a vocal group that specializes in Civil War-era songs, a birthday cake with 183 candles, 100 revelers in stovepipe hats and an Abraham Lincoln-look-a-like who will sing songs known to be among Lincoln's favorites.</p>
        <p>The refurbishing includes placing bronze plaques with quotations from Lincoln's Gettysburg and second inaugural addresses at the building's main entrance, illuminating the exterior and replacing worn sidewalks and the doors. The lobby already has a small replica of the Lincoln Memorial statue in Washington.</p>
        <p>A new limestone facade and bronze marquee are also planned for the building.</p>
