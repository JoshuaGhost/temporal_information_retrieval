        <p>She wore a designer home-on-the-range outfit: floor-length trail coat, chaps, a broad-brimmed hat.</p>
        <p>But CHRISTIE BRINKLEY came to Belmont Park to work yesterday, giving an exhibition aboard her cutting horse. There were many such events around Belmont Stakes week, dubbed Horsefair '92.</p>
        <p>This was serious business for the model, who performed in a mini-stadium erected near the paddock. Last year, she won the celebrity cutting-horse national title in Texas, defeating such other personalities as MARILYN QUAYLE and TANYA TUCKER.</p>
        <p>Brinkley's husband, singer BILLY JOEL, watched yesterday and said he prefers "just old-fashioned Western riding."</p>
        <p>Some years ago, explained Brinkley, an accomplished rider, "I was asked to help out on a ranch on Long Island and cut some cattle."</p>
        <p>It is a skill that dates from the post-Civil War cattle drives, when horse and rider moved groups of animals by using "cutting" movements.</p>
        <p>"I said if I'm going to help out, then I need a Western horse," Brinkley said. "I watched the competition on TV and I thought it was wild. I bought the learn-to-cut video and learned something about it. Now my dilemma is finding cattle on Long Island."</p>
        <p>And what about her national title? Was the competition tough?</p>
        <p>"Mrs. Quayle didn't have a lot of cow sense," said Brinkley.  SIDELINES: BELMONT STAKES</p>
