        <p>Soul music and gospel-charged dance music are on the program tonight at the Apollo, with the triple bill of Bobby Womack, Junior Walker and the All-Stars, and Loleatta Holloway. Bobby Womack may be best known as the songwriter of "It's All Over Now" (a hit for the Rolling Stones), "Lookin' for a Love" (a hit for the J. Geils Band) and "I'm a Midnight Mover" (a hit for Wilson Pickett). On his own, although he tours too infrequently, he is one of the great soul singers. His voice has a knowing tenderness and an earthy rasp, and his dramatic timing turns songs into gospelly revivals.</p>
        <p>The tenor saxophonist and singer Junior Walker was one of Motown Records' mainstays in the 1960's, with hits like "Shotgun" and "I'm a Road Runner." And Loleatta Holloway brought her extravagantly emotional voice to some of the most fervent records of the disco era, including "Queen of the Night," then dropped out of sight until the pop rapper Marky Mark brought her voice back to the radio with his "Good Vibrations."</p>
