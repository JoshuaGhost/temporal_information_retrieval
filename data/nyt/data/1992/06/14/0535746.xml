        <p>MOST mornings, he sits in his garden hunched over his version of the morning news, The Daily Racing Form. The sun glints on the ever-present gold medallion hanging from his neck, inscribed with lines from the song "St. James Infirmary": "Put a $20 gold piece on my watch chain, so the boys'll know that I died standing pat."</p>
        <p>As he approaches his 85th birthday, Cab Calloway wears the medallion close to his heart, but like most personal matters in the intensely private life of this renowned jazz musician, the medallion is not open to discussion. The bandleader offers a quizzical glance to a question about it but says nothing, turning back to study his horses.</p>
        <p>Most afternoons, he will pack his binoculars, climb into his old Pontiac sedan and head to the Yonkers Raceway, a solitary figure who will spend the next several hours perched on a bar stool in the track's Empire Terrace lounge, absorbed in the action. A Different Person on Stage</p>
        <p>Ah, but at night, on stage once again -- that's a different matter. The legendary entertainer metamorphoses into the Hi-De-Ho man he has been for 60 years, flashing his dazzling smile and throwing his surprisingly agile frame into the familiar routine. The range may be a bit lower, but the voice is surprisingly strong and resonant, sounding much as it did on recordings made 50 years ago.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night, fans of swing will have a rare opportunity to hear Mr. Calloway perform in Westchester, in a benefit opening the 10th anniversary celebrations of the New Orchestra of Westchester. "Cafe Society on the Town," at the State University of New York at Purchase, will feature Mr. Calloway performing such signature songs as "Minnie the Moocher" and "It Ain't Necessarily So."</p>
        <p>The event begins at 6:30 P.M. with a buffet supper, followed by the concert at 8 o'clock. Tickets may be obtained by calling the New Orchestra of Westchester at 682-3707.</p>
        <p>"He's two people," said Nuffie Calloway, his wife of 37 years. "At home, he's a loner who lives in his own space. But walk on stage, and he's another person." When he leaves his dressing room, she said, "It never fails. He steps out and gets a standing ovation before he opens his mouth."</p>
        <p>At home, his five daughters have dubbed the dad who so rarely smiles Chuckles. The children are all devoted to their shy and sensitive father, Mrs. Calloway said, but she described her husband as a man they all respect but don't always understand.</p>
        <p>The medallion, she said, was a gift to her husband from their daughter Lael while he was recovering from emergency surgery for peritonitis.</p>
        <p>Once home, it's always back to the track.  "I hate the horses," Mrs. Calloway said., "but that's what keeps him sane. If anything is bothering him, he can shut it out there."</p>
        <p>What would bother this man, who made his reputation as a singer and Big Band leader at the Cotton Club and hired musicians like Milt Hinton and Dizzy Gillespie? "Nothin' bothers me," he says emphatically. "I have never been afraid of anybody or anything in my entire life."</p>
        <p>Mr. Calloway stands pat, and neither aging nor singing in a lower key nor memories shall stay him. "Forever. I'll sing forever," he says with a rare burst of enthusiasm. "You are born. You live. Why not live forever?"</p>
        <p>After the nation's musical tastes turned to other sounds, Mr. Calloway, whose favorite film role was with Lena Horne in "Stormy Weather," found a new career as an actor. He immortalized the role of Sportin' Life in "Porgy and Bess" -- a character that Calloway, in his 1976 autobiography "Of Minnie the Moocher &amp; Me" (Crowell), says was based on his own flamboyant life -- and played opposite Pearl Bailey in the first black version of "Hello, Dolly!"</p>
        <p>"I've been singing proper for 63 or 64 years," he declared. "I was trained! A trained singer never loses his voice." How much practice is involved? "I don't have to practice; I'm perfect," Mr. Calloway said. "I could do it right now," poking the air with a finger for emphasis. "I've done it so long, if I can't get out and do it now, I'm finished."</p>
        <p>Being a living legend can be burdensome, Mr. Calloway conceded in a rare moment of reflection during a reluctant interview at his home here. He pursues a round of appearances that might exhaust a man half his age -- next week he leaves for a monthlong tour of European jazz festivals -- but Mr. Calloway says, "I have to limit myself." Patting a large stack of mail that threatens to spill onto the office floor, he shakes his full head of wavy white hair and observes, "All over the country, there are people asking me to donate an item, asking for a lock of my hair."</p>
        <p>But "if I like it, I do it," Mr. Calloway said, and he likes Paul Lustig Dunkel, the founding conductor of the New Orchestra who is also, perhaps more important, his racing buddy, one who dared to introduce himself when they crossed paths at the track several seasons ago.</p>
        <p>"I'm doing it for Paul," he said of tomorrow night's appearance at SUNY Purchase. Swiveling around in his chair toward the conductor, who is there for a visit, he stage-whispers, "Amberjack in the fourth." Breaking the Color Barrier</p>
        <p>What could bother this native of Baltimore who became one of the country's most popular showmen and decided to break the color barrier in 1931 by daring to take his black band on tour in the Deep South? Relegated to shabby buses, barred from certain restaurants and restrooms and facing some hostile white audiences, the band played on. And under Calloway's direction, it returned the next year after dropping certain especially unhospitable towns.</p>
        <p>Times have changed, to Mr. Calloway's way of seeing it. "Race is the last thing that comes across my mind," he said. "Prejudice was more prominent in my day than it will ever be."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Calloway filled in some details. "This man can turn anything off," she said, "but he can't make the memories go away." There is a hole in her husband's head the size of a quarter, she said, a result of a clubbing by a Kansas City policeman.</p>
        <p>"Lionel Hampton was playing," she recalled. "Cab bought a ticket, but all he wanted to do was to go backstage and see his friend." The police officer stopped him. 'Concentrate on the Positive'</p>
        <p>Afterward, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People wanted to sue. "Cab said he didn't want to go through with it," Mrs. Calloway said. "Why? I don't know. There are many things about this man I don't know."</p>
        <p>Her husband offers his view. "The accomplishments of the Negro since he has been liberated have been tremendous," Mr. Calloway said. "Look at your businesses. Read Jet. You can see Negro businesses in all parts of the country. People should concentrate on the positive."</p>
        <p>Blacks today have as much opportunity to realize the American dream as anyone else, he said, adding: "Go to school. Finish school."</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Calloway's nine grandsons works at Kidder Peabody, an investment-banking firm. "He works on Wall Street, and he has been there five years," Mr. Calloway said. "Anyone can do it. Millions do it."</p>
        <p>Watch out when someone close to him doesn't follow that prescription. When Chris Calloway came home after three semesters at Boston University and told her father she was giving up college to pursue an entertainment career, Mrs. Calloway recalled, "He threw the television set at her."</p>
        <p>He missed, and his daughter stuck to her goals, becoming a respected singer and dancer in her own right. She will join with her father tomorrow night, singing ballads made famous by Billie Holiday.</p>
        <p>The father-daughter team will be performing only a few miles from the comfortable Colonial-style home the Calloways have owned here for 36 years. They bought the rambling home on a wooded corner lot over the objections of neighbors, who petitioned to keep them out.</p>
        <p>"I felt I had to make a place for Cab in Westchester," said Mrs. Calloway, a sociologist who worked for the United States Department of Labor before she married Mr. Calloway. "I had to represent him as not singing Hi-De-Ho all night, and they had to see me not as someone chewing gum and swinging pearls."</p>
        <p>Soon after arriving, she joined the board of the neighborhood association that had circulated the petitions. "I asked to see the minutes," she said, "but they had torn out the parts related to us."</p>
        <p>In the decades since then, the Calloways have lived harmoniously with neighbors whom Mrs. Calloway called "wonderful."</p>
        <p>"I prefer," she said, "to see the glass half full."</p>
        <p>In a section of her husband's autobiography to which family members contributed reminiscenses, Mrs. Calloway wrote: "One of the mistakes I think that people make when they think about Cab Calloway is to ignore the possibility that inside that energetic, vibrant, vital man projected from the stage beats the heart of an ordinary man who can feel disappointments deeply, who is in his own way very shy and who has been through changes that would have broken a weaker man."</p>
