        <p>There will be an obligatory sixth game in the National Basketball Association finals, but why?</p>
        <p>Even though the Portland Trail Blazers talked about the potential for a comeback after losing, 119-106, Friday night, it seems as improbable as stopping Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers, beaten down thoroughly in the National Basketball Association finals, are likely finished, behind by 3-2 in the four-of-seven-game series and going back to Chicago for their final days of the season.</p>
        <p>Game 6 will be Sunday at Chicago Stadium (Channel 4, 7 P.M.).</p>
        <p>Accused of playing dumb at times, the Blazers have done little to reject that theory. Worse, they are still waiting to push the finals into their pace, the kind of fast-moving, 3-point-shooting, nonstop tempo they used during the regular season and in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>At times, the Trail Blazers have forced the speed of some games, inducing the Bulls to run up and down the court at a breakneck pace and rush themselves into bad passes or poor shots. But more often, the Blazers have been swallowed up by the Bulls, who have shot well, rebounded well, passed well and put the ball in Jordan's hands for their big points.</p>
        <p>And how often have the Blazers been able to make the Bulls play at their pace?</p>
        <p>"Not very much," said Cliff Robinson, the on-again, off-again Portland forward. "We really haven't forced our tempo yet. They're just so quick. They sit back in their transition defense and limit the opposition to anything but easy baskets."</p>
        <p>There had been questions from the beginning about whether the Blazers' style was good enough to win a championship. Most theorists insist that only teams with exceptional defense and a steady half-court offense can reach the top, and perhaps that is the reason the Blazers haven't won a league title since 1977.</p>
        <p>Because they haven't been able to run on the Bulls, the Blazers have struggled, winning the second and fourth games only with late surges.</p>
        <p>"I think a lot has been made of us running up and down the court," said Rick Adelman, the Portland coach. "We've won a lot of low-scoring games, too. But if you turn the ball over, you're going to have a tough time regardless of the style you play."</p>
        <p>Turnovers have been crippling, but the Blazers aren't looking much like the team that finished with the second-best record in the league in any respect. They are, at times, butter-fingered and poor-thinking.</p>
        <p>Some of their passes have wound up in the hands of front-row spectators. The airballs and clunkers they have launched toward the basket -- including a few by Clyde Drelxer -- have almost seemed embarrassing.</p>
        <p>"All season long we've been able to get out of the box quickly," Drexler said. "But Chicago is coming out with a lot of intensity. That's why it's very important to establish the tempo early on Sunday."</p>
        <p>If they do, it would be a first. The Bulls haven't allowed it to happen, and their early leads have forced the Blazers into a helter-skelter offense that has usually misfired. Even their most potent weapon, the three-point shot, has been nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Why? "Because Chicago is a very fine team," said Buck Williams. "It's to their advantage to keep control of the tempo. They do a good job of that. They don't want to run with us, so they keep control of the game, from rebounds to turnovers to missed shots."</p>
        <p>The Blazers weren't counting themselves out, though, even if everyone else was. But this is their problem: No team has come back from a 3-2 deficit in the N.B.A. finals to win the last two games on the road.</p>
        <p>So far, they haven't looked like the kind of team that could alter history. In fact, the Blazers have been outplayed since Game 1, a 122-89 rout by Chicago that doesn't seem so long ago. And as Williams said after his team's loss Friday night, "They played almost flawless basketball."</p>
        <p>But the Blazers insisted there was a chance.</p>
        <p>"We're still in pretty good shape," said Terry Porter, apparently unaware of the past. "It was definitely a tough loss, but this team has bounced back after tough losses before."  BASKETBALL</p>
