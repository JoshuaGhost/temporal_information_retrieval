        <p>A LADYBUG landed on the window the other day. Little did the speck of a creature know that it was being observed from inside the house. An intimate look at this insect provided an opportunity to watch its morning ablutions, which included cleaning off its tiny legs and mouthparts. Then just as quickly the ladybug lifted its wings to make an escape flight, never to be seen again.</p>
        <p>This small insect is one of the most familiar and the one children popularized with the nursery poem:</p>
        <p>Ladybug, ladybug,</p>
        <p>Fly away home.</p>
        <p>Your house is on fire,</p>
        <p>Your children will burn.</p>
        <p>This seemed a curious childhood ditty with little relevance. But a tracing of its origins proved otherwise. The little poem originated in England where it was the custom to burn the hops after harvest. At harvest time, the hop plants were covered with aphids feeding on the multitudinous insects present. The only safe thing for the ladybug to do was fly away.</p>
        <p>Gardeners who see these tiny beetles in their garden have learned to know them as friends not foes. They are insect predators and they have a voracious appetite for one of the garden's most destructive enemies: aphids. It has been calculated that a ladybug can eat as many as 30 aphids in a day in its larval stage, and possibly as many as 50 when it reaches adulthood. In fact, the ladybug is often credited with saving many crops from possible destruction. And it is often sold and shipped to gardeners as a means of biological control.</p>
        <p>Sometimes this effort is successful, and sometimes not. The difficulty lies in the ladybugs themselves. When they are released, they immediately fly off in search of food. If they find enough insects to feed on, fine, but if not, then the ladybugs take off forever to find their food sources. It is much better, in many ways, to encourage the local residency of these beetles so that they can feed on the diet they find.</p>
        <p>Since the ladybug has established its reputation as a predator, some of its favorite meals should be known. It devours not only aphids, but it will also feed on mealybugs, scales and even whiteflies. Its larval stage should also be recognized as too many gardeners do not recognize it, and thus this friendly insect is killed off and never allowed to grow to maturity. Since it is a true insect it goes through a complete metamorphosis in its life cycle.</p>
        <p>In the larval stage, particularly, the ladybug does not look anything like the adult. It more or less resembles a tiny lizard and is oddly colored. Since it is such a rather ugly creature with curious spines and bands, it is often squashed as an enemy, when it should be protected and valued for its voracious appetite. For this reason, many entomologists call this larval stage of the ladybug the aphis wolf.</p>
        <p>When fully gorged, the aphis wolf attaches itself upside down to a leaf where it transforms into the familiar beetle. Since there are 2,000 species of ladybugs, and 150 of them live in the United States, it is difficult to know exactly what colors the beetles will have. Some will have the typical polka dots on red-orange wings. But some are orange, black, yellow, or any combinations.</p>
        <p>The life cycle can be repeated several times in one season to produce many generations a year. One thing is certain, these tiny creatures are welcome wherever they are found. Some of them winter over as adults and cluster together under leaves or bark to keep one another warm.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, the name ladybug is curious, too. Its derivation can be traced to the Middle Ages when a legend was repeated that the insects saved fields of grapevines or grain fields (depending on what you read) from harmful insects. The townspeople were so grateful that they dedicated the tiny insect to "Our Lady." The British refer to these insects as ladybird beetles, while gardeners here usually call them ladybugs.</p>
        <p>As gardeners learn to steer away from chemicals for control of garden pests, the importance of maintaining the ladybug population will become a major factor. Gardeners must learn to identify their enemies and to recognize the beneficial insects.</p>
        <p>One of the best known and easy to recognize is the large praying mantis (the state insect of Connecticut) with its huge head and eyes that turn easily to "follow you" about the garden. There are the beautiful lacewings, which sit atop leaves to show off their elegant wing pattern. There are also the fast-traveling ground beetle with its shiny black back, tiny wasps, honey bees, and ever so many more. Learn to recognize these friends of the garden and give them the chance to do their thing outdoors. They have earned their right to stay.  GARDENING</p>
