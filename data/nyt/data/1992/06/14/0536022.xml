        <p>There are many risks for a sailor at sea with the United States Navy, and some of them have nothing to do with lacerating storms or enemy missiles.</p>

        <p>There are many risks for a sailor at sea with the United States Navy, and some of them have nothing to do with lacerating storms or enemy missiles.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, walking down the hall. On Navy ships, when a woman on duty walks into the male berth she is supposed to announce herself -- "female on board" -- and correct conduct should follow. It doesn't always work out that way.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes a guy will try to make some remark," said Amy Coughlin, a sailor on the Samuel Gompers, which tied up in Seattle this week for a few days of liberty. "I don't want to be treated like a guy, but I expect the men to keep their hands to themselves."</p>
        <p>While the Navy has long had a policy against mistreatment of women, the reality on ships and ashore is another thing. This week, every sailor and officer in the Navy was ordered to undergo training to recognize and prevent harassment and abuse of women. After a series of recent cases where women were disrobed, assaulted or otherwise abused by Navy men, Pentagon officials say they are getting serious about trying to rid the Navy of an ancient legacy. Now 'Thinking Twice'</p>
        <p>Most of the sailors and officers interviewed here, men and women from the Samuel Gompers, a destroyer tender, said they welcomed the Navy's new emphasis. And they told of changes already under way that reflect the influence of women in the Navy.</p>
        <p>Until the last few years, it was common for married men to remove their wedding bands at sea, or to hang large posters of naked women above their beds, or to paint suggestive portraits on torpedoes and airplanes. But with women around, "they are thinking twice about it," said Leah Eckert, a 22-year-old sailor.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if some of these men thank us for helping them change," Ms. Eckert said.</p>
        <p>The Navy's new get-tough policy has been spurred by several highly publicized incidents. Among the recent cases, a female midshipman at the United States Naval Academy was chained to a urinal by male classmates; five Naval fliers were accused of raping a woman at a bachelor party in Virginia, and 25 women said they were sexually assaulted by Navy aviators and their supporters at a convention in Las Vegas last September. Changing Daily Life</p>
        <p>While other branches of the service have known sexual harassment, the Navy has been singled out because of its deeply rooted image of adventure-seeking and promiscuity. When, in the last year, it was reported that a ship captain had been accused of performing oral sex with a prostitute in front of his crew, some Naval officers said it was not a remarkable incident.</p>
        <p>Women in the Navy say most forms of sexual harassment are less violent and more subtle than the incidents that have made headlines. To combat the old attitude, everything from casual remarks to debauched activity at the extreme edge of sailor traditions is now being questioned.</p>
        <p>But the ultimate success or failure of the Navy's new policy will depend in large part on how it translates into day-to-day life in the close quarters of Navy ships.</p>
        <p>As a ship with one of the highest complements of women in the Navy, the Samuel Gompers is a case study in the changes under way. The ship, 645 feet long, is essentially a floating shipyard that services Navy combat vessels. About 30 percent of her crew of 1,500 are women, compared to an overall average of 10 percent among the Navy's 576,000 active-duty members. The Gompers goes to sea for six months at a time and last year served in the Persian Gulf war. Rules on Sex and Dating</p>
        <p>"Some people think the training is a joke," Ms. Coughlin said, as she tied down the lines of the ship. "But the guys are on notice; they have to behave or they are out."</p>
        <p>In ordering last week that all Navy personnel undergo training, Adm. Frank B. Kelso Jr., chief of naval operations, acknowledged that it might take a long time to change attitudes. But in a memo sent out last week to all Navy commanders, he said, "The time for mixed signals is passed."</p>
        <p>Navy officials say they can't change human nature, but they can try to control it. The rules say that two people who are seriously dating must report their romantic involvement to their superiors -- something the sailors say is rarely done. The service prohibits sex on its ships and does not let married couples serve on the same vessel.</p>
        <p>Aboard the Samuel Gompers, men and women sat together in small groups to view videotapes, provided by the Navy, on dos and don'ts of sexual behavior. After the session some of the leering continued, Navy women said, but there was also a noticeable change. 'A Big High School'</p>
        <p>"It's hard enough as it is, men and women this close together," said Elizabeth Rugh, a seaman who's been in the Navy for just under three years. "Sometimes, this boat reminds me of a big high school. You get every type you had in high school, with the difference that we're living together. But I think a lot of the men are starting to get it. The joke is getting old."</p>
        <p>One problem, said Ms. Rugh, is separating natural sexual attraction from misbehavior.</p>
        <p>"People fall in love on the ship -- I know because it's happened to me," said Ms. Rugh. "How do you control that?"</p>
        <p>Both sexes wear the same uniform, the traditional boy-on-the-crackerjack-box design, white shirt and pants with black scarf. Women are allowed to wear facial makeup, but only if applied tastefully.</p>
        <p>The ship's commander, Capt. Charles T. Creekman, said there had been a handful of reported sexual harassment incidents on the Gompers in the last year. He also said he could detect a gradual change in behavior.</p>
        <p>"We're trying to change not just Navy attitudes but society's attitudes as well," said Captain Creekman. More Women, Less Trouble</p>
        <p>The ship was the first in the Pacific fleet to have women serve in her crew. Its executive officer, Lieut. Commander Lesa McComas, is the second-highest ranking officer on the ship.</p>
        <p>"I served in a ship that was nearly all male, so I can tell you the Navy has made significant progress," said Commander McComas. "It's changed people having women on board. The crews are mellower. There are fewer disciplinary incidents. I don't think sexual harassment is widespread."</p>
        <p>Navy officials said they did not know whether the number of sexual harassment cases was going up or down. A 1990 study by the Pentagon found that 62 percent of uniformed women in all branches of the service had experienced some form of sexual harassment. A 1989 study by the Navy found that 42 percent of enlisted personnel and 26 percent of officers had reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment. The most common form reported was "sexual teasing and jokes," but 15 percent reported "pressure for sexual favors."</p>
        <p>"It's subtle," said Lieut. Stacey Rogers. "Since I've been aboard I have never been called 'Sweetie,' but that may be because of my rank."</p>
        <p>Some things, however, seem more ingrained. When the Gompers discharged its sailors for liberty, there appeared to be an equal-opportunity enthusiasm for cruising through Seattle in search of new companions of the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>"Some things go both ways," said Ms. Rugh.</p>
