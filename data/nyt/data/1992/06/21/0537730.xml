        <p>Jin Lee was one Korean shopkeeper who tried to do everything right. He held barbecue parties for his black customers, sponsored a neighborhood basketball team, donated money to an anti-gang youth group and was active in a black-Korean church organization.</p>
        <p>But when rioting swept the neighborhood where he owned a grocery store, his efforts went for nothing. Like hundreds of other Korean shopkeepers, he lost his store to fire.</p>
        <p>"We're not sure what we're going to do now," said Mr. Lee, whose family also lost five other small businesses in the inner city. "Financially and emotionally, we're not ready to go back. We are very frustrated and very angry, and also we are afraid." Battered and Stunned</p>
        <p>Six weeks after the riot, in which some 2,500 Korean-owned enterprises were damaged or destroyed, the nation's largest Korean-American community is economically battered and emotionally stunned.</p>
        <p>One after another, shopkeepers and community leaders said in interviews that they had been brought up short in their headlong pursuit of an American dream of success through hard work. They said they had learned a hard new lesson in stereotyping and political disenfranchisement.</p>
        <p>"It has been a very rude awakening for many Korean-Americans," said Jerry Yu, executive director of the Korean American Coalition, a local advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Abandoned by the overburdened police as their shops were looted and burned, many Korean shopkeepers now feel they are being forgotten by government leaders as they seek to recover from their losses.</p>
        <p>Among other things, they are the prime victims of a new city ordinance aimed at limiting the number of liquor stores that reopen in South-Central Los Angeles, the area that was at the heart of the rioting. 'Lip Service'</p>
        <p>"Some of us thought we were participating in the political process in a way that was meaningful," said Angela Oh, president elect of the Korean American Bar Association of Southern California. "But when it came down to our hour of need, it became very clear that our participation and contributions were perhaps not very meaningful."</p>
        <p>Korean merchants complain that government promises of immediate aid have not been honored and that Small Business Administration loans require documentation that most informally operated Korean businesses do not have. They also say they are unfairly stereotyped as successful, self-sufficient and politically irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Local leaders say the mutual aid system in which Korean businesses support each other with group lending falls far short of the needs of a community that has suffered as much as $400 million in damage.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lee put it: "We are sick and tired of all this lip service. We want to see dollars in our hands. Our ears are happy but our stomachs are still empty." 'It's a War Zone'</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Lee, most Korean shopkeepers remain hesitant about reopening their businesses in the mostly black and Hispanic South-Central area that has come to rely on Koreans for its basic needs.</p>
        <p>"Some are saying they would rather die than be back in South-Central," said Kyeyoung Park, an anthropologist at the University of California in Los Angeles. "It's a war zone there. Since 1990 about 25 Korean merchants have been shot by robbers."</p>
        <p>But Ivan Light, the author of "Immigrant Entrepreneurs" (University of California Press, 1988), a study of Koreans in Los Angeles, noted that in the end, most shopkeepers would have little choice but to return.</p>
        <p>Despite being stereotyped as prosperous, most of the shopkeepers are poor immigrants who work long hours and often remain in debt for years.</p>
        <p>"There will be some pulling out," Mr. Light said, "but most of them don't have any options. That is their livelihood. If they walk away, they have to find a buyer, and who is going to buy their store now?"</p>
        <p>About one-third of Korean businesses in the city are in the South-Central area, about one-third are in adjacent Koreatown, and one-third are scattered elsewhere, he said.</p>
        <p>For the merchants who work in other areas, South-Central Los Angeles remains a fearsome place.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't do business in South-Central," said Mary Seo, who works in her father's auto parts emporium, California Auto Center, in Koreatown. "I've never even been there."</p>
        <p>During the riot, with the police nowhere to be found, armed employees guarded her father's store and tossed back out several gasoline bombs that had come crashing through the windows.  Complaints About Rudeness</p>
        <p>Mrs. Seo said there was some validity to the stereotype of Korean merchants as brusque, a manner that draws frequent complaints from black customers.</p>
        <p>"Some Koreans are rude," said Mrs. Seo, who is 27 years old and who came to the United States as a small child. "When I first went back to Korea I cringed, those people were so rude. Then I went to New York and I realized it's just like New York. It's really fast-paced and very loud."</p>
        <p>But a Korean who works in the South-Central area, Neil Hun, said the stereotypes on both sides were false.</p>
        <p>"It's just a matter of communication," said Mr. Hun, 23, who works at his uncle's gasoline station. "It's not prejudice, because I never have any problems."</p>
        <p>The 1990 census showed that 145,000 people of Korean extraction lived in Los Angeles County, although local estimates put the number much higher. Nearly half of this population supports itself with small retail businesses. Third of Businesses Affected</p>
        <p>By the community's own count, the rioting affected more than a third of the 6,000 Korean-owned businesses in the county. More than half of all businesses destroyed during two days of looting and arson were Korean-owned, Mr. Yu said.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles, with its Korean newspapers, radio and television stations and restaurants, is the strongest magnet for the 20,000 Koreans who migrate to the United States each year.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yu said the intense publicity the riot received in Korea may have changed forever the rosy image of the United States and may slow the flow of immigration.</p>
        <p>"People had these images of wide, tree-lined streets in mostly quiet neighborhoods, where most Americans are white," he said. "My parents live in Korea. They told me that like everyone around the world they saw the violence in Los Angeles, and they are wondering now, 'Well, do I want to go and live there?' "</p>
