        <p>To the Editor: The article by Susan Benner ("Tackling Colorado's 14,000-Footers," May 24) cheered me immensely, because it proved to me that, unlike on Ayer's Rock, no matter how many feet trample up and down Long's Peak, they don't wear a path. There doesn't seem to be a rock out of place since I last saw Long Peak's summit in July 1932.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: The article by Susan Benner ("Tackling Colorado's 14,000-Footers," May 24) cheered me immensely, because it proved to me that, unlike on Ayer's Rock, no matter how many feet trample up and down Long's Peak, they don't wear a path. There doesn't seem to be a rock out of place since I last saw Long Peak's summit in July 1932.</p>
        <p>I climbed Long's Peak twice that summer, once with two fellow students from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and later with my 42-year-old sister, her husband and their teen-age son and daughter. Both times, we went up using the fixed cable that was there then, and which, as I remember, ran from the Boulder Field to the summit on the mountain's north side. We thought it too risky to descend that way, so both times we went back around by the route Ms. Benner describes so clearly. I'm 82 now, and I'll never see that mountain again, but she stirred my imagination and my memories, and for that, I am very grateful. ROBERT H. RAMSEY Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.</p>
