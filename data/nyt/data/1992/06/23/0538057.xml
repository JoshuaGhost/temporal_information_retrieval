        <p>PSYCHOLOGISTS are using ingenious new methods to plumb the unconscious. Their vigorous, systematic exploration is laying bare the basic but ordinarily invisible building blocks of irrational opinion, prejudice and neurosis. Yet they also reveal an unconscious far smarter in some ways than the conscious mind.</p>
        <p>The current scientific look into the mind's shadow regions has allowed researchers to move beyond decades of dogged preoccupation with seeking conclusive empirical evidence that the unconscious mind truly exists. These researchers take its existence for granted; their question is, just how sophisticated are unconscious mental processes?</p>
        <p>None of the researchers suggest that subliminal messages to the unconscious can be powerful enough to move people to suicide, as the bereaved parents of two young rock fans charged unsuccessfully in a lawsuit in 1990. Nor do they support the view that subliminal messages can encourage moviegoers to buy popcorn and soda, as experiments in the 1950's sought to prove.</p>
        <p>Still, "there's now a rigorous and convincing body of research that shows how unperceived events have a palpable influence on our feelings, thoughts and actions," said Dr. John Kihlstrom, a psychologist at the University of Arizona. One sign of the emerging importance of this new view is the current issue of The American Psychologist, which is devoted to scientific reports that explore the abilities of the unconscious mind.</p>
        <p>"We're rapidly revising our theories of the unconscious, expanding its realm in mental life and refining our sense of its geography," said Dr. Mardi Horowitz, a psychiatrist at the University of California Medical School at San Francisco, who edited "Person Schemas and Maladaptive Interpersonal Patterns" (University of Chicago Press, 1992), which describes much of the research dealing with psychotherapy.</p>
        <p>The scientific studies draw a distinction among the various kinds of mental processes that go on beyond the limits of awareness. As Dr. Kihlstrom described in the journal Science in 1987, what occurs in the "cognitive" unconscious are the nonemotional, mechanical parts of perception and activity that, for example, allow people to speak a sentence in keeping with syntactic rules they cannot explain, or move a hand with precision.</p>
        <p>The cognitive unconscious, long thought by most cognitive scientists to be fairly simple-minded, may in fact be extremely intelligent, according to new findings by Dr. Pawel Lewicki of the University of Tulsa. In a major study, he had volunteers sit at a computer screen and push one of four buttons that corresponded to quadrants on the screen in which an "X" appeared, seemingly at random.</p>
        <p>Actually, the X followed a extremely complex pattern determined by 10 simultaneous rules; for example, that after moving twice horizontally, the X would then move vertically. Despite the complexity of the rules, Dr. Lewicki determined that the volunteers unconsciously learned them because their performance became progressively quicker, then rapidly deteriorated after the rules were suspended and the X started moving truly at random.</p>
        <p>"The rules were so complex that if you were told them, you'd need a flow chart to predict the movements with any accuracy," Dr. Lewicki said.  "We offered $100 to anyone who could figure the rules out, but no one, not even a group of psychology professors, was ever able to guess them. Yet the unconscious was able to master them."</p>
        <p>While such studies suggest a smart cognitive unconscious, it is in the "psychodynamic" or "emotional" unconscious that emotions can warp the way people perceive and react.  Other research by Dr. Lewicki shows how even an encounter people are not consciously aware of can become the seed of a bias that over time grows into a full-fledged prejudice.</p>
        <p>In a typical study, Dr. Lewicki showed volunteers a series of computer-generated faces, some of which had been slightly lengthened or shortened. The volunteers, all college students, were told the faces were of college professors who had been rated by their students as either "fair" or "unfair" in their grading. Bias and 'Intuition'</p>
        <p>The students did not know that for those faces of professors who were supposedly fair, the distance between the eyes and mouth was slightly larger than for those who were said to be unfair.</p>
        <p>Then the students were shown another series of such faces and asked to use their intuition to decide which were more fair. "Within the presentation of just 20 faces, people learned to infer fairness from facial proportions, though they were unaware that this was what they were basing their decision on," Dr. Lewicki said. "When we asked what they based their opinions on, they said, 'I was just guessing.' "</p>
        <p>Within a single session, Dr. Lewicki found, about 20 percent of the students' responses showed the bias they had unwittingly learned. In other studies, he has found that such biases become stronger, operating as self-confirming theories about life.</p>
        <p>"These unconsciously developed predispositions are self-perpetuating," Dr. Lewicki said. "Social reality is ambiguous. We don't usually know, for example, who is fair or unfair. So the bias can silently confirm itself by concluding about a certain type of person, "He's unfair," without ever actually testing that conclusion against reality. You just come away from the encounter with the feeling that such-and-such a person is unfair, though you can't say why." Flaw in Memory System</p>
        <p>Such vague feelings have the power of conviction because in memory there is often a flimsy line between fantasy and reality. "A general flaw of our memory system," Dr. Lewicki said, "is that there is no built-in way to distinguish definitively between what actually happened and what was only imagined. Your thoughts and feelings about what happened often have the same status as do memory traces of what really happened."</p>
        <p>Thus, all that is needed for such an unconsciously learned bias to grow stronger, Dr. Lewicki said, "is an ambiguous reality, which your bias interprets for you." He added, "It's the root of prejudice: you become increasingly convinced of your bias in the absence of the chance to disconfirm your beliefs."</p>
        <p>In the experiment, the volunteers learned the "rules" they were taught, "yet they were unable to tell us what rules they were following," Dr. Lewicki said. "They had no ideas they had learned any rules at all."</p>
        <p>Exactly such processes seem to be at work in the formation of the self-destructive emotional habits that bring people to psychotherapy. These habits are the subject of an intensive research effort that is trying to bring a scientific precision to the mapping of neurosis. Ideal Standards and Reality</p>
        <p>"The quality of a person's most basic relationship with his earliest caretakers forms an imprint, which becomes the seed" of an emotional pattern called a schema, said Dr. Lester Luborsky, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has been a leader in this research.  "As those early experiences keep repeating, the schema grows stronger and becomes the basis for the person's main relationship conflicts in later life."</p>
        <p>In an experimental demonstration of one variety of such schemas, Dr. Timothy Strauman, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin, showed that discrepancies between what people felt they should be like and how they actually saw themselves could set off sometimes puzzling emotional responses. In his studies, Dr. Strauman asked volunteers to describe what they were actually like and how they would like to be.</p>
        <p>"We constantly evaluate ourselves against standards we learned early in life, in an unconscious, automatic way," Dr. Strauman said. "When something reminds us of ways we are not meeting those standards, it triggers an emotional reaction. For instance, if you feel you're too fat, anything that reminds you of it will make you feel dejected, if only slightly."</p>
        <p>While people can be aware that this process is going on in their minds, Dr. Strauman's research suggests it may happen far more often unconsciously.</p>
        <p>In his study, Dr. Strauman pinpointed personal standards each of his volunteers felt they had failed to measure up to. He then invited them back for another experiment, ostensibly one about memory, in which the volunteers were asked to say what childhood memories were evoked by each word on a random list. The lists were actually specially prepared for each person to include words relating to their unmet standards.</p>
        <p>"In people for whom being overweight is a conflict, hearing words like 'trim,' 'athletic' and 'attractive' led to negative memories and feelings, even though the words themselves are positive," Dr. Strauman said.</p>
        <p>The most basic such schemas are so pervasive in a person's psychological reality that "you can extract them from a person's accounts of just about any of the close relationships in his life," including with parents, people at work, and especially in romantic involvements, Dr. Luborsky said. He describes his method for detecting these patterns in "Understanding Transference" (Basic Books, 1990).</p>
        <p>Each such core schema has three parts, Dr. Luborsky finds: a basic wish, such as to be loved and nurtured; the anticipated response from others, and the reaction to that response. In one patient studied, for example, the core wish was to assert his independence; his automatic anticipation was that others would thwart this wish and try to control him; his reaction was to become anxious.</p>
        <p>The patient, a man in his 30's who owned a small design firm with his wife, had entered psychotherapy because of anxieties about traveling that became so severe he could not get on an airplane, drive on a highway or even eat in a restaurant. Behavioral Pattern Detected</p>
        <p>Expert judges, analyzing the man's accounts of his relationship with his wife, his father, his staff and his therapist, detected the same core theme at play in each. For instance, with his wife, he repeatedly described anxiety attacks touched off by disputes over what they would do together, like whether to go to the opera as his wife wished, or to a movie, where he would feel relaxed.</p>
        <p>The task of psychotherapy can be conceived of as helping patients become aware of such emotional patterns and to learn to change them."With therapy, attention is drawn to the pattern, and parts of it that were unconscious are brought into a person's awareness," Dr. Horowitz said.  "It helps to give the pattern a label, so you can learn to interrupt the schema early in the cycle and change the outcome. You can learn to challenge the implicit, previously unconscious attitudes that reinforce it."</p>
        <p>Even psychotherapy does not erase the old schema, Dr. Horowitz said.</p>
        <p>"You can always regress to it under stress," he said. " But you can learn and practice an alternative end to the script. After successful therapy, the wishes aren't changed, but when they are activated, the script that follows is more rewarding."</p>
