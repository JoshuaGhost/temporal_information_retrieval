        <p>The worldwide epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, threatens to infect 40 million to 110 million people by 2000, and international efforts to stop the spread of the fatal disease have stalled, a leading AIDS research group said yesterday.</p>

        <p>The worldwide epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, threatens to infect 40 million to 110 million people by 2000, and international efforts to stop the spread of the fatal disease have stalled, a leading AIDS research group said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The conclusions, compiled by 40 experts and researchers from around the world, are far grimmer than those of the World Health Organization, which predicts, at most, 40 million H.I.V.-infected people by 2000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Merson, who heads the AIDS program at the health organization, said its estimates were based on government reports. Many countries suppress reports about AIDS and other diseases, but Dr. Merson said his group would stand by its estimates.</p>
        <p>The new projections, by a group led by Dr. Jonathan Mann of the Harvard School of Public Health, are based on interviews with experts and analysis of hundreds of programs around the world. Many in the group have been forceful advocates of greater efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
        <p>The World Health Organization "is underestimating both the scope of the problem and what will be needed in order to deal with the problem," Dr. Mann said at a news conference in Washington yesterday.</p>
        <p>No country or community has stopped the spread of H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus, and it is spreading with "astounding rapidity" in many areas of the world, he added.</p>
        <p>Even simple things that can be done to prevent the spread are not being done, said Dr. Mann, who formerly headed the global AIDS program at the World Health Organization.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, huge numbers of blood transfusions are being given in many developing countries without any effort to screen the blood for the virus, though tests to do so have been available for seven years. Appeal for New Strategy</p>
        <p>Health officials have not systematically analyzed the hundreds of programs around the world to identify what works in checking spread of the virus, Dr. Mann said.</p>
        <p>These alarming findings are reported in the coalition's book, "AIDS in the World 1992," to be published by Harvard University Press later this year. The report urges world leaders to develop a new strategy to cope with the worldwide epidemic.</p>
        <p>Dr. Merson responded that the annual meeting of W.H.O. last month had adopted "a new global AIDS strategy" that gives countries a framework for battling the epidemic. Details of Epidemic</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mann said the World Health Organization, as an agency of the United Nations, is vulnerable to political pressure from member nations. By contrast, he added, the group he heads is financed by a private Swiss foundation, the Association Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, and its members are freer to speak out.</p>
        <p>The book, edited by Dr. Mann and Dr. Daniel Tarantola and Thomas W. Netter, who are with the International AIDS Center at Harvard, offers these conclusions:</p>
        <p>*AIDS is having a growing impact on women, who now account for 40 percent of H.I.V. infections worldwide, up from 25 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>*AIDS is exploding in Southeast Asia, and by 2000 Asia will overtake Africa with the largest proportion of H.I.V.-infected persons. Asia will account for 42 percent, sub-Saharan Africa for 31 percent, Latin America for 8 percent and the Caribbean for 6 percent.</p>
        <p>*During the next three years alone, the number of infected people who develop AIDS will exceed the total who developed the disease during the entire history of the epidemic.</p>
        <p>*By early 1992, at least 12.9 million people had been infected with H.I.V., including 7.1 million men, 4.7 million women and 1.1 million children. One in five developed AIDS and nearly 2.5 million have died. About 100,000 people now have AIDS.</p>
        <p>*The number of children orphaned by AIDS will more than double in the next three years.</p>
        <p>*A survey of 38 countries showed that one-third of the leaders had never spoken about AIDS; another third had spoken occasionally and only since 1989.</p>
        <p>The major impact of AIDS is yet to come, Dr. Mann said. During the next decade, H.I.V. is likely to reach most communities in the world and "the question is not if AIDS will strike, but only when," he said.</p>
        <p>The coalition noted that there are wide variations in the impact of the disease from region to region, and even area to area within a country.</p>
        <p>The group deplored what it called the "enormous discrepancies between funding for AIDS work in industrialized and developing countries." It noted that no country had made AIDS a health priority and that there had been a substantial turnover in senior leadership of AIDS workers in many countries. Not Enough Money</p>
        <p>In 1990 and 1991, the coalition said, about 6 percent of the worldwide spending for AIDS prevention was in the developing countries that accounted for more than 80 percent of all H.I.V. infections.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the United States spent $2.70 per person and Europeans $1.18 for AIDS prevention, compared with 7 cents per person in sub-Sahara Africa and 3 cents in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Treatment for AIDS is largely the privilege of the industrialized countries, the coalition said. Still, the report said, from 40,000 to 80,000 people are expected to develop H.I.V. infections in the United States this year. In Europe, 75,000 people became infected last year.</p>
        <p>In 1985-91, the researchers found, industrialized countries spent about $780 million for AIDS prevention and care in the developing world. But they are turning away from coordinated efforts to work through bilateral agreements with developing countries, the coalition said. It said it would be much more efficient to channel donations through an agency like the World Health Organization. The Human Rights Issue</p>
        <p>The coalition stressed that the "rights of people with H.I.V. remain in grave peril." More than 50 countries have imposed restrictions on travel and immigration of people with H.I.V. and AIDS, and international efforts to roll back such legislation have stalled, the coalition said.</p>
        <p>One reason for such travel controls is the high risk that 57 countries face of an explosive spread of H.I.V., including such densely populated nations as Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mann said that the scores of programs aimed at stopping the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus were incomplete "because they have not considered what they could have learned from programs in other parts of the world to see what works, evaluate it, and then spread the information around." 'So Much Waste'</p>
        <p>Dr. Mann said, "There is no document saying, here is what is essential to all programs." Instead, "there is so much waste, so much reinvention of the wheel."</p>
        <p>"The world is still handicapped in the battle against AIDS," he concluded, "by debating whether it is O.K. to distribute condoms, exchange needles, give sex education, whether people with AIDS deserve care that they obviously deserve."</p>
