        <p>Responding to apparent discrepancies, Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett 3d provided new details today of his actions at a convention of naval aviators last year in Las Vegas, where 26 women were assaulted.</p>
        <p>The more detailed description, relayed by a spokesman, came after the Navy released new investigatory reports that had been omitted from a report in April. These reports quoted a Marine captain as saying that Mr. Garrett "came by" one of the hotel suites where squadrons were holding parties featuring pornographic movies, strippers and free beer.</p>
        <p>While asserting again that he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing at the convention and saw nothing offensive, Mr. Garrett said today that he went to the entrance of one suite on the third floor to get a can of beer. In previous statements, Mr. Garrett had said he was on an outdoor terrace while the assaults took place and was not aware of them until weeks later.</p>
        <p>Exactly where Mr. Garrett and senior Navy officers were at the convention and what they saw is significant because investigators said that the lewd and rowdy behavior on the third floor was well-known among those at the convention. When Mr. Garrett became Navy Secretary in 1989, he proclaimed a ban on lewd behavior and sexual harassment, issuing a "zero-tolerance" policy.</p>
        <p>The behavior of Navy officers at the Las Vegas convention has led to a far-reaching Navy investigation, the reassignment of an admiral and a new training program for all Navy personnel.</p>
        <p>Although the Naval Investigative Service released a 2,000-page report on April 29, the 55 pages that included the interview with the Marine captain and the only mention of Mr. Garrett were not released until today. Mr. Garrett said he had asked the Pentagon's Inspector General to investigate why the 55 pages were omitted from the earlier report.</p>
        <p>The Navy said the documents were a "supplemental report" about which Mr. Garrett was told on June 10. Because of the delay in receiving the additional documents and having his own name show up in one, Mr. Garrett requested the Pentagon inquiry to avoid "any appearance of conflict of interest," Navy officials said.</p>
        <p>The women who were assaulted, including 14 officers, said they were mauled and manhandled in the third-floor hallway of the Las Vegas Hilton.  The hallways connected about 20 "hospitality suites" that aircraft squadrons rented to throw rowdy parties.</p>
        <p>One document was an interview with a Marine Corps captain who testified that Mr. Garrett "came by" the "Rhinoceros Suite." Inside the suite, officers goaded female guests to drink from a dispenser shaped like a rhinoceros penis. Officers also sang lewd songs and shouted abusive comments at female guests, the Marine officer said.</p>
        <p>In a copy of the interviews made available by the Navy today, the investigators mainly questioned members of a former Marine reconnaissance aircraft squadron, VMFP-3, from El Toro, Calif., that rented the "Rhinoceros Suite."</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett, who attended the conference, had said he spent 30 to 45 minutes on a terrace just outside the suites but never noticed anything amiss. The suites open on one side onto a hallway and on the other onto the terrace, which can be reached without passing through the suites.</p>
        <p>Today, the Navy broadened Mr. Garrett's versions of events on the Saturday evening of the convention to include that Mr. Garrett fetched a can of beer from a container near the outside entrance to one suite.</p>
        <p>"He took a can from the container and immediately returned to the area on the patio where he had been," said a Navy spokesman, Lieut. Bob Ross. "He does not recall speaking to anyone while he was in the area of the entrance to the suite, although he may have."</p>
        <p>The Marine Corps captain, who was not identified in an edited version of his inverview with naval investigators on Feb. 19, also said that "senior officers made a point of stopping in the suite." The officers' names were excised from the document made available today.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the investigators found that for at least the previous two conventions of the Tailhook Association, a private group of active-duty and retired naval aviators, officers formed gantlets in a crowded corridor of the hotel and shoved terrified women down a river of groping arms.</p>
        <p>Comdr. Bill Harlow, a spokesman for Mr. Garrett, said today that when the Navy Secretary attended the convention, he and members of his staff visited several suite, but "doesn't remember seeing any offensive conduct in the vicinity."</p>
        <p>The Naval Investigative Service has never interviewed Mr. Garrett about what he did at the convention, because investigators said there was no reason to.  Inquiry on Delay</p>
        <p>A Defense Department spokesman, Pete Williams, said Mr. Garrett notified Defense Secretary Dick Cheney last Friday that he had asked the Pentagon Inspector General to determine why the "supplemental report" was so late.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Powers, director of investigations and counterintelligence for the Naval Investigative Service, said in an interview that the Navy had ordered him not to discuss the matter pending the Inspector General's findings.</p>
        <p>A senior Navy official said, however, that such "supplemental reports" were not uncommon, and that Mr. Garrett was reacting strongly because his name had shown up for the first time in more than 1,500 interviews.  Garrett Condemned Conduct</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett has condemned officers at the convention who tacitly condoned the assaults, failed to stop them or stymied investigators who later asked questions about about the incidents.</p>
        <p>It was unclear, though, why the Navy waited until today to make public Mr. Garrett's request to the Inspector General, even though senior Navy officials knew about the request and the supplemental report last Friday.</p>
        <p>"I just don't have an answer for you," said Rear Adm. Brent Baker, the Navy's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garrett has said he did not learn about any of the assaults until three weeks after the convention. Yet the same night Mr. Garrett was on the terrace, one of his top aides, Lieut. Mike (Trusty) Steed, learned of the assault when one of the victims, an admiral's aide, told him and asked him to escort her from the hotel. Lieutenant Steed has declined to comment on the incident.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 20, 1992, Saturday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about a Navy investigation of a 1991 aviators' convention referred incorrectly in some copies to the year the Navy Secretary visited several hotel suites used by conventiongoers. A Navy spokesman, Comdr. Bill Harlow, said the Secretary, H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, visited the suites during the convention in 1990.</p>
