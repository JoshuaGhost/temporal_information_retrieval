        <p>Playtex Apparel has shifted its $40 million worldwide account to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. The move ends a 21-year relationship with Grey Advertising that was broken off at the behest of Playtex's new parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, which wanted to limit the number of agencies handling its advertising.</p>
        <p>Now that it has won the account over Interpublic Group's Lintas, Saatchi faces another challenge: freshening the image of Playtex Apparel's core brands -- its Cross-Your-Heart and 18-Hour bras -- to bring in new customers while not alienating its faithful buyers. "We want to broaden our franchise," said Lee Chaden, president of Playtex Apparel U.S.</p>

        <p>Playtex Apparel has shifted its $40 million worldwide account to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising. The move ends a 21-year relationship with Grey Advertising that was broken off at the behest of Playtex's new parent, the Sara Lee Corporation, which wanted to limit the number of agencies handling its advertising.</p>
        <p>Now that it has won the account over Interpublic Group's Lintas, Saatchi faces another challenge: freshening the image of Playtex Apparel's core brands -- its Cross-Your-Heart and 18-Hour bras -- to bring in new customers while not alienating its faithful buyers. "We want to broaden our franchise," said Lee Chaden, president of Playtex Apparel U.S.</p>
        <p>That will include changing the company's five-year-old tagline, "The fit that makes the fashion."</p>
        <p>Mr. Chaden said Playtex had selected Saatchi in February for its $15 million United States account, but delayed the announcement until Playtex's European operations, representing $25 million in business for Saatchi, also signed on. He added that he had been impressed by Saatchi's work on other Sara Lee brands: Hanes and L'eggs Hosiery. "They did a good job of balancing functional products with the fashion component and emotional overtones," Mr. Chaden said.</p>
        <p>To choose a new agency quickly, Playtex did not ask for creative proposals from Lintas and Saatchi when Playtex got in touch with them last December, a month after the formerly private Playtex was acquired by Sara Lee. Mr. Chaden had planned to base his decision on intuition and each agency's creative philosophy, but they both submitted consumer research and thoughts on positioning and strategy.</p>
        <p>Saatchi's office in France will be the lead agency for Europe. The new advertising is scheduled to begin in mid-August on television.</p>
