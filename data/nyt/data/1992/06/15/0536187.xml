        <p>The international Formula One circuit, which is trying to strengthen its American audience, probably didn't do much to that end with today's Canadian Grand Prix, which Gerhard Berger won in a McLaren-Honda without having to work too hard to pass anyone.</p>
        <p>Berger, a 32-year-old Austrian, started fourth and took advantage of the misfortunes of the drivers in front of him. The three drivers who followed him across the finish line never gained a single position while at racing speed throughout the 69-lap, 189.9-mile race.</p>

        <p>The international Formula One circuit, which is trying to strengthen its American audience, probably didn't do much to that end with today's Canadian Grand Prix, which Gerhard Berger won in a McLaren-Honda without having to work too hard to pass anyone.</p>
        <p>Berger, a 32-year-old Austrian, started fourth and took advantage of the misfortunes of the drivers in front of him. The three drivers who followed him across the finish line never gained a single position while at racing speed throughout the 69-lap, 189.9-mile race.</p>
        <p>Michael Schumacher of Germany, who started fifth in a Benetton-Ford, was second, also using other drivers' mishaps to move up, as did Jean Alesi of France, who drove a Ferrari to third. Karl Wendlinger of Austria, fourth in a March-Ilmor, gained two spots in the traffic jam from the standing start that is used to get Formula One races under way. But once the cars got up to full speed, he fell in line and waited like everybody else.</p>
        <p>In fact, through the first 35 laps of the race, all the changes in the top 10 positions occurred when a driver crashed or broke down. Leaders in a Battle</p>
        <p>Actually, Berger did pass Riccardo Patrese of Italy for second place on the 15th lap, but that only happened because Patrese had to slow to avoid the wreck of his Williams-Renault teammate, Nigel Mansell of England.</p>
        <p>That wreck, at the chicane leading to the front straight, was the most exciting moment in this race. As Ayrton Senna of Brazil, the leader, approached the quick right-left combination, Mansell tried to outbrake Senna's McLaren-Honda for the lead. Mansell slid off the track, flew over a gravel pit designed to slow out-of-control cars and actually passed Senna before his battered car stopped in the middle of the front straight.</p>
        <p>Mansell said that he thought the accident wasn't his fault but declined to comment further. Television replays were inconclusive on whether Senna touched Mansell, and Senna's car did not appear to be damaged.</p>
        <p>Mansell still leads the championship standing after 7 of the 16 races. He has 56 points to Patrese's 28 and Schumacher's 26. Each race victory is worth 10 points.</p>
        <p>Senna kept the lead, pursued by Berger, until his car stopped with electrical problems on Lap 38. Berger inherited the lead, and when Patrese retired with a broken gearbox, Berger's last challenger was gone.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this race -- at least for American fans -- was the two men walking instead of driving around this track. Al Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti, two of Indy-car racing's biggest stars, were prowling the pits this weekend, looking into the possibility of going into Formula One racing.</p>
        <p>Unser, who won the Indianapolis 500 three weeks ago, has driven some tests for the Williams team. Andretti, whose father, Mario, was the 1978 Formula One champion, is particularly eager to jump to the international circuit.</p>
        <p>"There's a lot happening, a lot of possibilities," Andretti said on Saturday when asked about his 1993 Formula One job prospects. "It's probably a little premature right now. We have to see if there's some move made in the drivers' department."</p>
        <p>He was referring to the annual game of musical chairs in Formula One that is triggered as soon as the first prominent driver changes teams.</p>
        <p>Andretti has a contract as a part-time test driver for Team McLaren, whose drivers have won seven of the last eight world championships. Ron Dennis, the team's director, said on Saturday that the contracts of both his drivers, Senna and Berger, expire after this season.</p>
