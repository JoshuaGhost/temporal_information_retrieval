        <p>This city's Police Department, praised last month for keeping the peace in the wake of the Rodney G. King verdicts and the Los Angeles riots, is now facing a crisis of confidence.</p>
        <p>Six officers have been suspended without pay, their guns confiscated, in an investigation by the Essex County prosecutor's office into the shooting of a suspected teen-age car thief and a possible cover-up.</p>
        <p>It was a stark challenge from within to the integrity of a department recast in the last dozen years as an ethnically diverse and more sensitive force. Younger and less white with each new class of recruits, it is a department still seeking to define its role in a city where the adversaries are drugs and car thefts, the suspects often angry, idle teen-agers. New Police Director</p>
        <p>In the year since the arrival of William R. Celester as Police Director, the department has redoubled efforts begun in the early 1980's to expand on a patrol theory called community policing. Mr. Celester arrived from Boston, where he was a deputy superintendent covering the racially mixed, working-class section of Dorchester and the largely black Roxbury area.</p>
        <p>Like Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown in New York City, Mr. Celester believes that officers should get out of their cars and meet the people. It is a different approach from the one in Los Angeles, where, in part because of sprawling territory, heavily armed officers seal themselves in cruisers, anonymous and menacing.</p>
        <p>But the shooting of 17-year-old Howard Caesar as he ran from a stolen car an hour before dawn last Tuesday revived concerns that the police, particularly young ones, are trigger-happy. A year ago, a 23-year-old rookie was charged with official misconduct for failing to report that he had discharged his gun in an incident in which more than 40 shots were fired into a stolen van in nearby Hillside, killing a pregnant teen-ager and a 20-year-old man.</p>
        <p>Of the six officers suspended after Mr. Caesar was shot, four were under 28 years old and three had been on the force 18 months or less. It is still not clear who shot Mr. Caesar, who remains in critical condition and on life support at University Hospital. More Accountability</p>
        <p>Mr. Celester has made a number of organizational changes in Newark intended to require more accountability from those on patrol and from their superiors. He has also posted two community relations officers in each of Newark's four precincts, whose mission is to deal with the quality-of-life problems -- garbage, abandoned cars, broken playground lights -- that can lure or sustain a crime problem.</p>
        <p>And while citizens are quick to praise Mr. Celester's initiatives, he and the department remain stymied by a seemingly intractable problem, one that was cited in an official state report on the 1967 Newark riots: "The ordinary citizen's reaction to the Police Department is twofold: he accuses the police of brutality while he complains of a lack of adequate protection and service."</p>
        <p>"It's an I.R.A. kind of conflict between the kids and the cops," said Lawrence Sherman, a criminologist at the University of Maryland. "People want something done about crime, and they fight back with more crime.</p>
        <p>"It's a critical challenge for community policing. The proven techniques against auto theft involve stopping and questioning. Police have to rely on their second sense, their instincts. That's when people get into their defensive mode."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman said Newark was typical of cities undergoing what he called the second generation of police reform: black-run police departments being criticized by black populations. He called law-enforcement tactics that provoked criticism "endemic to the police task," and said they were not intended as "oppression of minorities." 'Yes, Sirs' and 'Yes, Ma'ams'</p>
        <p>Edna Thomas, who runs a drug-treatment program called Soul House in Newark, said that Newark police officers were improving, but that adults were perhaps the chief beneficiary. "You hear lots of 'yes, sirs' and 'yes, ma'ams,' " she said. "But I still believe that every teen-ager is looked on as a suspect. And I think a lot of people have accepted the idea of police shooting kids, because it seems like there's no stopping car theft. That's troubling me. That's really troubling me, but they seem to be able to accept the fact that car theft and shooting is part of Newark."</p>
        <p>Mr. Celester, who is 49 years old and spent 23 years on the Boston force, took over the 1,100-member Newark department last June, and has continued the efforts of his predecessors to make the force more responsive to the community, particularly those of Hubert Williams, who is credited with reshaping the department. The state report on the riots in 1967 cited the Police Department's harsh reputation as a cause. Two officers and 23 citizens died. More Minority Officers</p>
        <p>Once nearly all white in a city with a black and Hispanic majority, Newark's force has a membership now almost 40 percent minority, a figure that is rising with each Police Academy class. The force is also getting younger, with the average age now 28.</p>
        <p>Mr. Celester has reorganized the 1,100-member department, decentralizing the office in the hopes of better serving the city's 275,000 residents.</p>
        <p>Virtually every level has been affected. Mr. Celester divided the department into two commands -- "self-sustaining mini-departments" -- each with two districts, as precincts are called here. Each district is divided into 7 to 10 sectors, and usually one patrol car is assigned to each, in order to cover every area of the city.</p>
        <p>He also added two mini-precincts in high-traffic, high-crime neighborhoods and reassigned officers from desk jobs to the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Community leaders generally praise these changes. Victor DeLuca, executive director of the Newark Coalition for Low-Income Housing, said, "The administrative shifts in the last six to eight months have definitely brought more police on the streets."</p>
        <p>George Branch, a City Councilman representing the troubled Central ward, said, "We've come a long way," referring to changes since the 1967 riots.</p>
        <p>"The new Police Director asked the community for input and requested that it get involved by reporting crimes and letting the police in on what's going on," Mr. Branch said. Fears of Inexperience</p>
        <p>But Mr. DeLuca and others also worry about some of the complaints they have heard from residents about inexperienced officers' taking liberties with their jobs, especially in handling young car thieves.</p>
        <p>"I think last week's incident might cause the Police Department to look at its training at the Academy," he said. "I would hope that they take the incident as a signal to re-evaluate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Branch echoed the sentiment, adding: "All the complaints I hear are from folks complaining about the actions young officers are taking," he said.</p>
        <p>Since a residency requirement was imposed on recruits in 1989, 111 black officers, 75 whites and 62 Hispanic people have graduated from the Police Academy. But critics like Ralph T. Grant, a City Councilman-at-large, noted that the law required an officer to be a resident only at the time of appointment. "A person can be sworn in at 12 o'clock and move to Clark at 12:05," he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Grant, who rates the Police Department about a "B-minus," said the perception among too many residents was that the officers still had not learned to use their guns only as a last resort.</p>
        <p>"For some reason, blacks and Hispanics are still a target among officers, young or not," he said.</p>
        <p>On the streets near West Side Park, youths last week spoke of officers throwing bricks at speeding, stolen cars or stopping people for no reason.</p>
        <p>Despite efforts by some community leaders, there is no civilian review board to monitor police conduct.  Blatant Car Thefts</p>
        <p>With the highest per capita rate in the nation, car theft in Newark is a major challenge. Teachers' cars are stolen from school playgrounds, which have been turned into padlocked parking lots out of desperation. The Essex County prosecutor's car has been stolen. So was the superintendent of schools', as he addressed a forum on car theft.</p>
