        <p>Manufacturing companies were divided last week in their reactions to a judge's potentially far-reaching decision to consolidate 44 separate suits in Brooklyn Federal Court for hand injuries allegedly caused by repetitive motions.</p>
        <p>Michael Cerussi, a lawyer for International Business Machines, said he was not necessarily displeased by the ruling of Judge Jack B. Weinstein. "What'll happen now is that I.B.M. is going to have the opportunity to get heard on the merits of this sooner rather than later."</p>
        <p>But Arthur J. Liederman, representing Matsushita Electronics and C. Itoh, said the cases shouldn't be combined because of the dissimilarity of equipment that has supposedly led to the injuries. "It's one thing if somebody is exposed to asbestos," he said. "That's one fiber, one product."</p>
        <p>Plaintiffs range from stenographers and postal workers to word processors and journalists. Defendants include Apple Computer, A.T.&amp; T., I.B.M. and Atex, whose parent company is Eastman Kodak.</p>
        <p>Plaintiffs say routine use of equipment such as computers, supermarket check-out scanners and other devices can overtax muscles and tendons in the wrists and forearms, causing swelling, inflammation, numbness, tingling and pain.</p>
        <p>The consolidated cases were assigned to Judge Denis R. Hurley who must rule, before a trial, on whether there are factual, legal and scientific issues in common.</p>
        <p>The heart of the case would be whether there is any such thing as repetitive stress injury, as the hand problems are called, and if so, who is responsible for the injuries that doctors say can require from three months to two years to overcome.</p>
