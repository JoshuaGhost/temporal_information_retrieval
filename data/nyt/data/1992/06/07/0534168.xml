        <p>Sarajevo today endured the most sustained bombardment from artillery, mortar and rocket batteries since the siege of the Bosnian capital began two months ago. The shelling dashed hopes for relief among the city's frightened, hungry people.</p>
        <p>A flurry of United Nations activity on Friday spurred the first flickering prospects of a turn for the better since this medieval city, home to 560,000 people before the fighting, began its descent into an endless round of shelling, street-to-street fighting and sniper fire.</p>
        <p>Most hopes centered on a tentative United Nations plan to reopen the airport for desperately needed food and medicine, a development that followed the United Nations-brokered evacuation of a huge, 20-block Yugoslav military barracks that had been the major Serbian stronghold in the city.</p>
        <p>In basement shelters and sandbagged arcades, thousands of people tuned in to radio broadcasts reporting the United Nations' proposal to take control of the airport from Serbian forces, and celebrated the barracks' evacuation, a symbolic triumph for Bosnian forces defending the city.</p>
        <p>But morale began to sag as the complications of enforcing the airport accord sank in, and disappeared entirely as Serbian gunners in the surrounding hills began a new barrage.</p>
        <p>At dusk today, after more than 24 hours of almost continuous bombardment, the gunners showed no sign of relenting. Every few minutes, 120-millimeter artillery shells, 82-millimeter mortars and volleys from multiple rocket launchers poured down from the slopes of the 5,345-foot Trebevic Mountain, overlooking the city to the south, as well as from other positions across the valley floor to the north. Trapped by Shelling</p>
        <p>Where Olympic athletes in the bobsled and luge events competed only eight years ago, when Sarajevo was host of the Winter Olympics, Serbian commanders in forested redoubts appeared to be taking aim at civilian areas of the city.</p>
        <p>For a handful of Western reporters who entered the heart of the city from the Serbian-held Western suburbs on Friday, the desperation of the people trapped by the siege, said by city officials to number as many as 300,000 to 400,000, appeared to exceed anything experienced in Europe since the devastation of World War II. Almost every major building in the city has been severely damaged, some by more than 100 hits by high-explosive shells.</p>
        <p>Amid the chaos, with surgeons operating by candlelight and the few ambulances that remain mobile tearing through deserted streets at close to 100 miles an hour, nobody appears to have any estimate of the number killed and wounded. But the figure must be high.</p>
        <p>Along Marshal Tito Street in the Eternal Flame District of the city center, named for the flame lighted for the victims of the city's Nazi occupiers in World War II, neo-baroque buildings dating from the 40-year period of Austrian occupation before World War I are a gallery of shell holes. The upper floors are almost all private apartments, and few of those facing the hills have escaped without at least severe shrapnel blasts. Destroying a City</p>
        <p>"We are being driven crazy by this," said Sakir Dzirlo, a 43-year-old electrical engineer, who lives in a turn-of-the-century building along Marshal Tito Street with his wife, Amra, a 40-year-old architect, and their four children. For weeks, the family has survived on loaves of bread bought from daily delivery trucks that risk the hazardous journey through the city's streets, and on occasional supplies of rice obtained in barter with friends. For long periods, sometimes days, they have no water, and electrical power fails with almost every nightly shelling attack.</p>
        <p>Although ethnic armies of Serbs on one side and Muslim Slavs and Croats on the other are fighting the war for Sarajevo, and for wide areas of the newly independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbian guns on the hillsides have made victims of Serbs, Muslim Slavs and Croats alike.</p>
        <p>Throughout the capital today, those huddling for protection from the shellfire were an ethnic cross-section of the city, sharing meager food, and luxuries like scarce copies of the two newspapers that are still publishing, without regard for the ethnic and religious differences that underlie the fighting.</p>
        <p>In dozens of discussions, not a single voice was raised against what seemed to be a common perception: that the Serbian gunners, their passions raised by Serbian nationalist politicians who want to partition this former Yugoslav republic into ethnic enclaves, have opted to destroy as much of the city as possible if they cannot have it for themselves, and, to judge by the intensity of the latest shelling, to do the job as quickly as possible.  Freeing an Airport</p>
        <p>"Tell the world I'm ashamed, absolutely ashamed, of what the Serbs are doing," a middle-aged Serbian woman told a visitor to the three storage rooms at the rear of a shopping arcade off Vase Miskina Street.</p>
        <p>Another view that was practically universal was that the outside world -- and in most conversations, that quickly turned out to mean the United States -- should intervene immediately with military power. The Sarajevo television station, still transmitting for the Bosnian Government of Muslim Slavs and Croats despite repeated shelling of its transmitter tower, showed pictures today of President Bush telling a news conference on Friday that "prudence and caution prevents military actions" and the reaction among those who saw the broadcast was uniformly one of disappointment.</p>
        <p>For the moment, hopes are focused on the United Nations announcement that an agreement has been reached in principle to reopen Butmir Airport, about six miles from the city in the southwestern outskirts, which is held by the Serbian forces. Because the agreement would involve a major strategic concession by the Serbs, there have been serious doubts here that it will be put into effect soon.</p>
