        <p>As 15,000 university students added their voices today to mounting protests calling for a change of government, legislators from Serbia and Montenegro, the only remaining republics in the Yugoslav federation, elected a 71-year-old author of best-selling Serbian sagas as President.</p>
        <p>The rally ended with students breaking into smaller groups to begin sit-down strikes at the university to press demands for the resignation of the government of the Serbian republic.</p>
        <p>At the Federal Assembly, 169 representatives chose Dobrica Cosic (pronounced doh-BREE-tsah CHO-sitch) as President of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>But it was unclear how political power would be apportioned. The president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, has held paramount authority in the two-republic federation. Montenegro technically has equal standing, but the President of Montenegro, Momir Bulatovic, has been essentially a junior partner.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Cosic, who has considerable popularity as a best-selling author and an ardent promoter of Serbian dreams, will want or be able to pursue policies independent of Mr. Milosevic remained an open question.</p>
        <p>It was also unclear if Mr. Cosic, a member of no party and a longtime critic of Communism, might damp the growing protests aimed at Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Asked during a televised interview whether his election heralded the end of Mr. Milosevic's reign, he replied, "This is not in my competence to say."</p>
        <p>In his acceptance speech, the white-haired Mr. Cosic was conciliatory, saying he wanted "peace and cooperation with all neighbors, the United States and the whole world community."</p>
        <p>But then he cited as his immediate concerns the seemingly contradictory goals of getting United Nationis sanctions lifted and supporting Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia. The sanctions were instituted in part to force the Serbs out of Bosnia.</p>
        <p>He said he favored negotiations between the Socialists, as ex-Communists in power now call themselves, and the opposition and wanted "to finally get rid of the remains of Communism and to have Yugoslavia become a modern, lawful and democratic state." Mr. Cosic, who had joined the Communist Party as a wartime partisan in 1941, was expelled in 1968.</p>
        <p>The new federal President appears to have no differences with Mr. Milosevic on the issue of Serbian nationalism. Mr. Cosic's works include several multi-volume sagas tracing the agonies and sacrifices of Serbian families from the period of World War I to the Tito period after World War II.</p>
        <p>In 1986 he helped draft a memorandum for the Serbian Academy of Sciences describing Serbs as the most politically aggrieved peoples of Yugoslavia. The issuance of that document is usually cited here as the moment when Serbian nationalism began to soar, and Mr. Cosic is often described as the godfather of the policies that Mr. Milosevic turned to when he began to change his political persona from Communist to nationalist.</p>
        <p>Several people who know both men suggested that should the clamor for Mr. Milosevic's resignation prove irresistible, Mr. Milosevic may be able to turn over power to Mr. Cosic and retreat with some dignity.</p>
        <p>After the vote, Gen. Zivota Panic, the head of the armed forces, said the appointment of the writer "was an excellent solution.</p>
        <p>The first order of business for Mr. Cosic, Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Bulatovic of Montenegro was the naming of a federal Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulatovic, who had been promised that the first federal President would be from Montenegro, said he could understand why a man of Mr. Cosic's qualification was selected, but he was clearly unhappy with calls by some legislators to install a Serbian-born American millionaire from California as the Prime Minister. The man, Milan Panic, who developed pharmaceutical companies, was being actively touted for the post by several influential legislators.</p>
        <p>"Things have to be done right," Mr. Bulatovic said, alluding to a constitutional stipulation that when the President is from one republic, the Prime Minister should be from the other.</p>
