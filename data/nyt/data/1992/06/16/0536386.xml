        <p>Willie Randolph's locker is in such a far corner of the Mets' clubhouse, it is almost as if he wishes he were in the next room.</p>
        <p>"Look at that," the Mets' second baseman said of the mob scene caused by about two dozen reporters in the locker room before the slumping Mets opened a three-game set with the Montreal Expos last night. Microphones, tape recorders, ballpoint pens were being waved like a roomful of on-deck hitters.</p>
        <p>"How can you keep your mind on what's important when you have the constant questioning and second-guessing?" Randolph said.</p>
        <p>He may be a first-year Met, but Randolph is a native New Yorker who served his time with the Yankees from 1976 to 1988.</p>
        <p>"Hey, I was with the 1978 club that trailed the Red Sox by 14 games and we won the pennant," he said. "Bucky Dent. If there hadn't been a newspaper strike, we might never have come back. All we would have heard about was negativism."</p>
        <p>That is pretty much what he is hearing about these days with New York's other team, which is off to an 0-4 start on a 14-game homestand, has a 29-33 record and is 7 games from first place but only a half-game from last.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to talk about what's happened so far," Randolph said. "Nobody does. I don't want to talk about the future. I want to talk about now."</p>
        <p>But he talked about the future anyway, from the perspective of someone who, in three weeks, will be 38 years old.</p>
        <p>"When you're a player, you know what you've got and you know what kind of team you're on. We score 15 runs against Pittsburgh and get shut out the next night. How can you figure it? What does it mean? Does it mean we can't score runs after we go and score 15?</p>
        <p>"We've got the same talent here we had when the season started. I just don't believe we won't win games. But you've got to keep things positive. With 100 games left, so much can happen."</p>
        <p>He said his experience with New York allowed him to put up with "the second-guessing you get from all sides."</p>
        <p>"Other guys aren't used to it," he added. "In New York, there's just so much that gets said."  BASEBALL</p>
