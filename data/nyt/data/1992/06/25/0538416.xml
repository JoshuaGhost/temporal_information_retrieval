        <p>The sure-thing selection process ended with the fourth pick of the 1992 National Basketball Association college draft tonight, and that's when the real lottery of talent began. From the fifth pick on down, it was a question of taking a player and a chance.</p>
        <p>As expected, the Orlando Magic took Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1-inch, 294-pound center from Louisiana State, while 6-10 Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning went to the Charlotte Hornets, 6-11 Duke forward Christian Laettner to the Minnesota Timberwolves and 6-6 Ohio State swingman Jim Jackson to the Dallas Mavericks.</p>

        <p>The sure-thing selection process ended with the fourth pick of the 1992 National Basketball Association college draft tonight, and that's when the real lottery of talent began. From the fifth pick on down, it was a question of taking a player and a chance.</p>
        <p>As expected, the Orlando Magic took Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1-inch, 294-pound center from Louisiana State, while 6-10 Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning went to the Charlotte Hornets, 6-11 Duke forward Christian Laettner to the Minnesota Timberwolves and 6-6 Ohio State swingman Jim Jackson to the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
        <p>Before they even announced their pick, the Mavericks made room for Jackson in their starting lineup by unloading $2 million-a-year, 33-year-old shooting guard Rolando Blackman to the Knicks, in exchange for the Knicks' first-round draft pick in 1995.</p>
        <p>With Blackman in tow, the Knicks later drafted University of North Carolina shooting guard Hubert Davis with the 20th pick, effectively ending the seven-year Knick career of restricted free agent Gerald Wilkins.</p>
        <p>The Nets, with two second-round selections, picked 6-11 power forward P. J. Brown of Louisiana Tech and 6-5 shooting guard Steve Rogers of Alabama State who averaged 28.8 points a game over three seasons. Picking one spot behind the Knicks in the first round, the Boston Celtics chose Rick Barry's son, Jon, a 6-5 guard from Georgia Tech.</p>
        <p>In other deals, Utah traded forward Blue Edwards, guard Eric Murdock and the 23d pick of tonight's first round for Milwaukee forward Larry Krystkowiak and guard Jay Humphries. After drafting U.C.L.A.'s Don MacLean with the 19th pick, the Detroit Pistons packaged his rights with center William Bedford to the Los Angeles Clippers for center Olden Polynice and the Clippers' second-round picks in 1996 and 1997.</p>
        <p>St. John's Malik Sealy, the school's No. 2 all-time scorer, went 14th to the Indiana Pacers, setting up immediate speculation that the Pacers would trade Chuck Person, their trash-talking scoring forward.</p>
        <p>"I do all my talking with the basketball," said the quiet 6-8 Sealy, who grew up in the Bronx and was a star at the now-defunct Tolentine High School.</p>
        <p>"I sort of had the feeling that Indiana would draft me," Sealy said. "They play a wide-open offense, which is good for me. In college, I had to adjust to a slower style."</p>
        <p>Every team drafting below Dallas in the first round had to wrestle with a choice of several prospects of various sizes -- all bringing their own set of pros and cons. "It's the deepest draft in years," said an N.B.A. college scout, Marty Blake. "But you have better done your homework on some of these guys."</p>
        <p>With the first of two picks, Denver picked Notre Dame power forward LaPhonso Ellis at No. 5, and Ellis promptly demonstrated why the Nuggets fell in love with him when he visited Denver.</p>
        <p>"I've made it quite clear to my agent that I want to be in the league quite a while, and to do that, I have to be in camp," said the 6-8 Ellis. "I'm not one to quibble over dollars."</p>
        <p>Washington's choice at No. 6, North Carolina State's Tom Gugliotta, had no complaints about being drafted by the lowly Bullets. The 6-10 multiskilled forward, who grew up a Knicks fan in Huntington Station, L.I., saw his stock rise dramatically as a senior, and was thrilled to go in the top 10.</p>
        <p>"I've been going to the N.B.A. draft in New York since I was 12 years old, taking the train in and waiting on line," he said. "This is almost hard to believe."</p>
        <p>While Gugliotta's stock rose, U.S.C.'s Harold Miner, at one point considered a top 6 pick, dropped to the Miami Heat at No. 12, after Sacramento took 6-8 Maryland guard Walt Williams seventh, Milwaukee grabbed Arkansas' 6-8 forward Todd Day eighth, Philadelphia went for Southern Mississippi's Charles Barkley wanna-be, scoring forward Clarence Weatherspoon at No. 9 and Atlanta took Stanford banger Adam Keefe at No. 10. Day was one of three Arkansas players chosen in the first round, with Phoenix taking Oliver Miller 22d and Milwaukee also grabbing Arkansas point guard Lee Mayberry at 23. 76ers Can Only Hope</p>
        <p>Like Barkley, who was traded to Phoenix last week, there are questions about Weatherspoon's weight and size. He said he is a shade over 6-6, the N.B.A. lists him at 6-5 and some believe he's smaller than that. In fact, when Weatherspoon was departing Philadelphia last week after a visit with the 76ers, he bumped into Barkley, of all people, at the airport, with television cameras recording their brief discussion. The 6-4 Barkley was said to look taller.</p>
        <p>"Angles and photos," Weatherspoon said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>The 76ers are hoping for the kind of results they got from Sir Charles. Also crossing their fingers are the Los Angeles Lakers, who gambled on Missouri's troubled but explosive scoring guard, Anthony Peeler, who has twice been accused of assaulting a woman, once with a gun, in the last two weeks.</p>
        <p>While Ellis may be looking to sign quickly, Orlando faces a far more daunting task. The Magic may have until July 1 to strike a deal with O'Neal's agent, the Los Angeles-based Leonard Armato if they want to keep their young nucleus of talent together.</p>
        <p>That's because 7-foot center Stanley Roberts, a Magic rookie in 1991-92 and ironically a former O'Neal teammate at L.S.U., becomes a restricted free agent on July 1. Several teams, including their instra-state rival Miami Heat, have expressed strong interest in Roberts, a talented player whose biggest problem in the past has been his appetite.</p>
        <p>If one of those teams was to sign Roberts to an offer sheet with a heavy payload in the first year of the contract, Orlando would not be able to match and still hope to fit O'Neal, whose demands are said to be running as high as $6 million-a-year over the length of a long-term deal, into the cap. With O'Neal signed before July 1, the Magic would be in position to match any offer to Roberts.</p>
