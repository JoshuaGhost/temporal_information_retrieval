        <p>Is this the needle that bursts the Perot bubble? Can the undeclared independent candidate keep his remarkable drive toward the White House on course amid a storm of charges that his agents have spied on President Bush, members of the President's family and even his own children?</p>
        <p>Those questions were the talk of political Washington last night and today.  Republicans and Democrats alike chattered about "Inspector Perot" and his comeuppance, though they pictured the Dallas billionaire turned populist politician as a more sinister figure than Peter Sellers' screen gumshoe.</p>
        <p>Few politicians, here or elsewhere, believe that the damage to Mr. Perot is fatal, at least so far, but one thing is evident to all: For the first time, after weeks of success, he has been forced onto the defensive. His managers had been trying to keep him under wraps to give him time to master complex issues with which he has limited familiarity, but the new round of attacks forced them, as one said, "to get him out front now, hitting back hard."</p>
        <p>Failure to do so, they were convinced, would have cost Mr. Perot very dearly, so they pulled out all the stops -- appearances on early morning television, in a full-scale news conference, on the "Larry King Show." Perot Plays Defense</p>
        <p>He scored points in his counterattack on the "Today" program, politicians said, especially by displaying a copy of a sentimental letter from George Bush thanking him for his concern about the Bush family. But most of his 40 minutes of precious national air time was spent playing defense, when what he likes to do is spray accusations at the status quo and Washington insiders.</p>
        <p>"I thought he cut Bush badly with that letter," said John C. White, a former Democratic national chairman.  "But on balance, he's hurt as much as Bush. Meanwhile, Clinton gets a chance to talk issues while they're staging a Texas shootout. Our guy's not exactly the darling of the voters, but if they keep at this, he may be the only one left standing, which is probably the only way that he can win this."</p>
        <p>Asked whether he thought the spying issue was enough to destroy the Perot candidacy, Rich Bond, the Republican chairman, replied that it was "just a beginning," but he added, "I think it's a hell of a start."</p>
        <p>Larry Bartels, a professor of politics at Princeton, said that he saw "no smoking gun in this issue yet." The spying charges are far more likely to "add to an accumulation of doubts about Perot among voters -- lots of different questions for lots of different people -- that will lead to the 'wasted vote' syndrome setting in about the middle or end of October." Countering an Image</p>
        <p>What the Perot forces fear is that an unflattering image of their man is taking hold -- an image as "a secretive computer salesman with a penchant for skulduggery," to use the phrase of Bob Martinez, the former governor of Florida who is now Mr. Bush's point man in the campaign against drugs.</p>
        <p>To escape the trap, Mr. Perot is following a three-pronged strategy:</p>
        <p>First, he is denying everything, which, as Mr. Bartels noted, offers a hostage to fortune; if he is caught lying, his image as the straight-shooting cowboy determined to drive the cheats and liars out of town would be ruined.</p>
        <p>Second, he is equating the news media that have been printing the charges with mainstream politicians, "putting 'em all in the same bag," as George C. Wallace used to say, and blaming the mess in Washington on all of them. It is another version of Vice President Dan Quayle's anti-elite strategy.</p>
        <p>Third, he has been blaming the attacks on "Republican dirty tricks," in an obvious attempt to evoke memories of the Watergate break-in, whose 20th anniversary has put it back in the news lately. Mr. Bond freely admits that Republican campaign workers have passed information damaging to Mr. Perot to reporters, but he denied in an interview that such conduct constituted "dirty tricks" and said that the Democrats had been doing exactly the same thing. Taking Perot Seriously</p>
        <p>Much will depend on whether there is more to come. Clearly, the White House takes the Texan seriously enough to mount a concerted and continuing offensive, with Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's press secretary, risking charges of overkill with the comment, "Ross Perot's paranoia knows no bounds."</p>
        <p>In addition, Washington reporters are working on hundreds of leads relating to Mr. Perot's past activities, much as they did during Mr. Clinton's time of troubles early this year. If their investigations result in an avalanche of believable articles, it could well bury Mr. Perot's political future.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere has changed. For weeks, allegations about Mr. Perot's business practices and behind-the-scenes political operations were printed and broadcast daily, and no one paid attention. Now they are taking hold.</p>
        <p>Ann Lewis, a Democratic campaign consultant, compared the Perot campaign to the 1990 gubernatorial campaign of John Silber, a conservative Democrat who is the president of Boston University.</p>
        <p>"Silber was an authoritarian, can-do political outsider, just like Perot," Ms. Lewis said. "He fit perfectly with the bubbling frustration of the electorate. There was plenty of negative information around from the start, but it had no impact. When it finally connected, right at the end, Silber was finished. Perot will be tougher, but in the end it will wear him down, too."  THE 1992 CAMPAIGN</p>
