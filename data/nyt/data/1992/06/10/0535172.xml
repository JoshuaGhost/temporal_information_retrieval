        <p>As a China scholar who got into the field with a certain love for the society I was studying, I am saddened by "China's Rights Abuses Reflect a Bitter History," Robert Bernstein's May 19 letter railing against China's "gross" abuses. "Put the Squeeze on Beijing" by Holly Burkhalter (Op-Ed, May 25) goes so far as to suggest an executive branch human rights policy of manipulating internal Chinese affairs by means of selective economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>Why China in particular? What a preposterous and hypocritical abuse of United States power it would be to re-enact the intrusiveness of the age of imperialism to impose our ideas and ideals on a country with a historic memory of an earlier international assault on its integrity.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a China scholar who got into the field with a certain love for the society I was studying, I am saddened by "China's Rights Abuses Reflect a Bitter History," Robert Bernstein's May 19 letter railing against China's "gross" abuses. "Put the Squeeze on Beijing" by Holly Burkhalter (Op-Ed, May 25) goes so far as to suggest an executive branch human rights policy of manipulating internal Chinese affairs by means of selective economic sanctions.</p>
        <p>Why China in particular? What a preposterous and hypocritical abuse of United States power it would be to re-enact the intrusiveness of the age of imperialism to impose our ideas and ideals on a country with a historic memory of an earlier international assault on its integrity.</p>
        <p>Appalling as China's human rights abuses might seem, they do not warrant such drama. We should pay as much attention to others or, better still, to ourselves. Globally speaking, from Thailand to Nigeria to the United States, people are rioting to vent frustrations related to economic, democratic and civil rights.</p>
        <p>Today, China's entrepreneurial (or material) spirit and enlightened expressiveness are not counterpoised in some sort of dialectical contradiction. They are at a crossroads. And I think that they will find one another quite naturally, as in China's past, through the impetus of economic development and the will of the younger generation. Without excessive external pressure, the synthesis of energies is likely to lead to strident reform, rather than combustion.</p>
        <p>The youth of China have a psychological tradition of deference to their elders, but they have learned how to stand up and speak as well. Chinese youths began as a vanguard of social change with the May 4 Movement in the first quarter of the century, and this momentum carried into a revolution. They resumed at intervals through the Cultural Revolution and into the more recent quests for a Chinese democracy.</p>
        <p>Economically and socially, China is making strides forward at its own pace. Its future is in the hands of the younger generations and protagonists for economic and political reform in positions of authority.</p>
        <p>Pushing China further along is a worthy and idealistic endeavor. But when push comes to shove, we are being unjust to a country that has a right to preserve its own way of coping. DAVID M. RADDOCK Brooklyn, May 25, 1992 The writer is the author of "Political Behavior of Adolescents in China."</p>
