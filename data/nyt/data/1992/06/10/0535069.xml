        <p>A plan to build New York City's first biomedical research complex was upheld yesterday by a state appeals court over the opposition of a coalition that contended it posed a health threat to the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Initially, much of the opposition of the Save the Audubon Coalition had centered on the proposed destruction of the Audubon Theater and Ballroom, which many New Yorkers regard as a memorial to Malcolm X, who was assassinated there in 1965.</p>
        <p>But the project, the Audubon Research Park, was changed to preserve the historically significant portions of the theater and ballroom, including their facades, and to create a community center and a memorial to Malcolm X. As a result, the court said the only issue for it to resolve were charges that the research center portion of the project posed a health and environmental hazard. Response by Opponent</p>
        <p>Kenneth D. Schaeffer, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Right, which represented the coalition, said coalition members were "not happy" that the theater and ballroom would not be totally preserved, but he said he did not know if the coalition would seek to block the project on that ground. Telephone calls to several coalition members went unanswered yesterday.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous decision, a five-member panel of the the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court for the First Department affirmed a lower court ruling that the research center did not pose a health or environmental threat. The court said that the coalition's arguments that the complex posed a health hazard were based on outdated information, adding that health and environmental agencies, including the City Health Department, had reviewed the project and found no evidence of any immediate public-health risks.</p>
        <p>Mathew J. Cachere, another lawyer for the Constitutional Right center, said he would have to review the decision before deciding whether to request permission to appeal. Because the panel's ruling was unanimous, the coalition would have to receive the court's permission to appeal its ruling to the State Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>If there is no appeal, initial construction of the $27.8 six-floor Audubon Research Building could begin. It would be the first of five similar buildings that would be included in a four-block, triangular complex bounded by Audubon Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenues and West 165th and 168th Streets in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>The project, which would be part of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center at Broadway and 168th Street, is sponsored jointly by Columbia University, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Columbia envisions that the entire complex, which will be built at a cost more than $100 million, will eventually include more than 700,000 square feet of research space and employ more than 2,000 people.</p>
        <p>Martin E. Gold, a lawyer for Columbia's Board of Trustees, said he was delighted with the ruling.</p>
