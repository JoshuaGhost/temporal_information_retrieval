        <p>Ian Davenport  Paul Kasmin Gallery 580 Broadway, at Prince Street SoHo Through June 27</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old British painter Ian Davenport is receiving a lot of attention in his own country. Just two years out of art school, he was given a one-man show at the Waddington Galleries in London, and his approach to abstraction has been greeted in some quarters of the press as an esthetic breakthrough.</p>
        <p>He works with monochromatic household paint that he pours onto a vertical canvas. The initial applications seem to be made at measured intervals from the canvas's top edge to set up a basic pattern, allowing gravity to take over once the paint begins to flow down. The technique, almost identical to that of Morris Louis's stained paintings of the 1960's, seems motivated by the similar intention of creating an organic but nonexpressionistic abstract art.</p>

        <p>Ian Davenport  Paul Kasmin Gallery 580 Broadway, at Prince Street SoHo Through June 27</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old British painter Ian Davenport is receiving a lot of attention in his own country. Just two years out of art school, he was given a one-man show at the Waddington Galleries in London, and his approach to abstraction has been greeted in some quarters of the press as an esthetic breakthrough.</p>
        <p>He works with monochromatic household paint that he pours onto a vertical canvas. The initial applications seem to be made at measured intervals from the canvas's top edge to set up a basic pattern, allowing gravity to take over once the paint begins to flow down. The technique, almost identical to that of Morris Louis's stained paintings of the 1960's, seems motivated by the similar intention of creating an organic but nonexpressionistic abstract art.</p>
        <p>Where Louis relied on rivulets of color for his variety, however, Mr. Davenport relies on subtleties of surface texture. From the distance of a few feet, all the paintings in the show appear to present a tonally modulated gray field. Only with close-up viewing does the rhythmic design of the flowing paint reveal itself as shiny arcs of emulsion standing out against a matte ground.</p>
        <p>Little in Mr. Davenport's painting is exactly new. This is basically old-fashioned formalist work updated with lots of art-historical references (Color Field, Minimalism and Abstract Expressionism coming into play). The results are literate and extremely elegant -- qualities that will probably carry them a long way -- but they also have a feeling of calculation and conceptual closure that is somewhat disheartening to see in so young an artist.</p>
