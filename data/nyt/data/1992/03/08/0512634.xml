        <p>IT wasn't as if the Yankees shouldn't have known.

        <p>IT wasn't as if the Yankees shouldn't have known. Long before George Steinbrenner, then in power as the principal owner, agreed to sign Pascual Perez to a three-year, $5.7 million contract, enough warnings had been posted. As if they were highway signs for "speed zone" or "construction, slow."</p>
        <p>In 1984, Perez served three months in a Dominican Republic prison after a conviction for cocaine possession.</p>
        <p>In 1989, the right-handed pitcher missed all of spring training with the Montreal Expos while in a drug-rehab center.</p>
        <p>In 1990, after Perez arrived seven days late for his first spring training with the Yankees because of what he described as "visa problems," the Expos manager then, Buck Rodgers, described Perez as a "time bomb that the Yankees will have to monitor closely." In his third start that season, Perez departed with an ailing arm that required rotator-cuff surgery that August.</p>
        <p>Again last year, Perez showed up late for spring training with the Yankees. Ten days late. Visa problems. This year he reported five days later than scheduled, but glowed that it was "beautiful" to be with his 26-year-old brother, Melido, a right-handed pitcher obtained from the Chicago White Sox in the off-season trade for second baseman Steve Sax.</p>
        <p>"Even at home, we never played together, not even catch," Pascual said. "Now we're together."</p>
        <p>But now, 34-year-old Pascual Perez is no longer together with his brother, the Yankees, or baseball. He has been suspended for one year by Commissioner Fay Vincent for having failed a drug test taken Feb. 26, the day he reported.</p>
        <p>The "time bomb" finally exploded -- the time bomb the Yankees knew was ticking, but didn't hear in the off season.</p>
        <p>Pascual Perez's problem is his weakness, his illness. What happened is his fault, not the Yankees' fault. And it's not as if the Yankees didn't try at all. From spring training until the season ended, General Manager Gene Michael contended that the Yankees had "a guy who goes with him," who drives him around, who gets him places on time, who keeps him away from the wrong places.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Doc Ellis, once a Yankee pitcher turned drug counselor, was around him; last year, Cesar Presbott baby-sat him.</p>
        <p>"But once Pascual goes home to the Dominican for the off season," Michaels was saying, "there's not much you can do."</p>
        <p>Wrong. If you invest $5.7 million, you invest more than dozens of unanswered phone messages in the off season; you go to San Cristobal yourself or you send somebody to check him out. If you invest $5.7 million, you invest more than a request that he pitch in the Winter League to strengthen his arm after a two-year record of 3-6; you make sure he pitches.</p>
        <p>Asked how much drug-related support the Yankees provided Pascual over the last two years, Michael bristled.</p>
        <p>"I could ask the same question: How much did the commissioner's office do? How much did his agent do?" the general manager said, alluding to Tom Reich. "How much did the Players Association do?"</p>
        <p>But the question lingers: since Perez was a Yankee pitcher, how much did the Yankees do?</p>
        <p>Unlike the Mets, whose Dr. Alan Lans has supervised their employee-assistance plan for several years, the Yankees don't have a resident shrink. Although the Yankees have what they call an "affiliaton" with the Smithers Institute, none of their players have ever been known publicly to have spent any time there, as both Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry of the Mets did.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have also asked for trouble by pursuing players with a drug-related history, notably Steve Howe, the relief pitcher now facing a cocaine-related trial in Montana. In other years, the Yankees acquired three players who had been disciplined by baseball for their involvement in the 1985 drug trial in Pittsburgh: Claudell Washington, Rod Scurry and Dale Berra.</p>
        <p>But anybody familiar with Perez's past could ask the basic question: Why did the Yankees even consider signing him?</p>
        <p>"He had a good arm," said Michael, then a Yankee scout who would succeed Harding (Pete) Peterson as general manager around the time of Perez's rotator-cuff surgery. "People thought he could help us."</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Pascual Perez couldn't help himself. But the Yankees could have done more to help him. And themselves.</p>
