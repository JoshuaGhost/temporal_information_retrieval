        <p>Carol Sanford's problem with her teen-age daughter's telephone use was not the common one. Mrs. Sanford, of Jupiter, Fla., actually wanted her daughter, Jill, to spend more time on the phone, but Jill is deaf. Though her daughter could speak on the phone to her friends, Mrs. Sanford had to repeat the friends' responses so her daughter could lip-read.</p>
        <p>So Mrs. Sanford, a software engineer for the Photoelectrics Corporation, designed a device that allows Jill to see messages typed by her friends on their touch-tone phones. The size of a pocket calculator, the device displays the message as the touch-tone signals are picked up through a small suction cup that can be affixed to any phone. The person sending the message uses a two-button code for each letter of the alphabet.</p>

        <p>Carol Sanford's problem with her teen-age daughter's telephone use was not the common one. Mrs. Sanford, of Jupiter, Fla., actually wanted her daughter, Jill, to spend more time on the phone, but Jill is deaf. Though her daughter could speak on the phone to her friends, Mrs. Sanford had to repeat the friends' responses so her daughter could lip-read.</p>
        <p>So Mrs. Sanford, a software engineer for the Photoelectrics Corporation, designed a device that allows Jill to see messages typed by her friends on their touch-tone phones. The size of a pocket calculator, the device displays the message as the touch-tone signals are picked up through a small suction cup that can be affixed to any phone. The person sending the message uses a two-button code for each letter of the alphabet.</p>
        <p>"Now, I come home and find her on the phone, talking to her friends," Mrs. Sanford said in an interview. Search for New Technology</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sanford is among 800 inventors who responded to a national search for new technology to accommodate disabled people at home and at work.</p>
        <p>The need for such technology, to enable the physically handicapped to use computers, telephones and other basic equipment at a reasonable cost, has become especially pressing now that the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 has taken effect. It forbids discrimination in hiring and requires employers to accommodate the disabled in the workplace.</p>
        <p>Ranging from basement tinkerers to Ph.D. engineers, the 30 finalists in the contest sponsored by Johns Hopkins University, MCI Communications and the National Science Foundation, gathered in Washington in February to see their inventions on display at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
        <p>They represent an energetic group and included one third-grader, Jonathon Viventi of Mount Arlington, N.J.  He submitted a design for a computerized lawn mower that would cut the grass by itself.  Computer Aids</p>
        <p>The winner of this year's $10,000 first prize was Arjan Khsala, a computer engineer from Richmond, Calif. He submitted his Unicorn Smart Keyboard for computer users who have trouble manipulating a standard keyboard. His keyboard, which has large, wide keys, can be used with I.B.M. and Apple computers and can be adapted for children or for businesses that want a system that requires little training.</p>
        <p>Other winning entries included a software system designed by Frank McKiel of Trophy Club, Tex. It generates speech and sound to help a blind user manipulate a computer's rotary control, or mouse.</p>
        <p>In the far-flung network of independent inventors and small-scale companies that develop products in this specialized field, Paul Hazan has become the unofficial center. Mr. Hazan, the associate director for advanced computing at Johns Hopkins, organized the first Hopkins Search in 1981. 'Wonderful Chemistry'</p>
        <p>"It was like throwing a match on a bomb," Mr. Hazan said in describing the response to the first contest.</p>
        <p>"When get people together that are innovative and committed, it produces a wonderful chemistry," he said. "Once you get into this field, you don't get out." A decade after the first search, Mr. Hazan, who is not disabled, remains involved as program director.</p>
        <p>Many of the contestants from the first search, in fact, are now in the front line of research and development of technology for the disabled, Mr. Hazan said.</p>
        <p>Mark Friedman of Pittsburgh is one who of those who have started their own companies. Mr. Friedman's Eyetracker Communication System allows severely disabled people to communicate with computers by using eye movements. The company he helped found, Sentient Systems Technology, has continued to refine the technology. Other winners in the first contest included technology that used voice-activated commands to turn on appliances. Advice on Selling Inventions</p>
        <p>Though creative technology for the disabled should get a boost from the Americans with Disabilities Act, technology geared specifically for the disabled remains prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>Large companies that have given grants for the development of products for the disabled have been reluctant to get directly involved with the research because the limited market is perceived as unprofitable.</p>
        <p>This year's contestants spent two days in workshops getting advice on how to produce and market their inventions and concepts, including how to maneuver through a complicated licensing process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khsala said solutions that appeal to the widest possible market are the keys to creating marketable and affordable technology for the disabled.</p>
        <p>For example, he said: "The ramps they cut into the curbs in the sidewalk aren't just used by people in wheelchairs. They are used by mothers with strollers, bike riders and people making deliveries."</p>
        <p>Descriptions of the 100 best entries to this year's contest can be obtained by writing to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer's Computer Society Press, 10662 Los Vaqueros Circle, Los Alamitos, Calif. 90720.</p>
