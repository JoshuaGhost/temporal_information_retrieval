        <p>A SUPERIOR COURT judge's ruling has jeopardized Rhode Island's efforts to buy land for open-space preservation in at least 10 locations.</p>
        <p>Judge Alice Gibney's decision came in a controversial case known as Black Point. At issue are 44 acres of waterfront property in Narragansett bought by Ocean Road Partners, a development group, in 1984. It paid $2.4 million for those 44 acres and 23 acres across the street.</p>
        <p>The developers plan to build 80 condominium units on the 44-acre site. But environmental groups and advocates of waterfront access protested the development and the state's Attorney General, James E. O'Neill, took their side.</p>
        <p>In June 1989, Mr. O'Neill appealed a decision by the state's Coastal Resources Management Council, which had approved the development.</p>
        <p>Then, on July 7, 1989, Governor Edward D. DiPrete, condemned the 44 acres, announcing plans to create a waterfront park. The governor's action rendered Mr. O'Neill's appeal moot. Mr. DiPrete was running for re-election at the time.</p>
        <p>The state offered the developers $6.4 million for the property, but they filed suit in an appeals process.</p>
        <p>The state based its offer on an appraisal that said the highest and best use of the land was one-family house lots. The appraiser who made that determination, Thomas McLaughlin, noted that the condominium market had been souring for some time and by 1989 had all but collapsed.</p>
        <p>But an appraiser for the developers, William Coyle Jr., said a market still existed for luxury condominiums in Rhode Island and in their appeal, the developers argued that the value of Black Point was really $15.5 million.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 4, Judge Gibney sided with the developers. She ordered the state to pay them $15.5 million, plus interest, bringing the total to over $18 million.</p>
        <p>The state has appealed to Rhode Island's Supreme Court, which has agreed to hear the case. If Judge Gibney's decision is upheld, state officials have said the $16 million in the state's open space bond fund would be wiped out.</p>
        <p>Pending the outcome of the appeal, 10 open-space projects have been put on hold. "We're really at a standstill," said Judith Benedict, chief of the Division of Planning and Development in the state's Department of Environmental Management.</p>
