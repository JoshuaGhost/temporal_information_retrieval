        <p>MR. MANI</p>
        <p>By A. B. Yehoshua. Translated by Hillel Halkin. 369 pp. New York: Doubleday. $22.50.</p>
        <p>LIKE Amos Oz and Aharon Appelfeld, A. B. Yehoshua belongs to that generation of Israeli writers who came of age in the years following the 1948 war of independence. In a fiercely wrought sequence of stories, novels and plays, he has attempted nothing less than a sustained critique of Israeli society. His latest novel, "Mr. Mani," spirals in upon the origin of Israel's current malaise, offering a kaleidoscopic view of Jewish history filtered through the events of one family.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Mani" slips backward in time, as if through geological layers, from 1982 to the mid-18th century. Mr. Yehoshua traces the Manis through six generations of exile and periodic return, and their story is, I suspect, meant to represent the fate of the Jews as a whole in their epic struggle for identity.</p>
        <p>Translated from the Hebrew into crisp English prose by Hillel Halkin, "Mr. Mani" recalls two of Mr. Yehoshua's previous novels, "The Lover" (1978) and "A Late Divorce" (1984). Both are composed of interior monologues in which different speakers comment upon the continuing action; the narrative line thus becomes cyclical, while a reality is conjured that feels disjunctive, atemporal and radically subjective. In "Mr. Mani," the author has extended this technique, fashioning a novel from five "conversations" in which only one voice is heard. The effect (literal in the first conversation) is that of listening to someone talking on a telephone in the next room. One hears only the single voice, with all its interjections, perorations and ellipses. By the end of each conversation, however, the reader feels intimately familiar with both the speaker and the unheard listener. The unheard parties are, in fact, brilliantly invoked, while the drama of each conversation is ingeniously maintained.</p>
        <p>The disaffection of the younger generation of Israelis finds embodiment in Hagar Shiloh, the first speaker, who telephones her mother on New Year's Eve, 1982. She relays a chilling encounter with the father of her lover, Efrayim Mani, who is fighting in Lebanon. Efrayim's father, Gavriel Mani -- or "Mr. Mani" -- is a judge in Jerusalem, and Hagar tells how she burst in upon him just as he was about to hang himself. She stuck close to him for several days, hoping to prevent the suicide. Their evolving (and obsessive) relationship becomes apparent as the conversation proceeds, and Hagar's mother's response is not difficult to reconstruct from her daughter's testy responses:</p>
        <p>"-- It was not a figment of my imagination.</p>
        <p>"-- Because I saw it.</p>
        <p>"-- I know exactly what I saw . . .</p>
        <p>"-- But just wait a minute. Why can't you have a little patience?</p>
        <p>"-- So what? We have all night.</p>
        <p>"-- But you agreed to skip the New Year's Eve party.</p>
        <p>"-- Then what are you so tense about?"</p>
        <p>And so on. The dark and labyrinthine ways of Mr. Mani's mind are plumbed obliquely, while Hagar's own psyche is exposed in all its jejune splendor. Though she grew up on a kibbutz, she is no kibbutznik; indeed, she is selfish, confused and utterly devoid of the idealism that defined her mother's generation. She is also terribly fragile, a moth drawn to the flame of Mr. Mani's self-immolating soul.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yehoshua wisely includes short biographical sketches at the outset and close of each of the one-sided conversations, giving resonance to what is heard. Indeed, these supplements are quite wonderful in themselves, rich in detail and psychological depth. They fill in the tragic history of the Mani family with a laconic simplicity that contrasts with the compulsive garrulousness of the five speakers, who are constantly saying to their conversational partners things like: Am I boring you? Please, let me continue! Don't fall asleep! Are you listening? You must let me finish my story!</p>
        <p>Indeed, the five speakers -- though radically different -- have much in common. They are all in a position of subservience to the people they are addressing, and their rhetoric is consequently supplicating (and self-justifying) as well as evasive. Each story involves an encounter with the mysterious Mani family, and each signals a phase in the larger story of Diaspora that forms a subtext to the novel.</p>
        <p>The second speaker is the only gentile we hear; a young German soldier in Crete during World War II addresses his powerful "grandmother" (who is really his father's wife but no blood relative). He has come into painful contact with a gentleman called Mr. Yosef Mani, who, it seems, has been a tour guide to the ancient ruins of Cretan civilization. Mr. Mani and his family quickly become an obsession with the younger soldier, who has literally dropped (by parachute) onto the island as an official representative of Hitlerian anti-Semitism. Through his identification with Yosef Mani, and through his inward questioning of the German war mentality, he becomes -- in effect -- a type of Jew himself. Mr. Yehoshua suggests, I think, that anyone who resists authority of a certain kind is a "Jew," and therefore the traditional definitions of Jewishness must be reconsidered.</p>
        <p>In the third conversation, a young British officer called Ivor Horowitz, in Palestine on assignment in 1918, addresses a senior officer. His obsequiousness is unnerving as he attempts to get his superior, a military judge, to pardon Yosef Mani, who has been condemned to hang for passing British documents to the Turkish enemy. This incarnation of Mr. Mani is the most attractive and elusive of them all, a younger version of the same protean creature who reappears in Crete 20 years later as a guide to the ancient labyrinth.</p>
        <p>MY favorite conversationalist is Efrayim Shapiro, the 29-year-old doctor who addresses his wealthy father, Sholom Shapiro, in Poland in 1899 in the fourth section of "Mr. Mani." Having returned from a Zionist conference in Switzerland that he attended with his sister, Linka, Dr. Shapiro tells about some astonishing encounters; he met Theodor Herzl, for instance, the father of the modern Zionist movement. He also met Moshe Mani, a hyperactive obstetrician from Jerusalem who (despite already having wife and children) fell pathetically in love with Linka. Dr. Mani managed to lure Dr. Shapiro and his sister back to Jerusalem for a fateful visit, and his death, by suicide, prefigures other suicides or near-suicides in the Mani line.</p>
        <p>The final conversation becomes a rich meditation on familial origins and original sin. The speaker is Avraham Mani, who was born in 1799 in Salonika, then part of the Turkish Empire. His own father, Yosef Mani, was a successful cavalry supplier, like his father. And so on, Mani after Mani recedes through history -- an endless hall of mirrors that reaches back to the origins of time.</p>
        <p>Avraham was sent to live and study with a legendary rabbi in Constantinople, and in this chapter, set in Athens in 1848, he has come to the now dying rabbi's bedside to confess a hideous sin that may well taint the Mani family for generations to come. The conversation ends, bizarrely, with Avraham locking the sick man's bedroom door to confess his crime. "It was hardly surprising," writes Mr. Yehoshua in the biographical supplement that follows, "that the Jews who broke down the locked door and found Mr. Mani dancing and singing before a naked corpse that he was trying to revive were extremely angry at him, even though they never doubted he meant well."</p>
        <p>A strain of madness taints the gradually emerging figure of the eternal Mani evinced in the richly textured palimpsest of the novel. As a type of Wandering Jew, the protean hero of "Mr. Mani" compels us to admire him. He is resourceful, evasive, charming, antic and proud. Through this figure, Mr. Yehoshua invokes the Diaspora in all its tragic and absurd dimensions. SIX GENERATIONS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR</p>
        <p>A. B. Yehoshua calls his new novel, "Mr. Mani," an "intergenerational psychoanalysis." "I wanted to understand the present by digging through the layers of the past," the 55-year-old novelist said of the book, which traces six generations of an Israeli family. "It takes a lot of imagination to identify with faraway times and places. I was trying to make the reader get more involved."</p>
        <p>Speaking by telephone from his home in Haifa, Israel, Mr. Yehoshua said he intended his fictional Mani family to represent "the other side of Jewish history," before the creation of the state of Israel. "There are those who were attached to the land before there was ever the idea of coming back, and whose relation to the Arabs was more natural," said Mr. Yehoshua, whose family has lived in what is now Israel for five generations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yehoshua, who teaches literature at Haifa University, said he hopes that the crossroads at which his characters find themselves at different points in the past will be illuminating for the decision makers of today.</p>
        <p>"We are at a crossroads now between war and peace," he observed. "And in 10 years, people will judge us for what we have chosen."
