        <p>WE were picking our way along a narrow trail cut into a mountain slope when we heard a merry jingling and shouts of laughter. Scrambling off the trail, we stared in wonder as a group of Zanskaris galloped past on their ponies. It was a wedding party, carrying the bride to her new husband's village. The little Zanskari horses were hung with bells and brightly colored, folded rugs were strapped onto their backs. On these the guests rode in their finery -- maroon robes with pink sashes, multipointed gold caps on the lamas. One woman wore a headdress festooned with turquoises, while the bride was half-enveloped by a big white cloth draped over her and tied at the waist. As they rode by, they waved and cheered at us, and some leaned over, superb riders that they are, reached out and gave us a quick handshake without stopping their horses.</p>
        <p>My husband, Philip, and I were part of a group of 10 trekking across Zanskar into Ladakh, two ancient Himalayan kingdoms that are now part of India.

        <p>My husband, Philip, and I were part of a group of 10 trekking across Zanskar into Ladakh, two ancient Himalayan kingdoms that are now part of India. The area is known, however, as Little Tibet, for this high, remote, sparsely populated area lies at the western edge of the Tibetan plateau, to which it is attached geographically and culturally. Since the destruction of most of the great monasteries across the border, Tibetan culture is said to survive most authentically in Zanskar and Ladakh, whose inhabitants practice Tibetan Buddhism and speak a language related to Tibetan.</p>
        <p>Our three-week trek last August was organized by Wilderness Travel. Trekking in Zanskar and Ladakh is one of the most rigorous and demanding ventures in the world. Most of our hiking and camping was done above 13,000 feet. The daily marches often take eight or nine hours, and there are many high passes to cross, sometimes two in one day. The trails, moreover, are very bad in places, with eroded passages sometimes barely a foot wide (I repeatedly blessed my trekking poles, as well as my excellent boots). Since these sections occur most often on traverses, 500 to 1,000 feet above a torrent, one must walk with great concentration. And cold, sometimes fast streams must occasionally be forded on foot.</p>
        <p>From Darcha, in northern India, we walked for several days through almost wholly uninhabited country, hedged in by snowy mountains on each side. Crossing the Great Himalaya range into Zanskar, we entered a strange new world. The country through which we walked for the next several weeks was wild, austerely beautiful and unspoiled, with villages far more primitive than most I had seen in visits to Nepal. The southern side of the mountains had been quite green but Zanskar and Ladakh, shielded from the monsoon, are a high-altitude desert.</p>
        <p>In the brilliant light, we saw an unfolding panorama of planes and surfaces, shadow and color: a sculptor's landscape. The light was a primary element of the landscape, beyond anything I had seen in the Alps, the Rockies, or even Nepal; it changed the tones of the color, brought out this slab or that rib, highlighted a fold or emphasized it with shadow. The bare land was a tablet, an empty sheet, on which were printed the changing forms of the clouds sailing overhead.</p>
        <p>As we stood on top of the Sirsir La, a 15,744-foot pass at the northern edge of the Zanskar range, we looked upon rippling folds of mountains, pale blond in the sun, blue in the shadow, tinged with subtle green where there was a light cover of vegetation. To the north were a group of orange rock spires, and, below us, a silver ribbon of river.</p>
        <p>Surprises were continual and the contrasts astonishing: one day we would hike through a broad, spacious valley with long vistas and snow-streaked mountains; on another, our path might lead through a deep gorge between sheer rock walls. The weather was equally variable: a warm, still day might be followed by a cool, windy one, a sunny morning by a cloudy afternoon. On a few occasions we hiked through rain, but much more often in the sun, sometimes in baking heat. Occasionally at night we could see distant glimmering flashes -- the lightning of the monsoon storms striking India far to the south.</p>
        <p>We traveled with a portable village, tents erected every night for us by the crew. The cook and his aides served us oatmeal and eggs for breakfast; after the supply of sliced toasting bread gave out, they made chapatis and other Indian breads, and sometimes gave us an Indian breakfast, with mildy spiced chickpeas. Lunch was more often a picnic box (sandwich, crackers and cookies, chocolate, and perhaps an apple or mango) than a cooked meal. Dinner was announced by our chief guide, who banged a spoon against a pot and called out "Soup ready!" This was followed by rice or potatoes, lentils or chickpeas, canned vegetables (as well as fresh salad, while supplies held out), and an occasional chicken or goat, bought at villages along the route. Dessert was canned fruit or pudding. We were given a bowl of warm water to wash in before breakfast; at several campsites we were also able to bathe in a river or stream. We were given boiled water at breakfast, at which point we would fill our water bottles for the day. Additional drinking water was carried by a crew member.</p>
        <p>Our companionable group included an interesting mix, from a recent college graduate of about 22 to a 61-year-old psychologist who was one of the strongest trekkers: training was a better predictor of a trekker's stamina than age. Several were in their 50's, including a businessman and an anesthesiologist.</p>
        <p>We came to our first Zanskari village the day after we entered Zanskar proper by crossing the great Shingo La, a pass 16,550 feet high, with a glacier on top. This was a long and tiring day, requiring some nine hours of walking. We did not reach our campsite until late afternoon, but the wild beauty of the scene burned through my fatigue. Our tents were set up on a grassy bank beside a river, the Kargiakh Chu, near the base of a glacier-topped peak. To the north stretched a long, deep valley cut below walls of buff and dark red rock, along which we would walk the next day toward the heart of Zanskar. The effect was of great openness and spaciousness.</p>
        <p>We began the next day by crossing the river on horseback. Unlike Nepal, where porters carry the loads, in Zanskar ponies are the bearers. For our group of trekkers, plus a crew of seven, there were 26 ponies and mules led by 6 "pony men." Two riding ponies were available, and several of us used them for a day or two, following minor illness. Zanskari ponies are ridden virtually bareback, usually with no stirrups or reins and just a folded rug or blanket in place of a saddle. The rider holds onto a fistful of the horse's mane or just grips the edge of the rug. Our ponies were led across the river, lurching slightly on its stony bottom. When all had reached the other bank, the animals were reloaded and we started off. Paljor, our Zanskari guide, led the group; Devendra Basnet, our trek leader, brought up the rear. In between these two we were spread out on foot, each trekking at our own pace.</p>
        <p>The valley of the Kargiakh Chu was filled with edelweiss, growing in profusion, amid houseleek and several other wildflowers. We saw many birds, including a lammergeier, a type of vulture with an enormous wingspan, that soared overhead. Devendra, a Nepali fluent in English, has a degree in zoology and a keen interest in wildlife; he often pointed out and identified birds and animals.</p>
        <p>We followed the riverbed all morning, between mountain slopes of orange-brown, rust and sometimes purple rock. Across the great, empty valley, a little cloud of dust sometimes appeared and soon we would see a horseman or two galloping along, as if in a scene from the Wild West. These Central Asian cowboys are dressed not in jeans but long robes with sashes around their waists, and their herds consist of yaks, or sometimes goats. Mostly, though, it seems that Zanskaris like to ride about whenever possible, sometimes two on one pony.</p>
        <p>Near midday we came upon a small group working beside a corral made of stones, their yaks resting nearby. Neat stacks of yak dung patties were piled up next to the corral, which the men were stuffing into huge sacks made of coarse brown and white striped wool. In this land without trees, animal dung is the main source of fuel. When in late afternoon we came upon their village, Kargiakh, it was visible from afar because of its fields; barley, the staple crop of Tibetans living at high altitude, is a fresh, vivid green -- one of the sudden, startling flashes of brilliant color we encountered in this predominantly tawny landscape.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, great bushes of wild roses, pink and red, grow everywhere, even where the country is very arid. An emerald stripe along a riverbed announces a village. The cube-shaped houses are often whitewashed; seen from a distance their shape and color vaguely resemble the houses of the Greek islands. These, however, are built of round stones dragged up from the rivers and of bricks made of mud and dung. Their flat roofs are used as work spaces, and seem to crackle with lively shapes -- prayer flags flap from poles tilted at rakish angles amid piles of drying grain, thatch made of brush and stacks of dung patties. Often, we would see villagers on their rooftops, heaping or binding grain or performing other tasks.</p>
        <p>In Kargiakh the word "hotel" was crudely painted on a mud wall; one of only two or three such notices that I saw in our three weeks of trekking. Curious, I entered and found a group of local men sitting in a dark room with mud walls and a dirt floor. Despite a small stove with a chimney pipe, the room was very smoky. Not only is lodging far scarcer and cruder than in Nepal, but other simple conveniences that trekkers in Nepal have come to depend on simply do not exist yet in Zanskar and Ladakh. The main trekking trails in Nepal are now well supplied with lodges and teahouses, rough though they are, and all but the more remote villages have small shops where trekkers can buy cookies, chocolate bars, matches, batteries and the like. In the interior of Zanskar and Ladakh I saw only one shop, and that one scarcely deserved the name.</p>
        <p>The villages are few and far between, and in our daily marches, generally averaging about 10 miles, we might pass two, one, or none at all. Gompas, which are both temples and monasteries, are found almost as often as villages, and whoever is not a farmer seems to be a monk (there are also nuns, though fewer of them). Gompas are often built high on the side of a hill or atop a promontory. Most dramatic of all is Phuktal; to reach it, we walked for two hours through a rock-walled gorge, along a very narrow (and in places very poor) trail cut into a steep slope above a torrent. Crossing a modern suspension bridge, we rounded a bend and saw the monastery: a vertical series of whitewashed buildings, one perched above another, set high into the wall of ocher, blue and gray rock.</p>
        <p>To enter a gompa is to pass from an austere, almost abstract landscape to a world of vivid color and fantasy. Nearly every surface is covered with wall paintings in which the numerous deities of the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon -- some blue, others red, yellow, green, black or white -- wave their multiple arms, dance, leap, clasp their partners and trample on their enemies, while the Buddhas themselves sit on their lotus blossoms, teaching or meditating. Everything is or once was in brilliant color, for the wall paintings are often defaced by damp or the smoke from butter lamps. In any case, sometimes the rooms can be dark, and we always carried headlamps and flashlights with us when visiting a gompa. Every gompa has a porch painted with the lords of the four quarters of the compass, dressed in tiger skins, armor or jewels, who wave swords and banners, play upon lutes and fend off evil spirits.</p>
        <p>It is a curious experience for a Westerner to travel through a country in which there are no shops but many monasteries. In the great, spacious, empty valleys of this country, we sometimes saw no more than three or four people in a whole day's walk. The greatest number we saw at any one time was at the gompas, where there are large complements of monks: 30 of them, seated cross-legged in a prayer hall (and chanting in chorus), constitute more Zanskaris or Ladakhis than you will see in nearly any village. At Lingshed Gompa, we found a group of monks sitting on the floor of the porch, listening to another monk who appeared to be expounding a lesson in theology.</p>
        <p>As we descended from the last pass, we could see tiny shapes creeping in the distance: truck traffic. We had reached Lamayuru, the great monastery overLooking the Indus Valley, the only part of Ladakh with a road. From there we were driven to the outskirts of Leh, a real town and the capital of Ladakh. We spent a couple of days visiting the string of grand monasteries along the Indus Valley: Shey, Tikse, Hemis, and Alchi, an 11th-century marvel. Though each was impressive, with some notable painting and statues, the experience was different, the monasteries affected by tourism and the modern world. The true feel of these ancient kingdoms lies rather in obscure mountain villages, populated by herdsmen and farmers, that remain much as they were hundreds of years ago and in the remote gompas of the interior, where a life of simple, undistracted spirituality flourishes in a spare, stark world. KEEP ON TREKKING Getting There</p>
        <p>The season for trekking in Ladakh and Zanskar is July through September.</p>
        <p>Wilderness Travel, 901 Allston Way, Berkeley, Calif. 94710, (800) 247-6700, is running its trek to the region this year from July 23 to Aug. 22. The cost: $3,190 per person for a group of from 10 to 15 people and $3,790 for a group of six to nine. There is a single supplement of $500 for use of an unshared tent.</p>
        <p>Treks to Ladakh and Zanskar are also offered by the following:</p>
        <p>Overseas Adventure Travel, 349 Broadway, Cambridge, Mass. 02139, (617) 876-0533 and (800) 221-0814, is running two treks to Zanskar, from July 3 to Aug. 2 and from July 31 to Aug. 30. The price is $2,990 a person for a group of from 6 to 15.</p>
        <p>Mountain Travel-Sobek, 6420 Fairmount Avenue, El Cerrito, Calif. 94530, (800) 227-2384, will be running a trek from Kishtwar, India, to Leh, the capital of Ladakh, from July 22 to Aug. 20. The trek will cross Zanskar. The cost: $2,750 a person for a group of 10 to 15.  What to Take</p>
        <p>Wilderness Travel strongly suggests that trekkers prepare for the trip by training seriously. Besides the usual jogging or walking, stair-climbing can be added to strengthen thigh muscles. Trekking poles are invaluable.</p>
        <p>Trekkers will carry only a day pack, most weighing 10 to 15 pounds, containing raingear, a warm garment, water and other items. Take good sunglasses and sunblock.</p>
        <p>The agency sends out a well-stocked medical kit with the group; if everyone were to fall ill, however, the supply could run out -- so consider taking your own. Trekkers might also want to take their own Diamox, a drug that lessens high-altitude discomfort.</p>
