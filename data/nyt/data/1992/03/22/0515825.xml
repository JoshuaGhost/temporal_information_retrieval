        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I praise the members of Congress who overdrew their accounts in the House Bank -- the more frequent the overdrafts and the higher the amounts, the higher the praise! They get an A in cash management from me, being able to get interest-free loans when banks are so reluctant to lend money. They are the people I would trust to run the fiscal affairs of our Government.</p>
        <p>Save me from those other members of Congress so inept that they put their payroll checks in a bank that pays no interest, is not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and let large balances accumulate without incurring overdrafts.</p>
        <p>The electronic news media talk about taxpayer money, when there never was any taxpayer money involved. They use the terms "bad checks" and "bounced checks," but say the bank never notified the members of Congress they were overdrawn. The news anchor doesn't see the inconsistency -- if a bank honors a check, it is not bounced, and it was not bad. One commentator pointed out that even Congressional spouses had drawn checks against these accounts. I would be happy to know that my member of Congress believes in family values and has a joint banking account with his or her spouse.</p>
        <p>In a false analogy, the news media interview people who lament they cannot borrow money without paying interest; but they put their money in a bank with F.D.I.C. insurance that must earn a profit to pay its stockholders a dividend. They should interview Korean immigrants who pool their money and then lend it to members without interest, and we all know how successful they have been.</p>
        <p>If I were a member of the House of Representatives (I do not even know one personally), I would certainly run large debit balances in my account. The purpose of a bank is to lend money anyway. WILBUR WEISEL  New Hyde Park, L.I., March 13, 1992 The writer is a lawyer and certified public accountant.</p>
