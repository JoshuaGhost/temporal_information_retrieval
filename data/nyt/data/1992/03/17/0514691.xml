        <p>Driven by its growing unpopularity among black voters, the Government of this southern African nation is forging ahead with plans to forcibly acquire large chunks of agricultural land held by white farmers.</p>
        <p>President Robert G. Mugabe appears intent on pushing aside the protests of the white farmers and ignoring pressure from Western aid donors to modify sweeping land legislation, which is set for final debate in Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Both the farmers and the donors have argued that the compulsory purchase could depress the country's excellent record of food production. A 10-Year Promise Expires</p>
        <p>The ownership of the best land by about 4,000 white farmers has been the most contentious political issue since 1980, when Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) finally won official independence from Britain.</p>
        <p>Despite promises made in the 1970's by Mr. Mugabe's guerrilla movement that land would be distributed to peasants at independence, most of the 10 million people live on small plots of semi-arid land without ownership rights.</p>
        <p>For his first decade in power, Mr. Mugabe was prevented from nationalizing white-held land under the terms of independence that were drawn up to prevent the flight of white farmers. But a year ago, at a time when ordinary people suddenly became burdened by inflation, especially higher school and medical costs, Mr. Mugabe was freed from these restrictions.</p>
        <p>Both white farmers and Western donors, including the World Bank, have told Mr. Mugabe that they agree with the principle of redressing the inequities of land holdings.</p>
        <p>But they oppose the Government's plan to designate land for acquisition arbitrarily and pay less than market rates for it. The legislation also forbids recourse to the courts. The Government says it plans to acquire 20 million of the approximately 50 million acres of mostly white-controlled commercial farmland.  Warning From Aid Donors</p>
        <p>In a statement at a World Bank meeting in Paris last month, Zimbabwe's major donors, principally Britain and the United States, cautioned that the land acquisitions would deter foreign investment and severely depress the economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe's determination to press ahead comes during the worst drought in this century, and when the usually self-sufficient nation will have to import huge quantities of grain.</p>
        <p>But at a news conference this month, Mr. Mugabe described the acquisition as a "do-or-die issue."</p>
        <p>"You cannot run a society of haves and have-nots," he said, "and hope that that society will continue to accept the situation. We have to do justice and give the communal people and other people who want to go into agriculture land to do so."  Whites Still Well Off</p>
        <p>Mr. Mugabe has often been praised for his reconciliation between blacks and whites after his bitter bush war against the whites, but he suggested last week that there were limits.</p>
        <p>Of the approximately 100,000 whites in Zimbabwe, he said: "Even after independence they have remained to be in greater comfort, greater wealth than the blacks, and we have not seized their property. We have not become vindictive in any way."</p>
        <p>The most powerful commercial farm lobby, the tobacco growers, who brought in a record $500 million in export earnings last year, have been protesting vigorously with full-page newspaper advertisements and at meetings and in speeches.</p>
        <p>The president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, Michael M. Taggart, argues that there is plenty of underutilized fertile land that could be distributed to black farmers without resorting to compulsory acquisition.</p>
        <p>"I'd say there's about 12 million acres of underutilized land in the country," he said Sunday at his tobacco farm at Enterprise, 35 miles north of Harare, the capital. "We should take the skilled farmers and put them on these areas.</p>
        <p>"By designating large blocks of land, you perpetuate this idea of them against us, white against black."</p>
