        <p>Maine and New Hampshire won semifinal games tonight at the Hockey East tournament in Boston Garden and will play for the league championship here on Saturday. The Maine team, ranked No. 1 in the nation, scored and scored against Boston College after falling behind in the second period and won, 7-3.</p>
        <p>New Hampshire (22-11-2), the second-place team in regular-season play, defeated Providence College, 5-3, in a tense contest that had one exciting save after another by the two goalies, Jeff Levy for the Wildcats and Brad Mullahy for the Friars (21-13-2).</p>
        <p>New Hampshire's Savo Mitrovic scored two goals, the second and fourth for the team, as the Wildcats led by 1-0 after one period and by 3-2 after two.</p>
        <p>Saturday night's victor will gain an automatic bid to the forthcoming 12-team N.C.A.A. tournament.</p>
        <p>The Black Bears (30-3-2) trailed by 3-2 in the second period. Randy Olson, a third-line left wing, began the assault on Eagles goaltender Scott LaGrand by scoring the tying goal at 14 minutes 54 seconds of the second period.</p>
        <p>The winning goal was scored by Scott Pellerin, Maine's ace, less than two minutes later, 16:26 of the second period. Earlier, at an awards luncheon, Pellerin had been named the Hockey East player of the year.</p>
        <p>The occasion marked the end of Len Ceglarski's coaching career, his last game behind the bench for the Eagles (14-18-3). After 34 years, the 65-year-old Ceglarski is retiring after 673 victories, the most for any coach in college hockey history. He is to be succeeded by his top assistant, Steve Cedorchuk. SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JACK PARKER of Boston University was named the Hockey East coach of the year by his peers. Parker squeezed 22 victories out of a team that skated 9 freshmen and had to replace 12 players from last year's squad. . . . TIM TAYLOR of Yale was voted the coach-of-the-year award in ECAC Hockey, and DANIEL LaPERRIERE, the St. Lawrence defenseman, was named the player of the year. Taylor's team was picked for ninth place but finished fourth, while LaPerriere had a hand in 14 of the Saints' 20 winning goals. . . . The ECAC semifinal games in Boston on Friday night will match Cornell (13-10-4) against Clarkson (22-8-1), and Rensselaer (14-14-4) against St. Lawrence (20-9-2).</p>
