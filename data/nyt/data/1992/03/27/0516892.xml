        <p>The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed by 15,000 in the second week of March, the Labor Department said today, pointing to what various economists say is likely to be a lackluster, slow-to-arrive recovery.</p>
        <p>The department said 447,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 14, up from a revised 432,000 the previous week. It had previously put the number of new claims in the March 7 week at 433,000.</p>

        <p>The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed by 15,000 in the second week of March, the Labor Department said today, pointing to what various economists say is likely to be a lackluster, slow-to-arrive recovery.</p>
        <p>The department said 447,000 people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 14, up from a revised 432,000 the previous week. It had previously put the number of new claims in the March 7 week at 433,000.</p>
        <p>Wall Street economists had expected 440,000 new applications in the latest period.</p>
        <p>"There are no signs of any strengthening in the labor force," said Kevin Flanagan, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
        <p>The claims numbers, said David Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., "were disappointing and indicated that we are certainly not out of the woods yet." He added that although claims had appeared to be declining, today's report showed that "we still have a problem."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyss also noted that unlike overall unemployment, jobless claims should show improvement fairly quickly as the economy began to recover.</p>
        <p>The department said the four-week average for new claims, regarded as a more accurate measure of the number of jobless than the weekly figure, slipped to 444,000 in the latest period from 446,750.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said the total number of people receiving state unemployment benefits in the latest period was unavailable.</p>
        <p>Oklahoma registered the biggest rise in new claims, with 4,124 new filings, followed by Michigan's 2,776.</p>
        <p>Michigan said its increase in claims stemmed from layoffs in the automobile industry, reversing the trend of the previous week. Oklahoma officials did not comment.</p>
        <p>Missouri and New York reported the largest drop in new claims, with both states reporting about 4,000 fewer filings. Missouri reported nearly 1,700 new claims the previous week because of layoffs in the food processing and transportation industries. No reason was given for the decline in New York.</p>
