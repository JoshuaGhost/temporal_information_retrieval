        <p>Nancy Walker was a funny woman. Millions remember her as Rhoda's mother on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and its spinoff "Rhoda," and as that waitress in the commercial who was forever scrubbing counters with the "quicker picker-upper." And when they do, they smile.</p>
        <p>But those who were lucky enough to have seen her on Broadway know she was something more. She was, like Bert Lahr, a great clown. Both had a memorable way with dialogue; even so, it was something in the way they moved that made them hilarious.</p>

        <p>But those who were lucky enough to have seen her on Broadway know she was something more. She was, like Bert Lahr, a great clown. Both had a memorable way with dialogue; even so, it was something in the way they moved that made them hilarious.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, her performance in Noel Coward's "Fallen Angels," during which, wound in a telephone cord and buffeted by a swinging door, she had an audience weeping with laughter. But Nancy Walker didn't really</p>
        <p>need</p>
        <p>telephone cords and swinging doors. All she needed was her own off-center self.</p>
        <p>"We comics are a strange breed," she said once. "We all have the same needs, the same wants, the same attitudes toward life, but our bones are set one-eighth-of-an-inch off. We don't come out the same as other people. Well, whoever set those bones I want to give a letter of thanks to."</p>
        <p>So might everyone who ever saw Nancy Walker.</p>
