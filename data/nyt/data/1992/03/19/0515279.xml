        <p>In an election-year gesture to the United States, Japan today announced a big reduction in its ceiling for automobile exports, saying it would limit exports to 1.65 million a year, down sharply from 2.3 million now.</p>
        <p>While the move marks a significant concession by Japan, its impact on the reeling American automobile industry is likely to be limited. In part because of the depressed auto market and in part because of the increasing number of cars manufactured at Japanese "transplant" factories in the United States, Japan exported only about 1.76 million cars to the American market in 1991, or only 110,000 above the new ceiling. That was the fifth consecutive year that Japanese exports to America fell below 2.3 million, the level that has been in effect since the mid-1980's.</p>

        <p>In an election-year gesture to the United States, Japan today announced a big reduction in its ceiling for automobile exports, saying it would limit exports to 1.65 million a year, down sharply from 2.3 million now.</p>
        <p>While the move marks a significant concession by Japan, its impact on the reeling American automobile industry is likely to be limited. In part because of the depressed auto market and in part because of the increasing number of cars manufactured at Japanese "transplant" factories in the United States, Japan exported only about 1.76 million cars to the American market in 1991, or only 110,000 above the new ceiling. That was the fifth consecutive year that Japanese exports to America fell below 2.3 million, the level that has been in effect since the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>Though there will be little effect on the actual number of cars shipped to the United States, Japanese officials are betting that the Bush Administration will be able to greet the announcement as a victory. Mr. Bush's ill-fated trip to Japan in January focused tremendous attention on the automobile issue -- autos make up about 75 percent of the trade deficit -- and the Japanese clearly hope the Administration will be able to cite the lowering of the export limits as a response to pressure from the President.</p>
        <p>[ In Washington, an American trade official declined to discuss the new export level announced by the Japanese, but said, "What the U.S. is after is opening the Japanese market."  ]</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, as Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry has debated whether to keep the formal limit at 2.3 million or to reduce it, officials have made little secret of the fact that they were keeping one eye on the Presidential primaries.</p>
        <p>The unexpectedly deep cut in the limit seemed to suggest that the growing calls for protectionism in the United States jolted the Japanese auto industry and the Government into taking an action that they have resisted for several years. But it is not clear whether the Japanese strategy -- to offer a concession now in hopes that it will defuse any movement for sharper limits that might emerge later in the campaign -- will prove successful.</p>
        <p>"Japan-U.S. relations are quite important," Kozo Watanabe, the Trade Minister, said recently. "Economic policy must be developed to make Japan-U.S. relations better."</p>
        <p>The new export restraints will go into effect on April 1, the beginning of the Japanese fiscal year. The trade ministry has estimated that exports to the United States would total 1.73 million cars in the new fiscal year, meaning that the auto industry will have to trim its plans slightly. Presumably, some manufacturing could be moved to American transplants, which are not affected by the limits.</p>
        <p>This will be the 12th consecutive year for the restraints, although they were originally conceived as a temporary measure to give Detroit a chance to grow more competitive.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials say in private that the initiative has largely failed and that they see little evidence that the American auto makers used the voluntary limits to lift productivity or reduce the price of American autos. But they view the restraints as politically useful, at little cost to the Japanese economy. Every year for five years Japanese car exports have been well below 2.3 million, but the market share of Japanese cars has risen above 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Japanese auto makers have also seen their revenues from export rise, largely because they are shipping larger, more expensive cars to the United States, vehicles like Toyota's Lexus and Honda's Acura. The American transplant factories have been used to produce less expensive, higher-volume models.</p>
