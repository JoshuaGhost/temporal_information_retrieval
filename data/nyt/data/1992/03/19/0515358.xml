        <p>"If everything goes as planned and our investigators are complete with what they need to do, we hope to be able to go to the state attorney next week," Lieut. Scott Bartal told reporters during a brief news conference in front of the Police Department headquarters.</p>
        <p>David C. Morgan, an assistant Florida state attorney, is responsible for making the determination whether to prosecute the case based on information the police provide him.</p>
        <p>Moving the case to Morgan does not necessarily mean that the police have established a particularly strong case against the players, Lieutenant Bartal cautioned. "Even if it turns out not to be a case here, we are presenting what we have to the state attorney," he said in a later interview.</p>
        <p>At this point, he added, "no arrests have been made or are they imminent."  BASEBALL</p>
