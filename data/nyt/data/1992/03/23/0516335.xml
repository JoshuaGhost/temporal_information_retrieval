        <p>The agreement structured by Mayor David N. Dinkins's office shows 1992 is a good time for bargains.</p>
        <p>Similar criticism was voiced in the 1970's, when New York Telephone and Teacher's Annuity bought 1166 Avenue of Americas for $30 million. A few years later, half the building was sold for $165 million. What was first seen as a sign of a weak economy was an appropriate business deal by the city and the two corporations. The same half of the building sold for $100 million more a few years later.</p>
        <p>Bertelsmann understands the importance of New York City. It is time for others to take advantage of what New York City has to offer and come back. LEWIS RUDIN  Chmn., Assn. for a Better New York New York, March 11, 1992</p>
