        <p>Gantos Inc., a chain of women's apparel stores, yesterday named Michele Fortune president and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fortune, currently executive vice president for merchandising and marketing at the troubled Hit or Miss store chain, will join Gantos on April 13. The company is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., and has 158 stores in the Midwest and Northeast.</p>
        <p>Hit or Miss recently announced that it would close 75 of its 576 stores, which have been a losing proposition for its parent, the TJX Companies, since 1989.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fortune could not be reached for comment yesterday at Hit or Miss headquarters in Boston.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fortune brings more than 20 years of specialty retailing experience to Gantos, including stints at Lord &amp; Taylor and Ann Taylor.</p>
        <p>At the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation she was president and chief executive from 1987 to 1989, when she was dismissed by Joseph E. Brooks, who led a leveraged buyout that took the company private. Retail consultants credit Ms. Fortune with adding flair and style to Ann Taylor's merchandise.</p>
        <p>She had worked with Mr. Brooks for 12 years at Lord &amp; Taylor, where she rose through the buying division to become senior vice president and general merchandising manager.</p>
        <p>She began her career in 1975 as a buyer at Filene's, then a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.</p>
        <p>A native of California, Ms. Fortune has a liberal arts degree from Idaho State University.</p>
