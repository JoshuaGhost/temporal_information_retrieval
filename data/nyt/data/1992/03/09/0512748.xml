        <p>Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said today that he and his wife, Hillary, did nothing improper when they entered a real-estate partnership with the owner of a savings and loan institution that was subject to state regulation.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters as he campaigned through Texas today for votes in the Democratic Presidential primary on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton said that an article about the partnership in The New York Times on Sunday was misleading and that he and his wife lost more than $25,000 in the joint venture.</p>
        <p>"There was no impropriety," Mr. Clinton said of the partnership with his former aide, James B. McDougal, to develop land in the Ozarks. Financial Exposure</p>
        <p>The partnership began in 1978, when Mr. Clinton was Arkansas's Attorney General. "I was not yet Governor," he said today, and Mr. McDougal "was not in any financial institution."</p>
        <p>"The article seems to imply that my wife and I had no financial exposure," he went on. "There's nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
        <p>"We were jointly and severally liable for more than $200,000 worth of debt," Mr. Clinton said. He termed the relationship "purely private investment" that was "nothing but a big money loser for me."</p>
        <p>The Times article raised questions about the Clintons' relationship with Mr. McDougal and Whitewater Development, a corporation that planned to turn the 200 acres of Ozarks property into lots for vacation homes.</p>
        <p>Records obtained by The New York Times were incomplete, but the article questioned the Clintons' involvement in the venture at a time when Mr. McDougal's savings institution, Madison Guaranty, was subject to regulation by the state securities commission. 'Honest Error'</p>
        <p>The article also said that on their tax returns in 1984 and 1985 the Clintons improperly deducted at least $5,000 in interest payments on bank loan payments that Whitewater made for them. The deductions saved them about $1,000 in taxes. Mr. Clinton said he and his wife were reviewing their tax records and would repay the amount, which his lawyer, Susan P. Thomases, described as an "honest error."</p>
        <p>Before the Times article was published, the Clintons turned down requests for interviews, instead retaining lawyers to answer questions about the enterprise. The lawyers were interviewed for several hours in person and several hours by telephone and provided 15 to 20 documents.</p>
        <p>In an interview in The Arkansas Democrat Gazette today, Mr. McDougal was quoted as saying that the Clintons did nothing improper and that neither he nor his savings and loan got preferential treatment.</p>
        <p>In a separate statement at Mr. Clinton's news conference today, Sam Heuer, Mr. McDougal's lawyer, said he was "appalled and affronted by the allegations and reckless disregard of the facts by The New York Times and its reporter, Jeff Gerth." He said any suggestion that Mr. McDougal used money from Madison Guaranty to subsidize the Clintons' portion of the joint partnership was "not only false but probably actionable by Mr. McDougal." Mr. Heuer said that there was "no link between Whitewater Development Company and Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan."</p>
        <p>The Times article cited records showing that in 1984, when White water's account at Madison was overdrawn, money was deposited to make up the shortage from Madison Marketing, an affiliate of the savings and loan.</p>
        <p>The article also called attention to Mr. Clinton's appointment of Beverly Bassett Schaffer, a lawyer in a firm that had represented Madison Guaranty, as State Securities Commissioner at a time when the institution faced possible closure by the state.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Clinton said his appointing Mrs. Schaffer was not a way of aiding Mr. McDougal.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Schaffer, in a statement also released by the campaign, concurred.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton conceded that as Governor, he perhaps should have found a way to extricate himself from the financial relationship. "But frankly, at the time it never crossed my mind because we were losing money."</p>
