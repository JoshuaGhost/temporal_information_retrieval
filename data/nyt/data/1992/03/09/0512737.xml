        <p>Seeking an election-year showdown on abortion rights, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have begun separate initiatives intended to preserve a woman's right to an abortion.</p>
        <p>Republican women in the House and Senate are among the sponsors of a new group formed to raise money for female Republican candidates who support abortion rights.</p>
        <p>The group calls itself Wish List, for "Women in the Senate and House," its goal. But the group also intends to support candidates for governor, and even mayor, when there are races it considers strategically important. Freedom of Choice Act</p>
        <p>At the same time, a group of House Democrats is seeking passage for a bill called the Freedom of Choice Act that would prohibit a state from restricting the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability, or at any time if necessary to protect the life or health of a woman. When a fetus can live by itself outside the womb is a matter of debate.</p>
        <p>"We want abortion rights to be a focus in this election," Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who is a sponsor of the legislation, said in an interview. "Congress is the only thing standing in the way of repeal of Roe v. Wade," the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.</p>
        <p>Wish List, which last month raised $100,000 for female Republican candidates who support abortion rights, was founded by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, the only Republican woman in the Senate, and six of the nine Republican women in the House. 'It's Long Overdue'</p>
        <p>"I think it's long overdue," Representative Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican of Maine and member of Wish List, said in an interview. "There are so few Republican women in the U.S. Congress, and no governors. Once you have an organization devoted to electing more Republican women who are pro-choice, you assemble the necessary resources to achieve that goal."</p>
        <p>Although President Bush strongly opposes abortion, Republican leaders are concerned about a possible loss of support in the face of judicial restrictions of abortion rights and have said the party was large enough to accomodate all views on the issue.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder cited opinion polls that she said indicated that 69 percent of all voters, including more than 60 percent of Republican voters, favored Federal legislation to guarantee abortion rights.</p>
        <p>But Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said: "We don't see a ground swell of support for abortion in the polls. We see pollsters who ask Americans, 'Under what circumstances should abortion be legal?' and find a majority or near majority supporting the President's position that abortion should be unlawful except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest."</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey Republican who opposes abortion, said he welcomed a Congressional showdown because "the penalty for supporting abortion on demand will attach itself to Congressional incumbents and challengers."</p>
        <p>A New York Times-CBS poll of 1,281 people conducted last Jan. 22-25 found that 40 percent believed that "abortion should be generally available to those who want it;" 39 percent thought that "abortion should be available but under stricter limits than it is now;" 19 percent agreed that "abortion should not be permitted," and 2 percent had no opinion. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>Even if Congress passed the Freedom of Choice Act, there is no certainty that the President would not veto it. But Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said, "The President has bowed to pressure on other issues, and who knows, the pro-choice pressure may get so great that a miracle might happen."</p>
        <p>In any event, she said in an interview, "when the judiciary does not live up to its responsibility to protect rights, the legislative branch must come into play."</p>
        <p>But some Congressional Democratic leaders said that even though they favored abortion rights, they had reservations about the bill. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said last month that although he supported the bill's purpose he had "concerns about the use of a statute to define and secure a constitutional right." If a majority of Congress could establish abortion rights, he said, a future Congress could undo those rights.</p>
        <p>The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, told reporters on Wednesday that he wanted to wait until the next Supreme Court ruling on an abortion case before bringing the bill to the floor. A Foley aide said that the Speaker felt that the legislation could be tailored to restore any rights that were lost in the pending case, involving Pennsylvania's restrictions on abortions, which were upheld last October by a Federal appeals court. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the law's constitutionality in June.</p>
        <p>Under the Pennsylvania law, women under 18 years of age would need parental consent for an abortion or a court ruling waiving such consent. Another provision would require that women seeking an abortion must give their "informed consent," which would require them to wait 24 hours after counseling from a doctor before an abortion is performed.</p>
