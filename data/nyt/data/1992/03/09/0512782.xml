        <p>IF Michael Harrington was a hero of American social welfare advocates in the 1960's, Joseph McDowell Mitchell was their nemesis.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mitchell was driven into political oblivion from his job as City Manager of Newburgh, N.Y., leaders of the welfare-rights movement heaved a collective sigh of relief. Fully 30 years later, though, he haunts the national welfare debate that he briefly dominated. Semiretired in northeast Florida, he may be smugly wondering whether revisionists will some day conclude that if he was a racist, a reactionary and a rabble-rouser he was also ahead of his time.</p>
        <p>What is so striking about the 13 welfare regulations he sought to impose three decades ago is not how Draconian they seem in retrospect, but how many of them have been adopted, proposed or rationally discussed in recent months by Republicans and more than a few Democrats.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Mitchell's regulations were voided by the State Supreme Court in 1962, they transformed Newburgh from an obscure Hudson River city of 31,000 into a national symbol of revolt against Federally mandated welfare programs, benefits that critics maintained redistributed wealth from productive taxpayers to an expanding and parasitic dependent class.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing furor over Newburgh's brand of welfare reform, Mr. Mitchell was hailed by Senator Barry M. Goldwater, defended by the Young Americans for Freedom, and elevated from a minor local official to a national political figure with an ego and ambition to match.</p>
        <p>His oratory grew increasingly strident, his statistics were sometimes distorted or incomplete, and he scapegoated blacks when in fact the welfare rolls in Orange County numbered more whites at that time and, regardless of their racial composition, were hardly the underlying cause of aging Newburgh's inability to adapt to changing times. But behind the furor he ignited was a platform that whatever its motivation, may no longer seem quite so shockingly onerous or politically accursed.</p>
        <p>Instead of disbursing cash, Mr. Mitchell wanted to distribute vouchers for food, clothing and rent. Able-bodied adult men would be required to work or lose their benefits. Unmarried mothers would be denied welfare payments if they had more children out of wedlock. Payments to people other than the blind, elderly or disabled would be limited to three months in any year. If a family's home life was found to be unsatisfactory, payments for the children would be ended and they would be placed in foster homes instead. Prescriptions approved for welfare recipients would be filled with generic, rather than brand-name, drugs. And welfare recipients would be photographed to prevent fraud.</p>
        <p>Newburgh was barred from enforcing all the rules except one: the requirement that welfare recipients report monthly for a conference on their cases. Nonetheless, Mr. Mitchell credited his administration with reducing the caseload to about 3 percent of the city's population. Today, welfare recipients account for 11 percent of the population of the city and surrounding town of Newburgh.</p>
        <p>Last year, nine states cut basic welfare benefits and 31 states froze them. In January, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, said he would consider proposals to fingerprint welfare recipients to prevent fraud. In Connecticut, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a lapsed Republican who was elected as an independent, has proposed a six-month limit on benefits for able-bodied people. Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, signed a law that makes New Jersey the only state to deny the standard additional subsidy -- $2.12 a day -- for welfare mothers who have more children.</p>
        <p>In California, Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, would reduce benefits by 10 percent immediately for all welfare families and by 15 percent more for people who remain on welfare longer than six months, would deny benefits for additional children and would grant newcomers to California no more in relief than they received in their home state.</p>
        <p>"I saw the phrase 'deserving poor' the other day and it reminded me of Newburgh," said James R. Dumpson, who heads New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation board and who, as New York City's welfare commissioner, vigorously opposed Mr. Mitchell's agenda. "We still dare to say, 'After six months you are no longer deserving.' "</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel P. Moynihan is no defender of Mr. Mitchell as the Galileo of welfare reform. But in three decades the search for solutions seems to have come full circle. The Senator suggests that public resentment toward the welfare budget today is one consequence of the outright rejection of Mr. Mitchell's answers by social-service advocates without acknowledging the validity of some of his underlying questions.</p>
        <p>"The questions were disallowed," Mr. Moynihan said.</p>
        <p>Today, some of the answers sound starkly familiar. "I'm aware of that," Mr. Mitchell said on Friday in an abbreviated telephone interview, declining to second-guess his own answers of 30 years ago to questions that are only marginally more tolerable but have not gone away.</p>
