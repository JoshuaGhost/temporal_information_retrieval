        <p>Dell Bows Out</p>
        <p>Editors at Dell Books thought they had the perfect way to capitalize on the interest in John Gotti's racketeering-murder trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. They were going to edit the transcripts and the secret F.B.I. tapes and rush out the kind of quickie book that has become a staple of the publishing house.</p>
        <p>Yesterday they decided otherwise. Times Books, it seems, had already begun work on the same project, and Roger Bilheimer, a vice president in charge of publicity at Dell, said, "We decided we just didn't want to be involved in a race."</p>
        <p>Usually when publishers commission and publish a book on short notice, they compete against other publishers with the same idea. Several books, for example, were rushed into print about Jeffrey L. Dahmer, the serial killer whose trial ended recently in Milwaukee. In such situations publishers hope the writers they get or the interviews they snare will raise their book above the others.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Gotti trial transcripts, little would have distinguished the Dell book from the Times book except editing choices and the cover, so Dell decided the potential payoff wasn't worth the risk.</p>
        <p>Instead, Dell has decided on another strategy to capitalize on the Gotti trial: tickling the backlist, that is, drawing attention to books on the subject which the house has already published. So Dell is soliciting new orders for the paperback version of its 1988 book "Mob Star: The Story of John Gotti," by Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci, and 50,000 new copies of the book are being printed. Alternative Strategies</p>
        <p>There are other ways to milk the trial, too. In a more dramatic bid to draw attention to a Gotti book, Avon Books said it would have a man in a Mafia-style black suit outside the Brooklyn courthouse at noon today to hand out copies of "Goombata: The Improbable Rise and Fall of John Gotti and His Gang," by Ernest Volkman and John Cummings.</p>
        <p>Interest in Mafia and mob dealings is high among both publishers and readers, prompting some stores to set up niches on the subject. Popular among the current books are: "Double Cross: The Explosive Inside Story of the Mobster Who Controlled America" (Warner), by Sam Giancana and Chuck Giancana, two relatives of the late Sam Giancana, which will be No. 2 on The New York Times hard-cover nonfiction best-seller list on Sunday; "Mob Girl: A Woman's Life in the Underworld" (Simon &amp; Schuster) by Teresa Carpenter, the story of Arleyne Brickman, who grew up among Jewish racketeers in New York City, was the lover of several leading crime bosses, including Joe Colombo, and then became a Federal informer, and "Quitting the Mob: How the Yuppie Don Left the Mafia and Lived to Tell His Story" (HarperCollins) by Michael Franzese and Dary Matera.</p>
        <p>Island Books, a new Dell paperback imprint, is hoping the interest will last until the fall, when they plan to come out with the paperback edition of "Boss of Bosses," a book about Paul Castellano by two F.B.I. agents, Joseph F. O'Brien and Andris Kurins.  Indians and Columbus</p>
        <p>With the onslaught of children's Christopher Columbus books that have been published and are scheduled to be published in the months leading up to the quincentenary of his arrival in America, several critics have lamented that none of the books were done from the perspective of the Indians, specifically the Taino tribe in North America, who were living here before Columbus.</p>
        <p>Behold the spring, summer and fall lists, which have redressed the omission. Among the children's books due out soon are: "Encounter" (Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich) by Jane Yolen, with lush, dazzling illustrations; "The Taino" (Putnam) by Francine Jacobs and "Morning Girl" (Hyperion), a novel by Michael Dorris about a native family in the Bahamas around 1492.</p>
