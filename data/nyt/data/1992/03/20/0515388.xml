        <p>Detroit's Big Three were not impressed today by Japan's announcement that it would reduce the number of cars it exports to the United States to 1.65 million a year, saying the Japanese are still not playing fair.</p>
        <p>And the United States said it did not seek the cut in Japanese car exports. "It was the Japanese decision on their own," a White House official said.</p>
        <p>"They give the misleading impression that something meaningful is being done to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan," the General Motors Corporation said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Harold Poling, said, "All that has happened is that the Japanese Government has proposed a voluntary level for 1992 at about the same volume their auto makers imported into the United States from Japan in 1991."</p>
        <p>The current ceiling is 2.3 million a year but sales are running at 1.76 million.  The Chrysler Corporation said the quota should be slashed to one million vehicles a year to "get back to a level playing field for everybody.</p>
