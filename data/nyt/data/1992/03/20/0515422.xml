        <p>Authorities said that one of the six being interviewed in New York had called the police here to volunteer information.</p>
        <p>"The information that we were given on the phone by this person we feel is critical to our investigation," said Lieut. Scott Bartal, a spokesman for the Port St. Lucie Police Department and one of three investigators assigned to the case.</p>
        <p>Bartal also said that the police intend to interview the three players, but that no interviews had been scheduled yet.</p>
