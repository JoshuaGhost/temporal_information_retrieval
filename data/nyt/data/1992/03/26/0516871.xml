        <p>"WIG Wag Worm" is a soft-bodied cloth worm linked together with Velcro. Children put Wig Wag back together by matching up the links. Donna Pettick, an occupational therapist, finds this toy, as well as almost 200 others she distributes, modifies and designs, to be happy therapy for mildly- to severely-disabled children. All are available through Kapable Kids, her mail-order catalogue company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pettick is not alone. Susan White of Cranbury, N.J., got so fed up with looking for the right toys for her 6-year-old son, who has learning problems, that she started Funtastic Therapy, a mail-order company that offers therapeutic toys for children with mild disabilities. "Mr. Mighty Mind, " for example, is a paper-and-wood puzzle that challenges children's visual and motor skills; it is one of about 200 educational toys in the Funtastic Therapy catalogue.</p>
