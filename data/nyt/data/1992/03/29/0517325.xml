        <p>Nancy Marx Better's article ("Green Teens," March 8) was very realistic. I am 16 years old and I spent two whole months last summer walking door to door in neighborhoods all over my county. I was canvassing for donations for litigation and lobbying so that big and "bad" companies would be forced to pay their penalties for dumping their waste into the ocean and throwing away plastics instead of recycling. The group I worked for was literally filled with young people under the age of 25.</p>
        <p>I was very discouraged when adults and even the elderly would slam doors in my face and tell me, "You young people are just wasting our time." I was told many times that big companies will always stay the same, and that by canvassing for the environment we were wasting the taxpayers' money in a battle that could never be won by "the little people."</p>

        <p>I would hope that in the future my own parents and older people in general would see that what we young people are fighting for is not a joke. As a "green teen," I've learned that recycling is not enough; litigation and lobbying are important as well. The truth is that without the "green teens" of today, the earth will be in shambles tomorrow. AMY WU</p>
