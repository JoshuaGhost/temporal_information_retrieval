        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Get Tough With Ukraine" (Op-Ed, March 4), Dimitri K. Simes again tries to blame the victim for the crime. After 300 years of Russian occupation involving the attempted destruction of the Ukrainian langauge, culture and history, Ukraine knows that independence cannot be preserved with a foreign army on Ukrainian soil.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simes is disingenuous to criticize Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, for promising "to resettle thousands of Germans and Tatars in the Crimea." The Crimea did not belong to Russia, but to the Tatars, and it was Moscow that uprooted and scattered the Tatars and Germans in an effort to destroy their identity. Ukraine, having suffered from that same Russification policy, is helping these nationalities rebuild their communities.</p>

        <p>Dr. Simes is disingenuous to criticize Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, for promising "to resettle thousands of Germans and Tatars in the Crimea."

Ukraine, having suffered from that same Russification policy, is helping these nationalities rebuild their communities.</p>
        <p>The United States could help mediate disputes among Commonwealth of Independent States members but only if the United States took an evenhanded approach. Insisting that all Commonwealth members pay their share of the Soviet debt while remaining silent on Russia's seizure of all Soviet assets, which would provide the members the wherewithal to pay, is not evenhandedness.</p>
        <p>The United States has even remained silent on Russia's seizure for its embassy of the seven buildings in Washington once owned by the Soviet Union. The other 10 Commonwealth members, which contributed to the purchase of these buildings, and whose hard currency was seized by Russia with other assets of the Central Bank, are unable to purchase new buildings for their embassies.</p>
        <p>As Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger point out, it is time for the world's democracies to let Russia know that imperialism, in any form, will not be tolerated. It is time the United States treated the other 10 members of Commonwealth as the independent states they are, not colonies of Russia. EUGENE M. IWANCIW Director, Ukrainian National Assn. Washington, March 4, 1992</p>
