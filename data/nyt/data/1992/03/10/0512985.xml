        <p>A report by an independent panel of economists concludes that developing countries that follow the programs of the International Monetary Fund usually make substantial cuts in social welfare spending as well as large cuts in their top income tax rates.</p>
        <p>But that conclusion, which tends to bolster longtime criticisms of the secretive international lending institution, was accompanied by another: Countries that adhere to I.M.F. programs increase their growth more and reduce their trade-deficit problems faster than do countries that fail to follow the fund's prescriptions.</p>
        <p>The report, by a nonpartisan group called the I.M.F. Assessment Project, concludes that the I.M.F. systematically pushes countries to reduce their budget deficits and that as a result these countries usually agree to cuts in food subsidies, housing spending or other social spending.</p>
        <p>The report found that developing countries that adhered to the I.M.F.'s fiscal and monetary targets in the late 1980's saw their economic growth jump from 2 percent a year to 4.1 percent, while countries that failed to meet the targets saw their growth inch up from 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent. Closely Guarded Operations</p>
        <p>The project, which was financed by foundations, companies and individuals, sought to shed more light on the I.M.F.'s closely guarded operations. It was carried out by a group of economists, both conservative and liberal, under the aegis of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a nonprofit research foundation based in Arlington, Va. The project's advisory board includes Cyrus R. Vance, who was Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter, and William E. Simon, who was Treasury Secretary under President Gerald R. Ford.</p>
        <p>The group found that the I.M.F. did not dictate programs to developing countries that turn to it for financial aid. It said the I.M.F. strived to tailor its recommendations to the conditions of individual countries, but in doing so, generally encouraged "the development of free markets, the removal of price controls and a reduced reliance on state ownership."</p>
        <p>The study, led by Gregory A. Fossedal, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, noted that the I.M.F. pressed countries to adopt policies favorable to wealth creation, and as a result often recommended that they lower their top tax rates. The report showed that in 20 countries with I.M.F. programs, the average top tax rate was cut to 39 percent in 1990 from 59 percent in 1982. I.M.F. officials have long said that cutting the top tax rate helps to reduce tax evasion.</p>
        <p>The report showed that in 48 I.M.F. programs from 1986 to 1990, 92 percent of the countries reduced spending in housing, health care or economic aid programs like food subsidies. It also said that 62 percent of the programs made cuts in two of those three areas, and that 29 percent of the programs involved overall social spending cuts of more than 20 percent. In these countries, social spending was reduced from 11.1 percent of gross national product to 10.2 percent. The report said that 78 percent of these programs called for cuts in overall government spending.  Maintaining Safety Net</p>
        <p>The report said that in pushing for deficit reduction, the I.M.F. did not stress cutting social spending. It added, "The I.M.F. now routinely insists that countries make a reasonable effort to maintain a social safety net."</p>
        <p>I.M.F. officials said they had not yet seen the report, so they could not comment. But officials of the fund have long asserted that they do not tell countries receiving I.M.F. help what to do, saying they set up targets for cutting budget deficits and then leave it to the countries to decide how to cut their deficits. I.M.F. officials have often advised countries that they should weigh social spending more effectively, arguing, for example, that food subsidies are inefficient because in many cases they help those who are not poor.</p>
        <p>"There's a tendency to reduce social spending across the board," said Mr. Fossedal, the project's chairman. "At the same time the fund argues that it's possible to have reduced levels of spending, yet constant, or even increased, levels of real benefit for the poor."</p>
        <p>The report said that reducing poverty and improving the environment "do not appear to be elements" of I.M.F. programs, while "limited or reduced spending in these areas tends to be" an element of such programs.</p>
        <p>On exchange rates, the report states that the fund prefers that countries adopt floating or flexible exchange rates because devaluing their currencies helps reduce their trade and current account deficits. But such devaluations often hurt consumers by raising the price of imported goods.</p>
        <p>"The fund seeks to minimize its involvement in specific tax and budget policies," the report said. "It works with countries in an effort to set prudent, sustainable overall limits on budget, trade and monetary policy."</p>
