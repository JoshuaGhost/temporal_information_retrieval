        <p>Although much younger than its ancient prototypes, the noble neo-classical temple tucked incongruously in the dark canyons of the garment district has gone through many metamorphoses. Completed in 1924 as the Greenwich Savings Bank headquarters, it became a Metropolitan Savings Bank branch in 1981, a Crossland Savings Bank branch in 1985 and a Crossland Federal Savings Bank branch in January.</p>
        <p>Now, it is also an official New York City landmark. This month, the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated both the monumental exterior -- with 40-foot Corinthian columns on the Broadway, 36th Street and Avenue of the Americas facades -- and the extravagant interior, which includes an elliptical banking room under a 72-foot-high skylight. The architects York &amp; Sawyer created "a veritable temple to thrift and one of the finest examples" of the academic classical style in this country, the commission said.</p>

        <p>Crossland has a long-term lease on the bank building, said Tracie Rozhon, the spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, but the owner is Gerald Rosenberg, in care of the Rosenberg &amp; Rosenberg law firm, who went on record at the public hearing as being opposed to designation. The Real Estate Directory of Manhattan shows the owner as Malcolm Rosenberg, also of Rosenberg &amp; Rosenberg. Neither owner would comment last week.</p>
