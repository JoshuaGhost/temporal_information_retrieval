        <p>As those guys panting after the Democratic nomination began to show primary results, the telepundit Mark Shields said of Gov. Bill Clinton, "He won the</p>
        <p>inside-the-Beltway</p>
        <p>primary."</p>
        <p>The Beltway in this usage is the Capital Beltway, a circumferential highway that enables traffic to skirt, or bypass, the city streets. In many American small towns, such a traffic-reliever is called a</p>
        <p>bypass</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>In Britain, the term is</p>
        <p>ring road</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>ringway</p>
        <p>, though some wish to gentrify that to</p>
        <p>orbital road</p>
        <p>.  The heart of Moscow is circled by the</p>
        <p>Sadovoye Koltso (sadovoye</p>
        <p>means "garden";</p>
        <p>koltso</p>
        <p>is Russian for "ring").</p>
        <p>Mr. Shields was not, of course, referring to a primary held in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>Inside the Beltway</p>
        <p>is not a place but a state of mind; used as a compound adjective, the prepositional phrase means "having the conventional wisdom held by self-described political insiders."</p>
        <p>The political term first appeared in The Washington Post atop a fishing story in 1977: "</p>
        <p>Inside-the-Beltway</p>
        <p>Trout Fishing Nears." But not until 1983, according to my Nexis search, did its political-insider sense come to the fore. In a Newsweek article an anonymous Democratic campaign manager was quoted as refusing to derogate the possibility of a return by former Senator George McGovern: "If he's perceived as a man on a fool's errand, that's still</p>
        <p>inside the</p>
        <p>[ Washington ]</p>
        <p>Beltway</p>
        <p>, not the world as a whole."</p>
        <p>Two years later, the phrase still required a bracketed explanation. A United Press International report from Washington quoted Mark Russell, the humorist, making this assessment of Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming: "Simpson epitomizes the Western disdain for '</p>
        <p>inside-the-beltway</p>
        <p>'  [ Washington know-it-alls ] ." In 1991, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa used the phrase in the Clarence Thomas hearings: "ordinary American people, who look at things differently than are looked at here</p>
        <p>inside the Beltway</p>
        <p>."</p>
        <p>A few now use the phrase to describe "the real inside skinny"; it is the title of a gossipy news column in The Washington Times. Most prefer the sense of "showing insular thinking, removed from the heartland." John Leo, the stylish essayist in U.S. News &amp; World Report, assessed the opinions of a group of opinionators about Pat Buchanan by pointing out that "Almost every one . . . comes from the same tiny hothouse: the</p>
        <p>inside-the-beltway</p>
        <p>punditry industry."</p>
        <p>The phrase reflects a populist disdain for central government, though it is most often used by people who live in its environs. Part of the general running-against-Washington movement, it is more anti-ineffectual than anti-intellectual.</p>
        <p>Hyphenate the phrase when used as a modifier before the noun it describes.  Capitalize the</p>
        <p>B</p>
        <p>when making reference to the Washington Beltway, as you capitalize the</p>
        <p>M</p>
        <p>in Washington Monument, a rule that covers most use today; ultimately, this important new bit of political slang will lower the case as it takes on a meaning of general insiderness.</p>
        <p>Two related phrases:</p>
        <p>Beltway bandits</p>
        <p>are consultants, usually to the defense industry, who practice inside the Beltway; use is lessening because defense contracts are no longer the ripe plums they used to be.</p>
        <p>In the loop</p>
        <p>, a place George Bush denied being during the Iran-contra affair, means "among those consulted," usually a tight circle.</p>
        <p>Loop</p>
        <p>, or circle, was used in Chicago at the turn of the century, when the titan Charles Tyson Yerkes built the railway known as the Loop around the downtown business district; the area itself is now known as the Loop. By analogy, the District of Columbia may well become known sometime in the next millennium as the Beltway. POP GOES THE MARLIN</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT BUSH'S press secretary, the moon-faced Marlin Fitzwater, has brought a touch of class to the 1992 campaign. He has introduced poetic allusions to the daily press briefings.</p>
        <p>The White House press corps, which prides itself on a sandpapered-fingertip sensitivity to political arcana, has been struck dumb by this phenomenon. Nobody who has worked his or her razor-sharp elbows into the most coveted assignment in Washington has ever started on the poetry beat.</p>
        <p>Here is the White House closet intellectual's blast at those Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee who have disdained the President's economic plan: "weasels going into a hole."</p>
        <p>A member of the Poetic Allusion Watch (PAW) -- Sam Abrams at the Rochester Institute of Technology -- was among those who spotted Mr. Fitzwater's direct (if slightly inaccurate) allusion to "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen," a 1928 poem by William Butler Yeats:</p>
        <p>We pieced our thoughts into philosophy,</p>
        <p>And planned to bring the world under a rule,</p>
        <p>Who are but weasels fighting in a hole.</p>
        <p>The subtlety and aptness of Mr. Fitzwater's slouching towards Yeats are astonishing: the poet presages Mr. Bush's New World Order in his plan to bring the disorderly weasel-nations, down in the hole-arena, under the rule of international law. He did not, for obvious reasons, call attention to a later stanza:</p>
        <p>We, who seven years ago</p>
        <p>Talked of honor and of truth,</p>
        <p>Shriek with pleasure if we show</p>
        <p>The weasel's twist, the weasel's tooth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his staff are evidently planning to leap down in that weasel hole to get in the fight.</p>
        <p>Yeats is big these days on Madison Avenue, too. Dominique F. Nahas of New York calls my attention to the decision by R. J. Reynolds to switch ad agencies, a move that caused John L. Mezzina, whose fledgling agency got the account, to say that the Camel brand "is easier for a small agency because what tends to happen in any large organization is that the falcon can't hear the falconer."</p>
        <p>"The falcon cannot hear the falconer" is from "The Second Coming," in which Yeats refers to the wide sweeps that sometimes take the hunting bird beyond the call of the falconer. Coincidentally, it precedes a line that reflects a concern in the White House:</p>
        <p>Things fall apart; the center cannot hold. . . .</p>
        <p>The best lack all conviction, while the worst</p>
        <p>Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
