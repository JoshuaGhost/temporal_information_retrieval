        <p>Right-wingers backed by the military have now thwarted an international peace plan for Haiti, forcing the Organization of American States to contemplate stronger approaches to restoring democratic rule. In Venezuela, military nationalists challenge democracy. And Shining Path guerrillas terrorize Peru.</p>
        <p>The time has come to create a new inter-American military force that could intervene to protect democratic governments from hijacking by armed terrorists.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of Haitians favored O.A.S. efforts to restore their ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But an armed minority of soldiers and political thugs intimidated enough legislators to block final approval.</p>
        <p>Now O.A.S. members are likely to step up economic pressure. That will bring new suffering to impoverished Aristide supporters, but may not soften the hearts of soldiers who have profited handsomely from drugs and other illicit rackets.</p>
        <p>Nor will embargoes alone provide an answer to serious problems elsewhere in the hemisphere. Last month rebel soldiers nearly overthrew Venezuela's democratic Government. And in Peru, the violent Shining Path insurgency continues to gain ground, threatening the democratic regime. Peru's own army, notorious for human rights abuses, has proved ineffective and a danger to democracy itself. Meanwhile the possibility of backdoor U.S. intervention through drug interdiction rightly alarms Congress.</p>
        <p>The crises demand a Latin American version of the collective security arrangements now emerging in Europe, Africa and Asia.</p>
        <p>European mediators backed by U.N. peacekeepers are trying to end the deadly war between Serbs and Croats. Soldiers from a West African regional organization have helped restrain Liberia's civil war. And Indonesian and Malaysian forces are now moving into Cambodia as part of a U.N. peacekeeping plan. Outside intervention is no longer tantamount to big-power bullying.</p>
        <p>A hemispheric intervention force is more likely to be accepted if Washington maintains a low profile. The U.S., as the region's major military power, is uniquely suited to certain logistical and reconnaissance tasks. But political control of the force needs to be shared broadly.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the Haitian crisis, Argentina and Costa Rica seemed favorable to creating an inter-American force. With the region's militaries again becoming restive and Shining Path on the march, there's little time to lose.</p>
