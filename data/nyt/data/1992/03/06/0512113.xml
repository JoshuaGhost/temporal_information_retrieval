        <p>In the very recent past, most intellectual conservatives understood, named and fought against a political disease they called moral equivalency. Now a sad number of them are suddenly suffering from it.</p>
        <p>Moral equivalency is a disorder of that part of the mental process that governs ethical political thought and conduct. Those afflicted exhibit certain specific symptoms.</p>
        <p>They cannot discern the essential differences between political good and political evil when choices have to be made. They magnify the faults and complications of democracy and glaze over the horrors of tyranny.  They refuse to choose between freedom and oppression when the friends of freedom desperately need help.</p>
        <p>They accept from authoritarian or despotic governments acts of bigotry and human indecency against which they would crusade in a free society.</p>
        <p>This disorder led many Western liberals to equate the faults of capitalism with the villainies of Communism. It led them to decide that Moscow and Washington were equal threats to peace and liberty. At the moment, it leads the West to the bizarre conclusion that one democracy in the Middle East is a greater danger than the score or so dictatorships arrayed against it.</p>
        <p>Now, angry with President Bush's deviations from their vision of economic conservatism, and disgusted with his floundering, conservatives are shutting mouths and eyes to the danger embodied by Patrick Buchanan.</p>
        <p>That danger was put forward most plainly by that cool- and clear-minded columnist Charles Krauthammer. He wrote that Mr. Buchanan's combination of ugliness about immigrants, his fears for the future of "white Americans," his admiration of so many dictators, his contempt for democracy, his anti-Semitism, his adoption of the "America First" slogan so identified with Nazi apologists and now his Peronist denunciations of "vulture capitalism" summon up a word: fascistic.</p>
        <p>The sorrow of current American political life is that many conservatives, in their anger about Mr. Bush and the recession, are tolerating a man whose values dishonor them, their party and the country. That is moral equivalency in emergency-room form.</p>
        <p>Case example: The National Review, once the healthy pride of American conservative intellectualism, now is wan and pockmarked with the disease. It does not yet match The Nation, a carrier from the left, but it is getting too close.</p>
        <p>William Buckley, founder and president of The Review, wrote that Mr. Buchanan had said anti-Semitic things. Then he promptly backed a protest vote in New Hampshire for the man, stunning friends who thought they would never see the day.</p>
        <p>Now he says that since the protest point has been made in New Hampshire there is no use voting for Mr. Buchanan in other primaries. But the point his readers will remember is that Mr. Buckley believes Mr. Buchanan's mouthings acceptable enough to vote for him at least once.</p>
        <p>John O'Sullivan, The Review's current editor, goes further. He advises Republicans to keep supporting Mr. Buchanan until "a milli-second" before Mr. Buchanan himself decides to support Mr. Bush, "probably" early April. For Mr. O'Sullivan, this is the delicious part: that strategy would avoid blame if Mr. Bush loses the Presidency and also would install Mr. Buchanan as first among equals in the 1996 Republican contest. See?</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Sullivan hints that if Mr. Bush looks "seriously unelectable" during the primaries he should be dumped in favor of a third conservative. Sure -- and the Buchanan to whom the moral equivalizers gave the prize of respectability would then meekly step aside for somebody maybe a little more refined.</p>
        <p>I am sure that some of Mr. Buchanan's visceral viciousness must be distasteful to Mr. O'Sullivan, but he doesn't say so. Or am I really sure now?</p>
        <p>Many Americans who vote for Mr. Buchanan as a protest may not yet have figured through the lasting impact. But the politicians, commentators and intellectual conservatives who know Mr. Buchanan's record and still give him respectability, urge votes for him or even remain silent, these all have made their choice.</p>
        <p>Still, a cure exists for the moral equivalency that has stricken conservatives -- remembrance of times so recently past. To refuse it is a kind of intellectual suicide, a sin in itself.</p>
