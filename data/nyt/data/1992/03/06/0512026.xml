        <p>Oliver Stone's Quest</p>
        <p>"I think Congress deserves an Oscar."</p>
        <p>With those words, Oliver Stone reacted to assurances he said he received from members of Congress that resolutions would be introduced next week to open secret files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>In a scenario that might be titled "Mr. Stone Goes to Washington," the director of the controversial film "J. F. K." went to the capital this week to pursue his goal of ending the secrecy surrounding the 1963 slaying attributed to Lee Harvey Oswald by having the files opened.</p>
        <p>"If they do not open them immediately, then it is a travesty of democracy," said Mr. Stone, whose film earned eight Academy Award nominations, including those for best film and best director, while garnering considerable scorn from critics at odds with its argument that the assassination resulted from a conspiracy whose tentacles extended to the highest levels of the United States Government. "Do we have a democracy?" Mr. Stone asked. "If we do, the people should run their own Government and be told the truth of their own history."</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone said he had received assurances from both David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who is the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Representative Louis Stokes, the Ohio Democrat who was the chairman of the former House Select Committee on Assassinations, that the resolution to release all files pertaining to the assassination -- Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, military intelligence and the Secret Service -- would be ready by the middle of the next week.</p>
        <p>In reaction to the Academy Award kudos received by "J. F. K.," Mr. Stone said, "I'm very proud, because the film was so reviled in the press and in television, and because it comes from 5,000 colleagues, many of whom share the feeling -- even if they don't agree with everything I said -- that a vast lie was told us in 1963 by the Government and by the media."</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Mr. Stone said he didn't know what he might do next. "I have done seven movies in seven years," he noted. "This one has been a monster. I'm going to take a little hiatus." Likes Stories, Hates Scripts</p>
        <p>If there's one thing Shirley-Anne Field likes, it's a good story. After all, she's not only an English actress who has been in everything from "The Entertainer" and "Alfie" to "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "Shag"; she's also an author: of "A Time for Love," a memoir about finding her relatives in America.</p>
        <p>But while she enjoys a good story, she hates reading scripts.</p>
        <p>She was in Edinburgh in 1990 finishing what she calls an unhappy tour as Juliet's mother in "Romeo and Juliet" -- in which, she says, one actress coughed and cried over the other performers' lines and the best actor began drinking heavily -- when she received a call from her agents. "We've got this bloke coming on to us all the time wanting us to send this script to you," is the way she says she remembers the conversation.</p>
        <p>The script was eventually dispatched, and Miss Field, despite her reluctance, began to read. "It was so funny and joyous," she said. "I liked this so much and noticed that the man who was going to direct is also the writer." Back in London, she called him and told him, "I think your script is wonderful."</p>
        <p>The writer and director was Peter Chelsom, and the script, which he wrote with Adrian Dunbar, was "Hear My Song," the little comedy about a young impresario who has to hunt up a legendary and reclusive tenor in Ireland to redeem himself with his girlfriend and her mother, a former beauty queen, in England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chelsom insisted on meeting Miss Field for tea, an occasion that prompted him to mention that a number of actresses were pursuing the part of the mother.</p>
        <p>"Have you ever seen 'The Entertainer?' " Miss Field asked him. "I play the part of a beauty queen."</p>
        <p>Mr. Chelsom saw it that night, she said, and called her two days later. "Please don't worry," he said. "You're absolutely right for our film."</p>
        <p>Five days later, Miss Field was in Ireland rehearsing for the film, which has won enthusiastic reviews and charmed audiences. On Buster Keaton</p>
        <p>Buster Keaton will be playing the Ziegfeld when March 31 rolls around. He'll be sharing the bill with Vince Giordano and His Nighthawks Orchestra as the Film Forum stages two benefit screenings of Keaton's 1928 silent comedy "The Cameraman."</p>
        <p>Keaton plays a helpless tintype photographer whose love for a beautiful woman inspires him to undertake the more daring work of a newsreel cameraman, covering fires, parades, battleship launchings, regattas and a gang war in Chinatown in New York with varying results.</p>
        <p>The 11-piece Nighthawks Orchestra specializes in the music of the 1920's, and its score for "The Cameraman" is intended to capture the spirit of the Jazz Age, with its flappers, bootleg liquor and Ford flivvers.</p>
        <p>"The Cameraman" will be shown in a restored 35-millimeter print.</p>
        <p>Admission to the screenings, which benefits the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, Manhattan, is $35, or $25 for Film Forum members. Screenings are at 6:30 and 9 P.M. at the Ziegfeld, 141 West 54th Street, Manhattan. Tickets are available by mail only. For information, call (212) 627-2035 on weekdays.</p>
