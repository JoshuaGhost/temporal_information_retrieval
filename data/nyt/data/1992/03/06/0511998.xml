        <p>New Jersey officials said today that the Federal disaster aid promised this week by the Bush Administration to help repair damage that three coastal counties suffered in a January storm will insure that shore resorts are ready for the summer tourist season.</p>

        <p>New Jersey officials said today that the Federal disaster aid promised this week by the Bush Administration to help repair damage that three coastal counties suffered in a January storm will insure that shore resorts are ready for the summer tourist season.</p>
        <p>But they said they were disappointed that the Federal Government had reaffirmed its earlier denial of aid in the wake of a storm that struck the coast on Halloween, causing even more damage to beaches, boardwalks, homes and businesses than the one nine weeks later.</p>
        <p>At a news conference held by state and Federal officials, Scott A. Weiner, the New Jersey Commissioner of Environmental Protection and Energy, said he was "disappointed and surprised at the scope" of the disaster declaration, which did not cover Monmouth County, extending from Sandy Hook to the Manasquan Inlet.</p>
        <p>But by the time the 30-minute news conference ended, Stephen Kempf Jr., the director of the regional office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was able to erase most of the frowns from the faces of New Jersey officials.</p>
        <p>He explained that no aid was approved for the October storm, which officials said caused about $72 million in damage, "because repairs were not beyond the ability of state and local governments to manage."</p>
        <p>He said money was approved for the January storm because of new damage it caused and the "cumulative effect" it had on damage caused by the October storm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiner picked up the cumulative-effect idea and said the earlier storm would be included by reference in detailed studies of beachfront damage that are to begin immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kempf said the preliminary estimate of $4.2 million for the eligible damage in Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May Counties would not limit the amount of money to be spent.  "There is no cap on the amount we will spend to make needed repairs," he said. "This is not a wish list or a gift list, but the fact is there is no limit on the amount of aid." Additional Information</p>
        <p>He also said that mayors who believed their Monmouth County towns had sustained damage that would qualify for aid should submit new requests with additional information, even though Federal inspectors did not recommend aid for them immediately after the storms.</p>
        <p>Officials of several Monmouth towns sharply criticized their exclusion from the disaster declaration before today's news conference.</p>
        <p>Mayor Kenneth Pringle of Belmar said in an interview that damage to the sea wall at the borough's border with neighboring Spring Lake had caused part of a roadway to collapse on the 16-inch main that carries all of the municipality's raw sewage to a treatment plant in Wall Township.</p>
        <p>"If that pipe breaks, we will have an environmental disaster that would dwarf the ocean pollution problems of 1987 and 1988," he said. Repair estimates, he said, range from $350,000 to almost $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kempf, saying he had been unaware of the threat to the sewer line, urged Mayor Pringle to submit a new application for assistance.</p>
        <p>Maj. Carl A. Williams of the New Jersey state police, deputy director of the State Office of Emergency Management, said at the news conference that an office would be opened by Tuesday to help counties and towns prepare applications, which must be filed within 30 days of the disaster declaration made on March 3.</p>
        <p>Mayor Charles Rooney of Sea Bright said in an interview that he could not understand the refusal of Federal inspectors to put the town's sea wall on the list of approved projects.</p>
        <p>"They're blind," he said. "We got big holes in the west side of the wall from the storms. This town is vulnerable, and we're the entrance to Gateway National Park on Sandy Hook, the third most popular park in the country with 2.6 million visitors annually. If we go, the park will be cut off and Highlands Borough will be threatened."</p>
        <p>In addition to the new Federal aid, New Jersey has appropriated $4.2 million for repairs, and Mr. Weiner, the New Jersey Commissioner, said some of the money should qualify as matching funds for Federal aid. The Federal Government will pay 75 percent of the cost of repairs, with state and local governments putting up 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Federal officials said $4.8 million in flood insurance claims had been paid thus far to New Jersey residents.</p>
