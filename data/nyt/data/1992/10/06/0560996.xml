        <p>The Pittsburgh Penguins confirmed today what Mario Lemieux had made known last week: that he had signed a new seven-year contract.</p>
        <p>The financial terms of the pact weren't revealed, but no one denied the figure of $42 million, which Lemieux had given last week in an interview with a Montreal radio station. That would make him the National Hockey League's highest-paid player.</p>

        <p>The Pittsburgh Penguins confirmed today what Mario Lemieux had made known last week: that he had signed a new seven-year contract.</p>
        <p>The financial terms of the pact weren't revealed, but no one denied the figure of $42 million, which Lemieux had given last week in an interview with a Montreal radio station. That would make him the National Hockey League's highest-paid player.</p>
        <p>Another important announcement by the Penguins is expected on Tuesday morning, just hours before the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions will open their N.H.L. season with a game here at the Civic Arena against Eric Lindros and the Philadelphia Flyers. That announcement will concern who will coach Pittsburgh this season.</p>
        <p>Scotty Bowman, who coached the Penguins last season, has been unable so far to come to an agreement with Craig Patrick, the general manager. Either Bowman or Patrick is likely to be behind the bench for the opening game. Birthday Bonus</p>
        <p>Lemieux's contract was announced on his 27th birthday during a news conference here at a downtown hotel.</p>
        <p>"It's a great birthday," said Lemieux, who also mentioned that he is engaged to be married next June.  "Loyalty is a three-way street," said Howard Baldwin, the Penguins' owner, who said he was alluding to the players, team management and fans. The owner said that "it would be hard to look the fans in the eye" if he raised ticket prices and failed to keep the league's best player.</p>
        <p>Tom Reich, Lemieux's agent, said Lemieux had two years left on his previous contract and had no intention of renegotiating until the Penguins approached him shortly before the playoffs last spring.</p>
        <p>Chronic back problems limited Lemieux to 64, 26 and 59 games over the last three regular seasons. But at the news conference, he said: "My back is in great shape -- I've played golf everyday this summer and I didn't have a problem."</p>
        <p>Because Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings is out indefinitely with back problems this season, Lemieux will be even more outspoken about hockey matters, he said today.</p>
        <p>"Somebody has to pick up the slack," said Lemieux, who in the past has criticized violent play. "Somebody has to step in and show some leadership. Part of my life will be to get more involved and voice my opinion. Certainly, I intend to do that."</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>High-Sticking Rule Approved</p>
        <p>(By The Associated Press) -- The N.H.L. governors voted yesterday to adopt a rule change lowering the threshold for high-sticking, making it illegal to make contact above an opponent's waist instead of above the shoulders.</p>
        <p>The rule change, given tentative approval at the governors' Aug. 25 meeting in St. Petersburg, Fla., was enforced during the preseason.</p>
        <p>The N.H.L. did not disclose a breakdown of the vote, which was conducted by fax.</p>
