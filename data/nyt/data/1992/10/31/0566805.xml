        <p>If county legislators have their way, Suffolk homeowners will get a 2.3 percent cut in their property taxes next year, instead of the 20 percent increase proposed by County Executive Robert J. Gaffney.</p>
        <p>The legislators completed work early today on a series of amendments that would more than balance Mr. Gaffney's $1.5 billion budget for 1993. The changes would provide tax savings and additional revenues while restoring some county jobs and even creating a few new ones.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gaffney, after reviewing the amendment package, said today that "it was not real" and that more than half the proposed changes were "patently illegal."</p>
        <p>"And if they're illegal, there's no doubt that I'll veto them." he said.  "Those that have merit, I'm willing to consider."</p>
        <p>He predicted that when all is said and done, the outcome will be closer to his projected 20 percent tax increase than to any reduction. In the meantime, though, those members of the legislature who are running for higher office in Tuesday's general election can continue to say that they are against raising taxes.  'Mean but Honest'</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gaffney's fiscal plan, which he describes as "mean but honest," the average property tax bill would increase by $111 next year.  Under the package of amendments approved by the legislators in a vote of 11 to 7, property owners would receive, on average, a $15 reduction.  Twelve votes would be required to override a veto by the County Executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said that some of the cost-cutting and revenue-producing measures violate various laws, including the state's Taylor Law regarding public employees, and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He said that many of the legislators were no doubt unaware of the legal problems since they did not have enough time to have the amendment package reviewed by legal counsel.</p>
        <p>Among the items in question is a two-week payroll delay for 10,000 county employees that would save $11.8 million, and a cut in longevity pay funds for county workers saving $8.5 million, both of which would require union approval.</p>
        <p>Among the critics on the Legislature was Michael D. O'Donohoe, a Conservative, who described $27 million of the $70 million in cuts in the package as "fairy tales" and said they meant "picking the taxpayers' pocket one way or another." Concern Over Taxes</p>
        <p>He said that by raising fees or passing costs on to the towns, taxpayers were still being forced to pay. "No matter what you call it or how you do it, it's still a tax increase," he said.</p>
        <p>"I feel like a one-legged man walking on the rim of the Grand Canyon," he told his fellow lawmakers. "Let's get real."</p>
        <p>The presiding officer, Donald R. Blydenburgh, who sponsored the Republican omnibus package, angrily dismissed critics and insisted that the budget amendments would help overhaul county government.</p>
        <p>"This is a very rational action that sets policy," said Mr. Blydenburgh, challenging Mr. Gaffney's role as Republican Party leader. "I, for one, don't want to keep raising taxes."</p>
        <p>The legislators began working on the package and a long list of other amendments around noon Thursday and finished shortly after midnight.</p>
        <p>The process was prolonged by a series of 15-minute adjournments that stretched to an hour or more as both Republicans and Democrats caucused behind closed doors, traded votes and, for the most part, remained talking without rancor.</p>
        <p>There was one brief impassioned outbreak of rhetorical mid-session fireworks when Mr. Blydenburgh and Mr. O'Donohoe lectured each another on political patronage and accused each other of handing out jobs to friends and family. The argument ended when the other members forced an hourlong recess.</p>
        <p>Democrats managed to remove portions of the omnibus measure that would have restored several political appointments cut by Mr. Gaffney. Legislator Sondra M. Bachety, leader of the Democratic caucus, said she agreed with Mr. Gaffney on the cuts and could not understand why his own party was fighting him.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, 55 people scheduled to be laid off by Mr. Gaffney next year would be retained under the amending resolutions, including 40 politically sensitive positions at the Board of Elections.</p>
        <p>The legislators also voted to create 21 new jobs, including a new deputy police commissioner to handle minority issues. They also approved the use of $5 million from new sales tax revenues to hire 194 police officers next year, in addition to the 300 officers budgeted by Mr. Gaffney.</p>
        <p>During a brief change of pace at 6 P.M. Thursday, the legislators put budget matters aside and confirmed the appointment of Peter F. Cosgrove as the county's third police commissioner in six months. The vote was 13 to 5, with one abstention.</p>
        <p>Like his two predecessors, who left amid disputes over budgeting and departmental reorganization, Mr. Cosgrove is faced with a shrinking budget and the loss of several hundred officers who have chosen to retire rather than face the possible loss of pension benefits.</p>
