        <p>The Giants' starting left cornerback against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday will probably be Reyna Thompson. It will not be Mark Collins unless he makes a miraculous recovery. It will not be Phillippi Sparks because the rookie is not ready, and it will not be Everson Walls because he seems to be in the doghouse.</p>
        <p>When Collins sprained his left ankle during Sunday's 31-21 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals, Thompson replaced him. Thompson and Walls played as usual in the nickel defense (five defensive backs), and Sparks joined those five in the dime defense (six defensive backs).</p>
        <p>Today, when the Giants practiced in the rain, Thompson was the starter. Collins, with his ankle less swollen than earlier in the week, ran a bit, but did not practice. He will try to practice Thursday, but he was listed as doubtful for Sunday. Defining Walls's Role</p>
        <p>Walls had been the first backup until the Cardinals' game. Today, Coach Ray Handley said Sparks would move up to the nickel defense and Walls would be the backup safety and the fourth cornerback. He said Walls would play when the team employs the dime defense but not the nickel.</p>
        <p>Walls's demotion continues a season of decline. In training camp, he lost his starting job at right cornerback to Perry Williams. In the second game of the season, he moved ahead of the inexperienced Lamar McGriggs at strong safety, but after two games McGriggs got the job back because he was more aggressive and a better tackler.</p>
        <p>"It's tough emotionally," Walls said. "But my teammates keep my morale up, even though I have a limited role in this defense. But it's an active role because I play in the nickel and dime. Nickel and dime -- sounds demeaning, doesn't it?"</p>
        <p>Walls is obviously being phased out.</p>
        <p>"It seems like that to me," he said. "I would start me. I thought I was next in line at corner, but you can't assume anything around here."</p>
        <p>Thompson said he assumed nothing.</p>
        <p>"You have to take things as they happen," he said. "Hopefully, I've already shown the coaches what I can do. When Mark was hurt, I really didn't know what would happen. But when they tell you to go in, you go in."</p>
        <p>In 1990, when Collins sprained an ankle, Thompson started four games at left cornerback. But his defensive work has generally been limited to nickel and dime defenses. Madden Is a Booster</p>
        <p>He is better known as a special-teams player, the best ever according to John Madden, the broadcaster and former coach.</p>
        <p>If Thompson plays cornerback, the Rams may test him with Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson, their veteran speed receivers.</p>
        <p>"Collins has always played us tough," said Jim Everett, the Rams' quarterback, by telephone. "If he's not there, you might look around and see who's back there and what you can do."</p>
        <p>Because the Giants had aging cornerbacks, they drafted Sparks this year on the second round. He has made progress toward becoming a starting cornerback later this year. Happy With the News</p>
        <p>"He's working toward that," Handley said.</p>
        <p>Sparks said he was glad to hear that.</p>
        <p>"I hope I can start," he said. "So far, things are going pretty good, but you can't get excited. They hit one deep on you and score and where are you? On Sunday, I said, 'Lord, just let me do what I'm capable of doing.' And I did that."</p>
        <p>Because the Cardinals generally used three wide receivers and were often forced to pass, the Giants lined up six defensive backs on 15 or 20 of the Cardinals' 58 offensive plays.</p>
        <p>"I thought I did O.K.," Sparks said, "nothing out of the ordinary, just what we did in practice. They prepared us for that, and it felt good. I've just been waiting for the opportunity."</p>
        <p>Although Sparks talks of that game calmly, he was hardly calm Sunday. According to Pepper Johnson, the Giants' inside linebacker, the first time Sparks ran onto the field, he said excitedly, "Pepper, I'm out here now."</p>
        <p>Sparks was out there in strange shoes. He had run out of his own, and an equipment man came up with a pair.</p>
        <p>"I have my own now," Sparks said. "I'm taking Sunday's shoes home and keeping them as a souvenir."  FOOTBALL</p>
