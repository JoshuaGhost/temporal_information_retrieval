        <p>The Meat Market  The Inside Story of the N.F.L. Draft  By Richard Whittingham  Illustrated. 214 pages. Macmillan. $20.</p>
        <p>To be afflicted with a rooting interest in a professional football team inevitably leads to an even more bizarre obsession with the process by which your team acquires its players. That is why every April many grown-up Americans sit in front of their telephones and television sets for two consecutive days while 336 names are announced at intervals from the stage of some Manhattan ballroom. This is the annual draft of college football players, a ritual that must be as fascinating to outsiders as watching liquid being drawn up through a straw. Yet for serious pro football fans, happiness is at stake.</p>

        <p>To be afflicted with a rooting interest in a professional football team inevitably leads to an even more bizarre obsession with the process by which your team acquires its players. That is why every April many grown-up Americans sit in front of their telephones and television sets for two consecutive days while 336 names are announced at intervals from the stage of some Manhattan ballroom. This is the annual draft of college football players, a ritual that must be as fascinating to outsiders as watching liquid being drawn up through a straw. Yet for serious pro football fans, happiness is at stake.</p>
        <p>"The Meat Market: The Inside Story of the N.F.L. Draft," by Richard Whittingham, is the first book I know of that describes the football draft from a team's point of view. In 1991, the Chicago Bears gave Mr. Whittingham, a veteran sportswriter, the rare opportunity to spend the week leading up to the draft with the team's front office staff. This was the year that nearly the entire first round hinged on whether the New England Patriots would draft the Notre Dame star Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, and that Mr. Ismail threw everyone's plans askew by signing for some $20 million with the Toronto Argonauts, of the Canadian Football League.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Whittingham reveals about the process is not entirely cosmic. He discreetly withholds the more colorful gossip that must surely have flown about. He describes an arduous process of winnowing that selects from more than 4,500 college players the 336 who will be chosen in the draft. Even with all the grinding work -- the traveling, observing, measuring, interviewing, analyzing, comparing and report writing -- the process of judging is inexact. Of the 336 chosen, only 130 or so survived the teams' final cuts the following September, and of these only some 30 started. Who the best of these turned out to be often had little to do with the order in which they were chosen.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Whittingham's most diverting stories involve the surprises that have developed over the years. For instance in 1957 the Cleveland Browns, disappointed not to have had a crack at any of three quarterbacks they coveted, were forced to settle for "this kid from Syracuse, Jim Brown," who turned out to be one of the greatest running backs in pro football history. Of course, there was more opportunity for surprise in the early days of the draft. Wellington Mara, an owner of the New York Giants, used to flip through publications like Street &amp; Smith's Yearbook, a distant cry from the body-fat quantification and motivation research that obtains these days. He was successful at it too, at least for a time.  And while the owners and coaches mulled over their choices, Jimmy Conzelman, the coach of the Chicago Cardinals, would go over to the piano in the hotel conference room and entertain the gathering by tickling the keys.</p>
        <p>One shortcoming of "The Meat Market" is that its focus is a little narrow. Starting his narrative so close to the actual draft, the author leaves himself no space to go back and watch the players from the class of 1991 develop over the years and assume the individuality that might allow us to take some interest in their personal stories. He calls them meat and he treats them as meat.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the process, he surveys the results of the draft too soon. History suggests that it takes at least five years to judge the vintage of a given harvest. First-round players who fell flat their rookie years, like Jarrod Bunch of the Giants, may yet turn out to be fine wine, or so one fervently prays. Ricky Watters of the San Francisco 49ers, a third-round pick who hardly played his rookie year, is now beginning to look like at least a second growth.</p>
        <p>Despite the muckraking sound of its title, "The Meat Market" never questions the financial or ethical propriety of the draft. You wouldn't know from the book that the process is now under legal challenge for restricting the freedom of players to sell their services where they wish. There is even a chapter on the N.F.L.'s Plan B, a modified free-agent system that was all but declared illegal in a recent court decision. The only criticism of Plan B that Mr. Whittingham mentions is that of a Chicago Bear executive who doesn't like it because "it breeds soldiers of fortune, or mercenaries" and fails to promote "loyalty."</p>
        <p>The book does offer some perspective on the draft by tracing the history of player acquisition from the beginning of professional football. In the early years, some teams did consistently well while others persisted in losing. So the draft was introduced in 1936 and from then on greater parity prevailed, although the cleverer teams continued to win more than their share of championships.</p>
        <p>Would parity fade if the draft were killed? Baseball, with its partial system of free agency, has shown that mixing the right players means more than buying the biggest stars. And the chemistry of football, with its closely coordinated movements, is even more delicate than that of baseball.  So some system of drafting talent will probably be worked out between the players and the owners, even when free agency is allowed.</p>
        <p>Besides, it would be a shame to deprive fans of the draft. Following it is one of the great indoor sports, so obsessing to people of a certain sedentary temperament as to make even a lackluster book like "The Meat Market" seem necessary, even compulsory, reading.</p>
