        <p>It was late, just out of Grand Central, the last train to New Haven. The conductor did not seem to notice the 40-ounce beer bottle rolling at the feet of three teen-agers. He politely coaxed the fare from a young Wall Streeter, who was beyond drunk and perhaps for the first time in his life unable to manipulate money.</p>
        <p>"Where is your wallet?" the conductor said loudly, the way people speak to children and foreigners. "Sir, your wallet!"</p>

        <p>It was late, just out of Grand Central, the last train to New Haven. The conductor did not seem to notice the 40-ounce beer bottle rolling at the feet of three teen-agers. He politely coaxed the fare from a young Wall Streeter, who was beyond drunk and perhaps for the first time in his life unable to manipulate money.</p>
        <p>"Where is your wallet?" the conductor said loudly, the way people speak to children and foreigners. "Sir, your wallet!"</p>
        <p>Two hours later, at 3:38 A.M. at the end of the line, the conductor walked through six cars littered with a collection of commuter refuse peculiar to late-night trains from New York to suburbia: one pair of black pumps, an empty bottle of 1990 Chardonnay, a puddle of vomit covered by a checked handkerchief. Uniformity Gives Way</p>
        <p>The 1:30 to New Haven is not quite a rolling drunk tank. But as on other late trains out of the city, the dull daytime uniformity of blue suits, dress skirts and rustling newspapers becomes something chattier, ruder and decidedly less staid. Late-night partyers sit next to weary-eyed business executives, who sit next to late-shift workers, who sit next to people who try to avoid other people who normally do not make a morning commute.</p>
        <p>On one recent trip, Jonathan Falk, a 36-year-old economist from Rye, N.Y., ooked warily at a young man in a red sweater making a boozy, sort-of pass at a 24-year-old advertising buyer in the next seat. The young man was not quite offensive, and Mr. Falk, both concerned and amused, said the scene was typical.</p>
        <p>"I love this train," he said. "In the morning there is no interaction. In the evening before midnight there is no interaction. On the 1:30 train there is always something going on."</p>
        <p>Despite an occasional carnival atmosphere that makes some riders uneasy, the last train is not especially dangerous. During the last two years, there have been only a handful of incidents, most minor. The most recent was an armed robbery last month during which a gun went off on the train but did not injure anyone. The gumnan escaped and has not been arrested.</p>
        <p>Metro-North officials say, as do Long Island Rail Road officials, that the late trains are generally not too rowdy, except after concerts, big sporting events or special occasions like the St. Patrick's Day Parade.</p>
        <p>Rather, the train's on-the-edge allure rests in a certain casualness. There are 113 red and blue seats in each of six cars, but they are rarely full, either when they pull out of Grand Central Terminal or arrive in New Haven 27 stops later.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Thompson, a 34-year-old hotel worker, likes the train because he can drink an after-work beer in relative peace. One man felt comfortable paying his $4 fare in dimes, nickels and pennies jammed into a cigarette box. Others slept, slumped across the seats, trusting the conductors to yell out when their stop arrived.  Quirky Behavior</p>
        <p>"You get to know the characters," said Steve Lichty, 29, who even at 2:30 A.M. looked every inch the banker he is. "There is this guy we call Antiseptic Man who literally takes out a bottle of alcohol and cleans the entire seat before he sits down."</p>
        <p>"Then there is Rib Man," said Mr. Richty, who often works late. "Rib Man always has a little red plastic bag that you get in Chinatown. He eats ribs and then throws the bones on the floor. Then he walks around."</p>
        <p>Casey Shain, a 35-year-old art director from Guilford, Conn., has noticed something else.</p>
        <p>"There is a lot of, like, uh, sex, really," he said on a trip two weeks ago. (Two passengers, who claimed first-hand knowledge, confirmed this on a later trip.) "People are kind of bold. And for every bold one, there is an oblivious one."</p>
        <p>Mr. Shain, who works at a Manhattan electronics magazine, is something of an expert on the last train to Connecticut. He takes the late train, usually three times a week, by choice and he is working on a book about the oddities he has seen over the years.</p>
        <p>"I'd rather see this bunch of deadbeats than upper-middle-class scummy yuppies desperately trying to beat each other up," said Mr. Shain, whose five-hour daily commute means most of his social life takes place on the New Haven line. "They are just more interesting than the people who wear the same raincoats and the same shoes and all get into Volvos."</p>
        <p>At 1:30 last Saturday morning, the train left from Track 21 in a Grand Central Terminal that was still and empty, save for the late-night commuters, a few homeless people and 47 people from Montclair, N.J., touring the station. ("There are restrooms under that archway," said 81-year-old Howard Fox, the tour guide. "You can try them if you want to." There were no takers. Despite some confusion, no one accidentally boarded the train to Connecticut.  A Typical Crowd</p>
        <p>The train began to fill up with a typical crowd: the three teen-agers returning to Larchmont, N.Y., after not getting into a bar; a couple going home to West Haven after a Frank Sinatra and Shirley MacLaine concert.</p>
        <p>Joe Tiano, a 30-year-old machinist from New Haven, had just spent an evening around Times Square. He was not happy about spending the next two hours and eight minutes cut off from his two sources of bliss.</p>
        <p>"You can't smoke on it," Mr. Tiano said. "That bothers me a lot. And they don't have bar cars, which is against my religion. I need my bar cars and I need my cigarettes." Mr. Tiano fell asleep promptly.</p>
        <p>"Local train to New Haven," came blaring from the public address system. "Making all local stops."</p>
        <p>One of two conductors, Bruce Berthel, 42, a 20-year railroad worker, said that the train has been quieter recently, mostly because of the two Metro-North police officers who have been patrolling the train more regularly since the robbery last month. But, he said, the 1:30 has the worst reputation on the New Haven line by far.</p>
        <p>"You can have trouble on any train," he said. "But it's just due to the fact of the time of night and that there are probably more drunks on here." A Mostly Quiet Trip</p>
        <p>In fact the train was mostly quiet as it chugged north, stopping at a station every five minutes or so. Five largish teen-agers whooped for a while. One couple got quite cozy. Some people drank beer, others slept. Someone threw up on the floor, but this being Connecticut, it was done discreetly.</p>
        <p>In the great tradition of the late-night train, Steve Gillespie, 22, who had been stranded at a bar in Westchester, struck up a conversation with Gary Grider, 23, and his girlfriend, Aimee Byrd, 21. Mr. Grider, who is from Kansas City, Mo., has the long blond hair and permanent sunglasses to prove he is in a rock band.</p>
        <p>It was his first last train to New Haven. In fact, it was his first train ride since kindergarten. He fit right in.</p>
        <p>"We're not in Kansas anymore," he said. "I'm going to click my heels," he added with Dorothy-like daintiness, hoisting up his black cowboy boots, "and I'm going to be in a big pile of beer."</p>
