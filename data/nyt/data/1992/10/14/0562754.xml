        <p>Apparently profiting from a marketing gamble in the second quarter, the Sprint Corporation yesterday reported a 13.2 percent rise in third-quarter earnings.</p>
        <p>The nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company said profits of $109.6 million, or 49 cents a share, were up 13 percent from $96.8 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. It said revenues grew 5.3 percent, to $2.33 billion from $2.21 billion.</p>

        <p>Apparently profiting from a marketing gamble in the second quarter, the Sprint Corporation yesterday reported a 13.2 percent rise in third-quarter earnings.</p>
        <p>The nation's third-largest long-distance telephone company said profits of $109.6 million, or 49 cents a share, were up 13 percent from $96.8 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. It said revenues grew 5.3 percent, to $2.33 billion from $2.21 billion.</p>
        <p>Sprint spent heavily to promote new products in the second quarter, when profit had risen only 5.6 percent from the year before. It promoted its Foncard, a calling card with added information services; the Most, a discount program on calls to customers' most frequently called parties, and Business Clout, a discount program aimed at small businesses. Help From Refinancings</p>
        <p>The company was also aided in the third quarter by lower interest costs because it refinanced debt to take advantage of lower rates. It was also helped by a strong performance from its local-telephone operations, which are in areas less hurt by the recession and where there is relatively favorable state regulation.</p>
        <p>Sprint shares gained 75 cents each on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $25.</p>
        <p>Sprint's earnings exceeded Wall Street projections by a relatively wide margin. Most analysts expected earnings of around 47 cents a share, while Sprint reported operating earnings before a one-time extraordinary charge of 52 cents a share, or $5.6 million, for early retirement of high-interest bonds.</p>
        <p>William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman and chief executive, said the company had increased its advertising and marketing budget by $28 million to lift consumer interest in the three new products. Advertising typically covers high-cost television ads and marketing covers one-time incentives to customers.</p>
        <p>"Candice Bergen has been an excellent spokeswoman for us; all of our market surveys tell us," said Mr. Esrey of the company's commercial spokeswoman. "But clearly, people like our products, too." Some Skepticism</p>
        <p>But Frank J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst with the First Boston Corporation, was skeptical. "They still haven't proved themselves," he said. "The point is not that they did well in the third quarter, which they did, but whether the growth is sustainable."</p>
        <p>Mr. Governali expects fourth-quarter earnings of 47 cents a share, with $1.87 a share for the full year. He expects 1993 earnings of only $1.70 a share, recently revised down from $2.05. Mr. Governali expects Sprint's merger, announced earlier this year, with the Centel Corporation, a large cellular and local-telephone company in Illinois, to be completed next year and to result in a large dilution of earnings.</p>
        <p>Several large shareholders oppose the merger plan. Pending clearance of Sprint and Centel proxies by the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholder meetings for a showdown vote might be held in December or early 1993. Rise in Traffic</p>
        <p>Sprint also posted an unusually strong rise in telephone traffic in the third quarter, saying that long-distance minutes grew 3.2 percent over the second quarter, and 6.9 percent over the third quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Governali expects that traffic at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the largest long-distance carrier, rose less than 2 percent in the third quarter over the second, and that that of the MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest carrier, rose 2.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Both companies are expected to report earnings in the next week.</p>
