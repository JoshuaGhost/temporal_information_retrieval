        <p>For the next year or so, he will be one of the most powerful members of Gov. Jim Florio's cabinet, overseeing a billion dollars worth of public and private projects in an effort to bring jobs to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>What makes Robert E. Hughey's appointment particularly interesting is that the Democratic Governor has chosen a Republican to try to stimulate economic growth while Republicans and Democrats, locally and nationally, are blaming each other for the depressed state of the economy.</p>
        <p>In fact, three years ago Mr. Hughey was working to keep Mr. Florio out of the Governor's mansion. He was the manager of State Senator William L. Gormley's unsuccessful bid to be Republican candidate for governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio went on to win the general election, and Mr. Hughey returned to private life as an investment banker and planning consultant. Instantly, 'the Jobs Czar'</p>
        <p>But this month, Mr. Hughey's career took another turn. Amid considerable bipartisan hoopla, the 49-year-old Mr. Hughey became Mr. Florio's Chief of Economic Recovery, a new, cabinet-level job that instantly became known as "the jobs czar."</p>
        <p>In Trenton, where bipartisan cooperation is rare, the appointment was greeted like a coronation. Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a fervent Republican who rarely praises anything done by the Democratic Governor, joined Mr. Florio at the announcement to say that "both Democrats and Republicans want to get New Jersey moving again and we are willing to do whatever it takes to do it."</p>
        <p>"We are here together to show that the good of New Jersey always comes first," Mr. Haytaian said. "This cabinet-level positon will have real power and Bob Hughey will have the tools he needs to get the job done."</p>
        <p>And Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, who is also a Republican, said, "I cannot think of any greater priority for this administration than the development of opportunities for business to flourish and jobs to be created." Cutting Through Bickering</p>
        <p>Governor Florio said he hoped Mr. Hughey would use the new post to bring jobs to New Jersey, where the unemployment rate is nudging 10 percent. "We can't afford to tie up a single dollar in delays and red tape, and we can't afford to waste a single minute on political bickering."</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, Mr. Hughey described his new role as that of "a super-coordinator," to make sure that all the pieces of job-producing projects, from publicly financed convention centers to private high-tech industry and everything in between, are in place, and if they are not, to put them in place.</p>
        <p>The main duty of "the Chief," as Mr. Florio refers to Mr. Hughey, "will be to identify viable job-creating projects, identify resources that can be pooled for economic development, cut red tape for existing or proposed projects, and secure private-sector financing," the Governor's statement said.</p>
        <p>How to do that, said Mr. Hughey in the interview just off the Governor's office -- he is still two weeks away from getting an office of his own, or a staff from other agencies -- exists only in outline. 'Help Find the Pieces'</p>
        <p>He said: "We are going to meet today, for example, with the state Chamber of Commerce and say what we have already said to the state department heads concerned with public projects, and that is if you have a project under way and if it is close to realization and you have everything in place to build the project, except for one or two things, then bring it to us and tell us about it, and we will help find the pieces."</p>
        <p>He is also charged with looking at the projects of state and bistate authorities like the Turnpike Authority, N.J. Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey Building Authority, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and relatively more recent undertakings like the Urban Development Corporaton and the Urban Enterprise Zone Authority and projects to renew aging water, sewer and other parts of the urban infrastructure.</p>
        <p>He will not create new projects, but help existing ones. "New Jersey already has an infrastructure trust program in place, not just for highways, but for water supplies and sewers," he said. "So unlike other states that are just getting under way on this sort of thing, we also have a broadly based funding power." New Jersey's taxes are supplemented by many public authorities that collect tolls, casino revenues and the like. 'A One-Year Coordinator'</p>
        <p>"So the next next logical step is how do we make them work together?" he continued. "Really what I am is a one-year coordinator; it is assumed that I will have it done in a year. All the authorities coordinated and the creations of jobs in a one-year period, when we most need them."</p>
        <p>As an investment banker who is also an urban planner -- and as head of the New Jersey Environmental Protection Department for four years under Gov. Thomas H. Kean -- Mr. Hughey brings a resume to his job that Mr. Florio says is tailor made to negotiate credit lines for public and private projects and to balance environmental considerations with job creation.</p>
        <p>"It is impossible not to be impressed with Bob Hughey," Mr. Florio said in an interview today. "I worked with him on environmental matters when I was in Congress and he has the skills and ablities I wanted, a balanced, no-nonsense ability to put the pieces together. It is the interaction among agencies that is important, cross-cutting across the agencies and the private sector."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio said that no one should fear that one of his jobs would be to skirt environmental regulations. "Anyone who thinks you have to sacrifice the environment to create jobs is erroneous," he said. "I don't share that belief, and neither does Bob Hughey. No, no one is going to short-circuit environmental regulations. Most people sign onto the proposition that there should be a balance." Jeep and Shirtsleeves</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughey has a reputation for informality -- he drove a Jeep to cabinet meetings at the Governor's mansion when he worked for Mr. Kean and often arrived in shirtsleeves -- as well as for an amiable but often blunt approach to problem solving.</p>
        <p>With the New Jersey economy stagnant -- the loss of 330,000 jobs in the last three years has wiped out much of the gains in the '80's -- he says he will use the same approach in his new job, which pays $100,225, a cabinet salary.</p>
        <p>There will be few meetings, he said, but a lot of faxes and telephone calls. "If I met with just the principal players, the authority heads and the cabinet officers, if I actually sat down and had a quality meeting with all those people and tried to understand what they were working on, that alone would wipe out a month and a half of this job, and I don't have time to do that, and I'm not going to," he said.</p>
        <p>"But what we are going to do with everyone involved is say, 'What's close, what can be done now, and how can we do it?' Initially, people will think I am rude. I mean, I don't want to just have nice meetings."</p>
