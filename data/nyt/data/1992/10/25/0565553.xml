        <p>After more than a year of savage warfare in the former Yugoslavia, diplomats and United Nations officials say they now see growing signs of an accord between Serbs and Croats, the two strongest ethnic groups in the region.</p>
        <p>Senior Serbian and Croatian officials have begun quietly negotiating to improve relations, these envoys say, and the talks have already produced concrete results, including prisoner exchanges, opening of the Belgrade-to-Zagreb highway and withdrawal of Serbian troops from a peninsula on Croatian territory.</p>
        <p>"There's no doubt in my mind that in terms of Serb-Croat relations, there has been a big improvement," said Cedric Thornberry, the senior civilian official in the United Nations Protection Force here. "I feel an extremely qualified optimism. A lot of people are now sufficiently chastened by the experiences they have gone through that they are beginning to look for a more constructive way."</p>
        <p>The armies of Croatia and of Yugoslavia, which is dominated by Serbia, have not clashed with each other in recent months, but their proxy militias have been engaged in sporadic battles. Hostility between the two nations has been intense, though, largely because Yugoslav-backed Serbian forces still occupy about one-third of Croatian territory, which they captured last year.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what effect the improved relations between Serbs and Croats will have on Bosnian Muslims, who constitute the weakest of this region's three major ethnic groups. Serbian and Croatian forces occupy large parts of Bosnia, and some Muslims here fear that Serbian and Croatian leaders are secretly plotting to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina and divide it between them, though European leaders and United Nations officials vow they will not tolerate that.</p>
        <p>The military commander of United Nations troops here, Lieut. Gen. Satish Nambiar, agreed with Mr. Thornberry's assessment. "Both Governments, the Government in Belgrade and the Government here in Zagreb, are making every effort to narrow down their differences and to reduce the scale of tensions that now exists," General Nambiar said on Friday. Lives Threatened Anyway</p>
        <p>While this rapprochement suggests the possibility of a breakthrough that could end at least some of the fighting, however, it does not hold any prospect of a quick return to normal life here. Even if a cease-fire were to be reached in the coming weeks, it could be too late to save the lives of thousands of people facing the onset of winter in refugee camps and besieged cities.</p>
        <p>Political developments in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and in Belgrade, capital of Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia, have made the new cooperation possible. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia won an electoral mandate in August, and soon afterward began to distance himself from extreme nationalists. Even more significantly, President Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia -- the remnant of the old federation, which is dominated by Serbia -- apparently decided to break with the most militant Serbian nationalists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cosic attended the peace conference in August in London, and participants said he seemed stunned at the intense anger directed toward the Belgrade Government.</p>
        <p>"Before London, I don't think Cosic realized how bad his international position was," said one European ambassador. "It was a shock for him. He was white in the face during the whole conference."</p>
        <p>Returning to Belgrade, Mr. Cosic appears to have decided to break with the Serbian strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, a hard-line nationalist whose tough policies are widely regarded to be at the heart of the Balkan war. President Cosic, a nationalist who commands considerable respect within the army and the police, has begun supporting the more moderate policies of Prime Minister Milan Panic, who is popular with the Serbian public but has not managed to assert real authority over the security forces or over other parts of the Yugoslav Government.</p>
        <p>"This is a very new situation," said one diplomat. "There's a titanic power struggle going on in Belgrade now, and a great deal depends on how it comes out. There is no sign that Milosevic is going to bow out gracefully, but if Cosic can somehow force him out, then the prospects for peace will improve dramatically."</p>
        <p>Twice in the last five weeks, President Cosic has met in Geneva with the Croatian leader, Mr. Tudjman, in meetings that would have been unthinkable only a few months ago.</p>
        <p>In a declaration issued in Geneva on Tuesday, Mr. Cosic agreed to withdraw Yugoslav troops from the Prevlaka peninsula in southern Croatia, one of their last strongholds on Croatian soil. The two sides also agreed to allow neutral observers to monitor all airports under their control; to establish joint customs posts at border crossings; to form a "joint interstate committee" to discuss reopening of trade and communication links, repatriation of refugees and other pressing issues, and to open "liaison offices" in each other's capitals, which could lead to diplomatic recognition. Militias Aren't Independent</p>
        <p>At the Geneva talks, officials said, Presidents Cosic and Tudjman discussed the outlines of a peace proposal for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where fighting is now centered. Although no troops from either the Croatian or Yugoslav armies are fighting in Bosnia, most of the irregular forces fighting there are under the effective control of one side or the other.</p>
        <p>"The so-called independent Croatian fighters in Bosnia are under direct and daily supervision from Zagreb," asserted one United Nations official. "Serbian fighters are under direct and daily supervision from Belgrade."</p>
        <p>The settlement envisioned by Presidents Cosic and Tudjman would create 8 to 12 districts within Bosnia, with boundaries corresponding roughly to ethnic lines. Each district would have considerable autonomy, controlling its own police and administering local affairs. The central government, based in Sarajevo, would be run by a bicameral legislature, with one chamber elected directly and the other by region.</p>
        <p>Before the fighting began, Bosnian leaders said they were seeking to establish a "unitary state" that would not be determined along ethnic lines. More recently, they have acknowledged that circumstances might force them to accept some form of federal state. U.N. Rejects Bosnia 'Carve-Up'</p>
        <p>United Nations officials insist that they will not accept a "carve-up" of Bosnia, and say that Presidents Cosic and Tudjman have dropped their Bosnian territorial claims. "There is a consensus among those now in power to accept current international boundaries, and to allow a right of return for all refugees," said an official who monitored the Geneva talks.</p>
        <p>But some outsiders close to the Bosnian conflict, as well as many Bosnian leaders fear that even if the two Presidents agree now not to annex parts of Bosnian territory, they may seek to do so in the future.</p>
        <p>"There is a new closeness between Zagreb and Belgrade, but I am afraid it is on the basis of 'To hell with the Muslims,' " one aid worker said.</p>
