        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We were driving, my wife and I, from one end of Connecticut to another on Columbus Day weekend, talking about the coming Presidential debate. Suddenly, I noticed something odd: there were virtually no political bumper stickers on the cars speeding along Interstate 95.</p>
        <p>Through the 1970's and 80's bumper stickers were a distinctive part of American popular culture. Paul Harvey, on his daily radio broadcast, would announce the best of those his listeners had spotted across the United States. But now that phenomenon is palpably in decline.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We were driving, my wife and I, from one end of Connecticut to another on Columbus Day weekend, talking about the coming Presidential debate. Suddenly, I noticed something odd: there were virtually no political bumper stickers on the cars speeding along Interstate 95.</p>
        <p>Through the 1970's and 80's bumper stickers were a distinctive part of American popular culture. Paul Harvey, on his daily radio broadcast, would announce the best of those his listeners had spotted across the United States. But now that phenomenon is palpably in decline.</p>
        <p>Yes, there's still the occasional single-issue bumper sticker in view -- "Boycott Veal," "Support Our Troops," "Guns Don't Kill People, People Do." But the political campaign kind has almost disappeared.</p>
        <p>It's a little over 100 miles from Greenwich to Stonington, the westernmost and easternmost towns on the Connecticut shore. But during four hours of round-trip driving on that highway we could only sight four bumper stickers -- two for Clinton-Gore, one for Ross Perot and one that said, wistfully, Bush-Quayle '88. (There was also, on one car, "I Love Clinton Soccer," but that was in support of a local sports activity.)</p>
        <p>Why so little commitment? Are voters shy or embarrassed about their choices? Is there a new ethic not to parade one's political persuasion in public? Or does the paucity of bumper stickers indicate that many have not made up their minds?</p>
        <p>If the last is true, then the pollsters may be in for another hosing come Nov. 3. ASHBEL GREEN  New York, Oct. 16, 1992</p>
