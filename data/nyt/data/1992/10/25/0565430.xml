        <p>George Michael Steinbrenner 3d learned early on that there are no free lunches, even for the scion of a shipbuilding empire. His father refused to give him an allowance, and presented him instead with a flock of chickens and a few turkeys so he could start his own egg and poultry company.</p>
        <p>Thus it was at the age of 9 he found himself chopping the heads off birds in the exurbs of Cleveland. "That chicken would run around with no head," he said as if visualizing the whole grisly scene. "Suddenly he'd flop down and you had to pick the feathers."</p>
        <p>This was one of the nascent Boss's first business lessons: work hard and chop true. That came in handy when he fired -- he prefers the word removed -- 18 New York Yankees managers in 19 years.</p>
        <p>The second lesson came when his father packed him off for military school at age 15. It might be roughly translated as this: Nice guys finish last. "I sold my egg company to my two sisters for three times what it was worth," he said, with a laugh. "They've never liked me since."</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner, now 62 years old, is back -- thrilled about narrowly escaping bankruptcy at his American Ship Building Company last month and smiling like a Cheshire cat about his impending return to baseball.</p>
        <p>Buoyantly holding forth over a lunch of club sandwiches in a suite at the Regency Hotel where he stays when in New York, Mr. Steinbrenner radiated energy, juggled contradictions and pontificated about everything from the salaries of ballplayers to the trade deficit. He told of traversing a long, dark valley, and finally emerging to glimpse a brighter horizon.</p>
        <p>He comes across as larger than life, or maybe that's just what one expects. Rock-hard handshake. Diamond-studded 1978 World Series ring. Blue eyes sparkling at one of the memories. A hearty laugh perhaps issuing forth just a second too soon.</p>
        <p>Baseball's most outspoken owner -- the only one who has ever hosted "Saturday Night Live" -- is at last returning to his field of screams. Though he doesn't know when, sometime before spring training the Boss will be allowed to take the helm of the Yankees, of which he is 55 percent owner.</p>
        <p>If you're less than charmed by this cheery news, well, pay your $10 and boo the Boss at the park. This activity once seemed as common as hot dogs at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>"The whole stadium wasn't booing me," Mr. Steinbrenner said, recalling in self-defense that even Terrence Cardinal Cook was once booed at a memorial service for the Yankees' captain, Thurman Munson. "Not more than a third to 45 percent booed me."</p>
        <p>Will this be a new Boss, coming out of exile after agreeing to a lifetime ban effective August 1990? He had been disciplined by Fay Vincent, then Commissioner, for paying $40,000 to a self-proclaimed gambler for information aimed at discrediting Dave Winfield, one of Mr. Steinbrenner's star players.</p>
        <p>He suggests that distance from daily controversies may have heightened his previously uncelebrated sensitivity. He mentions a favorite painting by Monet, in which the gobs of paint gain resolution as the viewer steps back. "Perhaps I've had a chance to step back," he said, sipping a glass of skim milk.</p>
        <p>In an ensuing sentence, he would sound emphatically like the Steinbrenner of old.</p>
        <p>"Winning is everything," he said. "I don't care what they tell you."</p>
        <p>In the case of American Ship Building, escaping alive was victory enough. The problem at the company, of which he is the largest owner, was a dispute with the United States Navy involving completion of work on two tankers begun by another shipyard. It was solved when Congress appropriated $58 million to pay for the job.</p>
        <p>Resolving this crisis, he said, was even more satisfying than returning to baseball.  "I lay awake nights," he said. "I have never been through such a tough time, even with baseball."</p>
        <p>"This really allows us to keep going as a viable company," he said. The Tampa, Fla.-based company, which has lost money for six consecutive years, had said it would have to cease operations and seek bankruptcy court protection if the dispute was not speedily resolved. Its customers include United States Government agencies, ocean shipping companies and manufacturing concerns on the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast. One of its units hauls grain on the Great Lakes; it has become the biggest company in that industry, which like the building of civilian ships has shrunken greatly in recent decades.</p>
        <p>The brush with bankruptcy came after repeated cash injections by Mr. Steinbrenner, and personal loan guarantees. He has forcefully denied implications by sports writers that he put Yankee money into the company, though he did invest proceeds of a dividend paid to him and other club owners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner put the issues involved in starkly personal terms. "I detest bankruptcy," he said. "To me it signifies failure -- personal failure, corporate failure."</p>
        <p>The truth is that the American shipbuilding industry has been floundering for years. Ten years ago, there were 110 shipyards in the United States. Today there are 58. Mr. Steinbrenner thinks government help is urgently needed, not least because of the strategic importance of shipping.</p>
        <p>"We can't afford to be a dumping ground for other nations," he said. He said the number of jobs at all levels of government now surpasses those in manufacturing. "Twenty years ago, when we were a strong, mighty nation, that wasn't the case."</p>
        <p>Time and again, Mr. Steinbrenner returned to nationalistic themes, calling himself a "Taft isolationist." He railed against foreign aid, when poverty is growing at home, and urged massive efforts to rebuild the infrastructure and educational system.</p>
        <p>Though convicted of giving President Nixon illegal campaign contributions, Mr. Steinbrenner would not say whether or not he plans to vote for the Republican Presidential ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner repeatedly dived into his memory bank for past experiences that would explain his actions. One was the 1960 bankruptcy of the Cleveland Pipers basketball team, one of his first sports investments.</p>
        <p>He was 30 at the time, and promised to pay creditors back 100 cents on the dollar. "My dad, being the tough guy he was, gave me no help," he said. So instead he bought a Great Lakes tanker and dedicated its profits totally to repaying creditors.</p>
        <p>"I never wanted anybody to say I went down a path with George Steinbrenner and lost money," he said. A reward came 30 years later when one of the repaid investors approached him and thanked him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner gave every impression of this being a period of transition. Though he returned as chairman of the ship company after the untimely death on Aug. 3 of the previous chairman, Adm. Paul Butcher, two other Navy veterans will now take the helm.</p>
        <p>His two sons, Hank and Hal, and two sons-in-law, Joseph Molloy and Steven Swindal, are taking up more and more reins of the family empire. It consists of the Yankees, the shipbuilding company (which is expected to report revenues of $100 million in the year ended Sept. 30) and a half-dozen hotels. Mr. Steinbrenner also has thoroughbred horses in Kentucky and in Florida. He lives in Tampa with his wife of 36 years, Joan.</p>
        <p>"I'm very blessed at having four good men to step forward," he said.</p>
        <p>What was not clear was what he envisions his own role will be after returning to the Yankees. His banishment from baseball has meant he can not even visit his offices in Yankee Stadium. He says he doesn't yet know when that will end. He said he never accepted the March 1 date set by Mr. Vincent, calling that a "unilateral decision."</p>
        <p>He said he has not spoken to Bud Selig, the man in charge of the major leagues since Mr. Vincent resigned. "I haven't wanted to bother him," Mr. Steinbrenner said. "He's my friend, and I respect what pressures he's under."</p>
        <p>For the Yankees owner, sooner is clearly better. He talks of learning about Yankee player trades in the newspaper, and how he and his son-in-law Joe Molloy have so scrupulously avoided talking baseball that they "sit at the Christmas table like two mummies."</p>
        <p>He summed up the new situation thusly: "At least I will have something to say about how they spend my money."</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner denied he had instigated a conversation to sell the team to Paramount Communications Inc., but said a meeting was held with Paramount in March to discuss such a sale. "That was aborted," he said.</p>
        <p>He said that some of the noisy fusses that characterized his reign were devices to take pressure off players or generate publicity. "Some of that was to get the back page," he said, referring to where tabloids play major sports articles. "Some of it was for real."</p>
        <p>There might be a new style now, though veteran Yankee watchers will have to see it to believe it -- and some will never believe anything that comes out of George Steinbrenner's mouth. "Different strokes for different folks," Mr. Steinbrenner said. "Different rhymes for different times."</p>
        <p>He exuded good feeling, saying Reggie Jackson, with whom he often sparred, is the most deserving candidate for baseball's Hall of Fame. Of Dave Winfield's success on the Toronto Blue Jays, he said, "I'm genuinely happy for David."</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinbrenner occasionally displayed a self-deprecating side, telling how touched he was that so many American athletes asked to be photographed with him at the Olympics. "I guess they'd never been around a man who was thrown out of baseball," he said.</p>
        <p>His eclectic interests include playing the piano, reading novels, watching wrestling and driving harness horses. He calls harness racing the perfect antidote for the staid world of business, where "you're not around anybody but lawyers and accountants, and you get a boardroom mentality," he said. "You don't do enough dangerous things."</p>
        <p>Sitting on a little cart behind a thundering thoroughbred seems just the prescription. "Your stomach is right in your throat, and I don't care who you are," he said. "It's the scariest feeling I've ever had."</p>
