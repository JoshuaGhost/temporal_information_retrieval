        <p>H. Gardner Ingraham, a lawyer whose career in New York City spanned nearly four decades, died on Tuesday at his home in Northport, L.I. He was 80 years old.</p>

He interrupted his Federal career to serve as a lieutenant in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II.</p>
        <p>In 1947 Mr. Ingraham was a co-founder of the Manhattan law firm of McLanahan, Merritt &amp; Ingraham, which became Windels, Merritt &amp; Ingraham in 1974. Mr. Ingraham retired from practice in 1975 and then opened a private practice in Northport until 1986.</p>
