        <p>Wouldn't "The Holy Terror," the Simon Gray drama at the Promenade Theater, be better off as a one-man play?</p>
        <p>Granted, it would have to be one terribly agitated man, given to hallucinations and apt to forget, in a flash of fury, where he is and whom he's talking to. But if the jangled soul were haunted enough by the events of his life, you really wouldn't need the other characters who turn up in Mr. Gray's latest work to reach our shores.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't "The Holy Terror," the Simon Gray drama at the Promenade Theater, be better off as a one-man play?</p>
        <p>Granted, it would have to be one terribly agitated man, given to hallucinations and apt to forget, in a flash of fury, where he is and whom he's talking to. But if the jangled soul were haunted enough by the events of his life, you really wouldn't need the other characters who turn up in Mr. Gray's latest work to reach our shores.</p>
        <p>Such an evening just might be more compelling than the bilious muddle that the English playwright has concocted and, doing himself no favors whatsoever, directed soporifically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray has long shown a fondness for articulate rotters at odds with society, their mates and their jobs. Mark Melon, the central figure of "The Holy Terror," is another in the dishonorable line of sour literary figures who populate such earlier works as "Butley," "Otherwise Engaged" and "The Common Pursuit." Melon (Daniel Gerroll) has had considerable success bringing a venerable but faltering London publishing house into the 1980's, even if it has meant stacking the lists with sex guides and soft-porn novels. He possesses a confidence of iron, a teen-ager's libido and enough cunning charm to bend others to his driven will.</p>
        <p>Or he did once.</p>
        <p>When we first meet Melon, he is on the far side of a massive breakdown that has left him dazed and hesitant. The kind ladies of the Cheltenham Women's Institute have invited him to address their assembly -- as part of their ongoing series, "Why Me?" -- although they seem to be looking forward primarily to the tea and sandwiches that follow the talk.</p>
        <p>Appearing from behind a drab curtain and tiptoeing to the center of the stage, Melon resembles more an apologetic mole venturing into the bright light of day than the free-wheeling publisher of yore. Lest he go blank, he's even got a stack of 3-by-5 cards carefully tucked away in the pocket of his gray suit to remind himself of the points he wants to make.</p>
        <p>No sooner has he begun his lecture, however, than his mind wanders and people out of his troubled past stride on stage, distracting him from the afternoon's civilities. We see him seducing his eager young secretary (Lily Knight), bullying various co-workers, mocking his clients and excoriating his son (Noel Derecki), who has committed the grievous error of eating cornflakes in the evening.</p>
        <p>Melon's wife (Kristin Griffith) pads on -- wearing only a bra and panties under her powder-blue wraparound coat -- and he grills her about her lover, although it's not altogether certain she has one. The titillating talk may be a game between them, a way of getting the "itch" going. If so, the game appears to be veering out of control. Just as quickly as these phantoms materialize, they disappear -- leaving Melon barking like a mad dog or standing there stupidly, his trousers about his ankles, or fumbling for another 3-by-5 card.</p>
        <p>I suppose the interruptions can be described as flashbacks, but they're too fragmented to qualify as scenes, and too unrealistic to represent what really might have happened during the dark, paranoid days of Melon's breakdown. What we're seeing is the inside of his mind, and now and then it may occur to you that he is coming unglued all over again.</p>
        <p>"The Holy Terror" made its first appearance in London in 1987 as "Melon." Unhappy with the play, which had the poor man ricocheting from his apartment to the workplace to the psychiatrist's office, Mr. Gray rewrote it completely. In the earlier work, the poisonous suspicion that his wife might be unfaithful fueled the publisher's crackup. (Mr. Gray came to believe that premise too pat, "Othello" notwithstanding.) Now, the publisher seems to be accusing his wife of infidelity</p>
        <p>because</p>
        <p>he's cracking up. The old motive has become just another symptom of the dark flux overtaking him for no detectable reason.</p>
        <p>As he explains to the patient ladies in the audience, he has trouble attaching hard meanings to his experiences. His psychiatrists certainly have no answers -- only glib patter that makes them, when they put in their brief appearance on stage, seem like end men in a minstrel line. Melon is adrift in a sea of existential befuddlement -- the holy terror, I presume. If there's a God, He's the Supreme Ironist, mainly out to give Himself a chuckle or two.</p>
        <p>The supporting characters don't fare well in any of this. They're not so much people as splintered memories of people, bit players in someone else's narrative. They behave according to the whims of Melon's mind, which at best perceives them as threats, bothers or enigmas. Summoned by free association, dismissed at will, they have no dramatic weight of their own. Consider it revelatory that four of Melon's colleagues are played by the same actor (Anthony Fusco) and, except for a twitch here, an accent there, they are virtually interchangeable.</p>
        <p>That's why I suspect Mr. Gray could do away with them entirely. There's little benefit to be gained from seeing them in the flesh. "The Holy Terror" would probably be more gripping, in fact, if we</p>
        <p>didn't</p>
        <p>see them, only sensed from the troubled glaze in Melon's eyes or the sudden shiver down his spine that the demons were back to plague him.</p>
        <p>This would put a huge load on the actor playing Melon, agreed, and I'm not sure Mr. Gerroll is the person to shoulder it. He's not inconsequential in the role, but he's not exactly a heavyweight, either. With his shock of sandy hair, trim physique and smartly tailored suit, he comes across as one of those slick Madison Avenue types who make a career out of shallow ingratiation. A certain petulance clings to his torment, trivializing it. He's more spoiled sport than madman.</p>
        <p>Still, the next time around, the right actor could go on an impressive rampage in "The Holy Terror." (This production is scheduled to close tonight.) What Mr. Gray has to do first is clear the decks of any hangers-on. The people Melon needs to confront are already lodged in his head. Nobody else is required to show up. All through "The Holy Terror," he's wrestling with himself.</p>
        <p>So why not let him?</p>
        <p>'You Could Be Home Now'</p>
        <p>In the course of "You Could Be Home Now" (in Martinson Hall at the Joseph Papp Public Theater), Ann Magnuson does a quick sendup of Emily Webb, the gushing heroine of "Our Town," who learns too late how wonderful life really is. Ms. Magnuson, a favorite of the downtown performance art scene, isn't about to be caught in such a shameless display of sentiment. There have been too many late nights for that, too many artificial stimulants, too many playmates from the 1980's dying before their time. Nonetheless, she's trying to do precisely what Thornton Wilder's heroine wanted to do -- go home again.</p>
        <p>And, like Emily, she's failing.</p>
        <p>Failure is the pre-ordained conclusion here, as countless playwrights and novelists have already suggested. More interesting, is the place she's trying to get back to -- the environs of Charleston, W. Va., where the backwoods accents are still thick and the poisonous clouds from the chemical factories are even thicker. Subdivisions have carved up the landscape, the mayor's been convicted of cocaine use ("We're all looking forward to his 11,000 hours of community service," Ms. Magnuson chirps), while the interstate appears to have carted away the family home. Somehow, the satellite dish is well on its way to becoming "the new state flower."</p>
        <p>Apparently, Ms. Magnuson really did return to the region to participate in a ritual she calls the "Famous Persons Day Celebration," although she takes a wry view of her fame and, in the songs and dances that are part of the evening, tends to reduce show business to its cheesier dimensions. I don't want to make this sound too rational, though. "You Could Be Home Now" is chiefly an exercise in ironic surrealism, which allows Ms. Magnuson, the sole performer, to impersonate some of the area's benighted citizens, parody stupid television programs, wreak havoc on "The Cherry Orchard," pay a terpsichorean tribute to Tom Brokaw, and generally wonder where the good times went. The 1990's sit wearily upon her frail shoulders. "At this point, I'd rather see 'Brigadoon' than just about anything with Michael Douglas in it," she sighs.</p>
        <p>Under the right lights, the performer looks like a young Shirley MacLaine. (Under other lights, she looks like a prettier Lypsinka.) As a singer-dancer, however, she hasn't advanced much beyond the ballet, tap and baton lessons that she received during her West Virginia childhood. Her skills as an actress are better developed, and she has that startling ability to plunge instantly into a characterization. One minute, she's a redneck cocktail waitress, lamenting her job at the Thirsty Pilgrim in the basement of the Daniel Boone Hotel. The next, she's no less convincing as a dowager, forced by the crumbling economy to auction off the family possessions on the Home Liquidation Club, a cable TV attraction. (In between, she's likely to explore half a dozen not necessarily related issues.)</p>
        <p>Assuming audience reaction the other night is indicative, her fans find her uproarious. Frankly, I didn't. Too often, she settles for easy pokes at sitting ducks. I did find her unexpectedly touching, however. A deep sense of loss runs through this crazy, chaotic show. In her heart, Ms. Magnuson knows the party is over and that she really ought to be heading home, if only she could figure out where home is these days.</p>
        <p>When she wasn't looking, someone seems to have uprooted all the signposts.</p>
