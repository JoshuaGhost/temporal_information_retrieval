        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Why Ban Other Troupes From the Delacorte?" by Marjorie Heins (letter, Oct. 9) implies that New York City Parks and Recreation is flouting a State Supreme Court ruling that compels us to allow groups other than the New York Shakespeare Festival to use Central Park's Delacorte Theater. The decision simply requires us to set out the contract terms of our agreement with the festival.</p>
        <p>Full-scale dramatic productions require such activity before and after production as rehearsal and design, installation, breakdown and removal of sets. On the days the Grass Roots Troupe performed in Central Park and Bryant Park, the Shakespeare Festival was completing the performance season and postproduction activities. Thus, our inability to provide the Delacorte was not based on favoritism or other bias.</p>
