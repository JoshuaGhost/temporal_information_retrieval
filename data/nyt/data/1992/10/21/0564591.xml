        <p>Dressed in an expensive white blouse and a black skirt, a Government official stood on a street here handing out out money and documents to a crowd of disheveled earthquake victims.</p>
        <p>"I have helped them," the official, Awatif Sayed, said a bit defensively, pointing to a woman whose daughter was killed in the earthquake eight days ago. "I gave her 500 pounds and I will give her the rest of the money soon."</p>
        <p>But after living for more than a week on the dirt sidewalk in front of their damaged dwelling, the weary men, women and children were having none of it.</p>
        <p>"We don't want your money!" shouted Mohammed Ali Abdel Hamid. "We want a place to live!"  City Called a Powder Keg</p>
        <p>The Government's halting response to the earthquake on Oct. 12 has turned this packed city of 14 million into what one columnist, Mohammed Tantawi of the weekly Akhbar al-Youm, called "a powder keg," setting off riots and fanning support for Muslim fundamentalists just two weeks before municipal elections. Sporadic rioting by the homeless on Saturday night was put down only after the Government saturated the districts affected with heavily armed police officers.</p>
        <p>"The earthquake has exposed the Government's failure to deal adequately with Egypt's severe housing problem," said Milad Hanna, a former opposition member of Parliament, "and this will have grave political consequences in the weeks ahead."</p>
        <p>The governing National Democratic Party, in power since 1977, had already been struggling to contain a wave of Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt's slums and rural backwaters.</p>
        <p>To the chagrin of Government officials, fundamentalists quickly filled the void in disaster relief, opening shelters and providing medical aid in some areas within hours of the disaster. The earthquake killed 552 people, injured nearly 10,000 and left 3,000 families homeless.</p>
        <p>"The earthquake was a godsend for the fundamentalists in different ways," said Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a leading political commentator. "They have portrayed the event as God's vengeance on a corrupt society.  But more important, they have used it to show that they can provide services while the Government is ineffective."</p>
        <p>After pleading unsuccessfully with local bureaucrats to cut through red tape and build emergency shelters, the Government has mobilized the army to set up three tent cities south and northwest of Cairo. Officials have also provided emergency housing to some 2,000 families in a new city that is being built outside Cairo, but it will take weeks to install water, electricity and sewage systems.</p>
        <p>President Hosni Mubarak promised on Sunday that people who were left homeless would be given new housing, but said the process could take four to six weeks. The Government has also pledged to give 5,000 pounds, about $1,500, to each family that lost a member in the earthquake.</p>
        <p>The earthquake, which destroyed an estimated 5,004 homes nationwide, caused shoddily built tenements to come tumbling down in this densely populated city. Many other buildings are now riddled with cracks or lean dangerously.</p>
        <p>One of the worst affected areas was the overcrowded slum of Bulaq, which according to Government engineers had many decrepit structures that should have been condemned before the earthquake struck. Crude cardboard shelters with sheets or cloth draped over their tops now hug a wall on one back street.</p>
        <p>"The fundamentalists built these," said Fawziya Mohammed Hassan, a 23-year-old mother of three who is staying in one of the shacks. "They come by twice a day to give us beans and meat sandwiches."</p>
        <p>The unofficial relief operations have angered Government officials, who accuse the banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Group, an underground Muslim organization, of turning the chaos to their own advantage.</p>
        <p>"The Government has enough to handle the crisis," said Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa. "If anyone wants to do anything they should do it through the Government. What is this becoming, a state within a state?"</p>
        <p>The discord and chaos seem to be a result not only of the earthquake but also of decades of Government corruption and neglect. Egyptian bureaucrats regularly demand bribes to carry out the simplest of tasks, and nepotism and favoritism are common in the distribution of benefits. Earthquake victims accuse Government officials of passing them off from one office to the next.</p>
        <p>During the riots in Bulaq, hundreds of residents stoned shops and streetlights. Many chanted denunciations of President Mubarak by name, something that is rarely done by Egyptian laborers and peasants.</p>
        <p>Stunned by the animosity of the crowds, the Government attributed the protests to agitation by fundamentalists, but many in the slums dispute that charge.</p>
        <p>"They say it was the fundamentalists who marched, but this is a lie," said Mr. Hamid, a 33-year-old driver with four children.</p>
        <p>"All of us here marched," he said with a sweeping gesture down the street where families sat forlornly on straw mats. "We did not go into the streets because of the fundamentalists. We went because we have no place to live, and the Government is doing nothing to help us."</p>
        <p>The crisis may not dissipate with the rows of bright orange tents that are being set up by the army on the city's outskirts. Cairo has an acute housing crisis, with as many as a dozen people often squeezing into a narrow room that lacks running water in its worst tenements.</p>
        <p>"There is housing for those with money," said Mr. Hanna, the former lawmaker, "but there is nowhere for the poor to go."</p>
