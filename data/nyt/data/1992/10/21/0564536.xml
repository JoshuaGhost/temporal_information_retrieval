        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Democrats are proposing a Band-Aid approach on family leave, while the Republicans oppose even a Band-Aid.</p>
        <p>Psychiatric findings published about 45 years ago informed us that bonding of an infant with an affectionate mother is generally essential to establish healthy psychological growth in later years of childhood. Two years of bonding are ideal, but at least one year is tolerable.</p>
        <p>Leading industrial nations in Europe subsidize paid (not unpaid) maternal leave, and they also provide heavily subsidized day care for infants and older children with carefully selected and trained personnel, who give children affection and the rudiments of social relationships.</p>
        <p>The legislation prepared by the Democrats and vetoed by President Bush calls for short-term, unpaid maternal leave. Many working mothers could not afford to lose their wages during even this short term, and the time is far too short for bonding. President Bush will not approve any universal mandate for even unpaid leave and proposes only measures that evade reality.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' proposal of a $1,000 tax break for day care expenses is another Band-Aid. It is impossible to buy a year's day care for a toddler with quality personnel for $1,000 in rural areas. The cost runs far higher for an infant, and in urban areas, the costs are still higher.</p>
        <p>The divorce rate of more than 50 percent in our country and the malaise and psychological disorders we have among our schoolchildren do far more harm to our economy than what it would cost to prevent them with paid maternal leave and quality day care. FREDERICK S. LIGHTFOOT  Greenport, L.I., Oct. 1, 1992</p>
