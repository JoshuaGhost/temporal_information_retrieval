        <p>The chief executive of Connecticut's only casino, opened earlier this year by an Indian tribe, has resigned, citing philosophical differences with the tribe's leadership.</p>
        <p>No specifics were available from a spokesman for the tribe, the Mashantucket Pequots, or the executive, Alfred J. Luciani.</p>
        <p>His departure comes on the heels of an unusual proposal he made last week to state lawmakers, who are considering proposals for casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford. If the state would block such projects, Mr. Luciani told a legislative hearing, the tribe might be willing to share some of its profits with the state, which at present receives no income from the operations of the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo &amp; Casino in Ledyard under the terms of a compact with the tribe. New Opportunities Cited</p>
        <p>A tribal spokesman, Bruce Macdonald, denied any link betwen Mr. Luciani's remarks and his resignation. "It's strictly a coincidence," he said today. "I know the timing suggests otherwise." Mr. Luciani has agreed to stay on until a successor can be named, Mr. Macdonald said, adding, "He wants to go on to new management opportunities."</p>
        <p>Mr. Luciani was hired by the 250-member tribe last year to oversee development of the casino on tribal property in eastern Connecticut.</p>
        <p>A former New Jersey prosecutor, he left law enforcement for the gambling industry and worked for the Golden Nugget and other casinos in Atlantic City. At Foxwoods, he installed a management team largely from Atlantic City, as well.</p>
        <p>In an interview in December, Mr. Luciani remarked on the differences between his management philosophy and that of the Mashantucket Pequots. "I think in terms of quarterly profits and annual results," he said, "and they really think in terms of the millennium."</p>
        <p>The casino has been very successful since it opened in February, attracting an average of 10,000 people a day to its 24-hour operation, which features poker, craps, blackjack and other games in a "natural" setting of bubbling brook-like fountains and a tree-filled atrium.</p>
        <p>The casino, which won the right to open only after a long legal battle that was decided by the United States Supreme Court, projects gross revenue of at least $100 million by its first anniversary. Construction has already begun on a $142 million expansion, including a hotel, parking garage, additional gaming parlors, a theater and a shopping concourse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luciani, who announced his resignation on Saturday, could not be reached for comment today. An assistant in his office said he would be out of town for several days.</p>
        <p>His proposal to the state, however, presents an intriguing problem for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who opposes casinos. It would enable the governor to block the development of additional casinos, while obtaining much-needed revenue for the state.  His spokeswoman, Avice Meehan, said he would have no comment on the proposal, adding, "He has much more ambitious goals for the people of this state, in terms of long-term economic development." Separate-Nation Status</p>
        <p>William DiBella, a State Senator from Hartford who supports building new casinos in Connecticut, said he thought Mr. Luciani's proposal would be difficult to apply because of the tribe's separate-nation status. '</p>
        <p>'They cannot be taxed under that status," Mr. DiBella said.</p>
        <p>He also said that he considered casinos not only sources of revenue for cities like Hartford, but also "an economic development tool and catalyst."</p>
        <p>The tribe has agreed to reimburse the state for the cost of regulatory services like conducting security checks on casino employees. In the current fiscal year, the state expects to receive $2.58 million in such payments, Ms. Meehan said.</p>
