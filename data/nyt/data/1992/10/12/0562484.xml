        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Stop Swindling New York" (Op-Ed, Sept. 14), Joseph Rose of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council charges that New York State's Wicks Law inflates the cost of municipal construction for the benefit of politically influential specialty contractors and demonstrates the contemptuous unresponsiveness of New York legislators to the public interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose goes astray by assuming that the public is interested in the timely and economical construction of courthouses, hospitals, police stations, firehouses, shelters for the homeless, jails and water pollution control plants, all of which the Wicks Law renders more expensive and long-in-coming. However, we New Yorkers do not care strongly about any of those things, as the remarkable longevity of Wicks shows.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Stop Swindling New York" (Op-Ed, Sept. 14), Joseph Rose of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council charges that New York State's Wicks Law inflates the cost of municipal construction for the benefit of politically influential specialty contractors and demonstrates the contemptuous unresponsiveness of New York legislators to the public interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose goes astray by assuming that the public is interested in the timely and economical construction of courthouses, hospitals, police stations, firehouses, shelters for the homeless, jails and water pollution control plants, all of which the Wicks Law renders more expensive and long-in-coming. However, we New Yorkers do not care strongly about any of those things, as the remarkable longevity of Wicks shows.</p>
        <p>For 30 years, reports have documented this law's evils. Calls for its repeal have echoed down the decades from bar associations, civic leaders, judges, good-government groups and editorial boards -- all to no avail.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature itself recognizes that construction within budget and without delay cannot be achieved under Wicks. That is why when something had to be built that was really important -- like a new football stadium for the Buffalo Bills -- our representatives enacted a limited exemption from Wicks.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers should ask but never do: How come we build so little at so much cost? JOHN F. GRUBIN  Chairman, New York City Procurement Policy Board New York, Sept. 22, 1992</p>
