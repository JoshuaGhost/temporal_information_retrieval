        <p>The group formed to buy the San Francisco Giants, led by GEORGE SHINN, announced yesterday that it would not make a formal offer for the team.</p>
        <p>SPENCER STOLPEN, president of the the National Basketball Association Charlotte Hornets and Shinn Enterprises Inc., said the group broke up because "in final analysis it did not make business sense to go forward with the purchase."</p>
        <p>"We didn't decide to part ways," Stolpen said. "We decided collectively not to go forward and make a bid."</p>
        <p>Shinn, who owns the Hornets, had been named managing general partner in the group, which sought to buy the Giants to prevent them from moving to Florida, where investors have made a formal bid for the team.</p>
        <p>It was unclear if any remaining local investors would proceed with plans to present an offer to the National League president, BILL WHITE. The group had planned to meet with White today.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for a local developer, WALTER SHORENSTEIN, another member of the investor's group, said early yesterday that the investors remained prepared to meet with White but would not make a formal offer for the team.</p>
        <p>"George is out, but we're continuing on our own," said a Shorenstein spokesman, RICHARD CHICOTEL.</p>
        <p>Stolpen said the decision not to make an offer was based on several considerations, including the team's financial status and the lack of a firm proposal to build a new ball park for the team. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
