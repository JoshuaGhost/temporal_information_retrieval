        <p>One way to score a Presidential debate is to ask: What did each candidate need to achieve and did he do it? Measured by that standard, the first of the three Presidential debates was less than a triumph for President Bush and a fair night for his two opponents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, still trying to revive his candidacy for re-election with just over three weeks to go, needed a surprise, some reason for voters to change their minds about a President who has become well defined for most Americans over the last four years. He did not achieve it.</p>

        <p>One way to score a Presidential debate is to ask: What did each candidate need to achieve and did he do it? Measured by that standard, the first of the three Presidential debates was less than a triumph for President Bush and a fair night for his two opponents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, still trying to revive his candidacy for re-election with just over three weeks to go, needed a surprise, some reason for voters to change their minds about a President who has become well defined for most Americans over the last four years. He did not achieve it.</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Clinton needed to avoid a major gaffe that would slow his campaign, and he did that. He also may have made progress toward another goal -- making Americans more comfortable with the idea of his sitting in the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>But Ross Perot definitely got what he wanted -- time on the same stage with the major parties' candidates and an opportunity to offer his peculiar brand of homespun prescriptions for what ails America while the other two attacked each other and fell into a replay of the campaign: Mr. Bush's status-quo message against Mr. Clinton's calls for change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot re-established himself as a candidate following his on-again-off-again bid for the White House and showed he can be comfortable in the rough-and-tumble world of Presidential campaigning. But he went beyond that: while Mr. Clinton played it safe and Mr. Bush seemed flat by comparison to the other two, Mr. Perot looked like a man who was having a really good time. Evading Attacks</p>
        <p>He grinned over his lectern and made the most of his free air time, emerging the clear winner in the warm-and-fuzzy sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot also showed himself to be the kind of candidate he might have been had he stayed in the race, with his jokes and his direct, authoritative, if fact-free, answers to questions that produced vague responses from his opponents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot probably made the biggest splash of the night, and it is conceivable now that he can use this new burst of exposure to hurt one of the other two candidates, depending on the state.</p>
        <p>But he clearly benefited last night from the way the two major party candidates saved most of their fire for each other. And he has yet to face any real attack from the other two candidates on the obvious questions on which he is vulnerable, including whether his decision to drop out when he was doing badly and then re-enter the race when the dynamics changed made him a quitter.</p>
        <p>For now, one of the most evident results of the first debate was that Mr. Bush's insistence on including Mr. Perot in the three Presidential debates may have backfired.</p>
        <p>Instead of upstaging Mr. Clinton, as the Republicans had hoped, Mr. Perot joined the Democratic nominee in a two-against-one attack on the President. For the vast bulk of the 90 minutes of the debate, Mr. Bush looked as though he was on the defensive -- when viewers got a look at him at all.</p>
        <p>The most obvious result of Mr. Perot's addition to the debate was to cut into the on-screen time that Mr. Bush needed so badly. He was was not even visible to voters two-thirds of the time, while the nation looked at and listened to the other two candidates. And they were using their time to chip away at Mr. Bush's record and credibility.</p>
        <p>The addition of Mr. Perot to the political mix enabled Mr. Clinton to etch a strong contrast between his own policies and of those of Mr. Bush, to portray himself as the major alternative for voters seeking a change in the White House.</p>
        <p>It took only a few minutes for the debate to settle into the now-familiar pattern of the campaign: Mr. Bush insisted that the economy was not as bad as people think, relied heavily on getting credit for the end of the cold war and campaigned against Democratic candidates of the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, tried to present himself as a man more in touch with the concerns of average Americans, ready to make difficult decisions but clear-eyed about the challenges. And Mr. Perot devoted most of his time to painting himself as "the people's choice," a hard-charging businessman taking on a greater challenge because Americans want him to. 2-on-1 Criticism</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot's presence was evident from the very first question, as Mr. Bush pulled out what his campaign considers his most powerful weapon: experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot acidly conceded that Mr. Bush had a point. "I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt," he said.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Perot virtually sprang to Mr. Clinton's defense and turned the heat back on Mr. Bush as the President attacked the Arkansas Governor on another favorite Republican campaign issue: Mr. Clinton's antiwar activities during the Vietnam years.</p>
        <p>"Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there," he said. "But I think it's very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person in your formative years? Or did they occur when you were a senior official in the Federal Government?"</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, the debate was the latest in a series of attempts at redefinition. He has failed so far to shed the image of a detached President who was powerful on issues of diplomacy and war that no longer seem so pressing, and who is flaccid on more urgent domestic issues.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Bush offered nothing essentially new, sticking to his insistence that the economy is doing better than most Americans recognize. The White House has conceded that this very position hurt Mr. Bush badly in 1991 as he refused to recognize publicly the sluggishness of the economy, but it has nevertheless remained at the heart of Mr. Bush's campaign.</p>
        <p>Over and over, Mr. Bush offered the same answers: "We've got it," when asked what he would do to insure a strong military, or "We did it," when Mr. Perot talked about cutting back on long-range nuclear weapons. The President also fogged his answers with esoteric, alphabet-soup bureaucratese.</p>
        <p>He repeatedly mentioned the end of the cold war. "We've dramatically changed the world," he said, several times offering this standard passage from his campaign speeches: "Kids go to bed at night without fear of nuclear war."</p>
        <p>Looking for ways to persuade Americans that he was committed now to domestic problems after focusing on foreign affairs for much of his first term, Mr. Bush even promised to keep James A. Baker 3d on at the White House after the election, even though he said just a few days ago that he would like Mr. Baker to resume his job as Secretary of State.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's challenge was the polar opposite of Mr. Bush's. He must still convince voters that they not only want a change, but that they are comfortable with him -- as a person and as a President.</p>
        <p>After months of running an extraordinarily energetic campaign that gave him a lead in the public-opinion polls, Mr. Clinton spent the weeks before the debate engaged in an effort to sit on his lead and leave the fighting to the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Clinton's performance was more steady than spectacular. Buthe stayed focused on dispelling concerns about his draft record, about his lack of experience in foreign policy and domestic policy at the national level and even about his family. At one point, Mr. Clinton used part of his time to wish his wife, Hillary, a happy 17th wedding anniversary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's desire to avoid any missteps was perhaps most evident in his answer to a question about whether he would make members of the Federal Reserve Board "more accountable." Any real answer -- yes or no -- would have affected the markets and given the Bush campaign a free field of fire. So Mr. Clinton did the only thing he could. He evaded the question.</p>
        <p>"Frankly I don't think that's the problem today," Mr. Clinton said, turning to an attack on Mr. Bush's economic policies.</p>
