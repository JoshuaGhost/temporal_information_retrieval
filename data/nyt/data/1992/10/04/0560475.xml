        <p>RUNNING Conquering the Corporate Challenge</p>
        <p>Mike Quinn of London won the Corporate Challenge five-kilometer run down Park Avenue yesterday in a time of 16 minutes 15 seconds. Mike Connor of Chicago was second in 16:31, followed by Peter Tootel of England in 16:37. In the women's division, Kim Kauls of Charlotte, N.C., was the winner in 20:06. Allison Fletcher of London was next in 20:08, and Nicolle Mounty of London was third in 20:31. A field of 1,354 runners from 15 American cities and London competed.

        <p>Maurizio Damilano set a world record of 2 hours 1:44 minutes in the 30-kilometer walk yesterday at Cuneo, Italy, in what he said was his farewell to competition. Damilano, who announced his retirement before the record attempt, cut 2:12 minutes off the mark set by Thierry Toutain of France in March 1991. The 35-year-old Italian was fourth in the Barcelona Olympics. (AP) AUTO RACING  Fittipaldi Gets a Little Help</p>
        <p>Two disputed calls by Indy-car officials helped Emerson Fittipaldi run away with the Marlboro Challenge all-star race yesterday at Pennsylvania International Speedway in Nazareth, Pa. Both Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti were assessed critical stop-and-go penalties for passing the pace car during the only caution period of the 100-lap event. Neither agreed with the call. Fittipaldi's Penske-Chevrolet drove off to leads of up to 19.26-seconds over Andretti before he eased up and won by a comfortable 10.59 seconds at an average speed of 156.127 miles an hour. Andetti finished second. Rahal was sixth. (AP) GOLF Hallberg Soaks Up a 1-Stroke Lead</p>
        <p>Gary Hallberg sloshed his way to his second straight 69 yesterday and a one-stroke lead over Jim Gallagher after three rounds of the $700,000 Southern Open in Pine Mountain, Ga. A steady rain pelted the Mountain View Golf Course at Callaway Gardens through the day, but it did not prevent Hallberg and 27 other golfers from shooting under-par rounds. Gallagher shot a 70. (AP) Just Another 'Sunday' Outing: Sunday came a day early in the Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C., the richest event on the Senior PGA Tour. "With last week so fresh in their minds and with the forecast, everybody played like it was Sunday," Jim Colbert said yesterday. "Everybody came out smoking."</p>
        <p>Colbert shot a five-under-par 67 that left him with a two-shot lead after 36 holes of the $1.35 million event. The final round is scheduled for today, but whether it will be played is very much in doubt. The weather forecast called for heavy overnight rains and a 70-percent chance of more rain today. In the event the weather becomes too severe, or the course becomes unplayable, the tournament will be reduced to 36 holes -- just as it was last week in Atlanta -- and Colbert will be the winner for the second consecutive year. (AP) HARNESS RACING Easter Sun Hanna Ties World Mark</p>
        <p>Easter Sun Hanna equaled the world record for 2-year-old pacing colts on a half-mile track, clocking 1:541/5 at Freehold Raceway yesterday in the $15,000 first division of the Lou Babic Memorial Pace. The world record is now held by Easter Sun Hanna, Tooter Scooter and WRH. (AP)</p>
