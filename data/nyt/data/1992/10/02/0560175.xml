        <p>Brasserie des Theatres</p>
        <p>The Broadway theater district finally has an authentic French brasserie that serves from breakfast through late supper. Called Brasserie des Theatres, in the Paramount Hotel, it is the creation of Max Bernard, Jean-Michel Diot and Philippe Lajaunie, the partners who own Park Bistro and Les Halles, both in Manhattan. The space has a distinctly Parisian feel, right down to the ocher walls, chocolate-colored banquettes, gold-framed mirrors, squat marble columns and service staff in long white aprons.</p>

        <p>Brasserie des Theatres</p>
        <p>The Broadway theater district finally has an authentic French brasserie that serves from breakfast through late supper. Called Brasserie des Theatres, in the Paramount Hotel, it is the creation of Max Bernard, Jean-Michel Diot and Philippe Lajaunie, the partners who own Park Bistro and Les Halles, both in Manhattan. The space has a distinctly Parisian feel, right down to the ocher walls, chocolate-colored banquettes, gold-framed mirrors, squat marble columns and service staff in long white aprons.</p>
        <p>Just as genuine is the food. One can start lunch or dinner with a deliciously wine-flavored cold beef Bourguignon in a light aspic ($7.25), an excellent fish soup with croutons and aioli ($7.25), or something as simple as stone crab claws with basil mayonnaise ($7.50). A full range of oysters and clams is available, too. Main courses sampled included a perfectly cooked fresh cod in a nicoise-style sauce of olives and tomatoes with sliced potatoes ($19), good roast chicken with garlic cloves and mashed potatoes ($18), and a terrific lightly smoked salmon ($20) cooked in what the French call petit sale style (prepared with salt pork) along with delicious lentils.</p>
        <p>With a well-chosen regional French wine list and cooking like this, the restaurant promises to be among the brightest lights on Broadway this season. Brasserie des Theatres, 243 West 46th Street, serves breakfast from 7 to 10:30 A.M., lunch from noon to 3 P.M. (food is served at the bar until dinner) and dinner from 5:30 P.M. to 1 A.M. daily. All major credit cards are accepted. Telephone: (212) 719-5588. No Reopening After Fire</p>
        <p>David K's and Java, on Third Avenue at 65th Street on the Upper East Side, which were destroyed by a fire on Sept. 24, will not reopen, said the owner, David Keh. Mr. Keh said rebuilding would be too expensive. He said he planned to open two new restaurants at 209 East 49th Street: Shanghai 1933, featuring Shanghai cuisine (in late November), and Noodle Road, a Chinese noodle house (Oct. 11).</p>
