        <p>Even before the trial of John Gotti began, the rulings of Judge I. Leo Glasser have had a significant impact on the case. He disqualified Mr. Gotti's longtime lawyer, Bruce Cutler, last July, because the lawyer participated in taped conversations that were part of the prosecution's evidence.</p>
        <p>During the trial, Judge Glasser exercised tight control over the lawyers, holding one of them, Anthony M. Cardinale, in contempt of court for arguing vociferously about the judge's decision to exclude a defense witness.</p>

        <p>Even before the trial of John Gotti began, the rulings of Judge I. Leo Glasser have had a significant impact on the case. He disqualified Mr. Gotti's longtime lawyer, Bruce Cutler, last July, because the lawyer participated in taped conversations that were part of the prosecution's evidence.</p>
        <p>During the trial, Judge Glasser exercised tight control over the lawyers, holding one of them, Anthony M. Cardinale, in contempt of court for arguing vociferously about the judge's decision to exclude a defense witness.</p>
        <p>And the judge ruled out five of the six witnesses whom the defense wanted to present for a variety of legal reasons, leaving them only a tax lawyer who said he advised Mr. Gotti that he did not have to file income-tax returns while under indictment.</p>
        <p>Judge Glasser has shown a special concern for the security and privacy of the jury throughout the trial. Under his orders, the jurors have been identified only by numbers, and they have been housed in an undisclosed hotel under the supervision of Federal marshals.</p>
        <p>The 67-year-old judge is a former dean of Brooklyn Law School who was appointed to Federal District Court in Brooklyn 10 years ago. A graduate of City College and Brooklyn Law School, he served on the Family Court bench for several years before becoming dean of the law school in 1977. On Monday, he will observe his 68th birthday.</p>
