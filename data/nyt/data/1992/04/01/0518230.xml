        <p>Abaxis Inc., a medical devices company trying to develop a portable blood analyzer to give doctors data in minutes instead of days, said yesterday that its president and chief executive, Richard K. Leute, had resigned and been replaced by the company's chairman, Gary H. Stroy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leute, who helped to found the company, resigned last Friday as an officer and director because of "personal reasons," Mr. Stroy said. Mr. Leute, 54 years old, remains a consultant to the company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. Mr. Stroy, 49, remains chairman.</p>
        <p>Kenneth E. Rubenstein, 51, previously a consultant in product development to Abaxis and other companies, was also named Abaxis's vice president of development.</p>
        <p>Abaxis was founded in 1989 by Mr. Stroy, Mr. Leute, and Vladimir E. Ostoich, who remains Abaxis's senior vice president of research and development. The name Abaxis is Latin for "away from the axis," referring to the centrifugal force used in many devices to separate elements in blood.</p>
        <p>The company, which has 50 employees but no revenue as yet, has spent about $10 million developing a device that would allow physicians to analyze the blood of patients immediately. Currently, hospitals can only analyze blood economically by batching together a large number of blood samples from patients and have them tested by a huge device the size of an automobile. The process can take hours or even days.</p>
        <p>"Let's say a doctor in the morning wants to discharge a patient, but needs a blood workup," said Mr. Stroy in an interview. "He may have to wait for the results in the evening or even the next morning. That's $1,000 for an extra day's hospital stay."</p>
        <p>Abaxis expects to introduce a commercial device later this year, Mr. Stroy said. He said he did not expect any sharp change in policies because of the management shifts. He said he had participated in the running of Abaxis from its beginning.</p>
