        <p>Little Me  The York Theater Company 2 East 90th Street Manhattan Through April 26 Book by Neil Simon; music by Cy Coleman; lyrics by Carolyn Leigh; based on the novel by Patrick Dennis; directed by Jeffrey B. Moss; sets by James E. Morgan; costumes, Michael Bottari and Ronald Case; lighting, Stuart Duke; technical director, John Miller; production stage manager, Alan Fox; musical director, Leo P. Carusone; choreographer, Barbara Siman. Presented by the York Theater Company, Janet Hayes Walker, producing director; Molly Pickering Grose, managing director, in association with One World Arts Foundation. WITH: Jo Ann Cunningham, Stephen Joseph, Denise Le Donne, Amelia Prentice, Jonathan Beck Reed, Russ Thacker and Ray Wills.</p>
        <p>When a musical has dialogue as funny as Neil Simon's laugh-a-minute book for the 1962 show "Little Me" and songs as catchy as the Cy Coleman-Carolyn Leigh score for that musical, some fun is virtually guaranteed, no matter how unfocused the production. And in the York Theater's miniaturized revival, Mr. Simon's raucous jokes and such good-natured Coleman-Leigh tunes as "I've Got Your Number" and "Real Live Girl" put over a production that is as spirited as it is raw and every which way.</p>

        <p>Little Me  The York Theater Company 2 East 90th Street Manhattan Through April 26 Book by Neil Simon; music by Cy Coleman; lyrics by Carolyn Leigh; based on the novel by Patrick Dennis; directed by Jeffrey B. Moss; sets by James E. Morgan; costumes, Michael Bottari and Ronald Case; lighting, Stuart Duke; technical director, John Miller; production stage manager, Alan Fox; musical director, Leo P.

Presented by the York Theater Company, Janet Hayes Walker, producing director; Molly Pickering Grose, managing director, in association with One World Arts Foundation. WITH: Jo Ann Cunningham, Stephen Joseph, Denise Le Donne, Amelia Prentice, Jonathan Beck Reed, Russ Thacker and Ray Wills.</p>
        <p>When a musical has dialogue as funny as Neil Simon's laugh-a-minute book for the 1962 show "Little Me" and songs as catchy as the Cy Coleman-Carolyn Leigh score for that musical, some fun is virtually guaranteed, no matter how unfocused the production. And in the York Theater's miniaturized revival, Mr. Simon's raucous jokes and such good-natured Coleman-Leigh tunes as "I've Got Your Number" and "Real Live Girl" put over a production that is as spirited as it is raw and every which way.</p>
        <p>Based on Patrick Dennis's spoof of a self-serving Hollywood memoir, and set around the time of World War I, "Little Me" chronicles the rise of Belle Poitrine (nee Schlumpfert) from Drifter's Row in Twin Jugs, Ill., to movie stardom, riches and social glory. As she ascends, assorted lovers and husbands meet with sudden, untimely demises. The story is narrated by the mature Belle (Jo Ann Cunningham), with the events in her life re-enacted by her younger self (Amelia Prentice).</p>
        <p>"Little Me" was originally a vehicle for Sid Caesar, who played all of the significant men in Belle's life, from a bogus French music-hall performer to a colossally dumb prince. In the 1982 Broadway revival, those roles were divided between James Coco and Victor Garber. In the York Theater production, most are played by Jonathan Beck Reed.</p>
        <p>In this drastically pared-down "Little Me," five actors -- Mr. Reed, Stephen Joseph, Denise Le Donne, Russ Thacker and Ray Wills -- play more than 50 parts. Mr. Wills's portrayals of a number of minor characters have the most comic subtlety, while Mr. Joseph's crude drag depictions of two female characters are more typical of the production's anything-goes attitude. The frantic donning and shucking of roles helps to give the production, which is directed by Jeffrey B. Moss, the feel of a slapstick revue, a lighthearted satire turned into a goofy musical cartoon in which loose-jointed vaudeville routines substitute for polished production numbers. The singing doesn't even try to be showstopping.</p>
