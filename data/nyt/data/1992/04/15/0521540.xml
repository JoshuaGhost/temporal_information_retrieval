        <p>Dick Schofield, acquired for protection, is going to be the everyday shortstop for the Mets. Kevin Elster, with a trip to the doctor in the offing and further shoulder surgery a possibility, could be finished for the season.</p>
        <p>Elster is scheduled to fly to Birmingham, Ala., tomorrow for another evaluation of the right shoulder that was operated on in September 1990. The Mets concede surgery could be the ultimate diagnosis. "He's concerned," Manager Jeff Torborg said. "We talked with him last night. He doesn't know why it hasn't got better."</p>
        <p>The Mets said yesterday that Elster had told them he was experiencing pain in the shoulder. "Do I feel deceived?" General Manager Al Harazin asked. "To an extent. We'd made the determination that, pain or not, he wasn't right and that we had to act. It's why we got Schofield."</p>
        <p>They are expected to make a more definitive move today, putting Elster on the disabled list and promoting outfielder Rodney McCray from Tidewater.</p>
        <p>Before Schofield started his last night against the Phillies, Torborg pronounced the 29-year-old infielder the full-time shortstop. "I'd call myself an everyday player," said Schofield, who was a backup with the Angels. "But I can't make any promises beyond that."  BASEBALL</p>
