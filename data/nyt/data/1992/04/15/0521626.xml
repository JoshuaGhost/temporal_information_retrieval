        <p>Why is it that around every April 15, some celebrity is in the toils of the law for tax evasion? Leona Helmsley, the erstwhile queen of the hotel world, was indicted in mid-April 1988. Convicted and unable to reduce her four-year sentence, she goes to prison on this tax deadline day.</p>
        <p>The reason is that the revenue authorities, prosecutors and even Federal courts often join to make an example of noteworthy violators as an incentive to voluntary taxpayer compliance. Is this unjust, either for tax violators in general or Mrs. Helmsley in particular?</p>

        <p>Why is it that around every April 15, some celebrity is in the toils of the law for tax evasion? Leona Helmsley, the erstwhile queen of the hotel world, was indicted in mid-April 1988. Convicted and unable to reduce her four-year sentence, she goes to prison on this tax deadline day.</p>
        <p>The reason is that the revenue authorities, prosecutors and even Federal courts often join to make an example of noteworthy violators as an incentive to voluntary taxpayer compliance. Is this unjust, either for tax violators in general or Mrs. Helmsley in particular?</p>
        <p>Clearly the appetite for a public flogging can lead to cruelty and unfairness, especially when it invites punishment that doesn't fit the crime. Yet in this case there's little room for complaint. The sentence is reasonable and its timing is certainly appropriate, given the available enforcement resources in a nation that depends so heavily on voluntary compliance.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of scheming with her husband, Harry, to underpay $1.2 million in taxes by disguising $2.6 million in personal expenses as business expenses related to their real estate empire. A witness at her trial testified that Mrs. Helmsley once boasted that "only the little people pay taxes." That testimony, which she disputed, probably explains why Mrs. Helmsley made so many enemies and why the I.R.S. finds her a suitable example.</p>
        <p>Her sentence, lengthy by some tax standards and heavy for a woman 71 years old, is not excessive on the evidence. Her lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, calls it unjust because of the frailty of her husband, who was found incompetent to stand trial. Given his client's age, Mr. Dershowitz also calls the sentence a form of capital punishment. Both arguments could add a chapter to one of Mr. Dershowitz's best-selling books -- not "Reversal of Fortune" but the one titled "Chutzpah."</p>
        <p>A taste of prison is often especially appropriate for those who engage in white-collar crime. They seem to dread prison more than cruder criminals do, yet they experience it less. It is sad to see the fallen queen in such straits. Yet her conspicuous self-pity cannot obscure her culpability.</p>
