        <p>With shameful penury, the Bush Administration balks at humanitarian intervention in Somalia because it might cost the United States $7.5 million. This would have been the U.S. share of an innovative proposal to send a battalion of 500 United Nations soldiers to protect relief workers trying to feed starving Somalis.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the burden of monitoring a shaky truce falls on a far smaller blue-helmeted presence: 50 military observers, costing $1 million, of which the American share will be $303,800. That's all the Security Council, bowing to U.S. pressure, saw fit to authorize last week.</p>

        <p>With shameful penury, the Bush Administration balks at humanitarian intervention in Somalia because it might cost the United States $7.5 million. This would have been the U.S. share of an innovative proposal to send a battalion of 500 United Nations soldiers to protect relief workers trying to feed starving Somalis.</p>
        <p>As it stands, the burden of monitoring a shaky truce falls on a far smaller blue-helmeted presence: 50 military observers, costing $1 million, of which the American share will be $303,800. That's all the Security Council, bowing to U.S. pressure, saw fit to authorize last week.</p>
        <p>Granted, the chaotic strife between rival sub-clans in Somalia has left the country without a government. Granted, too, that Arab neighbors like Saudi Arabia have escaped paying anything like a fair share of special peacekeeping assessments. But those aren't the real reasons the Bush Administration has refused to pay the pittance needed.</p>
        <p>State Department officials advised the U.N. that Congress and voters were weary of paying for peacekeeping operations. Their overall global cost may exceed $3 billion this year because of operations in Yugoslavia and Cambodia. Congress has already slashed $70 million from a $350 million request -- even though Washington is already the leading defaulter on peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>What's amazing is not resistance in Congress, but the silent acquiescence of George Bush. The Administration is in the peculiar position of agreeing to thousands of peacekeepers in chaotic Yugoslavia while balking at a battalion in Somalia. What does Mr. Bush say to African protests that race accounts for the difference?</p>
        <p>The President has failed to say anything at all about peacekeeping, leaving his minions to justify American chiseling. And adding ignominy to injury, the Administration blames the voters and a Democratic Congress for its own shrunken vision.</p>
