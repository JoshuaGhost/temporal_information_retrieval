        <p>"Shakespeare on the page is O.K.," Mr. Gibson said after receiving the award. "But the magic begins when people take those words from the page and put wings on them."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson received the award for his part in renewing interest in Shakespeare, both in his recent film portrayal of Hamlet and in a video he made called "Mel Gibson Goes Back to School."</p>
        <p>In it, he enacts some scenes from Hamlet and discusses the play with Los Angeles high school students. On Saturday morning he did the same thing, in person, with 15 Washington-area high school students, listening to them read their favorite passages from Hamlet. Then he read his own favorite, the "too too solid flesh" passage.</p>
