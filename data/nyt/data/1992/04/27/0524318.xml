        <p>The prevailing struggle throughout the former Soviet Union, in this post-Communist transition, is over property and power: who rules, how far and over what?</p>
        <p>Here in the former Leningrad, where a similar struggle in 1917 was resolved in favor of the Bolsheviks, today's battle swirls around Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak. Mr. Sobchak, an articulate lawyer once considered a possible successor to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, now seems politically marooned amid the many islands and canals of what once again is called St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>"Sobchak long ago outgrew the mayoralty," said Aleksei L. Kudrin, a 31-year-old economist who works for the Mayor. "Perhaps he should have become more of a national figure, but the Soviet Union unraveled so quickly, and now it's too late -- there is already a new sort of politician," he suggested: A younger person, less tied to Mr. Gorbachev and the old Government. Exile or Refuge?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobchak is 55 years old, and remains both active and ambitious. While St. Petersburg can seem a golden exile from new power centers in Moscow, it may also be a place to stay out of the line of fire if President Boris N. Yeltsin's programs go badly wrong.</p>
        <p>Carefully, Mr. Sobchak has laid down a position that more consciously tries to straddle the old politics and the new. While he is broadly supportive of Mr. Yeltsin's aims, he has been highly critical of the strategy and details of the reforms, whether economic, political or constitutional.</p>
        <p>He has said, for instance, that Mr. Yeltsin should have privatized state enterprises first, to try to demonopolize the market, before freeing prices. He has accused Mr. Yeltsin of nominating the wrong people for his government, in particular such theoretical economists as Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar. And he has said that Mr. Yeltsin has succeeded only in making Russians poorer. A Softer Alternative</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobchak has also called for a softer economic reform incorporating more price controls and a transitional period, in which large state enterprises can continue to operate more or less as they have traditionally done, to avoid sweeping unemployment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobchak has seemed so at ease with the old power structure and so sharp about Mr. Yeltsin that some of Mr. Sobchak's earliest supporters on the City Council now accuse him of betraying the democratic ideal itself.</p>
        <p>After watching Mr. Sobchak in the Soviet Parliament in 1989, "we considered him a supporter of democracy ," said Vitaly V. Skoibeda, 31, a City Council member and one of the Mayor's harshest critics. Mr. Sobchak was drafted by democrats like Mr. Skoibeda to run for the council and become its chairman in 1990, and then was elected Mayor in June 1991.</p>
        <p>"But our first impression of Sobchak and the reality did not correspond," Mr. Skoibeda said. "In fact, it's different by 180 degrees. He wants to govern without answering to anyone."</p>
        <p>But Sobchak watchers, who include the city's diplomats, say the former law professor sees himself as "the ultimate realist" and regards his critics as naive idealists who confuse theory with politics, and whose idea of democracy is a balance of power so fine as to produce inefficient proto-chaos.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Vladimir V. Putin confirms this view of Mr. Sobchak. "Having tried to work with these innocent new people," Mr. Putin said, Mr. Sobchak realized "he needed expertise," especially in the period of economic transition, so he turned to some of those "who know what button to push to get things done."</p>
        <p>These include people like Mr. Putin himself, but most particularly and visibly Georgi Khizha, the former director of Svetlana, one of St. Petersburg's largest military-industrial enterprises. It is Mr. Khizha who, by sheer competence, is now Mr. Sobchak's chief deputy, managing the city while the Mayor thinks, speaks and travels abroad to attend conferences or search for Western investment and aid. Mayor's Office in Smolny</p>
        <p>A good example of symbolic conflict is Mr. Sobchak's decision to move the mayoralty offices into Smolny, the school for young women which was Lenin's headquarters and from which the Communist Party long ran Leningrad. Mr. Sobchak has said that Smolny had better offices and telephones; his critics say that Mr. Sobchak likes the grandeur, and that thetelephone lines run to the old power structure, which hasn't really changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sobchak has also infuriated the council by concentrating powers in the mayoralty that they believe belong to them or to the courts. As in the recent battle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, the real fight is over the rights, powers and accountability of leaders and legislatures.</p>
        <p>The difference here is that the city council firmly backs Mr. Yeltsin, while its members regard Mr. Sobchak as an effective ally of forces like the large industrial enterprises and collective farms that are opposing Mr. Yeltsin on a national level.</p>
        <p>But the battles actually being fought concern property, which once belonged to the city or the state, and who controls what happens to it. To entice Western investment, Mr. Sobchak has promised some of the city's best buildings, though badly run down, to companies like Credit Lyonnais. The council thinks it should decide what buildings are transferred and at what terms, and has a list of 11 older buildings and more than 90 new ones that it feels Mr. Sobchak has transferred illegally. Control of City Courts</p>
        <p>The council has objected to his plans for a lavish renovation project, called New Holland, on one of the city's islands, and his attempt to concentrate control over the city's courts inside the Mayor's office.</p>
        <p>Despite the opinion of the city's prosecutor that Mr. Sobchak has not violated the law, the City Council voted on March 30 to send a list of what they call Mr. Sobchak's illegalities to Mr. Yeltsin and Russia's Constitutional Court, asking them to remove him from office. The vote, 148 to 72 with 19 abstentions, had no legal basis, but was interpreted as a vote of no confidence.</p>
        <p>More than two weeks later, the list has not been sent, though Chairman Aleksandr N. Belyayev of the City Council said it would be finished "soon." But he agreed that whatever the Constitutional Court said, Mr. Yeltsin will not dismiss Mr. Sobchak.</p>
        <p>"It's a way to put pressure on Sobchak," Mr. Belyayev said. "It's a kind of guerrilla tactics." He said he disagreed with the vote, but understood it. "The Mayor is not paying sufficient attention to the problems of the city. He should be more of a manager of city affairs than a national politician. "</p>
        <p>Western business people and diplomats generally agree. One businessmen said: "Sobchak is a hopeless manager. He makes promises and nothing gets done. Running the city seems to bore him." Another said: "Nobody even takes notes in his meetings. He talks beautifully and has wonderful intentions, but no follow-through."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kudrin, the city economist, says Mr. Sobchak is aware of such criticism, which is one reason why he has turned to men like Mr. Putin and Mr. Khizha. But he acknowledged that such men may only delay the fundamental change to a market economy.</p>
