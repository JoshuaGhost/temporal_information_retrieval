        <p>Grace Knowlton  M-13 Gallery 72 Greene Street SoHo Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>Grace Knowlton's big faux boulders make an elegant show, an ensemble that at first seems too naturalistic, like a rock garden taken inside, and then becomes increasingly deliberate and artistic. Ms. Knowlton has worked with the spheres, as she calls them, since the early 1970's, making them first in clay, then in Fiberglas, concrete and steel. In those years her pieces often seemed like simplistic enlargements of forms already made much more evocative by the artist Eva Hesse in the late 1960's.</p>

        <p>Grace Knowlton  M-13 Gallery 72 Greene Street SoHo Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>Grace Knowlton's big faux boulders make an elegant show, an ensemble that at first seems too naturalistic, like a rock garden taken inside, and then becomes increasingly deliberate and artistic. Ms. Knowlton has worked with the spheres, as she calls them, since the early 1970's, making them first in clay, then in Fiberglas, concrete and steel. In those years her pieces often seemed like simplistic enlargements of forms already made much more evocative by the artist Eva Hesse in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>But in 1990 Ms. Knowlton started working with sheets of welded copper. As this show demonstrates, her use of this material, which she distinctively pieces together and patinates, has brought a new complexity to her essentially Minimalist art.</p>
        <p>The patinas, unevenly dripped and snared in shades of gray, green or white, suggest both abstract painting and natural weathering. The spheres, whose piecemeal, crinkled surfaces are full of gaps, overlaps and suture-like wells, are gently Cubist in effect. One is so deliberately fractured it seems to have been turned inside out, and indeed the tensile, buoyant shapes make one unusually aware of their unseen interior volumes.</p>
        <p>This exhibition forms a gratifying denouement to a long and focused career.</p>
