        <p>After weeks of fashion-world guessing games, Harper's Bazaar will hire PAUL CAVACO as its fashion director. One or more additional fashion directors, who supervise the selection and photography of clothes for the magazine, may be hired later, said Sean Sullivan, a spokesman for Hearst Magazines, which owns Harper's Bazaar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavaco, a principal in Keeble Cavaco &amp; Duka, a New York public-relations firm, is a widely respected stylist who has worked closely with photographers like Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Bruce Weber and Steven Meisel. With Mr. Weber, he conceived the original Brooke Shields advertisements for Calvin Klein jeans, and recently, Mr. Cavaco worked with Mr. Meisel and Madonna on an erotic book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavaco, who is 40 years old, has resigned as a partner in Keeble Cavaco &amp; Duka, effective June 1, the date he will assume his position at Harper's Bazaar. Keeble Cavaco &amp; Duka will continue under the same name with three remaining partners.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 25, 1992, Saturday</p>
        <p>A report in the Chronicle column yesterday about the appointment of Paul Cavaco as fashion director of Harper's Bazaar misidentified the photographer who shot the original Brooke Shields advertising campaign for Calvin Klein jeans. He was Richard Avedon, not Bruce Weber.</p>
