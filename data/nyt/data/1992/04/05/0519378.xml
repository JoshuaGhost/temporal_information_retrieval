        <p>THERE is something rewarding about having a vine growing in the garden. When put in the right place, a vine can do wonders to screen out something unsightly or provide a dramatic upright statement. The best part, most vines grow easily without much tending.</p>
        <p>Annual vines are the easiest to start with. They last for one year and are then killed off by fall frosts. These vines can be temporary solutions. If the look is not right for the place in the garden, then the experiment lasted for only a year, and another planting scheme can be tried.</p>
        <p>One of the best annual vines is the old-fashioned morning glory. When given the right location and allowed to grow at its own pace, nothing can be more dramatic. As its name suggests, it is an unusual flowering vine in that the flowers do close up in mid-afternoon. But the vine is in full bloom in the morning hours.</p>
        <p>The most widespread cultivar is the gloriously named Heavenly Blue, which is indeed a beautiful blue that is a little darker at the edges fading to near white in the centers. Sometimes gardeners can find packets in seed racks of either the red-flower sort, named Scarlett O'Hara, or the other near-white variety, called Pearly Gates.</p>
        <p>The vine looks excellent on a fence, where it can be used to screen, or on a sunny bank, where it can tumble. One tip: the seed is hard and sometimes difficult to germinate; soaking the seed overnight helps, or it may be started indoors in peat pots, now or toward the end of the month. Then as soon as the weather settles, in mid to late May, the young plants can be set out.</p>
        <p>A similar-looking vine is the moon flower, which has huge white flowers. The vine blooms at dusk, and if it is planted in the right place, its flowers can be easily seen. The flowers are up to five inches across. Although it, too, has hard seeds, the moonflower is easier to grow. It is a vine that is ideal for apartment patios, where the blooms can add much to the early evening hours.</p>
        <p>And lucky are those who can successfully grow the climbing sweet peas. Once the old-fashioned vine was a must for every garden. These beautifully fragrant flowers are a huge success in Britain, where the plants adapt well to the cooler climate.</p>
        <p>If the seed is sown early (as with all peas), the flowering vines provide lovely bouquets of flowers with brilliant colors in shades from white to soft pink to deeper blues and a dark purple.</p>
        <p>If a vine proves to be the right choice for the garden, then some serious thought might be given to perennial vines. Once planted, they will come up year after year. Of course, the queen of all perennial climbing vines is clematis, which deserves a full dissertation.</p>
        <p>Yet many other vines deserve thought and space. Consider the unusual-looking actinidia, especially the species Actinidia kolomikta. This spectacular vine, which is native to Asia, is a vigorous grower. It usually evokes some sort of comment, for it has variegated foliage: green, pink and white on the same leaf. The male form of this dioecious vine has the white or pink-tip leaves.</p>
        <p>Actinidia needs a little help to get a good start. Once established in a good sunny location, it will thrive and cover a trellis or arbor in no time. Judicious pruning will keep it under control.</p>
        <p>Those who like to attract hummingbirds to the garden often include the well-known trumpet vine. The long-throated orange-red flowers are a joy to see and a delight when hummingbirds hover near the flowers.</p>
        <p>One caution with this vine: never overfeed it, as it does quite well in rather ordinary soil. Overfed vines grow too vigorously and produce abundant leaves but few flowers.</p>
        <p>Another vine that is often planted is the akebia, which provides dramatic screening with long-lasting leaves that are palmate and quite showy. The overall texture is fine, but one drawback is that the vine tends to pop up where it is least expected, since it forms underground runners.</p>
        <p>Perennial vines must be watched over, lest they grow too vigorously. Three vines not recommended for home planting are bittersweet, honeysuckle and, in many cases, wisteria. All of these vines have reputations for growing vigorously, which can cause trouble.</p>
        <p>Annual vines, simple to grow and easy to care for, are the ones for novices to consider.  GARDENING</p>
