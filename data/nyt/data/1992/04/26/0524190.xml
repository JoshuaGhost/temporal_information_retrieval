        <p>Celtics 119, Pacers 112</p>
        <p>BOSTON, April 25 (AP) -- John Bagley matched his career high of 35 points and got 3 of his 15 assists on Boston's last three overtime baskets as the Celtics took a 2-0 playoff lead with a 119-112 victory today over the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>The Celtics won their 10th game in a row and 17th of 18 while pushing their winning streak at Boston to 19 games.</p>
        <p>They can clinch the three-of-five-game Eastern Conference quarterfinal series by winning on Monday or Thursday night at Indiana.</p>
        <p>Bagley, who scored Boston's last 8 points of the third quarter to cut an 86-78 deficit to 88-86, heated up again after the Pacers opened a 108-104 lead with 2 minutes 50 seconds left in overtime.</p>
        <p>Indiana's only overtime field goal was Micheal Williams's 3-pointer with 4:24 to go.</p>
        <p>Bagley sank an 11-footer with 2:32 remaining. Williams then missed a 3-pointer, and Bagley connected from the right corner, tying the score, 108-108, with 1:53 remaining.</p>
        <p>After an offensive foul against Indiana's Detlef Schrempf, Bagley fed Kevin Gamble for the go-ahead jumper from the top of the key with 1:24 to go. Williams missed another 3-pointer with 57 seconds to play and Kevin McHale rebounded.</p>
        <p>This time, Bagley missed a layup, but got the offensive rebound and passed to Robert Parish for a layup that put the Celtics on top, 112-108, with 37 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Indiana's Reggie Miller then sank two free throws, but Bagley made two with 31 seconds left. After Williams missed again, Bagley lobbed the ball to Gamble for a breakaway dunk that made the score 116-110 with 21 seconds remaining. Trail Blazers 101, Lakers 79</p>
        <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Kevin Duckworth, the Portland center, had 19 points and 9 rebounds as the Trail Blazers defeated Los Angeles to take a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series.</p>
        <p>The Blazers can sweep the three-of-five-game series with a victory on the Lakers' court Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>A 15-1 run over the final four and a half minutes of the third quarter put Portland on top, 78-55. The Blazers led by as many as 27 as they cruised home.</p>
        <p>The Lakers' only point during the run came on a free throw by Byron Scott after Portland's Cliff Robinson drew his second technical foul, for shoving A. C. Green, and was ejected.</p>
        <p>Clyde Drexler had 15 points and 10 rebounds but was only 7 for 20 from the field. Terry Porter also scored 15 for the Blazers.</p>
        <p>The Lakers, who fell behind by 36 points in the first half before losing, 115-102, Thursday night, stayed within striking distance until the decisive surge.</p>
        <p>The Lakers wanted to slow the tempo and succeeded, but it didn't make any difference as Los Angeles shot a 39 percent from the field. Warriors 115, SuperSonics 101</p>
        <p>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tim Hardaway scored 23 points and Mario Elie ignited Golden State with 17 second-half points to even the three-of-five-game series at one game apiece. Game 3 is scheduled Tuesday in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Eddie Johnson scored 22 points and Shawn Kemp had 17 points and 19 rebounds for the Sonics, who were outrebounded, 48-41, by the smaller Warriors. The SuperSonics outrebounded Golden State, 54-32, in their 117-109 victory in Game 1.</p>
        <p>Chris Mullin scored 20 points and Sarunas Marciulionis 18 for Golden State, which trailed most of the first half before outscoring Seattle, 30-18, in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>A full-scale brawl nearly broke out early in the third period after Alton Lister committed a flagrant foul against Kemp, who retaliated by wrestling Lister to the floor under the Golden State basket. Four other players -- two from each team -- joined the altercation, and all were sent sprawling as Lister and Kemp fell.</p>
