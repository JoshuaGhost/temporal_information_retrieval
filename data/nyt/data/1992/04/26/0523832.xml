        <p>The 19th-century Gare du Nord in Paris is being renovated. One section of the refurbished terminal will be only for long-distance trains, including new high-speed T.G.V.'s serving northern France. Another section will be reserved for traffic to Britain and the Channel Tunnel, and will operate much like an airport with a duty-free area, according to a French Rail official. The Channel Tunnel is scheduled to open in the fall of 1993; work on the Gare du Nord is expected to be completed by July 1993 in time for the first northern T.G.V.'s. A row of offices on the mezzanine is being removed to allow natural light to filter through the glass-covered roof, and a parking lot for 1,300 cars is being built underground.</p>
