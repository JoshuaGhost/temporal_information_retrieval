        <p>Only three states have more delegates to the Democratic National Convention than Pennsylvania's 169.</p>
        <p>But it is difficult to tell that from the desultory activity that has passed for campaigning in the weeks leading up to the state's Presidential primary on Tuesday. From Independence Hall in Philadelphia to the Golden Triangle in Pittsburgh, from the Poconos to Lake Erie, many Pennsylvanians are unaware of the primary and many others have trouble suppressing yawns.</p>
        <p>"People are underwhelmed," a county chairman said. "Me too."</p>
        <p>Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, still struggling to free himself of questions about his integrity, has a wide lead in the polls, and he is expected to win going away. But there is no sound of trumpets, no rumbling of a bandwagon to be heard. A month ago, in New York, 56 percent of the voters surveyed on Election Day said they wished someone else were running; in the latest Pennsylvania poll published in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week, the number reached 65 percent. 'No Intensity' by Clinton</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California has spent more time in the state than Mr. Clinton, whose arrival here was delayed for almost a week by strained vocal cords. But Mr. Brown's exertions have won him little support, even in depressed areas, like the Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh, where his attacks on big business and indifferent government might have been appealing.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania Poll, which surveyed 445 Democrats from April 15 to 18, with a margin of sampling error of five percentage points, showed Mr. Clinton with 43 percent among the most likely voters, as against 20 percent for Mr. Brown, 20 percent for former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, whose name remains on the ballot even though he withdrew from the campaign several weeks ago, and 17 percent undecided.</p>
        <p>That is not a powerful showing for the Arkansas Governor at a time when he has been conceded the nomination by most politicians and analysts.</p>
        <p>"Pennsylvania is a conservative state where economic issues count the most," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville State College. "There's nothing trendy, flamboyant or avant-garde about Democrats here. They don't care much about so-called character issues. But Clinton has been a no-show. His campaign events have been well staged, but there haven't been many, and there's no intensity."</p>
        <p>In sharp contrast to the New York primary, Mr. Brown has for the most part refrained from attacking Mr. Clinton, although this week, walking in Aliquippa, where the closing of steel mills has devastated the local economy, he said, "Voting for Clinton is like taking out a ticket on the Titanic." He has done little advertising on television as his contributions have faded.</p>
        <p>A third-place finish in New York, behind Mr. Clinton and the ghost candidacy of Mr. Tsongas, has made Mr. Brown a less appealing alternative to many voters and helped create the possibility that the same fate could befall him here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has all but ignored Mr. Brown, attempting to refocus his campaign on President Bush and the fall.  His primary strategists, Paul E. Begala and James Carville, speak about using the primary to introduce him to a state that the Democrats must win in November if they are to have a chance nationally.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, Pennsylvania has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Its population is shrinking as places like Altoona, where the railroads were once king, and Johnstown, once a steel center, search for new identities. But despite that, and despite a big Democratic registration edge, Pennsylvania has gone Republican in each of the last three Presidential elections. Seeking Reagan Democrats</p>
        <p>For Mr. Clinton, bringing Republican-voting Democrats back home -- regaining the so-called Reagan Democrats -- is the key to general-election victory here as well as in other industrial states. Pennsylvania, Mr. Begala said last week, has "11.5 million of the type of people we are trying to address in this campaign."</p>
        <p>To help him do it, Mr. Clinton has traveled around with Senator Harris Wofford, carrying him along like an amulet. With the help of Mr. Carville and Mr. Begala, Mr. Wofford lured the swing voters in his upset victory over former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last year. His big issue was health care, and he was at Mr. Clinton's side Friday at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, describing Mr. Clinton as "the kind of man who I believe can turn the right of affordable health care into reality."</p>
        <p>A large number of the Reagan Democrats are union members, and Mr. Clinton picked up two valuable endorsements on Friday from the 900,000-member United Automobile Workers and the 200,000-member United Mine Workers. Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, said this week that the union was "entirely comfortable with Clinton's ability to force the Bush campaign to expose its weaknesses on the issues."</p>
        <p>But the presumptive nominee's efforts to turn the primary here into a preview of a Bush-Clinton contest in the fall have been hampered by two men, Ross Perot and Pennsylvania's unconventional Governor, Robert P. Casey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton descended from the "Presidential" plane on which he has tried to pitch his campaign to attack Mr. Perot, the potential independent candidate, asserting that Mr. Perot's lobbying activities and contributions to politicians made him every bit as much a politician as other candidates.</p>
        <p>Concentration on Mr. Perot by the press for the last week has made it harder for Mr. Clinton to draw attention to his own substantive speeches, on which he is relying to make him seem a big enough man for the White House.</p>
        <p>The bigger threat has been Mr. Casey, a conservative Democrat now in his second term, who is extremely popular in this state. In a series of interviews in the last week, he has bluntly stated his conviction that Mr. Clinton has been so seriously damaged by questions of probity that he cannot defeat Mr. Bush this fall.</p>
        <p>"This is the worst possible nightmare for our party," Mr. Casey said in an interview on Thursday. "Nobody's going to vote in the primary -- tiny turnout. Clinton has barely emerged from a very weak field. In terms of staying power for the fall, there are red flags everywhere, and they'll stay there unless he can convince people that he's trustworthy.</p>
        <p>"In one poll, 85 percent of the Democrats in the state say they think the country's on the wrong track, which ought to be Bush's death sentence. Yet Bush is ahead of Clinton here, because people don't trust Clinton. Nobody's cheering, nobody's happy. As things stand now, they're not going to vote for a President Clinton in this state, I can assure you of that."</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Casey's views will change large numbers of votes is dubious; he himself says Mr. Clinton will win "by plenty" and argues that "Jerry Brown has lost his fast ball." But his pointed remarks only remind people of the doubts that Mr. Clinton had hoped to banish here next week.</p>
