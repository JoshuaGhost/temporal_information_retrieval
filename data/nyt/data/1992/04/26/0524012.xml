        <p>HAVING MORE THAN ONE, WITH NO side effects, is now easier than ever. There are at least three dozen nonalcoholic beers and wines on the market, and some are extremely good. They allow people who want to limit their alcohol intake to have a glass of something more interesting than mineral water at a dinner party or to segue from regular beer or wine to a healthier drink.</p>
        <p>The demand for nonalcoholic beverages began about a decade ago and has been growing here and abroad ever since. They are consumed mostly by people who sometimes drink alcohol but who, for various reasons, prefer not to have it on particular occasions, according to beer makers. Limiting alcohol helps control calories: 12 ounces of regular beer have 120 to 150 calories, whereas nonalcoholic beer contains just 60 to 75 calories. In addition, certain people are advised not to drink alcohol, including pregnant women; diabetics; older people, whose tolerance for alcohol tends to decrease, and many patients on chemotherapy or taking antidepressants, antibiotics or muscle relaxers.</p>

        <p>The demand for nonalcoholic beverages began about a decade ago and has been growing here and abroad ever since. They are consumed mostly by people who sometimes drink alcohol but who, for various reasons, prefer not to have it on particular occasions, according to beer makers. Limiting alcohol helps control calories: 12 ounces of regular beer have 120 to 150 calories, whereas nonalcoholic beer contains just 60 to 75 calories. In addition, certain people are advised not to drink alcohol, including pregnant women; diabetics; older people, whose tolerance for alcohol tends to decrease, and many patients on chemotherapy or taking antidepressants, antibiotics or muscle relaxers.</p>
        <p>Public awareness of the hazards of drinking and driving, coupled with designated-driver programs and random alcohol testing on highways, also influences the choice of a nonalcoholic beverage. Some recreational boaters are choosing beer without alcohol, because drinking is as incompatible with safety on the water as it is with safety on the road. Recent statistics show that alcohol is responsible for most boating fatalities. "People are telling us they are interested in getting away from drinking so much alcohol," says Gary Purece, marketing director of Ariel Vineyards in Napa, Calif., which makes 13 nonalcoholic wines.</p>
        <p>Nonalcoholic drinks are not new. There is evidence that they existed as far back as ancient Egypt. Nonalcoholic brews were supposedly reserved for the pharaohs, perhaps to allow them to keep a clear head for ruling the land. During Prohibition there were a number of beers made without alcohol, but most disappeared from the market soon after repeal. One brand dating from that period, Goetz Pale Near Beer, made by the Pearl Brewing Company in San Antonio, Tex., is still available. But for most Americans, it was the introduction of nonalcoholic brands by three of the country's major beer producers several years ago that made such beverages acceptable. Industry analysts say that nonalcoholic wines were created largely to meet the demand of women who wanted an alternative to mineral water and soft drinks but didn't like the taste of beer. Now more and more bars and restaurants are stocking nonalcoholic beer or wine.</p>
        <p>Sales of these drinks have been growing rapidly. In 1989, 811,000 barrels of nonalcoholic beer were produced in the United States, accounting for less than one-half of 1 percent of the total beer market. By 1990, after the introduction of Sharp's by the Miller Brewing Company and O'Doul's by Anheuser-Busch, the market nearly doubled. Last fall Coors Cutter was added to the list, and an estimated 1.8 million barrels of nonalcoholic beer will be manufactured here this year. Production of nonalcoholic wines is much smaller -- experts don't expect it to exceed 500,000 cases this year. But the market has grown dramatically. For example, Ariel Vineyards, one of the largest makers of nonalcoholic wines, sold 143,000 cases last year, up from 10,865 in 1986.</p>
        <p>Advertising and promotion of nonalcoholic beer emphasize its positive attributes, such as its flavor and its compatibility with the desire to stay active and alert. The slogan for Sharp's, for example, is "keep your edge."</p>
        <p>In order to avoid confusion in the marketplace, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which controls the labeling of alcoholic beverages, has declared that nonalcoholic beer cannot be called beer. Beer with an alcohol content of less than one-half of 1 percent -- which means virtually all the brands on the market -- must be called brew, near-beer, nonalcoholic malt beverage or cereal beverage. Most companies, however, are choosing simply to use the name of the product. To be called alcohol-free, beer must contain no alcohol at all. The use of the term nonalcoholic wine was not affected by the bureau's ruling.</p>
        <p>NONALCOHOLIC beverages are not without controversy. Some experts, such as Patricia Taylor, director of alochol policies projects at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, are concerned that the beers may be perceived as "training beers" for young people. They say that for recovering alcoholics, these products may prompt the same undesirable, in some cases violent, behavior as drinks containing alochol.</p>
        <p>Another criticism has to do with flavor. All nonalcoholic drinks taste somewhat one-dimensional, like decaffeinated coffee, which is why some people say, why bother? Just as fat carries the flavor in food, alcohol is a conduit of flavor in many beverages. Therefore, in the absence of alcohol, wine and beer need strong flavors to start with. That's why nonalcoholic wines that are slightly sweet tend to taste more full-bodied.</p>
        <p>Thanks to modern technology, the flavor of nonalcoholic beverages is improving. Until recently, the conventional method for making them was to evaporate the volatile alcohol by heating it. But heating muddies the flavors. Products made with new methods, which arrest the formation of alcohol rather than remove it, have the best, most complex taste. Among the beers made this way are Haake Beck and Clausthaler from Germany, Ziegel Hof from Switzerland and Miller's Sharp's. Coors Cutter is brewed with yeasts that allow very little alcohol to form. Regardless of the technique used, the flavor of a nonalcoholic brew is determined to a large extent by its ingredients and the brewmaster's style. That's why most nonalcoholic American beers are lighter and blander than their European counterparts.</p>
        <p>In general, nonalcoholic red wines like cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc lack the complexity and balance of regular wines; they hold up better when paired with food than tasted alone. But some of the whites, such as chardonnay and riesling, with its touch of sweetness, make for very pleasant sipping. Ariel Blanc, a white table wine, won a gold medal at the Los Angeles County Fair in 1986 in blind-tasting competition with alcoholic wines. Champagne-style Ariel Brut and Blanc de Noirs are both extremely good, especially when consumed with canapes or other food. They are excellent to have on hand for special occasions when some guests might prefer not to drink alcohol.</p>
        <p>The same holds true for the beers. "You can fool a lot of people with the nonalcohol beers," sayd Deryl Seemayer, the president of Seemayer Associates in Stamford, Conn., which imports Ringnes Zero Plus, made in Norway. "They're gaining in acceptability because the technology has gotten better, so they taste better. You'll see nonalcoholic beers become trendy."</p>
