        <p>It's never too late to start a supergroup. John Hiatt, Ry Cooder and Nick Lowe, three songwriters and singers in their 40's with more than a dozen underappreciated albums among them, have joined the drummer Jim Keltner, a prolifically recorded studio musician, to form Little Village. The band received an uproarious welcome at the Beacon Theater on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Little Village, whose members first played together in 1986 for Mr. Hiatt's album "Bring the Family" (A&amp;M), arrives at a time when mainstream rock has moved far away from blues and country roots. As rock for younger listeners shifts away from cherished Americana and toward a dislocated, video-era fragmentation, older fans looking for stability and traditionalism have sparked country-music sales and nurtured a blues revival. Anyone who longs for a down-home guitar twang and a groove with a backbeat will find it in Little Village -- and get something extra, too.</p>

        <p>It's never too late to start a supergroup. John Hiatt, Ry Cooder and Nick Lowe, three songwriters and singers in their 40's with more than a dozen underappreciated albums among them, have joined the drummer Jim Keltner, a prolifically recorded studio musician, to form Little Village. The band received an uproarious welcome at the Beacon Theater on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Little Village, whose members first played together in 1986 for Mr. Hiatt's album "Bring the Family" (A&amp;M), arrives at a time when mainstream rock has moved far away from blues and country roots. As rock for younger listeners shifts away from cherished Americana and toward a dislocated, video-era fragmentation, older fans looking for stability and traditionalism have sparked country-music sales and nurtured a blues revival. Anyone who longs for a down-home guitar twang and a groove with a backbeat will find it in Little Village -- and get something extra, too.</p>
        <p>There's a modern self-consciousness amid the twang, because each of the band's three singers enjoys sly wordplay. Mr. Cooder has long been a collector of oddball Americana, proudly displaying old gospel or country songs based on peculiar conceits, while Mr. Lowe likes to put a new twist into rock and pop formulas from the 1960's and 70's. In songs that can be confessional or just funny, Mr. Hiatt brings wild-eyed leaps of logic to the structures of soul and country.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, however, the backbeat was the star. Little Village played like a band that's jamming on its repertory. Often the first verse of a song would be loose and casual, with Mr. Cooder plucking one of his loping, hole-in-the-middle guitar riffs as Mr. Keltner and Mr. Lowe on bass revved up the beat. By the time the second verse arrived, the whole band would be sharing the groove, and the rhythm would bounce or stroll with glee.</p>
        <p>Above the beat, Mr. Cooder would play leisurely slide-guitar solos that illuminated rhythmic crannies and moaned wordless secrets as they moseyed along. Mr. Hiatt, whose voice plunges into a baritone range and leaps to a heartfelt falsetto, did most of the singing, although Mr. Lowe and Mr. Cooder each took a few turns. As the two-hour set began, a shrill sound mix undermined the midrange, where the singing and guitar parts needed to interlock, but gradually the sound became warmer.</p>
        <p>The band played every song on its debut album, "Little Village" (Reprise/Time Warner), along with smart choices from the three singers' back catalogues, like Mr. Lowe's "Half a Boy and Half a Man" and Mr. Hiatt's "Thing Called Love." Paradoxically, the band rocked hardest on the members' older songs, as if its own material needed to be broken in. But Little Village is one band that recognized the value of experience.</p>
