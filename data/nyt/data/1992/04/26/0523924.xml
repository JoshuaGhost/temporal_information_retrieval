        <p>Ellen Hopkins's "Tales From the Baby Factory" (March 15) was a brave and honest article. Although it feels better to hear the success stories, there seem to be more stories of pain and despair.</p>
        <p>I, too, am a casualty of the technological advances in solving infertility issues.

We finally, with much torment and some relief, abandoned this path.</p>

        <p>Ellen Hopkins's "Tales From the Baby Factory" (March 15) was a brave and honest article. Although it feels better to hear the success stories, there seem to be more stories of pain and despair.</p>
        <p>I, too, am a casualty of the technological advances in solving infertility issues. My husband and I were diagnosed 10 years ago, and underwent attempts using Clomid, Perganol and HCG, numerous intrauterine inseminations (then called artificial inseminations), using donor sperm both frozen and "fresh," and, lastly, two very difficult cycles of in vitro fertilization. We finally, with much torment and some relief, abandoned this path.</p>
        <p>As I speak to other women who put themselves through some or all of what we did, I hear the same responses again and again. They all are waiting for a doctor to say: "That's it. That's all that modern medicine can do to try to make you pregnant." I have yet to hear of any doctor who is willing to give this final nod. There always seems to be one more avenue yet to be tried.There comes a time when we have to say, "No more." But it's hard not to feel that maybe this time it will work.</p>
        <p>I sat reading the article with my 3-month-old daughter on my lap and my 3 1/2-year-old daughter nearby and thought of how lucky we are. No, they are not my biological daughters, because we, like all those others, ultimately were unable to conceive. But we were able to adopt. That's our success story.</p>
        <p>This is not to imply that adoption is a quick and easy fix. It is anything but that. Unfortunately, there are many cases of failed attempts at adoption. My husband and I were lucky twice, but we were also unlucky once. And just as the family who experiences miscarriage grieves for the lost child, we too still think about the baby boy that we almost had but lost when his biological parents changed their minds at the last minute.</p>
        <p>The hope that buoyed us was the thought raised by our attorney that, once you've embarked on a search to adopt, you will. After years of hearing, "Maybe this time, your chances look good," it was nice to hear, with regard to adoption, "It's no longer a question of if you'll have a baby but rather when you will."
