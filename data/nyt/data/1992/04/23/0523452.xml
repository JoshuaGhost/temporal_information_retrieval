        <p>It looked like just another late night US Air connection between Pittsburgh and Washington. Then David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and failed candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, got on board. Then former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Democratic Presidential candidate, walked down the aisle.</p>
        <p>They met. They talked. The other passengers, already glassy-eyed as befits the 9:50 out of Pittsburgh on a rainy Tuesday night, looked like involuntary extras in an episode of "The Twilight Zone." As Jacques Barzaghi, Mr. Brown's semi-mystical adviser, put it, "It was a moment."</p>

        <p>It looked like just another late night US Air connection between Pittsburgh and Washington.

        <p>They met. They talked. The other passengers, already glassy-eyed as befits the 9:50 out of Pittsburgh on a rainy Tuesday night, looked like involuntary extras in an episode of "The Twilight Zone." As Jacques Barzaghi, Mr. Brown's semi-mystical adviser, put it, "It was a moment."</p>
        <p>Mr. Duke, on his way to Washington to withdraw from the race, took the initiative, rising from his seat and introducing himself as Mr. Brown got on board. "Hi, I'm David Duke," he said. "I was in the race myself for a while." Mr. Brown acknowledged him briefly, then took his seat, far in the back of the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Once the plane was airborne, Mr. Duke walked back to pursue the conversation, crouching in the aisle next to Mr. Brown and chattering away for most of the flight. The former Louisiana State Representative said later he talked about the flat tax, a proposal that both he and Mr. Brown support. Mr. Barzaghi, who was sitting near the two, said: "Jerry didn't say boo. He was sitting with a look of green on his face."</p>
        <p>Upon landing, the other passengers filed out, muttering that no one would believe them.</p>
