        <p>TO some people, they are just old stoves, a prosaic kitchen accouterment at best. But not to David Erickson, who restores and sells vintage cookers at Erickson's Antique Stoves in Littleton, Mass. "These things are mechanical works of art," he said. "They're gorgeous."</p>
        <p>The old stoves in question range from nickel-plated Victorian coal-burners to huge white 1950's models loaded with chrome. Cast-iron gas ranges from the 1920's are particularly distinctive, with an exposed, nickel-plated gas pipe on the front and stately Queen Anne legs. Stoves from the 30's are more streamlined and, with fewer surface details, easier to keep clean. And boxy 40's stoves look more like today's models.</p>

        <p>TO some people, they are just old stoves, a prosaic kitchen accouterment at best. But not to David Erickson, who restores and sells vintage cookers at Erickson's Antique Stoves in Littleton, Mass. "These things are mechanical works of art," he said. "They're gorgeous."</p>
        <p>The old stoves in question range from nickel-plated Victorian coal-burners to huge white 1950's models loaded with chrome. Cast-iron gas ranges from the 1920's are particularly distinctive, with an exposed, nickel-plated gas pipe on the front and stately Queen Anne legs. Stoves from the 30's are more streamlined and, with fewer surface details, easier to keep clean. And boxy 40's stoves look more like today's models.</p>
        <p>In recent years, old-fangled stoves have become increasingly popular in newfangled kitchens, notably in older houses and apartments where a retro kitchen looks comfortable. But the stove rehabilitation business extends to recent restaurant models, which have sleek contemporary lines and are designed for durability. Even 60's stoves in harvest green and yellow are being restored by their owners and, occasionally, selling to collectors.</p>
        <p>"Many people are distressed by the quality of new stoves," said Mr. Erickson, a stove restorer since 1980. "The old ones have a unique style and heavy-duty construction. They just need a good, solid tuneup every 40 to 50 years."</p>
        <p>A properly rehabilitated gas stove is essentially a new stove in an old body. Mr. Erickson, who completely dismantles each old stove, installs an automatic safety pilot; in bygone times, owners struck a match to light the oven. He also rebuilds old thermostats. If the original thermostat is still not reliable, he installs new components.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erickson, who handles stoves from the 1870's to the 1950's, became a stove enthusiast -- and restorer -- by chance. A former industrial arts instructor, he bought an old Victorian train depot, then fixed up a Victorian stove to heat it.</p>
        <p>These days, the depot is his workshop and showroom, where he has about 200 stoves. He can pick up and deliver stoves for repair nearly anywhere in New England, New York and New Jersey. Major repairs cost $500 to $3,000. Stoves rehabilitated by Mr. Erickson start at around $1,700.  First, Remove the Mice</p>
        <p>Gus Elias, a partner in Artco Restaurant Equipment Company, sells and restores mostly new and used commercial stoves. "People have been putting commercial stoves into their homes for about 10 years," he said. But his 12-year-old company also rehabilitates stoves from the 1930's through the 70's. A lot of things can be wrong with an old stove. Mice can eat away the insulation. And often an entire stainless steel side rots away, particularly if water has leaked onto it. Burners can also crack and warp from heat.</p>
        <p>Stove rehabilitation entails several basic steps. Grease is removed with a thick, non-abrasive solution. Grates and burners are sandblasted, then painted. Enamel must be repaired. And for newer stoves, a stainless steel exterior must be fashioned if the old one cannot be saved.</p>
        <p>If the proper parts are hard to find, Mr. Elias often fabricates replacements. But he needs to look at a stove to know whether he can repair it.</p>
        <p>Restoration costs about $400 and up. Back to Wood-Burners</p>
        <p>Bea Bryant rehabilitates antique stoves in the tiny town of Thorndike, Me. But her old stoves have been shipped all over the world. (Her company, Bryant Stoves/Music Inc., recently sent an old kitchen stove to Euro Disneyland outside Paris.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bryant, a stove collector for more than 40 years, deals mainly in stoves from the 1880's to 1930's. She also rehabilitates gas and wood combination stoves. Business took off in the early 70's when the energy crisis made the old models more economical, she said. "People needed cheap heat."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bryant, a past president of the Antique Stove Association, personally prefers very old models, including those from the 18th century. "The newer the stove, the plainer they got," she said. "People spent a lot of time designing the older ones."</p>
        <p>Her company, in business since the late 1960's, specializes in restoring Clarion, Atlantic and Kineo stoves, from old Maine companies founded in the mid-19th century. Her rehabilitated kitchen stoves start at $1,000. A free catalogue is available. Here's Where</p>
