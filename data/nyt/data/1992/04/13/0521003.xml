        <p>PEOPLE literally tighten their belts during a recession -- buying less expensive brands and foods, for instance -- much to the misfortune of investors in supermarket companies.</p>
        <p>During 1991, supermarket stocks had a poor year, appreciating less than 4 percent while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 26 percent. Now, with signs of life in the economy, some investors are warily considering the food retailers.</p>
        <p>Not Kimberly K. Walin, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, who warns that these companies may lag the market as the economy picks up because inflation is expected to stay at low levels. Low inflation makes it harder for grocers to increase sales by passing along price increases.</p>
        <p>"These stocks are dependent on inflation to a certain extent," Ms. Walin said. She is recommending only one supermarket stock, Albertson's Inc., which is expanding to new regions.</p>
        <p>Others are more optimistic. "There are some real buying opportunities," said Debra Levin, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. She recommends American Stores, Kroger and Safeway. Still, she warned, "the near-term trends are terrible."</p>
        <p>Last week, Food Lion Inc., one of the better performers in the industry, reported disappointing March sales results.</p>
        <p>George E. Thompson, an analyst with Prudential Securities, is betting that consolidation will result in a small group of increasingly large and profitable supermarket operators that will breeze past the rest of the pack.</p>
        <p>"We believe investors who pick the right names will achieve returns on investment comparable with those provided by the consumer-staple powerhouses such as Coca-Cola and Anheuser-Busch," Mr. Thompson said in a recent report.</p>
        <p>The notion of grocery chains delivering returns like those of premier growth stocks is not as unlikely as it appears at first glance. Although the supermarket industry, with its plodding growth, has never captivated investors, it has been a more than respectable investment over time. In fact, 1991 was the first time in seven years that the food retailing stocks failed to outperform the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>But investors must be careful because store operators face threats beyond low inflation.</p>
        <p>Warehouse clubs, with no frills and low prices, are siphoning off a larger piece of the food retailing pie. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, and the Kmart Corporation, the second largest, are pushing into the grocery business. And even supermarket operators that do not compete with warehouses are locked in price wars with rivals in order to keep customers coming in.</p>
        <p>And a potential new threat has arisen. In an attempt to get more consistent pricing on its products, the Procter &amp; Gamble Company is cutting back on the deals and promotional payments it makes to supermarkets to carry and prominently display its goods. Many supermarkets have come to rely on promotional payments for a significant share of their profits. If Procter &amp; Gamble's strategy becomes widely adopted, it is unclear what it will mean for the profitability of supermarkets.</p>
        <p>The two chains attracting the most attention are Albertson's and the Hannaford Brothers Company.</p>
        <p>Hannaford, based in Portland, Me., runs nearly 90 food stores in New England, many under the Shop &amp; Save name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson of Prudential forecasts Hannaford's earnings will grow by 20 to 25 percent a year for the next five years. Much of the growth, he said, will come from opening new stores and productivity improvements. Even though Hannaford is dependent on the shaky New England economy, Prudential believes the stock could gain considerably this year. Hannaford closed Friday at $25, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, is expected to expand rapidly. Last year, the company announced plans for its first major acquisition, agreeing to buy 74 Jewel/Osco stores from the American Stores Company. The combination drug and food stores have $1.5 billion in sales and will greatly bolster the company's presence in Texas and Florida. Prudential has a 12-month target price of $56 for Albertson's, which closed at $42.625 Friday, up 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
