        <p>Donald V. Fites winced when asked if the bitter dispute between 12,000 striking members of the United Automobile Workers union and Caterpillar Inc., was likely to have sweeping consequences for labor-management relations.

        <p>Donald V. Fites winced when asked if the bitter dispute between 12,000 striking members of the United Automobile Workers union and Caterpillar Inc., was likely to have sweeping consequences for labor-management relations. Instead, the chairman of the giant construction machinery company said, it is merely a labor dispute -- though a formidable one -- with ramifications confined to one company.</p>
        <p>"I don't think this thing has any larger ramifications," Mr. Fites said. "I believe that view is being put on by the United Auto Workers in an effort to try to whip up the passions of our employees and to try to make them feel that they have broader support.</p>
        <p>"I find it inconceivable that for the mighty United Auto Workers union, with 900,000 members, and we, with less than 2 percent of that, that this is a life or death thing for the U.A.W. I don't believe it is."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fites's opinion is apparently not widely held. Many company executives, academics, analysts and Mr. Fites's counterparts in the industry as well as labor leaders contend that the Caterpillar chairman is presiding over the most important labor battle in years. As the two sides prepare to sit down with a Federal mediator on Monday, the dispute is being eagerly watched to see how it will be resolved and who will be most deeply shaken by its outcome. 'We're at an Impasse'</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites, in a recent interview at the company's headquarters here, said Caterpillar's aim remained to have its striking workers return, despite the company's pledge to hire nonunion workers as permanent replacements for workers who remain on strike.</p>
        <p>He contrasted the strike with that of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization a decade ago when President Ronald Reagan replaced the strikers, saying: "This is not the Patco of the 90's. Our objective is to get our employees back to work. Every day there are more of them coming back, and that's positive.</p>
        <p>"But we're at an impasse. I suppose if the United Auto Workers could come forth with a new proposal that was near our final proposal then the impasse would be over."</p>
        <p>Union leaders have maintained that Caterpillar's insistence that its offer is final makes a union proposal futile. And union members, who have largely continued to defy the company's ultimatum, continue their picketing, both at the plants throughout Peoria and outside the company's downtown headquarters. By the slogans on the picket signs -- "Get the Fites Out of Caterpillar," and "Will Rogers Never Met Don Fites" -- the target of their anger is the 58-year-old Caterpillar chairman.</p>
        <p>It is an unusual position for Mr. Fites, a marketing man who has been widely known and recognized in the company for his capacity to forge harmonious relations with colleagues and workers alike at Caterpillar, where he has worked for the last 36 years. His colleagues attribute that skill in part to Mr. Fites's upbringing on a farm in northwestern Indiana and his 16 years in Caterpillar positions in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia, where he made it a point to understand the cultural differences in the workplace. 'So Good With People'</p>
        <p>"One of the real strengths about Don is that he is so good with people and he cares so much about the workers," said Robert H. Coyle, a retired Caterpillar marketing executive for whom Mr. Fites once worked. "He really takes time to get to know people and to ask about their families. And that's what I think bothers him most about the situation. It's what gives him the most pressure."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites, a tall former high school basketball player who was often mistaken in foreign countries for the actor Gene Hackman, insists that his company's hard stance in the labor dispute is simply an effort to enable Caterpillar to attack the practice of "pattern bargaining," in which a union's labor pact with one company sets a standard for bargaining for other companies in that industry.</p>
        <p>In that context, Mr. Fites denies that Caterpillar's stand is meant to represent a philosophical position for all of industry, in particular the Big Three automobile makers in Detroit. "We have to be globally competitive and that's why we're taking this stand," he said. "There is no company like Caterpillar in the United States and certainly no company like Caterpillar with United Auto Workers representation.</p>
        <p>"We've decided as a long-term strategy that we're going to stay in the good old U.S.A. and we're going to compete globally from this manufacturing base. This is our message." Drive to Compete Globally</p>
        <p>It is just that position on global competition and attack on costs that has motivated Mr. Fites for years, starting long before he was elected chairman of Caterpillar two years ago. In its effort to push productivity and to remain competitive with its arch rival, Komatsu Ltd., of Japan, the company began a modernization program five years ago called "Plant with a Future." That program, which is intended to cut Caterpillar's costs, entailed heavy spending on new equipment and plant modernization. The company also reorganized, giving more autonomy to individual divisions to cut response time, but also cutting 1,000 jobs as a consequence. It was Mr. Fites who led that reorganization.</p>
        <p>For Caterpillar, which sells 59 percent of its trucks and excavators overseas, being competitive with foreign makers of that same equipment has been crucial. And Mr. Fites has been a champion of international free trade.</p>
        <p>"We always tell the U.S. Government, 'For heaven's sake, don't try to help us by putting up some protective barriers because as soon as you do that, your costs go up and you're that much less globally competitive,' " Mr. Fites said. "The other fallacy of protectionism is that if we think we can protect the automobile industry in this country or any other industry -- in this day and age in this world, I can't see protectionism working."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites has long been known as a strong advocate of free trade and was active last year in campaigning against the extension of steel import quotas, which expired two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites says he sees the United Automobile Workers as favoring protectionism because "I feel they believe that if they can put this protectionist wall around the automotive industry in the United States then perhaps their chances of maintaining the pattern bargaining process will be better."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites graduated from Valparaiso University with a degree in civil engineering and joined Caterpillar soon after graduation in 1956. He received a master's degree in management in 1971 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a Sloan Fellow. He has worked in management positions in South Africa, as marketing director of Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. in Tokyo and as president of Caterpillar Brazil S.A. in Sao Paulo, before returning here in 1981, when he became corporate vice president, and executive vice president in 1985.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fites has presided over Caterpillar operations during economic fluctuation in Brazil, during social upheaval in South Africa and during recessions at home. As challenges go, he says the current labor dispute "would rank up there with some of the more interesting and exciting ones." But he added, "It's not a challenge that we don't think we're capable of addressing."</p>
        <p>He said his wife and his 27-year-old daughter had been supportive. "They think we're doing what we have to to keep the company globally competitive," Mr. Fites said.</p>
        <p>The one exception, perhaps, Mr. Fites suggested, is his 91-year-old father, who continues to live in rural northwest Indiana. When asked if his father shared his views on Caterpillar's strategy with the labor union, Mr. Fites paused for a moment. "My father has been a farmer all of his life and so he has good common sense," Mr. Fites said.</p>
        <p>He then added quickly, with a smile: "I doubt he has an appreciation for all the things that take place in a situation like this. He makes his observations."</p>
