        <p>Moments before she kills a policeman with a corncob snatched from a dinner plate, Mary Brady (Alice Krige), a fiend in human form, utters the only witty lines to be heard in "Stephen King's Sleepwalkers." "No vegetables, no dessert!" she growls.  "Those are the rules."</p>
        <p>The film, which opened today at local theaters, follows the mayhem wrought by Mary and her son Charles (Brian Krause) when they arrive in the small town of Travis, Ind. Both mother and son are Sleepwalkers, werewolflike creatures condemned to feed on the life force of beautiful young women to stay alive. They are also lovers. Before dispatching her son to find a fresh young victim, Mary entices Charles to slow dance with her to his favorite song, "Sleep Walk" (what else?), the 1959 hit by the Brooklyn guitar duo Santo and Johnny.</p>

        <p>Moments before she kills a policeman with a corncob snatched from a dinner plate, Mary Brady (Alice Krige), a fiend in human form, utters the only witty lines to be heard in "Stephen King's Sleepwalkers." "No vegetables, no dessert!" she growls.  "Those are the rules."</p>
        <p>The film, which opened today at local theaters, follows the mayhem wrought by Mary and her son Charles (Brian Krause) when they arrive in the small town of Travis, Ind. Both mother and son are Sleepwalkers, werewolflike creatures condemned to feed on the life force of beautiful young women to stay alive. They are also lovers. Before dispatching her son to find a fresh young victim, Mary entices Charles to slow dance with her to his favorite song, "Sleep Walk" (what else?), the 1959 hit by the Brooklyn guitar duo Santo and Johnny.</p>
        <p>"Am I beautiful?" she demands. "You're always beautiful, Mother," he replies. "I'm famished," she reminds him. Pale and gaunt, with glittering eyes and a provocative swivel, Ms. Krige is an all-too-predictable Hollywood incarnation of a Freudian nightmare come to life.</p>
        <p>Tanya Robertson (Madchen Amick), the classmate Charles selects to be his next victim, is something of a soulmate. Since Tanya likes to photograph gravestones, what better place for a first date with Charles than the local cemetery? But in the middle of a kiss, he clenches down a bit too hard, and the perfect teen-age romance turns into horror.</p>
        <p>The movie is filled with felines. It seems that the only things that Sleepwalkers fear are cats, which would like to tear them to pieces. That's why the Brady front yard teems with them. They are waiting for a denouement that, when it arrives, is anticlimactic.  "Sleepwalkers" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It</p>
        <p>includes scenes of nudity, sex and violence.</p>
