        <p>When Gregory J. Kottke opened his bodyguard agency here a few weeks ago, he figured most of his clients would be professional athletes, wealthy business executives and maybe a visiting rock star or two.</p>
        <p>It has not worked out that way. Most of his clients are women with low incomes, frightened faces and sad stories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kottke has become a bodyguard for battered women.</p>
        <p>"My phone has been ringing off the hook," he said. "There are a lot of scared and abused women out there."</p>
        <p>In an unusual experiment and partnership, perhaps the only one like it in the country, Mr. Kottke has joined forces with a local women's group, the Task Force on Battered Women, to protect physically abused women in their homes and even in the halls of the county courthouse, the scene of a recent murder that shook Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>It is an alliance forged out of necessity, fear and a deepening frustration with the legal system, said Barbara Pollack, the coordinator of the group's legal advocacy program.</p>
        <p>"Domestic violence is not a priority with the police or with the courts here or anywhere else in the country," Ms. Pollack said. "So we're getting a profesional bodyguarding agency to do what the system is not doing: protecting battered women."</p>
        <p>One example, she said, was the March 9 attack on a 51-year-old woman, Shirley Lowery. She was stabbed to death in the courthouse here as she sought an injunction against her estranged boyfriend. The man was arrested minutes after the stabbing.</p>
        <p>The bodyguards had helped Ms. Lowery move to a secret apartment a few days before she was killed, but she did not call them to escort her to the courthouse, her daughter, Vannessa Davis, said, because she thought she would be safe there.</p>
        <p>Mary Pat Brygger of the National Woman Abuse Prevention Center in Wahington said she knew of no other advocacy group in the country using professional bodyguards to shield victims of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>"Most programs are so overwhelmed and underfunded," she said. "There are so many needs. But I think it's a wonderful idea. I hope it can spread."</p>
        <p>Lieut. Samuel M. Leatherwood, a spokesman for the Milwaukee County Sheriff, said that in a majority of domestic abuse cases bodyguards are not necessary or even wise. "Overall, the system works pretty well to protect these women," he said.</p>
        <p>"But the bodyguards are probably doing some good," the lieutenant added. "How much is hard to say. Whether having a bodyguard around makes the man more irate or more determined to get the women at some other time has to be measured, too. It can be a very complicated and dangerous situation."</p>
        <p>Two months ago, to help get their business off the ground, Mr. Kottke and his business partner, Aubrey McCroy, contacted the battered women's group and offered their services. At first the executive director, Deborah Neas, thought it was a joke, and besides, she said, the group could not afford to pay them much, if anything.</p>
        <p>But she met with them, and they said they would base their fees on a sliding scale. Their typical rate is $30 an hour, but poor women pay nothing and most of their clients are poor. So far, they have worked with about a dozen women. To make ends meet, Mr. Kottke and Mr. McCroy are relying on their families and friends.</p>
        <p>Ms. Neas said, "So far the response has been very favorable," adding, "I think both Greg and Aubrey are incredibly sensitive."</p>
        <p>Their sensitivity came the hard way. The two men, both of them big and brawny, and their colleague, Connie Mars, have all known domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kottke's wife had been abused by a boyfriend, and "seven years later she's still dealing with it, we're still dealing with it," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCroy had watched his father beat his mother for years until he stood up to him when he was 14 years old. "I was a big kid," he said.</p>
        <p>And a few years ago Ms. Mars lived with a man who, she said, frequently followed a simple routine: He would come home from work, drink a six-pack of beer and beat her up.</p>
        <p>"These women live with fear 24 hours a day," Ms. Mars said. "I've been there. And if I can help ease that fear for a little while, that makes me feel good."</p>
        <p>The other day, the bodyguards escorted a frightened, dark-haired 21-year-old woman from the county welfare office to the courthouse to file a restraining order against her boyfriend.</p>
        <p>Full of beer and anger, the boyfriend had stabbed the woman in the throat on Valentine's Day. Two weeks before that attack, he had kicked her down a flight of stairs. At the time, she was four months pregnant with his baby.</p>
        <p>After the stabbing, the woman spent a month in the hospital, where a counselor told her about the bodyguards.</p>
        <p>"I was scared to go home," the woman said. "I didn't know what he would do. So I called them."</p>
        <p>She said her boyfriend saw Mr. Kottke with her a few days ago and asked, " 'Who's the big guy?' "</p>
        <p>"I told him, 'That was my bodyguard,' " she said. "I got the impression that he wasn't going to bother me anymore."</p>
        <p>Still, the fear remains. So Mr. Kottke and Mr. McCroy walked the woman to an office in the courthouse here to join a group of other women who were getting tips on how to file restraining orders. Last year, 6,000 women sought restraining orders in Milwaukee County.</p>
        <p>As bodyguards stood nearby, a clinic staff member helped the women fill out the forms. The women, sitting around a scarred table, were black, white and Hispanic. They were middle-aged and barely out of their teens. Two were pregnant.</p>
        <p>All said they were scared.</p>
        <p>"I don't see what purpose this serves," one woman said, looking over the restraining order form. "If he's going to get you, he's going to get you."</p>
        <p>"That's what I'm afraid of," someone else said. "But we have to do something."</p>
