        <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia took command of the former Soviet army stationed in Moldova today, just as 10 people were killed in a skirmish between the Moldovan police and separatists in a region inhabited mainly by ethnic Russians.</p>

        <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia took command of the former Soviet army stationed in Moldova today, just as 10 people were killed in a skirmish between the Moldovan police and separatists in a region inhabited mainly by ethnic Russians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin's decree moving the 14th Guards Army from the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Independent States to that of Russia also came as representatives from Moldova, Romania, Ukraine and Russia sought to negotiate a solution to a conflict that has become one of the fiercest ethnic battles in the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Early today, the Moldovan police stormed the town of Bendery, near the Dniester River, killing 10 people, several news reports said. Moldova has been under a state of emergency since Saturday.</p>
        <p>Within Russia, Mr. Yeltsin continues to face resistance in some autonomous region, including Chechen-Ingushetia in the North Caucasus region where President Dzhokhar Dudayev survived an aborted opposition takeover on Tuesday. Five people were reported killed there before Mr. Dudayev imposed a state of emergency.</p>
        <p>Today, 1,000 people rallied in the capital, Grozny, calling for Chechen independence from Russia, news reports said.</p>
        <p>Despite the signing on Tuesday of a new federal treaty linking the constituent parts of the Russian federation, Mr. Yeltsin faces problems in granting local nationalities enough autonomy to satisfy them without sacrificing the unity of the Russian state. The estimated 25 million ethnic Russian living outside Russia's borders present another political problem, easily manipulated by Russian nationalists.</p>
        <p>Russia's plans to form its own national army, announced two weeks ago, already appear to be taking shape. A draft proposal for a new army of 1.2 million to 1.3 million people is expected to be delivered to the Russian Parliament soon.</p>
        <p>With his decree today, Mr. Yeltsin appeared to be asserting Russia's control over an army that under commonwealth command had been in danger of unraveling in a dangerous place. The reports of Mr. Yeltsin's decree did not make clear what he intended to do with the troops in Moldova.</p>
        <p>The Moldovan Ministry of Defense, which had been pressing for the neutrality of commonwealth forces, tonight protested against Mr. Yeltsin's decree, the evening television news reported.</p>
        <p>Moldova, situated between Romania and Ukraine in the southwest corner of the old Soviet Union, has been contending with challenges from both its Russian-speaking population, located in the Transdniester region, and by the Gagauz, a Turkic-speaking group that has also tried to declare its auotonmy from Moldova.</p>
        <p>Fighting in the Transdniester region, an industrial area on the eastern bank of the Dniester River, has already cost more than 50 lives. On occasion, volunteers from self-styled Cossack units from the Don region in southern Russia have come to the aid of the local Russians, adding another volatile element to the conflict.</p>
        <p>Fear of reunification of Moldova with Romania is one reason for Transdniester's attempt to seek autonomy from Moldova; another has been laws making Romanian the official language of Moldova.</p>
