        <p>President Bush tonight signed a bill that extends foreign aid for six months. Earlier theSenate, resisting popular sentiment against such aid, approved the $14.2 billion measure but pared an Administration request for money for United Nations peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>The bill passed 84 to 16 after Senate leaders reached a compromise on loan guarantees to Israel. The White House had threatened a veto if the guarantees were included because Israel refused to halt new settlements in the occupied territories.</p>

        <p>President Bush tonight signed a bill that extends foreign aid for six months. Earlier theSenate, resisting popular sentiment against such aid, approved the $14.2 billion measure but pared an Administration request for money for United Nations peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>The bill passed 84 to 16 after Senate leaders reached a compromise on loan guarantees to Israel. The White House had threatened a veto if the guarantees were included because Israel refused to halt new settlements in the occupied territories.</p>
        <p>Senators who back the loan guarantees settled for a separate, nonbinding resolution expressing their support for "appropriate loan guarantees" that passed 99 to 1.</p>
        <p>The foreign aid bill, already approved by the House in a slightly different form, cuts assistance by $1.2 billion, or 8 percent, from the 1991 fiscal year. The two houses sliced $1.1 billion from the 1992 request. The bill provides $270 million for a broad range of United Nations peacekeeping missions, $80 million less than President Bush asked.</p>
        <p>Congress also severely limited arms aid to El Salvador, reducing the Administration's $85 million request to $21.3 million.</p>
