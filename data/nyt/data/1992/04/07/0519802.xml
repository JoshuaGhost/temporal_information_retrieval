        <p>Denver Broncos running back BOBBY HUMPHREY arrived at the Atlanta Falcons headquarters at Suwanee, Ga., yesterday for a physical, and he may work out for the team today.</p>
        <p>Humphrey has been granted permission to speak to clubs interested in him, in advance of a possible trade.</p>
        <p>Falcons officials said that if the physical went well and insurance concerns were resolved, the former Alabama star might be tested today by Atlanta's personnel director, KEN HEROCK.</p>
        <p>"We always check out any options available to us regarding good football players," Herock said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Humphrey rushed for 1,000 yards in two of his three seasons with the Broncos. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: PRO FOOTBALL</p>
