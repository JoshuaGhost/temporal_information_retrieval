        <p>Given a music world in which the song recital is a shrinking market, we should be grateful for a week of German lieder that began with Elly Ameling singing Schubert and ended with Mitsuko Shirai singing almost everyone else. Miss Shirai's program with Hartmut Holl at Weill Recital Hall on Friday night moved from Brahms to Schumann to Strauss and ended with Schoenberg's "Jane Grey" and five items by Hugo Wolf.</p>
        <p>When we talk of collaboration between singer and accompanist there is often more lip service than substance behind the words, but in the case of these two musicians, collaboration is the only correct term. Schumann's "Frauenliebe und Leben" was indeed the work of foils: Miss Shirai's elegant conception of phrase and Romantic intensity played against the piano's dry, clear textures. This was piano playing that measured the music's inherent sentiment and added no more to it when no more was needed. Perhaps the exception was in the "Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan," in which the singer's exceedingly slow tempos and Mr. Holl's space-age interpretation created shock-attack chords, unexpected pauses and skeletal timbres.</p>

        <p>When we talk of collaboration between singer and accompanist there is often more lip service than substance behind the words, but in the case of these two musicians, collaboration is the only correct term. Schumann's "Frauenliebe und Leben" was indeed the work of foils: Miss Shirai's elegant conception of phrase and Romantic intensity played against the piano's dry, clear textures. This was piano playing that measured the music's inherent sentiment and added no more to it when no more was needed. Perhaps the exception was in the "Nun hast du mir den ersten Schmerz getan," in which the singer's exceedingly slow tempos and Mr. Holl's space-age interpretation created shock-attack chords, unexpected pauses and skeletal timbres.</p>
        <p>Miss Shirai's attractions are not really in the voice itself. Her mezzo-soprano fades at both extremes of its range and is subject to curiously recessed vowel sounds. She is able to fill with sound a small hall of under 300 seats, but one cannot imagine this kind of voice functioning well in a space much bigger.</p>
        <p>On the other hand Miss Shirai and Mr. Holl share their individual thoughtfulness and have made serious mutual decisions. They take turns balancing passion with clearheadedness: Mr. Holl's delicate reticence in "Susser Freund, du blickest" or Miss Shirai's cool symmetry of phrase in "Du Ring an meinem Finger." At every moment of the evening one felt the weight of intelligent and diligent study, yet it was music-making that has used calculation to a point and then gone beyond it.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, there were Strauss's "Ophelia" Songs, frantic and half mad, and then an example of the younger Schoenberg. Here he is still in the grip of tonality but in this grimly effusive executioner's song, the personality is already well formed.</p>
