        <p>Old speechwriters wait for</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>speech one that a politician knows by heart and believes moves his audiences -- to see if candidates grasp the dynamic of their own campaigns.</p>
        <p>Voters don't get to see it in full on television. George Bush has only just hired Peggy Noonan to put his together. But Bill Clinton has been out on the stump hammering his message out, and The New York Times published the text just before his Pennsylvania victory.</p>
        <p>"We have had it their way for 11 years," he says, picking up speed after a slow, statistical start, "and we're going downhill as a nation. The middle class is collapsing. Poverty is exploding. What is the alternative? That's what I represent."</p>
        <p>He then presents an inchoate economic plan he calls "dramatically different" (a modifying phrase he ought to drop because women know it as the name of an Estee Lauder moisturizing lotion). His anti-tax-and-spend idea needs beefing up and tying into his central theme, which is a call to responsibility.</p>
        <p>That theme, original for a Democrat, will blend nicely with time-for-a-change and don't-waste-your-vote messages in October. But as he turns to health care, Mr. Clinton fails to punch up the difference to consumers between his centralized plan and the more diffuse Republican approach.</p>
        <p>Not until "what you earn depends on what you can learn" does he hit oratorical stride. Clinton has a constructive idea to bring a college education to those who cannot afford it: a "national service trust fund," or new G.I. Bill. Students could repay the Federal Government for an education with a year or two at low-pay, high-involvement local public service.</p>
        <p>A domestic Peace Corps with an education bonus is not a new idea, but its combination of idealism and practicality fits his educational responsibility theme: "I live in a state where we can fine parents if they won't show up when their kids are in trouble in school. A lot of people think that's harsh. . . ." Not most voters, as the speaker knows; we like making other parents more responsible for their kids.</p>
        <p>Then he gets personal, responding to the "cop-out" of those who say "all the politicians are a bunch of bums and the country can't work anymore." The only major Presidential candidate who is neither a millionaire nor a billionaire recounts being raised by grandparents while his widowed mother went to school to become a nurse, and tells how he borrowed from the Government to go to college, working through law school to pay it back.</p>
        <p>Governor Clinton does not dwell on this, but most Americans identify with someone who had to make his own way. It sets the stage for a powerful peroration, replete with train whistles in the night, which the speaker does not yet have, but the campaign is young.</p>
        <p>What else is missing? Clinton's "the" speech needs both a differentiation and an attack.</p>
        <p>He should clearly draw the difference between Mr. Bush and himself on abortion. A centrist, discourage-but-permit stand will reach deep into the Bush core support among conservative women; the Supreme Court will make it the sleeper issue in the '92 campaign.</p>
        <p>The attack can be on Mr. Bush's claim to fame: his defeat of Saddam Hussein. Only now are we beginning to discover the extent to which the secret Bush National Security Directive 26 -- which the White House should be challenged to make public -- helped build the Iraqi dictator into a world menace.</p>
        <p>No wonder Mr. Bush reacted to Iraqi aggression with such uncharacteristic alacrity. The loyal opposition might point out that the monstrous nuclear threat that it took a half-million American warriors to defeat was in effect financed by Bush blindness and appeasement.</p>
        <p>Development of the "the" speeches of candidates is a marvelous thing to watch. We will see their summer blossoming at the conventions, in acceptance form; catch their essence this fall in summations at the end of television debates; and watch their culmination on election eve.</p>
        <p>"The beginning of everything," concludes Mr. Clinton, becoming a happier warrior, "is believing that we can do better."</p>
        <p>He has a good, inspiring "the" speech. I believe he can do better.</p>
