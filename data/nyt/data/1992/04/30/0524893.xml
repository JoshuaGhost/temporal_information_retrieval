        <p>Harvey Myerson, a lawyer widely known for his flamboyant style in and out of court, was convicted yesterday of defrauding some of his clients of more than $2 million but was acquitted of defrauding his law firm of an additional $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myerson, a short, stocky 52-year-old corporate lawyer who acted as his own defense attorney, was found guilty of five charges and not guilty of five others at the end of his six-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>Harvey Myerson, a lawyer widely known for his flamboyant style in and out of court, was convicted yesterday of defrauding some of his clients of more than $2 million but was acquitted of defrauding his law firm of an additional $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myerson, a short, stocky 52-year-old corporate lawyer who acted as his own defense attorney, was found guilty of five charges and not guilty of five others at the end of his six-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>"I am innocent of all the charges," Mr. Myerson said afterward, asserting that the case was "a setup from day one." He said he was "very, very encouraged" by the jury's verdict and expected to reverse his partial conviction on appeal.</p>
        <p>The chief prosecutor, Sean F. O'Shea, said Mr. Myerson could face a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine when sentenced by Judge Edward R. Korman. No sentencing date was set yesterday. Mr. O'Shea added that the verdict was important because it involved fraud in "a top-flight law firm." Avoided Cross-Examination</p>
        <p>The trial focused on accusations that Mr. Myerson charged a wide range of personal expenses to his Park Avenue firm, Myerson &amp; Kuhn, and bilked several clients by repeatedly inflating legal fees before the firm went bankrupt two years ago.</p>
        <p>Members of the jury, which deliberated for five days, said afterward that they acquitted Mr. Myerson of defrauding his firm because his partners did not complain about the expenses he was charging until the investigation began. They said they convicted him of counts where he had to be aware of inflated bills mailed to clients.</p>
        <p>By questioning witnesses and giving the defense's opening and closing statements in the trial, Mr. Myerson was able to tell his side of the story directly to the jury without taking the witness stand and without undergoing cross-examination.</p>
        <p>He portrayed himself as victim, rather than villain, contending that some junior partners fraudulently overcharged the law firm's clients then blamed him and testified against him "with a pat on the back from the Government."</p>
        <p>He also complained that the Government intimidated and coerced his former secretary into lying about him. Central Figure in Cases</p>
        <p>The prosecutors, Mr. O'Shea and Mark Kirsch, presented several of Mr. Myerson's former partners to testify that Mr. Myerson had ordered them to inflate legal bills and systematically charge clients for many hours that were never worked. Mr. Myerson's former secretary and clients also testified for the prosecution.</p>
        <p>Highlighting Mr. Myerson's lavish style of living, the prosecution contended that he diverted money from his firm and clients to pay his personal expenses for everything from minor household items to vacations, costly clothing and an $86,000 diamond ring.</p>
        <p>Two more Federal indictments are pending in Brooklyn against Mr. Myerson, who now lives in Key West, Fla. One indictment charges him with a fraudulent scheme to finance his $1.75 million home in Key West. The other charges him with filing a false tax return for 1986.</p>
        <p>As a result of having served as a major partner in two of the biggest law firms ever to file for bankruptcy, Mr. Myerson became the central figure in some of the most bitter legal wrangling in recent years. Like a 'Cash Machine'</p>
        <p>He was managing partner of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey, which went into bankruptcy in 1987 as Mr. Myerson departed with many of the old firm's lawyers. He established Myerson &amp; Kuhn with Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, in December 1987.</p>
        <p>The trial involved charges that he cheated his partners and clients at Myerson &amp; Kuhn, which went into bankruptcy at the end of 1989.</p>
        <p>In the prosecution's summation last week, Mr. O'Shea said the defendant treated the Myerson &amp; Kuhn firm like his personal "candy store" and its clients like a "cash machine." He derisively described Mr. Myerson as "one of the self-proclaimed best lawyers in America."</p>
        <p>Mr. Myerson was convicted of defrauding four clients -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., the Home Insurance Company and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. He was acquitted of defrauding the Kelley Oil Companies and the New York State Urban Development Corporation, as well as his firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myerson delivered an emotional summation, arguing that the prosecutors went after him because they wanted to get "a big flamboyant Jewish lawyer." He assailed the case against him as a "sham."</p>
