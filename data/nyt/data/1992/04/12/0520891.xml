        <p>Town Supervisor Paul J. Feiner of Greenburgh can do no right, according to the article "From Gadfly to Supervisor, a Rocky Path for Feiner" on March 29.</p>
        <p>As an example, it reports that one policy that generates "intensely negative reaction is his prohibition of driving town cars home at night" and says this policy has been linked to destruction of vehicles at the town garage, even though five out of six such vehicles were vandalized before Mr. Feiner took office. It adds that Mr. Feiner's private car was vandalized during his first month in office, the implication being that he somehow brought it on himself.</p>

        <p>Town Supervisor Paul J. Feiner of Greenburgh can do no right, according to the article "From Gadfly to Supervisor, a Rocky Path for Feiner" on March 29.</p>
        <p>As an example, it reports that one policy that generates "intensely negative reaction is his prohibition of driving town cars home at night" and says this policy has been linked to destruction of vehicles at the town garage, even though five out of six such vehicles were vandalized before Mr. Feiner took office. It adds that Mr. Feiner's private car was vandalized during his first month in office, the implication being that he somehow brought it on himself.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Feiner had stickers put on town cars that requested reports of non-business use of cars. The Town Clerk, Susan Tolchin, objects to this, complaining that it implies a mistrust of employees. Why does Ms. Tolchin object to strict adherence to guidelines? It saves taxpayers' money and surely would not insult honest employees.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Feiner is criticized for hiring a black management consultant because the appointment led to a menacing racist phone call to Town Hall. Should we then blame Mr. Feiner for hiring the man?</p>
        <p>Ms. Tolchin is also annoyed with Mr. Feiner because of a joke he made at a town meeting before an auction of surplus town vehicles. When the Town Supervisor auctioned off his tie for $15 and joked, "Do we take Visa?" Ms. Tolchin complains, "The tie incident was too much. I have concerns that everything seems like a media presentation." From my perspective, this seems like a pretty harmless joke.</p>
        <p>Then Councilman Pat Pilla throws in his objection to Mr. Feiner's father, an accountant, volunteering at no charge to review the town's books. I wish Mr. Pilla had been more specific in explaining his objections to this. Shouldn't we be grateful for the help of citizens who donate their time and expertise to benefit the county?</p>
        <p>Further complaints of Mr. Feiner's using police as process servers to save the town $1,200 a year, or accusations that he sometimes "pressed too hard to cut through red tape on a constituent's behalf" leave one wondering what the reporter is so upset about. What is wrong with saving money? And why not cut through wasteful and needless bureaucracy?</p>
        <p>In the current era of widespread mistrust of government and politicians, rampant misuse of perquisites by those in power and elected officials who worry more about their own interests than the welfare of those who put them in office, Mr. Feiner has his priorities straight, and I say more power to him.
