        <p>To the Editor: My husband and I have recently returned from a delightful two-week vacation in Paris. We hope to return. "Hope" is important, as we are both well into our 70's. However, our vacation was marred by the airports.</p>
        <p>We flew American Airlines both ways. The crews on both flights were attentive and gracious.</p>
        <p>But when we arrived at Orly, we, with our below-average amount of baggage, were alone in a cavernous space and, finally, after walking aimlessly, including staircases, finally found a passport window that was not marked "ferme."</p>
        <p>After the eight-hour return trip in an air-conditioned plane, we were herded into a rather narrow, hot and airless space that continued for what seemed miles before we came to the baggage carousel. During this trek, we had to stop several times to rest. No employees of American or anyone at Kennedy to aid and assist. On this hot, airless trek my husband became ill, but, fortunately, at this writing, he has recaptured his energetic and happy demeanor, and we can now reminisce about hope of return, but not to Orly or Kennedy, if we can help it.</p>
        <p>We object to the cold, artless, actually ugly atmosphere of both Orly and Kennedy, and the disregard for the health and comfort of passengers.  RACHEL HERFIELD Montauk, L.I.</p>
