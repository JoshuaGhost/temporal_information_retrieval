        <p>Bret Saberhagen had it all working, the electric fastball, the lawless curve, the cruel changeup. A shame it was the fifth inning.</p>
        <p>Saberhagen, firing off the pitches that at last allowed him to look the rest of the Mets in the eyes, still had to stare inning after inning at the scoreboard that showed the Expos having scored five runs in the third.</p>
        <p>"You give up five runs," said Saberhagen, "and it's tough to win a ball game." So Far, No Victories</p>
        <p>And so the streak without a victory grows and the macabre humor grows less funny for Saberhagen, the right-hander for the Mets who was trumpeted as a certifiable superstar when he was acquired from the Royals in the off season. Saberhagen, the man with the pair of Cy Young Awards, hasn't won in his three starts for the Mets. Today, he gave up five runs in the third, spared the defeat only by a burst of offense that briefly deadlocked the score.</p>
        <p>"I should have three losses," he said bluntly.</p>
        <p>Saberhagen, who had given up 14 runs in his 2 previous starts, escaped trouble in the first and then crashed smack into disaster in the third. The opposing pitcher, Mark Gardner, singled to lead off, and then the Expos creamed Saberhagen with a blitz of two-out jolts. Ivan Calderon smoked a fastball for a run-scoring double; Larry Walker cranked a curve for a single and another run; Tim Wallach jettisoned an 0-2 fastball for a hit and another run, and then Marquis Grissom turned around a 1-0 changeup and planted it a dozen rows deep in the seats in left. Rhythm Comes Too Late</p>
        <p>After the third, Saberhagen appeared to find his rhythm. He retired 10 straight before he was pulled for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. Torborg, whose bullpen would help lose the game, defended his decision to lift a fully functional Saberhagen, saying the right-hander had reached a threshhold pitch total.</p>
        <p>"We decided not to push it," said Torborg.</p>
        <p>Saberhagen chose not to debate it afterward.</p>
        <p>"That's the National League," he said. And he added that the Saberhagen who pitched the last three innings was the pitcher he expected to be from here on out.</p>
