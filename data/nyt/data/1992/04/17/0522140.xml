        <p>Sunglasses concealed the 12 stitches over his right eye and the still-reddened pupil of his left eye. But in his gray suit and print tie, Alex Stewart looked mostly recovered from his brutal fight against George Foreman last Saturday.</p>
        <p>Stewart, who lost a majority decision in that Las Vegas bout, was in New York yesterday, reviewing a checkered career that was given a boost by his gutty performance against Foreman, even in defeat.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Stewart said that as he prepared for Foreman, he was obliged to examine his three earlier losses: to Evander Holyfield, Mike Tyson and Michael Moorer. Something Extra in the Ring</p>
        <p>"As I sat and looked at the tapes of those fights, I asked myself why I was getting hit and why I was doubting myself," Stewart said. "Because I did have doubts when I stepped across the line, to the elite heavyweights."</p>
        <p>What all that self-examination led to, he said, was a decision for the first time to rely on brains, not brawn, and to enter the fight with a game plan.</p>
        <p>"You see things more clearly when everything is on the line," Stewart said about his last chance for stardom. "All of a sudden, I had the option of becoming just an opponent, or fighting like I realistically can fight, of making hundreds of thousands of dollars a fight rather than $6,000."</p>
        <p>Stewart's plan was to make Foreman work for three minutes of every round, tiring him.</p>
        <p>"I told everybody I'd box him," said Stewart, who had won all 28 of his victories by knockout. "But they'd say, 'Does a leopard change his spots?' No, but I wanted to win. I have skills that I'd never used."</p>
        <p>Stewart's game plan got detoured in the second round of the 10-round bout. That was when Foreman floored him twice and seemed on the verge of scoring an early knockout. But Stewart surprised Foreman -- and boxing observers -- by rallying in what turned out to be a bloody and exciting brawl. The fight left the 43-year-old Foreman with lumps beneath both eyes and a distended right side of his face, and left Stewart, a part-time security guard in Clearwater, Fla., with a new boxing life.</p>
        <p>"We're thinking of going over the ocean," Bobby Goodman, Stewart's promoter, said in a reference to possible European bouts against British opponents.</p>
        <p>Goodman said that Stewart, who was born in England, could fight another comeback heavyweight, Frank Bruno, or a contender like Derek Williams.</p>
        <p>Foreman, who looked like a beaten man in victory, has even better prospects. He now awaits the outcome of Evander Holyfield's June 19 heavyweight title defense against Larry Holmes. Should Holmes win, Foreman would fight him in November in Las Vegas. Should Holyfield win, Foreman would probably take a stay-busy fight while deciding whether to wait for a rematch against Holyfield in early 1993 or to retire.</p>
        <p>Stewart's day in New York ended with a night at the fights: At the Paramount, heavyweight Michael Dokes knocked out Danny Sutton in three rounds, and world-class middleweight Lamar Parks scored a 10th-round knockout over Percy Harris. Toney Getting Mixed Reviews</p>
        <p>There is a feeling among some fight observers that James Toney, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, might just have what it takes to become a marquee giant. But lately, Toney's performances keep undermining that prophecy. In February, he had trouble making weight against Dave Tiberi, and it showed in the way he was sucking wind during the bout. Toney beat Tiberi but not impressively.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, in his successful title defense against Glen Wolfe in Las Vegas, Toney lacked that edge of anger that usually accompanies his performances. Toney says his his hands were hurt in the fourth round, forcing his circumspect approach.</p>
        <p>Despite these less-than-sensational showings, there is an aura about Toney. In his disputed draw against Mike McCallum in December, Toney showed defensive nuances and overall savvy that had not been as apparent against lesser foes. And even in the subpar fights against Tiberi and Wolfe, Toney showed signs of superior fighting skills.</p>
        <p>Toney's star has risen at a moment when the middle divisions are teeming with fighters who would measure just how deep the champion's resources are: Terry Norris, Julian Jackson, Iran Barkley, Simon Brown and Roy Jones Jr.</p>
        <p>If Toney and Jones, in particular, fulfill their promise, a matchup between them could turn into the sort of showdown the 1980's brought with fighters like Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Roberto Duran.</p>
