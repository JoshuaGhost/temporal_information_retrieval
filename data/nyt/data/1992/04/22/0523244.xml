        <p>The 35 principal United Way affiliates in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are as different from one another as urban Jersey City is from patrician Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>First there is the question of size, then of character.</p>
        <p>The United Way of New York City expects to raise $77 million this year with a staff of 127 people, paying its director $290,000 in salary, bonus and benefits. In contrast, the United Way of Sullivan County, N.Y., expects to raise $128,000 with a single staff member, who is paid $19,600 and receives no benefits.</p>
        <p>"When an article came out in the local paper recently about United Way and this office, donors were so concerned that they thought my salary should be raised," said Linda Cellini, executive director of Sullivan's United Way.</p>
        <p>Nobody says that to Ralph A. Dickerson Jr., the New York City executive. But Mr. Dickerson runs a bigger and more complex operation than any other United Way director in the region, with revenues of $93 million. Raising 38 percent of the money collected in the region, the United Way of New York City distributes it to some 300 private agencies, from the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, which received an $855,817 grant last year, to the Brooklyn Kindergarten Society, which received $2,500.</p>
        <p>The smallest United Ways simply collect and distribute money locally. Reflections of Communities</p>
        <p>Some United Ways are urban in character, some suburban, as might be expected. At the United Way of Hudson County, for example, volunteers from different immigrant groups are available daily to help new arrivals.</p>
        <p>The urban United Ways tend to face greater difficulties in raising money while helping social agencies with greater demands. They rely more heavily on the Tri-State partnership, which pools donations from 35 United Ways in the region, and redistributes them through a complicated formula. Wealthier suburban United Ways, such as the one in Bergen County, tend to give more to the pool than they get back. As a result, some chapters, Bergen among them, are considering withdrawing from the partnership; they are waiting for Tri-State to finish a revision of the distribution formula.</p>
        <p>Most United Ways spend from 50 to 60 percent of their budgets on payroll. The Tri-State office in New York City spends 64.4 percent of its $6.8 million operating budget on salaries, benefits and payroll taxes. The New York City affiliate office spends 61 percent of its $10.7 million operating budget on staff.</p>
