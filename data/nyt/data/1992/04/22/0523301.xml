        <p>Family Portrait  Ubu Repertory Theater 15 West 28th Street Through Sunday  By Denise Bonal; translated by Timothy Johns; directed by Shirley Kaplan; set design by John Brown; lighting, Greg MacPherson; costumes, Carol Ann Pelletier; production stage manager, David Waggett. WITH: Alice Alvarado, Paul Austin, Alison Bartlett, Robert Kerbeck, Joanna Merlin, Matthew Mutrie and Gareth Williams.</p>
        <p>The family in "Family Portrait," a French import by Denise Bonal, consists of a mother who works as a cleaning woman and aspires to the petite bourgeoisie, a pregnant daughter whose live-in boyfriend is a French version of a couch potato, and two sons: one a small-time thief and biker (except his bike has been stolen); the other a misfit whose ineptitude extends to five failed suicides. There is also a neighbor whose wife went to buy salt one day and never returned, the biker son's Arab girlfriend, and a dog that occasionally barks from offstage.</p>

        <p>Family Portrait  Ubu Repertory Theater 15 West 28th Street Through Sunday  By Denise Bonal; translated by Timothy Johns; directed by Shirley Kaplan; set design by John Brown; lighting, Greg MacPherson; costumes, Carol Ann Pelletier; production stage manager, David Waggett. WITH: Alice Alvarado, Paul Austin, Alison Bartlett, Robert Kerbeck, Joanna Merlin, Matthew Mutrie and Gareth Williams.</p>
        <p>The family in "Family Portrait," a French import by Denise Bonal, consists of a mother who works as a cleaning woman and aspires to the petite bourgeoisie, a pregnant daughter whose live-in boyfriend is a French version of a couch potato, and two sons: one a small-time thief and biker (except his bike has been stolen); the other a misfit whose ineptitude extends to five failed suicides. There is also a neighbor whose wife went to buy salt one day and never returned, the biker son's Arab girlfriend, and a dog that occasionally barks from offstage.</p>
        <p>The main problem with "Family Portrait" is that for all the absurdist pretentions Ms. Bonal tries to give her characters, they are, in the final analysis, a fairly conventional and hidebound lot -- a bit bizarre, perhaps, and stereotypically racist, but essentially harmless and dull. Another drawback is that despite some brief discussion of a harebrained scheme by the men to kidnap the corpse of a wealthy local (thinking the family will ransom it in order to give it a decent burial), not much happens. This family is long on talk, but little of it is to any point or, worse for a comedy, very funny. And a bitterly angry ending comes out of left field to dispel what faint humor has been built up in two hours of hard intermissionless work by a mostly fine cast.</p>
        <p>Paul Austin, who plays the downstairs neighbor, captures more than anyone the tempo and tone necessary to turn the yawns in "Family Portrait" into laughs. Alice Alvarado stands out as the sharp and shrewd young Arab girl who is taking a big risk marrying into this dubious family while her father is on a hajj. Alison Bartlett gives a fine performance as the daughter. Gareth Williams as her boyfriend, Robert Kerbeck as the suicidal son and Matthew Mutrie as the biker son all contribute credible readings.</p>
        <p>There is a crucial problem in the miscast Joanna Merlin as the mother. The veteran Ms. Merlin portrays the mother as a kindly if slightly ditsy woman holding onto some fanciful dreams about her family. As a result, the wrath the rest of the family directs against her is meaningless and she offers no foil for the others to play against. Timothy Johns's translation tends to be too literal (who could imagine the character of this mother using a word like "sinecure"?). Shirley Kaplan's direction moves things apace and somehow manages to keep the audience's interest from wavering too far afield.</p>
