        <p>A day after being discarded down the chute of a Bronx apartment house and discovered near death in a garbage bin, a newborn infant was given a good prognosis yesterday by doctors, who said he had improved significantly.</p>
        <p>The baby, named Jake by a resident at Jacobi Hospital, where he was taken Monday morning, lay comfortably yesterday afternoon, wearing a disposable diaper fastened with tapes decorated with Mickey Mouse figures, warmed by an overhead heating lamp and sucking a pacifier as doctors, nurses and well-wishers stopped by the neonatal intensive care unit to see how he was doing.</p>
        <p>One who did not visit was Jake's mother, whose identity detectives are still trying to learn. Sgt. Frank Viggiano, commander of the 49th Precinct Detective Squad, said investigators had spent most of Monday night knocking on the door of each of the 90 apartments in the six-story tan brick building at Cruger Avenue and Pelham Parkway South in the Pelham section, where the baby was found. They are still checking leads.</p>
        <p>The baby was about two hours old when the building porter found him in a garbage bin and alerted the superintendent, who quickly summoned a police officer. When the baby arrived at Jacobi by patrol car, he was not breathing and was so cold no temperature could be recorded, Dr. B. R. Suresh said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The baby did not suffer any serious injuries in the fall, said Dr. Marjorie Schulman, director of neonatology.</p>
