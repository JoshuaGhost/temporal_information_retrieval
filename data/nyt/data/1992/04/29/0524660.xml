        <p>The four former Soviet republics that have strategic nuclear weapons have reached an agreement that will expedite the ratification of the strategic arms reduction treaty with the United States, Ukraine's President said today.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan are to act as equal partners in the signing of a new protocol with the United States reconfirming the treaty, known as Start.</p>
        <p>Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the treaty was put on hold due to a confusion over which member of the Commonwealth of Independent States would take the responsibility of ratifying the treaty. The agreement forming the Commonwealth of Independent States committed all members to honor the Soviet Union's international treaties, but the Russian Government had said that only Russia and the United States should ratify the arms-reduction pact, which was signed last year by President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>The Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, said at a news conference today that "Russia has no objections" to the new arrangement. The foreign ministers of the four republics will meet soon with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to sign the protocol, Mr. Kravchuk said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk said Ukraine remains committed to ridding itself of all nuclear weapons, not just the 130 strategic missiles now on its territory. Mr. Kravchuk said that 46 tactical nuclear missiles remain on Ukrainian soil, and that they are being transferred to Russia for demolition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk stressed that when Ukraine achieves its goal of becoming a non-nuclear state it will be vulnerable in its national security. "We will need some guarantees from the world community," he said. "This problem is especially acute in situations when our neighbors such as Russia present territorial claims."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk is scheduled to visit the United States next week, and is to meet with President Bush on May 6. He said there is a noticeable change in the American approach toward Ukraine.  U.S. View of Ukraine</p>
        <p>"Previously Ukraine was viewed through a prism of U.S. policy toward Russia," Mr. Kravchuk said. He said the United States now views Ukraine as a young and democratic country and is working out the necessary political guidelines for its future development.</p>
        <p>In a separate press conference, charge d'affaires at the United States Embassy in Kiev, John Gunderson, said that one of the issues to be discussed in the meeting between President Bush and Mr. Kravchuk would be the granting of most-favored-nation trading status to Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Regarding concrete programs for aid, Mr. Gunderson said President Bush and the United States Congress have agreed to immediately provide Ukraine with approximately $50 million in financial assistance. An additional $90 million is expected to be granted in 1993, he said.</p>
        <p>The American aid program is aimed at supporting the development of a free market system, democratization, providing the most necessary humanitarian aid, realizing the process of converting military plants into civilian use and promoting investments and bilateral trade.</p>
