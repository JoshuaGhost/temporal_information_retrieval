        <p>"I feel as if I've given birth to twins," RICHARD KAPLAN, the executive producer of "Prime Time Live," said jubilantly to DIANE SAWYER, an anchor of the program. The two stood sipping drinks Tuesday evening on the terrace of Hickory Hill, ETHEL KENNEDY'S rambling house in McLean, Va. Mr. Kaplan had good reason to feel proud, since the program had just won two honors at the 24th annual Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards ceremony.</p>
        <p>A crush of politicians, journalists and assorted Kennedys had turned up to mingle, and to congratulate the winners of the prizes, sometimes called the "poor man's Pulitzers." The winners included Jacquee Petchel and Andres Viglucci of The Miami Herald, Paul Conrad of The Los Angeles Times, Suzanne Kreiter of The Boston Globe, Minnesota Public Radio and The North Idaho College Sentinel.</p>

        <p>"I feel as if I've given birth to twins," RICHARD KAPLAN, the executive producer of "Prime Time Live," said jubilantly to DIANE SAWYER, an anchor of the program. The two stood sipping drinks Tuesday evening on the terrace of Hickory Hill, ETHEL KENNEDY'S rambling house in McLean, Va. Mr. Kaplan had good reason to feel proud, since the program had just won two honors at the 24th annual Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards ceremony.</p>
        <p>A crush of politicians, journalists and assorted Kennedys had turned up to mingle, and to congratulate the winners of the prizes, sometimes called the "poor man's Pulitzers." The winners included Jacquee Petchel and Andres Viglucci of The Miami Herald, Paul Conrad of The Los Angeles Times, Suzanne Kreiter of The Boston Globe, Minnesota Public Radio and The North Idaho College Sentinel.</p>
        <p>Representative JOSEPH P. KENNEDY 2d greeted the 200 guests, along with his mother and sisters KATHLEEN KENNEDY TOWNSEND, KERRY KENNEDY CUOMO and RORY KENNEDY. He explained that the awards go to print, television and radio reports, photographs and cartoons that call attention to injustice and the plight of the disenfranchised. They were established by a group of journalists who traveled with Robert Kennedy on his last campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sawyer said it was not her first visit to Hickory Hill: "I was here for dinner once, and I remember a lot of singing. Ethel always gets people singing and somehow Lenny Bernstein and I ended up doing a duet."</p>
