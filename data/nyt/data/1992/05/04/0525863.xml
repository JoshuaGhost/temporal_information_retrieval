        <p>Family demons and the visceral realities of urban street life converge in Elizabeth Swados's venturesome new musical play, "Groundhog." Depending on one's point of view, the title character is either "a paranoiac schizophrenic" or "a primitive wild genius." For Ms. Swados, who knows him like a brother, he is both at the same time.</p>
        <p>In this deeply personalized work (at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II), Groundhog is partly based on Ms. Swados's own sibling, who died after years of living as a street person. For fictional purposes, he is combined with a character like Joyce Brown (also known as Billie Boggs), who became a subject of controversy in New York in the late 1980's. Acting as playwright, composer and director, Ms. Swados is unflinching in her response to the madness of Groundhog (David Schechter), a figure to haunt anyone's nightmare. Watching the musical, one wonders how the author and her fictional surrogate (Anne Bobby) were able to endure the abuse.</p>

        <p>Family demons and the visceral realities of urban street life converge in Elizabeth Swados's venturesome new musical play, "Groundhog." Depending on one's point of view, the title character is either "a paranoiac schizophrenic" or "a primitive wild genius." For Ms. Swados, who knows him like a brother, he is both at the same time.</p>
        <p>In this deeply personalized work (at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II), Groundhog is partly based on Ms. Swados's own sibling, who died after years of living as a street person. For fictional purposes, he is combined with a character like Joyce Brown (also known as Billie Boggs), who became a subject of controversy in New York in the late 1980's. Acting as playwright, composer and director, Ms. Swados is unflinching in her response to the madness of Groundhog (David Schechter), a figure to haunt anyone's nightmare. Watching the musical, one wonders how the author and her fictional surrogate (Anne Bobby) were able to endure the abuse.</p>
        <p>The narrative deals with a court hearing to determine if Groundhog is sane enough to be released from confinement in Bellevue and return to his life as a street musician. As with Billie Boggs, he quickly becomes a political issue as the American Civil Liberties Union fights the District Attorney's office, and as the Mayor and the media compete for public attention. Naturally, all warring parties ignore Groundhog's best interests.</p>
        <p>This ambitious attempt at writing a musical play of Brechtian proportions is not entirely successful. Searching for a resolution in the second act, Ms. Swados momentarily overlooks her musical needs and becomes tendentious. There are also steps along the way that should be abbreviated. But none of this substantially detracts from the seriousness and the immediacy of the effort.</p>
        <p>In this show, as in her recently published family memoir, "The Four of Us" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), Ms. Swados comes to terms with traumatizing events. Considering the pitfalls, the approach is remarkably free of self-pity and sentimentality. The role of Groundhog could have been conceived as a clownish eccentric. Instead, as written by Ms. Swados and as portrayed by Mr. Schechter, he has the hardest of edges, and around him is an aura of incipient malice. Mr. Schechter's tightly coiled performance would seem to be an authentic depiction of the extreme irrationality of the character in life.</p>
        <p>The sister's role is that of anxious pawn. She keeps trying to do what she thinks is the right thing and is repeatedly blocked by her brother's delusionary behavior. Ms. Bobby tellingly conveys her character's mixed allegiances as, trying to embrace her brother, she is swept aside as if she is a fly that has landed on his face.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swados widens her dramatic focus to explore the failings of social programs and of the court system. Especially in the courtroom, she reveals her flair for satirizing authority figures: the judge who hopes the case will become his movie of the week; the expert witnesses who have to consult their notes before contradicting one another. Groundhog stage-manages the trial while also playing the leading role. Interrupting the summations of the bitterly competitive lawyers, he places his hands over their heads and announces, "It's 'College Bowl'!"</p>
        <p>In characteristic fashion, the composer has created a highly eclectic score, with salsafied Swados alternating with rap and rock, with dialogue fading into recitative. The music is not as melodic as it was in "Runaways" and other Swados musicals, but it has a definite New York beat. Many of the strongest numbers are sung by Mr. Schechter and Ms. Bobby, separately and as duets.</p>
        <p>With several exceptions, notably Nora Cole as Groundhog's lawyer and Daniel Neiden as a mayor with the vocal inflections of Edward I. Koch, the supporting cast lacks individuality. In part, that is due to the fact that the actors double in so many roles, moving from functioning citizens to homeless people huddling in blankets. In this austere production, the set designer, G. W. Mercier, has trimmed his own imagination, using interchangeable chairs and tables for courtroom, street and shelter.</p>
        <p>Dominating the show is the figure of Groundhog, dancing on the edge of lunacy while mocking a closed society that is unable to deal with him and the other dispossessed. Unlike so many musicals, "Groundhog" has something relevant to say and speaks with a veracity that arises from experience.
