        <p>A right-wing Member of Parliament said in a newspaper interview today that he had confessed to helping bomb a formerly white high school in his constituency that was to serve children of black political exiles returning from abroad.</p>

        <p>A right-wing Member of Parliament said in a newspaper interview today that he had confessed to helping bomb a formerly white high school in his constituency that was to serve children of black political exiles returning from abroad.</p>
        <p>Rapport, a Sunday paper, quoted the legislator, Koos Botha, as admitting his involvement in the bombing of the Hillview High School, in Pretoria's northern suburbs, last June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha said he was motivated by what he described as a culture of violence and despair within the white Conservative Party as a result of the dismantling of apartheid undertaken by President F. W. de Klerk.</p>
        <p>The legislator was arrested by police on Wednesday in connection with the explosion, which left the school too damaged to accommodate the children of returning members of the African National Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha was quoted by Rapport as saying that he had cooperated with the police since his arrest and had made a full confession. He said he had staked out the school to make sure that no one would be hurt by the explosives, which he said were provided by a friend in the mining industry.</p>
        <p>Four whites belonging to the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi paramilitary group committed to white supremacy, have also been arrested in connection with the bombing. All five are to stand trial next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha's arrest came as a surprise because the legislator was considered a relative moderate. The Conservative Party expelled him last month for proposing that it join the multiracial negotiations under way on South Africa's future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha said Afrikaners should use the talks to advance their case for a separate white homeland. The negotiations are aimed at a new constitution that would give blacks political rights.</p>
        <p>Last week the party expelled another Member of Parliament, Koos van der Merwe, for wanting to join the talks. Mr. van der Merwe, who has not been linked to the bombing, was the party's senior spokesman until last year.</p>
        <p>A split has been predicted in the party since a referendum on March 17 in which over two-thirds of the voters (only whites could vote) gave President de Klerk a mandate to negotiate power-sharing with blacks.</p>
