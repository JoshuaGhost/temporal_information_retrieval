        <p>Adam Fuss  Robert Miller Gallery 41 East 57th Street Manhattan Through June 13</p>
        <p>Walking into this small show of Adam Fuss's new photograms (a kind of print made without a lens) is a bit like entering a Baroque chapel, with dark putti zooming around in golden clouds of light. In the past, Mr. Fuss has made color photograms by placing sheets of photographic paper into trays of water and flashing them with colored light, recording the concentric ripples caused by dripping liquid, or the waves made by swimming snakes. Here he puts babies in the trays, capturing their silhouettes as they lie, crawl or sit in the shallow water.</p>
        <p>The results recall similar silhouettes, both photographic and painted, made in recent decades by a range of artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Bruce Conner and Yves Klein. But Mr. Fuss's examples, all but one of which are in glowing tones of yellow, brown and orange, combine a sentimental charm with an almost laughable sense of the grandiose. Transposed to the wall, the babies appear to be flying or floating, curled in on themselves or with arms and legs outstretched.</p>

        <p>Despite their delightful wackiness, the pictures suffer from their similarity. Mr. Fuss has hit on a good idea and obviously wants to work it for all it's worth. Once the initial impact wears off, though, the show starts to seem a bit thin.</p>
