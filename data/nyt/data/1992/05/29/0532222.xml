        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The AIDS 'Plot' Against Blacks" (editorial, May 12) seems to dismiss the idea that human immunodeficiency virus was engineered out of hand. I believe that this is a mistake, as there are solid grounds on which to base this belief.</p>
        <p>When I first heard the theory that H.I.V. had been engineered by the U.S. Government, I thought it ludicrous. Later, I learned about the Tuskegee study, in which syphilitic black men were studied by the Government over their lifetimes to gain information about the effects of syphilis. These men were never treated for the disease, even after penicillin became available, nor were they even told that their conditions were treatable.</p>
        <p>Although I regard the idea that H.I.V. was engineered as implausible and unlikely, I no longer consider it to be ludicrous and impossible. I read about the Tuskegee study in a book. Blacks deal with this kind of callous indifference and outright hostility on a regular basis. It does not surprise me that many of them honestly believe that H.I.V. is a man-made virus created for the purpose of genocide.</p>

        <p>If this belief is to be adequately addressed, media like The New York Times must not regard it as an irrational fear or paranoid fantasy. Instead, the media need to educate the public on how difficult it would be to create such a virus, and why it would be in the Government's best interest not to do such a thing. The belief cannot be countered unless it is taken seriously. JOHN C. STEVENS Columbus, Ohio, May 15, 1992</p>
