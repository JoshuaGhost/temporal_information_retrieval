        <p>In a peculiar footnote to the 1988 Presidential campaign, a Federal prisoner tried to step forward four days before the election to assert that he had once sold marijuana to Dan Quayle. His accusation was never substantiated and he returned to the obscurity of his cell.</p>
        <p>But now evidence collected in connection with a lawsuit by the inmate, Brett C. Kimberlin, indicates that the Bush-Quayle campaign was involved in a decision by the highest official of the Bureau of Prisons to silence Mr. Kimberlin and place him in solitary confinement.</p>
        <p>No evidence has surfaced to indicate that Mr. Quayle personally intervened in the case, though in recent days his press secretary, David C. Beckwith, has called several radio talk shows to challenge Mr. Kimberlin's assertions.</p>
        <p>But Government documents and testimony from officials of the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons and the campaign show that the director of the Bureau of Prisons in Washington personally ordered Mr. Kimberlin into solitary confinement four days before the election and canceled a news conference that had been planned by authorities at the Federal Correctional Institution in El Reno, Okla., where Mr. Kimberlin was incarcerated, after a campaign official complained about it to the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Evidence compiled in recent weeks and months supports many of the accusations in the lawsuit, parts of which have been reported in The Legal Times, a weekly trade publication for lawyers. It shows that campaign officials were more nervous than they let on publicly about 11th-hour accusations that Mr. Quayle used drugs. Issue Not Drugs But Free Speech</p>
        <p>"We're not concerned with the drug allegations," said Howard Rosenblatt, Mr. Kimberlin's lawyer with the firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, which has taken his case without a fee as a public service. "This is a First Amendment case, and the evidence has been adding to the conclusion that Federal officials punished Mr. Kimberlin and locked him up to keep people from hearing what he had to say."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberlin filed the lawsuit here in 1990, asserting that canceling his news conference and putting him in solitary confinement until after the election violated his First Amendment rights. Courts have held, and prison regulations generally require, that prisoners be permitted to meet with reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberlin was confined to a four-by-six-foot cell late on the Friday evening before the election. Except for a brief respite, he remained there until six days after the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberlin, 37 years old, was convicted of drug smuggling and explosives charges and began a 51-year prison sentence in 1979. His conviction came after a series of bombings in Speedway, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis. He was eligible for release in 1989 after serving 10 years; the Parole Commission has scheduled his release for February 1994.</p>
        <p>Prison officials in Washington maintain that the actions of the bureau director, J. Michael Quinlan, were not motivated by political interests. But they also acknowledge that Mr. Kimberlin is the only inmate known to have been placed in solitary confinement on orders from a bureau director.</p>
        <p>In a Justice Department memorandum that has become part of the court record, Mr. Quinlan said that he isolated Mr. Kimberlin that Friday at the urging of the Justice Department's director of public affairs, Loye W. Miller Jr., who asserted that Mr. Kimberlin's life was in danger. Aide to Atwater Acted as Liaison</p>
        <p>But the prison never verified any threat to Mr. Kimberlin and ultimately found he was not in danger. Earlier in the day, Mr. Miller and his aide had received complaints about the news conference from Mark Goodin, a top aide to Lee Atwater, the chairman of the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodin, the Bush-Quayle campaign's deputy press secretary, acted as a liaison between the campaign and the Justice Department and had briefed many of the senior campaign officials about Mr. Kimberlin. In a deposition, he said that he had told Mr. Miller that he was "amazed" and "bowled over" by the prospect of the news conference.</p>
        <p>"I expressed a fair amount of surprise and shock that a Federal prisoner could hold a press conference while incarcerated," he said.</p>
        <p>Stuart K. Spencer, the Vice President's campaign manager, said in a recent deposition that he had briefed Mr. Quayle about the planned news conference. And James Lake, another campaign official who remains a key adviser, said in sworn testimony that Mr. Kimberlin's accusations were taken seriously, noting, "It is always serious when drug use is charged in a campaign."</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodin, Mr. Quinlan and Mr. Miller have denied the accusations in the lawsuit by Mr. Kimberlin that they conspired to deny him his First Amendment rights. R. Joseph Sher, a Justice Department lawyer who is representing the Government, as well as Mr. Quinlan and Mr. Miller, said that there was no pressure on the Bureau of Prisons by the campaign. And they said there was nothing improper or unusual about the discussions between the Justice Department and the campaign.</p>
        <p>"There is nothing in the record that shows that anybody in the campaign made an improper request," Mr. Sher said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodin, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, resigned from the Republican National Committee in 1989 after acknowledging that he was the author of a memorandum saying that House Speaker Thomas S. Foley should come "out of the liberal closet" and that linked his voting record to that of Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a staunch liberal who is a homosexual.</p>
        <p>Last year a Federal judge found sufficient evidence to deny the Government's motion to dismiss Mr. Kimberlin's lawsuit. The ruling was significant because Mr. Kimberlin's lawyers had to overcome a higher standard of proof that protects officials, who have a qualified immunity against lawsuits.</p>
        <p>An appeals court will review the dismissal decision in October. Mr. Kimberlin has received support on the appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington. Early Release Date 'Suddenly Dried Up'</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberlin's friends and lawyers say the accusations about selling marijuana to Mr. Quayle have hindered his efforts for an early release from his 51-year prison sentence.</p>
        <p>"It looks like there has been a strong internal reaction against him," said Erwin N. Griswold, the 87-year-old former dean of Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations. "Where he was making progress towards an early release date, that suddenly has dried up and apparently from suggestions in high places."</p>
        <p>Mr. Griswold, who has known Mr. Kimberlin for more than five years, represented him in an unsuccessful appeal of his conviction. "He is a credible person, and I have found him able and reliable," Mr. Griswold said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quinlan, a career prison official who rose to become director of the Bureau of Prisons a few months before the election, declined repeated requests for an interview. Mr. Sher of the Justice Department said that Mr. Kimberlin's parole had not been affected by the case or by his accusations about Mr. Quayle. Prison Planned News Conference</p>
        <p>Senior Republican officials began to be nervous about the effect of Mr. Kimberlin's accusations in October 1988, when a friend of the prisoner told a reporter that Mr. Kimberlin had sold marijuana to Mr. Quayle and Mr. Kimberlin then began receiving calls from news organizations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimberlin was interviewed by reporters from National Public Radio and NBC news, neither of which ran the story because they never verified it. But after the local El Reno newspaper reported that an NBC crew was at the prison, the story was picked up by a national wire service and prison officials were inundated with interview requests. They decided the best way to handle the flood was to hold a news conference.</p>
        <p>"I felt it was the easiest way for the institution to resolve the situation was to have everybody come in, talk to this guy, get it over with," Gregory Hershberger, who was acting warden at the time, told Mr. Kimberlin's lawyers.</p>
        <p>Senior Justice Department officials say they also advised the Bureau of Prisons about how to handle requests from reporters for interviews with Mr. Kimberlin. Francis A. Keating 2d, who was an Associate Attorney General and the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, recalls that he talked with Mr. Quinlan in the final weeks of the campaign.</p>
        <p>"I said whatever our policy is, to follow it," Mr. Keating said in an interview last week. "I said to handle it routinely. However they do it in El Reno, that's the way it should be handled. I said there should be no new policy set just before the election."</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodin testified that he called the public affairs office at the Justice Department after the news conference was scheduled. He said he was told by an assistant to Mr. Miller at the Justice Department that the news conference was proper "unless there was an immediate security concern."</p>
        <p>In a memorandum written 10 months after the incident, Mr. Miller conveys a much more negative tone about the proposed news conference.</p>
        <p>"I did think it was rather extraordinary that a convicted felon in a Federal penitentiary could manage to be allowed to hold a press conference -- about anything," said Mr. Miller, the former department spokesman. "Given that this press conference, if it came off, could create a possibly sensational national story as a result of a bureaucratic decision within our department, I thought that a senior department official at least ought to be aware of what was going on and the department's role in it." Justice Officials Informed Campaign</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said that after informing senior Justice Department officials about the news conference, he learned that it had been canceled by Mr. Quinlan.  The Justice Department then promptly notified the campaign of the cancellation, according to the court record.</p>
        <p>Late that Friday evening, Mr. Quinlan ordered Mr. Kimberlin to be confined. In a memorandum he wrote later to Mr. Keating, Mr. Quinlan said he acted after receiving word that Mr. Miller feared Mr. Kimberlin "might be in some danger." Mr. Quinlan said Mr. Miller had reported that he heard from Nina Totenberg, a reporter at National Public Radio, that Mr. Kimberlin had been threatened.</p>
        <p>But in sworn affidavits Ms. Totenberg denies saying Mr. Kimberlin's life was in danger, and Mr. Kimberlin does not recall making such an assertion. A subsequent investigation by local prison officials found that his safety was never threatened.</p>
        <p>One senior prison official, Thomas R. Kane, who is Mr. Quinlan's chief of staff, suggested in his deposition that Mr. Kimberlin was secluded because of a fear that some Quayle supporters in the prison might want to get even.</p>
        <p>Prison authorities removed Mr. Kimberlin from the solitary cell on Saturday evening after Ms. Totenberg threatened to report the incident on National Public Radio. But he was returned to solitary on Monday morning, Nov. 7, moments before he was to have held a news conference by telephone with reporters who had rented a hotel room at the Mayflower in Washington.</p>
        <p>This time, Mr. Kimberlin was accused of violating prison rules by "attempting to misuse the telephone and avoid the enforcement of our policy on access to the media."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sher of the Justice Department gave a different explanation. He said that Mr. Kimberlin was put in solitary for a week because he violated the rules by trying to get a friend to forward his telephone call to the Dukakis campaign.</p>
