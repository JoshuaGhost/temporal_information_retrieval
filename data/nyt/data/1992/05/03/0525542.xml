        <p>SOME people just love their lawns. They fertilize them. They cut them. They water them. They hover over them. They nuke them with pesticides and herbicides. I knew a man who wouldn't even let his wife walk on the lawn.</p>
        <p>"Some folks think of lawns as animate objects, a living thing like a dog or a cat, and they feel pain if their lawn doesn't feel good," said Eliot C. Roberts, director of the Lawn Institute in Pleasant Hill, Tenn. "They want to do something. And it's hard for us to say, 'Leave the lawn alone for a while; it'll probably take care of itself.' "</p>
        <p>High maintenance grasses, like the old Kentucky bluegrass cultivars, slurp up fertilizer and water and are susceptible to insects and diseases. You might call them the co-dependents of the lawn addict's misdirected love.</p>
        <p>"Some grasses have been advertised as requiring a lot of care because people like being involved," said Dr. Roberts, who has a Ph.D. in soil science from Rutgers University. "It's the idea of a hobby: if you put something into it, you'll get more out. Input is correlated with results, with tender loving care."</p>
        <p>But these days, as pesticides and nitrates show up in ground water, and herbicides like 2,4-D are linked to higher rates of cancer, people are going out on that soft green turf with a different attitude. They still love their lawns, but they want to grow them without polluting their water table or harming their children or dogs. And chances are, their grass will be healthier, too.</p>
        <p>The first thing grass needs is what every plant needs -- good soil.</p>
        <p>"And you don't enrich the soil with chemical fertilizers," Dr. Roberts said. "They leach out and get into the ground water. Or they become fixed -- bound up with other chemicals -- and are not available to the plant."</p>
        <p>Phosphorus is a prime example. It ties up with calcium to produce calcium phosphate or with iron to make iron phosphate, both of which are insoluble and useless to the plant.</p>
        <p>Soil should also have a pH (the scale that measures alkalinity or acidity) of 6.5 to 7, which is slightly acid (7 is neutral). "Much more than that favors fungi, which is likely to cause disease," Dr. Robert said.</p>
        <p>Next, use a natural organic fertilizer (synthetic organic fertilizers leach more quickly). It's more expensive, but in the long run, it pays off.</p>
        <p>A natural organic like manure has plenty of microorganisms, which are the soldiers of soil-making. By digesting dead plant material and dead roots, they produce humus, which is teeming with nutrients and air and microbes.</p>
        <p>"In 1,000 square feet of lawn, down to a six-inch depth, which is where most of the roots are, there are 45 quadrillion microorganisms, and they're all making humus and aerating the soil under our feet," Dr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>Composted sewage sludge, like Milorganite, from Milwaukee, and Sustane, a composted turkey manure from Chaska, Minn., are two of Dr. Roberts's favorites. He also recommends Ringer's Lawn Restore.</p>
        <p>"The important thing is to choose a natural organic, for the maximum of biological activity," he said. "Man just can't duplicate nature. Synthetics are an attempt, but they never measure up."</p>
        <p>A healthy lawn usually requires only one fertilization, in the fall. But grass being weaned from chemicals and pesticides may require a spring fertilization, until soil and plants come into balance.</p>
        <p>Too much fertilizer, especially a soluble synthetic, forces too-rapid growth, taking nutrients and sugars stored in the roots for leaf production. You get a top-heavy plant, with a shallow root system. Then the lawn fanatic gets out there with the mower, and hacks off half the plant -- removing half its ability to photosynthesize and produce food that could start going back down into the depleted roots.</p>
        <p>See how TLC is really a form of lawn torture?</p>
        <p>"The whole process makes the plant more susceptible to disease and insects and that's when weeds encroach and then pesticides are used," Dr. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>Overfertilizing, as well as overwatering, can also cause too much thatch, the layer of grass clippings, roots and stolons that sits on the surface of the soil. If the grass grows too fast, microorganisms can't keep up with their job of decomposing; if the soil is soggy, they don't have enough oxygen to do their work. So rent a dethatching machine and go over the lawn five or six times. Aerating the soil with a core cultivator or aerating machine can also help.</p>
        <p>Just mowing and watering correctly can energize a foundering lawn.</p>
        <p>Mow high, about two and a half to three inches, and never remove more than one-third of the grass blades.</p>
        <p>"If you raise the mower just one-eighth of an inch on a 1,000-square-foot lawn, you will have the equivalent of 300 square feet of new leaf surface -- which is intercepting light and photosynthesizing to feed all those plants."</p>
        <p>The lawn, remember, is just a vast collection of individual grass plants. A 1,000-square-foot lawn has 800,000 of them, about six plants per square inch. And if they are healthy, they will shade out weeds, eliminating the need for herbicides.</p>
        <p>Don't bag those clippings: "Returning all your clippings to the lawn could be the equivalent of three applications of fertilizer a year," Dr. Roberts said. "It not only keeps the sanitary landfills from getting clogged up, but why should we waste such a valuable organic resource?" Spread the clippings out with a bamboo rake.</p>
        <p>Stop overwatering: It only takes an inch of water a week to grow most grasses, and much of that water comes from the soil or rain, so just make up the difference.</p>
        <p>"Most people give a lawn two or three times what it needs, which weakens the grass," he said. "It squeezes air out of the root zone, and organisms don't have enough oxygen to decompose, and it also leaches the nutrients past the root zone."</p>
        <p>An excellent guide to healthy grass is "The Chemical-Free Lawn," by Warren Schultz (Rodale, $14.95).</p>
