        <p>The "buckyball," a type of carbon molecule shaped like a soccer ball, may prove to be a highly efficient filter for separating gases, according to scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.</p>
        <p>Buckyballs, which were discovered in the mid-1980's, are hollow molecules of 60 or 70 carbon atoms that resemble the geodesic domes designed by R. Buckminster Fuller, the late architect and inventor. Technically, the molecules are called buckminsterfullerenes.</p>
        <p>Because of the way the atoms are linked, there are regular spaces between the crystalline buckyball molecules. Buckyballs contain 60 carbon atoms, and the Sandia researchers have found that molecules of gases like hydrogen and oxygen fit easily in the spaces between the molecules. In fact, experiments indicate it is difficult to fabricate buckyballs without gas molecules automatically filling in about 1 percent of these gaps, or interstitial spaces.</p>
        <p>Under pressure, as many as half of the interstitial spaces are filled by oxygen molecules, which ooze out slowly when the pressure is removed. "If you put in a lot of oxygen, even after 25 days, approximately half the oxygen is left," said Roger A. Assink, a staff scientist at Sandia. Thus, the materials may have application as a medium for gas storage.</p>
        <p>A more promising use may be gas separation. Because the buckyballs are crystalline, Mr. Assink said, the shape and distribution of the spaces between the crystals are more precise than those in the conventional membranes used to separate gases.</p>
        <p>The interstitial spaces are also the right size to trap relatively small molecules like hydrogen or oxygen. But larger molecules, like methane, cannot fit. Since the usable part of natural gas is largely methane, buckyball filters could be useful in separating out unwanted oxygen and nitrogen found with natural gas. The result would be a purer fuel.</p>
        <p>So far, the gas tests have been conducted on buckyballs in powdered form. Mechanically weak in structure, buckyballs would have to be overlaid on some sort of breathable supporting material to give a filtration device the necessary bulk and shape.</p>
        <p>"We have to find a way to form a thin film of buckyballs on a porous support, and we have some ideas on that," Mr. Assink said.  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
