        <p>Iso Dance is a creature of wild extremes, to judge by the program the company presented on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street), where it performs through tomorrow. Iso at its best was represented by "Slow Fade to Roger," a new work choreographed by Jamey Hampton and Ashley Roland and danced to music by John Paul Jones and the Lounge Lizards. "Woomen," a 1983 duet choreographed and performed by Mr. Hampton and Daniel Ezralow, was Iso at its most puerile.</p>
        <p>It was hard to tell what its creators had in mind in the premiere. Was Roger the man dressed like a surgeon? Were the two men and two women churning about him the asylum inmates they resembled? None of it made much sense, and perhaps it was not intended to, but senselessness tends to get boring after a while. Then just as one had settled down for a spate of generic flux, an intriguing little dance surfaced that had Ms. Roland flapping like a woebegone rag doll, parts of her body seeming eerily disconnected from the rest. Around her, sometimes led by her, was a chorus of bodies inching their way along the floor like worms. It was an apocalyptic vision fully realized in movement but all too short, for soon it was back to episodic prat-falling.</p>

        <p>Iso Dance is a creature of wild extremes, to judge by the program the company presented on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street), where it performs through tomorrow. Iso at its best was represented by "Slow Fade to Roger," a new work choreographed by Jamey Hampton and Ashley Roland and danced to music by John Paul Jones and the Lounge Lizards. "Woomen," a 1983 duet choreographed and performed by Mr. Hampton and Daniel Ezralow, was Iso at its most puerile.</p>
        <p>It was hard to tell what its creators had in mind in the premiere. Was Roger the man dressed like a surgeon? Were the two men and two women churning about him the asylum inmates they resembled? None of it made much sense, and perhaps it was not intended to, but senselessness tends to get boring after a while. Then just as one had settled down for a spate of generic flux, an intriguing little dance surfaced that had Ms. Roland flapping like a woebegone rag doll, parts of her body seeming eerily disconnected from the rest. Around her, sometimes led by her, was a chorus of bodies inching their way along the floor like worms. It was an apocalyptic vision fully realized in movement but all too short, for soon it was back to episodic prat-falling.</p>
        <p>"Slow Fade to Roger," which had lighting by Mr. Hampton, Ms. Roland and Robert Kalfin and costumes by Ms. Roland and Roland Roux, was performed by Mr. Hampton, Ms. Roland, Morleigh Steinberg, Jack Gallagher and Brian Frette. All danced, together with Mr. Ezralow, in the final curtain calls, which were the evening's second high point. Spinning and leaping into and out of a central spot of light, each company member got a chance to let loose and just dance, and it was exciting.</p>
        <p>As for "Woomen," it epitomized the kinds of tricks that Iso seems to think imaginative -- belching, nose-blowing into the stage curtain, conversations in gibberish and other adolescent fooling around -- though there were some inspired, funny bits of mime strewn through the sprawling suite of shticks. "Madame Morphose," a new solo choreographed and performed by Ms. Roland to music by Ludivico Einaudi, was a dance for the upper half of a woman whose arms snaked softly into the dark. The lighting had a good deal to do with the solo's minimal effect, as lighting frequently did on the program, but the piece was so limp it seemed as if there had been some technological miscues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ezralow has pulled his "Trazom" (read it backward) into much more cohesive shape since its premiere last summer at Lincoln Center Out-of-Doors. There is a gleaming, streamlined jokiness now to the quartet, danced by two epicene males and two girls-next-door to music by Mozart, Michel Colombier and Marc Tchanz. And the shiny plastic costumes by Anita Evenpoel and Michele Lamy have a bright charm. But this is still a piece for dancegoers who think the conventions of opera and ballet are automatically funny. "Trazom" was performed with just the right high spirits and comic energy by Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Frette, Ms. Roland and Ms. Steinberg.</p>
        <p>The program ended with "Night Thoughts," a dance choreographed by its performers to music by the Bulgarian National Women's Radio and Television Choir. At first the dance looks gimmicky as two women in white filmy dresses descend, hanging upside down on wires, on two desolate looking men. One thinks of Pilobolus, from which Iso is descended, and how that company didn't need wires for its effects. So much of the impact of dance lies in its suggestive power. But once the men are fitted into harnesses, the visual effect is poetic and even awesome. The four, floating and dipping through space, could well be angels.</p>
