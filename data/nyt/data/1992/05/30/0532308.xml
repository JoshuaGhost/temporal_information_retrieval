        <p>Thoughts of a world-renowned conductor and composer on the eve of his only daughter's wedding: "I don't worry at all when I'm conducting an orchestra, but I certainly do when I'm going to give my daughter away."</p>
        <p>LUKAS FOSS was contemplating the prospect of escorting ELIZA FOSS, an actress, down the aisle in Manhattan this afternoon, when she marries PHILLIP TURINO, an architect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foss will escort his daughter to a march from "The Marriage of Figaro," which he arranged for the occasion. Then as soon as he completes the walk, he will slip into the role of pianist for a wedding aria called "Come, My Beloved," from his cantata "Song of Songs." It is to be sung by CAROLANN PAGE, soprano.</p>
        <p>Other musicians who will participate, both individually and collectively, are CAROL WINCENC, flute; HUMBERT LUCARELLI, oboe, and SUSAN JOLLES, harp. "The musicians are all friends, and Mozart is my friend, too," Mr. Foss said. "He has been my friend since I was 7 years old."</p>
        <p>For the reception, he is to turn the reins over to another friend, LARRY RIVERS, the artist and jazz saxophonist, whose band will play for dancing.</p>
        <p>"Being the father of the bride is an incredibly romantic situation," Mr. Foss said. "Maybe I had that in mind when I wrote the 'Song of Songs.' "</p>
