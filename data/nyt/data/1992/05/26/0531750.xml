        <p>As a time to remember Americans fallen in battle, Memorial Day was fittingly gray and somber in the New York region yesterday. Temperatures seldom reached 60 degrees, and the sun played peek-a-boo in overcast skies.</p>

        <p>As a time to remember Americans fallen in battle, Memorial Day was fittingly gray and somber in the New York region yesterday. Temperatures seldom reached 60 degrees, and the sun played peek-a-boo in overcast skies.</p>
        <p>But as a day off from work, as a day to celebrate the traditional, if unofficial, first day of summer, the holiday offered as chilly a reception as did the area's parks and beaches.</p>
        <p>"It certainly wasn't a beach day," said Anthony Gigi, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, who noted that Memorial Day last year was 89 degrees.</p>
        <p>But many managed to make the best of the weather. Diehard beach combers dug their heels into the sand to the restful roar of the surf. The parks, while less crowded than usual for this time of year, had determined bicyclists, joggers and sunbathers, and cookout chefs were standing in a haze of sumptious smoke.</p>
        <p>At Yankee Stadium, about 20,000 fans showed up for a game between the Yankees and Brewers.</p>
        <p>"It's just a Monday with nothing to do," said Danny Mastro, 27 years old, of Manhattan, one of the fans. "If it were sunny, I'm sure a lot more people would be here."</p>
        <p>Shoppers, of course, flocked to area malls, lured by the promise of Memorial Day-sale bargains.</p>
        <p>Yet throughout the day, the nation's war dead were honored in public and private ceremonies. There were stirring speeches and flag waving, patriotic songs and salutes, and neighborhood parades in which veterans marched with prideful strides and children, too young to learn any lessons from war, were delighted by the rumble of drums and the blare of bugles. Attendance at Ceremonies Low</p>
        <p>Sadly for many who attended the memorial gatherings, attendance was often sparse, as veterans of the so-called great wars have died or have grown too old to march.</p>
        <p>This year there was no grand Memorial Day parade up Broadway in Manhattan, and the parade down the Grand Concourse in the Bronx was smaller and with fewer spectators than those of the past.</p>
        <p>At the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Riverside Park in Manhattan, a dozen or so uniformed men and women, some white-haired and frail, walked a short distance to place flowered wreaths of respect and remembrance at the foot of the old granite landmark. A Different Call to Arms</p>
        <p>Then, for almost an hour, more than 600 people, some holding American flags and bearing metals and ribbons of honor on their chest, listened quietly to brief speeches, prayers and patriotic music.</p>
        <p>Until this year, there had been a parade up Broadway and Riverside Drive leading to the monument on every Memorial Day since 1919. The New York County American Legion, which organized the parade over the years, did not apply for a parade permit this year, sensing that the years of declining attendance and participation called for a different, less showy symbol of remembrance.</p>
        <p>William Hay, 45, a Vietnam veteran who spoke during the ceremony, said the question to ask was what the war dead would want.</p>
        <p>"It is probably good for us who organize these things that the dead cannot speak, because we probably wouldn't like what they had to say," he told the audience. "Most of all they would ask us to stop adding to their rolls."</p>
        <p>The dead do not need parades and marches, Mr. Hay said. He said that they would prefer to have Americans answer a call to arms to defeat poverty, drug addition, child abuse and other social problems that he said plague the country. Tribute To a Downed Major</p>
        <p>In Mount Vernon, N.Y., as many as 400 spectators, some cheering heartily, lined downtown Gramatan Avenue to watch the teen-age pompom girls, the proud aging veterans and strutting school bands march in the city's annual Memorial Day parade.</p>
        <p>"This is a small town and small towns have a characteristic that is the strength of nation," said Irwyn Nelson, a Jewish war veteran and president of Mount Vernon's Central Committee of Veterans, which sponsored today's parade. "It's very beautiful and very natural and very worthwhile."</p>
        <p>In Oradell, N.J., the hometown of Maj. Marie Rossi, the first female commander to fly into battle, and the first to die while doing it, Gov. Jim Florio and the friends and family of Major Rossi gathered. There were also veterans of a half-century of American wars, including her husband, who served with her in the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Governor Florio unveiled a monument, an piece of granite bearing a plaque with her likeness, surrounded by a grove dedicated to her honor.</p>
        <p>"In the deepest part of my heart, I believe Marie is with me," said her husband, Chief Warrant Officer John Cayton. "And when she is smiling I feel it the deepest part of my body, and I believe she is smiling today." Some Crowds Were Found</p>
        <p>Major Rossi and two crewmen died last March when the Army Chinook helicopter she was piloting crashed in Northern Saudi Arabia in a non-combat accident the day after the cease-fire was announced.</p>
        <p>Only days previously, before the ground assault began, she had been interviewed on the Cable News Network. "What I am doing," she said then, "is no greater, or less, than the man who is flying next to me."</p>
        <p>The Governor said yesterday, "It was part of Marie's magic that somehow we all thought we knew her."</p>
        <p>All thoughts yesterday did not turn to duty and honor.</p>
        <p>In Central Park, Charles Gifford and his wife, Jerrilynn Dodds, both 41, sat playing with their two sons, Sandy, 7, and Theo, 2, on the patio of the Zoo Cafe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dodds, an architectural history professor at City College, said they chose to stay in the city this year because everybody else had gone away.</p>
        <p>At the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island, Steven and Talin Dosttur said they had thought they would beat the Memorial Day crowds by staying close to their Long Island home, putting off their vacation to Hershey, Pa., until next week.</p>
        <p>But as Mrs. Dosttur measured a blue-and-white striped polo shirt against her husband's back, getting jostled by passing customers in the men's department of Macy's, it became clear the crowds had found them.</p>
        <p>Much of the rest of Long Island took one look at this morning's overcast skies and surrendered any hope of tasting summer's traditional pleasures: sunbathing, swimming and cooking out.</p>
        <p>At Jones Beach, where parking tickets usually go on sale at 6 A.M., Cara O'Connor, who sells the tickets, said she did not bother opening the ticket window until 11:15.</p>
        <p>The three lifeguards there said they did not mind the cloudy skies and quiet day. "It's nice," said Kevin Doherty, 17. "We kind of needed a break."</p>
