        <p>Rock's past has rarely sounded as perfect as it does on the Black Crowes' second album, "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion"(Def American 26916; CD and cassette). The music has the jauntiness of 70's pub-rock bands like Faces, and the swaggering guitars should bring a smile to Keith Richards's face. The Crowes' lead singer, Chris Robinson, slurs lyrics like "music got to free your mind!" in a gravelly tone that recalls Joe Cocker. Even though the Crowes are in their 20's, unwitting listeners may feel they've stumbled on a typical FM rock station circa 1972.</p>
        <p>The re-creation isn't limited to the music, either. Mr. Robinson, who twirls his microphone stand and struts like a rooster in the best Rod Stewart fashion, wears bell bottoms. In an equally anachronistic move, the band recently played at a music festival in its hometown of Atlanta in support of the legalization of marijuana.</p>

        <p>Rock's past has rarely sounded as perfect as it does on the Black Crowes' second album, "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion"(Def American 26916; CD and cassette). The music has the jauntiness of 70's pub-rock bands like Faces, and the swaggering guitars should bring a smile to Keith Richards's face. The Crowes' lead singer, Chris Robinson, slurs lyrics like "music got to free your mind!" in a gravelly tone that recalls Joe Cocker. Even though the Crowes are in their 20's, unwitting listeners may feel they've stumbled on a typical FM rock station circa 1972.</p>
        <p>The re-creation isn't limited to the music, either. Mr. Robinson, who twirls his microphone stand and struts like a rooster in the best Rod Stewart fashion, wears bell bottoms. In an equally anachronistic move, the band recently played at a music festival in its hometown of Atlanta in support of the legalization of marijuana.</p>
        <p>Even though the Black Crowes were in kindergarten when such behavior was in vogue, the group sees itself as an</p>
        <p>authentic</p>
        <p>rock-and-roll band and approaches this idea with a missionary zeal. There are no elements of 90's styles like alternative rock or punk-funk here, nor hints of the 70's punk upheaval and certainly nothing resembling hip-hop rhythms. But what is "real" rock in 1992, and what does it say about the music when one of the genre's most popular young bands devotes itself so slavishly to the past?</p>
        <p>The Crowes have done well with revivalism and mimicry -- the new album entered the pop charts last week at No. 1. "Shake Your Money Maker," their 1990 debut album, sold 3 million copies with virtually no help from pop radio. The album was blatantly derivative: parts of it sounded like outtakes from the Rolling Stones' "Exile on Main Street." Still, rewrites of the Stones and other period rockers didn't get any better than the Crowes' single "Jealous Again," and the group's brashness and passion, symbolized by Mr. Robinson's throaty voice, made the record all the more likable. The album's success also spawned inevitable clones like the raspy singer Sass Jordan, whose debut album, "Racine," sounds more like the Black Crowes than they do.</p>
        <p>"The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion" takes the Black Crowes even deeper into classic-rock territory. The band pays greater attention to 70's instrumentation like organ and tambourines (no drum machines) and bluesy slide guitars. Black female backup singers, the kind heard on old Leon Russell albums, are thrown into the mix as if to show the band has grit and soul.</p>
        <p>Like the album's clunky title, the Crowes' quest for authenticity often seems awkward. The songs rely more on blues-rock riffs than melodies, and even the stronger tracks, like "Bad Luck Blue Eyes, Goodbye" (speaking of clunky titles), bog down in busy, extended arrangements. More problematic, Mr. Robinson moans, groans, shrieks and draws out syllables to often grotesque effect. His attempt at a soulful wail at the end of "Remedy," the album's first single, is painfully callow.</p>
        <p>Just as often, though, the Crowes sound as if they were born in platform shoes. Raveups like "Sting Me" and "Hotel Illness" have the effortless swing of old Stones singles. Longer, denser and more ambitious songs -- "Black Moon Creeping" and "My Morning Song" -- lather on molasses-thick guitar riffs and harmonica. Even though those songs owe more to Led Zeppelin's "When the Levee Breaks" than anything from the Mississippi Delta, no one has attempted such careening swamp blues in years. Incidentally, these songs ("heavy rock," in the old lingo) are grouped together on the album's second half, while the first half is dominated by moodier ballads -- a split that recalls the heyday of the good old LP.</p>
        <p>The LP is dead, though, and in many ways so is this style of music. Rock was once built on simple truths: a little bit of blues guitar, a little bit of rhythm-and-blues and soul and a lot of earnest, tortured-soul delivery. Those verities run through "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion" and, to a lesser extent, Bruce Springsteen's two current albums, "Lucky Town" and "Human Touch."</p>
        <p>Rather than push the music forward, though, both the Crowes and Mr. Springsteen essentially circle the wagons against intruders, be they rappers or techno bands. In their hands, white rock-and-roll becomes the equivalent of bluegrass or Chicago blues -- hermetically sealed musical ghettos frozen in time, forever pure and undiluted.</p>
        <p>Rock was never supposed to be this reactionary, and by and large it isn't. All around the Black Crowes, the music has become more sardonic and flexible, and it increasingly incorporates harder rhythms, guitar squalor, and technical innovations ranging from sampling to sequencers. Like it or not, those trends are the sound of rock in the 90's, and some of them even represent progress. As charged and riveting as parts of "The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion" are, it is ultimately a quaint reminder of an era that resides comfortably in history books.</p>
