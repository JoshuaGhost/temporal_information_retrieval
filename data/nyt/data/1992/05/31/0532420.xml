        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was delighted to read "After the Pay Revolution, Job Titles Won't Matter" (May 17). My transition from work in the interdisciplinary arts to business was hampered by the traditional view of employees and resumes.</p>
        <p>Many of the skills I had acquired were readily transferable to the private sector. The accumulation of more of these capabilities -- in word processing, say, or in transferring writing skills from poetry and playwriting to press releases and speeches -- was readily taken advantage of but not properly compensated.</p>
        <p>Academic credentials completely unrelated to the tasks at hand often rewarded neophytes with upward mobility. The result sometimes included demoralization of workers who had the greater capabilities and seniority, as well as poor overall management because the new junior executive did not have as much hands-on experience as his or her own staff.
