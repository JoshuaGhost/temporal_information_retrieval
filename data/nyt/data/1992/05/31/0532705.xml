        <p>Lois Nesbitt, a conceptual artist, has devised a New York walking tour that almost no one would want to go on. The tour maps are covered with 50 black spots: each one represents a commercial or nonprofit gallery that has closed since 1989.</p>
        <p>During this month, Ms. Nesbitt has put up 3-by-6-inch stickers, below, at each closed gallery to match up with the map.</p>
        <p>"The stickers identify the galleries as fossils," said Ms. Nesbitt, who is also a writer for Arts, Elle and Artforum magazines. "The idea of the fossils is that the gallery is becoming an endangered species. SoHo is like a ghost town. But it's not just prestigious avant-garde art spaces. It's also conservative spaces on 57th Street that have closed."</p>
        <p>While putting up the stickers at one building on Broadway, Ms. Nesbitt was approached by a security guard.</p>
        <p>"It was a Saturday night," she said. "I heard this voice say, 'What are these?' but I just kept putting them up. He finally said he wasn't going to do anything and walked away. Tuesday morning, however, they were all gone. The buildings' owners don't want it to look like they have empty spaces."</p>
        <p>Ms. Nesbitt's tour is part of "The Power of the City; The City of Power," a current show at the Whitney Museum of American Art's downtown branch at Federal Reserve Plaza. The exhibition is especially poignant because it is the last show at the museum, which is closing July 10.</p>
