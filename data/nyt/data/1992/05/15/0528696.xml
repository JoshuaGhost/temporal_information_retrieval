        <p>Tests of more than 15,000 people have found no new cases in which patients were infected with the virus that causes AIDS from treatment by health-care workers, Federal health officials reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>The only known such transmission of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, involves five previously reported cases in the practice of a Florida dentist, Dr. David J. Acer of Stuart, who died of AIDS. One of Dr. Acer's patients was Kimberly Bergalis, who died last year of AIDS at the age of 23. She had harshly criticized public health officials for allowing Dr. Acer to practice.</p>

        <p>Tests of more than 15,000 people have found no new cases in which patients were infected with the virus that causes AIDS from treatment by health-care workers, Federal health officials reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>The only known such transmission of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, involves five previously reported cases in the practice of a Florida dentist, Dr. David J. Acer of Stuart, who died of AIDS. One of Dr. Acer's patients was Kimberly Bergalis, who died last year of AIDS at the age of 23. She had harshly criticized public health officials for allowing Dr. Acer to practice.</p>
        <p>A bitter feud has developed between the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and many health-care workers, civil libertarians and advocates for H.I.V.-infected people over guidelines for health-care workers developed by the Federal agency. Stalled Guidelines</p>
        <p>The disease-control agency initially planned to list procedures that health-care workers who are infected with the virus should not perform and had strong support from the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association and some other professional groups. The guidelines had been approved by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>But then the medical and dental associations reversed their position, saying there was no scientifically valid way to draw up such a list.</p>
        <p>Last December, the disease-control agency dropped the planned list and revised the guidelines. Although agency officials have repeatedly said that the new guidelines would be issued soon, Dr. Sullivan has not acted on them.</p>
        <p>In reports being published today in the agency's weekly report and in The Annals of Internal Medicine, Federal and state health officials said the most vexing part of their investigation was the inability to determine the precise way in which H.I.V. was spread in Dr. Acer's practice.</p>
        <p>The most likely explanation is that the virus was spread from Dr. Acer to the five patients, and not from patient to patient through contaminated instruments or equipment like a high-speed dental tool, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>The controversy also led health officials to review test results of 15,795 patients who were treated by 32 H.I.V.-infected health-care workers. No infected patients were found in the practices of 23 of the 32. They included 11 dentists or dental students; six surgeons and obstetricians, and six other physicians in various nonsurgical specialties.</p>
        <p>The remaining nine included five dentists and four surgeons and obstetricians. Of the 5,526 patients tested in their practices, 84 were H.I.V.-infected and follow-up tests were completed on 47 and are in progress on the remaining 37. Seven of the 47 were in high-risk groups like gay men or intravenous drug users and five more were infected before they were treated by the infected health-care worker.</p>
        <p>The remaining 35 were male inmates in a state correctional facility who were treated by an infected dentist, and 33 were in high-risk groups. Because the dentist had died before scientists could do genetic studies on his H.I.V., there is no way to know for sure whether they were infected by the dentist, said Dr. James Curran, an AIDS expert at the agency.</p>
        <p>The lack of a viral specimen was one of several problems that hampered the investigation, the health officials said.</p>
        <p>Because appointment books and other records could not be found for a few infected health-care workers, there was no way of knowing the exact number of patients they treated.</p>
        <p>The scientists said it was likely that transmission from a health-care worker to a patient would be found again sometime because the risk, though very small, is not zero. However, the experts stressed that there was a much greater risk of transmission of H.I.V. from infected patient to health-care worker than vice versa.</p>
