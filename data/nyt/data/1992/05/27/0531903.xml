        <p>The Coast Guard returned the first boatload of Haitians to Port-au-Prince today under President Bush's new policy of accepting no more refugees at the United States naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, the White House announced.</p>
        <p>The decision to return Haitians without giving them immigration hearings at Guantanamo has been bitterly denounced by human rights organizations.</p>
        <p>The policy has been to grant refugee status only to those who can establish during interviews at Guantanamo that they are political, not economic, refugees. Human rights groups say the stricter policy is morally indefensible, runs counter to the identity of the United States as a nation of immigrants and will only encourage other countries to follow suit.</p>
        <p>The change also drew criticism from Gov. Bill Clinton, who has all but locked up the Democratic Presidential nomination. Asked in Little Rock, Ark., today whether he approved of the Bush policy on Haiti, he said:</p>
        <p>"If I were President, in the absence of clear and compelling evidence that they were not political refugees, I would give them temporary asylum here until we restored the elected Government of Haiti. I would turn up the heat and try to restore the elected Government and meanwhile let the refugees stay here."</p>
        <p>Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, said he would introduce either a resolution or a bill to require the Administration to interview Haitian boat people on the high seas to determine whether they were entitled to refugee status.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's new guidelines were announced Sunday in an effort to stem the outflow of refugees. Haitians have been taking to sea in flimsy boats by the hundreds in recent days.</p>
        <p>Today, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, announced at a briefing that "a handful of Haitians were rescued at sea this morning and are being returned." There were 38 Haitians on the boat.</p>
        <p>A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said that the refugees were told they could apply for asylum at the United States Embassy in Port-au-Prince, and that 17 had agreed and were taken to the embassy to fill out forms. 'Most Rational Approach'</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater said the Haiti issue was a "difficult" one but that President Bush's change in policy -- which seemed to take many State Department officials by surprise -- was necessary.</p>
        <p>"We have thousands of people on the seas that are being threatened -- 18 died yesterday or the day before -- and people are dying every day on these little ships that they're trying to take out," he said. "The most rational approach in terms of safety and humanitarian concerns is to try to process these applications at the embassy, and those that are qualified are then granted asylum."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless the new policy was roundly denounced by human rights organizations.</p>
        <p>"I empathize with the Government," said the Rev. Richard Ryscavage, head of the Office of Migration and Refugee Services of the United States Catholic Conference. "They are in a difficult bind. But this policy is a national tragedy because it represents a turning of our backs on our very core tradition of receiving newcomers." Father Ryscavage's office is under contract from the Justice Department to provide social and legal services to Haitian immigrants. 'Short-Sighted Quick Fix'</p>
        <p>Father Ryscavage said the new policy was a "short-sighted quick fix that will ultimately backfire, because unless you deal with the core issues you will have continuing emigration, and the core issue is not migration -- the core issue is Haiti."</p>
        <p>Lionel Rosenblatt, executive director of Refugees International, said the policy "only gives other countries license to turn back refugees from around the world without the right to assert political-refugee status."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt recalled that in 1980, tens of thousands of Cubans fled to Florida quickly by boat, and that President Jimmy Carter was was hurt politically because he was seen as having lost control of the situation.</p>
        <p>"That was an election year and this is an election year," he said.</p>
        <p>More United States officials are acknowledging that something needs to be done if Haiti is going to be stabilized, but they insist that they are caught between two fundamental problems.</p>
        <p>On one side, they say, is the fact that the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected President who was ousted Sept. 30, was an imperfect democrat at best. Father Aristide intimidated many opponents with threats to unleash his political supporters on them, and thus his return to Haiti is still looked upon with great ambivalence by many in the military, in business and in Parliament.</p>
        <p>On the other side, officials say, is the fact that the coalition of army, business and parliamentary figures who ousted Father Aristide have not coalesced into a coherent political force that could run the country.</p>
        <p>Power in Port-au-Prince today is so widely dispersed that many of the sanctions introduced by the Organization of American States have had little political impact but an enormously negative economic impact.</p>
        <p>Therefore, some officials say that what is needed in Haiti is some sort of international apparatus or peacekeeping force. It could insure that Father Aristide's return would not unnerve the opposition or leave him feeling vulnerable to another coup. This could provide some time for the country to introduce the political and economic reforms needed for a long-term solution.</p>
