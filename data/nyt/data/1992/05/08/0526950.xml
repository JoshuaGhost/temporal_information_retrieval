        <p>The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said today that the ill effects on the economy from bankers' reduced willingness to extend new loans was abating.</p>
        <p>While standing by his comments earlier this year that weakness in the financial system, including banks, was hurting the economy, Mr. Greenspan said the regulators were not to blame. He said the tougher financial standards for banks did not cause banks to reduce business lending and instead to increase their holdings of government securities sharply. Rather, he said, that trend "reflects mainly weak loan demand."</p>
        <p>Although the economy and bank lending habits are not back to normal, Mr. Greenspan said, "Things are improving." He said the stronger financial condition of businesses, consumers and banks would bode well for future economic growth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan's comments, made at a conference here sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, appeared to counter critics in Congress who attribute the weakness in bank lending to regulators' rules, which do not count investments in government securities when calculating a bank's capital requirement, but do count all business loans.</p>
        <p>The Fed chairman noted that tougher capital requirements were imposed on banks at about the time the economy turned down, and added that banks traditionally increased securities purchases when loan demand slackened. He said that another reason for the drop in bank loans was that some businesses had raised money to repay loans by selling more stock or issuing long-term bonds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan also took a broad swipe at the banking law approved last year, saying that it is so restrictive that it could harm the economy.</p>
        <p>He also strongly implied that when it came to writing the scores of regulations to enforce the act, he intended to promote looser regulations on everything from compensation and loans to bankers to record-keeping, lending and capital standards.</p>
        <p>The new law, he said, "requires the agencies to establish highly undesirable regulations that involve substantial micro-management" and puts the Government perilously close to being in the business of "credit allocation," referring to decisions about whom banks lend to and in what amounts. Not the Government's Job</p>
        <p>"Credit allocation is -- and I fervently hope will remain -- the job of bankers, not Government," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan has long sought legislation to make it easier and cheaper for banks to enter the securities and insurance industries. Congress rejected such legislation last year. It had been proposed by the Administration, but fell victim to a heavy lobbying campaign against it by community bankers and securities and insurance interests.</p>
        <p>Instead, Congress adopted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, which gave regulators the authority to borrow billions of dollars from the Treasury to bail out insolvent banks and generally tightened restrictions on the industry. The Federal Reserve and the other bank regulatory agencies have begun writing dozens of regulations to enforce the Act.</p>
        <p>"We must work to be sure that all of these provisions are implemented in a way that preserves the decision-making role of bankers," Mr. Greenspan said, "while permitting agencies to identify institutions that take what would be widely agreed are excessive risks or engage in inappropriate practices." Glimmer of More Demand</p>
        <p>David J. Vitale, executive vice-president at the First National Bank of Chicago noted that "there are glimmerings of improved loan demand" as more companies are talking about their credit needs with the bank, although they are not yet increasing their borrowings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vitale, who attended the conference, said in an interview that he expected that when lending increases, it might not increase the size of the Chicago bank. Like many other large banks, First Chicago has been an active seller of loans to reduce the amount of capital it needs to satisfy regulatory requirements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vitale said that capital requirements would probably rise for large banks that are active in the securities and foreign exchange markets and in selling interest rate swaps and options on interest rates and currencies. "They may not require the additional capital all at once, but my gut feeling is that when regulators have an opportunity to require more capital, they will," Mr. Vitale said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan said American regulators would probably issue early this summer proposals for capital requirements based on the risks banks face from fluctuating interest rates.</p>
