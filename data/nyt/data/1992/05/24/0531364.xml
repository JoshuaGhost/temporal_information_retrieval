        <p>In his letter to the New Jersey editor on May 3, Dr. Neal Barnard continues to maintain that the toxicity of penicillin to guinea pigs demonstrates that animal experimentation is of little benefit to humans. In support of this view Dr. Barnard cites the fact that sick guinea pigs are treated with sulfa drugs.</p>
        <p>There is irony in this citation. The sulfa drugs are a classic example of an entire family of drugs that could not have been discovered without the use of animal testing.</p>

        <p>In his letter to the New Jersey editor on May 3, Dr. Neal Barnard continues to maintain that the toxicity of penicillin to guinea pigs demonstrates that animal experimentation is of little benefit to humans. In support of this view Dr. Barnard cites the fact that sick guinea pigs are treated with sulfa drugs.</p>
        <p>There is irony in this citation. The sulfa drugs are a classic example of an entire family of drugs that could not have been discovered without the use of animal testing.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's Dr. Domagk was evaluating the antibacterial activity of a dye called prontosil. Had he simply added to the dye to cultures of streptococci, he would have concluded that prontosil was useless. Instead, he infected mice with streptococci and then administered the dye to the mice. The mice were cured. Subsequent studies showed that prontosil is attacked by the liver and split into two compounds, one of which is sulfanilamide.</p>
        <p>The story has yet another chapter. Research into the mode of action of sulfanilamide led to the recognition that the sulfa drugs function as "folate antagonists." This in turn led directly to the development of a number of other folate antagonists (e.g., methotrexate) that have proven to be very important for cancer chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>All this occurred only because Dr. Domagk decided to use animals for his experiments. DAVID KAFKEWITZ, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Microbiology Rutgers, Newark</p>
