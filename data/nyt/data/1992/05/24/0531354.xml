        <p>DESPITE the recession, some small businesses are thriving. Last Wednesday, in conjunction with National Small Business Week, 14 of them were named Westchester winners for their performance as the fastest-growing successful small companies in the county by the Westchester Small Business Council, an affiliate of the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>"In order to be considered for an award, each business had to meet specific requirements," said Edward Murray, executive president of the County Chamber of Commerce. "Each of the companies had to have a five-year sales history of continuous growth pattern. They also had to have obtained at least $150,000 or less than $25 million in sales in 1991, with 50 percent of their revenues coming from Westchester."</p>

        <p>DESPITE the recession, some small businesses are thriving. Last Wednesday, in conjunction with National Small Business Week, 14 of them were named Westchester winners for their performance as the fastest-growing successful small companies in the county by the Westchester Small Business Council, an affiliate of the County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>"In order to be considered for an award, each business had to meet specific requirements," said Edward Murray, executive president of the County Chamber of Commerce. "Each of the companies had to have a five-year sales history of continuous growth pattern. They also had to have obtained at least $150,000 or less than $25 million in sales in 1991, with 50 percent of their revenues coming from Westchester."</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray said he saw the achievements of these small companies as a cause for optimism -- "a good sign that the severe downturn in the Northeast may be over and recovery on the way."</p>
        <p>The experiences of two of the winning companies -- Special Deliveries in Port Chester and Bosco, Johnn &amp; Company in Valhalla -- are typical of small businesses that are thriving in the county.</p>
        <p>Special Deliveries, which offers home delivery of cloth diapers, was started by John Bemis, a former aerospace executive. Mr. Bemis, who for 10 years was the director of marketing and business development for a large international aerospace corporation, said he started his business because he had a strong desire to be his own boss.</p>
        <p>When he was asked about his unusual choice of a business, he replied that while he was exploring business opportunities, he came across several articles that encouraged him to start the diaper service.</p>
        <p>"The signs pointed toward it," he said. "It seemed to me to be an idea whose time had come -- again. In my research I kept coming across articles about the new baby boom, dual-income families and concerns about the environment.</p>
        <p>"I put them all together and figured that obviously there were more new working mothers, and Earth Day had raised everyone's awareness: environmentalists began to worry about what was going to happen to all those mountains of disposable diapers, which really weren't disposable. I began to think the days of the throwaway society were numbered. Recycling was the new mandate, and new mothers were older and more aware of such concerns."</p>
        <p>And in the frugal 1990's, Mr. Bemis added, price was also a strong consideration.</p>
        <p>"I worked it out that I could deliver 80 cloth diapers a week to a customer for 20 percent less than what it would cost her to buy the same number of a major brand of disposable diapers," he said. "That's $13 for ours compared to $20 a week for theirs."</p>
        <p>He said that he was still not entirely convinced that a diaper service company would be profitable until he came up with an idea for cross-selling, "which is the kind of thing the fast-food companies like McDonald's have done very well."</p>
        <p>"It means when people order a hamburger, you sell them french fries and a Coke," he explained. "With me, it would mean I'd provide customers with ancillary products and services, such things as baby formula, diaper covers and breast pumps."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bemis's marketing experience stood him in good stead. Now, he said, more than 30 percent of his volume is generated through sales of ancillary products.</p>
        <p>"In the industry they call me a trailblazer for my concept of selling compatible products," he said. "I've just come back from our convention, where I was told by other people in the business that they have adopted my idea and they are having success with it."</p>
        <p>Yet, Mr. Bemis cautioned, starting a business from scratch isn't easy. "It means working 14-hour days seven days a week and having a wife with a good job," he said. "My wife, Nancy, is director of marketing at American Movie Classics, cable's black-and-white movie channel, and it was her support and her salary that helped me survive that first year until we crept into the black."</p>
        <p>The first year in business, Mr. Bemis said, he was a one-man band. "The only thing I didn't do was laundry," he said. "I had that done outside. But I did all the pickups and the deliveries. I put 55,000 miles on the truck. I sent out direct mail. I visited hospitals in hopes of getting contracts. I went over the books. And in the evenings or early in the morning I would visit potential customers in their homes and give them what I hoped was useful advice."</p>
        <p>What he learned, he said, was that the hardest-working people in the world are small-business men and women: "The corporate executive has it easy by comparison." A 'Self-Destruct' Business</p>
        <p>Mr. Bemis, who eventually bought out two competitors, Mother Nature in Port Chester and Cuddles in Pleasantville, now has a staff of four.</p>
        <p>"When I bought Mother Nature, I got a laundry along with it," he said. "The laundry's not a problem anymore. What is a problem in this business is that it is self-destruct. Right now we have 300 active customers, but since the length of time we can count on them staying with us is only two years, generating new business is a constant and critical undertaking."</p>
        <p>Currently, Mr. Bemis is trying to get day-care centers to use cloth diapers. He is also adding new products, like a fitted all-in-one cloth diaper with a waterproof cover.</p>
        <p>A different type of business is the certified public accounting firm of Bosco, Johnn &amp; Company with offices in the Mount Pleasant Corporate Center in Valhalla. The company has generated a 25 percent yearly increase in business during the three worst years of the recession.</p>
        <p>What's more, , the growth has been achieved despite a slump in business for many of the firm's clients, predominantly builders and others in the real estate industry, said one of the principals, Richard Bosco, who formed the company with Ronald Johnn in 1985.</p>
        <p>"The change in the tax law in 1986 precipitated the recession," Mr. Bosco said. "It so adversely affected real estate investors that people with money stopped buying. Properties became a glut on the market, and new construction virtually dried up."</p>
        <p>The result, Mr. Bosco said, was that his firm's clients, construction industries that survived, needed more, not fewer, accounting services.</p>
        <p>"Companies found when they were cutting back they had to restructure," he said. "We have been helping our clients get financing, and we have been acting as go-betweens between the banks and bonding companies. In one case, we put a general contractor into a joint venture with another client of ours, a landscape architectural firm. They are stronger together than either one was alone."</p>
        <p>In uncertain economic times, Mr. Bosco added, his firm has been asked to supply additional financial, accounting and tax services to clients who have cut down or eliminated their internal accounting staffs.</p>
        <p>"These clients want personal service, and they need truly accurate information," he said. "We perform for them out-of-house as if we were part of their staff. Clients come to us by word of mouth. With the increase in business we have enjoyed, we have been able to add three additional C.P.A.'s to our firm."</p>
        <p>The other 1992 Westchester winners are Absolutely Write of Valhalla, Adco Federal Alarm Systems of Port Chester, Brucci Limited of Yonkers, Canopy Roofing Systems of Mamaroneck, Headquarters Companies of Rye, Judicial Abstract Corporation of White Plains, Laurevan Shoe Corporation of Yonkers, Miller's Toys of Mamaroneck, Physicians Health Services of New York in White Plains, T's and Teams of White Plains, Treasurers in Jewelry of Scarsdale and Visitrak International Corporation of Pleasantville.</p>
