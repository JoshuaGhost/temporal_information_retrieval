        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Though your reviewer doesn't mention it, there is an obvious fallacy in Richard A. Epstein's attack on employment-discrimination laws in his book "Forbidden Grounds" (May 3). The right-wing libertarian argument that government should use its coercive power only against "violence" or "fraud" and not interfere with freedom of contract recognizes only violence by individual criminals. But businesses that use their economic power to deny whole classes of people the opportunity to make a decent living commit violence as surely as any robber. The same can be said of a group of people (whites, men) that exercises its collective social power to consign another group (blacks, women) to inferior status -- whether or not that status is written into law.</p>

        <p>Though your reviewer doesn't mention it, there is an obvious fallacy in Richard A. Epstein's attack on employment-discrimination laws in his book "Forbidden Grounds" (May 3). The right-wing libertarian argument that government should use its coercive power only against "violence" or "fraud" and not interfere with freedom of contract recognizes only violence by individual criminals.

        <p>Free marketeers like Mr. Epstein imagine that the government has a monopoly on coercive power. In fact, employers, through their control of economic resources, exercise far more power over most people's daily lives. Subject to minimal restraints, they determine how jobs are defined, organized and rewarded, what working conditions employees must conform to and what behavior is acceptable on or even off the job. (When thousands of people have to urinate into bottles to get hired --</p>
        <p>that's</p>
        <p>coercion!)</p>
        <p>But, of course, these realities raise a question that goes far beyond antidiscrimination law: is corporate capitalism itself incompatible with a free society? ELLEN WILLIS Brooklyn</p>
