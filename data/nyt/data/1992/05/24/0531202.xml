        <p>At first glance, it might seem that bright lights are not among the things of which Times Square is most in need.</p>
        <p>But a second glance, particularly down the long side streets, reveals dark stretches that add to a sense of nighttime danger.</p>
        <p>At the prompting of Community Board 5, the Times Square Business Improvement District has begun a $1.45 million project to put up 80 to 100 new lights in the area. These will be 45 feet high (about 20 feet higher than the poles they are to replace) and designed to wash the sidewalks, not just the road, in light.</p>
        <p>"The enjoyment of Times Square has been dimmed in recent years by people's perception of the area as dangerous," said Gretchen Dykstra, the president of the business improvement district organization. "Well-lit sidewalks will greatly enhance their level of comfort."</p>
        <p>For the sake of practicality, Ms. Dykstra said, the poles will be bought "off the shelf." The fixtures will be the standard "cobra-head" type that predominates in New York City. On some poles, spotlights will be affixed to shine on the exteriors of nearby theaters and other landmarks. All poles will have attachments from which banners can hang.</p>
        <p>The lighting program is being designed by the firm of Jules Fisher &amp; Paul Marantz of Manhattan. Ms. Dykstra said it should take about two years.</p>
        <p>The initial financing comes from the Times Square Public Purpose Fund, which originated as payments made by the Marriott Marquis Hotel in lieu of taxes. Future maintenance will come out of assessments of property owners in the district, which runs roughly from the Avenue of the Americas to Eighth Avenue, 40th to 53d Street.</p>
