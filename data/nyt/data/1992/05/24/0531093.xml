        <p>When Filipinos voted in 1986, the election was decided not by the rigged tallies, but by huge "people power" demonstrations that ultimately ousted the ostensible winner, Ferdinand E. Marcos, and installed Corazon C. Aquino as President.</p>
        <p>But this weekend, as the painfully slow process of tabulating results in the latest presidential election enters its third week, the determining factor is not people power but electric power.</p>
        <p>Whatever her accomplishments in establishing democracy in the Philippines, Mrs. Aquino has failed to keep the lights on. Daily blackouts have not only shuttered factories and brought the economy to a near halt; they have knocked out the fax machines, the computers and even the reading lamps needed to count the ballots. And in the darkness, many suspect, funny things may be happening to the numbers.</p>
        <p>The power failures are a result of aged and failing generators that seem a symbol for the huge economic problems that ultimately crippled Mrs. Aquino's rule, problems so severe that many here say the election winner will soon envy the six losers. The economy is contracting, half the populace lives in poverty, inflation is raging. But for the time being, the Philippines' collapsing infrastructure also seems to be providing a covenient cover for vote tampering from many parties. 'Opportunity for Fraud'</p>
        <p>"The institutional structures allow opportunity for fraud," Raul Locsin, the vice chairman of a Government-sanctioned watchdog group assembling the unofficial numbers, Media Citizen Quick Count, which is financed by news organizations and businesses.</p>
        <p>"But power failures allow more time for dishonesty and manipulation," he said, walking around a huge gymnasium here where the results are being tabulated by volunteers, "We don't know it is happening, but the longer this goes on the bigger the problem."</p>
        <p>Even the man who everyone expects to win, Fidel V. Ramos, a former general and a cousin of the late Mr. Marcos who ultimately helped dethrone him, said today that he was "certainly quite worried" that his lead could wash away "by some magic."</p>
        <p>Late tonight, the unofficial count showed that Mr Ramos's lead had widened to slightly more than a million votes, giving him nearly 25 percent of the 14 million ballots counted so far, with results yet to come from 38 percent of the precincts. Ramos Is Confident</p>
        <p>In an interview today at a hotel here -- there was no power in his office -- he said, "I am confident of my enventual victory." But even with more than 60 percent of the vote in, he declined to declare himself the winner for fear of being perceived as grabbing for the prize and because.</p>
        <p>"a lot could happen in the next few days."</p>
        <p>But Government officials and a number of foreign diplomats here say that the fraud charges are overblown and that they doubt they would change the outcome of the national elections.</p>
        <p>The forces that Mr. Ramos was referring to belong largely to Eduardo Cojuangco, a 56-year old businessman widely associated with the national plunder of the Marcos dictatorship. Mr. Cojuangco is the estranged cousin of Mrs. Aquino -- who campaigned hard for Mr. Ramos -- and he is also one of the richest men in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>Since he returned home from exile in 1989 he has built up a huge network of supporters, many of whom openly say that the only way to get the country back on track, and the electricity switched on, is to elect another authoritarian figure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cojuangco agrees that fraud is afoot, but says it is being orchestrated by Mrs. Aquino's Government. His strategy appears to be to narrow the vote disparity with Mr. Ramos enough to throw the election into Congress, where deals can be cut and, if history is any guide, votes can be bought.</p>
        <p>The only other candidate still in the race, though she is fading fast, is the acid-tounged former head of immigration in the Philippines, Miriam Defensor Santiago. Mrs. Santiago, who is known throughout the county simply as Miriam, has run on an anticorruption platform and has complained the loudest that the election is being stolen. But her calls for street demonstrations have fallen on deaf ears.</p>
        <p>Known for a dramatic flair even by Philippine standards -- she recently called one congressman "fungus face" -- Mrs. Santiago today checked herself into a hospital and began a liquid fast, "to the death, if necessary," to protest fraud.</p>
        <p>The most famous candidate running for President, Imelda Marcos, the former First Lady, received only about 10 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Marcos, who returned to Manila last year, seems to have shifted her attention to other matters. After initially defying a court order to appear on charges of funneling money out of the country, she changed her mind, prompted by the threat that she would be moved out of her palacial hotel suite and into a jail cell.</p>
        <p>Newspapers here reported today that she was seeking the return of property the Government seized after the 1986 revolution, including a major Manila newspaper and, naturally, her famed collection of 1,200 pairs of shoes.</p>
        <p>While there are few doubts that some election returns have been falsified as they wend their way to Manila, it is far from clear that the elections are being fixed on a broad scale. The delays can be explained, at least in part, by the tremendous complexity of the ballot, which was over a foot and a half long. Ballots Read Aloud</p>
        <p>Under the election rules, each of the ballots had to be read aloud, in the presence of poll watchers who could challenge the validity of the polling sheet. The sheets themselves have an elaborate serial number system that allows some tracking of the ballot while prserving the voter's anonymity, including the voter's fingerprint. But because so many local elections were at stake, there have been an enormous number of challenges to certain votes, each preventing other results from the ballot from being reported to Manila.</p>
        <p>An American studying the process in Cebu, on an island south of the main island of Luzon, said that in many schools where the counting was taking place the lights frequently failed and ballots were read off by candlelight. "Everyone would bar the door," she said, so that ballot boxes did not disappear in the hands of armed marauders, a frequent event in the 1986 election.</p>
        <p>The tabulations were then sent to municipal and provincial officials, a lengthy process that added days to the count and offered numerous opportunities for fraud. Some are still stuck there, for reasons no one seems able to explain. Eventually they are passed on to a central Government elections commission and Quick Count.</p>
        <p>But so far the process has been peaceful, and devoid of protests.</p>
        <p>"People power is not in play this time," said Mr. Locsin, who is also publisher of a business newspaper here. "In 1986 you had the polarization of good and evil. This time people like the way democracy is going."</p>
