        <p>When Bill Clinton wants to galvanize his audience, he thunders from the podium that the top 1 percent of families got 60 percent of the gains from economic growth during the 1980's and owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</p>

        <p>When Bill Clinton wants to galvanize his audience, he thunders from the podium that the top 1 percent of families got 60 percent of the gains from economic growth during the 1980's and owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Governor Clinton, the likely Democratic Presidential nominee, had been searching for months for facts to illustrate his claim that America's middle class benefited little from 12 years of Republican rule. The explosion of riches at the top struck him as a perfect vehicle. Not only did the widening gap between the rich and the rest of Americans conflict with traditional notions of democracy, but it also went right to the pocketbook sources of middle-class discontent.</p>
        <p>"He was reading the paper that morning and went crazy," said Dee Dee Myers, the campaign's press secretary, referring to an article in The New York Times on March 5 that reported on the wildly disproportionate gains of the top 1 percent. "The story proved a point he had been trying to make for months, so he added the statistic to his repertoire."</p>
        <p>"The L.A. riots underscore the problem," she added.  Response by Republicans</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is one of the few Presidential candidates since Harry S. Truman to woo the middle class by pummeling the rich. And the Texas billionaire Ross Perot has climbed aboard the same bandwagon by casting himself as a tax-the-millionaires populist.</p>
        <p>The furor over the rich getting richer infuriates Republicans. And they have responded to Mr. Clinton's claims with vitriolic salvos of their own. The Joint Economic Committee's annual minority report accuses Democrats of using Joseph Stalin's approach to rewriting history. Supply-side architects of the Reagan tax cuts blasted the figures as "propaganda, not data." Even the President's notably unemotional economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, said he was livid.</p>
        <p>The White House itself took the unusual step of delivering an editorial response signed by the President's counselor for domestic policy, Clayton K. Yeutter. The piece, which ran on the Op-Ed page of The Times on March 24, stressed that everybody gained from the 1980's economic expansion.</p>
        <p>Oddly, when the Congressional Budget Office first released its income data -- the numbers that are now being hurled on the hustings -- only a handful of Congressional aides and professional economists paid much attention. And even after the economist Paul R. Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology crunched the numbers and concluded that the major share of the gains in average family income between 1977 to 1989 had gone to the richest of the rich, he had trouble getting anyone to listen.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Krugman's arithmetic ultimately crystallized the issue in much the same way that the misery index -- the sum of inflation and unemployment -- confirmed what ordinary voters felt had gone wrong during the years of Jimmy Carter's Presidency. And Mr. Krugman's calculation also helped focus the fierce political debate over who won -- and who lost -- from economic growth in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>One reason that the issue remained relatively invisible for so long -- in spite of broad agreement among academic economists that income and wealth have grown more unequal -- is that statistics on distribution are among the mushiest and murkiest in economics. There are literally dozens of ways to slice and dice the data, not to mention hundreds of different data series.</p>
        <p>Confronted by Republican legislators after Governor Clinton started peppering his speeches with the statistic on the top 1 percent, the budget office was called upon to assess the Krugman calculation. Several weeks later, it issued a report that gave a number of alternate measures of the gains by the top 1 percent. Every measure showed that the top 1 percent of families reaped an outsized share of the gains.</p>
        <p>By one calculation 70 percent of the rise in average after-tax family income went to the top 1 percent, rather than the 60 percent figure that Mr. Krugman had initially estimated and that Governor Clinton has been using. If income gains for the top 1 percent had been the same as for the average family, the budget office economists point out, just 7 percent of the rise would have gone to the very rich.</p>
        <p>Adjusting for the fact that families in 1989 were smaller, on average, than families in 1977, 44 percent of the gains went to the the top 1 percent. Budget office economists argue that upward adjustments of the average income gain for all families to reflect that each family's income was spread over fewer people is a more accurate way of portraying what happened to the well-being of families in the middle. Mr. Krugman responds that the adjustment is irrelevant to the question of what happened to the fruits of economic growth. Other Gains by the Very Rich</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office also reports other ways of looking at the gains of the very rich. The top 1 percent's share of total after-tax income jumped from 7 percent to 12 percent, for example. And 25 percent of the $830 billion rise in the aggregate income of all families -- two-thirds of which reflected an increase in the number of families -- went to the top 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Most conservatives, including Mr. Boskin, are not happy with the budget office's figures, even after the data were adjusted to accommodate some of their criticisms.</p>
        <p>Arguing that the office's data base is flawed, they say that the figures exaggerate the income gains of the rich by including, for example, capital gains; understate the income of everyone else by underestimating incomes in the bottom quintiles; and lump together the Carter and Reagan years by using 1977 or 1979 as a base year. Conservatives' Arguments</p>
        <p>"The numbers show that the worst of inequality seems to have built up between 1977 and 1981," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns and a former budget official in the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boskin said, "While there has been some increase in inequality in the last two decades, it is far less than some people allege, and its causes -- primarily demographic and labor market shifts -- have little to do with economic policy."</p>
        <p>"Krugman's 70 percent calculation is not the answer to meaningful questions you'd want to ask," he added. Besides, Republicans say, measuring income shares in a mobile society is as meaningless as measuring which bubbles are at the top of the blender at a given moment in time.</p>
        <p>"The whole concept of a static layered society is false except for the underclass," said George Gilder, author of "The Spirit of Enterprise." Liberals' Responses</p>
        <p>Liberals, including Mr. Krugman, see things differently. They argue that capital gains do not distort the overall income data nearly as much as conservatives have claimed, largely because the fastest-growing component of the income at the very top was salaries.</p>
        <p>They also respond that measuring the growth of inequality from 1982, the bottom of the worst postwar recession, as Republicans wish to do, swamps any trend in the data. Even so, they point out, the rich even got richer during the expansionary portion of the business cycle -- a time when the poor usually increase their share of total income.</p>
        <p>And they maintain that mobility was just as great in 1977 as in 1989, so the fact that people can move up and down the economic ladder does nothing to offset the trend toward greater inequality. Republicans Foresaw a Problem</p>
        <p>And while no single calculation represents the truth and every data set has drawbacks, Mr. Krugman and others said, a large number of different measures using different data sources show that the very rich have done far better than everyone else.</p>
        <p>Take wages. "There is complete unanimity on the facts," said Lawrence H. Katz, an economist at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>Finis Welch, an economist at the Rand Corporation and the University of California at Los Angeles, said, "The farther up you were the more you gained; the farther down you were, the more you lost."</p>
        <p>The fact is that even before Mr. Krugman rolled his grenade under the tent, the Republicans had recognized inequality as a potential political bombshell and had attempted to defuse it. Two out of nine chapters in this year's Economic Report of the President, for example, tackled the touchy topic.</p>
        <p>Though the report acknowledges that the well-off gained more than anyone else, that poverty was higher in 1989 than in 1979, and that the income prospects of families headed by younger and less-educated workers were dismal, its main emphasis is on overall growth, rather than on how much more some benefited than others.</p>
        <p>"It's much more important for economic policy to promote growth in family incomes than to redistribute it," Mr. Boskin said.</p>
        <p>But some conservatives are fuming because of what they see as the White House's wimpishness on this issue. "The White House is terribly ill suited to take this issue on," said a Republican aide who spoke on the condition that he not be named. "Who's going to fight the fight over fairness? Nicholas Brady? Robert Mossbacher? George Bush? Dan Quayle? There's no one there who comes from the middle class."</p>
        <p>And some Republicans are upset by the notion that some folks at the top got there not by hard work, entrepreneurship or even luck, but by pure thievery, often at the expense of middle-class consumers or taxpayers.</p>
        <p>"Voters are less happy with the people at the top," said Kevin P. Phillips, the political commentator and author of "The Politics of Rich and Poor." "By the end of the 1980's, Horatio Alger got replaced by Charles Keating, Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley."</p>
        <p>And Edward Gillespie, the Republican staff director of the Joint Economic Committee, said: "People are concerned whether their kids can do better than they did. When the economy is stagnating and middle-class workers are losing jobs, it's easier to stoke the class war."</p>
        <p>But Richard B. Freeman, an economist at Harvard University, said, "If everybody had done better -- even if Donald Trump had gotten three times wealthier -- we wouldn't be worrying about inequality."</p>
