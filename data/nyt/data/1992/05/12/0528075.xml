        <p>IN the first major international accord to save dolphins, 10 nations that fish for tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean have agreed to cut the killing of dolphins by 80 percent during the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The agreement, negotiated by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission in late April, builds on an earlier 80 percent drop in dolphin kills, achieved from 1986 to 1991.</p>
        <p>"The resolution sets into motion a program to reduce dolphin mortality to insignificant levels, to levels approaching zero," Dr. James Joseph, director of the commission, said in a telephone interview from his office in La Jolla, Calif. Dolphins, which breathe air, drown when large purse seine nets used to catch tuna close over their heads.</p>
        <p>Under the accord, the number of dolphins killed by tuna fishing would fall below 5,000 by 1999 from the 1991 level of 25,000. The program calls for $4 million to be spent on scientific research projects to help tuna boats catch tuna without killing dolphins.</p>
        <p>The resolution, which is to be formally ratified in June, was reached in La Jolla by representatives of governments that account for 99 percent of the tuna catch in the eastern Pacific: Costa Rica, France, Japan, Nicaragua, Mexico, Panama, Spain, the United States, Venezuela and Vanuatu, formerly New Hebrides.</p>
        <p>One environmental group denounced the accord as too little, too late.</p>
        <p>"The reduction is way too little, and the killing of dolphins will continue way too long," said David C. Phillips, executive director of the Earth Island Institute of San Francisco. "In the United States, consumers, companies and Congress are saying: eliminate the setting of nets on dolphins. Plan for Inspections</p>
        <p>"We do not believe that you can chase down and encircle 1,000 dolphins in a mile-long net and avoid killing them," said Mr. Phillips, whose court action led to a United States embargo on tuna imports from Mexico and Venezuela.</p>
        <p>But Richard C. Atchison, executive director of the American Tunaboat Association, hailed the accord as "reasonable, practical and achievable."</p>
        <p>Mexico and Venezuela, hurt by bad publicity and by dropping exports, are joining the Inter-American Commission and have opened their tuna fleets to inspection by commission observers. Mexico has pledged $1 million for scientific research and Venezuela has pledged $500,000.</p>
        <p>Mexico and Venezuela refuse to release estimates of the number of dolphins killed by their tuna fleets. But commission reports show the two countries had the largest fleets that set tuna nets on dolphins in the eastern Pacific last year. Mexico had 43 boats, Venezuela 21, the United States 13, Vanuatu 10 and Ecuador 8. Tuna boats from the United States, the only nation to release a national estimate, killed about 1,000 dolphins last year.</p>
        <p>To reduce the annual kills, member countries are expected to adopt a system of individual vessel quotas next month. Under the system, an independent onboard observer would inform a tuna captain when he had reached his vessel quota. Captains who continue fishing would be subject to fines or license suspensions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joseph, an American marine biologist, said he believed the research would help save dolphins, sea mammals that enjoy a reputation for intelligence and friendliness.</p>
        <p>Most of the world's dolphin kills occur in the eastern Pacific, where adult yellowfin tuna tend to congregate below dolphin schools. To avoid killing dolphins, some tuna boats have started harvesting juvenile tuna. But, if maintained, this technique could cut tuna stocks in half by the end of the decade. In contrast, there are an estimated eight million dolphins in the Pacific, and the population is not endangered.</p>
        <p>In one study, scientists will research why and when adult tuna associate with dolphins. By attaching radio transmitters to dolphins and to tuna, they will be able to detect when the two species separate.</p>
        <p>"If we understand why they associate, maybe we can break the bond at the strategic time," said Dr. Joseph. "If the bond weakens at night, maybe we can catch tuna at night."</p>
        <p>Scientists will also try to attract adult tuna with dummy dolphin schools. Early experiments with floating oil drums and logs fitted with radio transmitters only attracted juvenile tuna about one-fifth the weight of adult tuna. Use of Laser Beams</p>
        <p>Attempting to use laser beams to locate adult tuna schools, commission scientists plan to experiment with a system known as Lidar, for airborne light-detecting and ranging device.</p>
        <p>In a different approach, engineers will study the dynamics of wind and currents on mammoth purse seine nets used by large tuna boats. After setting one of these nets around schools of dolphins and tuna, a tuna boat closes the bottom by winching a steel cable through a series of rings. Then, other cables tighten the walls of the "purse." A second net is used to scoop tuna out of the purse seine.</p>
        <p>But winds and currents often draw together top portions of the net, trapping dolphins below and causing them to drown.</p>
