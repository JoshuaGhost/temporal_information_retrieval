        <p>CONSERVATIONISTS who put up birdhouses to help wild wood ducks breed may instead be harming the elegantly patterned ducks' reproductive efforts by choosing the wrong locations, biologists say.</p>
        <p>About 90,000 of the sturdy artificial nests have been placed in national refuges as well as on state and private lands around the country. And every year, conservationists and wildlife managers put up more, typically in clusters on poles in lakes or ponds, where they are safe from raccoons and other predators, and managers can clean them all at once.</p>

        <p>CONSERVATIONISTS who put up birdhouses to help wild wood ducks breed may instead be harming the elegantly patterned ducks' reproductive efforts by choosing the wrong locations, biologists say.</p>
        <p>About 90,000 of the sturdy artificial nests have been placed in national refuges as well as on state and private lands around the country. And every year, conservationists and wildlife managers put up more, typically in clusters on poles in lakes or ponds, where they are safe from raccoons and other predators, and managers can clean them all at once.</p>
        <p>"It's not just Government wildlife managers that are putting out these boxes," said Dr. Paul Sherman, a behavioral biologist at Cornell University who has studied the ducks. "The Boy Scouts, Ducks Unlimited, the Kiwanis -- they put out thousands of these boxes every year."</p>
        <p>The problem arises from the tree-loving ducks' habit of "egg dumping." Females will sneak a few eggs in here and there in the nests of other females who expend time and energy caring for the other duck's young as well as their own. The researchers recently discovered that the cue a parasitizing female uses to begin her egg dumping is the sight of another female entering her nest.</p>
        <p>Under natural conditions these wood ducks nest in well-hidden tree holes rather than in highly visible nest boxes, keeping egg dumping under control.</p>
        <p>But researchers hoping to study the natural egg dumping behavior of breeding females found that in the highly visible nest boxes there was far more dumping than is seen under natural nesting conditions. Nests that normally had 10 to 13 eggs would be jammed with as many as 30 to 40 eggs, a crushing layer sometimes six inches thick. Eggs were being broken, starting infections that sometimes spread, killing all the other eggs in the nest. Even in broods that survived infection, many eggs were hidden under so many others that the embryos died for lack of warmth.</p>
        <p>The researchers observed that when a nesting female would fly into her box, easily visible in the open, five or six females would sometimes follow and try to force their way in.</p>
        <p>The biologists saw even more bizarre behaviors. "The females are fighting over boxes sometimes to the death," said Dr. Sherman. "When the nesting female gets in and tries to keep out the others, they push females out. These parasitizing females are primed to lay their egg. They have an egg in the oviduct and they end up laying them anywhere: on stumps, on top of boxes, in the water."</p>
        <p>But the solution is simple: armed with the new knowledge of the birds' natural behavior, conservationists can hide their nest boxes in the woods, making them difficult for other birds to see.</p>
