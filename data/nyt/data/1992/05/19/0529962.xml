        <p>Looking to reinforce a prime-time schedule depleted by the departure of "The Cosby Show" and four other longtime hits, NBC announced a fall lineup yesterday that will introduce eight new series: five comedies, two dramas and one "reality" show.</p>
        <p>NBC is also moving six series to different time periods and making changes on every night but Monday.</p>
        <p>One new comedy will bring back Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who starred as Theo on "Cosby"; two will star stand-up comedians, Paul Reiser and Roger Kabler, and another will star the singer Patti LaBelle.</p>
        <p>The dramas come from the producers responsible for "Beverly Hills 90210" on Fox and "Top Cops" on CBS. NBC is also bringing back two dramas considered to be close calls for renewal, "I'll Fly Away" and "Reasonable Doubts."</p>
        <p>Among the shows the network is canceling: "Hot Country Nights," "Nightmare Cafe," "The Torkelsons" and "Eerie, Indiana." In addition to "Cosby," "Night Court," "Golden Girls," "Matlock" and "In the Heat of the Night" all finished their runs on NBC this season, though the last three will turn up on different networks next season. A Young Manhattan Couple</p>
        <p>NBC is giving its most promising comedy slot, at 9:30 on Wednesday, after "Seinfeld," to Mr. Reiser's show, called "Loved by You." In it, he and Helen Hunt play a young married couple trying to deal with the demands of their professional lives in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner's comedy, "Here and Now," about a graduate student in psychology working at a youth center for disadvantaged children, will replace "Golden Girls" on Saturday nights at 8.</p>
        <p>It will be followed at 8:30 by "Up All Night," in which Ms. LaBelle plays the owner of a dance club who hires a young man as manager and takes him under her wing.</p>
        <p>In a slightly recast Thursday night, "A Different World" will be moved to 8 P.M., the old "Cosby" spot, to be followed by a new comedy, "Rhythm and Blues." The new show stars Mr. Kabler as a white disk jockey hired at an all-black station in Detroit.</p>
        <p>The other comedy, set for Friday night at 8, is "In the Loop," about two former high school football buddies from Chicago. One owns a gas station mini-mart and the other is newly out of prison. Hanging Out in Georgetown</p>
        <p>The drama from the makers of "Beverly Hills 90210" is "The Roundtable," on Fridays at 9. Set in Washington, it concerns a group of young professionals in law and law enforcement, all of whom hang out at the same Georgetown bar.</p>
        <p>The network, which has had enduring problems on Sundays at 7, will try again with "Secret Service," a new series from the makers of "Top Cops," which will recreate events from the files of that arm of the Government.</p>
        <p>The "reality" series, based on events from real life placed in an entertainment format, is not entirely new. "I Witness Video," which presents camcorder coverage of events, mostly crimes and natural disasters, has played several times as a special this season. It will become the regular entry Sunday night at 8.</p>
        <p>In addition to "A Different World," NBC is moving five other series. "Quantum Leap" moves from Wednesday at 10 to Tuesday at 8. "Reasonable Doubts" moves from Friday at 9 to Tuesday at 9. "Law and Order" moves from Tuesday at 9 to Wednesday at 10. "The Powers That Be," Norman Lear's latest series, moves from Saturday at 8:30 to Friday at 8:30. And "I'll Fly Away" moves from Friday at 8 to Friday at 10.</p>
