        <p>Alexander R. Mottola, a retired businessman and longtime president of the Polar Bear Club, died on Saturday at Staten Island University Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>He died of cancer, his family said.</p>
        <p>For 27 years, Mr. Mottola led the Polar Bears, the intrepid men and women who met every Sunday to plunge in the Coney Island surf, even in the depth of winter, with water temperatures as low as 30 degrees. For a beer commercial, he performed this feat in December in a Minnesota lake, where the air temperature was 25 degrees below zero and workers chopped through ice to reach the water, his wife, Irene, said.</p>
