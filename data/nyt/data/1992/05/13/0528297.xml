        <p>Producer prices crept up a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Government said today. Economists said the report showed that the Federal Reserve had room to cut interest rates again to perk up the slowly recovering economy.</p>
        <p>The Producer Price Index, which also went up by two-tenths of 1 percent in March and in February, has risen so far this year at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent, the Labor Department said.</p>
        <p>"One reason the inflation rate is so low is the sluggish economy," said Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a banking company in Minneapolis. "I think the Fed will recognize this and take appropriate action as soon as possible."  Consumer Data Due Today</p>
        <p>Analysts predict the Fed will wait to act until it sees if the low inflation figures are confirmed by the Consumer Price Index, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday.</p>
        <p>"We will see further progress in reducing inflation in the C.P.I.," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
        <p>That would ease any fears that another move to cut interest rates, which have been coming down steadily for more than a year, would overheat the economy and stoke inflation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sohn contends the central bank should be aggressive and move for cuts of half a percentage point in both the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for loans, and the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks for loans.</p>
        <p>Many economists maintain that such a move by the Fed would persuade banks to cut their prime lending rates by half a point. Many business and consumer loans are pegged to the prime.</p>
        <p>Most banks' prime rates are at 6 1/2 percent, although Chemical Bank in New York, the nation's fourth-largest, cut its rate to 6 1/4 percent after the Fed's most recent push, on April 9, to lower the Federal funds rate to 3 3/4 percent from 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said the core rate of wholesale inflation, which excludes the volatile prices of food and energy, also rose by two-tenths of 1 percent in April. Goods at the intermediate level rose one-tenth of 1 percent, and crude prices were up three-tenths.</p>
        <p>Wholesale food prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April after dropping five-tenths in March. Energy prices advanced by five-tenths last month, mainly because of increases in the price of refined oil products; they had shot up 1.2 percent in March.  Some economists expressed concern about the rise in energy prices.</p>
        <p>"It's a good number," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University, referring to the overall index. "But there are some special circumstances."  Gasoline and Heating Oil</p>
        <p>He noted that gasoline prices rose by 1.4 percent last month, after gaining 1.1 percent in March. Heating oil was up 4.6 percent in April, after advancing two-tenths of 1 percent in March and 16.2 percent in February.</p>
        <p>But other economists said the rise in energy prices should not deter Fed policy makers from easing credit.</p>
        <p>"Energy is clearly not something that can be rectified by monetary policy, and they should not be concerned about it," said Mr. Gramley, a former Fed board member.</p>
        <p>Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, said he thought the Fed was prepared to lower interest rates if inflation remained under control and the recovery appeared to falter.  Bond Prices Head Up</p>
        <p>"They have the opportunity and the will to do something extra if necessary," Mr. Boskin told reporters in Paris, where he was at a meeting.</p>
        <p>Inflation-sensitive Treasury bond prices surged on the producer prices report, with the 30-year issue up more than half a point, cutting its yield to 7.86 percent, from 7.88 percent Monday. Stock prices fell, however, as investors awaited the consumer price report on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Recent data show that business activity is gradually picking up speed, which would traditionally argue for the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee to hold the line on interest rates. The committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But economists said the Fed needed to insure that the recovery took hold and did not falter, as it did last year. They added that the tepid 2 percent annual rate of economic growth recorded in the first quarter was not enough to accomplish that.</p>
