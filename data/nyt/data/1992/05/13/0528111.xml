        <p>Citicorp yesterday proposed a $400 million recapitalization intended to save it $33.5 million a year in preferred stock dividends. But Wall Street traders immediately placed bets that the nation's largest bank holding company would be forced to sweeten the deal to win acceptance by holders of its preferred stock.</p>
        <p>Citicorp offered to issue as many as 21.1 million common shares, worth $396 million at yesterday's closing price, in exchange for two series of preferred shares.</p>

        <p>Citicorp yesterday proposed a $400 million recapitalization intended to save it $33.5 million a year in preferred stock dividends. But Wall Street traders immediately placed bets that the nation's largest bank holding company would be forced to sweeten the deal to win acceptance by holders of its preferred stock.</p>
        <p>Citicorp offered to issue as many as 21.1 million common shares, worth $396 million at yesterday's closing price, in exchange for two series of preferred shares.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the announcement sent the price of Citicorp's common stock down 75 cents, to $18.75, but drove up the prices of the preferred issues amid speculation that Citicorp would raise its offer.</p>
        <p>Citicorp said the exchange offer would provide both a premium to market price for its preferred holders and an improvement in its capital position. That is because Citicorp will be exchanging preferred stock with a book value of $540 million for common now worth 27 percent less.</p>
        <p>But the move could prove costly in the long run for the bank. While the exhange deal would save the $33.5 million in dividends Citicorp is now paying on the preferred shares, the new common shares being offered would pay $37.6 million in annual dividends if and when Citicorp returns its dividend to the level being paid in 1990. The company first reduced and later eliminated the payout, as its financial problems increased.</p>
        <p>If all holders of the preferred shares accept the offer, it will increase the number of common shares outstanding by 6 percent, to about 373 million. And if Citicorp were to sweeten the offer, the number of shares being issued would rise.</p>
        <p>Asked about a possible better offer, Jack Morris, a Citicorp spokesman, said: "We feel the exchange offers are fair and appropriate. We have no present intention to change the terms."</p>
        <p>While Citicorp still has substantial problems with real estate loans, shareholders have grown more confident that the bank will get through its difficulties. The shares are trading at more than twice the low they reached in December.</p>
        <p>The two preferred issues are adjustable-rate securities brought out in 1983 when banks were considered much better credit risks than they are now. Those preferreds have interest rates that were supposed to vary with market interest rates, assuring that each issue would trade approximately at the par value of $100 a share. But with banks having run into credit problems, the preferreds have traded well below par. They are formally known as Citi's second and third issues of adjustable-rate preferred. Big Gains for Preferred Shares</p>
        <p>On the Big Board yesterday, the second series of preferred rose $3.75, to $71. Citi offered 3.72 shares of common for each share of that issue, worth $69.75 at yesterday's closing price.</p>
        <p>The third series of preferred, for which Citi is offering 4.40 shares of common for each share, worth $82.50 at yesterday's closing price, rose $3.75, to $83.25.</p>
        <p>The preferred issues now pay a total of $33.5 million in annual dividends. Under their terms, they could pay as much as $64.8 million if market interest rates rose sharply. The rates on the second issue vary from 6 percent to 12 percent, and on the third from 7 percent to 12 percent.</p>
        <p>Citicorp paid a quarterly dividend on its common stock of 44.5 cents a share until it was cut to 25 cents on Dec. 18, 1990, and then eliminated on Oct. 15 of last year.</p>
