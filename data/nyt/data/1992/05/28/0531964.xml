        <p>LOOKING FOR TOMORROW'S BETTORS</p>
        <p>The generation of bettors who regularly visit tracks is aging, and track operators say too few young horse players are showing up to take their places along the rail. B6. NEW YORK CITY  MANAGEMENT BY MURDER</p>
        <p>Testifying about how a New York-based crime organization often used murder as a managerial technique, its former boss described in brutal detail the extent to which the crime family would go to terminally silence "rats" and rivals within its ranks. A1. A VETO FOR CARRIAGE BILL</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins promised to veto a bill allowing horse-drawn carriages to operate outside Central Park in much of mid-Manhattan, setting the stage for a fight to override his decision by the City Council. B3. THE WEAPONS OF WHOSE CHOICE?</p>
        <p>New York City's Police Commissioner urged state legislators to reject a bill that would require city police officers to carry semiautomatic weapons instead of service revolvers, saying that the Legislature had no business telling the Police Department what weapons to use. B3. EX-AIDE TO DINKINS PLEADS GUILTY</p>
        <p>Arnold I. Biegen, the former finance chairman of Dinkins's 1989 mayoral campaign, pleaded guilty to charges of evading income taxes on more than $1 million he had earlier admitted embezzling from a Brooklyn widow and the Dinkins campaign. B3. AN EVER-EVOLVING BUDGET</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins held firm to his administration's estimate of the size of the city budget surplus. But he also seemed to open the door slightly to possible revisions before the jousting with the City Council is completed next month. B3.  Police officers shoot a Brooklyn man in his home. B2. REGION  GUILTY VERDICT IN WARMUS CASE</p>
        <p>Carolyn Warmus, portrayed by prosecutors as obsessed with a married man, was convicted of killing her lover's wife. It was the second time Ms. Warmus had been tried in the case, which described betrayals and deceptions behind the scenes in mundane suburban settings. A1. NEW JERSEY HEALTH SYSTEM OVERTURNED</p>
        <p>A Federal judge ruled that New Jersey could not enforce its system of paying the hospital bills of the poor by increasing the bills of workers covered by self-supporting union health plans. A1.  SCRAMBLING ON THE CLINTON BANDWAGON</p>
        <p>New Jersey's Democratic political establishment was slow in climbing aboard the Bill Clinton bandwagon and now the party is struggling to make up for lost time. A21. A CHOICE FOR CONGRESS</p>
        <p>In a New Jersey district where winning the Democratic primary has been tantamount to winning the general election, voters in next week's primary will choose between a candidate bidding to become the state's first Hispanic congressman and another who is bent on dismantling a political machine that once commanded national prominence.
