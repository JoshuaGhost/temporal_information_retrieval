        <p>At least 16 people have been killed and many others wounded in the most violent week this city has experienced since the overthrow in September of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
        <p>Nighttime shootings involving uniformed soldiers and groups of marauding, heavily armed men have become commonplace from the low-lying, muddy neighborhoods of the poor to wealthier areas that dominate the hillsides of the capital, according to residents, diplomats and human-rights workers.</p>
        <p>The most prominent victim of the recent wave of attacks was Georges Izmery, a wealthy Haitian merchant who is the brother of one of President Aristide's closest and most outspoken supporters remaining in the country. Mr. Izmery was killed by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>In another incident, soldiers guarding the airport today briefly detained Evans Paul, Mayor of Port-au-Prince and one of the military's staunchest critics, as he attempted to leave the country for Brazil. He was reportedly released when Canadian diplomats intervened to escort him to safety.</p>
        <p>Many Haitians say incidents like those, which human-rights experts say have sent hundreds of people into hiding across the country, reflect the growing insecurity of the military-backed Government, which is squeezed by an international trade embargo and rising resistance from Father Aristide's partisans and other dissenters. Killings and U.S. Policy</p>
        <p>"There has been a tremendous increase in this kind of violence in the last couple of weeks," said a conservative businessman with close ties to the United States. "Last night, you could hear the shooting in my neighborhood. People are being terrorized, and a bunch of people are being killed."</p>
        <p>The death-squad-style killing of Mr. Izmery took place as he closed his business, which is only a few yards from the headquarters of this city's powerful and much feared downtown military police detachment.</p>
        <p>Citing the close relationship between Father Aristide and the slain man's brother, Antoine, and his recent calls for more active resistance, diplomats say people with close links to the military, if not soldiers, must be considered prime suspects.</p>
        <p>The spate of violence has coincided with the Bush Administration's decision to directly repatriate Haitians trying to enter the United States illegally aboard small boats. Thirty-four thousand Haitians are estimated to have sought to reach the United States in that way since the overthrow of Father Aristide in September, but until this week the Coast Guard took the intercepted Haitians to a camp at Guantanamo, Cuba, where they had the opportunity to apply for legal asylum in the United States. Evidence and Persecution</p>
        <p>Human-rights campaigners, who have strenuously condemned Washington's decision, said that by denying any way out of the country, the policy would assure greater strife.</p>
        <p>"This would almost seem what the policy intended," said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a leading Haitian human-rights worker.</p>
        <p>In support of the Bush Administration's new repatriation policy, which instructs Haitians to pursue their asylum claims through the offices of the United States Embassy here, diplomats have insisted that there is no evidence that any of the thousands of Haitians who have already been returned by the Coast Guard have suffered persecution.</p>
        <p>Moreover, they say, only a tiny minority of the boat people have legitimate political justification for seeking refuge in the United States.</p>
        <p>"We have never argued that people don't experience fear here," said a diplomat. "There is little you can do about that. But that standard is not enough to make you a refugee. We are not living in anything like a Guatemala or an El Salvador."</p>
        <p>But human-rights experts point to the killing of Georges Izmery as an example of the military's increasing reliance on harsh repressive measures.</p>
        <p>The killing took place a day after Antoine Izmery denounced the United States' diplomatic initiatives on Father Aristide's behalf as "wasting time deliberately" and declared in an interview that the deposed President could only be restored "with a popular movement getting rid of the army, or a blowup in the army itself."</p>
        <p>Reacting to news of the Izmery killing, Renaud Bernadin, a minister in Father Aristide's Government who has remained in hiding in Haiti, said the army had "signed its own death warrant in blood" and promised a "fight to the finish."</p>
        <p>Some diplomats here, who insisted on not being further identified, said they feared that with no solution to the country's political crisis in view, Haiti may be heading toward open civil conflict on a broad scale.</p>
        <p>"In my mind, this thing is not going to end well," said one official. "This place is like a powder keg and people are armed to the teeth. It might not come this week or next, but there is going to be more bloodshed here, and I am afraid there'll be a lot of it." Signs of Army Discord</p>
        <p>Even more worrisome for the army, a group of soldiers broadcast a message on a radio station on Monday criticizing the military leadership for its involvement in politics and demanding elections for a new government.</p>
        <p>Although those soldiers openly rejected the return of Father Aristide, people familiar with the military say there are signs that other groups of enlisted men may be organizing to demand the deposed leader's restoration.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 days, at least 11 soldiers have been killed. Observers of the military say that at least five of them were killed by fellow soldiers, possibly reflecting growing political cleavages in the army.</p>
