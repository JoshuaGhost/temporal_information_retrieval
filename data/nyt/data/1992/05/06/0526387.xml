        <p>THE Mercedes came tooling down Michigan Avenue. It swerved to the curb and a white woman in her 30's poked her head out the passenger side window.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Terkel," she called. "Oh, Mr. Terkel! We read your book. We loved it! Thank you so much."</p>

        <p>THE Mercedes came tooling down Michigan Avenue. It swerved to the curb and a white woman in her 30's poked her head out the passenger side window.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Terkel," she called. "Oh, Mr. Terkel! We read your book. We loved it! Thank you so much."</p>
        <p>The little guy on the sidewalk smiled and gave a sort of half bow as the car drove off.</p>
        <p>Two blocks farther along, a young black bicycle messenger was waiting for a traffic light to change. He saw the little guy and his eyes lit up.</p>
        <p>"Hey," he said. "Hey, Studs. I got your book. I'm going to read it, man." The book is "Race: How Blacks and Whites Think and Feel about the American Obsession" (New Press, 1992).</p>
        <p>And so it went: a fellow on the bridge over the river, the clerks in the cigar store, the man at the dry cleaners. "Hello Mr. Terkel." "Hey, Studs."</p>
        <p>Was there anything unusual in all this, the little guy was asked.</p>
        <p>"Nah, everyone around here knows me, that's all."</p>
        <p>Everybody in Chicago?</p>
        <p>Studs Terkel was on his way to lunch at Riccardo's, an old hangout about a 20-minute walk from his office on East Wacker Drive.</p>
        <p>"This used to be a newspaper joint," he said as he entered. No more. Solid business types filled the room and lounged at the bar.</p>
        <p>"Isn't that. . . .?" began one tie-and-vest at the bar.</p>
        <p>"Yes," said his companion, "it is."</p>
        <p>"Have the whitefish," Studs said. "It's my favorite here." He had the whitefish. Also a martini on the rocks and a couple of glasses of red wine.</p>
        <p>Riccardo's -- and the whitefish -- unleashed a flood of reminiscence. "There were a dozen papers once. Everyone turned up at the bar. Algren and I used to sit right over there," he said. "Sometimes Mauldin would join us.</p>
        <p>"There really was a Riccardo. He looked like Don Giovanni. No, he looked liked Ezio Pinza in 'Don Giovanni.' They had singing waiters in those days, and Riccardo would join right in. He'd walk around doing 'Di Provenza il mar' from 'Traviata'."</p>
        <p>But times had changed. "I come in with Royko once in a while," he said, "or Bill Newman from The Sun-Times, but that's it. My luncheon companions -- two guys. And even Royko is from a younger generation. I go by wars: he's Korea, I was World War II."</p>
        <p>Studs was content. And a little sad. Riccardo's is changing hands soon. "Going upscale," he said. In the Terkel lexicon, upscale is not positive.</p>
        <p>Studs Terkel is 80 years old, and there are those who would say he is at the pinnacle of his career. "Race" has received immense critical acclaim. It also made him the commentator of the hour last week, appearing as it presciently did just six weeks before the Rodney G. King verdict and the riots that followed it. His radio interview program, now in its fourth decade, is more popular than ever and he has enough projects to keep him busy past his centenary.</p>
        <p>"Retire?" he said. "Never. I'm going out toes up."</p>
        <p>He is short, about 5 feet 5, and walks with a slouch that makes him look even shorter. His uniform -- he rarely varies it -- consists of rumpled slacks, a blue blazer over an open-necked red-checked shirt and a fire-engine red sweater with socks to match. His thinning hair, once black, is almost blond. He combs it by running his fingers through it from time to time.</p>
        <p>"When you get older, your frame of reference doesn't work anymore," he said. "I remember the '48 Henry Wallace campaign. I remember Martin, Barton and Fish. But it's not just me. We're a country with no revered past, no yesterday. It's like a national Alzheimer's. There's a guy with the Mets, Vince Coleman, who says he never heard of Jackie Robinson."</p>
        <p>The conversation ranges. "You know Harold Washington read books? Can you imagine a Mayor of Chicago who read books?</p>
        <p>"I've got this hearing aid. Ronnie Reagan has two. Of course, there's nothing in between his."</p>
        <p>But always it comes back to Chicago and to his idol Nelson Algren.</p>
        <p>"Algren used to say. . . ."</p>
        <p>"I remember one time in Paris with Algren and de Beauvoir. . . ."</p>
        <p>Why Nelson Algren? Studs invokes Algren's 1951 "Chicago, City on the Make," a bittersweet paean to a tough town. "He was lyrical, he was funny and he was always looking for a way to cheat the big boys," he said.</p>
        <p>But Algren's love affair with Chicago soured and he ended up in a grave in Sag Harbor, L.I. What about that? "Yeah, he moved away," Studs said, "but read the quote from Baudelaire that he used for his introduction."</p>
        <p>Baudelaire wrote: "I love the infamous city."</p>
        <p>Studs Terkel, Mr. Chicago to many, was born in the Bronx, near Crotona Park. The family moved to Chicago in 1920, when he was 8. His father, Sam, was ill much of his life and his mother, Annie, ran a boardinghouse and then a men's hotel in the heart of the Loop. "She was a tough little sparrow," he said.</p>
        <p>On the way to Riccardo's he paused to stare up at his old home, the Wells Grand Hotel. "It was a wonderful place," he said. "We had mostly transients: journeymen, railroad firemen, old Wobblies, really colorful people. I'm glad some poor folks are living there now.</p>
        <p>"For a kid, the neighborhood was fantastic. The museums were around the corner; so were the theaters. I saw everything from low vaudeville to Walter Hampden as Cyrano de Bergerac. I was in love with the stage."</p>
        <p>Studs graduated from the University of Chicago in 1932 with a degree in philosophy and from the Chicago Law School in 1934. After six months in Washington as a Government lawyer, he fled back to Chicago. In 1939 he married Ida Goldberg. They have a son, Paul, a city planner.</p>
        <p>"I did everything," Studs said. "I acted in soap operas. I was usually a gangster, which meant about three weeks' work because I'd get shot. I was on the stage for a while.</p>
        <p>"I drifted into being a disk jockey. I played jazz, folk music, opera. I'd follow Burl Ives with a 1915 Emma Calve recording of the 'Habanera' from 'Carmen.' "</p>
        <p>Playing records led to interviewing the artists, which led to a television talk show, "Studs Place," in TV's earliest days. His given name was Louis; he took "Studs" from Studs Lonigan, the anti-hero created by another Chicago writer, James T. Farrell. "In those days, I usually had a Lonigan book in my pocket," he said.</p>
        <p>"It was John Crosby, writing in the old Herald-Tribune who gave me my first break," he said. "It was 1950 and he flipped over Chicago television -- Dave Garroway, Fran Allison with 'Kukla, Fran and Ollie,' and me."</p>
        <p>He smiled at the memory, swirled his martini and continued. "I got picked up by NBC, but the next thing I know I'm knocked out of the box. Those were the McCarthy days and, well, I'm something of a loudmouth. I'm chairing rallies and signing petitions, some of them -- a lot of them -- initiated by Communists.</p>
        <p>"Then Ed Sullivan carried an item in his column that said Studs Terkel was going to be dropped by NBC for having Harry Belafonte on his show. And I was."</p>
        <p>That was 1953. He returned to radio, to station WFMT-FM in Chicago. He is still there, doing a one-hour broadcast five days a week that is "intermittently" rebroadcast by some 40 Public Broadcasting Service stations. His tiny office overflows with books, manuscripts, records, tapes and unanswered correspondence. Thousands of other Terkel tapes, an audio history of the years since World War II, are stored in the station's library.</p>
        <p>A printed collection of several of the radio programs prompted Andre Schiffrin, then with Pantheon Books, to nudge Studs into a succession of popular and respected books, including "Hard Times" in 1970, about the Depression; "The Good War," about World War II and "Talking to Myself," a memoir of his first 60 years.</p>
        <p>"Race," like the earlier books, is an exercise in oral history. Each interview is transcribed, usually into about 60 pages of text, then edited.  "It's like prospecting," he said. "The transcripts are the ore. I've got to get to the gold dust. It's got to be the person's truth, highlighted. It's not just putting down what people say."</p>
        <p>His favorite interviewee in the new book? "Probably C. P. Ellis, the former Klansman." In the 1970's, C. P. Ellis was the Exalted Cyclops of the Klan chapter in Durham, N.C. By a fluke, he was named to a community-relations board and had to deal with blacks for the first time in his life. Astonishingly, he became a successful community activist and a champion of civil rights for blacks.</p>
        <p>And the others? "Big Bill Broonzy, the blues singer; Bertrand Russell; Peggy Terry, an Appalachian woman I first interviewed in 1970, then 20 years later; and of course, Lotte Lehmann, the great singer. She was my North Star. She never retired; neither will I."</p>
        <p>His next book, Studs Terkel said, will be about elderly people who still make a difference in their communities. "There are a lot of wonderful, feisty old people around," he said. "They can be tough, they can be effective, they can make a dent. They don't care, they have no more ties.</p>
        <p>"When I think of them, I think of the old Kris Kristofferson line, 'Freedom's just another word for nothing else to lose.' "</p>
        <p>But that's in the future. Back in the office there are shows to prepare, with Peter Ustinov, with the authors William Kennedy and Carlos Fuentes. "I wonder if I can find some 17th-century court music of Spain to do with Fuentes?" he said.</p>
        <p>"And then the books," he said. "Got to read the books. Can't read the flyleaf and wing it like some of these clowns."</p>
