        <p>You park your car next to Hermann Goering's old Air Ministry and walk down toward Hitler's wrecked bunker. You are about a block from a scar of a landscape where, up until two years ago, the Berlin Wall stood.</p>
        <p>Running from the K.G.B.? On the trail of George Smiley? No, just looking for a good time in Berlin.</p>
        <p>A big, disorderly place, Berlin is at ease behaving in a big, disorderly way. The strain comes when Berlin has to quiet down, put on a tie and walk a straight line. Which is probably why Berlin feels so comfortable these days swaying after midnight to the jackhammer beat of techno music at Tresor, a club whose name translates from the German as "strongbox." It opened about a year ago in the derelict safe, as big as a hall, in what before World War II had been Berlin's largest department store, Wertheim, until Allied bombers reduced the size of everything.</p>
        <p>What happened was that, with the opening of the Berlin Wall, surging real-estate prices in the West's Kreuzberg district drove squatters and other young people into the dingy tenements and disused office buildings along the dimly lighted streets of the formerly Communist half of the city. The derelict Wertheim building along Leipziger Strasse, which the Communists used after the war to sell luxury goods to Western diplomats for dollars, seemed a great place for a party.</p>
        <p>Enter Dimitri Hegemann, a 36-year-old West Berlin club owner, and two partners, one from the West and the other from the East.</p>
        <p>After painting the upstairs black and installing a bar, they poked around behind old doors walled up after the war and discovered stairs to an underground safe for Wertheim's credit division: a cavernous area subdivided by heavy steel bars and lined with the rusting remains of old safe-deposit boxes.</p>
        <p>Here, in air blended of acrid mold, cigarette smoke, beer and sweat, every weekend perhaps 800 Berliners, ranging in age from 18 to 40, now dance through the night and well into the following morning under fusillades of strobe lights.</p>
        <p>Dress is important. A 12-year-old who arrived with his 40-ish father on a recent Friday night got it right: a loose-fitting sweatsuit, pink sneakers and a Chicago Bears baseball cap backward on his head.</p>
        <p>Tresor features German disk jockeys who learned their mix from the American house scene in Detroit and Chicago. The sound is computerized, usually the latest underground American hits -- house, hip-hop or techno with a beat like a steady barrage of howitzers.</p>
        <p>The club has its own record label, Tresor, and its own brand of beer, Space, which advertises with the slogan "Have a Good Trip!"</p>
        <p>"The acoustics in here are extraordinary," Mr. Hegemann exults as he leads a visitor into the bowels of the safe. "And the place resonates with history. We're just a couple of hundred yards from Hitler's bunker."</p>
        <p>He points to patched masonry on a wall where overzealous restorers poked through into the subway line under Potsdamer Platz, once the city's Times Square, which now awaits reconstruction after having been destroyed, first by wartime bombing, then by the builders of the Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>But Tresor is one of the phenomena that make the rest of Germany wonder about Berlin. The conservative daily Die Welt, ensconced in its sedate headquarters in sleepy Bonn, carried a review of the club under the headline "The Children of the Bourgeoisie Play the End of the World."</p>
        <p>"That's the way they'd like to be: a little bit anarchic, a little bit illegal, very exclusive," the paper wrote of Tresor's regulars. "Only that exclusivity in Berlin has nothing to do with cocktails and silk ties, but with the sweet fragrance of decadence."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hegemann, sipping Space back in his office, contends that the club has done more than most institutions to bring the once-divided city back together again. His crowd, he said, is roughly divided between prosperous Westerners and impoverished Easterners, people he describes, with tongue in cheek, as "young intelligentsia."</p>
        <p>"When the wall came down, we knew we had to get in here in the center of the city," he said. And he knows, too, that in rapidly changing Berlin the club will probably not live a long life, maybe another year or two. The Federal Property Office, the building's owner, gave him and his partners an open-ended lease, but already reconstruction has begun on Potsdamer Platz, and the building wave that is expected to follow will soon engulf Tresor.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the dancing goes on.</p>
