        <hl1>Ban on Land Mines Is Urgently Needed</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <dateline>To the Editor:
&lt;p&gt;
In "Make a Misstep and You're Dead" (Op-Ed, May 4), Flora Lewis calls on the Japanese Government to take the lead in devising means to clear the millions of land mines strewn around Cambodia and other countries. While it would be wonderful if Japan took on this task, several other countries manufactured the mines and profited from their dissemination. They have a responsibility to lend a hand in removing these indiscriminate weapons.</dateline>

        <p>"Land Mines in Cambodia," an Asia Watch-Physicians for Human Rights report published last September, identified the Cambodia mines and their manufacturers. The countries that principally supplied the combatants were the Soviet Union and Vietnam to the Phnom Penh Government; and the United States, China, Italy, Singapore and India to the Khmer Rouge and the two non-Communist resistance factions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewis refers to some countries where land mines continue to maim and kill large numbers. Among places that belong on that list are Somaliland (the northern half of Somalia, which has declared its independence) and Iraqi Kurdistan generally and not just the border areas. Along with Cambodia, Angola and Afghanistan, these may be considered competitors for the dubious distinction of world land-mine capital. In recent years, they have generated a disproportionate share of the world's refugee population. Land mines make it extremely difficult and dangerous to repatriate these refugees.</p>
        <p>This problem requires an international prohibition on the use of land mines similar to the ban on poison gas that was agreed upon nearly 70 years ago. That will not end their use, but it would stigmatize the users and suppliers, and thereby help to reduce the injuries and deaths from future wars and the wars that land mines continue long after the shooting has ended. ARYEH NEIER Exec. Director, Human Rights Watch Washington, May 5, 1992</p>
