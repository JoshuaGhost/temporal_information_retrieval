        <p>The hatred and homophobia in the Oregon Citizens Alliance's attempt to have homosexuality constitutionally declared "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse," discussed in "Behind the Hate in Oregon" (Op-Ed, Sept. 3), should be a warning call to all Americans. It's time to look at who supports discrimination and encourages violence. Lou Mabon, leader of the Oregon Citizens Alliance, is also a member of the Christian Action Council, and their goals are more expansive than discriminating against lesbians and gay men.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The hatred and homophobia in the Oregon Citizens Alliance's attempt to have homosexuality constitutionally declared "abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse," discussed in "Behind the Hate in Oregon" (Op-Ed, Sept. 3), should be a warning call to all Americans. It's time to look at who supports discrimination and encourages violence. Lou Mabon, leader of the Oregon Citizens Alliance, is also a member of the Christian Action Council, and their goals are more expansive than discriminating against lesbians and gay men.</p>
        <p>The Christian Action Council claims to be the largest antichoice organization in the United States, with more than 500 local chapters dedicated to denying a women her basic reproductive health rights. Their tactics include misrepresentation of facts, intimidation of opponents, censorship and bullying.</p>
        <p>Oregon presents an example of the challenges to liberty all Americans face. Access to health care, adequate funds for children's programs, reality-based sex education and the right to choose are attacked by the same people who systematically target one of our most disenfranchised groups, homosexuals. The time to speak out is now. SALLY J. PATTERSON  New York, Sept. 4, 1992</p>
