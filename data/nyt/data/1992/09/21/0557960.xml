        <p>A quarrel between the United States and Russia, on one side, and Germany, on the other, is snarling efforts of finance ministers here to postpone the repayment of the former Soviet Union's $70 billion foreign debt, senior financial officials here said today.</p>

        <p>A quarrel between the United States and Russia, on one side, and Germany, on the other, is snarling efforts of finance ministers here to postpone the repayment of the former Soviet Union's $70 billion foreign debt, senior financial officials here said today.</p>
        <p>Russian officials, here for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, want to postpone for at least five years their repayments of interest and principal. But German officials are resisting. Half the debt is owed to German banks and German Government agencies, while very little is owed to American banks or Federal agencies here.</p>
        <p>As a result of the quarrel, a comprehensive rescheduling plan that Treasury Department officials seek by the end of this month may not be ready then. But top aides to finance ministers tried and failed to reach an agreement in principle this evening in an effort to settle the issue. The talks will continue through the week. Negotiations Continue</p>
        <p>"That discussion is still going on at the deputies' level, and we will see what sort of flexibility they can apply," Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister David Mazankowski of Canada told reporters late this afternoon.</p>
        <p>The former Soviet Union's foreign debt has been a ghost hanging over the meetings this weekend of finance ministers from the world's wealthiest industrialized nations, who are racing to craft a comprehensive plan for rescheduling its repayment.</p>
        <p>Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin of Russia met with finance ministers from the world's seven richest democracies on Saturday and met today with top American and German officials to seek their help. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said late Saturday that progress had been made towards a rescheduling and that he hoped to have a deal by the end of this month.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brady sounded cautious about the feasibility of the Treasury Department's timetable. "End of the month? That might be a little quick, but that's a goal," Mr. Brady said, noting that the I.M.F. needed to do an extensive analysis of new financial figures recently presented by Russian officials.</p>
        <p>Russia is publicly seeking to postpone repayments for up to 15 years, although Russian officials have privately told Western commercial bankers and Government officials that they would be satisfied with a five-year delay. Western commercial bankers and German officials have been reluctant to countenance any postponement, and want it limited to two years if it is necessary. The United States has sided with Russia on the need for a delay although it has not agreed that five years is necessary.</p>
        <p>Russia is receiving $18 billion in Western financial assistance this year, and will need an equal sum next year, an International Monetary Fund staff member said. Part of that money will consist of new grants, loans and other credits, while the rest will consist of Russia saving money by not paying its debts promptly.</p>
        <p>Because Germany is owed so much of the debt, it has advocated new spending by Western Governments rather than help with the debt. The United States, with few loans outstanding but a huge budget deficit, has taken the opposite approach.</p>
        <p>The Department of Agriculture has guaranteed that it will repay $4.3 billion worth of American and foreign commercial bank loans in the last two years that Russia has spent to buy American wheat. American banks are only owed about $200 million that is not guaranteed by the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>Loans guaranteed by the Agriculture Department are among the very few that Russia has continued to pay, because American law requires that these loans be up to date or that a formal rescheduling be completed before any additional loans can be guaranteed. Commercial banks have refused for the last year to lend any money to the former republics without promises from their own governments that it will be repaid.</p>
        <p>The American insistence has irritated some allies who have not been repaid. Canada, for example, briefly stopped wheat shipments to Russia this summer because some of the loans it had guaranteed were not being repaid. That dispute was quickly patched up and shipments resumed, and Mr. Mazankowski said today that negotiations on this issue continue. Payments Already Late</p>
        <p>Some form of debt rescheduling is inevitable because Russia and the other republics are already behind on servicing their debts with interest and principal repayments, the I.M.F. staff member said.</p>
        <p>"Russia is servicing only a small part, the others are servicing very little -- to that extent, a rescheduling is recognizing reality," the official said.</p>
        <p>Debt negotiations have focused on Russia because it has shown the greatest willingness to shoulder the former Soviet Union's debts, although Russian and Western officials have been pressing other republics to help.</p>
        <p>Russia's debt problems are intertwined with other international financial issues because it is the one area where Germany wants something from other industrialized nations. In the ongoing turmoil among European currencies, Germany is in the dominant position with a strong currency. Other nations are in the difficult position of beseeching German officials to weaken the mark by lowering interest rates. Loans Weaken German Position</p>
        <p>But Germany's large exposure to the Soviet Union has put it in the position of seeking other nations' help on this issue. The prospects for a compromise linking the two issues are dim, however, because they are handled by different groups of officials who are not readily able to work together, an official involved in the issue said.</p>
        <p>The German Bundesbank controls interest rates there, and is almost completely independent of the German Finance Ministry, which is handling the debt issue.</p>
        <p>The seven industrialized democracies gave Russia permission last November to defer some of its interest and principal payments this year, totaling as much as $3 billion, and Russia soon forced its commercial bankers to accept a similar deferral.</p>
        <p>A formal rescheduling that would allow Agriculture Department and other credits to continue would require the approval of the Paris Club, an informal group of creditor governments the composition of which depends on the country seeking rescheduling.</p>
        <p>Last winter's payment deferral infuriated European commercial bankers in particular and has made them especially hostile to a formal rescheduling now. "It would mean that the Paris Club would reschedule in the face of what is very unsatisfactory performance," Horst Schulmann, the managing director of the Institute for International Finance, the lobbying arm of international banks, said before this weekend's meetings began.</p>
