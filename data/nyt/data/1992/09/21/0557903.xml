        <p>The experience of Hurricane Andrew shows how foolish it is -- indeed, how cruel -- to give disaster aid short shrift.</p>
        <p>In years past, Federal disaster aid was directed from an office in the White House and thus commanded more attention throughout the Government. Now it's an underfunded independent agency, overstocked with political appointees.</p>
        <p>But the design of a more effective aid program goes beyond more money and better staff. It reaches to basic questions of authority -- Federal and state, military and civilian.</p>
        <p>The time immediately following a disaster is when help is most urgently needed. By law, however, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can't swing into action until a governor asks it to. Governors, in turn, need time to assess the damage and the capacity of state and local agencies to handle it. They are rightly reluctant to declare martial law and call in Federal troops unless it's really necessary.</p>
        <p>Should Washington be authorized to move relief workers in on its own say-so? Clearly, the Federal Government has more manpower and equipment than any state can possibly maintain. These resources are mostly in the military. Indeed, some argue for putting the Pentagon in charge of the whole program -- planning and preparation as well as aid when disaster strikes.</p>
        <p>Historic American principle says no; local and state authorities are responsible for the welfare of their communities. Federal personnel aren't welcome unless invited, and the use of Federal</p>
        <p>military</p>
        <p>personnel is still touchier. Even when they help only with feeding, housing and cleanup work -- rather than law-and-order jobs -- Federal troops impose military authority over civilian life.</p>
        <p>But it is clear that the system needs an overhaul. Moving emergency management back to the White House would certainly give it more clout, but new legislation would be needed to give Washington more authority over the states.</p>
        <p>For example, the Federal agency needs more power to see that the states prepare themselves, by training state officials more conscientiously and by keeping better track of supplies and equipment.</p>
        <p>And, without trespassing on state authority, Washington could be more helpful at the time of a disaster by assisting state authorities in their damage assessment, thus speeding a governor's call for aid.</p>
        <p>The only time Washington gives much thought to how it copes with these crises is right after one. In between, there always seem to be more important things to think about, like war and peace and interest rates. The result is inadequate response when disaster strikes.</p>
