        <p>Linda Ronstadt's Beginnings</p>
        <p>Linda Ronstadt's transition from big pop star to small pop exoticist has been greeted with both critical abuse and commercial decline. Where Ms. Ronstadt used to have a flourishing pop career, she's now been making records that delve deep into nearly forgotten pop and folk genres, from her album of standards with Nelson Riddle, " 'Round Midnight" (Elektra), to her more recent "Mas Canciones" (Elektra), an album of Mexican folk and mariachi music.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ronstadt, who grew up in Tucson, Ariz., and has a Mexican ancestry, has just released an album, "Frenesi" (Elektra), which tries to revive the glory days of Mexican international pop music. In the 1940's and 50's, Mexican pop, heavily influenced by Cuban music, turned out a set of songs that became standards in Latin America, coinciding with a burst of activity in both the arts and Mexican film.</p>
        <p>"This is the music I would sing a lot in the living room," Ms. Ronstadt said by telephone from Tucson. "A lot of what's on the new record -- 'Quiereme Mucho' is a good example -- my dad and I would sing. And a lot of that music was on the radio. And when we'd go on vacation in Mexico, we heard it there. I'm crazy about it. I can't get enough of it."</p>
        <p>Like Paul Simon and David Byrne, Ms. Ronstadt has been attacked for her lack of authenticity, the idea being that performers have to stick to their background. But Ms. Ronstadt is doing exactly that.</p>
        <p>"Actually, the least authentic stuff I do is rock-and-roll, which I came to late in my life," she said. "I was successful, and I wasn't going to argue about that. The success gave me a platform and I learned something about singing American pop music, which I'm glad to know. Look, I didn't grow up in Tennessee, so Dolly Parton is more of a stranger to me than Mexican singers. The stuff I sing with the most authenticity is the Mexican rancheras, which have always influenced my pop style."</p>
        <p>Oddly, Ms. Ronstadt says she doesn't know much about the source of the music on "Frenesi": Afro-Cuban music and its modern evolution, salsa. She's more interested in the Mexican manifestation of it.</p>
        <p>"I really don't know anything about Cuban music," she said. "I know about the 18th century, that Caribbean mixture out of which so much evolved. Mambos are ideal examples, an absolutely wonderful collusion of taste and sound, a wonderful use of the European orchestra and its Creolization. The sound is made for dancing."</p>
        <p>Ms. Ronstadt says she is not making much money doing this. "Frenesi" is the kind of record that makes a record executive cringe. "When I said I wanted to do the project I heard: 'Oh moan. Oh groan,' " she said. "The Spanish-language records sell a quarter of what my English records sell. It's good way to get poor. But I love the music. When I started doing the album I started dreaming in Spanish, so I was overjoyed to just let it flow, and I jumped into this project." Roots and Rhythm</p>
        <p>Roots and Rhythm, a mail-order company, which since 1974 has been the country's foremost source for older American popular and rural music, is the sort of place that offers so many goodies that it threatens the rent.</p>
        <p>Run by Frank Scott, an authority on blues and gospel music, the company's most recent catalogue includes the extraordinary eight-CD Louis Jordan box set, a huge selection of Japanese P-Vine imported CD's, including music by Johnny Shines, Lightnin' Slim and Lonesome Sundown. There's music from Peru, Cuba and Okinawa, along with klezmer music. There's country music -- Hank Thompson, Roy Rogers, Hank Garland -- folk and Irish. And there's a huge section of vintage rock-and-roll, along with jazz. The range is from budget-price $9 CD's to $30 Japanese imports.</p>
        <p>And for those looking for books, the catalogue includes Erik Raben's monumental jazz discography, and "The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll: Radio D.J.'s of the 50's and 60's," which explores, among other things, payola. And the company sells rock magazines.</p>
        <p>Running across another Roots and Rhythm aficionado is like running across someone who shares the same blissful guilt.</p>
        <p>"It's a wonderful resource and clearinghouse for roots music," said Andy McKaie, the vice president of catalogue development at MCA and the brains behind the terrific Chess Reissue series. "Frank does as much with his mail order to sort the good from the bad and promote the high end of the reissue field as anybody. He's a national treasure."</p>
        <p>But the company has been bitten by the recession and is badly in need of capital. Mr. Scott, the owner and an authority on earlier American music, is thinking about selling off his collection of rare 78's, a collection that includes records by Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters (his first session, which was with an electric jump band) and Lightnin' Hopkins. And the company, which sends out catalogues so varied and complete that they can virtually serve as discographies, is having trouble working up its next.</p>
        <p>"We're in the frustrating position of being far behind on payments because of the recession," said Mr. Scott. "The summer has been pretty slow, just like it has been in other industries. Major labels are not interested in working with smaller stores, so we're in trouble there. We're living day to day hoping that somebody would be interested in investing with us. We're going to survive, but it's going to be hard."</p>
        <p>Orders may be made through Roots and Rhythm, 6921 Stockton Avenue, El Cerrito, Calif. 94530; (510) 525-1494.</p>
