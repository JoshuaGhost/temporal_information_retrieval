        <p>When a gremlin flies in with an outrageous hand, conventional guidelines often fly out.</p>
        <p>There are times when the gods of the game seem to be playing a joke on the players. A case in point is the diagramed deal which they, or perhaps a mischievous gremlin, inserted into a duplicate game at the Executive Bridge Club in Hallandale, Fla., in March.</p>
        <p>It was reported by Polly Kogos of Great Neck, L.I., who held the North cards. South was Elizabeth Gross, who has taught bridge for two decades in the Great Neck Adult Education Program. East-West bid themselves to six clubs, accidentally from the right side. In the unlikely event that West had become declarer, a heart lead would have produced a decisive ruff.</p>
        <p>But South introduced her spades eventually, and North naturally saved in six spades. This was doubled with a sensational result. After a heart lead, ruffed in the closed hand, declarer drew the missing trumps in one round and began a crossruff. At the finish dummy's hearts were established and scored the last four tricks.</p>
        <p>North-South had now made all 13 tricks with a combined five points, the minimum possible. This was a heavy shock to East and West, but the gods had played an even deeper joke on them. If West had led anything except the obvious heart, he would have defeated the slam, although only by one trick. The fifth diamond would eventually score in the closed hand but dummy's hearts would wither on the vine.  [ Diagram ]</p>
