        <p>The United States and Israel are negotiating a major military cooperation package that would help compensate Israel for the sale of top-of-the-line F-15 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, Israeli and American officials said today.</p>
        <p>The package focuses on how to provide Israel with more access to American satellite intelligence and military equipment, especially high-technology items that would enable Israel to improve its own weaponry.</p>
        <p>President Bush and the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, have been discussing the details by telephone with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the last two weeks, and on Friday Israel's Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney set up a framework for negotiating the deal. Plan Faces Complications</p>
        <p>If all of the strategic and military ideas being considered are actually put into effect, the deal could greatly enhance Israeli-American military cooperation and Israel's advantage over its Arab neighbors, the officials said. But each one of the areas under discussion is complicated, either because of Israel's financial limitations or American laws barring export of sensitive technology. As a result, no one is certain what the final shape of the arrangement will look like.</p>
        <p>"Israel is in a period of shrinking defense budgets and so are we," a senior Administration official said. "We are looking for ways to be helpful to them that will not cost us or them a lot."</p>
        <p>Such a deal would also serve the Bush Administration's interest in appealing to Jewish voters in an election year, and Administration officials made it clear that they hoped to tie up these new arrangements quickly.</p>
        <p>At their meeting on Friday, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Shoval agreed to establish five negotiating committees made up of technical experts from both countries, to work out the different aspects of the package, officials said. They will begin work this week.</p>
        <p>One committee will discuss storing $200 million worth of American military stocks in Israel for the Israeli Army to draw on in a crisis. This program was already approved by Congress in 1990, as part of a three-way deal in which the United States forgave Egypt's $5 billion military debt and Saudi Arabia received arms.</p>
        <p>But the deal was never carried out because the Pentagon was uncertain about its future budgets after the cold war and therefore did not know how much equipment it could store abroad. American officials say they now have a better picture about the global disposition of forces and are ready to discuss how to carry out the three-sided arrangement.</p>
        <p>The same committee is also expected to consider storing in Israel enough equipment to stock an entire United States combat division, should one have to be rapidly deployed to the Middle East. If put into effect, such an arrangement would have a deterrent value for Israel, as well as a material one, since it would underscore the ability of American troops to rush to Israel's defense.</p>
        <p>A second committee will deal with Israel's request for $700 million in older, surplus American military stocks in Europe, which are being made available to allies as the United States military shrinks certain units. That too was legislated in 1990, but never carried out.</p>
        <p>The problem now is that Israelis hoped that after the cold war, there would be a retirement of some very sophisticated equipment by the United States, but that has not happened yet. The sorts of weapons Israel is interested in, like Apache attack helicopters, are not being made available. Indeed, the Pentagon itself is trying to acquire more. The lower-technology items are of less interest to the Israelis.</p>
        <p>A third committee will discuss how to tie Israel into the proposed Global Protection System, a combination of ground-based and space-based early warning radars that would provide quick warning of any hostile missile launchings. The United States initially proposed the system to the Russians, and have been signing up other nations to take part. Israeli officials say they are eager for improved intelligence cooperation to deal with the increasing missile threat from neighboring Arab countries.</p>
        <p>The fourth committee will look at ways of enhancing cooperation between the armed forces of the United States and Israel. This committee will also address Israel's request for a long-term commitment of $1.8 billion in American military aid that is now legislated annually, so that Israel's defense industries could make better investment plans. Funds for Israeli Industry</p>
        <p>Normally all such military aid is supposed to be spent in the United States on American weapons, but the Israelis are allowed to spend $475 million of it annually in Israel on their own home-made weapons systems, and this is an important source of funds for Israel's military-industrial complex.</p>
        <p>The fifth committee will examine ways of enhancing high-technology military cooperation. This is a key element for the Israelis. Mr. Rabin does not want 72 F-15's for Israel, and could not afford them. What he wants, say Israeli officials, is an answer to the problem of how Israel can deal with Arab arsenals stocked with advanced American-made weapons similar to Israel's.</p>
        <p>For that Israel wants to buy American technology that it can modify to develop home-grown systems far superior to Arab arms.</p>
        <p>American officials say they are ready to consider providing Israel with the technology cooperation the United States has with its NATO allies, in which they are given early involvement in American weapons designs. Limits on Transfers</p>
        <p>But there is also a downside for the Israelis in this form of enhanced cooperation. The more advanced American technology they are given, the more they will have to agree to restrict their own weapons sales to third parties, so this American technology does not fall into the hands of others. That could cost Israel Aircraft Industries and other Israeli arms manufacturers a number of contracts.</p>
        <p>The Administration sent to Congress today the formal notification of its plans to sell the 72 F-15's to Saudi Arabia. Under Federal law, Congress now has 30 days to reject the Saudi sale or let it go forward. With both the Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress having endorsed the proposed sale, which will provide $9 billion in revenues and 10,000 jobs, no serious objections are expected to be raised.</p>
