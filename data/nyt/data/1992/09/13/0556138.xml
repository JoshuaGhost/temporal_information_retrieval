        <p>Grambling routed Virginia Union in record-setting style tonight, 54-6, capturing the Whitney Young Classic before a crowd of 40,848 at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>With their victory, the Tigers (1-1) set records for most points by a single team and largest margin of victory in the annual contest that usually matches Grambling against other historically black colleges.</p>
        <p>The previous point mark had been held by Virginia Union and was achieved in its 46-37 victory over Grambling in this event last year.</p>
        <p>Alex Perkins, the Grambling quarterback, completed 8 of 28 pass attempts for 138 yards and two touchdowns. He was intercepted twice. Over all, the Tigers gained 468 yards. Fullback Eric Gant led the rushing attack with 18 carries for 93 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Virginia Union, playing its first game of the season, used three quarterbacks and managed just 136 yards of total offense. The Panthers committed seven turnovers on three fumbles and four interceptions.</p>
        <p>"I was most satisfied with the defense," said Eddie Robinson, the Grambling coach. "We had a real tough time last season. We were last in the league in defense."</p>
        <p>On the second play of the second half, Grambling, which led by 20-6 at halftime, broke Virginia Union's spirit with a 42-yard interception return for a touchdown by weak-side linebacker Lionel Cryer.</p>
        <p>Cryer's return, followed by Gilad Landau's extra point, put Grambling ahead, 27-6.</p>
        <p>Several minutes later, the Tigers increased their lead to 33-6 when tailback Norman Bradford scampered 20 yards for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>After a scoreless first quarter, Grambling began its rout with a touchdown by Gant 19 seconds into the second quarter.</p>
        <p>On first-and-goal from the Panthers' 1-yard line, Gant took a right-side pitch from Perkins and bulled his way into the end zone to give the Tigers a 6-0 lead. Landau added the extra point on a drive that spanned 8 plays and 59 yards and consumed 3 minutes 45 seconds. A 20-Point Cushion</p>
        <p>Grambling took a 13-0 lead on the prettiest pass of the evening, a 30-yard catch-and-run along the right sideline from Perkins to split end Stevie Anderson with 8:59 left in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Landau's second extra point gave Grambling a 14-0 lead.</p>
        <p>On Grambling's next offensive series, wing back Ron Dyson took a handoff from his own 34-yard line and dipped and darted his way through a maze of defenders for a 66-yard touchdown that gave the Tigers a 20-0 lead. Landau's extra-point attempt failed.</p>
