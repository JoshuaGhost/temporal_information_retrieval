        <p>Within a few years, a person may be able to drive a car in the thickest fog with full confidence of being warned if another vehicle or a pedestrian is nearby. To provide greater comfort, the driver may set the cruise control to maintain a space two seconds behind a vehicle immediately ahead on the highway. If there is a truck stopped in the road, an infrared camera will alert the car's computer, which will take control of the brakes and steering to bring the car to a safe stop.</p>

        <p>Within a few years, a person may be able to drive a car in the thickest fog with full confidence of being warned if another vehicle or a pedestrian is nearby. To provide greater comfort, the driver may set the cruise control to maintain a space two seconds behind a vehicle immediately ahead on the highway. If there is a truck stopped in the road, an infrared camera will alert the car's computer, which will take control of the brakes and steering to bring the car to a safe stop.</p>
        <p>Features of this sort are already being tested, and some options are expected to be available at car dealerships within five years. Some of the improvements are simplified versions of devices used in the airplanes, tanks and missiles that helped to defeat Iraq in the Gulf War.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest effort to adapt advanced technology to the family car is a European project called Prometheus (which stands for Program for European Traffic of Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety). "The main objective of our project is first improving safety and then the efficiency of the flow of traffic," said Don Hiett of Lucas Automotive, a company in West Midlands, England, that is participating in Prometheus.</p>
        <p>The program, which has existed for five years, is a cooperative effort whose members include leading European car companies like Jaguar, Saab, BMW and Ford's European unit; their suppliers; the European electronics industry, and research institutes. It is partly subsidized by European governments.</p>
        <p>Jaguar, based in Coventry, England, has been testing three of the technologies in different versions of its XJ6 model. The first system, called vision enhancement, allows a driver to see better in fog, in the dark, in driving rain or in any other low-visibility condition.</p>
        <p>The car is equipped with an infrared camera placed on the inside of the windshield in front of the rearview mirror. The camera is a thermal imaging camera, capable of sensing heat thrown off by any object that is in the path of the driver up to 100 yards away. The system translates heat emissions from car engines, lights, signs and even the human body into thermal images that are used to make a sharp black and white picture that is clearer than anything the human eye could see on a dark night or in a fog.</p>
        <p>"The lens technology is very important" in producing a sharp image, said Malcolm Williams, an electrical engineer for Jaguar and coordinator in England of the Prometheus Project. "Our requirements for the car are obviously less than the military requirements."</p>
        <p>A similar technology is already used by military aircraft and tanks to pinpoint precise targets in low visibility conditions. Here, it is used to enable a driver to avoid a target, like a person walking in the road.</p>
        <p>The image produced by the camera can be shown to the driver in one of two ways. In the Jaguar test car, the image appears on a television screen placed next to the glove compartment. But this is probably not the ideal display. "Showing the image on a conventional television screen is a bit distracting," Mr. Williams said.</p>
        <p>The alternative is to show the image on a "heads-up display," which is projected onto the lower windshield, so the driver does not have to take his or her eyes off the road. Heads-up displays are already common in military aircraft, where target and flight information are beamed in the direct line of the pilots' eyes.</p>
        <p>Similar displays are available as options in some cars, although they are limited to projecting the speedometer digits and other important dashboard information. The Prometheus technology would extend the feature to project images of objects that are outside the vehicle. It is being developed by Pilkington P.L.C., a British-based glass company with experience in military aircraft work.</p>
        <p>According to engineers at Pilkington, Lucas Automotive and Jaguar, the vision enhancement system may be in cars by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>Another system, which engineers hope to have ready for the consumer even sooner, perhaps within five years, is autonomous intelligent cruise control.</p>
        <p>This feature is an extension of existing cruise control, which regulates the accelerator to keep the car at a specific speed. The next generation will allow the car to maintain a calculated time gap from the vehicle ahead. It could automatically stay, for example, two seconds behind the vehicle in front, automatically braking if the lead car slows down.</p>
        <p>This system, which is intended for use on high-speed divided highways, uses a microwave radar sensor that targets cars moving away from it. In the British test cars this device is mounted behind the plastic license plate in the front of the car and transmits a radar signal.</p>
        <p>If there is an automobile ahead, the radar signal is reflected back to the sensor and sent to an on-board computer. The computer calculates the distance and the relative speed of the car in front. It can then adjust the speed so that a specific time gap is maintained between the two cars.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this computer would probably be put in the dashboard. For the test, it was placed in the trunk.</p>
        <p>Unlike current cruise control, the system being tested controls the brakes as well as the throttle. But "by choice, we have put in limited braking capabilities," not capable, for instance, of producing a sudden total stop, said Peter Martin, systems manager for Lucas Automotive.</p>
        <p>He said that if the cruise control system were given the power to stop a vehicle on its own, people might be reluctant to try it for the first time. "Once people trust the computers to operate the various functions on the car for them, they will then allow the computer to do more for them in the future," he said.</p>
        <p>Right now, Mr. Martin said, the aim is to keep the system simple. Mr. Martin said that all the technology is tested on the average person. In the case of the tests conducted by Jaguar, company secretaries were asked to try out the new equipment.</p>
        <p>"We must not get technically too carried away because the average guy must drive the vehicle," he said. "It's not like training your fighter pilot."</p>
        <p>The advanced cruise control feature is intended to improve the flow of traffic as well as to reduce driver fatigue. In the future, it is expected that the radar will become a more powerful device with a much wider angle. The signal will be able to scan the lane that the car is traveling in as well as the lanes to the right and the left and track more than 10 vehicles.</p>
        <p>A radar sensor is a prerequisite for collision avoidance systems, which would not only keep track of other objects on the road but take a powerful role in navigating around them. Such a system would use sensors, lasers, radar and a video camera to interpret a vehicle's environment and respond to any perceived threat.</p>
        <p>These devices are used to detect where the road is and where other objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, and stationary roadside objects are.</p>
        <p>The sensors and the camera will feed the information to a very powerful on-board computer, which will then determine whether the driver is in danger.</p>
        <p>For example, the computer will be able to tell if the driver is going off the side of the road by sensing whether the car is passing over the lane lines. If the computer feels that the driver is in danger, an alarm will be set off.</p>
        <p>The collision avoidance system is not only much more advanced technologically than the other systems but it will also be much more expensive. Still, there are some people who think such a system might be available early in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Somewhat later, the collision avoidance computer will have the capability to adjust the driving of the car -- the steering and the braking. But there may have to be new laws enacted before that can happen.</p>
        <p>"At the moment, we are working on systems that warn rather than interfere," said Mr. Martin of Lucas. But, he added, "Systems that take over will happen eventually."</p>
        <p>Similar projects are being developed in the United States by Chrysler, Ford and General Motors under a program called the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Society of America.</p>
        <p>"Because of all the government subsidizing in Europe, the Prometheus project has a several-year jump on us," said Gerald D. Conover, manager of intelligent vehicle-highway systems strategy and planning of the Ford Motor Company.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Conover said, "the work in the United States is complementary to the work in Prometheus." The companies share their information.</p>
        <p>In the United States, he said, the effort involves not only smart cars but also smart highways, "where the highways will also have sensors that will help guide the cars."</p>
