        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While the Administration is firmly committed to encouraging innovation in state health care programs such as the one submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services by Oregon, it cannot approve proposals that would allow for discrimination. I recently urged Oregon to submit a revised application for a proposal to change its Medicaid program, commonly referred to as the "Oregon waiver," which would address our concerns. Gov. Barbara Roberts of Oregon criticizes our withholding of approval (Op-Ed, Aug. 11).</p>
        <p>Many features of Oregon's proposal are innovative and would have the beneficial result of extending health care coverage to low-income people, including those with disabilities. In addition, the proposal emphasizes preventive health care. I strongly support these goals.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While the Administration is firmly committed to encouraging innovation in state health care programs such as the one submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services by Oregon, it cannot approve proposals that would allow for discrimination. I recently urged Oregon to submit a revised application for a proposal to change its Medicaid program, commonly referred to as the "Oregon waiver," which would address our concerns. Gov. Barbara Roberts of Oregon criticizes our withholding of approval (Op-Ed, Aug. 11).</p>
        <p>Many features of Oregon's proposal are innovative and would have the beneficial result of extending health care coverage to low-income people, including those with disabilities. In addition, the proposal emphasizes preventive health care. I strongly support these goals.</p>
        <p>There are also parts of the plan with which I strongly disagree. However, the Administration remains solidly behind state innovation. The reason for withholding approval of the Oregon plan is that there remain legal issues, which relate primarily to the Americans with Disabilities Act, that need to be resolved. Given the real possibility that Oregon's approach may serve as a model for other states, it is important that it go forward only with strict adherence to the law that President Bush has worked so hard to enact.</p>
        <p>Our principal concern is that Oregon's plan in substantial part values the life of a person with a disability less than the life of a person without a disability. This premise is discriminatory and inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Given the outpouring of comments received by this department and the White House on this issue, I am confident in saying Oregon would have been sued if we had approved the waiver, preventing Oregon from implementing the plan for years.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, we requested revision of the proposal to remove factors impermissible under the Americans with Disabilities Act. To assist Oregon, we sent an extensive memorandum to Governor Roberts that provides a road map describing how to bring the plan into legal compliance.</p>
        <p>It is not correct to state, as Governor Roberts does, that Oregon's plan "does not apply to the aged, blind and disabled until 1993." Those who would not be brought under the plan until 1993 are only individuals covered by the Supplemental Security Income program. Others with disabilities would have been brought immediately under the plan and been denied treatment because of improper consideration of their disabilities.</p>
        <p>It is misleading to imply there is wide support among disability groups for the Oregon waiver. We have received much unsolicited mail from organizations representing the disabled voicing strong objections to the plan. I have met a number of them.</p>
        <p>I am surprised by the allegation that this department gave Oregon no opportunity to respond to our legal concerns. In the weeks preceding my decision, Oregon's lawyers repeatedly conferred with this department and with the Department of Justice, and twice provided written opinions on the legality of the plan under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>This department is committed to protecting individuals with disabilities from discrimination. The next step for Oregon is clear: Oregon should fix the plan to comply with the law. I look forward to cooperating with Governor Roberts to reach this goal. LOUIS W. SULLIVAN, M.D. Secy. of Health and Human Services Washington, Aug. 13, 1992</p>
