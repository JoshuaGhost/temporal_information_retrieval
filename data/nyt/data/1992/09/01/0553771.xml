        <p>Pro-democracy campaigners imprisoned in northeast China have smuggled out a letter in which they charge that they are are often beaten, shocked with electric cattle prods and forced to work 12 or more hours a day making matchboxes.</p>
        <p>The letter, which was made public today by Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, accuses prison officials of torturing some political prisoners so severely that they passed out. It also says the officials often call on common criminals to beat and humiliate the pro-democracy prisoners.</p>
        <p>The best-known of the political prisoners reportedly subjected to this treatment is Liu Gang, a 30-year-old physicist who has campaigned since the mid-1980's for a free press and multi-party democracy. Mr. Liu is now in the fourth year of a six-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary conspiracy to subvert the government."</p>
        <p>It had been known that Mr. Liu and other political prisoners were being kept at the Lingyuan Prison complex in Liaoning Province in the northeast. But until now little has been known about their condition.</p>
        <p>The letter asserts that Mr. Liu has been beaten, kept in 20-pound leg irons and repeatedly tortured with an electric prod on his genitals. He is also said to have been forced to sit motionless on a bench from 8 A.M. until 9 P.M. each day, during which his legs swell.</p>
        <p>In November, Mr. Liu announced that he was going on a hunger strike, and 12 political prisoners joined him. According to the letter, the prison officials denounced this as a "prison riot" and isolated Mr. Liu from the other democracy campaigners. Since then, he has been kept with common criminals, one of whom, Li Chuanbo, is said to be allowed or encouraged to punch Mr. Liu often in the head.</p>
        <p>"But Liu Gang kept his spirits in these extremely harsh circumstances," the letter says. It says he wrote many letters to world leaders, "appealing to the international community to pay greater attention to human rights conditions in China." These letters presumably were seized by the guards.</p>
        <p>Other political prisoners have not seen Mr. Liu since April 11, when they met briefly before he was dragged away, and there is no word about his condition after that date.</p>
        <p>The conditions described in the letter, whose authenticity Asia Watch says it confirmed, generally correspond to those that former prisoners have described for a variety of Chinese penal institutions. The Government, however, denies that torture is common, saying guards are punished if they are caught beating inmates.</p>
