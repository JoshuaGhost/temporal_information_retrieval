        <p>The national movement to let students choose their schools enlisted a mighty player last week: New York City, with its almost 1 million students.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said that, starting next year, he will let parents send their children to any of the city's 32 school districts, not just to their neighborhood schools.

        <p>The national movement to let students choose their schools enlisted a mighty player last week: New York City, with its almost 1 million students.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said that, starting next year, he will let parents send their children to any of the city's 32 school districts, not just to their neighborhood schools. While he is still working out details, his plan will mean that parents of elementary and junior high school youngsters can scour the city for good schools and arrange to get their children there.</p>
        <p>The plan, however, has holes that make it something less than a bonanza for parents. There is no money for transportation; many parents would balk at sending children to an ideal school by subway. Also, many of the best schools already have long waiting lists.</p>
        <p>Gary Orfield, a Harvard University education professor who advised St. Louis on a choice plan, worries that without free transportation and money spent on recruitment, "you're creating schools which serve the most selective social and economic group" while schools with poor and less educated parents deteriorate.</p>
        <p>Still, some Manhattan districts have been experimenting, producing programs in the sciences, performing arts and other fields. The freedom -- and money -- to create distinctive schools is pivotal, says Joe Nathan, another adviser.</p>
        <p>"If you have two blue shirts made out of the same material, what kind of choice is that?" he asked.</p>
