        <p>THEY are the kind of men volunteer organizations dream about. Marc Burrell and Donald McCoskey like being firemen so much that when they finish their jobs as professional firefighters in New Rochelle and the second jobs they hold to make ends meet, they race home to volunteer to fight fires all over again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell, 36 years old, volunteers for the Town of Mamaroneck Fire Department and for ambulance duty in neighboring Larchmont, and Mr. McCoskey, 50, volunteers for the Lake Mohegan Fire Department. That's whenever Mr. Burrell isn't performing his duties as a paramedic for Nyack Hospital or when Mr. McCoskey isn't driving a school bus for the Lakeland Central School District.</p>

        <p>THEY are the kind of men volunteer organizations dream about. Marc Burrell and Donald McCoskey like being firemen so much that when they finish their jobs as professional firefighters in New Rochelle and the second jobs they hold to make ends meet, they race home to volunteer to fight fires all over again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell, 36 years old, volunteers for the Town of Mamaroneck Fire Department and for ambulance duty in neighboring Larchmont, and Mr. McCoskey, 50, volunteers for the Lake Mohegan Fire Department. That's whenever Mr. Burrell isn't performing his duties as a paramedic for Nyack Hospital or when Mr. McCoskey isn't driving a school bus for the Lakeland Central School District.</p>
        <p>"Most people would give such men parades and medals," said their lawyer, Stephen P. Falvey, an associate in the White Plains firm of Mead, Dore &amp; Voute, as he prepared another set of court papers for the clients he is defending without charge. "Instead, they have been forced to defend themselves for volunteering to save lives." Violating a Regulation</p>
        <p>In an unusual case that has generated suits and countersuits, the two men have been accused of violating a bylaw of the constitution of the International Association of Firefighters that prohibits members from participating in a competing organization, including volunteer fire departments.  The association, the only union representing professional firefighters, is affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and represents 195,000 firefighters nationwide.</p>
        <p>Competition between volunteer and paid fire departments is widespread in Westchester and elsewhere. Tensions between the two groups have mounted as municipalities with paid departments and scarce resources look for ways to cut costs and communities seeking ways to keep their volunteers offer pension plans and affordable housing, paid for with tax dollars.</p>
        <p>But the disputed regulation has been largely ignored because of the large but uncounted numbers of paid firemen who are believed to volunteer in their spare time. In Westchester, several fire chiefs who head volunteer units are professionals working for one of the county's four paid departments -- White Plains, Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle -- or for one of several departments that use both professionals and nonprofessionals.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Washington-based international association, which has reportedly been embarrassed by the publicity surrounding the case, notified the two men that the charges against them had been dismissed because a union trial had not been held within the required 120-day period since the issue was first raised in January.</p>
        <p>The two defendants say the association's action does nothing to change what they think is a "ridiculous" regulation, and both men have vowed to continue their efforts to eliminate the rule.</p>
        <p>"I wholeheartedly believe I'm not doing anything wrong, and these charges are an invasion of my civil rights," Mr. McCoskey, a Peekskill resident, said in describing his work at the Lake Mohegan Fire District. "I love what I do, and I am bringing that skill back to my community. Who's to say I can't save lives on my own time?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell agreed and said he would turn his full attention to the lawsuit against him by the Larchmont Professional Firefighters Association, Local 895, the organization he suspects filed the original internal charges against him. The Larchmont Fire Department is made up of both 14 paid firefighters and 150 volunteers. The Larchmont union local, with the support of the international association, is suing Mr. Burrell, Westchester Rockland Newspapers, which first reported the union charges, the reporter who wrote the story and several people who wrote to the The Daily Times of New Rochellesupporting the two volunteers.</p>
        <p>The Larchmont firefighters charge that it was the international association that filed the charges, not them, and that the newspaper, by publishing Mr. Burrell's suspicions, "wrongfully and willfully intended to injure and damage plaintiffs in their good name, reputation and professions." They also claim that the papers allowed letters to be published that they knew to be untrue. Under the umbrella of libel and defamation of character, they are suing the newspaper and some of the letter writers for $1 million each.</p>
        <p>Problems between the 60 members of the Larchmont/Mamaroneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps and the 14 paid Larchmont firefighters who work with them have been mounting following a decision by village officials about two years ago that firemen could join ambulance volunteers in responding to emergencies. Volunteer firemen are also sometimes at accident scenes. A Question of Emergency Training</p>
        <p>Ambulance volunteers, who complain that the paid firefighters are not adequately trained in advanced emergency-care techniques, say serious problems have resulted. Robert Murphy, president of the ambulance corps, said problems might have been avoided if inadequately trained firemen on the scene had not contributed to delays in treatment.</p>
        <p>"We train our people in advanced life-saving techniques," Mr. Murphy said. "We have asked the village repeatedly to require these firemen to get more training." Despite several meetings, Mr. Murphy said, village officials have not guaranteed that any training will take place.</p>
        <p>The emergency response system in Larchmont is one of the best in the country, Village Attorney James Staudt said. Local officials have spent "a ton of money," he added, to insure that each of the paid firefighters is a qualified emergency medical technician.</p>
        <p>"We love the Volunteer Ambulance Corps," Mr. Staudt said, "but I'm surprised they are saying the quality of our response team has fallen. Just the opposite is true. Our guys are so much better trained than they used to be."</p>
        <p>Soon after the dispute between the ambulance volunteers and the firefighters was made public, Mr. Staudt said village officials investigated and dismissed volunteer charges that the firemen were doing an inadequate job. "It's sad," Mr. Staudt said, "but this is just a private spat and a case of people getting angry and saying things they shouldn't."</p>
        <p>According to an incident report filed with Mr. Murphy by Mr. Burrell last July, Mr. Burrell, as a member of the volunteer ambulance corps, responded to an emergency call from a center for the elderly involving a woman who had fallen and injured her hip. Two paid members of the Larchmont Fire Department, which includes both professionals and volunteers, were already on the scene when Mr. Burrell arrived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell said in the report that the two firemen had rotated the victim's legs incorrectly and failed to splint them together and that it had taken them too long to call for an ambulance. "There was the potential for big complications," Mr. Burrell said. He said he had filed the report because "the crew chief and I weren't going to take responsibility for this."</p>
        <p>The incident report, intended to remain confidential, Mr. Murphy said, "got into the wrong hands" and precipitated the firefighters' complaint against Mr. Burrell, an action he termed a "personal vendetta." The union, Mr. Murphy said, "simply went after Mr. Burrell and his job." Mr. Murphy, who wrote a letter to the newspaper outlining his views, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The firefighters association has denied that it had anything to do with the charges filed against Mr. Burrell or that its members were slow in calling an ambulance crew in either of the two incidents.</p>
        <p>"My clients had nothing to do with these charges," said Alan E. Wolin, a partner in the Hicksville, L.I., firm of Lecci, Wolin &amp; Wolin and the lawyer for the Larchmont Firefighters Association.</p>
        <p>The firefighters, Mr. Wolin said, "do a superb job, and they have all the training they need." Although he refused to say whether the firemen would consider additional training, Mr. Wolin added, "It's a matter of the village administration being willing to pay for it." Job Security a Major Issue</p>
        <p>While the motivation for the charges over working for competing volunteer organizations against the two firemen remains unclear, one union leader said that job security is a major issue in the dispute.</p>
        <p>"We're trade unionists, and that's that," said Duncan MacRae, executive vice president of the New York State Professional Firefighters Association, which has supported the charges against the two men. "I want to provide jobs," Mr. MacRae, president of union Local 274 in White Plains, added. "An ostensibly ready-reserve force of volunteers," he said, "threatens the jobs of our members." He is named as a defendant in a countersuit being brought by Mr. Burrell and Mr. McCoskey.</p>
        <p>In October, Mr. Burrell said union bosses told him to give up his volunteer work with the Larchmont corps, where he has served 20 years, citing the international association regulation. "I had never heard of this rule," he said, "and I don't think anyone else knew about it. Everyone knows I'm a volunteer."</p>
        <p>Mr. Burrell and Mr. McCoskey are suing the international association, three union officials and two unnamed defendants in State Supreme Court in White Plains for $8 million, charging harassment, conspiracy and emotional distress. So far, Mr. McCoskey said he has not discovered the source of the complaint against him and that he is continuing to be pressed to quit his volunteer job. "I'm always wondering," he said. "I may be working next to the guy, and I worry. Firefighting is a team effort, and you have to rely on each other."</p>
