        <p>The President is overwhelmingly favored for re-election in the straw poll now being conducted at the Fraunces Tavern Museum in lower Manhattan. Among the serious contenders, Governor Clinton is a weak third, behind John Adams.</p>
        <p>The President in this poll is George Washington, elected to a second term as President 200 years ago this December. The polling place is a ballot box in the historic tavern where he bade his officers farewell at the end of the Revolution. And the Governor is George Clinton, the obstreperous Governor of New York at the time, who was trying to dislodge Adams as Vice President.</p>

        <p>The President is overwhelmingly favored for re-election in the straw poll now being conducted at the Fraunces Tavern Museum in lower Manhattan. Among the serious contenders, Governor Clinton is a weak third, behind John Adams.</p>
        <p>The President in this poll is George Washington, elected to a second term as President 200 years ago this December. The polling place is a ballot box in the historic tavern where he bade his officers farewell at the end of the Revolution. And the Governor is George Clinton, the obstreperous Governor of New York at the time, who was trying to dislodge Adams as Vice President.</p>
        <p>The museum has set aside an alcove to mark the bicentennial with a modest exhibition cleverly captioned "Re-Electing George," playing on the fact that again in 1992 a President named George is a candidate for re-election. But the parallel stops there. Whereas the current George has said he would do anything it takes to get re-elected, the earlier George would have done anything to get out and go home to Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>George Washington was finally persuaded that only he could hold the country together at that early stage of its existence and, without campaigning, won unanimous approval of the 15 states' electors. For George Bush, it doesn't look so easy.</p>
