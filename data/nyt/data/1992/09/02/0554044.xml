        <p>Among the volunteers helping with deliveries in the ruins of Hurricane Andrew, GEORGE STEINBRENNER could hardly go unnoticed.

        <p>Last Thursday, before President Bush sent in troops, Mr. Steinbrenner heard a radio appeal for help in loading relief trucks, a spokesman for Mr. Steinbrenner said. Without fanfare, Mr. Steinbrenner, who lives in Tampa, showed up at the Salvation Army's main distribution center with three other men, and told Capt. LARRY WHITE: "Put me to work."</p>
        <p>The spokesman said that, after loading trucks, Mr. Steinbrenner volunteered to drive a truckload of desperately needed water to Homestead. Warned about hijackings, he took two of his own security guards and drove six and a half hours through the stricken area, which was without street lights or signs.</p>
        <p>When the man who has been called the Hurricane George of Yankee Stadium returned to Tampa, he was apparently giving some orders of his own. "It was typical George," Captain White said. "He's a take-charge kind of guy." Since then, the Yankees boss has drafted friends and dispatched his minor league team from Fort Lauderdale to help the Salvation Army's relief effort. He also donated a truckload of baby food, saying: "There's nothing they need more than food -- baby food in particular -- diapers and water." Today he plans to drive another truckload of supplies, including batteries, to the devastated area.</p>
