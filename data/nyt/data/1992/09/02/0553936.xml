        <p>The United States announced on Monday that it had agreed in principle to buy billions of dollars' worth of bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in an attempt to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents and theft.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which would require the formal approval of both Governments, calls for highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear arms to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. It would be the first such agreement, and, if approved, would be a big step to reducing the dangers that made the cold war so unnerving.</p>
        <p>"It's a big deal," said Barry Daniel, director of public affairs for the Energy Department, which will buy the uranium. "This provides a way to move the highly enriched uranium from nuclear weapons dismantled in Russia into this country and to keep it out of the wrong hands. It also provides capital to Russia, and part of the proceeds go to increasing the safety of nuclear reactors over there. It's a win-win situation."</p>
        <p>The agreement was announced by the White House after months of secretive negotiations. In a statement, President Bush said it "illustrates how foreign policy accomplishments can promote our domestic economic well-being while making the world a safer place to live."</p>
        <p>The agreement calls for the United States to buy at least 80 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, with no less than 10 metric tons being bought in each of the first five years and no less than 30 metric tons thereafter. Private experts said that at prevailing market prices, that might amount to $5 billion or more over the period of the agreement. The experts generally praised the agreement.</p>
        <p>"It's very significant," said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private Washington group. "It doesn't prevent them from making new material. But what it does do, which is very good, is to remove a lot of excess weapons material from storage facilities that would otherwise be available for theft or sale to third parties." Natural Ore, Enriched</p>
        <p>Natural uranium ore is made up of a mix of isotopes, or forms of the same element with different atomic weights. Less than 1 percent of it is uranium 235, the fissionable isotope used in bombs and reactors. Uranium for most American nuclear power reactors is enriched to a level of about 3 percent uranium 235, while fuel for bombs in enriched by more than 90 percent.</p>
        <p>The agreement would basically reverse that enrichment process, diluting uranium 235 from bombs with natural uranium for use in commercial nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>Early this year, the Russians lined up several American companies that were eager to dilute highly enriched Russian uranium from warheads and to sell it as reactor fuel. And they repeatedly lobbied for the plan with Federal officials.</p>
        <p>In July, Viktor N. Mikhailov, head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, discussed the potential sale of Russian uranium in Washington with top officials of the Energy Department, which oversees the nation's production of nuclear arms and civilian reactor fuel.</p>
        <p>Among the American companies eager to make agreements are Allied-Signal Inc., an aerospace and chemicals company based in Morristown, N.J., which signed a preliminary agreement with the Russians.</p>
        <p>"We think it is a terrific agreement," said David G. Powell, senior vice president for public affairs of Allied-Signal. "Basically this is the beginning of a very productive arrangement by which we would in essence beat swords into plowshares." Interim Pact in July</p>
        <p>Allied-Signal and Nuclear Fuel Services of Erwin, Tenn., signed an interim agreement with Russian officials in July to buy 11 tons of highly enriched uranium by mid-1993, with similar amounts each year thereafter. No price was disclosed at the time.</p>
        <p>A big question is whether Russian bomb-grade uranium can be sold without significantly driving down prices on world uranium markets.</p>
        <p>Already, the cash-starved Russians have sold large amounts of natural and mildly enriched uranium in Western markets, feeding a price decline that has driven some uranium producers out of business and threatened the uranium enrichment business of the Energy Department, the world's largest supplier of commercial reactor fuel. No Budget Impact Seen</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniel, the Energy Department spokesman, said American uranium purchases would have no impact on the overall Federal budget because of money recouped from resales and from large savings in the department's own enrichment program.</p>
        <p>The White House said the purchases "would have no adverse impact on American consumers or jobs in the uranium mining or processing industries." It said the Energy Department would use the uranium to reduce the electricity costs at its enrichment installations.</p>
        <p>The cost of the purchases, Mr. Daniel said, will be "in the billions, but I can't put a specific number on it." He added that the purchases would probably occur over 10 to 20 years.</p>
        <p>By having the Energy Department make the purchases, the Government apparently wants to insure that the sudden influx of new material does not throw prices on the world uranium market into decline.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cochran of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the agreement "favored the mining industry over the consumer, because the alternative would be to sell it on the open market, which would reduce the prices of uranium and electricity."</p>
