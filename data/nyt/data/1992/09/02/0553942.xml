        <p>In a move that could lead to increased borrowing costs for the Nissan Motor Company, the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation has placed the company's debt rating on credit watch for possible downgrading.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's said the action affects about $8.7 billion of the debt of Nissan, the second-largest auto company in the Japanese market. The move was prompted by a decline in automobile demand in the slumping Japanese economy, continued weakness in overseas markets and heightened competition.</p>
        <p>Analysts at the rating agency said the decline in the Japanese economy was only part of the problem, as demand has fallen from very strong levels during the boom years of the 1980's and a new parking law has added to the difficulties of owning a car in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>In addition, increased competition has put pressure on pricing throughout the automobile industry and has raised the costs of marketing, the analysts said.  CREDIT MARKETS</p>
