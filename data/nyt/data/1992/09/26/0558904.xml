        <p>The Economy</p>
        <p>New orders for durable goods fell in August, the third drop in four months. The unexpected decline of one-tenth of 1 percent raised fresh doubts about economic recovery. Also, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes slipped 3.2 percent, despite the lowest mortgage rates in 20 years.  [ Page 33. ]</p>
        <p>Personal income slumped one-half of 1 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of $5.03 trillion, the worst drop in 19 months, as the effects of Hurricane Andrew more than offset what would otherwise have been a rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent.  [ 38. ]</p>
        <p>The Senate voted overwhelmingly against President Bush's proposal to permit taxpayers to earmark up to 10 percent of their income tax payment to reducing the national debt.  [ 33. ]  International</p>
        <p>The Japanese yen is emerging as perhaps the world's strongest major currency, at roughly 120 to the dollar, which could hurt Japan's already weakened automobile and electronics giants.  [ 33. ]</p>
        <p>France and Germany appeared to have won their battle against currency speculators, at least for now, maintaining the franc's value and salvaging Europe's monetary system.  [ 33. ] Markets</p>
        <p>The Dow industrials plunged 37.55 points, or 1.1 percent, to 3,250.32 on renewed concerns that economic weakness would hurt third-quarter earnings. For the week, the Dow was down 76.73.  [ 41. ]</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices rose sharply as the durable-goods and personal-income reports led some traders to conclude the Federal Reserve might push interest rates down further.  [ 41. ]</p>
        <p>Lawmakers are rushing to get a compromise futures markets bill onto the floor before Congress adjourns next week.  [ 42. ]</p>
        <p>Natural gas futures prices rose modestly after a day of seesaw trading at the end of a wild week.  [ 42. ] Companies</p>
        <p>The U.A.W. struck G.M. in Lansing, Mich., where the popular Pontiac Grand Am and other models are built, complaining that laborers are overworked. But G.M. takes 39 hours to make a car, compared with 22 for Ford, an analyst said.  [ 33. ]</p>
        <p>Lechters hopes to become the Gap of housewares by selling at lower prices than specialty chains like Williams-Sonoma. The Harrison, N.J.-based chain has 455 stores in 37 states and is expanding aggressively in the New York City area.  [ 34. ]</p>
        <p>GlenFed is fighting for its life. The owner of Glendale Federal, the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan association, is trying to wring profits out of its 200-plus branches by cutting costs and making less risky mortgage loans, while bargaining with regulators for enough time to put its house in order.  [ 34. ]</p>
        <p>Bell Sports has its eye on Europe's bare-headed cyclists. The leading American maker of bicycle helmets estimates that only 5 percent of Europe's 105 million riders wear helmets, compared with 20 percent of America's 93 million riders.  [ 34. ] Today's Columns</p>
        <p>Employee stock ownership plans can solve several problems at once for privately owned businesses, while minimizing taxes for the families who own them, Deborah P. Baker, a Chemical Bank vice president says. Jan M. Rosen: Your Money.  [ 35. ]</p>
        <p>Tiny bubbles of hardened gelatin that can store delicate proteins, viruses and even living cells without destroying them could ease administering many new drugs, say a team of university scientists who invented them. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents.  [ 35. ]</p>
