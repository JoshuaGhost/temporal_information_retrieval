        <p>The customary supporting cast was in attendance today at the Hippodrome de Longchamp: jockey Steve Cauthen, trainer Francois Boutin and the co-owners, Allen Paulson and Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the lead actor was missing.</p>
        <p>Arazi, the star-crossed former wonder colt, had been scheduled to make yet another comeback today in the 1,600-meter Prix du Moulin. Instead, Arazi had to be scratched after bruising his right hock in his regular stall on Saturday night. Plagued by Bad Luck</p>
        <p>"It's not serious at all, but his hock was a bit inflamed this morning," said the French trainer. "It's bad luck. Bad luck seems to follow me lately."</p>
        <p>Arazi's decline began last November when he underwent arthroscropic surgery to remove bone chips in both knees. Then after easily winning a low-level, 1,600-meter race in France upon his return in April, he entered the Kentucky Derby as the overwhelming favorite and finished a stunning eighth. And after a six-week layoff, he returned in June and placed fourth in the St. James Palace Stakes in Ascot.</p>
        <p>"What makes today so disappointing is that I know the horse was on top of his form," Boutin said. "He's been training beautifully and I felt very confident about his chances."</p>
        <p>Boutin remains guardedly optimistic and says that if the hock injury heals quickly, Arazi will run in either the 2,000-meter Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamp on Sept. 20 or in the mile-long Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on Sept. 26. The Ascot race is more likely because it is shorter. After that, the goal remains the one-and-a-quarter mile Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla., on Oct. 31.</p>
