        <p>Patricio on Staten Island</p>
        <p>For years I have been searching for a restaurant on Staten Island that would give residents of the other boroughs an excuse to ride the ferry over for dinner. Patricio, a short ride by taxi or by Staten Island Rapid Transit (three stops to the Clifton station) from the ferry terminal, is not quite that compelling, but it's probably as good as it gets on the northern end of the island.</p>

        <p>Patricio on Staten Island</p>
        <p>For years I have been searching for a restaurant on Staten Island that would give residents of the other boroughs an excuse to ride the ferry over for dinner. Patricio, a short ride by taxi or by Staten Island Rapid Transit (three stops to the Clifton station) from the ferry terminal, is not quite that compelling, but it's probably as good as it gets on the northern end of the island.</p>
        <p>Patricio is a comfortable and casual spot with brick walls, ceiling fans, plenty of elbow room, and a wooden porch with a barbecue grill. Periodically a train rolls by a few yards from the back windows. The year-and-a-half-old restaurant is owned by Colleen Mendola, an affable hostess, and her husband, Patrick, the chef.</p>
        <p>A recent visit found pastas and appetizers superior to main courses. One could compose a satisfying meal starting with the light, golden frito misto of vegetables ($4.95), followed by a mildly piquant linguine puttanesca loaded with green and black olives ($9.75). Other pastas to consider are the garlic-loaded linguine with white clam sauce ($11.50) and the orrecchiette tossed with tart broccoli rape, shrimp and sun-dried tomatoes ($11.95).</p>
        <p>Dense, leaden gnocchi would make deadly slingshot ammo ($9.75). Main courses like chicken scarpariello ($11.95), with sausages, mushrooms and vinegar, and a special of sole in a white wine sauce ($15.95) were bland. The best main course sampled was sauteed pork chops with broccoli rape ($13.95).</p>
        <p>Patricio has a run-of-the-mill wine selection and, it appears, a service staff that is inadequate for even a half-full dining room.</p>
        <p>Still, if you find yourself on the 50-cent ferry to Staten Island and want to extend the experience with a meal, Patricio is a worthy destination.</p>
        <p>Patricio, 695 Bay Street, Clifton, S.I., (718) 720-1861, serves lunch Mondays through Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M., dinner Mondays through Thurdays, 3 P.M. to 10 P.M. until 11 P.M. Fridays and Saturday; Sundays, 2 P.M. to 9 P.M. Visa and Mastercard are accepted.</p>
