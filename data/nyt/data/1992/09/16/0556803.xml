        <p>In a major step toward further centralizing power in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, the Kurds' two main political parties agreed today to merge their guerrilla units into a single force under Kurdish Government command, officials said.</p>
        <p>"We reached a good agreement," said Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, at the end of a day-long meeting in this mountain village with top officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</p>

        <p>In a major step toward further centralizing power in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, the Kurds' two main political parties agreed today to merge their guerrilla units into a single force under Kurdish Government command, officials said.</p>
        <p>"We reached a good agreement," said Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, at the end of a day-long meeting in this mountain village with top officials of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.</p>
        <p>The agreement followed weeks of negotiations between the two parties, longtime rivals that share power in the Kurdish region's parliament that was elected last spring.</p>
        <p>"It's very important because we want to have one armed force in Kurdistan and not several," said Kamal Fouad, a senior Patriotic Union member. "It's very important to support our Government."</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the parties will form a united force of about 30,000 guerrillas within one month, Mr. Fouad said. He said the force's size would likely double in a year.</p>
        <p>Each party now has about 100,000 guerrillas, and those not selected for the new force will be helped to find other work, he said.</p>
        <p>The merger is to be followed by talks with other, smaller parties which have a total of some 30,000 guerrillas. About a third of them will likely be absorbed into the new force, officials said.</p>
        <p>The merger is the latest of several recent steps to shift power to the new Government, officials said. The police were centralized earlier this month and plans are under way to open offices in Washington and other capitals.</p>

        <p>Kurds Report Atrocities</p>
        <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus, Sept. 15 (AP) -- Kurdish rebels said today that Turkish troops cut up the bodies of 18 Kurdish rebels killed in clashes and buried them in a garbage dump.</p>
        <p>The Kurdish rebels' press agency said in a report monitored in Nicosia that the naked, mutilated bodies had first been publicly displayed around Giole, a town in Turkey's eastern Kurdish-inhabited Kars province.</p>
        <p>The Kurdish Labor Party has recently stepped up its guerrilla war for an independent Kurdish state, with both sides accusing the other of atrocities. More than 4,500 people have been killed in the fighting since 1984.</p>
