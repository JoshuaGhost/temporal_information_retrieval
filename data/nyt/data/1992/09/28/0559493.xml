        <p>The only slight pennant chases left in the major leagues are in the American League East and the National League West, and even those are barreling toward their expected conclusion with the final week of the regular season upon us.</p>
        <p>Since the Pittsburgh Pirates clinched the National League East by beating the Mets, 4-2, and the Oakland Athletics are within a whisker of winning the American League West, it is up to the Toronto Blue Jays and Atlanta Braves to complete the probable playoff foursome.</p>
        <p>Toronto pounded the Yankees, 12-2, in New York yesterday and maintained a two and a half game lead over the Milwaukee Brewers as Joe Carter slugged four hits and Jack Morris became the first Blue Jay ever to win 20 games. The Brewers beat the Athletics, 5-3, for their 14th triumph in the last 16 games.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays have five home games remaining, and the Brewers have six road games left, but the clubs do not play each other again. Any combination of Toronto triumphs and Milwaukee losses equaling four will clinch the division for the Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>The Braves edged the San Diego Padres, 2-1, in 10 innings on Terry Pendleton's run-scoring single and inched closer to their second straight National League West title. They lead the Reds by five and a half games. The Reds nipped San Francisco, 3-2, for their 10th victory in 11 games; the game may have been the last to be played at San Francisco's Candlestick Park because the Giants have been sold to a Florida group hoping to move them to St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>The Pirates' victory gave them their third straight National League East title. Since the Athletics lost to Milwaukee, they still remain one victory away from winning their fourth American League West title in five years.</p>
        <p>Seattle's Randy Johnson struck out 18 batters, two short of the major league record. He played only eight innings, then came out because he had thrown an excessive amount of pitches.</p>
