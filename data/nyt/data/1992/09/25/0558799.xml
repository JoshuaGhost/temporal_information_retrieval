        <p>Merck &amp; Company's stock fell $1.125 cents yesterday after IMS America, a marketing research group that tracks prescription trends, reported that new prescriptions for its drugs were disappointing in August. Merck closed at $45.625 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second-most-active stock, with about 4.4 million shares traded.</p>
        <p>Separately, Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., said that it would continue a program to donate the drug Mectizan for treatment of a third-world disease called river blindness, but its chairman, P. Roy Vagelos, called for help with the drug's distribution. The drug has treated about four million people worldwide. "The problem is not making the drug but getting it into the jungles and into the bush where these people live," Mr. Vagelos said.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
