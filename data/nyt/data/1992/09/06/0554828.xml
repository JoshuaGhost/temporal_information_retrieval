        <p>Put the bowl bids on hold. Save the Heisman nominations.</p>
        <p>Boston College destroyed any excessive expectations about Rutgers football today as the Big East Conference's season began. The Eagles, getting three touchdown passes from Glenn Foley, were thorough and convincing in defeating the Scarlet Knights, 37-20, in a game previewed as one between teams behind only Miami and Syracuse in the Big East.</p>
        <p>"We got a little embarrassed," said Doug Graber, the Rutgers coach, who had tried in advance to play down the importance of the event. "It was the opening game of the season, no more, no less. We're 0-1 and away we go. Yes, I was bitterly disappointed."</p>
        <p>His disappointment was focused on the scrimmage line where, said the coach, "We got knocked off the ball, manhandled on both sides." Fortay Starts 1 for 9</p>
        <p>As for Bryan Fortay, Rutgers's new quarterback, Graber said: "I thought he got off to a shaky start. But he did darn well for his first college game. He'd been built up like a Heisman Trophy candidate."</p>
        <p>This was Fortay's fourth college game, but his first since 1989 when he played briefly in three games for the University of Miami as a freshman backup. He is a local product, having starred at East Brunswick (N.J.) High School.</p>
        <p>Fortay's statistics today were only a partial reflection of his passing performance: 19 completions on 40 attempts for 175 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. But Fortay completed only one of his first nine passes, and the fourth, poorly thrown to a covered target, was intercepted and returned by Charlie Brennan 52 yards to set up a field goal.</p>
        <p>Fortay aimed five times for James Guarantano, Rutgers's leading receiver, who could catch only one of the passes.</p>
        <p>Fortay started rolling out of his passing pocket as early as Rutgers's third offensive series to avoid the Eagles' pass rush coming from Jeff Stolberg and Mike Marinaro, who is nicknamed Bonecrusher.</p>
        <p>He was a scrambler most of the game as Rutgers had only one sustained offensive drive of more than 50 yards. That came in the third period, 71 yards in six plays, with Fortay completing four passes for 68 yards, the last one 23 yards to Craig Mitter for a touchdown. On that drive Fortay was at his best, what Rutgers hopes he will be in 10 more games.  Two Touchdowns for Brantley</p>
        <p>In the second half, Guarantano caught five passes and wound up with six receptions, as did Chris Brantley, the other wide receiver. Two for Brantley were good for touchdowns of 10 and 3 yards.</p>
        <p>Two of these scoring opportunities for Rutgers came after bungling by Boston College, a blocked punt by the Scarlet's Tim Geckeler and a fumbled fair catch of a punt by the Eagles' Clint Kuboyama.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, the Scarlet defense played poorly, especially the defensive secondary, which has been reckoned as the strongest part of the team.</p>
        <p>Foley, the Boston College quarterback from Cherry Hill, N.J., made big plays beginning with the game's third one, a 36-yard pass to the No. 3 tight end, Tony Schwartz, from a new formation that baffled the Scarlet Knights.</p>
        <p>Darnell Campbell, the tailback in the single-back pro formation who rushed for 107 yards, then ran 30 yards for a touchdown.  Big Plays for Boston College</p>
        <p>The Rutgers defense held Boston College without a first down for the next 20 minutes of play, almost to halftime, which found the Scarlet trailing, 17-7.</p>
        <p>There were other big plays for Boston College, touchdown passes by Foley of 45 and 12 yards to flanker Keith Miller and a 61-yard scoring pass from Foley to Greg Grace.</p>
