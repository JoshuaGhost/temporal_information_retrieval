        <p>While it is regrettable that Mary Fisher -- or anyone -- must suffer because of AIDS, I do not understand why she merits such special attention as a supposed profile in courage ("Aids Test," Aug. 16).

        <p>While it is regrettable that Mary Fisher -- or anyone -- must suffer because of AIDS, I do not understand why she merits such special attention as a supposed profile in courage ("Aids Test," Aug. 16). It is doubtful, as her illness progresses, that Ms. Fisher will have to worry about obtaining adequate medical care or keeping a roof over her head or feeding her children.</p>
        <p>I am truly sorry for Ms. Fisher. But I am a lot sorrier for the many less entitled wives, mothers and daughters in this nation living with AIDS whose brave struggles are unnoticed, unrewarded and seemingly unimportant to the Republican policy makers the Fisher family so gleefully continues to bankroll.
