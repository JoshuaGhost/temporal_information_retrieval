        <p>Everything looks smaller now. The mountain on Forest Avenue scaled on the way to school is just a slight pitch in the sidewalk, the big highway that stretched from the front of the house all the way to Chicago is only a road.</p>
        <p>Seeing an old house again after so many years is a little bit like unearthing old clothes -- a once-mod sweater that lost its shape, a newborn's teeny white shirt with built-in mittens, brought home from the maternity ward. Rooms are like hand-me-downs, lived-in and baggy. They bring flashes of recognition when you unfold them even though you know they no longer fit.</p>

        <p>Everything looks smaller now. The mountain on Forest Avenue scaled on the way to school is just a slight pitch in the sidewalk, the big highway that stretched from the front of the house all the way to Chicago is only a road.</p>
        <p>Seeing an old house again after so many years is a little bit like unearthing old clothes -- a once-mod sweater that lost its shape, a newborn's teeny white shirt with built-in mittens, brought home from the maternity ward. Rooms are like hand-me-downs, lived-in and baggy. They bring flashes of recognition when you unfold them even though you know they no longer fit.</p>
        <p>The house looks prettier today than I remembered. Like thousands of other suburban ranches built across the country in the 1950's, the L-shaped house on Sheridan Road with the big white garage in front was built by a contractor especially for young families like ours: Mom, Dad and two, soon to become three, daughters. It was never a house to drop dead over. It was solid and dependable, the architectural equivalent of a station wagon.</p>
        <p>It had knobby, angular fieldstones on the outside, a vague reference to the Frank Lloyd Wright houses nearby, and a simple modern plan. It was situated next to a vacant lot filled with May apples and trillium -- a little girl's custom-order enchanted forest, complete with crooked witches' fingers for branches. We moved into the house in 1956, when I was 2 years old, one family in a sea of families who had abandoned Chicago for the northern suburbs along Lake Michigan -- ostensibly seeking top-notch public schools. We lived in the house for nine years. In many ways, it hasn't changed, but as Alice found in the rabbit hole, everything suddenly was upside down. Now, for the first time, I have a family of my own. Perhaps this anchor was what possessed me to return. Suddenly, my legs felt tall. Instead of a golden key and a little bottle, as Alice found, there was an address sign, then a driveway, then a little bell beside the front door that whispered, "Ring me."</p>
        <p>It still looked like the quintessential suburban house, sturdy and modern in a moat of green. It was designed for what some are now calling "family values" in times that now seem simple. Such ranches on the suburban frontier, which recalled both local Prairie style as well as a distant place called California, were built horizontally, on one level, with everything within easy reach, physically fostering togetherness. The three-bedroom house had a knotty-pine-paneled "rec" room downstairs where the hi-fi inaugurated a new era in the household in the form of a 45-r.p.m. record called "Stop! In the Name of Love," and a backyard big enough for a swing set where the scent of barbecue mingled with insect repellent.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, last weekend, Doris and Stuart Bernstein, the couple who bought the house from my parents 27 years ago, opened the door. It was very much still the house I remembered. There were bleached blond built-ins everywhere, which, as ads in women's magazines were fond of pointing out, could glide open without disturbing a manicure. The picture window still presided over the living room. Though it became a sociological symbol of suburban conformity, all we knew was that you could breathe on it and draw pictures.</p>
        <p>It doesn't look out onto the woods anymore, of course. The woods, along with the field mice and the witches' fingers, have long been subsumed by new houses. In the Bernsteins' living room, a classic Eames lounge chair had long ago replaced the blue leather Paul McCobb armchair, chosen by my parents for its zoomy "contemporary" look but prized by their daughters for the boomerang back that doubled as a slide. There was no longer a sofa with fabric whose nubs were forever fused with Silly Putty. The stone fireplace -- daringly modern and mantel-less, almost risque -- was still there. But it was no longer a proscenium for teetering ballerinas in pink tutus trying to perform "The Nutcracker" between the andirons.</p>
        <p>Although they have lived there for 27 years, emotionally, the Bernsteins are more attached to</p>
        <p>their</p>
        <p>old house, where they raised their children, now grown. "You become attached to the house your children grow up in," Mrs. Bernstein remarked last weekend.  Each room in a house becomes a landmark in a personal landscape, however dimly recalled. Walking through the house, even today, the den was not a den but the place where we battled over bedtimes, the place where we first beheld the Beatles on "The Ed Sullivan Show." (We didn't know why all those girls were screaming but we knew it was important). The bathroom, still decorated with the pink tiles that every self-respecting 50's bathroom needed if it was shared by young girls, was not a bathroom but the place where we attempted to raise our own child, Donald, a duckling brought home from a county fair. (We later took Donald on a one-way trip to the zoo.)</p>
        <p>The L-shaped driveway, honored showcase for the Oldsmobile of stunning seafoam green, was the place where some of life's big and small lessons were learned. It was where a bicycle, suddenly minus its training wheels, veered off the blacktop to make near-permanent ruts in the lawn. It was where we piled into our schoolmate Stevie's mother's car -- it was her turn to carpool -- and heard the news on the radio that the President Kennedy had been shot.</p>
        <p>After so many years, experiencing a house again is a little bit like listening to music with the volume turned down. The effect is muted. In the Bernsteins' care, many aspects of our old house have clearly changed for the better. The amoeba-shaped backyard, which sloped downward, is now rimmed with flower beds, which are tranquil and beautiful. The kitchen is more open, no longer a vinyl-tiled warren. The attic, an exotic place with rafters where you could harvest dustballs that were magically suspended in air, has been almost completely converted into a master bedroom suite -- making the house technically a ranch house no longer.</p>
        <p>When I was in fifth grade, we moved to a big white house on Linden Avenue. I remember thinking it was a castle. The decor, tastefully accessorized down to the porcupine match holders, was the creation of decorators who ceremoniously unveiled their masterpiece to the family one evening in the manner of the curtains parting in "Let's Make a Deal."</p>
        <p>It had been the home of a famous writer and had its own stretch of ravine -- truly a house to die over. What really mattered, though, was that each daughter had her own room and that we -- not the decorators -- got to pick the colors.</p>
        <p>Like the house itself, our lives were more complicated on Linden Avenue. The tapestry of family life unraveled, as it did in so many other families we knew, and slowly, in a different pattern, the threads were woven back together again.</p>
        <p>So when I think of childhood, it is the ranch house on Sheridan Road -- less worldly, less lofty, more frozen in time -- that springs to mind. It's nice to know that it's being taken care of. And that it's still possible to be transformed into a little girl, summoning up the courage, just once, to ring the doorbell.</p>
