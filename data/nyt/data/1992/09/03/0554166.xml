        <p>A television production company that has created a syndicated special aimed at educating teen-agers about the virus that causes AIDS is disappointed: only about half the commercial time on the program has been sold so far.</p>
        <p>Jeff Pryor, a spokesman for GGP in San Francisco, said that advertiser concern over the program's subject matter had limited the sponsorships. He added that GGP stood to lose $100,000 if more advertisers did not participate in the one-hour special, called "Understanding H.I.V.: Does Teen America Know the Facts?"</p>

        <p>Mr. Pryor listed four national advertisers that had agreed to buy time: Chef America, Charles Schwab, SmithKline Beecham and Sundance beverages.
