        <p>The Mayor's Awards of Honor for Arts and Culture were given on Monday evening to eight New York City organizations and individuals.</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins presented the awards at Gracie Mansion as part of National Arts Week, offering praise for the arts as "one of the great channels for New York's indomitable energy."</p>
        <p>Awards went to the American Museum of the Moving Image for preserving and presenting the history of films; the Association of Hispanic Arts for its counseling and advocacy of Hispanic artists; Chemical Bank for its sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera's free concerts in the city's parks, and CBS News for its cultural programming, particularly "Sunday Morning."</p>
        <p>Awards also went to the Dance Theater Workshop for providing an outlet for visual and performing artists; Pregones Theater in the South Bronx, a Hispanic performing-arts group that offers free workshops to children; the Printmaking Workshop, for providing a hospitable environment for printmakers and for preserving their craft, and the family of Frederick P., Daniel and Elihu Rose, for their philanthropy and leadership in the arts.</p>
        <p>The awards were established in 1976 to recognize career achievements and the contributions of patrons of the arts.</p>
        <p>"By these awards, the city says we do not take the arts for granted," said Ellen Liman, chairwoman of New York City's Advisory Commission for Cultural Affaira, which selects the recipients. "We express our civic appreciation today to those who have helped the city maintain its leadership, and the Mayor sends out the message that in this city the arts are to be celebrated as vital to the city's financial and spiritual health, not scorned as elitist, which they are not, or sacrificed as if they were luxuries."</p>
