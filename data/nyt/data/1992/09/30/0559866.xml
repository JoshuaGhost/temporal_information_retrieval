        <p>CALF'S liver has long been a delicacy in France, where the methods of preparation are endless. In this country it has gained in popularity over the last 20 years or so, but it is still far from a staple on restaurant menus.</p>
        <p>The assertively flavored yet delicately textured meat goes well with sauces that combine richness with a touch of acidity, like lemon or wine vinegar. Another good source of acidity is capers.</p>
        <p>A classic recipe that I learned early in my professional cooking career is calf's liver a l'anglaise, which involves sauteeing slices of liver with onions, bacon and lemon juice. A simple and fast recipe that I often make at home is calf's liver with a sauce of browned butter and red wine vinegar. Sauteed onions can be added to the sauce for extra sweetness.</p>
        <p>Calf's liver is a highly nutritious food. It is one of the better sources of iron, calcium, vitamins A, D, E and K, and all the B vitamins. It should be noted, though, that all kinds of liver are relatively high in cholesterol, so those people on a restricted diet should eat it sparingly.</p>
        <p>When shopping for calf's liver, look for the freshest available. The meat should be light pink and without blemishes. Kosher brands usually offer excellent quality.</p>
        <p>As for the recipe here, the liver is cooked quickly in a nonstick skillet, and the sauce is made by browning some butter and adding capers and vinegar.</p>
        <p>Potatoes seem to be a natural accompaniment to calf's liver. Here I suggest sauteeing cubed potatoes with sweet peppers, which adds nice color to the plate as well as sweetness. Calf's Liver With Capers and Black Butter  1 1/4 pounds calf's liver, cut into 4 slices Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1/3 cup flour for dredging 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 tablespoons butter 4 tablespoons capers drained 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 4 tablespoons chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Sprinkle each slice on both sides with salt and pepper, and dredge it in flour on both sides, shaking off the excess.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet large enough to hold the slices in one layer. Cook the liver on one side over high heat for 2 minutes or less. Turn the slices over and cook for 2 minutes more for rare.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer the slices to a heated plate or platter. Discard the fat from the skillet.</p>
        <p>4. Add the butter to the skillet and let it melt. Add the capers and vinegars to the skillet and bring to a boil while swirling around. Pour this mixture immediately over the liver, and sprinkle with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:</p>
        <p>370 calories, 20 grams fat, 530 milligrams cholesterol, 425 milligrams sodium (before salting), 30 grams protein, 15 grams carbohydrate. Sauteed Potatoes With Sweet Red Peppers  1 1/4 pounds russet, Idaho or Washington potatoes 1 large sweet red pepper Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 3 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil  1/2 cup white onions thinly sliced 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the potatoes into 1 1/4-inch cubes. Drop them in cold water to prevent discoloration.</p>
        <p>2. Core and remove the seeds and the veins of the sweet peppers. Cut them into 1/4-inch cubes.</p>
        <p>3. Drain the potatoes and add them to a saucepan with water to cover and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 1/2 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <p>4. Heat the oil in a large, nonstick skillet. Add the potatoes, and cook over medium-high heat, shaking the skillet and stirring occasionally so that the potatoes cook evenly. Cook for about 5 minutes until they begin to brown.</p>
        <p>5. Add the red peppers, onions, salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, shaking the skillet until the potatoes are nicely browned.</p>
        <p>6. Drain the potatoes into a colander. Return them to the skillet and add the butter. Cook for a few minutes, shaking and tossing the skillet. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
