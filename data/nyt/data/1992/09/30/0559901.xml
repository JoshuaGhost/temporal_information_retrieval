        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 7 news article "Mentally Ill: Unmet Goals for Albany" was an excellent analysis of the status of mental health programs in New York State. It contained what should be a shocking fact: 50 percent of those in state psychiatric facilities are there because of a shortage of community support and residential programs.</p>
        <p>Why aren't more New Yorkers outraged that 6,000 New Yorkers are unnecessarily hospitalized? Why aren't taxpayers demanding that the Governor and his Division of the Budget and state legislators figure out how to break the gridlock that is keeping people institutionalized and a disproportionate share of mental health funds tied to deteriorating institutions -- at a cost in the billions?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 7 news article "Mentally Ill: Unmet Goals for Albany" was an excellent analysis of the status of mental health programs in New York State. It contained what should be a shocking fact: 50 percent of those in state psychiatric facilities are there because of a shortage of community support and residential programs.</p>
        <p>Why aren't more New Yorkers outraged that 6,000 New Yorkers are unnecessarily hospitalized? Why aren't taxpayers demanding that the Governor and his Division of the Budget and state legislators figure out how to break the gridlock that is keeping people institutionalized and a disproportionate share of mental health funds tied to deteriorating institutions -- at a cost in the billions?</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's because too few outside the mental health community understand the strides that have been made over the past 20 years in helping those with a severe mental illness lead productive and fulfilling lives. Advances in medications and good community support programs allow individuals to live in the community, have friends, attend school or go to work. The options of those with a severe mental illness are not limited to a hospital back ward or a grate on the street.</p>
        <p>Programs like Fountain House can provide necessary support at costs far below those of institutions: $42,000 annually for housing and support and vocational programs versus $120,000 for an institution. We receive more than 100 referrals a month, but we only have the ability to welcome 15 to 20 new members a month. Some of those we cannot accept may enter another program, but others will remain in shelters, on the street or in hospitals.</p>
        <p>This situation is unfair, unwise, and inhumane. State funds allocated for mental health purposes should have as their primary purpose the rehabilitation of those with a mental illness, not the "economic development" of job-starved upstate communities. KENNETH J. DUDEK Executive Director, Fountain House New York, Sept. 17, 1992</p>
