        <p>To some people (the editors of Harper's magazine, for example), an ellipsis, the three-dot mark of punctuation in a text that indicates words have been omitted, is a trifling thing, dispensable. To others, like Gordon Lish, ellipses are crucially informative, and their required use in precise communication is an indisputable principle, which if not worth dying for is at least worth suing over.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Lish, a novelist, an editor and most pertinently, a teacher of fiction writing, a man who has said he once quit a job over the inappropriate insertion of three commas into a letter, is suing Harper's, over, among other things, ellipses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish, 58 years old, an editor at Alfred A. Knopf, the author of four novels and editor of the literary magazine The Quarterly, has long been a strident advocate of the experimental narrative voice, both in his own work and that of others', and from his end the suit has taken on the aspect of high art defending itself against crass commerce.</p>

        <p>To some people (the editors of Harper's magazine, for example), an ellipsis, the three-dot mark of punctuation in a text that indicates words have been omitted, is a trifling thing, dispensable. To others, like Gordon Lish, ellipses are crucially informative, and their required use in precise communication is an indisputable principle, which if not worth dying for is at least worth suing over.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Lish, a novelist, an editor and most pertinently, a teacher of fiction writing, a man who has said he once quit a job over the inappropriate insertion of three commas into a letter, is suing Harper's, over, among other things, ellipses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish, 58 years old, an editor at Alfred A. Knopf, the author of four novels and editor of the literary magazine The Quarterly, has long been a strident advocate of the experimental narrative voice, both in his own work and that of others', and from his end the suit has taken on the aspect of high art defending itself against crass commerce.</p>
        <p>"It means more to me than anything in my life the sentences that I write," Mr. Lish explained in a legal deposition.</p>
        <p>In the literary world, the suit, which will be heard in Federal District Court in Manhattan beginning Sept. 30, has raised both eyebrows (in amusement) and hackles (in concern), since what to many seems an exercise of ego on the part of a notorious industry eccentric has the potential to affect copyright law, which has been particularly malleable in recent years.</p>
        <p>"It's a frivolous lawsuit because it's about Lish's vanity," said John R. MacArthur, the publisher of Harper's, which, founded in 1850, is America's oldest magazine. "But it's not a frivolous issue."</p>
        <p>The suit stems from the publication, without Mr. Lish's permission, in the December 1990 issue of Harper's, of a letter Mr. Lish wrote that summer to the students who had enrolled in his private writing seminar. Mr. Lish, who is suing for copyright infringement, false representation, libel and "tortious infliction of emotional distress" contends that Harper's first stole his work and then altered it (that is, the editors deleted passages without using ellipses) and did so maliciously and for commercial gain.</p>
        <p>Harper's defense is that there is no copyright infringement because the letter is informative about a well-known figure and his public activities and thus -- like other lists, announcements and memoranda that the magazine has published without permission -- is newsworthy.</p>
        <p>The editing of the letter, the editors say, was fair, and preserved both its thematic content and tone. The libel charge is absurd, they add, since the words Mr. Lish claims to be libeled by are his own.</p>
        <p>"I'm flattered to be the first editor ever to be accused of libelous editing," said Michael Pollan, the Harper's editor who trimmed the letter in half for publication. 4 Pages of Prose</p>
        <p>The letter, which Harper's obtained from a prospective student who decided not to take Mr. Lish's class, was four pages long, single-spaced, and written in the flamboyantly exhortatory prose for which even Harper's editors say Mr. Lish has a gift.</p>
        <p>"It is absolutely unacceptable to me that this term not prove to be our most heroic yet," it begins. "Everything points to the gathering in of amazements, . . ." (Ellipsis added.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish, in his deposition, acknowledged that the letter was "not written in a normative fashion."</p>
        <p>"It's fused with an excess of style," he said.</p>
        <p>But that, said his lawyer, Jonathan Lerner, does not give Harper's the right to purloin it. In fact, he said, style -- rather than factual information is precisely what copyright law is meant to protect.</p>
        <p>"It's an exploitation," Mr. Lerner said. "Harper's ought to be ashamed of itself." 'A Touch Prophetic'</p>
        <p>Legal considerations aside, the case is a dramatization of the polarizing role Mr. Lish plays in the New York literary community, where he has long held the reputation as a legendary editor, prominent in the making of his own legend.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, there are those who support his unyielding vision precisely for its unyieldingness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish, said the writer Cynthia Ozick, "May have a quixotic, tilt-at-windmills quality, and that's what people outside him see. The suit may be seen as tilting at windmills. I know he's neither reckless, nor does he tilt at windmills. He says what he sees. He wants to set the world right."</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are those who think he's a self-aggrandizing flake.</p>
        <p>"I haven't met a single person who doesn't think this is lunacy on Gordon's part," said Alice K. Turner, fiction editor of Playboy, who has been called by Harper's as an expert witness on magazine publishing policy.</p>
        <p>"Gordon is trying to muzzle the press, which I would take at face value if he were some innocent," Ms. Turner said. "But after all Gordon is a veteran of Esquire, which in his day was the hippest magazine around."</p>
        <p>It was at Esquire in the 1970's that Mr. Lish, who declined to be interviewed for this article, helped shape the literary decade and became known by the nickname (perhaps self-coined) "Captain Fiction."</p>
        <p>He has been a champion of such prominent and decidedly diverse writers as Ms. Ozick, Raymond Carver and Don DeLillo (whose novella appears in the current issue of Harper's), but he has most often been associated with a school of writing, characterized by fierce introspection and experimental language, which itself has drawn separate camps of admirers and detractors, among them Lewis H. Lapham, the editor of Harper's.</p>
        <p>But nothing in his career has so drawn fire as his writing seminars, mostly Lishian monologues that often last six hours or more. Mr. Lish insists on the sanctity of what goes on in them. (One of the deletions Harper's made in the letter was his call for confidentiality). Journalists have occasionally infiltrated the class and written about it, mostly unflatteringly, but his students, some of whom pay a $2,400 fee over and over again to keep taking the course, are often unstinting in their praise.</p>
        <p>"Gordon is cajoler, an inspirer, a larger-than-life figure with the highest standards," said Lynn Grossman, a professional screenwriter who has taken the course several times. Striking Back?</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Lish's contentions is that Mr. Lapham is acting out of animus. The publication of the letter is the second time Harper's has tweaked Mr. Lish with his own words, the first being the publication of the jacket copy on his collection of short stories, "Mourner at the Door," which said of Mr. Lish: "There is no other contemporary figure in the nation's literary community whose presence is as widely or as urgently felt."</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish had written the words himself, Harper's said.</p>
        <p>It is also true, however, that Harper's has published -- and paid for -- two of Mr. Lish's short stories, and that Mr. Lapham used a drawing by Mr. Lish's son, Atticus, as the magazine's cover illustration.</p>
        <p>Harper's contends the animus is on Mr. Lish's part, pointing out that he is getting the services of a huge law firm, Skadden, Arps, Meagher, Slate &amp; Flom, at a reduced rate. "I'm not putting in a new tennis court with this one," Mr. Lerner said. Purely and simply, Harper's says, Mr. Lish is out to exact revenge. Deciding What's Protected</p>
        <p>Legal experts agree that Mr. Lish's copyright claim is his strongest.</p>
        <p>"The law favors Gordon with respect to copyright violation," said Martin Garbus, the First Amendment lawyer who is a friend of both Mr. Lish's and Mr. Lapham's. "It's an unpublished work and as a result is entitled to a great deal of copyright protection."</p>
        <p>But even Mr. Garbus acknowledges that the question of the law itself might not be the only one to ask.</p>
        <p>"The writer of something should have the right to protect what he created," he said. "But shouldn't the press, when it sees something noteworthy, have the right to publish it and comment on it?"</p>
        <p>Recent cases have, in fact, narrowed the doctrine of "fair use" -- that part of copyright law that defines the rules of borrowing work without permission -- and limited publishers' liberties in that area.  Determining 'Fair Use'</p>
        <p>In 1983, the Federal District Court in Manhattan fined The Nation magazine for publishing excerpts, without permission, of the about-to-be-published memoirs of Gerald R. Ford, the former President, a decision that was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. And in 1987, the Supreme Court refused to review an appeals court decision that a biography of the hermitic writer J. D. Salinger could not be published because it relied too heavily on Mr. Salinger's unpublished letters.</p>
        <p>Gregory Diskant, a lawyer for Harper's, argues that the Nation case, in particular, established that the primary criterion for fair is that an excerpt not curb a written work's commercial value. "If the piece is written not to be sold, then copyright laws don't exist to protect it," he said.</p>
        <p>What does exist to protect such work are laws concerning privacy and private property, he said, but the use of copyright infringement as a veil for a privacy claim is a threat to the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>"We're not saying there's free reign on publishing private things," Mr. Diskant said. "It would have to be newsworthy. But if you allow copyright infringement as a surrogate for privacy, you allow Bill Clinton to sue over the publication of his draft letter."</p>
        <p>In his deposition, Mr. Lish, who seeks space in Harper's to redress his grievances as well as punitive damages, said the letter's publication had been costly to him both emotionally and physically. He suffers from psoriasis, a condition aggravated by stress, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lish was asked, during his deposition, whether he knew of anyone who, as a result of the letter's publication, holds him in lower regard.</p>
        <p>"To give a most earnest answer, I certainly am such a person," he said.</p>
