        <p>The Swedish central bank lowered its short-term rate for commercial banks to 50 percent from 500 percent today, a day after the Government and opposition announced an austerity plan that would raise taxes and cut welfare.</p>
        <p>The central bank had raised the rate to the record high on Wednesday in an effort to keep the Swedish currency, the krona, from being devalued as capital flowed toward the German mark during the European currency chaos. The stratospheric rate shut down virtually all lending, but the 50 percent rate is still likely to virtually freeze credit.</p>
        <p>Officials said they hoped interest rates would soon return to normal, about 13 percent, but they continued to refuse to devalue the krona to halt the currency selloff.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the center-right coalition Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt made an economic pact with the opposition Social Democrats to stabilize the economy by cutting the $18.4 billion deficit, raising taxes and slashing welfare benefits such as sick pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bildt said the package was intended as a signal to the market that Sweden was serious about maintaining economic stability and the level of the krona, which is tied to the European currency unit. His coalition and the Social Democrats hope Sweden will join the European Community by the middle of the decade.</p>
