        <p>By the time Marshall Faulk had his moment in the afternoon sun today, the game was already in the fourth quarter and San Diego State was trailing badly.</p>
        <p>But Faulk saw an opening, danced through the hole, cut to his right, sprinted past a defender and crossed the goal line. Nice run, but much too late to help the Aztecs.</p>
        <p>Faulk gained 46 yards and scored a touchdown on his best run of the day, but No. 23-ranked San Diego State was beaten by No. 11-ranked U.C.L.A., 35-7, under a searing sun at the Rose Bowl. Voters for the Heisman Trophy may have rushed for their erasers after the game.</p>
        <p>Faulk finished with 118 net yards in 23 carries -- it marked his ninth straight 100-yard rushing game dating to last season -- but eight of his tries were for losses and four others gained 3 yards or less. Average Stuff</p>
        <p>Remove his long gainer, which came on his 20th attempt, and he was just 22 for 72, a 3.27 average. Not the stuff of Heismans.</p>
        <p>"It's not a setback in my mind," Faulk said later of his Heisman chances. "But if the people who are picking think it wasn't a good game, that's just them."</p>
        <p>The Bruins (3-0) scored two touchdowns in a 57-second span of the opening period, one of them following a Faulk fumble, then sat on the lead until the third quarter. U.C.L.A. quarterback Rob Walker threw for two scores in the final period.</p>
        <p>And while Faulk had all the pregame hype, the best work belonged to the Bruins' runners: Tailback Daron Washington had 114 yards in 14 attempts, Kevin Williams 96 in 19 carries and Sharmon Shah 68 in 10. U.C.L.A. rushed for 330 yards.</p>
        <p>San Diego State (1-1-1), which is likely to fall out of the top 25 in the upcoming polls, was troubled all afternoon by bad snaps. Starting center Mike Alexander was hurt early in the game, and his replacement, guard Joe Heinz, had difficulty working smoothly with quarterback David Lowery, who was coming back from weeklong back spasms.</p>
        <p>The Aztecs fumbled four times and lost three.</p>
        <p>"We expected a close football game," said Al Luginbill, the San Diego State coach. "There's no excuse for not snapping the football and turning it over."</p>
        <p>The victory gave the Bruins a 15-0-1 record over San Diego State and a 9-0 mark since the teams resumed their regular series in 1984. But the Aztecs always seem to have problems outside not only their own conference, the Western Athletic Conference, but the Big West as well, going winless in their last 19 games.</p>
        <p>Faulk couldn't change their fortunes, and he didn't do much for his Heisman hopes.</p>
        <p>"I've set a standard for myself," he said. "I have to go out every week and try to fulfill it. I don't have any excuses this week."</p>
        <p>Faulk misfired the first time he touched the ball, and his day grew progressively worse. By the time he got it again, the Aztecs were behind, 14-0, and struggling simply to slow U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>But Faulk's problems weren't entirely of his own doing. A handoff from Lowery was low, bouncing off Faulk's knee and into the arms of Bruins defensive end Mike Chalenski at the San Diego State 25. One play later, Williams took a pitch and sprinted down the sideline for a two-touchdown lead.</p>
        <p>Faulk had no more luck on the Aztecs' next series. He caught one pass from Lowery for 17 yards, ran for 7 more on a draw and had another reception for 2 more. But on second down at the U.C.L.A. 40, he fumbled again as he hit the line, losing 2 yards and the ball to linebacker Arnold Ale.</p>
        <p>Faulk's best run of the half came in the second period after a 45-yard pass from Lowery to wide receiver Darnay Scott put the ball at the Bruin 30. A draw play to Faulk gained 14 yards to the 8, but he went backward from that point: a 1-yard loss on his next carry and a 2-yard loss after that. Another Lowery pass fell incomplete, and U.C.L.A.'s Sale Isaia blocked the ensuing field-goal attempt of 29 yards.</p>
        <p>At halftime, Faulk had 30 yards in 10 carries, but as he showed today, he typically saves his best stuff for the second half. In his first two games, 377 of his total of 519 yards -- that's 73 percent -- had come in the second half.</p>
        <p>Faulk began the day with an average of 177.1 rushing yards per game, putting him on a pace to break the National Collegiate Athletic Association career record of 174.6 by Cornell's Ed Marinaro in 1969-71.</p>
        <p>But the real Heisman candidates could have been Williams, Washington and Shah, all of U.C.L.A., each of whom had more than 50 yards on the ground through two periods.  COLLEGE FOOTBALL</p>
