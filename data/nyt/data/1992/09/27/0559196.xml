        <p>THE crisis in European currency markets has taken a harsh toll on mutual fund investors whose funds own foreign bonds and notes. These funds lost more than 2 percent of their value on average in two weeks that ended last Thursday, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.</p>
        <p>This devaluation of mutual fund shares caught many investors by surprise, especially those in short-term global income funds. But obstacles in creating monetary union in Europe may actually be good news for holders of long-term global bonds who are able to ride out short-run price moves.</p>
        <p>Still, investors in the United States should not underestimate the chaos roiling Europe. "We've seen a breakdown of the European monetary system equal to the 1987 stock market crash in the United States," said David R. Kenerson Jr., who manages the Van Eck World Income Fund in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The pandemonium in European financial markets has helped to discredit the idea that short-term global income funds are suitable substitutes for money market funds. The short-term global funds, which were introduced a few years ago and already hold more than $22.5 billion, aim for share price stability using a complicated hedging technique that relies heavily on the premise that European currencies will fluctuate within a narrow range. That premise no longer holds.</p>
        <p>But for investors holding shares in short-term global funds, "there's no reason to sell if you understand that some currency risk means moderate risk to principal," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago. Investors who found the recent turbulence too much should move their cash back into domestic money funds, he said.</p>
        <p>While some of the world's attention in recent weeks has been focused on drastic moves in foreign-exchange rates, it is interest rates that move bond prices first, noted A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. And so, he said, investors should be considering the opportunities rates are offering. Many fund managers say a fall is inevitable for European interest rates, which are unusually high, but they disagree on when this will happen. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise, producing capital gains for bondholders.</p>
        <p>Most global bond fund investors were hurt in recent weeks as foreign-currency bonds were sold and the proceeds were moved to the relative safety of dollar-based investments. In the week that ended on Sept. 17, the Benham, Franklin and MFS funds declined more than 4 percent each. But looking forward, managers say that European bonds represent the best value of debt securities anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>Fiona Biggs manages the top-ranked Dreyfus Strategic World Investing Fund, a fund with wide latitude to invest in either stocks or bonds. Right now, her bond exposure is greater, and she owns bond futures to gain leverage because "the European economy will be so much worse than people expect." She added, "The European economic cycle is a few years behind the United States' ."</p>
        <p>The best reason to buy shares in European bond funds is for diversification that provides a hedge to investments in dollars for times when United States markets are reeling, said Mr. Kenerson at the Van Eck World Income Fund. And the best time to invest is after a crash, he said. He predicts continuing volatility in the short term, but as the volatility subsides, there should be "improvement in bond prices and currency generally."</p>
        <p>Indeed, while investors have been expecting rates to decline in Europe, "the currency breakdown has accelerated the natural process," said Steven Ilott, with Rowe Price Fleming in London, which manages the T. Rowe Price global bond funds.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Dreyfus fund and several others, the T. Rowe Price International Bond Fund makes limited use of hedging, which protects against currency swings. Hedging limits losses, but it also reduces gains.</p>
        <p>European bonds have not yet rallied, and there is a very good chance that interest rates will decline and create capital gains, said Nimrod Fachler, who manages the Paine Webber Global Income Fund. His strategy at this point is to invest in long-term bonds in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France -- the countries with the strongest currencies.</p>
        <p>Over all, the outlook for investors who already hold European bonds is good, said Steve Bartow, chief investment officer for Putnam's global fixed-income group. Britain cut its interest rates last week, and Italy is expected to do so soon. But public opinion polls indicate that most Germans do not favor giving up the mark in favor of a single European currency, he said, and this sentiment "doesn't get us out of the soup in terms of ongoing volatility."</p>
        <p>Investors hoping to profit from Europe's crisis must look at how heavily a fund is invested there. For those who expect European bonds to rise, the more a fund has in Europe, the better its prospects. The high-ranked IDS Global Bond Fund, for example, has relatively little invested in Europe. It normally keeps only 20 percent of its portfolio in Europe and owns even less today, said Ray Goodner, its manager.</p>
