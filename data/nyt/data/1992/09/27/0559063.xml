        <p>WHEN the 1986 law on excess distributions was passed, people who had at least $562,500 in their retirement plans as of Aug. 1, 1986, were given the opportunity to protect that money from excise taxes. But those who took this "grandfather" option faced a maddening set of rules that were intended to prevent too much of a tax break.</p>
        <p>To begin with, when the protected money is distributed, it can exceed the general annual limit on retirement benefits that are exempt from excise taxes. But it is counted against that limit, restricting the amount of other pension money that can be received tax-free. And even if a retiree takes only other pension money in a given year -- leaving the grandfathered nest egg alone -- part of the distribution is deemed to be from the nest egg.</p>

        <p>What's more, those who took the grandfather option must use a lower general exemption limit, at least initially. The limit, which is indexed, started at $112,500 in 1986 and this year is $142,276. When it exceeds the $150,000 that has applied from the beginning to other retirees, probably in 1994, both groups of retirees will get the higher amount.</p>
