        <p>As the dawn lightens, the first entrance of the Greek chorus shocks an audience into realizing just how astonishing Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil really is. The double door at the distant rear swings open and in they surge -- 15 red-clad women (though some are really men), stamping and swaying with a gleeful joy that is very close to barbaric fury.</p>
        <p>There is little scenery in the modern sense, but the look is still riveting: faces covered with chalk-white makeup, like masks; headpieces, and costumes with full skirts, vests and glittering ornaments that are an ingenious hybrid of the ethnic cultures stretching from southern Italy through the Middle East to southern India.</p>
        <p>Miss Mnouchkine's Theatre du Soleil (Theater of the Sun), an institution in Europe for nearly 30 years, is quintessentially French and inherently cosmopolitan. A nearly lifelong Parisian, Miss Mnouchkine has created a unique style that blends world theatrical cultures in the service of Western classics and contemporary epics.</p>
        <p>Outwardly similar to the work of another Paris-based theatrical internationalist, Peter Brook, Theatre du Soleil's stylistic fusion is more diverse and organic, its enunciation of the French language more elegant and its dance and music closer to Pina Bausch and other European choreographers. Although Miss Mnouchkine has her detractors, she has won critical admiration and audience enthusiasm that is close to adulation.</p>
        <p>Despite her fame abroad, her company has visited the United States only once, presenting Shakespeare in French at the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles. Now, finally, the company will make its New York debut, with three cycles of its current four-part project, called "Les Atrides," or "The House of Atreus." The performances will take place over an 11-day period starting Thursday at the specially refitted Park Slope Armory in Brooklyn, under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>Americans are hardly used to hearing theater in foreign languages; in Brooklyn, incomprehensibility will be alleviated by the familiarity of the plays and by translation through earphones. But more than language separates Theatre du Soleil from conventional Anglo-American theater. In addition to its synthesis of theatrical traditions, the company is a commune, a radical popular theater born of leftist idealism that speaks to theater lovers all across the political spectrum. When three of its four parts were staged in Paris last June, the conservative American monthly New Criterion called "Les Atrides" the "most exciting and innovative theatrical experience on earth."</p>
        <p>Miss Mnouchkine is a cheerful woman with a handsome face, a winning grin and Brillo-like gray hair, given to baggy yet comfortably stylish clothes. She combines the images of fierce theatrical moralist, bubbling happy child, nurturing mother and forbidding French intellectual. (It was she who branded Euro Disney a "cultural Chernobyl.")</p>
        <p>Although she was born in Paris in 1939, the daughter of Russian immigrants, Miss Mnouchkine's first connection to theater was at Oxford. "I went there to study psychology," she said, during a break from tour performances in Montpellier, not far from Marseilles. "But then I joined the Oxford University Drama Society, and one day I said, 'Of course, this is what I want to do.' "</p>
        <p>In the early 60's, she embarked on a year's journey to Asia, then founded Theatre du Soleil in 1964. From the first, it was a visionary enterprise, a band of leftist romantics convinced that they could change the world. And although the personnel has turned over completely, the vision remains consistent.</p>
        <p>"Theatre du Soleil is the dream of living, working, being happy and searching for beauty and for goodness," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It's trying to live for higher purposes, not for richness. It's very simple, really."</p>
        <p>The theater got its name through a similarly openhearted idealism. "At the time theaters were named for their directors, but I could not imagine calling it Le Theatre Ariane Mnouchkine," she said. "We were looking for life, light, heat, beauty, strength, fertility . . ."</p>
        <p>In 1970 the ensemble took possession of what has remained its home ever since -- three airy warehouses in the Cartoucherie (or weapons depot, which is what it was up to the 19th century), in the Bois de Vincennes just east of Paris. Today, the first of the warehouses is a huge lobby space, the second a transitional area, and the third, the 1,200-seat theater: sharply raked bleachers and a huge square performing area bereft of wings or flies or changeable scenery. It is this theater that Miss Mnouchkine insists be replicated whenever her company tours. But touring performances cannot duplicate the all-embracing mood in Paris, the sense of having entered, willingly, into another world.</p>
        <p>The company spent the 1970's exploring France -- "telling our history in order to make it advance," as she once put it. In 1979 she shifted gears, with her own adaptation of Klaus Mann's novel "Mephisto." Then, in the early 80's, came Shakespeare: "Richard II" (the company's first comprehensive employment of Asian masks and costumes), "Twelfth Night" and "Henry IV, Part I."</p>
        <p>The success of the Shakespeare productions brought yet another change of direction: two nearly daylong epic pageants about contemporary Cambodia and India by the French feminist intellectual Helene Cixous (see-zou). The next project was to have been another Cixous blockbuster, this time on the controversial topic of the Vichy regime.</p>
        <p>"Helene Cixous was ready, but I was not," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It so difficult to imagine such a close period in time and space. Before, when we talked about France, it was a long time ago, and when we talked about now, it was far away. The Resistance images are still with us, from photographs and films. I felt my dreams were not free, not theatrical: they were still realistic."</p>
        <p>Instead, Miss Mnouchkine plunged back into the classics. It was her idea, for "Les Atrides," to preface Aeschylus' "Oresteia" trilogy with Euripides' "Iphigenia in Aulis," written more than 50 years later and more sympathetic to Clytemnestra; her grief at the sacrifice of her daughter makes her murder of her husband more understandable. It's better theater and better feminism.</p>
        <p>Beyond sheer spectacle, "Les Atrides" is striking for the power of its choruses, the omnipresence of the music and the doubling and redoubling of the principal parts. The chorus changes from fiercely joyful women in "Iphigenia" to soldiers overcome by the horror of war in "Agamemnon" to black-clad, vulturelike harridans in "The Libation Bearers." In "The Eumenides" they become terrifying mythic beasts, no longer dancing but growling and snarling, led by three harpies straight from a Brechtian proletarian netherworld and standing as eternal threats to human benevolence.</p>
        <p>The ever-present background music is provided by Jean-Jacques Lemetre, who has been with the troupe for 14 years. When actors are speaking, he leaps among his battery of exotic instruments, a megalomaniacally inflated one-man band, although for the chorus dances he falls back on recorded ensemble music. He says his music is so intimately wedded to speech rhythms that having other musicians accompany him would be nearly impossible, and a live dance ensemble would be too expensive.</p>
        <p>More unusual still is the casting of a few actors in most of the major roles. The most dramatic case is that of Simon Abkarian, a French-born Armenian raised in Lebanon who spent many years in Southern California -- as a cabaret dancer, he says. Mr. Abkarian plays Agamemnon, Achilles, a chorus leader, a messenger, Orestes and, to cap this tour de force, Orestes' nurse.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian Juliana Carneiro da Cunha, a dancer trained in the school of Maurice Bejart, does both Clytemnestra and Athena in "The Eumenides"; the Indian Nirupama Nityanandan is Cassandra, a chorus leader, and Iphigenia, a role in which her 20 years of training as a Bharata Natyam dancer in Madras can be seen to especially beguiling effect. Brontis Jodorowsky, born in Mexico of a Chilean father and a French mother, plays a host of secondary parts.</p>
        <p>Artistic decisions are described as simple deductions from unassailable "evidence"; that doubling parts may make dramatic sense is dismissed as coincidence. "What I call theatrical evidence just emerges," Miss Mnouchkine said. "It's not discussed. We discuss when something goes wrong, when for two or three days we are stuck. When the work is going, we don't discuss, we work."</p>
        <p>The actors concede, however, that Miss Mnouchkine makes the final decisions. Mr. Jodorowsky sees her as almost like a Zen master: "She directs not by adding things but by taking things away, down to the more and more simple, the more essential."</p>
        <p>Dismissive of most acting today, with its uninflected imitation of life, Miss Mnouchkine prefers a broadly emotive style that recalls what we know of early Western theater and that still exists in the non-Western world. Not for her, despite her own academic background, the psychological identification of the typical modern Western actor. "We flee daily life," she said in an interview in The Drama Review. "We do not talk of psychology but rather of the characters' souls. The theater is not supposed to represent psychology but passions."</p>
        <p>Miss Mnouchkine believes that masks (or masklike makeup) liberate acting from pale realism. In "Les Atrides," the masks and makeup become simpler as the plays approach modernity. Yet, Miss Mnouchkine says, the mask is always there -- "the mask of character."</p>
        <p>She categorically rejects the idea that she has poached on exotic cultures. "What we do derives completely from the action of the characters," she said. "Iphigenia is not using the real steps and mudras of India, which would mean nothing to us. She's just showing her feelings. She's not using the codes; she's using what is inward.</p>
        <p>"IMPERIALISM IS NOT MY problem; it is your problem," she said, speaking of Americans. "Cultural imperialism is the opposite of what we do. It is the repressing of other cultures. It's what we suffer from in France, with the film and television products of the United States."</p>
        <p>Economically, Theatre du Soleil is still a commune, although its members live in their own apartments with whomever they please. It is legally organized to share income -- at present, 60 people (including Miss Mnouchkine and the 26 actors as well as backstage personnel) receive 9,000 francs ($1,800) each per month. "It's a small salary," Miss Mnouchkine said, "but it's not worse than many other theaters."</p>
        <p>The company is given $1.4 million annually by the French Ministry of Culture, the figure having been doubled in 1981 when the Socialists took power. The rest of its income (roughly twice the subsidy in an average year, according to Nathalie Pousset, a company administrator) derives from the box office and fees from tour hosts. Miss Mnouchkine rejects corporate sponsorship, but the New York debut was insured by French corporate support from Air France and Elf Aquitaine.</p>
        <p>Right now, the troupe is a young one, with the veteran actors having only six or seven years of tenure. "When we started, we were there for all our lives," Miss Mnouchkine recalled wistfully. "But of course it's a mistake to think that."</p>
        <p>Miss Mnouchkine holds annual workshops, usually 10 days long, and although she says they are not auditions, she gets most of her actors from them. By all evidence this is a happy group, full of people who really like one another. Miss Carneiro da Cunha, for one, speaks lyrically of her new friendship with Miss Mnouchkine, how they left a late show in Toulouse and rode through the streets on their bicycles as the sun came up.</p>
        <p>Still, there is the potential for estrangement between the director and her actors. "People who come here may be nervous at first," Miss Carneiro da Cunha said. "They know Ariane as somebody very famous. But after a while they just see Ariane. And they're famous, too, collectively. What is difficult is the question of age. I've aged and they have not."</p>
        <p>Although the company remains true to its Utopian ideals from the 60's, the Utopia seems now to be expressed in religious terms -- the theater as a sacred space and art as an avenue to the divine.</p>
        <p>"That is all very personal, very intimate," Miss Mnouchkine said. "We never go on stage thoughtlessly, without saluting it, some little sign, just putting a hand on the stage. For some it's religious, for others superstitious, for others just a habit. Our actors never step on the stage without realizing that it relates to spirit and the progress of the mind." ASSEMBLING THE PARTS</p>
        <p>"Les Atrides" will be presented under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music at the Park Slope Armory, Eighth Avenue and 15th Street.  The four plays will be performed in three four-part series: the first is this Thursday and Friday and Oct. 8 and Oct. 9 at 8 P.M.; the second, Saturday at 3:30 and 8 P.M. and Sunday at 1:30 and 6 P.M.; the third, Oct. 10 at 3:30 and 8 P.M. and Oct. 11 at 1:30 and 6 P.M. Each performance runs approximately two and a half hours, without intermission.</p>
        <p>Series tickets are sold out, but seats remain for individual performances. Tickets are $40 and can be purchased through Ticketmaster and at the BAM ticket office (but not at the armory). Information: (718) 636-4100.</p>
        <p>Seating is reserved by section only; there are no reserved seats and latecomers will not be seated. Doors open one hour prior to curtain time, and the audience is invited to secure seats and then visit the dressing area beneath the armory bleachers to watch the troupe put on costumes and makeup.</p>
        <p>For simultaneous translations of performances, which are in French, headsets can be rented for $5.</p>
        <p>Picnic meals are available prior to curtain time and between performances on weekends.</p>
        <p>To reach the armory by subway, take the F train to the Prospect Park-15th Street stop and walk two blocks north. A free shuttle bus goes to the armory from BAM, 30 Lafayette Avenue, 90 minutes before each performance and returns to BAM up to an hour afterward.</p>
