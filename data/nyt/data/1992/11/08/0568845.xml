        <p>When you are as insightful as William Safire and use campaign trivia (like pandering to the far right, loss of control of the national convention, mistaken judgments by campaign handlers, etc.) as the reasons for your candidate's loss of popularity, one has to suspect the motivation. To adopt the posture of a party stalwart doing some serious soul-searching about why your candidate and your party have failed to find the support of the American people and not to address the problems of breach of faith that are represented by Irangate, Iraqgate, the savings and loan fiasco is disingenuous at best.
