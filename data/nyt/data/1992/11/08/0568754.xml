        <p>Tina Sinatra removed her sunglasses and sat down to lunch at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: fried eggs, burned bacon and a lot of filter-tipped cigarettes. She laughed, but just a little. "I don't know why, but when I'm in New York I want breakfast." She made it sound like the Last Supper.</p>
        <p>Tired eyes, comfort food and nicotine, but with an explanation. Ms. Sinatra had just completed the work of a lifetime: "Sinatra," the authorized five-hour, $18.5 million video biography of her famous father. And after eight years, it was a little like emerging from psychoanalysis. But analysis is intensely private, and Ms. Sinatra's project is anything but. Tonight at 8 and Tuesday night at 9, anyone in America with a television set tuned to CBS can watch. She hopes millions will.</p>
        <p>"I'll smoke until the ratings," Ms. Sinatra said. "I swear. And then I'll stop."</p>
        <p>In late-20th-century show business, this is as big as it gets, even for a celebrity giant like Frank Sinatra. After exhausting multiple careers (teen-age heartthrob, pop-music icon, Oscar-winning film star, Washington-insider wannabe and, in his autumn years, show-business institution with oak-leaf cluster), Mr. Sinatra has finally achieved immortality: he is a mini-series.</p>
        <p>"Sinatra," as vast and as complicated as World War II, is the nonfiction novel or novel nonfiction of a life so large, so crash-bang and so public that if much of it weren't already known he and his daughter might be accused of making it up.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, it features the proverbial cast of thousands, including Rod Steiger as the Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana; Olympia Dukakis as Mr. Sinatra's strong-willed mother, Dolly; Gina Gershon as his long-suffering first wife, Nancy; Marcia Gay Harden as his firebrand second wife and the love of his life, Ava Gardner, and Philip Casnoff as Mr. Sinatra.</p>
        <p>But that's just the beginning. Remember, this is Sinatra. There's hardly a pop-culture figure in this century he didn't bump into or have a drink with on his journey from Hoboken to the old Paramount Theater in Manhattan to Las Vegas. Household names with actors' faces pop into view continually. It's pseudo-stargazing, or a bit like playing Where's Waldo, with versions of Waldo popping up all over the landscape.</p>
        <p>Besides the actors needed to portray Sinatra family members and various agents, publicity men, managers and flunkies, there are actors to play Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr., Mia Farrow, Juliet Prowse, Marilyn Maxwell, Humphrey Bogart, Jo Stafford, Sonny Werblin, Buddy Rich, Sy Oliver, Fred Zinnemann, Michael Romanoff, Westbrook Pegler, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James, Jimmy Van Heusen, John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Joseph P. Kennedy, Peter Lawford, Major Bowes and Prince.</p>
        <p>With so much real life to draw from, a documentary, not a docudrama, would seem in order, but Ms. Sinatra, who is the project's executive producer, said that was never on the menu.</p>
        <p>"I think because he's too much of a romantic," she said of her father. "I don't think he wanted to make a science out of it. He wanted to make a film about his life. His notion was to create this saga about his life, which I find extremely bold and brave. Most people wouldn't have done it."</p>
        <p>She said the idea of a feature-length motion picture had been kicking around since about 1980 with another producer. "All I said to Dad was, 'I think you should do it as a mini-series because it's much too epic in proportion.' What turned the tables was the magic word, the word mini-series."</p>
        <p>A book was never considered, either.</p>
        <p>"He said, 'How can I tell my life story without giving the people my music at the same time?' " Ms. Sinatra recalled. Mr. Sinatra himself has declined interviews.</p>
        <p>But for a man who guarded his privacy even as he flaunted his loves, his hates and his professional ambitions, his eagerness to document his life seemed contradictory. Again, Ms. Sinatra demurred.</p>
        <p>"It's very much in his character to do something that isn't normal," she said. "If you know his temperament, his ego, you know this is something he would thumb his nose at and say, 'I can do this in my lifetime. Better I do this in my lifetime than somebody else when I'm gone.' "</p>
        <p>And as is often the case with stories of this scope, the effort to portray the man and his times was as complicated and frustrating as the man himself. With one brief exception (producing another television movie), Ms. Sinatra, who is 44 years old now, has worked on nothing else since early 1985.</p>
        <p>After the first writer had done two and a half years' research and writing, a new writer, William Mastrosimone, was hired. He repeated the process. CBS wanted the project, then it didn't, and when a new administration came into power at the network, it did again.</p>
        <p>To direct, Ms. Sinatra chose James Sadwith, a veteran producer and director with credits that include "Baby M" (1988) and "In Broad Daylight" (1991), both fact-based made-for-television movies.</p>
        <p>"I had very low expectations," Mr. Sadwith said of his interview for the job. "I walked into Tina's office, and Sinatra music was playing. I was thinking, 'What's Sinatra's daughter going to let me do?'</p>
        <p>"There was only one way I would do it," he said. "As gritty and reality-based as possible, no glitzy tribute to Frank. I told her, 'In the late 60's his music was anathema to me, and so were his politics. So what you're going to get from me is good drama.' They called me the next morning and said I had the job."</p>
        <p>With casting completed late last year, Mr. Sadwith and Ms. Sinatra set out to cut an eight-hour script down to five hours and find a way, as Mr. Sadwith put it, to make a film more like "Raging Bull" than "The Jolson Story."</p>
        <p>What they have is a bit of both.</p>
        <p>Like those tuneful episodic movie biographies of the 1940's and 50's, "Sinatra" is classic Hollywood formula with strict chronology for support. But there is a difference. The familiar moon-June-spoon script gives way to wine, women, song and pain.</p>
        <p>It starts in Hoboken in 1925, when the young Francis is 10 years old, and documents his courtship and marriage to Nancy Barbato, the mother of Nancy, Frank Jr. and Tina, and early success with the James and Dorsey bands. By the time Mr. Sinatra leaves Dorsey, in 1942, there have already been some high highs and low lows. But there is nothing comparable in the film to the emotionally draining relationship with Gardner, his second wife.</p>
        <p>"Ava represented something altogether different for him," Ms. Sinatra said. "I believe it was good for him. I believe all those Capitol years, all those wonderful saloon songs, came from that soul that was touched by her.</p>
        <p>"You can track his entire life if you just look at the chronology of his music," she said. "He sings how he's feeling."</p>
        <p>In fact, there are 25 recordings of Mr. Sinatra on the soundtrack (many of them from the 1950's, the Capitol Records period) and a few more that sound just like him but aren't. There were no recordings of the very young Sinatra; instead, an Australian named Tom Berlinson came forward to audition and the similarity is stunning. (See if</p>
        <p>you</p>
        <p>can tell who's singing "I'll Never Smile Again.") In the middle years, after Mr. Sinatra's voice has been injured, a raspier tone was needed in some scenes, and Ms. Sinatra's brother, Frank Jr., filled in.</p>
        <p>Readers of "His Way," the unauthorized 1986 biography by Kitty Kelley (the book the Sinatras love to hate) will be disappointed that not every wart she described is accounted for. But others may be surprised at how candid Ms. Sinatra and her father have chosen to be, about his mob associations, his ambition and his despair at career crossroads.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinatra said recollections from her father and mother formed the core for the script and that Mr. Sinatra acted as source, not censor. Scores of others were interviewed, she said, and their recollections were cross-checked with her father's. Mia Farrow, Mr. Sinatra's third wife, was very helpful, she said, but Ava Gardner refused to be interviewed. Gardner died in 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sinatra comes across as a great talent who did not always play well with others. But there is no attempt to explain him.</p>
        <p>"We don't have a Rosebud," said Ms. Sinatra, referring to the sled iconography in Orson Welles's film "Citizen Kane." "He is an enigma to me. He is an enigma to his wife. All wives -- I'll be generic.</p>
        <p>"We express him," she said. "We have put you in his skin for five hours of film. I didn't say I was going to explain him. I try to give a sense of how it felt to be him. I can't explain him. I couldn't explain you. I can't explain myself. It's not my job. And in a way, it's nobody's business.</p>
        <p>"What you get from the film is that this kind of artist, this very special gifted person from God brings with him something that is unique," she said. "But somewhere there is something that is not whole. It makes them a little unstable, a little volatile. It's part of the gift of the talent, this thing that's missing.</p>
        <p>"I say it's the fact that they remain a mystery to us that keeps us so attracted to them."  TELEVISION</p>
