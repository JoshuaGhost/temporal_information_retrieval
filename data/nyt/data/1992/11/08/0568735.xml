        <p>Ask not why the Tampa Bay area of Florida should get the Giants of San Francisco; ask why Bob Lurie should not be permitted to sell the Giants to the Tampa Bay group.</p>
        <p>Major league club owners are expected to answer the questions surrounding the status of the Giants at their meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Tuesday. Their decision on the future address of the Giants will very likely set off additional developments, such as lawsuits. Still, if the owners block the Giants' move to Florida, the Tampa Bay group should look twice before suing.</p>
        <p>The prospective Florida owners have threatened to sue the San Francisco bidders for allegedly interfering with their deal with Lurie. Before it's over, they may direct their anger toward Lurie for making the deal -- that is, making a deal he apparently wasn't allowed to make.</p>
        <p>Any sale or move of a franchise is subject to approval of the other owners and the commissioner. Lurie reached agreement with the Tampa Bay group two months after Fay Vincent, then the commissioner, told him he could "explore the full range of options" available to the Giants.</p>
        <p>"I never gave him permission to move," Vincent said the other day. "How could I? The leagues would have to have been involved. I gave him permission to look around. He went and made an agreement he clearly had no authority to make."</p>
        <p>Lurie has disputed Vincent's view of their meeting in New York last June, but no one else who attended that meeting has.</p>
        <p>"Lurie didn't follow a single guideline of the ownership committee," said one owner who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He had to get approval before making a deal and he didn't." The Smulyan Factor</p>
        <p>Other owners as well are not happy with Lurie for concluding a deal prematurely and not telling anyone about it, including the commissioner, until an agreement had been reached. They think he acted as he did to avoid the setback Jeff Smulyan suffered in being forced to sell the Seattle Mariners to a Japanese-led group in Seattle instead of moving the team to Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Lurie, preferring the Florida price of $115 million to the $100 million offered in San Francisco, has lobbied hard to induce his fellow owners to approve the move. The Tampa Bay people, desperate to finally get a team, have worked even harder to belittle the effort of the San Francisco group to buy the Giants.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco offer, the Florida people say, is not only $15 million less, but the financing is questionable and the stadium is still dreaded Candlestick. Moreover, they say, if the owners reject the Tampa Bay bid, the San Francisco group would very likely reduce its offer, leaving Lurie with no choice but to take whatever is left on the table.</p>
        <p>Peter Magowan, president of Safeway Inc., who would be managing general partner of the Giants if they remain in San Francisco, offered assurances in a letter to Bill White, the National League president, that the $100 million offer would not be lowered.</p>
        <p>"We're credible businessmen," Magowan said. "We don't welsh on deals. Bob Lurie has no reason to worry about our coming in with a low-ball offer." A Key Landlord</p>
        <p>Among Magowan's partners are Charles Schwab, chairman of the Charles Schwab &amp; Company brokerage houses; Donald Fisher, chairman and majority owner of the Gap stores, and Walter Shorenstein, manager and part owner of the Pan Am building in New York and owner of the Bank of America building in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The group plans to finance the deal through the Bank of America, which means financing should be no problem unless the bank doesn't like its landlord.</p>
        <p>As for the stadium, the group wants to build a new one using primarily private funds. In all four referendums that voters in the San Francisco region defeated, the stadium would have been built strictly with public money.</p>
        <p>"We cannot be perceived as taking money away from all these other deserving causes at a time when money is tight," Magowan said. "On the other hand, I think we can come up with innovative ideas to finance the stadium. This is no knock at Bob, but maybe we have more clout with the politicians and the business community than Bob did to raise funds and get this thing done on a private basis."</p>
        <p>If the owners signal their desire to have the Giants stay in San Francisco, Lurie would emerge with $15 million less, but there is another way to look at that difference.</p>
        <p>Before he was permitted to explore his options, Lurie said he would lose $15 million if the club had to play at Candlestick next season. By keeping the team where it is but allowing Lurie to sell, the owners would be saving him that loss, meaning he would emerge with the same net amount. A Double-Cross?</p>
        <p>Lurie has been described as being resentful about the San Francisco developments, but one major league official raised another point. "I wonder," he said, "how Lurie feels about the people who promised him they would make sure the Giants could move if he voted against the commissioner."</p>
        <p>If the Giants' move is to be blocked, it would be done in the National League, where four negative votes would accomplish that goal. The other two West Coast teams, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres, are expected to vote against a move. The Mets, the Houston Astros and the Montreal Expos (who would no longer exist if their previous owner had decided to get more money by selling out the city) are also viewed as believing that the Giants should leave not only their hearts but also their bats and balls in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>If Lurie loses and feels double-crossed, he might want to think about how Vincent felt a couple of months ago when Lurie joined the group trying to oust him after he had campaigned for a new stadium for Lurie. Mattingly's Error of Omission</p>
        <p>Don Mattingly still doesn't get it.</p>
        <p>As he has at other times in the past year or so, the Yankees' first baseman lamented the other day the absence of George Steinbrenner and eagerly looked forward to his impending return.</p>
        <p>Mattingly talked about the aura of excitement that used to surround the Yankees but no longer does. He talked about the "big bad Yankees" he used to play for."</p>
        <p>What Mattingly is missing, though, is perspective. What has happened to the Yankees since he began playing for them in 1983 is that Steinbrenner himself allowed the team to deteriorate through poor judgment and moves.</p>
        <p>When the man Mattingly yearns for was banished in 1990, the Yankees were already well on their way to their worst season record since 1913, well on their way to matching their longest span without a first-place finish since they started winning pennants in 1921.</p>
        <p>Players like Reggie Jackson, Dave Winfield and Mattingly created the aura Mattingly misses. Steinbrenner ran Jackson out of town prematurely. He traded Winfield prematurely. Mattingly fizzled prematurely.</p>
        <p>Unlike his earlier years, when he created that aura by lavishing lucrative contracts on free agents like Jackson, Winfield, Don Baylor, Rich Gossage, Tommy John and Catfish Hunter, Steinbrenner killed it the past decade by adding expensive players like Ed Whitson, Mike Witt, Pascual Perez, Dave LaPoint and Andy Hawkins.</p>
        <p>Mattingly should be able to remember the more recent group; all were his teammates. Needed: One More Division</p>
        <p>With so much attention focused on the size of player payrolls, the Player Relations Committee and the Players Association might want to reconsider the method they use to compute the payrolls.</p>
        <p>The committee, the owners' labor body, has determined that the Toronto Blue Jays had the biggest 1992 payroll, $49,127,166. Included in that total is David Cone's entire $4.25 million salary even though Cone earned only $887,363 of it with the Blue Jays.</p>
        <p>The committee and the union ignore division of salaries because of the bookkeeping that would be involved in keeping track of the portion of salary earned with a particular club. They keep it simple. If a player is on a team's Aug. 31 roster or disabled list, his whole salary is credited to that team.</p>
        <p>But if the salaries of Cone and Jeff Kent, for whom the pitcher was traded, were prorated for the time spent with each team, the Blue Jays would have had a payroll of $45,850,771, and the Mets would have been No. 1 with $47,170,729.</p>
