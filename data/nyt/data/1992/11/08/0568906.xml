        <p>There is another old way out. It worked brilliantly before, but the men you interviewed are much younger than I am and do not remember the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was run by Jesse Jones and credited by most economists with having done more to bring us out of the 1929 Depression than all the costly alphabetical agencies created. When liquidated, R.F.C. returned a profit to the Treasury.</p>

        <p>Re "Old Idea Gains New Respect: Spending Way Out of Slump" (front page, Oct. 8):</p>
        <p>There is another old way out. It worked brilliantly before, but the men you interviewed are much younger than I am and do not remember the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was run by Jesse Jones and credited by most economists with having done more to bring us out of the 1929 Depression than all the costly alphabetical agencies created. When liquidated, R.F.C. returned a profit to the Treasury.</p>
        <p>R.F.C. was financed by the Government, but its stock was always carried as an asset on the books. I suggest such a corporation now. It could be partly financed privately. It is desperately needed first to finance the hundreds of banks in trouble to bring them back to health. They then can return to lending badly needed funds to corporations for expansion, and thus more employment. This would be much cheaper for the taxpayer, who otherwise would have to foot the bill for failed banks.</p>
        <p>Such an agency could lend to new corporations formed for specific purposes. For instance, a corporation of engineers chartered to repair our bridges equals employment. Likewise one for nationally repairing our roads. FRED SAIGH St. Louis, Oct. 22, 1992</p>
