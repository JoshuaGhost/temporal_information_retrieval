        <p>T. Timothy Ryan Jr. today became the Bush Administration's first senior regulator since Election Day to announce that he would step down, leaving the post as the nation's top official overseeing the saving and loan industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan still had two years left in his term, but as a staunch Republican and loyal official in the Treasury Department, his resignation, effective next month, as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision took no one in Washington by surprise. Until Bill Clinton appoints a successor, the agency will be run by Jonathan Fiechter, one of Mr. Ryan's deputies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan, who is 47 years old, said in a telephone interview today from San Diego that he had not yet begun to look for another job and would make no employment decision before he left the agency on Dec. 4. Attending a Conference</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ryan elaborately choreographed the resignation announcement to coincide with an appearance at an industry conference that began today in San Diego, where he will no doubt be talking with savings executives and lawyers who might be interested in hiring him.</p>
        <p>On Friday Mr. Ryan told a few reporters that he had sent his resignation letter to President Bush after they had agreed not to report about the news until Sunday evening. The Office of Thrift Supervision then sent out unusual press packets proclaiming "O.T.S. Milestones" under Mr. Ryan that referred to his "innovative programs" and "regulatory reform."</p>
        <p>His tenure at the office was marred at the outset by a bruising confirmation battle in which his nomination survived the Senate Banking Committee scrutiny by the barest of margins, and only after heavy lobbying by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Opponents, most notably the committee chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, made an issue of Mr. Ryan's inexperience in the banking industry and his acknowledgement that he had tried cocaine in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Ryan's guidance, taxpayers paid for protecting nearly $200 billion in deposits in 22 million accounts of institutions in which the stockholders and bondholders were wiped out. Since shortly before he arrived, the agency closed, sold or liquidated more than 700 institutions with almost $400 billion in assets.  Frustration With Congress</p>
        <p>But since April, when the Government's spending authority for the bailout lapsed, the mammoth rescue has stalled and Mr. Ryan has regularly expressed his frustration with Congress, particularly Republicans in the House of Representatives who blocked consideration of legislation that would have provided more money for the bailout. That legislation is expected to be taken up again when Congress returns next year.</p>
        <p>Although he liked to assert that he was independent, Mr. Ryan almost never broke ranks publicly with Bush Administration officials, and for much of the final months of the election year he tried to help them by saying the savings bailout was almost finished. Today he said that new regulations taking effect on Dec. 19 were likely to require the recapitalization or seizure of about 100 more institutions holding assets of more than $60 billion.</p>
        <p>As one of the five members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Mr. Ryan also took up an election-year Administration cause by voting against the plan of that agency's chairman, William Taylor, to increase by 22 percent the premiums paid by banks for deposit insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said he feared that a smaller contribution from the industry would increase the chances of another large taxpayer bailout of the bank insurance fund, which already has a deficit of $5.5 billion and has begun to rely on huge loans from the Treasury.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Taylor died unexpectedly in August, the Treasury Department was able to exert greater control over the deposit corporation, and at Mr. Ryan's urging the agency ultimately backed down and approved a 10.8 percent rate increase and exempted three-quarters of the industry from any increase on deposit insurance.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ryan said that there were occasions when his decisions bore personal, as well as political, repercussions. He said some former political associates, whom he would not identify, had stopped talking to him after the Office of Thrift Supervision had decided to censure Neil Bush, the President's son, for his role as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver, one of the largest failures on record.</p>
        <p>"Because of Neil Bush, I was persona non grata," Mr. Ryan said. "At first I think it was because they did not want to influence me, and afterward I don't know why they did not talk to me."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan's tenure was criticized on one hand by those who asserted that he had taken too rosy a view of the industry's recovery, and on the other hand by those who said he had been too zealous in some enforcement actions. Some critics argued that he had come down hard against accounting and law firms that had worked for savings associations before they collapsed, and against savings executives, who were frequently stripped of their assets by the Government long before they got their day in court.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ryan reveled in the accusations that he was too tough and viewed it as part of his mission to regain the agency's regulatory footing after most experts agreed that the saving supervision unit's predecessor agency had been asleep or worse through much of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>He also understood that few in Congress would ever criticize him for coming down too hard on so many unpopular industry figures and on an industry whose mismanagement by some estimates will ultimately cost taxpayers $500 billion over 40 years.</p>
        <p>Perhaps his most controversial decision was to freeze the assets of a large New York law firm that had worked for Charles H. Keating Jr., the savings and loan operator now in jail who came to symbolize the excesses of the industry's heyday. The firm, Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, buckled and nearly collapsed after Mr. Ryan's decision and within days of the asset freeze agreed to settle the $275 million lawsuit for $41 million and other penalties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan succeeded M. Danny Wall and assumed control of the new agency in the spring of 1990, after it was reorganized by a Congress and Administration that blamed much of the industry's failure on a lax Federal Home Loan Bank Board that had neglected to regulate savings institutions adequately. Before his appointment he was solicitor general at the Labor Department and a lawyer for the Reagan transition team in 1980.</p>
