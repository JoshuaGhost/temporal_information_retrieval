        <p>A New York City police officer charged last June with the killing of a Brooklyn liquor store owner during a holdup has been indicted in another robbery, at an Upper East Side restaurant, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The arrest last June of Officer Robert Cabeza, 29 years old, of Queens, in the liquor store slaying, and the arrests a month earlier of six active and former police officers accused of drug dealing, prompted Mayor David N. Dinkins to appoint a panel to investigate police corruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabeza, a five-year police veteran assigned to the 83d Precinct in Brooklyn, was indicted on July 2 for second-degree murder, attempted murder and related charges in the Feb. 10, 1991, death of Man Sing Chan, 41. He has been held in jail without bail awaiting trial.</p>
        <p>The new, 22-count indictment accuses Mr. Cabeza of robbing 11 people in the One Fish, Two Fish Restaurant, at 1399 Madison Avenue, at 97th Street, on Aug. 24, 1991. As in the robbery of Mr. Chan's liquor store, Mr. Cabeza is said to have had an accomplice, whom law-enforcement officials have not yet identified.</p>
        <p>The investigation of Mr. Cabeza "is not put to rest," said Robert J. Beatty, Chief of the Police Department's Inspectional Services Bureau. "This guy has shown himself capable of killing people."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabeza's lawyer, Stuart London, dismissed the new charges as "grandstanding by the Manhattan D.A.'s office."</p>
        <p>Investigators did not link Mr. Cabeza to the restaurant holdup until after his arrest in June, when one of the victims recognized him from a newspaper photograph, Chief Beatty said.</p>
