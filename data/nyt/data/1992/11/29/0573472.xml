        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "The Payroll Tax Is Getting Out of Hand," Nov. 8), Norman Ornstein states that the Social Security payroll tax (F.I.C.A.) is ". . . the single largest tax burden on more than three-fourths of Americans." In fact, only 29 percent of those who pay Social Security tax pay more in F.I.C.A. tax than they do in Federal income tax. Mr. Ornstein's figure stems from an illogical comparison, weighing the Social Security tax paid by both employer and employee to the income tax paid by workers alone.</p>
        <p>His chief argument regarding the regressivity of the payroll tax ignores two very important facts. First, Social Security is a social insurance program -- 40 percent of today's benefits go to surviving spouses and children, as well as disabled workers and their dependents. Second, Social Security's benefit structure is highly progressive. Low earners are provided considerably higher benefits in relation to preretirement earnings -- and F.I.C.A. taxes paid -- than high earners.</p>

Mr. Ornstein's figure stems from an illogical comparison, weighing the Social Security tax paid by both employer and employee to the income tax paid by workers alone.</p>
        <p>His chief argument regarding the regressivity of the payroll tax ignores two very important facts. First, Social Security is a social insurance program -- 40 percent of today's benefits go to surviving spouses and children, as well as disabled workers and their dependents. Second, Social Security's benefit structure is highly progressive. Low earners are provided considerably higher benefits in relation to preretirement earnings -- and F.I.C.A. taxes paid -- than high earners.</p>
        <p>Taking the example Mr. Ornstein provided, let's compare the F.I.C.A. taxes and potential Social Security benefits of two workers -- one earning $10,000 annually and the other earning $100,000 annually. In addition to the substantial disability and survivor insurance protection each has while working, the estimated monthly retirement benefit payment at age 65 would be about $500 for the lower earner and about $1,000 for the higher earner. Even with the F.I.C.A. tax not levied on earnings above $55,000, the high earner will pay more than five times the F.I.C.A. taxes of the low earner but only receive twice the payment rate at retirement! If you are going to talk about a "regressive" F.I.C.A. tax, you must also examine the "highly progressive" benefit computation formula.</p>
        <p>I raise these issues because I need to insure that any discussion regarding Social Security edifies, and does not confuse, the public and that it does not undermine the confidence that the American people have in their Social Security program. LOUIS D. ENOFF Baltimore, Nov. 18</p>
        <p>Louis Enoff is Acting Commissioner of Social Security</p>
