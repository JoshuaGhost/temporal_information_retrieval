        <p>The sweep of the home-and-home series with the Devils was clean as a whistle for the Penguins. They had very little trouble both nights, with a 2-0 triumph tonight following a 4-1 trouncing in New Jersey a night earlier.</p>
        <p>Jaromir Jagr had a short-handed goal and Ron Francis scored on the power play against Chris Terreri, who played very well in his first start in five games.</p>
        <p>Terreri made 27 saves and was almost as good at Tom Barrasso at the other end, except that Terreri's teammates were slightly less effective in their attacking zone. 12th Victory for Goalie</p>
        <p>Barrasso was the beneficiary in goal for both games in the series for the Penguins. His victory Friday night was his 12th of the season and broke the franchise record for most victories in a career by a Pittsburgh goaltender.</p>
        <p>Denis Herron had the record with 88 victories during his three different stints with the Penguins. Barrasso's victory tonight was his 90th and he evidently has several years left with the Penguins.</p>
        <p>Barrasso's most difficult moments tonight came in the last period, but he met the challenge every time to preserve his second shutout of the season and help the Penguins achieve the best start in their history.</p>
        <p>Their record of 15-4-3 is the best in the league and the best after 22 games in the history of the Penguins, who captured the Stanley Cup the last two years. The Penguins also extended their home unbeaten streak to 20 games.</p>
        <p>Coach Herb Brooks of the Devils admitted afterward that some parts of his team, particularly his proven goal scorers of the past, are fairly ineffective right now.</p>
        <p>"We're not putting the puck away," Brooks said, "and we have to do something to get them going."</p>
        <p>Brooks came short of naming his goal scorers, but it was obvious that John MacLean and Stephane Richer were the first two names on his mind as he spoke in a hallway outside the Devils' dressing room.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most daring experiment by Brooks was using MacLean at left wing on a line with newly-promoted David Emma at center and Claude Lemiuex on the right.</p>
        <p>By moving Lemieux, Brooks broke up the team's first line that had Peter Stastny centering for Zdeno Ciger on the left and Lemieux, whose place was taken by Richer.</p>
        <p>MacLean, who missed all of last season with reconstructive surgery in his right knee, has only two goals for the year and both came in a 4-3 overtime victory at Hartford Oct. 28.</p>
        <p>Richer is getting plenty of ice time from Brooks and he has been unable to pay back any dividends for that reward. He has putting himself in position to score, but he has been missing the target and has only five goals for the season.</p>
        <p>Brooks uses Richer at the point on the power play and Richer can be deadly with his ferocious shot from there. But the flamboyant Richer has also been a liability in handling the puck at the blue line and in his zone.</p>
        <p>Richer lost the puck in his zone to Francis during a power play for the Devils on that brought Pittsburgh's first goal. Francis took a shot from the right circle that Terreri knocked away to his right. Unfortunately for Terreri, Jagr was the only one there for his short-handed goal with 1:54 left in the first.</p>
        <p>The goal by Francis came 9 minutes 11 seconds into the middle period during a manpower advantage for the Penguins. Although the power-play goal was only the second in the last 19 chances for Francis and his teammates, the Penguins are still ranked first in the league in power-play efficiency.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DOUG BROWN of the Devils continues to be under suspension without pay for refusing to report to the minor leagues. He cleared waivers last Monday and he is trying to find a team. The Hartford Whalers, who were reportedly interested in Brown, filled their void at right wing Saturday by selectimg JAIME LEACH of the Penguins on waivers. . . . DAVID TIPPETT of the Penguins suffered a fractured right thumb in Friday night's game against the Devils and is out indefinitely.</p>
