        <p>May I add some footnotes to the "Jerseyana" article about Joyce Kilmer and Hobey Baker:</p>
        <p>Kilmer remains a remarkable man. The poet-soldier joined the New York Seventh Regiment two weeks after the declaration of war in 1917. Although exempt (married with four children), he happily transferred to Douglas MacArthur's crack National Guard regiment, which became the famous "Rainbow" (A.E.F. 42d) Division.</p>

        <p>May I add some footnotes to the "Jerseyana" article about Joyce Kilmer and Hobey Baker:</p>
        <p>Kilmer remains a remarkable man. The poet-soldier joined the New York Seventh Regiment two weeks after the declaration of war in 1917. Although exempt (married with four children), he happily transferred to Douglas MacArthur's crack National Guard regiment, which became the famous "Rainbow" (A.E.F. 42d) Division.</p>
        <p>As a member of the "Fighting 69th," he was killed in action at the Bois Colas (70 miles from Paris) at the side of his commander, Lieut. Col. William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan, who later wrote:</p>
        <p>"We were lying together along the Bois Colas. Machine gun fire was coming down the draw from the village of Sergines. A bullet hit him full in the head killing him instantly. Not only did Sergeant Kilmer find a soldierly joy in the conflict and actually seek danger, but he was a cool headed soldier . . . full of eagerness at all time to give his full measure of service."</p>
        <p>The Joyce Kilmer Commission will remember him at his birthplace in New Brunswick on Joyce Kilmer Avenue, Friday, Dec. 4, at 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>He is buried in the American Cemetery near the Bois Colas. Theodore Roosevelt, whose son Quentin was killed in the same battle, joined the Kilmer family in their wish that he should remain where he fell (rosary clutched in hand) and wrote that whatever "has been erected by friends" should not be disturbed. Requiescat in Pace. DONALD F. X. FINN Chairman, World War I Historians Millington</p>
