        <p>It's not easy being a first woman, especially when your debut in a preseason National Hockey League game catapulted your name and face far and wide.</p>
        <p>As a result, MANON RHEAUME, now a backup goalie with the minor league Atlanta Knights, has her hands full these days. For one thing, Rheaume (pronounced ray-OME) has a daunting schedule of daily practice, extra drills and rigorous exercise, including aerobics, six different kinds of sit-ups and an extensive weight-lifting program. "It's not to become big," said the 5-foot-6, 135-pound goalie, "but to make my muscles stronger."</p>

        <p>As a result, MANON RHEAUME, now a backup goalie with the minor league Atlanta Knights, has her hands full these days. For one thing, Rheaume (pronounced ray-OME) has a daunting schedule of daily practice, extra drills and rigorous exercise, including aerobics, six different kinds of sit-ups and an extensive weight-lifting program. "It's not to become big," said the 5-foot-6, 135-pound goalie, "but to make my muscles stronger."</p>
        <p>With the Knights off to a division-leading start in the International Hockey League, Rheaume has yet to play in a regular-season game, but her first-woman fame has kept her busy giving interviews, posing for pictures and wading through an avalanche of mail. Some of it, predictably, is from women's groups wanting her to speak. Some of it, even more predictably, is from admiring men.</p>
        <p>If some things never change, some things, it seems do. While Rheaume understands that "it's special that a girl's playing with the boys," she is pleased that the boys she plays with have gotten beyond that. "They don't see me like a girl with the boys," she said. "They see me like a player with other players." (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY</p>
