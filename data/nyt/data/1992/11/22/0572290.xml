        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If, as Jon Pareles says, Sinead O'Connor is driven by "the conviction that her private problems are the world's concern," then his assertion that the singer would have "thought twice about tearing up a photograph of Louis Farrakhan or the Lubavitcher Rebbe" is completely irrelevant.  These are not her personal problems.  Ms. O'Connor's protest is a generalization about the continuing damage caused by the Catholic Church, based on her personal experiences.</p>

        <p>As someone who had to fight his way out of the enveloping and equally hurtful grip of the Mormon Church, I understood immediately what Ms. O'Connor was saying, and why. I may or may not choose to express myself in the same way. But I would stand by her a thousand times over. The Church can protect itself; many of its victims cannot.
