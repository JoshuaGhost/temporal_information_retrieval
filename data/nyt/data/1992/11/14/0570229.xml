        <p>Human presence is tenacious; it survives even in the wired heart of the computer-chip world. The debut on Tuesday night at Limelight of the Communion tour, which takes the club's weekly "spiritual technology" dance scene to 23 cities across the nation, exemplified the odd combination of self-loss and self-awareness common among the denizens of the alternative dance scene.</p>
        <p>The headliners Meat Beat Manifesto failed to make it past United States Customs in time for the show (the entire bill is rescheduled for Dec. 1 at the same location; tickets for Tuesday's show will be honored). The groups Orbital and Ultramarine shared the beat-conjuring duties instead. Ultramarine opened with an ambient house set. The trio crafted billowy layers of samples from new-age philosophers, California folkies and British art rockers, laced with a dose of jazzy organ. Bobbing to their own rhythms like happy junior scientists, the three scrubbed young fellows were appealing, but hardly offered a show. Yet the audience -- especially the shy boys whose misfit styles most resembled the band's -- kept their attention on the stage as they swayed and applauded at each perfunctory break in the music.</p>

The groups Orbital and Ultramarine shared the beat-conjuring duties instead. Ultramarine opened with an ambient house set.

        <p>The disjunction between anticharismatic performers and desirous audience was even more extreme during Orbital's two sets. Phil and Paul Nartnoll play buoyant rave grounded in techno beats. Unlike many techno acts, Orbital successfully tempered its speediness with gentle excursions into soulful melody. Dancers bobbed in narcissistic bliss. Still, despite the music's seduction away from rational mind states, the crowd remained facing forward, watching the absence of a show onstage. It seems that habits formed watching rock shows retain their hold even in sonic cyberspace.</p>
