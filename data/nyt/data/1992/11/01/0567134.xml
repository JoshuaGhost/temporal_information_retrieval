        <p>Throughout history, the most outrageous and romantic forms of fantasy furniture have flourished when the economy sagged and dreams flourished. In the late 1930's, for example, Helena Rubinstein acquired a flamboyant suite of shell-shaped furniture for her New York apartment. And in 1938 Jean-Michel Frank, the French decorator, commissioned Salvador Dali to design a sofa shaped like the mouth of Mae West for the showroom of Schiaparelli, the Paris couturiere.</p>
        <p>"Fantasy furniture is more popular now than it's ever been," said Bruce M. Newman, a New York dealer and collector of such exotica. He and his wife, Judith, have written a book on the subject, "Fantasy Furniture," and they have recently donated 16 exuberantly embellished pieces to the Brooklyn Museum, where they are now on permanent exhibition.</p>

        <p>Throughout history, the most outrageous and romantic forms of fantasy furniture have flourished when the economy sagged and dreams flourished. In the late 1930's, for example, Helena Rubinstein acquired a flamboyant suite of shell-shaped furniture for her New York apartment. And in 1938 Jean-Michel Frank, the French decorator, commissioned Salvador Dali to design a sofa shaped like the mouth of Mae West for the showroom of Schiaparelli, the Paris couturiere.</p>
        <p>"Fantasy furniture is more popular now than it's ever been," said Bruce M. Newman, a New York dealer and collector of such exotica. He and his wife, Judith, have written a book on the subject, "Fantasy Furniture," and they have recently donated 16 exuberantly embellished pieces to the Brooklyn Museum, where they are now on permanent exhibition.</p>
        <p>The collection includes five types of fantasy furniture from the 19th century. The Venetian grotto style is represented by a curvaceous shell chair and a table with a dolphin-shaped base. The Black Forest style -- surprisingly all such furniture is Swiss, not German -- is typified by a bench flanked by two robustly carved bears.  From Germany comes a lethal-looking smoking stand in the horn-and-antler style. Also from Germany there is a table designed for calling cards, on which a leering beast appears to be chewing up the top; the piece is an example of the mythological style.</p>
        <p>The most romantic objects from the collection are a pair of nymph-embellished Art Nouveau chairs, carved in France at the turn of the century in the Belle Epoque style.  The silvered wood seats simulate lily pads, the backs large leaves and the legs thick clusters of sturdy vines.  "These chairs are so sinuous they seem alive," Mr. Newman said.</p>
        <p>Also from the Belle Epoque period is a far more restrained French plant stand, with a wrought-iron frame that suggests vivid red and green branches, leaves and flowers.</p>
        <p>A carved mahogany dragon chair is a tour de force of undulation. The dragon's tail forms a headrest, its exposed spine the back and its grinning face the footrest. "The creature is smirking," Mr. Newman said. "When you look at that chair, you feel decadent. If you sat on it, you'd hurt yourself. It was never meant for sitting. Some British lord with a sense of humor may have commissioned it to stand in the corner of his library -- daring someone to try it."</p>
        <p>Peacocks probably inspired the Florentine craftsman Andrea Baccetti to carve the splendid feather-surfaced chair and table on view and to paint them red, silver and peacock blue. After completing the table, which has a treelike base, he added a pair of peacocks to the top, carved so that their tails and beaks are joined. The chair is shaped like a peacock, too, its wings spread to form the seat, its tail feathers the fanlike back and its long legs the feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman said that he first realized how witty and enchanting fantasy furniture can be during a visit in 1950 to the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, the country mansion built and extravagantly furnished by the man who later became George IV of England. "I thought it was the surrealist land of Oz," he said. "The Prince Regent, who built the place, certainly had a sense of humor."</p>
        <p>And presumably so did Ludwig II, the Bavarian aristocrat with a taste for the bizarre in palaces and furnishings. "These two men gave people in the 19th century a license to live a fantasy life," Mr. Newman said.</p>
        <p>According to Kevin Stayton, the museum's curator of decorative arts, the ambiguity of fantasy furniture is part of its charm. Among the exhibition's images open to interpretation is the layered detailing on the legs of a silvered Austrian chair. Mr. Stayton sees them as feathers, Mr. Newman as leaves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stayton is also unsure as to what is depicted on the vigorously carved calling-card stand. "The gargoyle figure may be an insect, beast or dragon," he said. "Not knowing exactly what the image is blurs its reality and increases its attraction."</p>
        <p>His favorite piece in the collection is a late-19th-century Japanese desk with a three-dimensional rendering of mountains, pavilions and a bridge in cinnabar lacquer. "By replacing the desk's superstructure with a dream landscape," Mr. Stayton said, "something new and mysterious was created."</p>
        <p>The collection represents a delightful addition to the Brooklyn Museum's holdings. "We had lots of technologically innovative pieces from the period but nothing as engaging as these pieces," Mr. Stayton said. "Most people view the 19th century as straitlaced and somber. This collection is chock full of whimsy, which helps us understand that the Victorians were human, too."</p>
        <p>And it appeals to people of all ages, even the very young. "My 7-year-old nephew saw the show's brochure," Mr. Stayton said, "and asked me to buy some of it for him for Christmas."  ARTS/ARTIFACTS</p>
