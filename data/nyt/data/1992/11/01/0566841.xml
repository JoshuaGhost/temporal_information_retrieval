        <p>A heavy police presence, swarms of civilian patrols and a dusk-to-dawn curfew combined on Friday night in Camden, N.J., to prevent a recurrence of a Halloween-eve arson spree that plagued the city in 1991.</p>
        <p>"It went tremendously," the Camden County Prosecutor, Edward F. Borden Jr., said yesterday about the all-night surveillance plan. "It was quieter than the average Friday night. It was just great."</p>
        <p>Mr. Borden, who helped organize and direct the crackdown, said there were fewer than 20 fires of all kinds during the night, known as Mischief Night. In the Oct. 30, 1991 arson rampage there were more than 130, he said.</p>
        <p>"Our goal was to cut the number of fires by 25 percent," he said. "We cut it by over 80 percent." Citizens' Street Patrols</p>
        <p>Most fires on Friday were in trash bins, empty lots or abandoned cars, Mr. Borden said. "There were less than 10 structure fires," he said. Only one occupied building, a corner grocery store, burned, and investigators said yesterday that they believed it had started accidentally, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Borden attributed the success of the program to about 800 Camden residents who fanned out on street patrol from various community centers. Many of the volunteers served in the plan's "adopt a house" program and stood watch throughout the night outside homes.</p>
        <p>"The level of visible community support made the difference," he said.</p>
        <p>The residents carried flashlights and wore fluorescent green caps and T-shirts emblazoned with a red heart and the slogan: "Do Camden Right, Stop the Fires on Mischief Night." Mr. Borden said he had bought the lights and clothing with $11,000 confiscated from drug dealers. Modeled After Detroit</p>
        <p>Camden, which is New Jersey's poorest urban area, fashioned the program after one adopted by Detroit to counter its rash of Halloween Eve fires in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>About 300 of Camden's 360 police officers were on duty throughout the night, mostly on street patrol, Mr. Borden said. They were supported by 75 officers from the County Sheriff, 50 investigators from Mr. Borden's staff and a state police contingent. Two National Guard helicopters and another from the state police flew over the city for much of the evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Borden said 50 youths were given summonses for violating the program's special, one-night 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. curfew. Yesterday, Camden resumed its regular 11 P.M. to 6 A.M. curfew for youths ages 5 to 17.</p>
