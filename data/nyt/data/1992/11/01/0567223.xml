        <p>MOVING MOUNTAINS</p>
        <p>Lessons in Leadership and Logistics From the Gulf War. By William G. Pagonis with Jeffrey L. Cruikshank. Illustrated. 248 pp. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.</p>
        <p>HAVING kept American forces well supplied during the Persian Gulf war, Lieut. Gen. William G. Pagonis now offers corporate America lessons in innovative management. "Moving Mountains: Lessons in Leadership and Logistics From the Gulf War" is not a modest book. General Pagonis maintains that, in effect, his achievements as the leader of a huge Army logistics team rank him among the nation's more imaginative and effective top executives.</p>
        <p>Military memoirs, in his view, are no longer the preserve of combat commanders like General Grant or General Eisenhower or, most recently, General Schwarzkopf. Supplying military expeditions in the post-cold war era is also heroic, he believes, and the Army's performance in the gulf is evidence that America is supreme in that field. "Our logistical successes in the gulf war," General Pagonis writes, "suggest to me that our colleagues in the private sector may now get some good guidance from us." In the 19th century European generals came to this country to learn something about moving and supplying large, complicated forces by observing P. T. Barnum's maneuvers with his vast circus. Now American industry, the general suggests, should look not only to Japan and Germany for lessons in efficiency, but also to the United States Army.</p>
        <p>That would be quite a spinoff victory from the gulf war, if it were true. But while General Pagonis is clearly an effective executive, his management precepts are already known to corporate America, or should be. More than a decade of self-analysis and self-criticism for having lost the industrial lead to Japan and Germany has produced a huge volume of literature on how to manage workers, reorganize and inspire them, and how to keep strategic goals simple and flexible.</p>
        <p>"Moving Mountains," written with Jeffrey L. Cruickshank, a communications consultant, is a bracing review of these lessons, even offering an original management tool: 3-by-5 cards, each with a handwritten message, that General Pagonis and his corps used by the thousands to keep information flowing rapidly. But such management agility is now standard in corporate America, and "Moving Mountains" is far from being a breakthrough book.</p>
        <p>Disconcertingly, General Pagonis shifts back and forth from memoir to management textbook, with the latter occupying two-thirds of the book. The memoir is more vivid, anecdotal and instructive. For months William (Gus) Pagonis was billed in the news media as the logistics genius who, as head of the Army's 22d Support Command, had fed, housed and equipped more than half a million American troops on short notice. As he notes, moving that large a force and all its equipment was like moving the whole state of Alaska and everything in it around the globe and then keeping it going. How did he do it? General Pagonis offers a broad outline, but starves his readers for detail.</p>
        <p>One lesson comes through loud and clear. Saudi Arabia turned out to be a well-equipped and friendly staging area for a war. When the general arrived with a skeleton staff, he rented Saudi buses to transport the thousands of troops piling up on airport tarmacs without a clue about what to do next. And he secured 10,000 Bedouin tents to help house them.</p>
        <p>The greatest feat, getting so many Americans and so much ammunition and equipment from the United States to Saudi Arabia in a few weeks, is not the subject of this book, and that is disappointing. Others managed this aspect of the operation; the general and his men -- a corporate work force, so to speak, that reached 50,000 people -- handled the distribution within Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>And for all their organizational skills, they might have failed if the Saudis had not made available deep-water ports with excellent docks and huge warehouses, fresh food and thousands of trucks and buses that were rented, each with a driver, from the Philippines, Korea, Turkey or Bangladesh. The same war, staged from a much less friendly country like Jordan or Syria, might not have made the 51-year-old General Pagonis such a management hero.</p>
        <p>MOVING tanks hundreds of miles to the front line, for example, was a major problem. Under their own steam, the tanks would have torn up the asphalt highways or burned too much fuel and created too many maintenance problems. General Pagonis urgently needed big transport trucks, and the Army had only 112 in Saudi Arabia. "We were able to assemble a fleet of nearly 1,300 H.E.T.'s  [ heavy equipment transporters ]  and tractor trailers, most of which came equipped with experienced third-country national drivers," the general reports. And on to the next problem.</p>
        <p>Zahir Mastri, a friend of King Fahd, solved General Pagonis's fresh-food problem. As the general tells the story in an amusing section of the book, troops waiting months in the desert for the war to start required a diet that went beyond dry Army rations, and Mr. Mastri's company, Astra Foods, operated the largest covered farm in the world. Soon Astra Foods and the Pagonis team had mess halls everywhere as well as mobile fast-food canteens, with King Fahd paying most of the bill. King Fahd, the good Arab host, had sent Mr. Mastri to the Americans.</p>
        <p>A successful company, of course, is not only efficient but profitable. The gulf war's urgency saved General Pagonis from budget constraints, and the Army's buying power was a magnet not only for Saudi merchants but also for suppliers in neighboring countries. "Word spread like wildfire that the American military was paying in Saudi riyals -- a desirable currency -- and that payment was made every two weeks," General Pagonis writes. "Since the Saudi Government was in the habit of paying its vendors only once or twice a year, we were suddenly the favorite clients on the block."</p>
        <p>And in the end it is that buying power that makes Army executives, even those as skilled as General Pagonis, less than credible as management gurus.</p>
