        <p>SOMETIMES pairing two ingredients yields a dish that is far greater than the sum of its parts. Lay a piece of puff pastry over a poached salmon fillet, and you have a special event. Add a few slices of black truffles to a steak sauce, and it becomes memorable. Toss a few chunks of duck sausage on a pizza, and it becomes a national trend.</p>
        <p>Such is the case with the major ingredients in this recipe, although I hardly predict it will become a national trend. The recipe, which I recently devised, could have gone in several directions. The crab meat and the ham could have been combined and then made au gratin, or I could have made sandwiches using the bread. Instead, I gave the ingredients a more elegant presentation by arranging the crab meat and the curry sauce over slices of country ham and toasted French bread. The visual effect is more dramatic, and the dish has an elegance it would otherwise lack. Still, it's quick and easy to prepare.</p>

        <p>Such is the case with the major ingredients in this recipe, although I hardly predict it will become a national trend. The recipe, which I recently devised, could have gone in several directions. The crab meat and the ham could have been combined and then made au gratin, or I could have made sandwiches using the bread. Instead, I gave the ingredients a more elegant presentation by arranging the crab meat and the curry sauce over slices of country ham and toasted French bread. The visual effect is more dramatic, and the dish has an elegance it would otherwise lack. Still, it's quick and easy to prepare.</p>
        <p>This is a rich combination, to be sure, yet I like the way the sweet crab plays off the salty ham. A good prosciutto is relatively mild and faintly nutty, while American country hams pack more salt. Keep this point in mind when seasoning the crab sauce.</p>
        <p>I recommend a light, fresh side dish, like string beans with garlic, olive oil and chives. A simple green salad, perhaps with a good balsamic vinaigrette, would also cut the richness of the crab. Creamed Lump Crab Meat With Country Ham  1 pound lump crab meat or Dungeness or king crab 2 tablespoons butter 2 teaspoons curry powder 4 tablespoons chopped scallions, white only 4 tablespoons dry sherry  1/2 cup heavy cream  1/2 cup half-and-half 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten in a small bowl 4 slices of country bread or French bread, about 1/4 inch thick, toasted or fresh 8 thin slices country ham like prosciutto, Smithfield or Black Forest 4 lemon wedges for garnishing.</p>
        <p>1. Pick over the crab to remove any traces of shell or cartilage.</p>
        <p>2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy skillet. Add the curry powder and the scallions. Cook, stirring, until wilted. Add 2 tablespoons of the sherry and cook briefly.</p>
        <p>3. Add the cream, half-and-half and Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Set aside. Keep warm.</p>
        <p>4. In a nonstick skillet, heat the remaining butter, and add the crab meat and the remaining sherry. Heat briefly without stirring, and remove from the heat.</p>
        <p>5. Add 1/4 cup of the hot cream mixture to the egg yolks. Stir well with a whisk to blend. Return this mixture to the sauce, stirring rapidly. Remove from the heat.</p>
        <p>6. Spoon the sauce over the crab meat.</p>
        <p>7. Preheat the broiler and prepare the toasts.</p>
        <p>8. Heat the ham under the broiler and place the toasts on serving dishes. Add the ham slices. Top with the crab meat and the cream sauce, dividing evenly. Serve with lemon wedges.</p>

String Beans With Garlic  1 pound string beans, trimmed 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon butter 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Bring 2 cups salted water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the beans, bring the water back to a boil and simmer 6 to 8 minutes. The beans should be crisply tender. Do not overcook. Drain.</p>
        <p>2. Place the oil and butter in the same saucepan. Add the garlic and cook briefly. The garlic should remain white. Add the beans and chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss to blend. Serve immediately with the crab meat.</p>
