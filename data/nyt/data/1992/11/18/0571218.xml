        <p>The Household Finance Corporation sold $518.3 million of asset-backed certificates in two parts yesterday through Morgan Stanley &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The certificates were issued through a Home Equity Loan Trust 1992-2, with $466.5 million of class A certificates and $51.8 million of class B certificates, both with an average life of 2.53 years. The collateral behind the certificates is home-equity loans.</p>
        <p>For the class A certificates, the coupon is 6.65 percent at a price of 99.53125 to yield 6.798 percent, or about 190 basis points more than a combination of yields on two-year and three-year Treasury notes. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>The class B certificates, with a 6.85 percent coupon, are priced similar to the class A to yield 6.999 percent, or about 210 basis points more than the combination of two- and three-year Treasuries.</p>
        <p>Underwriters said that because of an insurance policy issued by MBIA Inc. the certificates are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service, the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and the Duff &amp; Phelps Rating Company.</p>
