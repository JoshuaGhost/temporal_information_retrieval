        <p>HISPANIC Heritage Month ended recently. But someday -- if some "Hispanics" are to be made happy -- it may be Latino Heritage Month. Or perhaps Colombian-Dominican-Cuban-Mexican-Puerto Rican-and-Other Heritage Month.</p>
        <p>The month dedicated to celebrating the contributions of those nationalities to the United States -- and coinciding with the anniversary of Columbus's voyage -- sparked anew the debate about just what to call the 22.4 million American residents who said they were of "Spanish/Hispanic Origin" on the 1990 Census.</p>
        <p>Some feel the Census Bureau imposed the word "Hispanic," and prefer "Latino." Younger people in some cities, especially, find Hispanic archaic, if not downright offensive, much as "Negro" displeased a previous generation of blacks or African-Americans. They say it recalls the colonization by Spain and Portugal and ignores the Indian and African roots of many people it describes. Yet others, including business and political leaders, dismiss "Latino" as a fad. Still others use the terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably.</p>
        <p>Among those who grew up hearing "Latino" or "Latina" used often in their neighborhoods and homes, especially in the Southwest, it rolls off the tongue with a Spanish tinge (lah-TEEN-oh), its very pronunciation an affirmation of identity. By comparison, the word closest to Hispanic that exists in the Spanish language is hispano (ees-PAN-oh), or Spanish-speaker, its initial consonant silent in current Spanish pronunciation.</p>
        <p>"To say Latino is to say you come to my culture in a manner of respect," said Sandra Cisneros, the author of "Woman Hollering Creek: And Other Stories," who refuses to have her writings included in any anthology that uses the word Hispanic. "To say Hispanic means you're so colonized you don't even know for yourself or someone who named you never bothered to ask what you call yourself. It's a repulsive slave name."</p>
        <p>Not so, insists Enrique Fernandez, the editor of Mas, a Spanish language entertainment magazine. In fact, he says, Latino taken to its roots refers to "an even older empire. That's the one that took over Spain." What, he asks, does Latino have to do with "Hispanics, Africans and native Americans"?</p>
        <p>Ana Celia Zentella, a linguistics professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, traced the origins of the word Hispanic to "Hispania," a Phoenician word for "land of rabbits" that was used by the Romans during their conquest of the area that includes modern-day Spain. She uses Latino among others like herself, and Hispanic on grant proposals, but has found a growing push for Latino, which sometimes, she says, smacks of political correctness.</p>
        <p>"Language is a smokescreen for other fundamental underlying problems," she said. Wave away the smoke and there remains, in her view, an issue at once simple and complex. And, yes, political. Ms. Cisneros, who grew up in Chicago using the word Latino at home, says the choice of words is a rapid sign of "what side of the line" a person stands on. In this analysis, "Hispanic" connotes social striving, a desire to be accepted at any cost, even by using an "English" word.</p>
        <p>For Ricardo Salinas, a member of the comedy theater troupe Culture Clash, the argument over terminology is fodder for a skit in which an Americanized Hispanic picks a fight with a "Latino" by calling him an Hispanic. "It's the ultimate assimilation, with that word," he said.</p>
        <p>According to Jorge del Pinal, the chief of ethnic and Hispanic statistics at the Bureau of the Census, the bureau began grappling during the 1970's with how best to describe the diverse groups which had been called "Spanish-speaking" or "Spanish-surnamed."</p>
        <p>"Not all the people we considered Hispanic spoke Spanish," Mr. del Pinal said. "Not everybody had a Spanish surname." As a result, he said, the final category came to be designated "Spanish/Hispanic Origin," preferably used in tandem. "It was just really a way to come up with a term to fit this amorphous group," he said. "It really came right out of the dictionary."</p>
        <p>Herman Badillo, at the time a Congressman from New York -- and a founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus -- said the move was cheered among the nation's various Hispanic communities, who stood to gain more political representation and Government  services as a result of the designation.</p>
        <p>Raul Yzaguirre, the president of the National Council of La Raza, a national civil rights organization, said he also pressed for "Hispanic." He chafes at the criticisms of those who deride it as politically incorrect. "The last thing in the world I want to do is fight over what we call ourselves," he said. "We really need to get beyond that."</p>
        <p>In a recent national survey of Hispanic political attitudes, researchers may have found a key to the issue: Most Hispanics/Latinos prefer to identify themselves as Puerto Rican, Colombian, Dominican or just plain American.</p>
        <p>"The intelligentsia engaged in a political debate that had no resonance among the people," said Rodolfo de la Garza, co-author of the study and a professor in the department of political science and government at the University of Texas at Austin. The larger question suggested by the study was whether a label for the larger group is useful at all in characterizing a population that is not monolithic.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in Miami there are bumper stickers that proclaim "No soy hispano, soy Cubano" (I am not Hispanic, I am Cuban), a sentiment echoed among other groups loath to see their achievements and struggles vanish in the swirl of the melting pot.</p>
        <p>"It's expected in a city of immigrants," said Lisandro Perez, the director of the Cuban Research Center at Florida International University. "They find out they're Hispanic when they get here. The mega-label is widely used in the United States, but people have an identity of where they migrate from."</p>
        <p>For years, John Leguizamo, the part-Colombian, part-Puerto Rican writer and actor now starring in his one-man off-Broadway show, "Spic-O-Rama," simply called himself Spanish, a word whose noble connotations glossed over mainstream society's discomfort over the influx of new arrivals.</p>
        <p>As someone whose show's title takes a slur and transforms it into the root of a slew of positive words, he does not find "Hispanic" offensive.</p>
        <p>"I don't consider it a negative term. Now 'wetback, greasy spic' --</p>
        <p>that's</p>
        <p>derogatory," he said.</p>
        <p>But he prefers Latino, saying its warmer feel unites him with his contemporaries from his Queens childhood who hailed from Puerto Rico, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. "When you're together and in your groove, I don't feel the difference," he said.</p>
        <p>If anything, he said, he rejoices and identifies with the successes of his counterparts, whether they be Colombian, Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Rican. "I feel an intense pride well up," he said, revealing his New York roots in a way that is truly pan-ethnic: "I kvell."  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
