        <p>AS with most holiday meals, the traditions of Thanksgiving are decidedly durable. But this year, with the publication of the nutritional pyramid that recommends from 6 to 11 servings of bread and grain, 3 to 5 of vegetables and 2 to 4 of fruit each day, the many side dishes that accompany turkey have assumed even greater importance.</p>
        <p>And it may be time to consider revising recipes for classic accompaniments.</p>

        <p>AS with most holiday meals, the traditions of Thanksgiving are decidedly durable. But this year, with the publication of the nutritional pyramid that recommends from 6 to 11 servings of bread and grain, 3 to 5 of vegetables and 2 to 4 of fruit each day, the many side dishes that accompany turkey have assumed even greater importance.</p>
        <p>And it may be time to consider revising recipes for classic accompaniments.</p>
        <p>There are a variety of delicious ways to prepare sweet potatoes, for example, that do not require copious quantities of brown sugar, butter and marshmallows. Perhaps whole roasted and glazed onions can replace the dish of creamed onions.</p>
        <p>By paying more attention to the preparation of green vegetables like broccoli and kale, these side dishes might actually serve a function beyond adding a bit of color to the plate. A savory sweet-and-sour chutney is almost as easily made as the usual heavily sugared cranberry sauce.</p>
        <p>Turkey stuffing provides an opportunity to offer some helpings of real grains, not merely toasted chunks of stale white bread.</p>
        <p>And for dessert, the pumpkin for one pie is a vegetable and the apple for the other is a fruit.</p>
        <p>The challenge, in this department, is finding a way to reduce the amount of fat in the pastry. One possibility is to make an apple cobbler with just a top crust. Another is using pumpkin pie filling to make a flan with no crust at all. Brown Rice And Pecan Stuffing</p>
        <p>Total time: 45 minutes plus roasting</p>
        <p>1 cup chopped pecans  2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter  1 1/2 cups chopped onion  1 cup chopped celery  1 teaspoon dried thyme  2 teaspoons dried sage  2 cups raw brown rice  3 1/3 cups turkey or chicken stock  2 tablespoons chopped parsley  1 teaspoon lemon juice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Toast the pecans by tossing them over medium-high heat in a heavy, dry skillet or baking them in a toaster oven until golden brown. Do not allow them to burn. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan. Add the onion and celery and saute over low heat until soft and just beginning to brown. Stir in the thyme, sage and rice. Add the pecans. Add the stock, bring to a boil and boil for two minutes. Lower heat, cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. The rice will still be a little firm, but it will continue cooking when it is stuffed into the poultry.</p>
        <p>3. Season the mixture with parsley, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use to stuff the turkey. When stuffing, do not pack the mixture tightly because the rice will continue to expand.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 8 cups, enough for a 12-pound turkey. Curried Sweet Potato Puree</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour, 15 minutes plus reheating</p>
        <p>6 medium-sized sweet potatoes, about 4 pounds, scrubbed  2 tablespoons butter  1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  1 tablespoon curry powder  1 cup nonfat milk  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  2 teaspoons ground cinnamon.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Prick the sweet potatoes in several places. Put them in the oven and bake them until they are tender, about 50 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, heat one tablespoon of the butter in a large, heavy saucepan, stir in the ginger and cook a minute or two. Add the curry powder, cook, stirring a minute or so longer, then stir in the milk. Heat the milk until steaming but not boiling. Remove the mixture from heat and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. When the potatoes have finished baking, scoop the insides out of the shells and mash them by putting them through a potato ricer or by using a potato masher.</p>
        <p>4. Reheat the milk mixture in the saucepan and transfer the sweet potato puree to the saucepan. Mix all the ingredients together and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>5. Brush a 4-to-6-cup baking dish with half the remaining butter. Spread the puree in the baking dish. Dot the top with the remaining butter and sprinkle with the cinnamon. Set aside until 30 minutes before serving time. Refrigerate if the puree is made the day before.</p>
        <p>6. Before serving, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the baking dish in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings. Kale With Garlic And Raisins</p>
        <p>Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 cup golden raisins  1 cup warm cider  2 bunches kale  3 tablespoons olive oil  4 cloves garlic, minced  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons cider vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. Place the raisins in the cider and allow to soak about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, rinse and drain the kale. Remove any very heavy stems, and chop the kale coarsely.</p>
        <p>3. Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add garlic and saute over medium heat until barely golden. Add the kale and stir-fry over medium heat until it begins to wilt, about five minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Stir in the raisins and the cider. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until the kale is just tender, about five minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in the cider vinegar. Serve at once or set aside for up to 30 minutes, then reheat briefly before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
