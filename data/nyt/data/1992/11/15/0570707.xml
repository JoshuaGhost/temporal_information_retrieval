        <p>During their third straight defeat tonight, the Rangers sent a different sort of message: The problem might not be too many good players, but at least one too few.</p>
        <p>Sadly lacking a mobile third defenseman capable of making the clearing pass or the quick backcheck, the Rangers committed homely, slow-motion errors that led to three first-period goals by Quebec and a 6-3 defeat at the Colisee.</p>
        <p>As Neil Smith looked on with increasing discomfort, the Rangers failed to mark or backcheck or do anything to remotely suggest they were prepared to snap out of their growing, 2-5-2 slump. Still Working on a Deal</p>
        <p>The Ranger general manager was back on the road with the team after scouting Winnipeg, Minnesota, Edmonton and Calgary. Smith insisted he was not yet close to the inevitable deal for a defenseman who can move the puck out of his own end, behind Brian Leetch and James Patrick on the depth chart. But Smith is busy, working at it.</p>
        <p>"Every time we lose another game," Smith said, with a trace of gallows humor, "the number of players we're trading goes up one."</p>
        <p>John Vanbiesbrouck, returning to the net after missing four games with a groin injury, was offered a rude reception by the Nordiques, and by his teammates. Three defensive breakdowns -- by Jay Wells, Jeff Beukeboom and Joe Cirella -- led to three first-period goals by the Nordiques. Just as ominously, there was no backchecking forward in sight on any of Quebec's goals. In their three straight losses, the Rangers have given up 18 goals.</p>
        <p>"We had some mental breakdowns again out there," said defenseman Mark Hardy. "I didn't think we played that bad, but somehow we managed to get our butts kicked." Clumsy and Clutching</p>
        <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that Cirella and Wells, both clumsy with the stick, are not a good blue-line match. Beukeboom, who was sent off tonight for two minor penalties, has grown too dependent on the clutch and hold.</p>
        <p>Wells allowed Mats Sundin to gather a pass behind him and head alone into the slot to beat Vanbiesbrouck on a power-play goal at 6 minutes 6 seconds into the game.</p>
        <p>Beukeboom made a judgmental error, leaving Owen Nolan alone in the crease to chase Mike Hough behind the net. Hough threw the puck in front of the net, as might have been expected, and Nolan deposited it behind Vanbiesbrouck for a 2-1 Quebec lead.</p>
        <p>Again the Rangers tied, and again they gave back the lead goal. This time, Cirella lost the puck in the Nordiques' defensive zone to Sundin, who had clear ice ahead of him all the way to Vanbiesbrouck. The goaltender made the first save, but Scott Young came in unchecked on the right side to flip in the rebound at 15:17. 2 Goals on Deflections</p>
        <p>After earning their bad breaks for much of the game, the Rangers suffered two unlucky deflections in the second and third periods. Young, skating short-handed down the right side, knocked a soft shot at Vanbiesbrouck that glanced off the boot of Patrick, who was returning to action after a shoulder injury, and was misdirected past the goalie for a 4-2 lead.</p>
        <p>Kerry Huffman's shot at 7:19 of the third period found Leetch's skate in the same manner, for a three-goal lead.</p>
        <p>By then, a last bit of hope had dissolved when the Rangers frittered away a two-man advantage for 1:43 during the third period. Quebec goaltender Ron Hextall made several remarkable reflex saves during this span, and the Nordiques had a dangerous scoring opportunity of their own.</p>
        <p>It was a ludicrous exclamation point to the long night, which still promised a quiet charter flight home.</p>
        <p>"We're not as bad off as the score indicated," Vanbiesbrouck said. "We're grown men, we can work through this. It's just a little adversity." SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The third straight defeat equaled the Rangers' longest losing streak from last season. . . . BILL LINDSAY was awarded Quebec's sixth goal in the third period after a replay showed his body had inadvertently knocked the puck into the Ranger net. . . . Last year, the Rangers spent both Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve in Winnipeg. Again this season, NEIL SMITH approved the idea of being on the road for those holidays, and the schedule is only a bit kinder. The Rangers will be traveling between games in Pittsburgh and Minnesota on Thanksgiving, and will be in Buffalo for a New Year's Eve game. "Thanksgiving doesn't matter," Smith reasoned, since the Canadian Thanksgiving falls on Nov. 1. "And we had good luck last year after playing on New Year's, so we've got to keep it up." Last year, the Rangers beat the Jets, 5-2, in Winnipeg. Smith will somehow be forced to miss Buffalo, because he will in Sweden watching the World Junior Championships at the time.</p>
