        <p>NOT many galleries have gone into business with bunting and a Grand Opening sign. But then, Waterside Art Studios is an unusual gallery staking its claim in virgin territory -- to wit, the area in back of the Stamford waterfront that is mostly warehouse-type buildings, rough ground and chain-link fencing. Though hardly a SoHo in the making, the section has a touch of the industrial panache that is catnip to artists -- and not lost on its developer, Murray Goldblum.</p>
        <p>Whereas landlords have traditionally tolerated artists until such time as they have improved the tone of the neighborhood and can be replaced by wealthier tenants, they now seem to be encouraging them. For instance, the owners of the old Lorillard tobacco building in Jersey City are not only renting to artists but also giving them the run (for the time being) of a space for exhibitions, the better to magnetize more tenants.</p>

        <p>NOT many galleries have gone into business with bunting and a Grand Opening sign. But then, Waterside Art Studios is an unusual gallery staking its claim in virgin territory -- to wit, the area in back of the Stamford waterfront that is mostly warehouse-type buildings, rough ground and chain-link fencing. Though hardly a SoHo in the making, the section has a touch of the industrial panache that is catnip to artists -- and not lost on its developer, Murray Goldblum.</p>
        <p>Whereas landlords have traditionally tolerated artists until such time as they have improved the tone of the neighborhood and can be replaced by wealthier tenants, they now seem to be encouraging them. For instance, the owners of the old Lorillard tobacco building in Jersey City are not only renting to artists but also giving them the run (for the time being) of a space for exhibitions, the better to magnetize more tenants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldblum, however, wants it all -- that is, he remains a developer and the owner of, among other local companies, Stamford Wrecking Company's Office Furniture Outlet Inc. But he also presides over the warehouse divided by white partitions into long, long aisles that is Waterside, where he displays signs advertising studio space. Noting that he brings "nothing but ambition" to this task, Mr. Goldblum, who vaguely resembles Andy Griffith in the "Matlock" television series, told a reviewer that he even chose some of the works in the gallery's inaugural show.</p>
        <p>Still, the entrepreneur knew to leave the bulk of the jurying to Sue Collier, whose drawing class at the State University of New York in Purchase he attends as a beginner, and Cindy Rosnoy, manager of the Whitney Museum branch in the Champion Building. Robert Metzger -- a former director of both the Stamford Museum and Nature Center and the Aldrich Museum and currently head of the art and science museum in Reading, Pa. -- weighed in as the show's curator and will continue to serve as artistic adviser.</p>
        <p>Considering the number of chefs in the kitchen and that, as Mr. Goldblum himself remarked, "one of them is a house wrecker," the results are not at all bad. Even so, a show involving 50 artists, some of them with booths to themselves, is not easily reviewed and, when hung in a 12,500-square-foot space relentlessly illuminated by fluorescent, it becomes a virtually review-proof supermarket of art (numbering the aisles would have helped). There are several familiar names, including Reuben Nakian, Robert Andrew Parker and the illustrator Alan Cober. But the majority are, critically speaking, strangers or casual acquaintances to this observer.</p>
        <p>Imagery ranges from the hyper-realistic -- black chalk drawings of nudes by Nancy Depew -- to the nonobjective -- the geometric abstractions of Debra Mintz and Elizabeth Morris -- and includes photographs that also run to extremes. On the one hand, there are Yorghos Kontaxis's large color prints that could prompt immediate reservations for the Aegean. They have everything -- brightly painted fishing boats, stucco the color of terra cotta, see-through water, faces as weathered as driftwood and, above all, devastating white light. On the other hand, there are Marilyn Silberstang's monochromatic photo-etchings and gravures that have next to nothing yet rivet the attention, especially the grainy shot of a kitchen with pictures askew on the wall above tubular furniture.</p>
        <p>Jim Bouler, another photographer in black and white, tries a bit too hard for Surrealism, especially in the nudes under polyethylene pinned down by pipe joints. But he succeeds in "Sleeping Gypsy," which, named after the Rousseau painting, focuses on a nude reclining under newspapers by the "light" of a painted moon. Also Surrealist is George Soppelsa's tiny photo-collage of a baroque arcade under a pink cloud shaped like a face at each end. Mr. Soppelsa also contributes a landscape with a tiny man in suit and hat leaping from one sculpture to another, both of them Easter Island in scale but classical in their lineaments.</p>
        <p>To the question, how many men armed with rifles and mounted on bicycles does it take to kill one small black dog? The answer is five, and Alexander Shundi supplies it in "Execution of the Dog Tell." An aerial view illustrating a true story, it shows the action taking place on a tessellated piazza in Parma, as a gray-haired woman protests -- successfully, as it turns out. Gerald Saladyga shows canvases in various styles. "Requiem for Marsden Hartley" is a flatly painted emblem involving three circles, one containing a crucifix against a Maine landscape, another an incised head of Hartley and the third of an Iron Cross appropriated from his German period. The expressionistic "Descent From the Cross" features a lone figure painted upside down a la Georg Baselitz.</p>
        <p>Enid Munroe contributes several bland but not unpleasing landscapes in high-keyed hues applied so smoothly as to appear sprayed. Though it seems unsporting for jurors to include their own work, Ms. Collier's loosely brushed, heavily-patterned interiors with figures certainly provide painterly relief. So do Jerrald Balance's abstractions in black, green and gray enamel on plexiglass -- melting Rothkos. Still, one of the most memorable paintings is Kathy Ruttenberg's interior by lamplight in which two stylized figures sit close, she in a patterned armchair with her back to the viewer, he leaning forward to clasp her face.</p>
        <p>Other artists to look out for include James Grashow and Ora Lerman. Mr. Grashow is represented by several woodcuts, tinted and plain, that feature plants with blossoms composed of tiny buildings and one of a tree with leaves similar to shoe trees -- the whole thing bound rather sadistically to a chair with ropes, straps and chains. Ms. Lerman, who seems distantly related to the Chicago Imagists, shows large watercolors like "The Attic of Sidliko," where carved, polychromed animals have at one another in a room with a view of a Kremlin-style dome.</p>
        <p>Last but not least are the etchings, lithographs and screen prints of Lester Johnson. Earlier examples depict the artist's monochrome choruses of bowler-hatted men maneuvering in tight formations and later ones their multicolored female counterparts -- dewey-eyed beauties with abundant hair. Mr. Johnson is an artist who needs no introduction but there are plenty in the show who do -- and many works that could use dates.</p>
        <p>All things considered, the opening is indeed grand and the venture positively heroic. The reviewer, nevertheless, looks forward to a more focused policy, like two or three small shows at a time. Not all 12,500 of the square feet have to be used at once, unless, of course, the dealer is aiming for a trade-show effect.</p>
        <p>The opening show at Waterside Art Studios, 77 Selleck Street, Stamford, remains through Dec. 31.</p>
