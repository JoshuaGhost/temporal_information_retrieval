        <p>"SMOKEY BEAR: concerned citizen or pyromaniacal busybody? On the next 'Donahue.' "</p>

        <p>While such provocative television promotions are somewhat far-fetched, the Advertising Council, which ministers to Smokey and scores of other national public-service campaigns, is exploring a significant overhaul of its marketing strategies.</p>
        <p>To supplement its conventional appeals in formats like 30-second television spots and print advertisements, which received the equivalent of $1.1 billion worth of donated time and space last year, the organization is about to enter the realm of the so-called new media like talk shows, MTV, program-length commercials and interactive computer information services.</p>
        <p>Such a change would be drastic for the council, which in 50 years of operations has become known for a somewhat conservative way of doing business. Yet the rationale is that if Presidential candidates can break with tradition and reach the public through unconventional methods, so, too, could public-service pitches.</p>
        <p>"If the public sees that as advertising, we should be there," Ruth A. Wooden, president of the Council in New York, said. "It sure worked for Ross Perot."</p>
        <p>A primary benefit to entering the new media, Ms. Wooden continued, is that "a lot of what we do is targeted to young adults, 'Generation X.' " Ms. Wooden was citing a term popularized by the author Douglas Coupland to refer to a generation of twentysomethings who prefer the new media to the old.</p>
        <p>Another selling point, she said, is that many of the new opportunities in broadcast media run longer than traditional commercials.</p>
        <p>"The idea of being able to do a half-hour, which gives us the chance to give out a telephone number 20 times instead of only once or twice, is a great opportunity," she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wooden listed several of the council's initial forays into the new media:</p>
        <p>* A 30-minute "infomercial," as a program-length commercial is known, to promote a forthcoming campaign called Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage, aimed at improving health and educational services for children living below the poverty line.  "We'd prefer not to call it an infomercial," Ms. Wooden said. "We're calling it a P.S.A. documentary," using the initials for public-service announcement.</p>
        <p>* A campaign on the environment being developed for and by the Prodigy Services Company joint venture of I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck, for its interactive personal computer network; subscribers could ask questions about recycling, say, and receive answers instantly.</p>
        <p>* Appearances on talk shows, MTV and other programs by representatives of the council to discuss new projects.</p>
        <p>For instance, Ms. Wooden said, a mediagenic spokesman for Breaking the Cycle, like a young man who teaches kindergarten in New York, could "go out to talk shows and tell what it's like to have kids arrive in kindergarten ready or not ready" to learn.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wooden acknowledged that any decision by the council to participate in the new media might be problematic, particularly if it chose to run infomercials.</p>
        <p>The growing interest of the council in the new media also reflects a broadening of its list of priority projects to tackle problems that are more contentious, and tougher to solve, than its familiar, widely popular efforts like encouraging seat-belt use or recycling.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Breaking the Cycle campaign, the council is also about to introduce ads that discourage discrimination and hate crimes and others that try to persuade young men to urge their pregnant wives or girlfriends to seek prenatal care.</p>
        <p>The council concludes a yearlong commemoration of its 50th anniversary at a dinner in Manhattan tomorrow night, presenting the 39th annual Advertising Council Award for Public Service to Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive at the Colgate-Palmolive Company.</p>
