        <p>School custodians in New York City spend precious little time mopping the floors, but a distressing number of them work at private jobs on school time or use school money for their personal expenses.

        <p>School custodians in New York City spend precious little time mopping the floors, but a distressing number of them work at private jobs on school time or use school money for their personal expenses. That shocking indictment of the custodians and of the Board of Education's failure to monitor them is contained in a report issued last week by Ed Stancik, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for city schools.</p>
        <p>New York's 915 custodians function as both city employees and independent contractors, at an average annual salary of $58,000. Each custodian administers an annual budget for supplies, equipment and salaries for a custodial staff.</p>
        <p>Custodians enjoy astonishing control over their schools, with an appalling lack of responsibility. They are required to clean classrooms only every other day and cafeterias once a week. They are required to mop floors only three times a</p>
        <p>year</p>
        <p>. And they can charge fees for opening schools after 6 P.M. for children's and community programs.</p>
        <p>What do custodians</p>
        <p>do</p>
        <p>? Mr. Stancik's investigators found one custodian who spent hours tending to his boat while being paid to take care of a Board of Education facility in Brooklyn. Another pursued a second career as a charter pilot -- on school time. Others commingled public funds in their personal accounts, used school funds to pay off debts, or hired friends or people with criminal records.</p>
        <p>Beyond individual transgressions, Mr. Stancik rightly blamed the custodial system, which he said "facilitated the wrongdoing." That includes the board's custodial supervisors, who have not exercised effective oversight. Mr. Stancik recommends that principals be given more control over custodians, the practice in many other jurisdictions. He also suggests that custodians account to the Board of Education for budget and personnel.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Joseph Fernandez has already dismissed two custodians cited for wrongdoing. In contract negotiations, he has sought to make custodians more responsible to principals and to increase their productivity. He has hired private contractors in 33 schools to perform custodial services.</p>
        <p>The Stancik report now gives Mr. Fernandez more reason to bring custodians under control.</p>
