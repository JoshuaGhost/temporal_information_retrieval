        <p>For John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, the hard part is just beginning. By the end of the year, G.M. has said it will name four more assembly plants to be closed as part of its strategy to cut its excess capacity.</p>
        <p>The four plants will be in addition to the G.M. mini-van plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Willow Run in Ypsilanti, Mich., where full-size rear-wheel-drive cars are built. These plants were named earlier in the year when G.M. announced 12 of 21 assembly and parts-making factories it planned to close. These were on top of earlier G.M. closing announcements affecting factories like those in Scarborough, Ontario, and the West plant in Pontiac, Mich.</p>

        <p>For John F. (Jack) Smith Jr., the new chief executive of the General Motors Corporation, the hard part is just beginning. By the end of the year, G.M. has said it will name four more assembly plants to be closed as part of its strategy to cut its excess capacity.</p>
        <p>The four plants will be in addition to the G.M. mini-van plant in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Willow Run in Ypsilanti, Mich., where full-size rear-wheel-drive cars are built. These plants were named earlier in the year when G.M. announced 12 of 21 assembly and parts-making factories it planned to close. These were on top of earlier G.M. closing announcements affecting factories like those in Scarborough, Ontario, and the West plant in Pontiac, Mich.</p>
        <p>Predicting the new plants likely to be closed has grown increasingly difficult, industry experts said, as the company has shifted production of models in a way that eliminates some options. "One must question how serious G.M. is about closing facilities," said Clifford J. Swenson, manager of production forecasting for Jacobs Automotive, a consulting firm in Little Falls, N.J. "They have not been overly aggressive." Three at Great Risk</p>
        <p>G.M. officials and the United Automobile Workers union declined to comment, but Mr. Swenson pinpointed three plants with the greatest risk of being closed: one of the two plants in Oshawa, Ontario, that build mid-size cars like the Chevrolet Lumina; one of three plants that build full-size pickup trucks in Oshawa, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Pontiac (at the East plant), and a Detroit plant that builds truck and motor-home chassis.</p>
        <p>Beyond those three, however, a surprise seems in store, perhaps on the order of the stunning news in February when G.M. abruptly announced it would close its only plant that makes mini-vans and instead build a new version at a plant in Doraville, Ga.  The big surprise may be that G.M. will have to drop well-known models.</p>
        <p>It labored over consolidating its rear-wheel-drive car production in Arlington, Tex., or Ypsilanti before Arlington won out, but some experts question whether G.M. should continue to build the large sedans at all.</p>
        <p>Maryann N. Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York, said the large Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster models were not making money for G.M. because many were sold to fleets with little or no profit.</p>
        <p>To complicate things, G.M. seems to have eliminated some alternatives.  G.M. once had the option of consolidating production of large, front-drive cars from three plants to two.</p>
        <p>The ones to stay open under that move, Mr. Swenson had predicted, would be Flint, Mich., and Wentzville, Mo., while the plant in Orion Township, Mich., would be closed. But G.M. has said it will shift Oldsmobile 88 production to Orion, which will also build updated models of the Buick Riviera and Oldsmobile Toronado.</p>
        <p>Also, its Linden, N.J., and Moraine, Ohio, assembly plants looked like candidates for the padlock but G.M. has signaled that it will reopen the Linden plant to produce a new small pickup truck. Moraine has been promised a new paint system, a hint that it may stay in business.</p>
        <p>The willingness of the U.A.W. to be more flexible may also be an important factor as G.M. considers which plants to close.</p>
        <p>A nine-day strike in late August by workers at a G.M. parts plant in Lordstown, Ohio, led to costly shutdowns of nine assembly plants, including the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn.</p>
        <p>Strikes can wipe out any savings that the company may be able to wring from suppliers as part of its mission to cut costs.</p>
        <p>In another possible move, Corvette production might be shifted from a low-volume plant in Bowling Green, Ky. One option might be to move the Corvette to Ste. Therese, Quebec, where G.M. makes other sports cars. But making the Corvette, an American icon, outside the United States is difficult to picture. "But then again," Mr. Swenson said, "a new day may be dawning at G.M."</p>
