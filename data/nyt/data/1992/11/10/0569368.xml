        <p>FOR years, researchers have known that dolphins use sonar beams to navigate the murky depths of the ocean.</p>
        <p>Now researchers at the University of California at Santa Cruz are using a computer model to study how the skull and a network of air sacs inside a dolphin's head act as an acoustical mirror to focus sonar beams.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by James Aroyan, a graduate student in physics at the university, Dr. Ted W. Cranford of the Naval Ocean Systems Center in Hawaii, Dr. Joel Kent of Elographics Inc. in Fremont, Calif., and Dr. Kenneth Norris, a retired professor of natural history at the university. The results of their study are reported this month in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.</p>
        <p>Using a CT scan of the common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, Mr. Aroyan and Dr. Cranford created a two-dimensional computer model of the interior of a dolphin's head. By altering the position, sound speed and density of the anatomical structures in the model, the researchers concluded that the skull and air sacs played the central role in the formation of sonar beams.</p>
        <p>"The skull is basically a mirrored surface, and the air sacs cover much of that surface," Mr. Aroyan said. "The skull and air sacs appear to be acting in concert as an acoustical mirror, reflecting the sound into highly directed forward beams."</p>
        <p>Mr. Aroyan's model indicated that although the "melon," a fatty, football-shaped region in the dolphin's forehead, may serve to "fine focus" sound waves already reflected from the skull and air sacs, it was not the primary focusing mechanism.</p>
        <p>The study also suggested that a dolphin may not use its larynx to produce the high-frequency clicks that guide it through the water. A region of fat and connective tissue just below the blowhole, referred to by Dr. Cranford as the "monkey lip/ dorsal bursae" complex, may act "like the vibrating lips of a trumpet player" to generate the dolphin's sonic pulses, Mr. Aroyan said.</p>
