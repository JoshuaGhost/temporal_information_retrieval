        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "A Chief of Staff? Forget It" (Op-Ed, Nov. 10) Jack Valenti argues that Bill Clinton should refrain from appointing a chief of staff because of problems with previous chiefs. His major argument is that the chief of staff becomes an unelected deputy President. Because of this, it is likely that the person will become a poor filter for the multitude of ideas being debated in the White House. In the process, resentment builds in the White House over the growing power of the chief of staff.</p>

        <p>In "A Chief of Staff? Forget It" (Op-Ed, Nov. 10) Jack Valenti argues that Bill Clinton should refrain from appointing a chief of staff because of problems with previous chiefs.

In the process, resentment builds in the White House over the growing power of the chief of staff.</p>
        <p>The problems of many chiefs provide evidence to support Mr. Valenti's argument. He says Mr. Clinton should not fill the position.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, why not appoint Al Gore chief of staff? As Vice President, he has a legitimate claim to be deputy President. Since Al Gore and Bill Clinton seem to share outlooks on many things, Mr. Gore's selection would be a natural. Most important, it would transform the office of the Vice President. That wouldn't be a bad outcome. DANIEL HOFRENNING Assistant Prof. of Political Science St. Olaf College Northfield, Minn., Nov. 11, 1992</p>
