        <p>In another move to shore up its sagging finances, the General Motors Corporation notified its 9,000 dealers today that its General Motors Acceptance Corporation unit would no longer provide wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. models sold by dealers who also sell General Motors cars.</p>

        <p>In another move to shore up its sagging finances, the General Motors Corporation notified its 9,000 dealers today that its General Motors Acceptance Corporation unit would no longer provide wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. models sold by dealers who also sell General Motors cars.</p>
        <p>Separately, G.M.'s Cadillac division said it was dropping its Allante two-seater luxury roadster next year, after a seven-year run in which it often fell short of Cadillac's, and owners', expectations.</p>
        <p>The current level of wholesale and retail financing for non-G.M. cars amounts to about $6 billion, or 10 percent of G.M.A.C.'s $60 billion in worldwide automotive financing.</p>
        <p>"Given our performance and the fact we're struggling on several fronts to be more productive," said John Rines, president of G.M.A.C., "we're focusing our assets primarily on G.M. products." Mr. Rines said he had spoken to about 30 dealers, "and my impression is this won't cause a big commotion." 2,000 Dealerships Affected</p>
        <p>A significant number of G.M. dealers also own non-G.M. franchises. A G.M. spokesman said about 2,000 dealerships nationwide would be affected, though banks and other financial institutions probably would be able to replace G.M.'s financing.</p>
        <p>G.M. said its decision on retail financing would become effective Jan. 1 and on wholesale financing on March 1. The auto maker will continue to provide financing for non-G.M. used cars.</p>
        <p>G.M. said its decision had been prompted by lowered credit ratings on its commercial paper, which are like corporate i.o.u.'s, and the prospect the ratings could fall further. "We want to make sure we prudently manage any liquidity risks," the G.M. spokesman said.</p>
        <p>If G.M.'s credit ratings on commercial paper were to fall further, the auto maker might be shut out of that market, forcing it to borrow at a more expensive rate elsewhere. Thus, G.M. might not be able to lend except at rates that would preclude it from making money or might cause G.M. to lose money.</p>
        <p>G.M. currently has borrowings of about $20 billion in the commercial paper market, down from about $28 billion last year, the spokesman said. A 'Luxury They Could Ill Afford'</p>
        <p>In eliminating of the Cadillac Allante, Cadillac said the car was profitable but that sales of the $62,000 car had slowed with the sluggish economy. And the expensive manufacturing process -- undercarriages made in Detroit and flown to Italy, where the Pininfarina-built bodies and interiors are installed and flown back to the United States -- is out of step with the new management's eagerness to improve efficiency and focus on high-volume products.</p>
        <p>"It was another luxury they can ill afford," said Thomas M. Dukes, director of competitive assessment for J. D. Power &amp; Associates, an auto marketing consultant.</p>
        <p>The Allante announcement disappointed many Cadillac dealers, who noted that the model brought additional business. But the car never created the halo with which Cadillac had hoped to illuminate the entire division. A Roof That Annoyed</p>
        <p>The Allante's problems included a convertible roof that leaked and created bothersome wind noise. The manually operated roof was also a struggle for many owners, who believed the top on such an expensive car should operate with the push of a button. The newer models are semiautomated but still require manual help.</p>
        <p>"I don't like to spend that kind of money and have a half-manual top," said Joel Must, president of Detroit City Dairy, who owned one before trading it for a Cadillac Seville.</p>
        <p>Allante production has fallen since the 1987 model year, when 3,363 Allantes were made. In the first 10 months of 1992, Cadillac sold 1,844 Allantes, a 26 percent drop from the corresponding period in 1991. When it was introduced, Cadillac said it was prepared to build 7,800 of the luxury cars a year.</p>
        <p>Although Cadillac introduced many technological innovations in the Allante, including its Northstar V-8 engine in April, the roadster did not measure up to many competitors in its handling and other performance characteristics. Mr. Dukes said the car's boxy body and square, button-laden dashboard also did not appeal to many consumers, who in general seem more taken with the flowing lines of many European and Japanese models.</p>
