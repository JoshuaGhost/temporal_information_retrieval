        <p>The Washington Ballet resembles a fine chamber-music ensemble. With 16 regular members and 3 apprentice dancers, it is not a large company. But, like chamber-music players, these dancers have established a remarkable rapport with one another, as was evident when they appeared on Tuesday night at the Performing Arts Center of the State University College here.</p>
        <p>The credit for maintaining this high level of performance surely goes to Mary Day, the Washington Ballet's artistic director, and the staff she has assembled. The present professional company, which was founded in 1976, is the outgrowth of various school and nonprofessional groups Miss Day has headed since the 1950's. Miss Day is nationally known as a teacher, and among her distinguished former students is Kevin McKenzie, the new director of American Ballet Theater.</p>

        <p>The Washington Ballet resembles a fine chamber-music ensemble. With 16 regular members and 3 apprentice dancers, it is not a large company. But, like chamber-music players, these dancers have established a remarkable rapport with one another, as was evident when they appeared on Tuesday night at the Performing Arts Center of the State University College here.</p>
        <p>The credit for maintaining this high level of performance surely goes to Mary Day, the Washington Ballet's artistic director, and the staff she has assembled. The present professional company, which was founded in 1976, is the outgrowth of various school and nonprofessional groups Miss Day has headed since the 1950's. Miss Day is nationally known as a teacher, and among her distinguished former students is Kevin McKenzie, the new director of American Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>As a director, Miss Day has always encouraged choreographers. The Washington Ballet's repertory was dominated by the works of Choo-San Goh, a Singapore-born choreographer, until his death in 1987. He was represented at Purchase by his "Birds of Paradise," created in 1979 to Alberto Ginastera's Concerto for Harp and Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The birds of this striking plotless ballet are unmistakably wild. The dancers did not merely leap through the air, they seemed to tear it apart with their arms and legs. Often, they looked predatory. One scene, led by Francoise Thouveny, Christoper Doyle, Lynn Cote and John Goding, could have been a mating ritual. And the finale's burning intensity made "Birds of Paradise" a celebration for a flock of firebirds.</p>
        <p>Ray Barra, a former member of Ballet Theater who has also worked with German companies, contributed a gentler abstraction. His "Dumky Variations" began and ended with dancers stepping pensively forward across a stage which Tony Tucci's lighting designs bathed in an autumnal haze.</p>
        <p>A pas de deux for Janet Shibata and Mr. Goding contrasted moments when the dancers nestled together as if for security with archings outward that could have symbolized longings for independence. There were also some tempestuous sequences for Runqiao Du. But even when the choreographic tempo quickened, Mr. Barra implied that the young people he depicted were always cloaked in melancholy.</p>
        <p>He thereby honored the spirit of the accompanying music, Dvorak's Piano Trio in E minor ("Dumky"), Op. 90. It was played live by the Orchestra of St. Luke's Trio: Eriko Sato, violinist; Daire Fitzgerald, cellist, and Donna Lee Weng, pianist. Based on the structure of a Slavic folk form known as the dumka, the score constantly alternates slow and fast sections. Each is lovely. But this, in effect, is a trio in which the same kinds of musical things keep happening over and over.</p>
        <p>Choreographically, Mr. Barra failed to make all of his incidents equally compelling, and there were moments when "Dumky Variations" appeared to repeat itself rather than develop. Nevertheless, its overall wistfulness was appealing.</p>
        <p>Christian Holder, a former member of the Joffrey Ballet, grappled with formidable dramatic complications in "Coup d'Estoc," which he choreographed to recorded pieces by Mozart. The ballet's title is an archaic French phrase meaning "thrust of the sword," and its plot derives from "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," the 18th-century novel by Choderlos de Laclos about the attempts of two decadent aristocrats to corrupt innocent young people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holder piled incident upon incident until the narrative became almost unintelligible. Yet the ballet commanded attention, thanks to Mr. Holder's use of gesture. He made his characters converse without ever uttering a word. The way stiff, formal gestures were interrupted by rapid flutterings conveyed a sense of sophisticated and possibly heartless banter and repartee. But when the characters expressed genuine emotions, they did so with simpler and more direct movements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goding was especially convincing as the urbane Vicomte de Valmont. Mr. Holder, who designed as well as choreographed the production, indicated several changes of locale simply by raising and lowering a few curtains. "Coup d'Estoc" was a flawed experiment. It was also an interesting one.</p>
