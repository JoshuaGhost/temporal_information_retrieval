        <p>Newark officials yesterday unveiled an unusual new approach that they said would cut into the rash of car thefts that have plagued the city.</p>
        <p>They announced the creation of a new team of police officers who will use non-lethal paint guns to pelt escaping cars with globs of blue or yellow fluorescent paint so the cars can be easily spotted later. The officials urged residents to call the police whenever they spot a vehicle with a telltale paint blob.</p>
        <p>The idea, said Mayor Sharpe James and William R. Celester, the Newark police director, was to counter the epidemic of car thefts without having to shoot at the drivers of fleeing cars or risk the lives of officers attempting to keep up with car thieves racing through crowded streets.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said the new undercover team of 25 specially trained officers would emphasize nonviolent tactics such as paint guns, defensive driving and anti-terrorist techniques.</p>
        <p>Driving expensive, late-model cars, the new team would spread out through the city hoping to catch car thieves in the act. It would also use a helicopter on loan to the city to follow fleeing stolen cars.</p>
        <p>Mayor James said the team, the Tactical Auto Recovery Group and Enforcement Team, also would have cellular telephones and mobile data terminals that would allow officers to determine instantly if a car has been stolen.</p>
        <p>Mr. James said the new team would also go from school to school discussing the risks of auto theft and warning that laws being considered in New Jersey would result in long prison terms for thieves.</p>
