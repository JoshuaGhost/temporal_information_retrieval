        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a faithful reader, I was taken aback by the tone and content of "Canada, Still Divided," your Oct. 28 postreferendum editorial. You seem to chide Canadians for rejecting the Charlottetown Accord, a series of amendments that proposed fundamental changes to the Canadian Constitution. You imply that alienation from politics and an unwillingness to accommodate the views of others were the only reasons that led more than 54 percent of Canadians to reject this "good compromise."</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a faithful reader, I was taken aback by the tone and content of "Canada, Still Divided," your Oct. 28 postreferendum editorial. You seem to chide Canadians for rejecting the Charlottetown Accord, a series of amendments that proposed fundamental changes to the Canadian Constitution. You imply that alienation from politics and an unwillingness to accommodate the views of others were the only reasons that led more than 54 percent of Canadians to reject this "good compromise."</p>
        <p>The accord was a poorly written document. It tried to address the very real grievances of native people, Quebec nationalists and the Canadian West. Because of the distrust among these groups, the accord affirmed their grievances while offering them no means to address their concerns.</p>
        <p>The accord's first section, "Unity and Diversity," states that it is "the role of the legislature and government of Quebec to preserve and promote the distinct society of Quebec." Another part of the same section affirms just as unequivocally that "Canadians confirm the principle of the equality of the provinces at the same time as recognizing their diverse characteristics."</p>
        <p>Anyone walking down the street in Montreal knows Quebec is different from the English-speaking provinces. One wonders why it is necessary to state that Quebec's government has permission to promote that "distinctness" if it has no more powers to do so than the government of any other province. The answer lies in the fear of a large number of English Canadians that giving the Quebec government more power would weaken the federal Government. Trying to satisfy the demands of Quebec and the concerns of English Canada, the accord's framers came up with a meaningless text that angered all.</p>
        <p>The accord also created an equal and elected Senate on the American model. The demand for an equal Senate came largely from Western Canada. Many there felt that the demographical weight of the central Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec) in the House of Commons didn't allow their voice to be heard.</p>
        <p>The equal Senate was unpopular in Quebec. Many Quebecers feared losing their influence in the House of Commons. The framers tried to get around this by cutting the powers of the Senate and permanently guaranteeing Quebec 25 percent of House of Commons seats. This enraged voters in British Columbia, whose increasing population would never be fully represented in the House.</p>
        <p>These are but two examples of how Canada's new fathers of confederation tried to satisfy the demands of various groups without stepping on the toes of others. It is hardly surprising that this exercise failed.</p>
        <p>You state that "America can take no comfort from the prospect of continued divisive wrangling in the house of its closest ally." Your desire to have a peaceful and contented neighbor is indeed touching. The forces that are tearing the Canadian federation apart are, however, too powerful to be papered over, even in the interest of providing the United States a stable ally. STEPHEN ALBERT Montreal, Nov. 4, 1992</p>
