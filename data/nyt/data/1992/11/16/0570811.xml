        <p>"I tried very, very hard to develop a convincing rationale for the 'Emperor' Concerto," Glenn Gould wrote in one of many thought-provoking diatribes against Beethoven. Emanuel Ax's inspired performance of the "Emperor" on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall might have won Gould over, at least for a moment.  Mr. Ax, celebrating the 15th anniversary of his debut with the New York Philharmonic, did not merely circumvent the structural oddities that sometimes make this work sound clunky in performance; he confronted those pitfalls, emerging with a fresh and powerful vision of the whole.</p>
        <p>The principal challenge of the "Emperor" comes in the first movement, where a heroic tone is rent by abrupt contrasts. Few pianists can avoid seeming to run aground in the sullen development section. Mr. Ax judged those contrasts superbly; the clipped anger of the scales melted dreamily away in the upper registers.  Throughout the Concerto, he effortlessly segued from proclamation to meditation, allowing the widest possible space for the drama to thrash about. His phrasing of the finale's opening measures was improvisatory, yet decisive -- more Beethovenian paradoxes resolved. In the past several years, this pianist has come into his own as a passionate exponent of 19th-century classics; his ovation was well deserved.</p>

        <p>The orchestral contribution Thursday night held considerably less interest. Andre Previn supplied serviceable accompaniments in the "Emperor," although he seemingly enjoys Beethoven's idiom more than he understands it. Haydn's Symphony No. 92 was rather dull and flat-footed, lacking crisp articulation. And Ravel's "Mother Goose" ballet, usually foolproof, also had lethargic stretches. The Philharmonic played well, but Mr. Previn's schematic motions provided no interpretive spark.</p>
