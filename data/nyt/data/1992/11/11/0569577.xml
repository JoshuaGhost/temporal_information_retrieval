        <p>HOSPITAL stocks have skidded in recent months as investors worried that Gov. Bill Clinton's plans for health care might hurt earnings. Some institutional fund managers unloaded hospital shares; some stood firm, hoping for better days.</p>
        <p>"Investors were spooked by the campaign rhetoric," said John F. Hindelong, a health-care securities analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Both major political parties endorsed managed competition, under which groups of buyers would combine to try to force down prices. And Governor Clinton also came out for health-care spending targets, which were perceived as a further threat to hospital revenues.</p>
        <p>But some hospital analysts say revenues will continue to grow robustly in the Clinton Administration. They say that Congress will balk at the idea of a spending target. They think Mr. Clinton will have more success in finding ways to pay for the 35 million currently uninsured Americans. Hospitals typically swallow the costs for nonpaying patients. "If these people get coverage, the hospitals will get paid for something they now do free," said Carl Sherman, an analyst at Dillon, Read.</p>
        <p>Zachary Shafran, a health care analyst with Waddell &amp; Reed, an investment management firm based in Shawnee Mission, Kan., said, "High-quality hospitals with the latest technology will continue to play a central role in health care." The hospital companies are well positioned to handle any changes ordered by Washington, he said, adding, "Hospitals have learned to operate well within the system." Most adjusted well to the change to pre-set payments for each illness, which led to shorter stays and empty beds in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Hospital stocks have also been crimped by developments at Humana Inc., a 78-hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky., and National Medical Enterprises, with 125 hospitals, based in Santa Monica., Calif. Humana reported quarterly losses last month, which included restructuring expenses after the failure of its strategy to fill hospital beds with patients from Humana's own H.M.O.'s. It traded yesterday at $23.625, up 37.5 cents.</p>
        <p>National Medical Enterprises' profits shrank after Texas investigators charged last year that the chain's psychiatric hospitals had used improper patient recruiting and billing practices. In the wake of the Texas investigation, National Medical Enterprises watched operating earnings from psychiatric hospitals plummet by 77 percent in the fiscal year that ended last May. The chain, whose stock was unchanged yesterday at $12.375, is eliminating 25 psychiatric units.</p>
        <p>"Except for Humana and National Medical Enterprises, virtually every acute-care hospital company is having a terrific year," Mr. Hindelong said. Both Mr. Hindelong and Mr. Sherman recommend the Columbia Hospital Corporation, based in Fort Worth, which operates clusters of profitable hospitals in South Florida and Texas. Columbia Hospital stock gained $1.25 yesterday, closing at $17.50.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman also likes the HCA Hospital Corporation, based in Nashville. Its closed yesterday at $18.125, up 37.5 cents. The company went public in February, emerging from private ownership through a leveraged buyout. The chain is retiring debt ahead of schedule. Mr. Sherman projects 21 percent earnings growth for 1992, two-thirds from reducing debt expense.</p>
        <p>On the negative side, HCA's price has been dampened by the prospect of sales of millions of shares by original investors, who stand to collect handsome profits in light of their low cost basis of $2.50 a share. Mr. Sherman said that similar prospects for profit taking by original investors were weighing on Health Trust Inc., an 82-hospital Nashville-based group, which HCA spun off to the group's executives in a 1987 leveraged buyout. Health Trust stock closed yesterday at $15.625, unchanged.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Alexander, manager of the Putnam Health Sciences Trust, a Boston-based mutual fund, sold her last hospital stock, HCA, several months ago. "I felt most of the earnings growth is coming from debt reduction, and operating income growth is very small," she said. "I'm more interested in operating earnings."</p>
        <p>Lois Friedman, a health care analyst who is also with the Putnam Companies, said managed care pressure on costs by insurers and other big customers had depressed hospital profit margins. Some Putnam funds are holding hospital stocks while the fund managers are "waiting out" the debt-reduction period and other post-buyout developments at HCA and Health Trust, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherman at Dillon, Read said HCA would bring its debt down sharply in the next two years. Then, he thinks, it will start paying dividends and may begin to grow by expanding into new markets.</p>
        <p>HCA reported a $268 million loss last month for the third quarter. It attributed the loss to problems in the company's psychiatric division. HCA set aside $333 million after taxes to cover the costs of selling 22 of its 48 psychiatric units and a related restructuring. It will then be able to concentrate on its 73 general hospitals.</p>
