        <p>A Justice Department memorandum outlining the Government's strategy for prosecuting the police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King has fallen into the hands of defense lawyers, Justice Department officials said tonight.</p>

        <p>A Justice Department memorandum outlining the Government's strategy for prosecuting the police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King has fallen into the hands of defense lawyers, Justice Department officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>The leak was first described in a transcript released tonight of a report scheduled for broadcast on Friday on the National Public Radio program "Morning Edition." The transcript quoted a former Justice Department official, Abbey Lowell, as saying whoever provided the memorandum wanted "to make sure the defense has every opportunity to take advantage of the weaknesses of the Government's case."</p>
        <p>The disclosure is under investigation by the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, which is responsible for prosecuting criminal wrongdoing by public officials. Betrayal Is Feared</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials, who spoke on condition that they would not be identified, said there was little concern that the aquisition of the memo by defense lawyers would divulge secrets that would give the defense a tactical advantage. That is because there are thought to be few secrets to divulge: the witnesses and evidence at the officers' upcoming Federal civil rights trial in California are likely to mirror the officers' state trial, which ended in acquittal on most assault charges last April.</p>
        <p>More worrisome to the Justice Department is the prospect that law-enforcement officials or agents might have betrayed the Government out of allegiance to fellow officers.</p>
        <p>"If there was such a case it would cast doubt on the prosecutorial process," said John Dunne, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, whose division is supervising the prosecution. String of Embarrassments</p>
        <p>The disclosure also comes at a time when the Justice Department is smarting from a series of embarrassments, including charges that it tried to scuttle an investigation of improper loans to Iraq. It has also endured investigations of the travel and management practices of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the F.B.I.'s participation in an undercover operation directed against President Bush's Texas campaign manager at the height of the campaign.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department official said tonight that the prosecution memo fell into the hands of defense lawyers about two months ago. Lawyers following the case said there was no sign that the leak had had any impact on the case so far.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 12, prosecutors lost an important pretrial test when a Federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that he would not admit evidence showing that the officers had been guilty of prior misconduct or that one of them had apparently made racial comments before the beating. It was not clear whether the Justice Department trial document affected the outcome. Racial Unrest Feared</p>
        <p>The police officers, whose acquittal set off three days of rioting that left more than 50 people dead and caused $1 billion in damages, are accused of beating Mr. King, a black motorist, in March, 1991, in an incident that was videotaped by a bystander.</p>
        <p>Officials in Washington and Los Angeles are acutely concerned about the racial animosity that has lingered and even deepened since the riots, and are said to be worried that the disclosure of the memorandum could inflame a still-shaken city.</p>
        <p>One of the defense lawyers, Harland W. Braun, said the whole matter had been cloaked by a judicial order. "The problem I have is that I cannot even tell you if there is a gag order," he said.</p>
        <p>However he did point to local news articles about secret hearings in the case, before Federal District Judge John G. Davies, and reports that certain documents had been sealed by the judge. The whole matter has been "percolating for a while," he said. He provided no further elaboration except to say, "Secrecy is very hard to maintain in big cases." Mr. Braun represents Officer Theodore J. Briseno.</p>
        <p>An assistant to Paul de Pasquale, the lawyer for Officer Timothy Wind, said the lawyer had not heard the N.P.R. report and could not comment. Ira Saltzman, who represents another defendent, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, also declined to comment.</p>
