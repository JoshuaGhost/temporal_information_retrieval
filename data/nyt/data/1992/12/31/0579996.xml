        <p>Early returns in Kenya's first multi-party elections in 26 years gave President Daniel arap Moi a narrow lead today in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>With tabulations in from 41 of Kenya's 188 voting precincts, Mr. Moi had 372,138 votes. Among his main challengers in the elections on Tuesday, Kenneth Matiba had 336,881 votes, Oginga Odinga had 115,873 votes and Mwai Kibaki had 114,243 votes.</p>
        <p>Apart from the presidential contest, some 700 candidates from eight parties are competing for 188 seats in the single-chamber National Assembly.</p>
        <p>An unexpectedly large turnout in the balloting, which almost swamped the country's electoral machinery, led to long delays in counting and in some remote areas voting continued throughout today.</p>
        <p>There were complaints from two of the main opposition parties who accused the Government of grossly manipulating vote figures. The Government has made no comment on the allegations, and international observers said it was too early to say if they were true.</p>
        <p>There were also reports of scattered violence. Extra police officers have been deployed in several of Kenya's main towns.</p>
        <p>In midtown Nairobi, an angry crowd caught and beat an electoral official carrying blank ballot papers into a counting center. With the polls closed here, nothing the mob's victim said could convince them that he was not trying to rig the election. Only swift action by the police, who fired guns into the air to disperse the crowd, prevented a lynching.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, one man was reported killed during balloting on Tuesday in the port city of Mombasa.</p>
        <p>Perceptions of the election's integrity are expected to determine whether widespread disorders erupt and possibly sweep up the general public.</p>
        <p>"If, as I suspect, that ballot papers and ballot boxes have been doctored, and Moi rigs himself into the presidency, then this country could go up in flames," said Makau Matua, a Kenyan who is the head of the Harvard Law School Human Rights Program.</p>
        <p>Even before the elections, the International Republican Institute, a team of American observers affiliated with the Republican Party, issued a report critical of the Government's handling of the campaign.</p>
        <p>The group said it had heard reports about people offering large sums of cash to buy electoral cards. It also heard charges that famine relief food was being used to bribe voters, although it said the reports had not been independently confirmed.</p>
