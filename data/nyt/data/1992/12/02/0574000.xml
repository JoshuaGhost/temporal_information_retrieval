        <p>NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, may be able to assemble an infusion of $250 million to shore up its cash position by the end of this week, provided its banks agree to permit new lenders a share of the carrier's assets, an industry executive familiar with the discussions said yesterday.</p>

        <p>NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, may be able to assemble an infusion of $250 million to shore up its cash position by the end of this week, provided its banks agree to permit new lenders a share of the carrier's assets, an industry executive familiar with the discussions said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The executive also said that Northwest had asked its banks to defer $270 million in loan payments and to grant other relief steps that would help ease the pressure on the company in meeting payments on its $4 billion in debt amid an industrywide slump.</p>
        <p>The executive, who insisted on not being identified, confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that three of Northwest's major suppliers would lend the airline about $50 million each if its bank lenders allowed them to share in the fleet of aircraft that secure about $1.25 billion in bank loans.</p>
        <p>The three suppliers are the General Electric Company, Airbus Industrie and the United Technologies Corporation.</p>
        <p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which holds more than 50 percent of the equity in Northwest, has already pledged to lend the company $50 million and its lead bank, the Bankers Trust Company, has agreed to put up $50 million.</p>
        <p>As previously reported, most of the other banks are willing to go along with the new loan even though it will not be secured by any new collateral but by assets already backing other loans.</p>
        <p>Some of the banks have been waiting for parties like the suppliers and the executives who led the buyout of the carrier in 1989, Alfred Checchi and Gary Wilson, to put up some money as well. First Request for Relief</p>
        <p>Northwest has so far been able to meet its huge interest payments and loan repayments on the debt accumulated since the buyout and this would be the first time that Mr. Checchi has asked lenders for relief.</p>
        <p>The airline has drawn down the last of its credit lines and is in the midst of the slowest travel period, so it has had to dip into cash reserves for operating capital.</p>
        <p>NWA, which is based in Minneapolis, has a major hub in Detroit and an extensive route network to the Pacific. Its problems have been compounded since a slowdown in the economies of Japan and other Far Eastern countries has cut travel and revenue on its normally profitable Pacific routes.</p>
