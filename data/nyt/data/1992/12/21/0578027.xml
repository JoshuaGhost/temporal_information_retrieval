        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Blood and Ink in Mexico" (Op-Ed, Nov. 28) by Zachary Margulis, about the murder of a publisher from southeastern Mexico and of his own experience in a conflict with his editors at the The Mexico City News, are important to the perception readers may form about civil liberties, and freedom of expression, in Mexico.</p>
        <p>The murder of Ignacio Mendoza Castillo was subsequently investigated by Mexican authorities and by the InterAmerican Press Association, which represents more than 1,200 publications in this hemisphere. Both investigations found Mr. Mendoza was killed for reasons unrelated to his activities as a journalist.</p>
        <p>Mexican authorities found Mr. Mendoza's alleged murderer at the end of November; he was positively identified by the victim's children, charged and indicted. His case is under way in Mexico's criminal courts. The murder was related to a financial dispute between the victim and the alleged perpetrator.</p>
        <p>According to the press association's president, Alejandro Junco de la Vega, who headed his organization's investigation of the case, "it appears the murder had nothing to do with journalism."</p>
        <p>According to The Wall Street Journal of Dec. 4: "Mr. Mendoza lent money at 7 percent per week and collected loan payments by means of armed guards who increased the interest rate as they saw fit. Mr. Mendoza's apparent assassin recently had sold him property on credit, which Mr. Mendoza then resold without paying back the man who allegedly killed him."</p>
        <p>Mr. Margulis mixed his account of the murder with a conflict he had with his editors. The circumstances are a private matter that concerns The News and Mr. Margulis. The Presidency of Mexico has exercised no pressure on The News or on Mr. Margulis to prevent publication of any article or to modify its content.</p>
        <p>The Mexican Government has taken a series of important steps to provide guarantees for freedom of expression and the exercise of journalism. The Government's monopoly control of the sale and distribution of newsprint was ended during this administration. El Nacional, the state-owned daily, and two television channels are being privatized.</p>
        <p>To put allegations of Government payoffs to journalists to rest, a new mechanism will be instituted shortly by Mexico's Comptroller General to review the press and public relations budgets of Government agencies. In addition, the Presidency has ceased to cover journalists' expenses on the President's tours abroad.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Mexican Government has established rapid-response mechanisms in civil liberties cases, including the establishment of a national ombudsman, the National Commission for Human Rights. The commission released a report last June in which it reported it had reviewed 55 cases of alleged offenses against journalists. The commission had completed its review of 39 of these cases and issued specific recommendations to governmental authorities in 16 of them.</p>
        <p>Our Government's policy is to protect freedom of expression and to improve the practice of independent journalism. MANUEL ALONSO  Consul General of Mexico New York, Dec. 7, 1992</p>
