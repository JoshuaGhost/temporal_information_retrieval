        <p>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company is planning to announce in January that it will close about 100 unprofitable and underperforming stores and significantly scale back its hefty "big book" catalogue operation, according to a published report yesterday.</p>
        <p>A company spokesman would not comment on the report in The Chicago Tribune, and telephone calls to executives' offices were not returned yesterday.</p>
        <p>But in one-on-one meetings with securities analysts this week, Arthur C. Martinez, the new chief executive of Sears's merchandising group, said he intended to cut $600 million from the unit's cost structure next year through store closings, reductions in the catalogue and layoffs. Stock Up on Report</p>
        <p>Yesterday's report apparently pleased the stock market, which sent Sears's stock up $1.50, to $44.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>For almost a decade, analysts and consultants have implored Sears to close its unprofitable smaller stores and focus on bigger stores with better efficiencies of scale.</p>
        <p>"It's not a question of this being a surprise," said Peter Siris, an analyst at UBS Securities. "Everybody and his brother knows they're going to close stores. They have to to get costs down."</p>
        <p>Mr. Siris said Sears might convert some of its smaller, unproductive Sears stores into specialty stores like Brand Central and Sears Paint and Hardware.</p>
        <p>The store closings and reduction in the catalogue would be yet another sign that Sears, after years of dithering while leaner, more aggressive retailers picked away its business, is getting serious about turning its vast corporate flab into muscle.</p>
        <p>The move would also be further evidence that Mr. Martinez is making good on his promises to re-engineer the ailing retailer. Last month, Sears announced it would accept Visa and Mastercard in 140 of its stores on a test basis, breaking a tradition of accepting only the Sears card.</p>
        <p>Gerald Buldak, a spokesman for Sears, said the company did not comment on rumor and speculation. He added that the retail group was continuing to study ways to reduce its costs, which are considered excessive in comparison with most of its competitors. 48,000 Jobs Lost</p>
        <p>About 48,000 jobs have been eliminated since the middle of 1990, and an entire layer of regional management has vanished, streamlining the chain of command.</p>
        <p>And on Sept. 29, the corporation announced that it would uncobble its collection of businesses, spinning off its financial-services unit, Dean Witter Reynolds, and its real estate division, Coldwell Banker, and offering the public a 20 percent stake in its Allstate insurance subsidiary.</p>
        <p>In an interview in October, Mr. Martinez said he planned to close some stores. "We've got 860, and we'll probably get rid of some of those," he said. "Our job is to get the earnings base turned around, getting reasonable growth out of the base business, and then determine what the layer is that goes on top of that."  COMPANY NEWS</p>
