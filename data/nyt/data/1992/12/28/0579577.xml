        <p>While the television industry watches to see whether Jay Leno or David Letterman is left standing after their shootout at the late-night corral, the real winner may be the innocent bystander.</p>
        <p>That's the theory at ABC, which owns the bystanding program, "Nightline." ABC News executives are especially relishing the prospect that no matter what the ultimate configuration -- Mr. Letterman at CBS and Mr. Leno at NBC, or vice versa -- the entertainment audience at 11:30 P.M. Eastern time will be split, leaving "Nightline" to dominate the period with its news audience.</p>

        <p>While the television industry watches to see whether Jay Leno or David Letterman is left standing after their shootout at the late-night corral, the real winner may be the innocent bystander.</p>
        <p>That's the theory at ABC, which owns the bystanding program, "Nightline." ABC News executives are especially relishing the prospect that no matter what the ultimate configuration -- Mr. Letterman at CBS and Mr. Leno at NBC, or vice versa -- the entertainment audience at 11:30 P.M. Eastern time will be split, leaving "Nightline" to dominate the period with its news audience.</p>
        <p>"If Letterman and Leno divide up the audience now watching the 'Tonight' show," Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said in an interview last week, "the one program that's different stands to benefit. We have the program that's different."</p>
        <p>"Nightline" is already different enough to stand out from the rest of the late-night lineup, which includes Mr. Leno's "Tonight" show on NBC, "Studs" on Fox stations, and syndicated shows including "Arsenio Hall" and "Rush Limbaugh."</p>
        <p>The late-night news program with Ted Koppel is finishing one of its most successful years, with its overall ratings up significantly from the previous year. For the first 12 weeks of the fourth quarter, "Nightline" has been averaging a 5.2 rating. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) That's up 13 percent from the 4.6 rating the program averaged in the fourth quarter of 1991.</p>
        <p>"Nightline" is also much closer to Mr. Leno's "Tonight" show than it was in its last year under Johnny Carson. This year, Mr. Leno has averaged a 5.3 rating in the half hour that opposes "Nightline." Last year, "Tonight" had a 5.7 rating for that period.</p>
        <p>"Nightline" was helped by the attention that surrounded the Presidential election. "Nightline" owns the franchise in late-night news coverage and always dominates during major news events. It also had high ratings for the week American troops landed in Somalia.</p>
        <p>But "Nightline" has also won in the ratings when the news was not especially compelling. It won one week in November covering such topics as the movie "Malcolm X" and Lee A. Iacocca.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arledge credited a new format for the show, under a new executive producer, Tom Bettag, which includes more investigative reports and features and fewer interviews.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Letterman and Mr. Leno go head to head with entertainment, "Nightline" also stands to pick up more profits. "It's a very profitable program the way it is," Mr. Arledge said, declining to be specific.</p>
        <p>NBC takes in $75 million to $100 million in profit for its late-night lineup, but that's almost certain to decline. NBC could be hit with the cost of matching Mr. Letterman's $16 million-a-year offer from CBS, which would also mean a $10 million buyout of Mr. Leno, or else it could see its profits on both its 11:30 and 12:30 programs diminish if they have to face serious competition from CBS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arledge said profits at "Nightline" should increase if it becomes the clear-cut late-night leader.</p>
        <p>Still, one senior advertising agency executive said: "News can't charge as high a price as entertainment. Some advertisers worry about news content; others simply prefer to place their commercials inside an entertainment framework."</p>
        <p>What makes the success of "Nightline" this year a more significant achievement, Mr. Arledge said, is the disadvantage the program works under every week. "Here we are almost tied for No. 1, and we only have 62 percent live clearances."</p>
        <p>Indeed, about 40 percent of viewers do not see "Nightline" immediately after their late local news. Instead they see syndicated shows like "Cheers" and "Entertainment Tonight" and must wait at least a half hour -- until midnight in the East -- to see the show.</p>
        <p>For years, ABC has urged its stations to help "Nightline" by moving it to the spot immediately after the late local news. But many stations make too much revenue from the syndicated programs to consider the move.</p>
        <p>ABC had hoped to increase the incentive for the stations still delaying "Nightline" by grabbing Mr. Letterman for itself, and placing his show at midnight, directly after "Nightline." Mr. Koppel even appeared as a guest on Mr. Letterman's NBC show and urged him to take that deal from ABC. A Koppel/Letterman lineup would have compelled many of the stations now delaying "Nightline" to abandon the syndicated shows.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Letterman's agents at the Creative Artists Agency mandated that Mr. Letterman get a show in the 11:30 time period. That ended negotiations because the network refused to consider moving "Nightline" back an hour.</p>
        <p>"It's true that the network had hoped to get Letterman for midnight," Mr. Arledge said. "But our second-biggest wish was for him to go to CBS. Our biggest nightmare was for him to go into syndication."</p>
        <p>If Mr. Letterman had chosen to start up a late-night show in syndication, "Nightline" might have been seriously threatened, Mr. Arledge said, because a number of ABC stations surely would have signed on to take Mr. Letterman's show, forcing "Nightline" to be delayed a full hour instead of a half hour.</p>
        <p>"But this is working out very well for us," Mr. Arledge said. "If Leno and Letterman each end up with about a 4 rating, and we're still getting a 5.2, then Ted Koppel will be the biggest star in late night."</p>
