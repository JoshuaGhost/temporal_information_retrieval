      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It has been nearly four years since the afternoon in 1989 when she took off her clothes for the teen-age boys and did everything they asked, but the young retarded woman at the center of the Glen Ridge sex assault case still cannot face her mother.</p>
        <p>When the young woman took the witness stand today to give her account of that afternoon, she did so only with the promise that her mother would stay away from the courtroom, a prosecutor said. Although the woman, now 21 years old, still lives with her parents, she has never told them what happened.</p>
        <p>It was not possible to know whether she believed that she had succeeded in keeping the details of her behavior from her parents, but in her testimony there was much to suggest that she has difficulty understanding the world and the people around her. Her answers to questions from the lawyers and the judge rarely ran to more than a word or two. She seemed incapable of offering any narrative or explanation. But as she spoke about her life and about the boys she had thought were her friends, the boundaries of her world emerged.  First Confrontation</p>
        <p>Plain and plump, she described how she had gone to a park on March 1, 1989, to play basketball alone. There she met some boys she knew and followed them to one of their homes, where she took off her clothes and performed and submitted to a range of sexual acts that the boys suggested. She had been told, she said, that one of the boys would take her out on a date that night if she cooperated. The boy never did.</p>
        <p>Her appearance in court today was the first time the jurors in the nine-week-old trial had seen the woman, whom defense lawyers have suggested is an aggressive temptress who engaged in sex because she enjoyed it. It was also the first time since the incident that she has faced the four young men accused of sexually assaulting her. A fifth defendant is to be tried separately.</p>
        <p>The contrast between the woman and the four defendants was stark as they sat about 30 feet apart in the courtroom. The young men, once popular high school athletes, sat stiffly in gray suits, staring at her impassively as she spoke.</p>
        <p>Fidgeting and squirming on the witness stand, the young woman rarely glanced in their direction. Exasperation at some questions that seemed to baffle her gave way to an occasional pout.</p>
        <p>Indeed, whether the young woman could be considered intelligent enough to testify at all was not resolved until Judge R. Benjamin Cohen ruled this morning that she understood the difference between the truth and a lie. Fantasy and Reality</p>
        <p>"If I say my robe is black, is that the truth?" the judge asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," the woman replied.</p>
        <p>"If I say I'm standing up, is that the truth?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"No," she said. "You're sitting down."</p>
        <p>Such interviews are normally reserved for very young children whose grasp of reality is in doubt.</p>
        <p>Testimony at the trial has indicated that the woman has an I.Q. of only 64 and sometimes has difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality. In her testimony, she seemed to bolster that assessment. When a prosecutor showed her a baseball bat that she had recently helped to purchase for use at the trial, she said that it was the one the boys had inserted in her vagina nearly four years ago. She seemed to find no contradiction in her statements about the bat, which she also acknowledged helping to buy.</p>
        <p>Her answers to questions about the incident and its aftermath were straight-forward, but she acknowledged toward the end of the day that she "might have messed up a little" when she described performing oral sex on some of the boys. Instead, she said, she thought she had used her hands to sexually arouse them.</p>
        <p>Only once did she become squeamish. When asked by Robert D. Laurino, one of the prosecutors, to describe how she felt physically after the incident, she hid her face in her hands and refused to answer. "It's embarrassing," she moaned.</p>
        <p>Speaking slowly and gently, as if to a young child, Mr. Laurino said: "I know it's embarrassing, but we're all adults here. You can tell us."</p>
        <p>After a time she looked up and responded: "It hurt. It hurt when I went to the bathroom."</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have attempted to cast the young woman as a lonely teen-ager who would do nearly anything to win the friendship and affection of others.</p>
        <p>Today she said that if her friends asked her to do something she would do it. But she no longer considers the boys her friends, she added.</p>
        <p>But her reassessment of the relationship was slow in coming. After the boys had finished with her, she said, and she had put on her clothes she remained at the house in the hope of winning a date with one of them. "I thought he might still want to go out with me," she said.</p>
        <p>"Had he ever gone out with you before?" Mr. Laurino asked.</p>
        <p>"No," she whispered.</p>
        <p>"Did he go out with you that night?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>She was placed on birth control pills after the incident, according to earlier testimony. Now, the young woman said, she sometimes baby-sits for relatives and plays the piano, which she learned by ear. And she has a job in a Head Start preschool program.</p>
        <p>"I work with little children," she said. "I play with them."</p>
