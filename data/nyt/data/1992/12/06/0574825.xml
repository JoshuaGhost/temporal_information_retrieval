        <p>As he sought the Democratic Presidential nomination, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas made an issue of his nine-year battle against cancer, saying he had been disease-free since a bone marrow transplant in 1986. His doctors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston concurred, minimizing the chances for a recurrence of his lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. In fact, the lymphoma had recurred in 1987, making it unlikely that he had been cured.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Tsongas confirmed that he was facing a new fight. A growth in his abdomen turned out to be lymphoma; the cell type had changed from small cell to large cell, a not-unusual turn of events in the disease. The news was good and bad, he said at a press conference. Bad because the cancer had returned, apparently in a more aggressive cell type. Good because the lymphoma seemed confined to his abdomen and seemed likely to respond to chemotherapy and radiation.</p>

        <p>Mr. Tsongas acknowledged having made mistakes in discussing his health, and said he realized that full disclosure was the only approach for a Presidential candidate. To avoid similar problems in the future, he urged Bill Clinton to set up a national commission to determine what a candidate must disclose.</p>
