        <p>The President of Serbia has passed out stacks of newly printed bills and successfully evaded United Nations economic sanctions, taking advantage of the reeling economy to insure he renews his five-year hold on power in elections on Dec. 20.</p>
        <p>"The Government is doing all it can to keep things together until election day," said Dejan Popovic, an economist at Belgrade University's law school. "The balloon will burst afterward. It has to."</p>
        <p>President Slobodan Milosevic has bought short-term popular support as the elections near by simply printing money to pay wages in large industrial enterprises that have produced little or nothing for months.</p>
        <p>Crisp new bills have also gone to pay pensions as well as price subsidies for farmers, and the Government has kept a lid on the prices of utilities.</p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, few people here understand anything about economics," Mr. Popovic said. Dinar's Value Down Sharply</p>
        <p>Inflation has gobbled up 85 percent of the dinar's value in the last six months. Economists project that real unemployment could top 60 percent by year's end and that production in December could drop 65 percent below that of the same month last year.</p>
        <p>Serbia's economy entered its free fall long before May 30, when the Security Council imposed economic sanctions on this country for arming the Serbs who have dismembered Bosnia and Herzegovina and expelled thousands of Muslims from their homes.</p>
        <p>Stiffer sanctions took effect last month when the Serbs' success in evading the original restrictions became an embarrassment. The new measures give Serbia's neighbors the authority to interdict shipping on the Danube River and Adriatic Sea. Cargo vehicles are also banned from crossing the country with oil, machinery, steel, tires and other critical goods without United Nations approval.</p>
        <p>The new sanctions have yet to produce an appreciable reduction in consumer goods here, and when Romania halted its first Serbian tanker on the Danube last week the Serbs retaliated by seizing six Romanian barges on their stretch of the river.</p>
        <p>"The people here were known for centuries as tobacco smugglers," said the head of a major Western airline's Belgrade office. "Now they've just turned to something else." Shelves Are Overflowing</p>
        <p>Belgrade store shelves are overflowing with high-priced imported Greek diapers, German coffee, French shampoo and American detergent skimmed from aid packages and hoards of Turkish wares, many substituting for domestic goods no longer produced because the sanctions have succeeded in cutting imports of spare parts and bulk ingredients.</p>
        <p>This summer's seven-day-long gas lines all but evaporated after the Government and a new class of racketeers began importing petroleum with the help of sanctions-busting companies in nearby countries.</p>
        <p>So lucrative has the importing of gasoline and consumer goods become that private pumps have mushroomed all over Serbia, and local banks are paying hard-currency depositors 12 to 14 percent in monthly interest to raise money to underwrite imports.</p>
        <p>"We put our 5,000 German marks into Dafiment Banka a year ago," said Nenad, a 56-year-old electrician, referring to one "private" bank that clearly has close links with the Milosevic Government. "Now we have 23,000."</p>
        <p>A Western diplomat, comparing Yugoslav bankers to a cross between the writers of chain letters and loan sharks, said, "The bankers are using the money to make monthly profits of 50 percent or more.</p>
        <p>He added, "It will all collapse like a house of cards when the turnover is no longer enough to pay the interest." How Gasoline Gets In</p>
        <p>To evade sanctions, Serbia has been importing petroleum in barges and tankers up the Danube River through Romania and Bulgaria or in tanker trucks registered in Macedonia or Serbian-controlled areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.</p>
        <p>The southwestern Bulgarian town of Petric has become known throughout the Balkans as "Little Kuwait" because Greek companies have loaded so much gasoline there into Serbian tanker trucks.</p>
        <p>"In recent weeks they weren't even hiding the license plates," the Western diplomat said. "It's been a free-for-all."</p>
        <p>The money to pay for the imports appears to be coming from the Serbs' personal hard-currency savings or from an officially estimated $1.12 billion in hard currency remittances sent in so far by relatives working abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Popovic said, "The money is coming out from the mattresses because people are forced to spend it or because they are lured by the astronomical interest rates."  Like the U.S. Bootleggers</p>
        <p>"The underworld economy is spreading," Mr. Popovic said, comparing Yugoslavia's black marketeers with American bootleggers of the 1920's. "Many of the people who are leaders of the Mafia have connections with the Government, and these people are running for office in the elections."</p>
        <p>For those with no savings or access to hard currency, however, survival has become a struggle as the average salary for people with jobs has slipped to just $60 a month, far below the cost of living for a family with two children.</p>
        <p>"I can't even afford a piece of pork to go with the beans," said Olga, a 65-year-old woman whose $12 a month pension barely covers her utilities bills.</p>
        <p>An angry Mirosav Tomic, who drives a cab, said: "They doubled the price of gasoline again this morning. But this Milosevic will still win here. He is defending Serbia and won't give up an inch of it."</p>
