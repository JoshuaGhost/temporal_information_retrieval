        <p>Victoria and Alan H. go to sleep many nights ashamed of how they are raising their three young daughters. They wish they could nurture the girls by helping them with homework, taking them to museums or pushing them on the swings at the playground. Instead, the girls are often forgotten.</p>
        <p>That is because the girls' parents spend nearly all their time caring for their eldest child, a 10-year-old son who is emotionally disturbed. The boy often wanders through their apartment in Brooklyn disconnected from reality and unresponsive to other family members. He smears food on his clothes, is agitated easily and sometimes runs away. Numerous doctors have been unable to treat him.</p>

        <p>Victoria and Alan H. go to sleep many nights ashamed of how they are raising their three young daughters. They wish they could nurture the girls by helping them with homework, taking them to museums or pushing them on the swings at the playground. Instead, the girls are often forgotten.</p>
        <p>That is because the girls' parents spend nearly all their time caring for their eldest child, a 10-year-old son who is emotionally disturbed. The boy often wanders through their apartment in Brooklyn disconnected from reality and unresponsive to other family members. He smears food on his clothes, is agitated easily and sometimes runs away. Numerous doctors have been unable to treat him.</p>
        <p>"Every little thing bothers him," Victoria said. "Two nights ago, the neighbors were walking upstairs and he heard footsteps. He was so frightened that he couldn't go to sleep and he kept me up until 2 A.M." Time for Herself</p>
        <p>She became so tired and overwhelmed that she cried nearly every day until she began seeing a social worker from the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. The board is financed by United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.</p>
        <p>At their first session, the social worker asked Victoria a simple question: "Do you have any time for yourself?" When she said no, the social worker arranged for an attendant to visit her home every few weeks to take care of the children so she could relax for a few hours.</p>
        <p>The assistance provided by Mishkon, an agency of the Jewish Board, also helped Victoria cope with worries about the family's finances. Victoria does not work. Because of cutbacks, Alan may lose his job as a teacher next week, further straining a budget that was already drained by doctor bills. 'We Are Praying'</p>
        <p>The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has come to the aid of families in crisis since the early years of this century. The fund is now conducting its 81st appeal at a time when charities across New York City must meet growing responsibilities. The Neediest charities help New Yorkers like Alan and Victoria as well as people who are for the first time in their lives facing unemployment, homelessness or illnesses.</p>
        <p>The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.</p>
        <p>Because of Mishkon, Victoria and Alan now have the energy to spend more time with their daughters. They can sit down at night and read stories to the girls or quiz them on their math tables. And Victoria is more hopeful about finding treatment that will ease her son's isolation.</p>
        <p>"We are praying," she said. "We have to give him a chance. Many people say we should put him in an institution. But he is a child with a soul and the intelligence is there. He has sisters who love him and he brings joy into the house." Previously recorded . . .  $2,304,978.85 Recorded yesterday . . .  $31,000.20 Total . . .  $2,335,979.05</p>
