        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Fervid Debate on Gambling: Disease or Moral Weakness?" (front page, Nov. 21) loses sight of a third possibility that could obviate the need for a debate in the first place.</p>
        <p>A psychoanalytic approach to problem gambling sees it as neither a moral weakness nor a disease, but rather as a symptom of a disease. This shift in prognosis avails the problem gambler of an altogether more favorable prognosis, even though the disease of which problem gambling is a symptom is difficult to treat in its own right.</p>
        <p>Calling a problem gambler morally weak is an attempt to cure through reprimand. Such a gambler already knows himself to be out of control and driving toward destruction. Ironically, the judgment will be unconsciously welcomed by the problem gambler's voracious and hyperactive conscience. It will be taken as a punishment, giving him license for further gambling excess. A bet on the efficacy of the moralizing cure is a bet any bookmaker would be happy to take.</p>
        <p>The odds of genuine progress increase only slightly if the gambler's problem is defined as an incurable disease that can at best be held in check and then only by total abstinence. That is the perception shared by all mainstream recovery programs. The reality is that the preponderance of problem gamblers will never venture into a forced abstinence. They will not because they cannot. The call for abstinence is like telling an insomniac to get plenty of sleep.</p>
        <p>Your news article notes that many professionals code problem gambling a depression so as to assure insurance coverage for treatment. Could it be that some practitioners -- certainly those who are psychoanalytically oriented -- code it as such because depression is the true diagnosis?</p>
        <p>From a psychoanalytic point of view, problem gambling is a valiant but doomed attempt to cope with the pain of a severe depression. The destructive passion of the behavior mirrors the brutality of the repressed pain and the desperate need to flee it. The bets of such gamblers buy them a ride on a rocket ship whose destination, they pray, is an orbit beyond the gravitational pull of their own despair.</p>
        <p>When the underlying depression is successfully treated, a problem gambler will be free either to gamble in a controlled pattern or to give up gambling on his own terms. When the gambler is able to perceive his depression and to deal with it, gambling excesses serve no further purpose, and they disappear.
