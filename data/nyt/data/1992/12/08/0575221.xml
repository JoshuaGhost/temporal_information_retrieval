        <p>The Cosmopolitan Symphony Orchestra, a freelance ensemble for young professional musicians, has spawned a scaled-down subsidiary, the Cosmopolitan Chamber Orchestra. On Saturday afternoon, Michael Morgan led this reduced band in a program that, in stylistic terms, hung together oddly: Milhaud's jazzy "Creation du Monde" was followed by the fluty Baroque ebullience of Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 4.

        <p>Cosmopolitan Chamber Orchestra  Ethical Culture Society</p>
        <p>The Cosmopolitan Symphony Orchestra, a freelance ensemble for young professional musicians, has spawned a scaled-down subsidiary, the Cosmopolitan Chamber Orchestra. On Saturday afternoon, Michael Morgan led this reduced band in a program that, in stylistic terms, hung together oddly: Milhaud's jazzy "Creation du Monde" was followed by the fluty Baroque ebullience of Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 4. The intermission smoothed over the leap from the Bach to Mahler's "Ruckert" Lieder and Wagner's "Siegfried Idyll."</p>
        <p>But for an ensemble of this kind, the ability to show the players' versatility inevitably outweighs programmatic considerations. And at its best, one forgot the band's freelance status. That was the case in the Wagner. Mr. Morgan shaped the piece lovingly, giving it a real sense of ebb and flow, and drawing a rich, fully homogenous sound from his strings and winds. The "Brandenburg," was enlivened by transparent textures and brisk tempos, and in the Milhaud, the relationship between introspection and swing was well judged.</p>
        <p>Michael Dash, the baritone soloist in the Mahler, sounded constricted in the cycle's first two songs, and he had trouble projecting over Philip West's chamber orchestration. But his voice began to open up in "Ich atmet' einen linden Dutt" and from there to the end, he and Mr. Morgan collaborated on a reading that grew increasingly closer to this music's emotional core.</p>
