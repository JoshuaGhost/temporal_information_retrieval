        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "The True Meaning of Being a Catholic" (letter, Dec. 5), Msgr. Daniel S. Hamilton recommends to Pamela J. Maraldo that she "needs a refresher course on being an authentic Catholic" because she dissents from some of the moral positions taken by the Pope.</p>
        <p>May I suggest Monsignor Hamilton review the time-honored Roman Catholic moral theology teaching known as Probabilism.</p>
        <p>Probabilism teaches that in disputed questions on the moral acceptability of a particular action a person may in good conscience follow a probable opinion. That was defined as a position supported by at least a few reputable moral theologians, even if a majority of moral theologians took an opposite position. Today a huge number of Catholic moral theologians -- probably even a great majority -- support the morality of the use of artificial birth control.</p>
        <p>Monsignor Hamilton will also recall that popes have been egregiously erroneous, as, for example, Pope Gregory XVI in 1832, when he solemnly condemned freedom of conscience, calling it "deliramentum." He was reversed by the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom (Dec. 7, 1965).</p>
        <p>If Monsignor Hamilton were to consult the summer 1992 Gallup poll co-sponsored by the Association for the Rights of Catholics in the Church, he would find that the great majority of American Catholics follow the prudent position of responsible dissent in church matters and consequently consider themselves not less but more authentically Catholic for having done so.
