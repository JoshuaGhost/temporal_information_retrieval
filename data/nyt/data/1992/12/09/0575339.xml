        <p>Rescue workers began drilling today through 900 feet of limestone in an effort to provide air for eight coal miners missing underground since an explosion Monday morning.</p>
        <p>After meeting with experts at the hillside mine and visiting the miners' relatives, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told reporters that the drilling could take 24 hours. He said the strategy was being tried because carbon monoxide and methane gas were preventing rescuers from venturing inside.</p>
        <p>"It's a very volatile situation," Mr. Wilder said as the miners' families huddled in a school bus. "I know words seem empty when people are waiting for tangible results, but we're doing everything we can."</p>
        <p>He said the mine, set at the base of a snowy hill about five miles outside this Appalachian mountain town of 5,000 people in southwestern Virginia, had been destroyed by the explosion and that fumes of some type were still spewing from its entrances.</p>
        <p>The missing workers are believed to be trapped in a work space about 6,000 feet into the mountain. Rescuers have had no communication with them.</p>
        <p>Bill Tattersal, the Assistant Secretary of Labor, said that rescuers using a diamond-head bit drilled about 50 feet in the first hour.</p>
        <p>"So if all goes well, you can do the math to see how long it will take," he told reporters. He said the rescuers were drilling a hole of about 7 feet and lining it with 6 1/2-foot steel casing, leaving an 8-inch hole. "We can pump things in through that hole, or pump things out, and get a sensor down there, or a line, or food or water," he said. Rescuers plan to test gas levels and may lower a camera into the chamber where the miners were working.</p>
        <p>State and Federal rescue workers spent most of the night reconstructing the entrances and shafts of the mine, and came within about 500 feet of where the miners are believed to be before high levels of toxic gas forced them to stop.</p>
        <p>Officials this afternoon said they were uncertain if a fire was still burning underground.</p>
        <p>Mine officials, state regulators and Federal investigators refused to speculate about what caused the blast. But Sam Stafford, a spokesman for the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said, "98 percent of these explosions are caused by methane gas."</p>
