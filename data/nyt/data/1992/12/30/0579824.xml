        <p>Shootings and car thefts in Mogadishu, often aimed at military and relief workers, have increased markedly in recent days, underscoring what American military officials say is a heightened tension in the capital.</p>
        <p>In the past week, the number of gunshot wounds treated in the main hospital in Mogadishu has jumped from three a day just after the troops' arrival three weeks ago to more than 15, the level recorded the week before the American-led international force arrived, and doctors say that many wounded never make it to the hospital.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, three Red Cross workers were killed and one was wounded. On Monday, gunmen killed one worker with CARE International and shot several others during a car theft. Also on Monday, in a separate incident, marines killed a Somali gunman who had shot at them. Rising Tension Against U.S.</p>
        <p>"The military told us there was a rising tension against U.S. forces," said Rhodri Wynne-Pope, the head of CARE in Mogadishu. "They said they were being targeted. We feel security problems are also increasing."</p>
        <p>The increase in violence coincides with an announcement by the United States military authorities of a more aggressive policy in disarming the Somalis. The goal is to get rid of the vehicles known as "technicals," jeeps and trucks with automatic weapons mounted on them.</p>
        <p>Although this effort seems to have found success in small towns such as Baidoa and Bardera, it has had a different result in Mogadishu. Relief workers say that the removal of the armed jeeps and trucks from the streets has destroyed the hierarchy that the civil war had established.</p>
        <p>"During the first 15 days" after the American troops arrived, said Cedric Piralla, head of the Red Cross delegation in Mogadishu, "the Somalis were definitely impressed with this huge deployment of forces. But now they are much more confident.</p>
        <p>"The 'technical' was a means to loot," Mr. Piralla said. "It meant power. Now it is gone. Everyone has a Kalashnikov and everyone is equal. Now they kill with the Kalashnikov and everyone will retaliate. I am afraid the situation will deteriorate.</p>
        <p>"The Somalis no longer have any point of reference within their system," Mr. Piralla continued. "They are lost. They no longer have any structure to rely on. Their sphere of influence is limited to the end of their Kalashnikov."</p>
        <p>There are added levels of confusion about disarmament among both Somalis and relief workers. United States military spokesmen have said they will confiscate automatic weapons like Kalashnikovs and M16's only if they are visible. "We're not after every AK-47 in this town," Col. Fred Peck, the Marine spokesman, said. "Otherwise we'll be here forever."</p>
        <p>But there are some gaps between the policy as announced by the military command and actions taken by patrols.</p>
        <p>At Mogadishu airport, for example, marines allow visitors to check their weapons, which are then returned to them when they leave the area; at a checkpoint in the city, the same types of weapons are confiscated.  Breakdown in Communications</p>
        <p>At times, there are embarrassing breakdowns in communication. On Monday, a group of marines drove into the headquarters of the Information Ministry and confiscated guns, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenades and towed away an armed vehicle.</p>
        <p>But under an agreement between the American command and Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, one of the clan leaders, official Somali ministries can keep their vehicles and ammunition as long as they keep it within their compounds.</p>
        <p>Today the marines returned everything. "It was a mistake on our part," Colonel Peck said. "Someone exercising his own initiative. Apparently word did not get out on the street."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wynne-Pope of CARE said: "The headquarters liaison is excellent. It's the downward communication that's not good."</p>

        <p>Blasts at 2 Hotels With Marines</p>
        <p>ADEN, Yemen, Dec. 29 (AP) -- Two bombs exploded today at hotels where Marines were staying en route to Somalia, killing one person and wounding eight, the Government said. The Pentagon said no American personnel were harmed.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Bryan Whitman of the Army, said in Washington that "no U.S. military personnel were involved."</p>
        <p>Yemen, a republic of 12 million at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, is allowing American forces working in Somalia to use its air and sea installations.</p>
