        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Q &amp;A column on Nov. 1 contained an incomplete and potentially misleading discussion of shared electric meters.</p>
        <p>Responding to a question from a person who shares a gas and electric bill with the occupant of another apartment, and who wanted to know whether there must be a meter for each apartment to insure fairness, a Department of Buildings spokesman is reported to have stated that "there are no provisions in the city's electrical code that would prohibit an owner from putting two apartments on the same electric meter."</p>
        <p>While the department's statement may be technically correct as to the city's electrical code, the Q and A column should have pointed out that an owner cannot put two apartments on the same electric or gas meter unless the bill for such a shared meter is in the owner's name.</p>
        <p>Section 52 of the Public Service Law, as implemented by the New York State Public Service Commission in Sections 11.30 through 11.39 of Title 16 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, states unambiguously that owners are responsible for service measured through a shared meter.</p>
        <p>The Public Service Law requires that gas, electric and steam utilities investigate complaints from customers who receive service in rented dwellings that are measured by a shared meter where the meter registers service used in common areas or in other residential dwellings or commercial space.</p>
        <p>If a shared meter is found to exist, utilities are required to establish an account in the owner's name for service registered through such a meter and to rebill for past service.  KATHRYN C. BROWN Manhattan</p>
