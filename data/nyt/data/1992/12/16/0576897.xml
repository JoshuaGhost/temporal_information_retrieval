        <p>Rather than forcing the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman to come up with the $338.6 million purchase price for the New York Coliseum site, city and state officials are trying to strike a new deal with him.</p>
        <p>Through the development concern Boston Properties, Mr. Zuckerman is under contract to buy the 3.4-acre site on Columbus Circle, where he is to build a 2.1 million-square-foot, multi-towered office, apartment and retail complex called Columbus Center.</p>
        <p>A closing could have been scheduled as early as this month. But officials have not set a date while negotiations are under way.</p>
        <p>All that the participants will say is that Boston Properties is still committed to the project and that the talks concern an extension of the deal.</p>
        <p>It may be that officials do not wish to force Mr. Zuckerman's hand at a time when he is also trying to buy The Daily News, which could be an economic boon to New York if he decided to build a new color printing plant in the city.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether a new arrangement would simply delay the Columbus Center project until the real-estate market improves -- as happened with the Times Square Center project on 42d Street -- or whether the size and nature of the development would change again.</p>
        <p>Columbus Center was announced in 1985. Salomon Brothers, which was to have been the main tenant, withdrew in 1987. After lawsuits and public criticism, the building plans were significantly modified in 1988 and 1989.</p>
        <p>The last legal obstacle to the project was removed in June when a Federal appeals court ruled that the development would not violate the Federal Clean Air Act. Letter of Credit</p>
        <p>Since Sept. 21, when the deadline passed for further legal appeals, officials have been in a position to schedule a closing on the Coliseum and its adjoining office tower, 10 Columbus Circle. Should Mr. Zuckerman be unwilling or unable to purchase the property, officials could draw down a letter of credit at Citibank that served as a deposit. The letter of credit is worth $33.8 million, or 10 percent of the purchase price.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, who represents the area, said of Mr. Zuckerman: "He doesn't have financing. He lost his tenant. He's obviously not going to build the building. So he owes us $34 million."</p>
        <p>Boston Properties is committed to "proceed as soon as it is economically feasible," said Robert Selsam, vice president of the concern. Mr. Zuckerman's partner in Boston Properties is Edward H. Linde.</p>
        <p>"The objective of both parties is for the project to proceed, not to create arbitrary deadlines for each other," Mr. Selsam said. "We have, in fact, an approved project, with years of litigation having been cleared away."</p>
        <p>The director of real estate for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Susan Fine, said the discussions concerned "whether, and under what terms, we'd extend the transaction, in light of today's real-estate market."</p>
        <p>The M.T.A. owns the Coliseum through its subsidiary, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.</p>
        <p>The delay in resolving the Columbus Center deal effectively inhibits all but the most temporary re-use of the Coliseum, which has been largely empty since 1986. 'Tough Budget Year'</p>
        <p>Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who advocates reopening the Coliseum, said: "We're about to enter a tough budget year. It would be nice to know whether we're going to have these monies, or some alternative, or some revenue-generating use for this site."</p>
        <p>Ms. Eldridge, whose district office is at 10 Columbus Circle, said she understood that the Coliseum talks hinged in part on what happened at The News. But Ms. Fine said "there is no connection, in my mind," between the two issues.</p>
