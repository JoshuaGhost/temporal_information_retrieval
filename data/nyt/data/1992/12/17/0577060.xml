        <p>The United Nations Security Council began its fourth peacekeeping operation of the year today, sending about 7,500 troops, police and civilian administrators to monitor a cease-fire agreement in Mozambique, disarm rival armies and organize elections.</p>
        <p>The new force will be the 13th the United Nations is now deploying around the world and brings the number of blue-helmeted troops under its command to nearly 60,000.</p>

        <p>The United Nations Security Council began its fourth peacekeeping operation of the year today, sending about 7,500 troops, police and civilian administrators to monitor a cease-fire agreement in Mozambique, disarm rival armies and organize elections.</p>
        <p>The new force will be the 13th the United Nations is now deploying around the world and brings the number of blue-helmeted troops under its command to nearly 60,000.</p>
        <p>The force in Mozambique will oversee an accord ending 14 years of civil war signed in Rome on Oct. 4 by the Government of President Joaquim Chissano, and the Mozambqiue National Resistance, a rebel group known as Renamo, under Afonso Dhlakama. Seek to Organize Elections</p>
        <p>The United Nations troops will seek to disarm both sides, integrating portions of the two forces into a new national army, and organize free elections by next October.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the United Nations sent about 20,000 peacekeepers each to Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia, and sent a smaller force to Somalia.</p>
        <p>The new operation in Mozambique, which is estimated to cost about $330 million, comes at a time when the United Nations is facing severe money difficulties.</p>
        <p>The United Nations is currently owed some $1.2 billion by its member states, with the United States and Russia each owing about $410 million. Unpaid peacekeeping dues now total $642.5 million, with the United States owing $290 million.  U.N. to Guard Land Corridors</p>
        <p>In addition to disarming both sides and organizing elections, the new United Nations force will also take over protection of the transport corridors running across Mozamibque to the landlocked countries of Central Africa from the Malawian and Zimbabwean troops now guarding them.</p>
        <p>The United Nations insistence on full disarmament before elections are held in Mozambique reflects a bitter experience in Angola, officials said.</p>
        <p>Elections held in September with the goal of ending Angola's long civil war were disputed by the leader of the rebel Unita movement, Jonas Savimbi, and his fighters seized key towns from Government forces.</p>
