        <p>With the same fervor that helped build Taiwan's economic miracle, candidates are bustling about the island in preparation for landmark legislative elections on Saturday, vigorously plastering walls with posters, denouncing each other from sound trucks, bribing voters with gifts and cash, and in one case reportedly even trying to burn down a rival's headquarters.</p>
        <p>The campaigning is as chaotic as Taipei traffic, and it marks a sharp break from the orderly autocracy with which Taiwan was governed until a few years ago. The elections this week are widely regarded as a milestone in Taiwan's transition from a harshly repressive authoritarian system to a no-holds-barred democracy.</p>
        <p>This year for the first time, all legislators will be chosen by voters on Taiwan. Also for the first time, candidates are allowed to break the last taboo and demand that the Government renounce its claims to mainland China.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the elections may have their greatest effect not here -- for only 20 million people live on Taiwan -- but on mainland China, home to nearly 1.2 billion, where intellectuals increasingly look to Taiwan for inspiration. Some Chinese on the mainland see in Taiwan an example of how a repressive government based on Chinese culture can open up politically and turn toward a multiparty system.</p>
        <p>In this respect, Taiwan's growing democratization is an important subversive force on mainland China. The growing contacts across the Taiwan Strait mean that more and more mainland Chinese are aware that their cousins on Taiwan are able to curse their leaders, cast votes and engage in other mind-boggling activities.</p>
        <p>For the Kuomintang, the ruling party on Taiwan, the election will likely mean less control over the legislature, but at the same time it will provide a welcome dose of something that the Governments here and in Beijing have been short of: political legitimacy.</p>
        <p>"The most important consequence of the election is that the Kuomintang gets more legitimacy," said Antonio C. N. Chiang, a magazine publisher in Taipei. "In addition, it will change the power structure. The legislature can become more powerful. It will have more authority; it will be the only institution to have legitimacy."</p>
        <p>The presidency is still not an elective office. In 1996, when the present presidential term ends, it is expected that the president will be chosen by popular election for the first time.</p>
        <p>In this legislative election, 403 candidates are running for 161 seats, and the Kuomintang is almost certain to retain a solid majority. But the opposition Democratic Progressive Party is expected to improve its position, creating a more balanced two-party system.</p>
        <p>"This election is looking very negative for the Kuomintang," said Tim T. Y. Ting, a prominent poll taker. He said he expected the Kuomintang to win less than 60 percent of the total vote, which in Taiwan terms would be a crushing humiliation.</p>
        <p>A bad performance at the polls might well lead to a shuffle in the Cabinet, possibly including the dismissal of several mainland Chinese -- like Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun -- who fled here in 1949, when the Communists defeated the Kuomintang on the mainland. In any case, the election is expected to hasten the decline of the mainland emigres and the increasing dominance by native Taiwanese who feel little allegiance to the mainland.</p>
        <p>While the candidates are free to say what they want -- and many are fiercely critical of the Government -- there is little doubt that the political system is heavily tilted in favor of the Kuomintang. All the television stations, for example, are controlled by the Government, and the election rules are designed wherever possible to give an edge to the Kuomintang candidates.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there is a long tradition of vote-buying in Taiwan, with votes typically costing $20 to $100 each, and this tends to favor the governing party in part because it has far more money and resources. Sometimes candidates simply give out cash or gifts without any clear promise of a vote in return; other times, especially in rural areas, the voter must swear over the image of a folk god that he will vote for the candidate whose money he takes.</p>
