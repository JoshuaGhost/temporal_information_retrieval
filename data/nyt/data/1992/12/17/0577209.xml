        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is refreshing to see accolades for prison-based drug therapeutic communities in your Nov. 16 report. In your article, Dr. Harry K. Wexler attests to a success rate of 75 percent at the Stay'n Out therapeutic community at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility for those who complete three years of treatment. We can also vouch for its effectiveness for inmates who spend fewer than three years in the program. Those who enroll on release in the Stay'n Out after-care facility, Serendipity House, have an even higher success rate.</p>
        <p>Stay'n Out is used as a model for prison-based drug programs throughout the world. We, as coordinators of training, using immersion training techniques, have instructed corrections personnel from as far away as Norway. Gov. Ann Richards of Texas chose Stay'n Out to train key personnel who will open her state's new visions program, which will eventually serve 20,000 inmates.</p>

        <p>Stay'n Out is used as a model for prison-based drug programs throughout the world. We, as coordinators of training, using immersion training techniques, have instructed corrections personnel from as far away as Norway. Gov. Ann Richards of Texas chose Stay'n Out to train key personnel who will open her state's new visions program, which will eventually serve 20,000 inmates.</p>
        <p>The New York State Department of Correction Services is expanding drug programs inside its prisons. But instead of turning to Stay'n Out, which has 14 years of success behind it, the department chooses to develop its own substance-abuse treatment programs. Inmates in the department program are guaranteed an early release from prison if they complete the six-month program.</p>
        <p>Stay'n Out residents receive no special consideration for parole, and they are not eligible for early parole. Perhaps the more honest motive of enrolling in Stay'n Out to get real treatment, rather than to get out early, underlies our phenomenal success. VASCO GURAJ, ERIC LOTZE  Staten Island, Nov. 25, 1992</p>
