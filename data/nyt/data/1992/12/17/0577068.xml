        <p>An $8 million gift to provide permanent housing for thousands of homeless adults in New York City has been announced in a joint effort by 12 foundations.</p>
        <p>The money will go to 17 neighborhood organizations to help build or renovate apartments and to provide residents with health and counseling services and job training. The objective is to aid homeless adults with special needs, particularly people with AIDS, mental illness or a history of alcohol and drug abuse.</p>

        <p>An $8 million gift to provide permanent housing for thousands of homeless adults in New York City has been announced in a joint effort by 12 foundations.</p>
        <p>The money will go to 17 neighborhood organizations to help build or renovate apartments and to provide residents with health and counseling services and job training. The objective is to aid homeless adults with special needs, particularly people with AIDS, mental illness or a history of alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
        <p>The money is being channeled through the Corporation for Supportive Housing, which is based in Manhattan and operates nationally. It has similar housing experiments in Chicago and the San Francisco Bay area, and it is about to begin a statewide housing program in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>In New York, the money will enable the community organizations, with relatively small sums of up-front money, to secure loans for housing projects. It will also help the organizations qualify for low-income housing subsidies from Federal, state and city governments.</p>
        <p>Among the foundations providing the grant are the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which contributed $4 million, and the Ford Foundation, which gave $2 million. Another $2 million was given by 10 other foundations.</p>
        <p>Mayor Dinkins, in welcoming the move during a luncheon at the Ford Foundation on Tuesday, said that the city, with the help of the state and private organizations, had made headway in providing housing for groups of people who might otherwise be in hospitals, temporary shelters on the streets. He estimated that it had created 1,000 beds this year and 3,400 since 1986.</p>
        <p>The Corporation for Supportive Housing identifies those community groups that show an ability to care for the homeless, but that cannot secure money from the usual commercial sources.</p>
        <p>"The corporation supplies the 'glue money' that should enable community groups to build 5,000 housing units in the next five years," said Julie Sandorf, the organization's president. "We are out to prove the skeptics are wrong. We have the answers; the solutions are out there. We need only to muster the financial resources to underwrite the best of community-based efforts."</p>
        <p>The other foundations that contributed sums ranging from $25,000 to $120,000 were the Commonwealth Fund, the Rockefeller, Altman and Ittleson foundations, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the New York Community Trust, CFDA-Vogue Initiative/NYC Aids Fund, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company and Chemical Bank foundations, and the Rhodebeck Charitable Trust.</p>
