        <p>We Should . . . (a Lie)  Living Theater 272 East Third Street Manhattan Through Feb. 16 By Kenneth Bernard; directed by Robert Press; lighting by Craig Kennedy; costumes by Daniel Cole; original music by Roberto Pace; assistant director and stage manager, Dena Kazmin; producer, Judith Malina; French text translation, Richard Wilbur; French dialect coach, Joan Templeton. Presented by the Living Theater New Directors Series.  WITH: Joanie Fritz, Gene, Lois Kagan, Kevin D. Mayes, Victoria Murphy, Joe Pichette and Michael St. Clair.</p>
        <p>One has to suspect that Kenneth Bernard's "We Should . . . (a Lie)" is more comprehensible when it is read than when it is seen and heard. Still, it is so intelligent, quick and ironic that it ignites a viewer's imagination.</p>

        <p>We Should . . . (a Lie)  Living Theater 272 East Third Street Manhattan Through Feb. 16 By Kenneth Bernard; directed by Robert Press; lighting by Craig Kennedy; costumes by Daniel Cole; original music by Roberto Pace; assistant director and stage manager, Dena Kazmin; producer, Judith Malina; French text translation, Richard Wilbur; French dialect coach, Joan Templeton. Presented by the Living Theater New Directors Series.  WITH: Joanie Fritz, Gene, Lois Kagan, Kevin D. Mayes, Victoria Murphy, Joe Pichette and Michael St. Clair.</p>
        <p>One has to suspect that Kenneth Bernard's "We Should . . . (a Lie)" is more comprehensible when it is read than when it is seen and heard. Still, it is so intelligent, quick and ironic that it ignites a viewer's imagination.</p>
        <p>In this play, as in his increasingly appreciated short stories, Mr. Bernard can change one's perceptions and shatter emotions from phrase to phrase, and he has an unerring instinct for the dramatic possibilities in philosophical questions that have troubled people for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Here a group of actors rehearses Racine's "Phedre," itself a meditation on Euripides' terrifying "Hippolytus." The attraction of such a situation for someone of Mr. Bernard's wit is obvious. As the rehearsing actors remind themselves, "this is a play about monsters," and as they try to flesh out the Racine characters -- or force them into more humane dimensions -- all are slowly overwhelmed by the disaster that destroyed the house of Theseus when that mythical king's wife Phaedra falsely claimed she had been ravished by her stepson, Hippolytus.</p>
        <p>The different actors' varying perceptions of the Racine play, its characters and its moral issues are all sparks for Mr. Bernard's verbal explosions, and great intellectual fun. And the members of this cast -- especially Michael St. Clair as Phaedra and Kevin D. Mayes as Hippolytus -- deserve the outburst of applause they get; to a remarkable degree they keep the audience aware of the intricate mental gymnastics the playwright is performing.</p>
        <p>They are not always helped by Robert Press's direction. Occasionally he has inspired notions of how to illuminate the plot by simply letting the audience see the implications of what characters are saying. But on the whole he flattens the play's layered ironies with exaggerated and even crude depictions of its violent and sexual elements, exercises that call attention to his intrusions and distract it from the play itself.</p>
