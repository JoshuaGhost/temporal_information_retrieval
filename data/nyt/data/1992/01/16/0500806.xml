        <p>The judge presiding over a trial to determine the liability of four New York State officials in the 1971 Attica prison uprising said today that a verdict could be announced while he was away on vacation, reversing a decision he made on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Judge John T. Elfvin -- who has overseen this landmark case since 1975 and had said that any verdict reached by the jury would be sealed until he returned from Barbados on Feb. 10 -- announced just before leaving for the Caribbean today that the jury could deliver its verdicts to a magistrate who will preside in his absence. The judge's about-face followed objections from lawyers for the 1,281 former inmates who filed a civil-liability suit against New York State officials and lawyers representing the four defendants.</p>

The judge's about-face followed objections from lawyers for the 1,281 former inmates who filed a civil-liability suit against New York State officials and lawyers representing the four defendants.</p>
        <p>But because jurors have asked to rehear extensive testimony from the three-month trial, Michael Deutsch, a lawyer for the inmates, predicted that verdicts on any of the four defendants were at least a week away.</p>
