        <p>The stolen rental car that the police said two men used to abduct and rape a 15-year-old girl on Tuesday was found yesterday in Bushwick, a largely residential, high-crime area in north Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Two officers who were handing out sketches of the suspects found the four-door white Toyota Camry just before noon, parked on Bushwick Avenue between Furman and Granite Streets, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Peter Berry. The car and its license plate number, ZNY143, matched the description that the victim had given to the police.</p>

        <p>The attack is being investigated as a bias incident because the victim, who is white, said her assailants were two black men who said they had chosen her because she was "white and perfect."</p>
