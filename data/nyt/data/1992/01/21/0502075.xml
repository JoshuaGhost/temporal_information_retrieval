        <p>A TELEVISION program being offered to local stations around the country would combine elements of traditional talk shows with the buy-it-now sales pitches of home-shopping channels. If it enters production this fall, the program would be the latest in a spate of new media ventures that blur the line between editorial content and advertising.</p>
        <p>The hourlong daytime program, called "Day-to-Day Live," is being presented to station programmers this week in New Orleans, at the 29th annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. Besides carrying conventional commercials, 12 minutes during each hour, as many as four of the seven segments in each show would feature guests who laced their interviews with pitches for merchandise like books, clothing or cosmetics. Toll-free telephone numbers for ordering would flash onto the screen.</p>

        <p>A TELEVISION program being offered to local stations around the country would combine elements of traditional talk shows with the buy-it-now sales pitches of home-shopping channels. If it enters production this fall, the program would be the latest in a spate of new media ventures that blur the line between editorial content and advertising.</p>
        <p>The hourlong daytime program, called "Day-to-Day Live," is being presented to station programmers this week in New Orleans, at the 29th annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. Besides carrying conventional commercials, 12 minutes during each hour, as many as four of the seven segments in each show would feature guests who laced their interviews with pitches for merchandise like books, clothing or cosmetics. Toll-free telephone numbers for ordering would flash onto the screen.</p>
        <p>An added payoff for stations carrying the show: a cut of product sales in their local markets.</p>
        <p>"What would happen if Oprah Winfrey had an author on and turned and said, 'Now we have an opportunity for you to transact?' " Richard (Ritch) Colbert, the senior executive vice president of domestic television for ITC Entertainment, asked yesterday in a telephone interview from New Orleans. "By providing the viewer an opportunity to interact with television, and immediately transact, it fulfills television's promise. And I'm not saying that as a sales guy."</p>
        <p>ITC, a television production and distribution company best known for "The Muppet Show," would produce "Day-to-Day Live" with the Alliance Group, a television marketing company, and the Home Shopping Network, the shop-at-home cable network, with annual sales exceeding $1 billion.</p>
        <p>The program is intended to be shown, starting in September, during a one-hour slot between 9 A.M. and noon, Eastern time, for an audience primarily of women aged 25 to 54.</p>
        <p>Media directors at large advertising agencies were initially intrigued by the idea, but expressed misgivings yesterday about whether the show would seem like one long Ginsu knife commercial.</p>
        <p>"It's definitely pushing the edge of the envelope," said Arnie Semsky, the executive vice president and director of media and programming services at BBDO Worldwide in New York. "Certain clients will find this a good environment; others won't go near it."</p>
        <p>Marcella Rosen, the executive vice president and managing director of media services at Ayer Inc. in New York, called the program "an interesting concept" and said, "You can't get much closer to the point of purchase than to offer a sale as a person is talking about a product."</p>
        <p>Yet, she added, the program's success depends on its execution. "The biggest risk is whether they'll choose who's on the program by what will sell, rather than who makes the most interesting program," she said.</p>
        <p>Kathy Ring, the vice president and media director at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, agreed. "Will the viewer perceive this as an entertaining show with an opportunity to buy, or get additional information about, a product?" she asked. "Or will the viewer see this as just another home-shopping program?"</p>
        <p>The producers recognize those concerns, according to Mr. Colbert. "This is not paid advertising," he said, meaning that guests cannot pay in order to be interviewed by the show's co-hosts, Gloria Loring, an actress, and Bob Circosta, a host from the Home Shopping Network.</p>
        <p>"If you don't have a program that can retain the highest level of viewers," he added, "you don't have a program."</p>
        <p>Since the early days of television, when incessant "plugs," or paid mentions of products, led to a crackdown, there had been strict separation of programming and advertising. That weakened during the Reagan Administration, when "infomercials," program-length commercials that mimic television shows, were allowed.</p>
        <p>Also blurring the lines are conventional television or radio commercials, 30 or 60 seconds long, that simulate talk shows or news programs. The most castigated in that genre are television spots for the Vaseline Intensive Care line of lotions, created by McCann-Erickson, that feature Joan Lunden, a co-host of ABC's "Good Morning America."</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosen said "Day-to-Day Live" would likely be "obvious as what it is, not promotion masquerading as editorials."</p>
        <p>Given the enormous amounts of air time to fill, "advertisers are finding there's more they can do," said Mr. Semsky of BBDO. "And some of that blurs the line, like advertorials in print media," which are advertisements in newspapers and magazines that ape the appearances of news and feature articles.</p>
        <p>ITC hopes at least 100 stations will sign up for "Day-to-Day Live," Mr. Colbert said. Many programs offered at the convention, the television industry's annual sales bazaar for new shows, do not make it into station line-ups because of production problems, high costs or lookalike formats that inhibit prospective buyers.</p>
        <p>As an additional incentive to encourage stations to sign, he added, they would get 5 percent of the total sales from merchandise sold in their local viewing areas. That would be besides the revenues they would get from selling 8 of the 12 commercial minutes in the show. ITC would get the revenues from selling the remaining 4 minutes, as well as an unspecified percentage of the revenues generated by merchandise sales.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING</p>
