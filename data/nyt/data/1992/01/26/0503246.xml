        <p>THE HUMORIST SAM Levenson used to tell of a little boy who reported that all the children in his class had been asked to stand up and do a turn on their first day at school. "And what did you do, Johnny?" asked his parents. Replied the boy: "I vomited."</p>
        <p>This homely anecdote convulsed audiences because (a) children do it all too often in real life, and (b) the verb</p>

        <p>THE HUMORIST SAM Levenson used to tell of a little boy who reported that all the children in his class had been asked to stand up and do a turn on their first day at school. "And what did you do, Johnny?" asked his parents. Replied the boy: "I vomited."</p>
        <p>This homely anecdote convulsed audiences because (a) children do it all too often in real life, and (b) the verb</p>
        <p>to vomit</p>
        <p>packs such a punch.</p>
        <p>When George Bush, during his state visit to Japan, was afflicted with "stomach flu," as White House aides called it, or "intestinal flu" as it was called more formally, or "gastroenteritis" as preferred by Lawrence K. Altman, M.D., medical correspondent of The New York Times, many radio and television news readers shied away from the distasteful verb to describe what the President did. First reports were that he "</p>
        <p>was taken ill</p>
        <p>and collapsed" or "became</p>
        <p>sick to his stomach</p>
        <p>and fainted"; later, the broadcasters added that he had</p>
        <p>thrown up</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Print reporters were more inclined to come up with the hard word. When Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, announced that the President "was feeling weak and was helped to the floor by Secret Service agents," a reporter introduced the V-word: "Was the President nauseous when he slumped to the floor, or was there any vomiting?" Mr. Fitzwater, being helped to the truth by inquiring journalists, said: "Yes, he was nauseous. He did vomit just before he slumped to the floor."</p>
        <p>But he adopted the questioner's use of</p>
        <p>nauseous</p>
        <p>, which most dictionaries say means "causing nausea or disgust; sickening." (Pronounce it NAW-shus, not NAW-zee-us.)</p>
        <p>Nausea</p>
        <p>is rooted in "seasickness," from the same Greek root as</p>
        <p>nautical</p>
        <p>; for years, good usagists have insisted that the feeling you get before vomiting should be</p>
        <p>nauseated</p>
        <p>, not</p>
        <p>nauseous</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>As a card-carrying lexicographer and self-styled usagist, I always say, "I am</p>
        <p>nauseated</p>
        <p>," before clapping a handkerchief over my mouth and racing to talk to Ralph on the big white phone, but I don't know anybody else who says that. They all say, "Gawd, I feel</p>
        <p>nauseous</p>
        <p>," or offer a telegraphic "</p>
        <p>Nauseous, gonna go whoops</p>
        <p>," and they actually take offense when I correct them with "No, you are</p>
        <p>nauseated</p>
        <p>"; in one instance, my lap then became the target of a power boot. Since that time, I have accepted</p>
        <p>nauseous</p>
        <p>as a synonym for</p>
        <p>nauseated</p>
        <p>, and when I need a word to denote "causing nausea," I rely on</p>
        <p>disgusting</p>
        <p>. I realize this caving-in to common usage is permissive and descriptive --</p>
        <p>nauseous</p>
        <p>to prescriptivists -- but it has saved me from the fallout of upchucking friends.</p>
        <p>The slightly green reader will note my use of such modern euphemisms as</p>
        <p>boot, upchuck</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>talk to Ralph on the big white phone</p>
        <p>, as well as the Shakespearean favorite</p>
        <p>puke</p>
        <p>; I might have turned to a dignified-sounding</p>
        <p>regurgitate</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>reverse peristalsis</p>
        <p>, tried the latest</p>
        <p>hurl</p>
        <p>, or added</p>
        <p>tossing your cookies, blowing your doughnuts</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>losing your lunch</p>
        <p>. More modern power booters use</p>
        <p>driving the porcelain bus</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>laughing at the carpet</p>
        <p>; my personal choice in describing the embarrassing act when it happens to me is</p>
        <p>yawning in Technicolor</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Probably the preferred slang verb to describe the evacuation of the stomach was used by Johnny Carson just after the episode involving the President: "If you had to eat raw fish while you looked at Lee Iacocca, you'd</p>
        <p>barf</p>
        <p>too."  ON BEING LAYERED</p>
        <p>LAYERING</p>
        <p>IS IN. THIS LOCUtion -- not to be confused with</p>
        <p>lawyering</p>
        <p>, or "making it hard to sue and impossible to understand" -- has taken hold in several industries.</p>
        <p>Vidal Sassoon, the London hairdresser, sent ripples through the barbering dodge with his geometric, layered hair styles in the 1960's; we still see people with that organized shagginess shaping their heads today. The description soon dropped from the head to the body: since 1976, when Newsweek reported that Sonia Rykiel "continued her layered sweater look over Bermuda shorts," the</p>
        <p>layered look</p>
        <p>-- big skirts with tight pants, tiers of fabric, one color on top of the other, men's shirts over women's blouses over kids' pajamas -- has been a fashion staple. Lately, according to my Times Magazine colleague Carrie Donovan, the</p>
        <p>layered look</p>
        <p>has been overtaken by a</p>
        <p>put-together</p>
        <p>look, less rumpled, not as defiant a statement as in the old hippie-reminiscent days; though layering continues, it is not all that chic.</p>
        <p>Ah, but it is becoming the hot new locution in another world. In the mid-70's, a different sense of the term appeared in Business Week: "Because of the</p>
        <p>layered</p>
        <p>organizational design, it is hard to get feedback," complained a lumber company executive, frustrated at the impenetrability of government trade regulators. That meaning of</p>
        <p>layering</p>
        <p>-- bureaucratic buffers -- lay dormant under a layer of feminist fashion until recently.</p>
        <p>A White House official was quoted by Ann Devroy of The Washington Post as saying that a new communications director was going to be chosen by the new chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner. But "the same official cautioned that because someone new is coming in 'does not mean David Demarest is going out.' " Ms Devroy explained that "David F. Demarest Jr. is the current communications director and is likely to leave or '</p>
        <p>be layered</p>
        <p>,' as one source put it yesterday -- given lesser duties and a different title."</p>
        <p>I had heard of such layering in political circles but never saw it in print. "I first heard it in the Reagan Administration," Ms Devroy recalls. "They never fired anyone either. They just put a super-whatever on top. When they put somebody else in below, they call it</p>
        <p>sandwiching</p>
        <p>."</p>
        <p>Despite the indignity, executives or bureaucrats being deprived of an in-box are happy to keep at least the shadow of their jobs in tight times. Keep your eye on</p>
        <p>layering</p>
        <p>, an important new bureaucratic management tool.</p>
