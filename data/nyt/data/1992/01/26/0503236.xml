        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A footnote to Walter Goodman's essay "For $64,000: Who Lost in the Big Fix?"  [ Jan. 5 ]  about the "American Experience" documentary on the quiz-show scandals of the 1950's. As a junior representative of the sponsors on a number of quiz shows (i.e., an ad agency employee), I was pretty close to what was going on, although not a participant.</p>
        <p>One aspect of this period was truly tragic. Those of us in a position to know were sure that the contestant Charles Van Doren, far from having to be coached with answers, was in fact made to believe that the quiz show "21" would be more exciting if he held back and agonized before answering. There was no question that he knew the answers: he was an expert in the field of literature, and the questions were nowhere near difficult enough to make him stumble.</p>
        <p>But we believed that the producers convinced Van Doren that they couldn't afford to take chances, and he shruggingly allowed himself to be exposed to material that he undoubtedly knew anyway.</p>
        <p>Van Doren's only real moral lapse was trivial: he succumbed to pressure to create suspense by hesitating and seeming uncertain. It seemed then, and still does now, that he paid a terrible price for something show people do every day. RICHARD A. LUKIN New York  QUIZ-SHOW SCANDALS</p>
