        <p>"It doesn't make sense when a player like CHUCK PERSON gets 309,049 votes and Dominique doesn't get half that many," said Hawks vice president LEE DOUGLAS</p>
        <p>Person, who plays for the Indiana Pacers, finished fifth in the voting at forward, behind CHARLES BARKLEY of Philadelphia, LARRY BIRD of Boston, SCOTTIE PIPPEN of Chicago and Person's Indiana teammate, DETLEF SCHREMPF.</p>
        <p>So far the league has released the names of only the top 10 vote-getters, but Wilkins's count is due tomorrow.(AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASKETBALL</p>
