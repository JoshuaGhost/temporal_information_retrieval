        <p>You don't have to be as fascinated with Norman Mailer as Norman Mailer always has been or as David Frost seems to be to enjoy their conversation tonight. Mr. Mailer gives good talk. There is a high intelligence operating along with a sometimes original perspective; at his most engaging, he manages to be off the wall and on the mark at the same time. And his language has a way of rescuing his thoughts from drifting out into space.</p>
        <p>"Talking With David Frost," at 9 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, scarcely touches on the author as author. You will hear no plug for his latest novel, "Harlot's Ghost." Instead, Mr. Frost draws him out on some of the more notorious episodes of his eventful life, including the time he stabbed his wife and the part he played in the parole of Jack Henry Abbott, the criminal turned writer who murdered a young man soon after his release. Mr. Mailer is rueful. As his 69th birthday approaches, he also seems somewhat chastened about other onetime enthusiasms, like promiscuous sex, violence, alcohol and marijuana.</p>

        <p>You don't have to be as fascinated with Norman Mailer as Norman Mailer always has been or as David Frost seems to be to enjoy their conversation tonight. Mr. Mailer gives good talk. There is a high intelligence operating along with a sometimes original perspective; at his most engaging, he manages to be off the wall and on the mark at the same time. And his language has a way of rescuing his thoughts from drifting out into space.</p>
        <p>"Talking With David Frost," at 9 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, scarcely touches on the author as author. You will hear no plug for his latest novel, "Harlot's Ghost." Instead, Mr. Frost draws him out on some of the more notorious episodes of his eventful life, including the time he stabbed his wife and the part he played in the parole of Jack Henry Abbott, the criminal turned writer who murdered a young man soon after his release. Mr. Mailer is rueful. As his 69th birthday approaches, he also seems somewhat chastened about other onetime enthusiasms, like promiscuous sex, violence, alcohol and marijuana.</p>
        <p>Gone white now, the somewhat cherubic-looking guest sits across a small table from his host in what appears to be a public room in a hotel. He looks well fed and good-humored, and he proves as ready as ever to discourse on his notions about big subjects. After telling Mr. Frost, "I think I can say I believe there's a God," he gives a Maileresque description that does not fit the title of Almighty. His God turns out to be an overworked, witty Fellow, "who is just doing the best that He or She can."</p>
        <p>That "She" may startle women, who are not accustomed to having their sex paid so elevated a tribute by a man noted for his slanging matches with representatives of the women's movement. Still, he maintains his reputation here by calling feminists "mean-spirited" and "full of cant." He says, "Ms. magazine to me is a totalitarian sheet." But he grants, as an aside, that feminism has valuable aspects, a concession he might not have allowed a decade or two ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frost also brings out the latest permutations in Mr. Mailer's thinking about sex, always a favorite subject. He still opposes birth control because he believes it gets in the way of the sexual act, but he favors the idea of a woman's taking a pill to abort pregnancy after conception. That would be murder, he acknowledges, but "I think if we're allowed to murder anyone at all, it has to be someone who is as close to us as possible."</p>
        <p>He says he sees AIDS as just the latest penalty for promiscuity, although he seems to have pleasing recollections of the 1960's, when young folks went partying with the prospect of one-night stands. "People were happier," he says. "They were wilder. They were crazier. They were more fun." When he warns now that there is no such thing as safe sex, he is talking about emotional as well as physical hazards.</p>
        <p>The political news tonight is that Mr. Mailer is not going to run for President this year. But if he did, he indicates, he would call on American capitalists to produce better products and do less marketing and advertising. Mr. Mailer, who has produced his share of good products, demonstrates tonight that he has not lost his knack for self-advertising. '20/20'  ABC Tonight at 10</p>
        <p>Most of tonight's edition of "20/20" is given to the subject of "victim empathy sessions" for convicted rapists in the Northwest Correctional Center in St. Albans, Vt. The idea, as the reporter, Bob Brown, explains, is to "reprogram" the men and enable them to "get rid of deviant sexual tendencies" by forcing them to imagine themselves on the receiving end of sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>At the center of attention here is Scott Guy, who is serving two to five years for raping his girlfriend. He seems penitent, but as he tells of his "highest risk factors," he sounds as though he is feeding back to his therapists what they want to hear: "Manipulating women for my own needs. Viewing women as sexual objects."</p>
        <p>One therapist grants that some convicts become "quite therapized" and learn to use the right words. But the authorities cite sharply reduced figures of recidivism for rapists who have gone through the program and continue therapy after their release. Whether the technique works or not, it makes for some strong television scenes. Talking With David Frost  An interview with the novelist Norman Mailer, produced by Wallace Westfeldt for David Paradine Television Inc. in association with WETA, Washington; John M. Florescu and David Frost, executive producers. Tonight at 9 on Channels 13 and 49.</p>
