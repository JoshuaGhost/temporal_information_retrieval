        <p>Just when it appeared that the Yankees had worked a deal to trade veteran second baseman Steve Sax and the bulk of his $12.4 million contract to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Melido Perez, the trade appears to have fizzled.</p>
        <p>Hours after saying that the deal was set and awaiting only the approval of the Yankees' hierarchy, White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler announced a sudden turnaround last night.</p>
        <p>"The deal is dead," Schueler said yesterday from his home in California, speaking of the Yankees' attempt to get a second major leaguer in the deal. "It's over."</p>
        <p>Yankee General Manager Gene Michael, away from his Yankee Stadium office during business hours yesterday, did not return phone calls to his home last night.  Contract a Stumbling Block</p>
        <p>During a winter of little activity by the Yankees, Michael has spent much of the off season trying to move Sax, the team's only .300 hitter last season, in order to make room at second base for Pat Kelly, who was promoted to the Yankees last May and who at 24 years of age is seven years younger than Sax. Sax turns 32 at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>The Yankees ran into major impediments seeking to make trades at the owners' winter meetings because of Sax's contract. Michael, though, appeared to have struck a deal with the White Sox after agreeing to pay at least $1.5 million of the Sax contract, which still has $10.9 million due the player (Sax had received a $1.5 million signing bonus when he signed what was technically a four-year contract extension on Dec. 2, 1990).</p>
        <p>The White Sox were apparently willing to include in the deal a minor league player; one official said it was a 95 percent certainty that the second player would have been a minor league pitcher. But the Yankees wanted a second major leaguer to go along with the 25-year-old Perez, a younger brother of the Yankees' Pascual Perez, also a right-hander.</p>
        <p>Though Schueler would not reveal the name of the player the Yankees sought, the Yankees' desire for a third baseman is well known; the White Sox have an accomplished backup in Craig Grebeck.</p>
        <p>The trade would have filled two outstanding wishes on the Yankees' shopping list. The team also entered the winter months shopping for a starting pitcher. Perez, who started and relieved last season, is available because the White Sox signed Kirk McCaskill as a free agent from California and Perez lost his position in the starting rotation.</p>
        <p>A Sax trade was not the only significant moves that did not come off for the Yankees this week.  Steinbrenner Situation on Hold</p>
        <p>There was no movement on the George Steinbrenner situation either, as the majority owner's bid to regain his position as the team's general managing partner rested in limbo. That is because the two lawsuits that emanated from his agreement 18 months ago to surrender operating control of the team are still alive and as long as they remain active, no negotiations for a return can begin, according to Commissioner Fay Vincent.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner had indicated that the suits might have been disposed of by Thursday, at the earliest, or by the beginning of next week.</p>
        <p>For that reason, Vincent said late yesterday afternoon, "I'm expecting a quiet weekend. As I understand it, the lawyers are working on it."  BASEBALL</p>
