        <p>A gynecologist was arrested in Manhattan yesterday on charges of offering $1,500 in cash and a watch to a state Health Department investigator who was looking into complaints about the care women had received at the doctor's East Side office.</p>
        <p>The doctor, Ben Thamrong, 49 years old, was to be arraigned on bribery charges last night.</p>
        <p>Officials said that Dr. Thamrong's license was suspended in New Jersey in 1990 and that he then began practicing in New York, where he does have a license.  'Suspected Patient Harm'</p>
        <p>Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the New York State Health Department, said, "We do have some cases of suspected patient harm or negligence at his hands." But he said that he could not discuss the details, citing the state whistle-blower law, which is intended to protect people who come forward with complaints.</p>
        <p>Officials said that Dr. Thamrong had come to the attention of New Jersey medical officials twice in the last five years.</p>
        <p>In the first instance, Dr. Thamrong, who had an office in Paterson, N.J., was convicted of Medicaid fraud in Passaic County Superior Court in September 1989, Mr. Slocum said. The case involved 52 claims he submitted for abortions and postpartum services. Medicaid paid him $4,983.44, which he accepted as payment in full. But the prosecution charged that the patients on whom he had operated paid him $7,105 of their own money.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thamrong was fined $10,000 and was sentenced to four years' probation, along with 500 hours of community service.</p>
        <p>The second instance, Mr. Slocum said, began in 1990 and ended with a five-year suspension from practice. Papers filed in connection with the suspension contend that Dr. Thamrong performed an abortion in his office on a woman who was more than 12 weeks pregnant, which is against the law in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The authorities in New York could have taken action against him for the Medicaid fraud conviction, Mr. Slocum said. But the Medicaid case would not necessarily have led to the revocation of his license.</p>
        <p>New York officials said they were more concerned about patient-care issues raised in New Jersey. "So we decided the better course was to investigate his practice here, to see if these same kinds of abuses were happening," Mr. Slocum said. 'Hint of a Payoff'</p>
        <p>After reviewing Dr. Thamrong's records, an investigator from the Office of Professional Medical Conduct, Paul Scher, went to his office on the second floor of an apartment building at 141 East 55th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. Dr. Thamrong gave "the hint of a payoff looming," Mr. Slocum said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scher went back a few days later. The doctor handed him a gift-wrapped box containing $1,000 and a Rolex watch. Mr. Slocum said he did not know whether it was a real Rolex or a street-corner counterfeit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scher told the police what had happened and the authorities decided to send him back again, this time wearing a recording device. That time, Dr. Thamrong gave him another $500, Mr. Slocum said.</p>
