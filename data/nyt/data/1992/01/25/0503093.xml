        <p>Although Federal health officials say tuberculosis is out of control in the United States, they take some comfort in the fact that the disease is not particularly contagious.</p>
        <p>Certainly the spread of tuberculosis is not comparable to that of influenza, which can strike in explosive epidemics. Nor is it like outbreaks of measles and chicken pox, in which sick people can infect nearly everyone they meet who has not already had the disease.</p>
        <p>The tuberculosis bacterium spreads in droplets dispersed through the air by coughing, and studies have shown that the risk of catching it rises only in close and prolonged contact with a sick person. Infection From Close Contact</p>
        <p>On average, people have a 50 percent chance of becoming infected if they spend 8 hours a day for 6 months or 24 hours a day for 2 months working or living with someone who is sick with tuberculosis, said Dr. Lee B. Reichman. He is the president-elect of the American Lung Association in New York City and an expert in lung diseases at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark.</p>
        <p>But for reasons doctors do not understand, some people seem to spread the tuberculosis bacillus more easily than others do and some people may be more susceptible to infection. In some cases, exposure in a closed environment for even a few hours has resulted in infection, officials with the Federal Centers for Disease Control here say. But some people seem to escape infection even when other people living in the same household become infected.</p>
        <p>And most people who become infected with tuberculosis will not fall ill with the active form of the disease. In fact, millions of Americans are infected with tuberculosis but have no sign of disease. Their immune systems control the latent infection and protect them from falling ill with the coughs, fevers, night sweats, weight loss and other symptoms that can be part of active tuberculosis, which often involves the occurrence of cavities in the lungs and the scarring of the lung tissue and can spread to other parts of the body. Especially in cases of latent infection, doctors use skin tests, chest X-rays and cultures of sputum to help determine whether someone is infected.</p>
        <p>People with a latent tuberculosis infection do not spread the bacillus to others. But they have about a 10 percent lifetime chance that they will develop active tuberculosis. About half of those who develop tuberculosis do so in the first two years after developing a latent infection, said Dr. Samuel Dooley, a tuberculosis expert at the C.D.C.</p>
        <p>Doctors do not know precisely what factors trigger a progression from latent to active tuberculosis. One factor that seems important is change in the immune system, which weakens with age and with many ailments. Cancer treatment and drugs to prevent rejection of organ transplants also weaken it, but the biggest problem is infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>Damage to the immune system from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus can greatly accelerate the development of active tuberculosis, principally from a previously acquired latent infection. AIDS seems to increase the risk of developing tuberculosis to about 10 percent a year, said Dr. Reichman, the American Lung Association official. AIDS Epidemic a Factor</p>
        <p>In an outbreak in San Francisco, the rate was considerably higher in just a few months and the spread much swifter among people whose immune systems were suppressed by H.I.V.</p>
        <p>The spread of the AIDS epidemic is bound to aggravate the tuberculosis problem. If more people with the virus and AIDS develop active tuberculosis, there will be more people to spread tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
        <p>About one percent of AIDS patients throughout the country have tuberculosis, according to data that epidemiologists at the C.D.C. have tabulated by comparing registries for AIDS and tuberculosis, Dr. Dooley said. Experts do not know how many people infected with the virus are also infected with tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>About four percent of those with tuberculosis nationwide have AIDS, Dr. Dooley said. Variations With Area</p>
        <p>But the percentages vary widely with the geographic area. In a survey of 20 tuberculosis clinics around the country, the median figure for those infected with H.I.V. was 3.4 percent. But that included Honolulu, where no one was infected, and New York City, where 46 percent had the virus.</p>
        <p>The common form of tuberculosis can nearly always be cured if patients comply with prescribed therapy. But health officials are alarmed about the spread of drug resistant forms, which can be difficult to treat or even deadly. Many patients infected with the drug resistant strains can be cured, but the treatment must be given promptly and even then it does not always succeed.</p>
        <p>Death rates exceeding 80 percent have been reported for the drug resistant form in some outbreaks reported by Federal officials. But doctors said they did not know whether the death rate was so high because of delay in recognizing and treating the resistant form or because such strains were deadlier.</p>
        <p>At a meeting here this week, experts said there was an urgent need for studies to determine the answer to that and many other questions about the resurgence of tuberculosis.</p>
