        <p>THE shop sort of announces its personality as soon as you walk in the door:</p>
        <p>"Wonderful old paint," reads the tag on a country pie safe, "$995." "Home-style delicious, $4.50," says a sign by some jars of applesauce. "Authentic country frame and photo, dated 1924, $225" catches one's eye. A Boston-terrier-shaped iron doorstop -- "$255 (rare)" -- stands on a table; another stands in the window.</p>

        <p>THE shop sort of announces its personality as soon as you walk in the door:</p>
        <p>"Wonderful old paint," reads the tag on a country pie safe, "$995." "Home-style delicious, $4.50," says a sign by some jars of applesauce. "Authentic country frame and photo, dated 1924, $225" catches one's eye. A Boston-terrier-shaped iron doorstop -- "$255 (rare)" -- stands on a table; another stands in the window.</p>
        <p>Then there's the lineup of vintage soda bottles with names like Skipper, Crass, Whistle, Patio and Variety Club. They're $20 each.</p>
        <p>"Aren't they just great and graphic?" said Jenny Eiger, the owner of Home Town, a new shop at 131 Wooster Street (Prince Street) in SoHo.</p>
        <p>That's everything you need to know, and maybe a little more.</p>
        <p>Selling an irrestible mix of what some people deem treasures and others junk, Ms. Eiger, who is 30 years old, embodies the acquiring ethos of her generation. She seizes on items that avid flea-market enthusiasts have gotten in the habit of hunting for: well-worn painted furniture, old toys, birdhouses, cast-iron doorstops, license plates, ($35 each at the shop) and felt banners, ($45 each).</p>
        <p>And it doesn't come particularly cheap. It does, however, require a certain eye, and Ms. Eiger seems to have it. She hopes others will share in what she calls her "vision."</p>
        <p>"You have to have one when you decide to open a store in a recession," she said.</p>
        <p>Here's the vision: "New York City is nobody's hometown," she said. "Everyone is trying to create a little piece of home in their own urban apartment."</p>
        <p>A self-described "hoarder by nature," Ms. Eiger's home happens to be a loft on lower Broadway. A part of the loft now serves as a holding area for items on their way to the store. Or back again.</p>
        <p>"The store is really a facsimile of my house," she explained.</p>
        <p>Tin boxes, green kitchen bowls, whirligigs, tiny Adirondack chairs and dog-shaped cast-iron doorstops that may be in transit to the store contribute to the informal homey look. Most are minus the price tags, of course.</p>
        <p>It helps create an esthetic in which overscale snowshoes, a weathered wheelbarrow and an American flag as a room divider do not seem particularly outrageous. Not exactly "country" in style, the look is more just down-home and lived-in. One might call it "neo-flea" or "well-styled-flea."</p>
        <p>A few things in Ms. Eiger's loft -- the wooden wheel that once steered her grandfather's boat, for example -- are there to stay. Other items, captured on trips upstate and points south and west of Manhattan, are already neatly stickered, bound for the store.</p>
        <p>But nothing leaves without causing Ms. Eiger some angst. "Sometimes it's heart-wrenching for me to give something up," she said. "I feel responsible. I want to feel it's going to a good house. Sometimes I feel sad when someone buys something. I think, 'no one will love it as much as I do.' "</p>
        <p>She's getting better at letting go.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eiger opened the shop a few weeks before Christmas, after working for 10 years as a studio manager in a fashion photography studio and in advertising at Barneys New York.</p>
        <p>"I did this on my own after working for lots of people my whole life," she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eiger, who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., recalled that people thought she was weird because she only liked "things that were old."</p>
        <p>"My Dad was a C.P.A. and a lawyer, my Mom an English teacher, and my grandmother was an interior decorator," she said. Tin boxes were what she collected as a child. Now she has expanded her collecting to include, among other things, cast-iron bookends and vintage cameras.</p>
        <p>Opening the store was like a personal mission, years in the making. "I did everything myself," she said. "I looked for six months for the right location. I choose everything myself. Do you know about Mom and Pop shops? Well, this is a Mom shop."</p>
        <p>Ms. Eiger tends to keep one of everything for herself. In the store, a half dozen roulette wheels, at rest, span one of the freshly painted white walls. At home, a solitary one hangs on the wall. "That's the best one," Ms. Eiger said. "I couldn't part with it."</p>
        <p>The value or age of a particular object is not what particularly appeals to Ms. Eiger. She goes for what she described as "visual appeal."</p>
        <p>"I also like things to be functional," she added, "like tables people have put their feet up on for years," or chairs that look a little the worse -- or, to her eye, the better -- for wear.</p>
        <p>"The 90's are all about staying home and being comfortable," she said. "I like furniture that is not going to get damaged no matter what. It's kidproof and familyproof."</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Eiger does not do restoration, she does do some cleaning of objects. But not repainting. "Everything is as is," she said.</p>
        <p>There are certainly others who share her taste. On a recent visit to the store, people were politely jostling each other. The fact that there are customers at all amazed her parents, who, in spite of their skepticism, have been ardent supporters of her venture. Her mother, Juliette, for example, is Ms. Eiger's traveling companion on buying forays.</p>
        <p>Her father, Leonard, calls it Jenny's World, Ms. Eiger said.</p>
        <p>But on the day she opened the store, Mr. Eiger stopped in early in the morning.</p>
        <p>"Who would ever buy this?" his daughter recalled him saying about a glass jug filled with clay marbles.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Ms. Eiger telephoned her father and said, "Guess what the first thing I sold was?"</p>
        <p>Now that really made her smile.</p>
        <p>Home Town is open Tuesday through Sunday 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. Telephone: (212) 674-5770.</p>
