        <p>The shards date from the mid-1970's, when Ms. Lueders was making reproductions of antique majolica in Italy for export to the United States.

        <p>SOME people collect art. For 15 years, Holly Lueders has hoarded shards.</p>
        <p>The shards date from the mid-1970's, when Ms. Lueders was making reproductions of antique majolica in Italy for export to the United States. In each shipment that arrived in New York, some dishes had been broken. She stuffed the pieces into bags and boxes and carted them along as she moved from apartment to apartment for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>"I thought that one day I might make a mosaic," said Ms. Lueders, who is now primarily a clothing designer.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, she made a mosaic table for herself. "It was a memory table," she said; the shards reflected another part of her career. Her inspiration was the pavements at St. Mark's Basilica in Venice.</p>
        <p>Now she makes tables for others. For a client with a house in East Hampton, L.I., she designed an outdoor table that depicts sea life: a turtle, a scallop shell, a crab, a starfish.</p>
        <p>The table at right is made of blue and white tiles. The center motif is an abstract design of a tasseled pillow. The table, 30 inches in diameter, sells for $1,800. Ms. Lueders can be reached at (212) 246-8150.  CURRENTS</p>
