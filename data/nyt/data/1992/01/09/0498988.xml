        <p>Action for Children's Television, the national watchdog group that promotes quality television programming for children, will disband this year to allow organizations with larger memberships to carry on the cause, the group's president said today.</p>
        <p>The leader, Peggy Charren, said ACT was dissolving because its major goal was achieved last year with Congressional passage of the 1990 Children's Television Act. The group was created in 1968 by three Newton, Mass., housewives.</p>
        <p>"We've done what we set out to do," said Ms. Charren, who was one of the co-founders. "And it's going to take some time to see if it's working. This is something that the local communities should be doing. We don't want laws mandating good programs or censorship. We want the communities to tell broadcasters what's missing."</p>
        <p>The new law places limits on the amount of advertising minutes permitted during children's programs and, for the first time, requires that commercial television stations prove they have "served the educational and information needs of children" in order to have their licenses renewed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Charren said the job of holding broadcasters responsible for conforming to the law would now be carried on by a coalition of groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Parent-Teacher Association, the Center for Science in the Public Interest and its offshoot, the Center for Study of Commercialism.</p>
        <p>She said those groups were preparing to educate people around the country about what broadcasters have to do to comply with the new law.</p>
        <p>With representatives of those organizations present, Ms. Charren made the announcement of ACT's demise at a forum on the future of television, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.</p>
        <p>Although the 1990 law was the group's "shining hour," Ms. Charren said, she also counted among its major victories several Federal rules to ban advertisements of pills, fireworks and, most recently, 900 telephone numbers on children's shows.</p>
        <p>At its peak in the late 1970's, the group employed 15 people and had an annual budget of more than $400,000, she said. In recent years, four people including herself, have worked with a budget of $125,000, she said. Survived by Going Small</p>
        <p>"The way we survived these past years was to get small," she said. "It wasn't money, and it wasn't that I got sick of the issue. Chances are I'll be dealing with and talking about it for all my working life, and I expect to work until I drop dead."</p>
        <p>Supporters and colleagues said that they were sad to see the organization dissolve but that they understood Ms. Charren's reasoning.</p>
        <p>"I think there's reality to her judgment that the National P.T.A., with its large membership, would be more effective to get provisions implemented," said Gerald Lesser, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a co-founder of Children's Television Workshop, the producer of "Sesame Street." "I think ACT brought visibility and attention to the issue of diversity in children's television and put it on the national agenda.</p>
        <p>T. Berry Brazelton, the pediatrician and founder of Parent's Action, a Washington lobbying organization on family issues, said, "I hate to see an important voice like that go down the drain, but Peggy assures me its work will go on."</p>
        <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the effort to enact the Children's Television Act, called Ms. Charren's decision "a severe setback in the fight for quality programming on children's television."</p>
        <p>"Peggy Charren personifies the conscience of America's broadcasting industry," he said. "She has been the little angel that appears on broadcasting's shoulder every time its desire to exploit the commercial potential of children runs amok."</p>
