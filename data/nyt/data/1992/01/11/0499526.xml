        <p>"A year ago my friend and piano teacher Mark Kyrkostas died of AIDS at the age of 38," Teresa Kreuzer of Manhattan said in a letter accompanying her $25 donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "On this rainy day, I remember him by practicing the piano and with this check in the hope that his presence in the world will not be forgotten.</p>
        <p>"Mark lived a generous and loving life," she wrote. "The last words he ever said to me were 'I promise you that I won't die.' I look for ways, this donation among them, to make sure that he never will."</p>

        <p>"A year ago my friend and piano teacher Mark Kyrkostas died of AIDS at the age of 38," Teresa Kreuzer of Manhattan said in a letter accompanying her $25 donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "On this rainy day, I remember him by practicing the piano and with this check in the hope that his presence in the world will not be forgotten.</p>
        <p>"Mark lived a generous and loving life," she wrote. "The last words he ever said to me were 'I promise you that I won't die.' I look for ways, this donation among them, to make sure that he never will."</p>
        <p>Ms. Kreuzer's sentiments are echoed in dozens of letters attached to donations earmarked for people with AIDS. Some are memorials to absent friends; others are sad, angry reflections on the social and psychological toll of H.I.V.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates that one million Americans are infected with the virus that causes AIDS and that by November 130,687 had died of the disease in this country.</p>
        <p>Denise Tredwell of Brewster, N.Y., asked that her $100 be directed to children with AIDS in memory of her son Joshua, who died of a malignant brain tumor last year at 9 1/2 years of age.</p>
        <p>"As terrifying as Joshua's eight-and-a-half-year illness was -- four and a half months on a respirator in New York University's intensive care unit -- I am still even more horrified at the ravages of AIDS," she wrote. "All of its victims touch me deeply, especially those in my own age group.  However, as the mother of two wonderful children, one of whom is now gone, I am sensitive to the plight of children."</p>
        <p>Milton J. Tatelman of Manhattan, who gave $54, wrote that "for the past few years I have enclosed a short note with my donation asking that the contribution help someone enduring the physical and emotional challenge of AIDS. And each year, unfortunately, the needs associated with this devastating disease become greater and scarier."</p>
        <p>He continued: "A simple reminder this holiday season that while donations are always an enormous help, the best gift of all is still the loving support of family and friends.</p>
