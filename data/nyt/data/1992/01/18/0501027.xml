        <p>For at least one brief shining moment, John McEnroe was once again John McEnroe.</p>
        <p>Camelot for the tennis legend came tonight on the Australian Open's center court, where he produced sheer magic to outclass the defending champion, Boris Becker, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, in a third-round match. McEnroe was exuberant over the result; he pumped his fists in the air and grinned proudly as the crowd cheered wildly.</p>
        <p>"Over all, it was a great experience for me," McEnroe said afterward. "It's a big relief. I feel so much lighter. It's been so long since I've beaten a player of Boris's caliber."</p>
        <p>The experts didn't think it was possible anymore. McEnroe is ranked 28th in the world, his lowest ranking since turning professional in 1978, and he has struggled with his game recently, winning only two tournaments in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Was there any way for him to beat Becker, the world's third-ranked player and seeded third in the tournament? Even the 32-year-old McEnroe, once the unconquerable warrior, wasn't sure, although he vowed to give it his best.  Everything Clicks</p>
        <p>In the end, McEnroe gave it more than his best. Against Becker, he did everything right. His serves and volleys were exquisite. His service returns were brilliant. His shot-making was perfect. He went for the lines and the lines seemed to reach up and grab every ball he sent their way.</p>
        <p>McEnroe had not played tennis with such focus and concentration since his heyday. The last time he remembered being so purposeful was in 1984, when he won Wimbledon and the United States Open as the No. 1 player in the world for the fourth year running.</p>
        <p>Tonight's match was in stark contrast with his last visit to Melbourne, in the 1990 Australian Open. In that tournament, he was ejected in the round of 16 for abusive behavior.</p>
        <p>Attitude, however, was definitely not a problem for McEnroe tonight. McEnroe was the model of propriety.</p>
        <p>"My father always told me if I didn't question calls and concentrated on my tennis, I'd be a better player and I probably would have been," said McEnroe. "But I didn't."</p>
        <p>Becker's performance resembled his loss last July to Michael Stich at Wimbledon. The 24-year-old German was sluggish and experienced problems with his right hamstring; a similar problem hampered his play at Wimbledon. Midway through tonight's match, he put on Lycra exercise shorts to keep his legs warm in the biting chill.</p>
        <p>Basically though, McEnroe aggressively challenged him at every juncture and Becker had no answers. "Took Me By Surprise</p>
        <p>"I was surprised he played three sets for two and a half hours at a level so high," said Becker, who because of this early-round loss will drop several notches in the ranking. "He didn't play at that level at our last meetings. It took me by surprise."</p>
        <p>Becker, who hasn't slid below No. 5 in the rankings since June 20, 1988, when he held the No. 8 slot, seemed shellshocked by McEnroe's performance. He had beaten McEnroe the last six times they had met and lost to him only once, in 1985.</p>
        <p>McEnroe said he thought that Becker couldnot believe what was unfolding.</p>
        <p>"I surprised him and he made some mistakes he shouldn't have made," said McEnroe, who will meet 13th-seeded Emilio Sanchez in the fourth round. "He seemed surprised about me. I knew he knew he was in a tough match. I could see he was getting frustrated."  Cool Night, Packed Crowd</p>
        <p>Despite the cool air, the Flinders Park Stadium was packed with about 15,000 spectators sitting any place they could find.  About the only one who was hot was McEnroe. Even when things weren't exactly going his way, he confidently plotted his course.</p>
        <p>"I played great, there's no question about it," McEnroe said, smiling. "I did what I wanted to do. I did what I wanted to do to beat Boris. He acted like he didn't believe I could keep doing what I was doing."</p>
        <p>With McEnroe leading, 6-4, 4-1, Becker finally acted as if his wake-up call had arrived. He blasted three aces in a row in the first three points of the sixth game of the second set and then broke McEnroe's service in the next game. But Becker made a critical error on McEnroe's third break point in the eighth game: he took his eyes off the ball and totally mistimed a shot that ended up like a pop-up. That made it 5-3 for McEnroe and he took the second set with an ace on his fifth set point in the ninth game.</p>
        <p>Things weren't easy for McEnroe in the third set and it could have gone either way. McEnroe jumped to an early 2-1 lead, but Becker immediately broke back. McEnroe failed to capitalize on three break points in the ninth game. But in the 11th game of the set, McEnroe got his break when Becker made two backhand errors in a row. Up 6-5, McEnroe then served out the match in the next game.</p>
        <p>Becker was asked later whether McEnroe could win the Open. "Well, he's beaten the guy who won it last year," he answered. The Other McEnroe Loses</p>
        <p>McEnroe's younger brother, Patrick, didn't fare as well in his third-round match earlier in the day. A semifinalist here last year, Patrick McEnroe suffered a tough five-set loss to Andrei Chesnokov, who won by 6-4, 1-6, 1-6, 6-1, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Also today, Ivan Lendl, seeded fifth, overcame the service blasts of Markus Zoecke of Germany to win, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6). David Wheaton, seeded 15th and the winner of $2 million at the Grand Slam Cup last month, cruised past Lars Koslowski, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, top-seeded Stefan Edberg and Monica Seles won easily.  TENNIS</p>
