        <p>Americans buy much more from the Japanese than the Japanese buy from the U.S. Everybody knows that these huge trade deficits force Americans out of work. That's why President Bush is leading an entourage of big-shot executives to pressure the Japanese to import more goods and thereby create "jobs, jobs, jobs."</p>
        <p>But what everybody knows just isn't true. Trade deficits don't cause unemployment; indeed, the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit. If that statement seems to contradict common sense, just recall the 1980's, when the U.S. rang up $100 billion trade deficits yet operated near full employment. Bashing Japan might make good campaign rhetoric, but it's unlikely to lower the unemployment rate one tick.</p>

        <p>Americans buy much more from the Japanese than the Japanese buy from the U.S. Everybody knows that these huge trade deficits force Americans out of work. That's why President Bush is leading an entourage of big-shot executives to pressure the Japanese to import more goods and thereby create "jobs, jobs, jobs."</p>
        <p>But what everybody knows just isn't true. Trade deficits don't cause unemployment; indeed, the number of employed Americans is unrelated to the size of the trade deficit. If that statement seems to contradict common sense, just recall the 1980's, when the U.S. rang up $100 billion trade deficits yet operated near full employment. Bashing Japan might make good campaign rhetoric, but it's unlikely to lower the unemployment rate one tick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's promise to create jobs is based on the false premise that generating exports or cutting imports is an effective way to create demand for U.S. workers during the current recession. But the U.S. doesn't need the Japanese to create demand: the same economic kick could be delivered if the Federal Reserve Board were to further lower interest rates or Congress were to reduce taxes and raise Government spending.</p>
        <p>Indeed, trying to create jobs by manipulating the trade deficit would be absurdly difficult, requiring the restructure of Japanese society before the recession runs its course in the next couple of months.</p>
        <p>Besides timing, the attempt to drive down the trade deficit would likely be self-defeating. If Americans were to buy fewer Japanese cars -- which would, in turn, require selling fewer dollars to buy yen -- the value of the dollar would rise. That would make U.S. exports more expensive, cutting sales. Employment in Detroit auto factories would rise.  But employment in the airplane, agriculture and computer software industries would plummet by comparable amounts. Mr. Bush wouldn't be creating jobs, he'd be swapping jobs between Detroit and Iowa.</p>
        <p>There is a constructive spin Mr. Bush could put on his Asian mission, but it wouldn't pack much wallop. By blocking imports, Japan prevents its trading partners from selling what they make best.  That forces them to produce more of what they make less well, lowering their living standards a bit. The biggest losers, however, are Japanese consumers -- who, for example, pay astoundingly high prices for domestically grown rice that can be produced far more cheaply by the United States.</p>
        <p>So while Mr. Bush can't accurately promise that knocking down Japanese trade barriers will produce more jobs, he could rightly promise that it would raise U.S. living standards a tad. That's not an exciting message, but at least it's honest.</p>
        <p>The unpleasant truth is that U.S. trade deficits are home-grown. They occur because Americans overconsume -- buying more goods than they produce. The excess consumption comes from foreign suppliers -- if not from Japan, then from Korea, Germany or Canada. As long as Americans persist in outspending their income, cutting the trade deficit with Japan to zero would solve nothing.</p>
        <p>There is a serious consequence of insufficient saving, but it's not the trade deficit. A country that saves too little invariably invests too little in new machinery and technology. Over time that means slow productivity growth and stagnant incomes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush chose the wrong problem and offered the wrong solution. The trade deficit isn't related to the number, or productivity, of American jobs.</p>
