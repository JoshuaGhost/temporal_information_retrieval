        <p>CHAMBER OPERA</p>
        <p>Tiny Operas," three short chamber operas adapted by Susan O. Bingham from stories by O. Henry, will be presented by the Chancel Opera Company of Connecticut today at 4 and 7:30 P.M. in Christ Church, 84 Broadway, New Haven.</p>
        <p>"The Gift of the Magi," "The Last Leaf" and "Makes the Whole World Kin," were first presented as "Tiny Operas" in 1987 at Lincoln Center by the After Dinner Opera Company of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Featured in today's performances are Judith Caldwell and Barbara Yeichner, sopranos; Kyle Pruett, tenor, and Timothy Bingham, baritone. "Daniel's Gift," a children's opera based on the book by M. C. Helldorfer, is also on the program.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bingham has composed several works for her company, mostly liturgical in nature. "Old Befana," an opera about the Italian Christmas figure, was performed at Christ Church in January of last year, and "The Goose Girl" had its premiere last spring at the Worthington-Hooker School. "The Wild Swans" was presented at Sprague Hall on the Yale campus in 1988, and at the Annual Kodaly Convention in Boston in 1989.</p>
        <p>Admission is $10 and a can of soup. Proceeds will benefit the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen. SIGN LAQNGUAGE</p>
        <p>Sign language is enlarging its sphere as a means of communication, no longer solely for deaf people. Its use among hostages in the Middle East is an example.</p>
        <p>The National Theater of the Deaf in Chester has been in the forefront of the movement designed to bring hearing-impaired people into the mainstream through the universal language of drama and through workshops worldwide. Now it is offering courses in sign language for everyone, starting tomorrow with Beginning Sign Language. Conversational Sign Language I begins Tuesday, Conversational Sign Language II starts Wednesday. All classes will be held at the National Theater of the Deaf, 5 West Main Street, from 7 to 9 P.M. for six weeks. The fee for each class is $50. For more information or to register, call 526-4971 for normal voice communication or 526-4974 if hearing impaired. COPLAND BIOGRAPHY</p>
        <p>Vivian Perlis, music historian at Yale and collaborator with Aaron Copland on a two-volume biography of the composer, will talk about him and his work during a concert of his music Saturday in Simsbury.</p>
        <p>The books, titled "Copland: 1900 Through 1942" and "Copland: Since 1943" are considered to be the definitive works documenting his life and career as writer, lecturer, and conductor as well as a composer whose music bore a distinctively American flavor.</p>
        <p>The concert by the World Chamber Ensemble begins at 8 P.M. in the Centennial Theater of Westminster School, 995 Hopmeadow Street (Route 10). The program consists of the "Quartet in One Movement," "Sonata for Violin and Piano," "Sextet for String Quartet, Piano and Clarinet," "Poems of Emily Dickinson" for voice and piano, and "Vitebsk Trio."</p>
        <p>The performers are Anhared Stowe and Martha Kayser, violinists; Carol Burke, violist; Eric Dahlin, cellist; Ronald M. Krentzman, clarinetist, and Joanne Scattergood, soprano. A reception will follow the performance.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $14, students $7, and children free. Call 658-7909 for reservations. ARTISANS' WORK</p>
        <p>Today from 1 to 5 P.M. marks the final day of an exhibition of decorative and utilitarian objects made in Connecticut by its best craftsmen over the centuries. Selected from the permanent collection at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London where it is on display, the pieces include fine examples of chairs and chests made in Norwich and Colchester. One of them is the so-called Sunflower Chest made by Peter Blin in 1680.</p>
        <p>Paintings include 18th-century portraits of Major and Mrs. Ruben Hatch, and landscapes by Hudson River artists and American Impressionists. Among them are works by Edmond Greacen, J. Alden Weir, Edward Potthast, Willard Metcalf and Guy Wiggins.</p>
        <p>Illustration of a different sort, done by young women with needle and thread, is also on view in a collection of embroidered scenes of domestic life. Framed and hung on the walls of countless 18th- and 19th-century living rooms, they were affirmations of family sentiment.</p>
        <p>In the decorative arts, there is a tall clock case by Erastus Tracy, dated 1792, and silver for which New London was famous as a production center. John Gardner and J. Proctor Trott were among the makers of expertly crafted silver porringers, spoons, ladels, beakers, creamers and tankards. In addition, there are pewter teapots, plates and pitchers, some by Joseph Belcher, Jr. The museum is at 625 Williams Street in New London, admission is free but a donation of $3 is suggested. Call 443-2545 for more information. SILVERMINE GUILD</p>
        <p>Twice a year the Silvermine Guild of Artists elects new members on the basis of pieces submitted for evaluation by a jury of member artists. An exhibition of the work of its newly elected colleagues opens today with a reception from 2 to 4 P.M. The show will continue through Jan. 26 at the Silvermine Galleries, 1037 Silvermine Road, New Canaan.</p>
        <p>Painters from Connecticut include Frank Bruckman, H. Kathryn Frund, Dave Anthony Burke and Bruce Van Valen, and Jakki Kouffman and Sharon Opsahl Wandel from New York State. Also in the show is the work of the Connecticut photographers Sara S. Augenbraun, Lee Paine and Jan Murdock, as well as the New Yorker Rochelle Rauchberg. The sculptors June Ahrens and Susan Tamar Greenberg, and the ceramicists Ilene Mahler and Sandra Graf are all from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The gallery is open free of charge Tuesday through Saturday from 11 to 5 and Sunday from noon to 5. Call 966-5617 for more information. OIL SPILLS</p>
        <p>Teachers and other adults who have an interest in the biological and technological aspects of oil spills may sign up for a two-part class and workshop on the subject at the Thames Science Center in New London.</p>
        <p>"Sleuthing Out Oil Spills" is the title of the first session, to be held Wednesday from 3 to 5 P.M. at the center's headquarters on Gallows Lane. Participants will separate and identify the components of oil by means of chromatography, then examine the properties of oil through a computer program developed at the center, learning how to create similar programs for themselves.</p>
        <p>The second session, scheduled for Jan, 22 at the same hours, is called "Industrious Microbes." It focuses on the manner in which bacteria devour oil, breaking down its components. How to grow bacteria by feeding them oil will be explored, and everyone will receive a take-home sample of oil-degrading bacteria with which to experiment or devise study projects.</p>
        <p>The cost of the first session is $30, the second is $40. To register or obtain more information call 442-0391.</p>
