        <p>THE six-week-old North Street Grill in Great Neck is the Island's hottest new restaurant. It has the look, ownership expertise and exciting menu that make it the last word in 1990's dining.</p>
        <p>The multi-level restaurant that has emerged on the site of the old Maude Craig's is a stunner. It is earthy, sturdy and southwestern, yet light, airy and modern.</p>
        <p>Imposing stained-glass light fixtures typify this fusion. They glow with a blend of Art Deco and American Indian geometric designs. The dining room is dominated by them, along with the high ceilings, wood timbers, skylights and a bustling open kitchen.</p>
        <p>The culinary superstar behind this new enterprise is Brendan Walsh, who earned his chef stripes at Arizona 206 in Manhattan and Coyote Grill in Island Park. Mr. Walsh is part owner of North Street Grill and oversees its kitchen, as well as the one at Coyote Grill.</p>
        <p>The menu hints at Mr. Walsh's Southwestern style, with a salsa here and a chili-spiked hollandaise there, but the offerings are a far cry from straight Santa Fe fare. The food is up-to-the-minute American with an overlay of Italian trendsetters like focaccia, polenta, wood-oven pizza and innovative pastas.</p>
        <p>All is not perfection at this storybook-sounding restaurant, although it should be noted that it is only a few weeks old. Service is shaky and some dishes are disappointments.</p>
        <p>On a busy Saturday night, service was a study in smiling neglect. Our waiter was amiable, but we were left to pour our own wine. We also failed to receive bread. That was unfortunate, because the chewy focaccia strewn with onions and peppers, and the crusty country-style bread, both baked in the restaurant's wood oven, are too good to miss.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the young people who delivered the meal were fuzzy about who ordered what and plunked dishes down at random. Even on a slower weeknight, when service was attentive, there was still a breakdown at delivery time.</p>
        <p>Shortfalls from the kitchen included a watery pasta of penette with red beans and white-clam sauce. The dish arrived with no beans, no taste and no apologies. Less of a strikeout but garnering no accolades was the rib eye steak, which turned out to be a chewy shell steak look-alike.</p>
        <p>These losers are not typical of North Street Grill. There is a nightly parade of winners, beginning with the herb- and garlic-flavored olives and the bouquet of two-foot-long crunchy breadsticks.</p>
        <p>Do not miss the individual appetizer pizzas, with their crisp crusts pleasantly charred from the wood oven. My favorite had grilled eggplant, roasted peppers and a fillip of garlicky aioli.</p>
        <p>Alluring seafood openers are house-smoked salmon, shrimp and sesame fritters paired with a creamy wasabi mustard and sea scallops skewered with a ribbon of pancetta and presented over crisp slices of marinated kohlrabi.</p>
        <p>Three salads made fine beginings. A fall-away tender confit of duck accompanied by greens and a paper-thin homemade potato chip fan is the menu's most expensive appetizer at $9.50. More economical is the $4.50 market salad of impeccably fresh greens in a light balsamic vinaigrette. Also winning kudos was the wilted salad of julienned strips of endive crowned with walnuts and goat cheese.</p>
        <p>A main-course choice with salad at its heart is lovely baby greens encircled with grilled vegetables. A splash of herb-infused olive oil was its delicious complement.</p>
        <p>Fish fanciers will reel in a keeper with either the crusty pan-seared salmon resting on a bed of lentils or the wood oven-roasted channel bass ringed with ratatouille and annointed with black olive paste.</p>
        <p>At the top of the list for meat lovers is a house-made chicken chorizo sausage served with white beans and bitter greens. A half chicken rubbed with herbs and perched atop a bread salad consisting of greens, toasted croutons and dried cranberries also scored.</p>
        <p>Beef tenderloin, unlike the rib eye steak, was tender perfection. It was enhanced by a tomato-chili hollandaise and a nest of chopped asparagus.</p>
        <p>Every entree has its own well-matched vegetable accompaniments. Nevertheless, there are $4 a la carte side dishes. The best is the array of crunchy baby vegetables. Potato pancakes were soggy, and sweet potato home fries were thick slices slathered with sauteed onions and peppers that did not fit the menu description.</p>
        <p>Only an apple cobbler disappointed at dessert. Served piping hot rather than warm, its scoop of maple ice cream became an instant puddle. Ice creams are homemade, and the best is the fresh mint with its intense herb flavor.</p>
        <p>Chocolate lovers swooned over a moist cupcake encircled with dollops of creamy chocolate pudding, as well as a rich slab of frozen chocolate mousse cake that melted on the tongue.</p>
        <p>Wine and food are given equal billing at North Street Grill. More than 100 mostly American wines are available by the bottle, and 10 more can be ordered by the glass. Although a smattering of Italian, French and Long Island wines are on the list, its focus is on the small, high-quality, boutique wines of the West Coast.</p>
        <p>Names seen only rarely on East Coast lists abound at North Street. They include Chappelet, Edna Valley, Chalk Hill, Arrowood, Dalla Valle, Page Mill and Frog's Leap. Wine can be ordered for as little as $15 a bottle and $3.75 a glass. North Street Grill</p>
