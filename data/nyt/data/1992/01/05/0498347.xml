        <p>After a banner year, when the average stock fund rose 30.7 percent, mutual fund investors may wonder where to go from here.</p>
        <p>The outlook is not so bright for 1992. Most experts predict a less-than-robust economic recovery that slows investment returns to just 10 percent or so.</p>
        <p>Three fund investment advisers, asked to craft model portfolios for 1992, all included a mix of small-company and growth stock funds; two added a smattering of bond funds.</p>
        <p>Here is what the advisers have to say.</p>
        <p>Kenneth E. Gregory, principal in the San Francisco-based money management firm Litman/Gregory, believes that small-capitalization stocks, the biggest winners in 1991, will keep their lead this year. Small companies usually perform better than big concerns during economic recoveries, as they have the potential of growing faster. Not incidentally, they are beginning to regain favor with institutional investors. Strong earnings growth is worth a big premium in a stagnating economy, and today's premium is low by historic standards, he says.</p>
        <p>He would put 70 percent of his portfolio into stocks, split between United States and international stock funds. Most of the domestic holdings would be in two small-company funds: Brandywine, an aggressive play, and Monetta, a more conservative fund that holds small and medium-size companies.</p>
        <p>The rest of the United States stock-fund component is split between IAI Stock, a conservative growth fund with larger capitalization stocks, and Gabelli Asset, a growth fund.</p>
        <p>On the international side, Mr. Gregory likes Harbor International, which invests overseas but downplays Japanese and German issues. And because interest rates are still falling, rewarding bondholders with capital gains, he would put 30 percent of the portfolio into the Pimit Total Return fund.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory believes the market may drop in the first half of the year; after the decline, he would shift the allocation, moving half of the money in Pimit into stock funds, so that the portfolio would then have an 85 percent stake in stocks and 15 percent in bonds.</p>
        <p>The Pimit fund is also a favorite of Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo. Mr. Ogorek says that while short-term interest rates have fallen dramatically, long-term rates have not hit bottom yet. He would put 20 percent of his portfolio into Pimit, which holds a mix of corporate and government bonds and is yielding about 7.7 percent, because "it's a diversified, conservative fund that doesn't bet the farm on one interest rate projection," he said.</p>
        <p>A far riskier choice for investors who want to play falling long-term interest rates this year is Benham Target 2000, which holds zero-coupon bonds.</p>
        <p>Historically, when small stocks outperform the overall market, their run has lasted eight to 14 years, Mr. Ogorek says. So he expects last year's small-cap revival to stay in place for several years, though he cautions investors not to expect the same outstanding returns that they got in 1991, when the small-stock group returned an average of 51.6 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
        <p>He would allocate 20 percent of his portfolio to a small-stock fund, namely Twentieth Century Ultra, a top-performing but volatile fund that has outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock average by an average of 8 percentage points annually for the past five years. For investors looking for a more cautious small-company play, he likes Sit New Beginning Growth.</p>
        <p>He would split the balance of his investment in United States stocks between Selected American Shares, a growth-and-income fund, (30 percent) and Financial Strategic Health Sciences, which invests in health maintenance organizations, discount mail-order pharmacies and similar cost-cutting health-care plays (10 percent).</p>
        <p>The final 20 percent would be invested in Harbor International, the foreign stock fund.</p>
        <p>Kurt Brouwer, partner in Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, an investment advisory firm in San Francisco, would put 32 percent of a conservative growth portfolio into small-company stock funds. Among his picks are Pennsylvania Mutual, a "value" fund whose managers look for stocks that are cheap relative to the company's probable worth. (Growth managers, who look for earnings that are expected to outpace the average, were among the big winners in 1991.) Another pick: GIT Equity Special Growth Portfolio, which invests mainly in very small companies with market capitalizations of $150 million or so.</p>
        <p>Another 48 percent of the portfolio would go to large-capitalization stock funds, divided between the Janus Fund, a conservative fund with a growth orientation, and Gabelli Asset Fund, which takes a value approach to investing.</p>
        <p>He also likes Warburg Pincus Counsellors Capital Appreciation, a growth fund that invests in a mix of small- and large-cap stocks.</p>
        <p>The remainder of the portfolio would go to the international play, and he would invest in, yes, Harbor International, a value-oriented stock fund.</p>
