        <p>The stock market has lurched into overdrive, betting that the Federal Reserve's shift to low interest rates means that an economic rebound is just months away. But unlike the speculators who face perhaps 50-50 odds, President Bush in his State of the Union Address tomorrow is expected to make a wager that arguably has a 100 percent chance of being wrong.</p>
        <p>Recession year "borrow and stimulate" packages have a habit of missing the present and haunting the future. And in the present circumstances, the case against the grab bag of stimulants for housing, investment and the middle-class consumer that the President is expected to announce is especially compelling.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, if Mr. Bush had not been so reluctant to raise taxes early in his term when the economy was healthy, his current risky prescription would not be necessary. But when he finally moved his lips in November 1990, he wound up imposing a major tax increase just as the bottom was dropping out of the economy. Ironically, the right-wingers who thwarted him then now compound their felony by loudly pressing for unadulterated pump priming.</p>
        <p>If Wall Street is correct, however, and we are at the turning point of an ordinary business cycle, the Federal Reserve's 4 percent money market rates will spark business activity long before the House Ways and Means Committee even takes roll call.</p>
        <p>Arousing Congress from its usual stupor in order to ignite the fiscal afterburners would thus be doubly tragic. By eliciting a Capitol Hill bidding war to include a stimulant for every constituency with a name, the Administration will not only expand the short-term deficit but also risk squandering the prospective post-cold war fiscal windfall.</p>
        <p>After all, financing national security during the cold war took more than 6 percent of the gross national product. Surely in this new era of ruble rubble, defense can eventually be financed on just 3 percent of G.N.P.</p>
        <p>Thus, a normal recovery could mean a strong revenue rebound, a reversal of the $100 billion-a-year savings and loan bailout and a decent chance to harvest the peace dividend. What could ruin this golden opportunity to rid the nation of the curse of mega-deficits, however, is the fiscal stampede the Administration is about to launch.</p>
        <p>There remains the more likely prospect that instead of a downturn in the ordinary business cycle, we are in the middle of national balance sheet shock. In the 1980's we raised the collective debt of the economy from $4 billion to $11 billion -- and its percentage of G.N.P. rose to an unprecedented 200 percent.</p>
        <p>Could the drop in nominal growth indicators like housing prices, lending, spending and wages to anemic 2 to 4 percent rates -- levels not seen since the 1950's -- mean that a genuine debt deflation is under way? If so, hitting the fiscal accelerator after the Federal Reserve has launched its high-octane money policy could prove highly hazardous.</p>
        <p>Why? Because economic recovery may turn on restoring financial confidence, not consumer spending.</p>
        <p>Our balance sheet problem involves not just an excess of debt, but, more important, a surfeit of assets. The debt side of the balance sheet, however ugly and distended, is backward-looking -- a measure of recklessness during the 1980's. Likewise, the mushrooming defaults weigh more heavily on current wealth than on future production.</p>
        <p>It is the abundance of household and business fixed assets that really threaten recovery. Cars, VCR's, wardrobes, office buildings, hotel rooms, airplanes and retail floor space, overbought in yesterday's debt spree, must now inevitably become oversold and underproduced. The former brings a markdown in value and confidence, the latter an extended hiatus in business activity and employment.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the public's flaccid shopping behavior represents as much an exhaustion of need as it does anxiety about the value of its principal collateral and the flow of income needed to service its debts.</p>
        <p>On the business side, banks, brokerage houses, insurance and real estate companies acquired personal computers, modular furniture and square footage like there was no tomorrow. This sector, with a base of only 17 percent of real G.N.P. in 1980, accounted for an astounding $450 billion or 50 percent of the real growth in the nation's capital stock through 1989. Could the lack of orders at I.B.M., Compaq and the office furniture makers signal an overabundance of fixed assets and a long, flat spell ahead?</p>
        <p>If we are in balance sheet shock that holds down business expansion until the fixed-asset surplus can be marked down and slowly absorbed, the financial markets will likely soon go into cardiac arrest. Confidence will ebb to the vanishing point. In this case, a renewed exercise in fiscal pump priming that would send the Federal deficit soaring toward half a trillion dollars will have many effects. Stimulating an economic recovery will not be among them.</p>
