        <p>Waterproof eyeliner must have been invented for performers like Ozzy Osbourne, who regularly punctuated his concert on Friday night at the Paramount by dipping his head in a bucket of water, then flinging the contents into the front rows. Mr. Osbourne is rock's most cheerful ghoul, singing about strange compulsions, unholy desires, mass destruction and Judgment Day. His concerts, however, are like pep rallies, where Mr. Osbourne urges his fans to sing along and "go crazy." At the Paramount the audience, overwhelmingly male and mostly wearing black T-shirts, stayed on its feet throughout the set; "I love you all!" Mr. Osbourne kept shouting.</p>
        <p>As the singer for Black Sabbath in the 1970's and on his own during the 1980's, Mr. Osbourne laid the foundation for speed-metal with songs that bash and pummel heavy-metal riffs while lyrics ponder the pervasiveness of evil, sometimes from the perspective of a killer or a lost soul. He has a gift for writing ambiguous lyrics; in "No More Tears," the title song of his current album (Epic), it's hard to tell whether the woman he's singing about is alive or dead.</p>

        <p>Waterproof eyeliner must have been invented for performers like Ozzy Osbourne, who regularly punctuated his concert on Friday night at the Paramount by dipping his head in a bucket of water, then flinging the contents into the front rows. Mr. Osbourne is rock's most cheerful ghoul, singing about strange compulsions, unholy desires, mass destruction and Judgment Day.

At the Paramount the audience, overwhelmingly male and mostly wearing black T-shirts, stayed on its feet throughout the set; "I love you all!" Mr. Osbourne kept shouting.</p>
        <p>As the singer for Black Sabbath in the 1970's and on his own during the 1980's, Mr. Osbourne laid the foundation for speed-metal with songs that bash and pummel heavy-metal riffs while lyrics ponder the pervasiveness of evil, sometimes from the perspective of a killer or a lost soul. He has a gift for writing ambiguous lyrics; in "No More Tears," the title song of his current album (Epic), it's hard to tell whether the woman he's singing about is alive or dead.</p>
        <p>The promise of blasphemy and forbidden messages have been lucrative for Mr. Osbourne, who has been a regular target for antirock crusades by the religious right. While his songs and album covers toy with Satanist imagery and belittle organized religion, he actually doesn't proselytize for anything beyond self-reliance: "Don't look at me for answers," he howls in "I Don't Know."</p>
        <p>Mr. Osbourne's songs are fairly tuneful compared with current speed-metal. His band can easily pound out bone-rattling riffs, with a guitarist, Zakk Wylde, who plays trills and fast scales and squealing sustained notes with all the histrionics he can muster. But the songs also make room for slower interludes that echo the Beatles, and now and then Mr. Osbourne sings a ballad about an ending or a burgeoning romance. His followers have dispensed with such pop elements.</p>
        <p>Performing at a midsize theater rather than his usual arenas, Mr. Osbourne used video screens instead of a stage set, sometimes showing images related to the lyrics: Aleister Crowley's signature, for instance, during the elegiac "Mr. Crowley." A five-minute introductory clip showed Mr. Osbourne making scary faces and wearing fangs amid headlines about "the devil's music" and his song "Suicide Solution," which is about slow death by drinking.</p>
        <p>For all the songs' vows of anarchy, Mr. Osbourne's show stuck with heavy-metal protocol, alternating groups of songs with unaccompanied solos by band members, as Mr. Osbourne yelled the same exhortations he was using on his 1982 album, "Speak of the Devil" (Jet/CBS). Taped keyboard interludes were occasionally added to songs, and on "I Don't Want to Change the World" Mr. Osbourne and Mr. Wylde were apparently lip-synching the harmonies of the chorus.</p>
        <p>Now and then an audience member would clamber on stage, embrace Mr. Osbourne or a band member and then be pulled into the wings -- until the finale, when half a dozen audience members surrounded Mr. Osbourne and stayed onstage during his bows. "That's the way I like it!" Mr. Osbourne shouted, though he didn't like it enough to play another encore.</p>
