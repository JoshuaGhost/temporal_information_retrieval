        <p>EIGHT years ago Standish House in Wethersfield first opened as a restaurant. The town-owned house was sublet to the proprietors, Gian and Valerie Marchesan, by the Wethersfield Historical Society. The town is a real tourist magnet, full of vintage historic houses to visit, and visitors need an attractive place to dine after sightseeing forays. Until Standish House opened, the town had no such place.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Standish House fills the bill beautifully. The center-hall, double-chimney clapboard house in Georgian and Federal style dates to 1787. The two dining rooms, to the left and right of the center hall, look much as they may have in their 18th-century prime, each with a fireplace, graceful chandelier, Chippendale and Queen Anne chairs and inside shutters.</p>

        <p>EIGHT years ago Standish House in Wethersfield first opened as a restaurant. The town-owned house was sublet to the proprietors, Gian and Valerie Marchesan, by the Wethersfield Historical Society. The town is a real tourist magnet, full of vintage historic houses to visit, and visitors need an attractive place to dine after sightseeing forays. Until Standish House opened, the town had no such place.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Standish House fills the bill beautifully. The center-hall, double-chimney clapboard house in Georgian and Federal style dates to 1787. The two dining rooms, to the left and right of the center hall, look much as they may have in their 18th-century prime, each with a fireplace, graceful chandelier, Chippendale and Queen Anne chairs and inside shutters.</p>
        <p>While Standish House is old, its menu is not. The chef has changed since we first reviewed the restaurant in 1984, but the food still follows the path of New American cooking, with a French accent in the cooking techniques and a healthy emphasis on regional ingredients. Rack of lamb, New York pepper steak, and breast of duck all fit the locale and climate perfectly.</p>
        <p>The imaginative use of accouterments gives a sparkle to the tried and true. For instance, the breast of duck (which also included a generous portion of leg and thigh, beautifully browned, crisp skinned and piping hot) was adorned with slices of fresh pear and a delicate Poire William sauce, accompanied by a mixture of rice and wild rice. As with the other entrees, the plate also contained baked zucchini stuffed with diced fresh vegetables. The aromatic medium-rare rack of lamb also contained a contemporary surprise: a side dish of Hollandaise spiked with garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Unusual, yes, but it added a dollop of pizazz to the lamb. New York pepper steak in a balsamic vinegar and shallot sauce was also refreshing.</p>
        <p>Among the best entrees were crunchily crusted chicken breast in a chive sauce with a generous mound of herbed goat cheese on top, and peppery Cajun swordfish brushed with crabmeat butter. Less successful were the too-chewy veal medallions with prosciutto, in a Cheddar cheese-applejack sauce that overpowered the veal.</p>
        <p>While there were several worthy appetizers, two of the three salads made refreshing starters in themselves (especially after a welcoming plate of country pate and cheese-topped toast rounds served on our arrival). Tops was the endive salad, with an abundance of crisp Belgian endive spears, mixed with pear slivers, curls of prosciutto, chopped walnuts and Stilton cheese lightly dressed with walnut oil and raspberry vinaigrette. The flavors and texture contrasts were superb.</p>
        <p>A welcome alternative was a tasty spinach salad, rife with bits of apple, bacon and crumbled blue cheese in a cider vinegar-olive oil dressing. The house salad consisted of three kinds of greens, but the mustard vinaigrette was a tad too timid.</p>
        <p>Consider also the smoothly pureed sweet potato and sausage soup, with bits of Italian sweet sausage added for extra verve. The starter standout was feuillette of wild mushrooms -- the crisp puff pastry overflowing with cepes in a sensuously rich and velvety Madeira cream. Smoked turkey slices were enhanced by a tart, chopped, uncooked cranberry relish, less so by the somewhat unnecessary applesauce. Our only appetizer disappointment was carpaccio of beef tenderloin. Although the scoop of celery root salad served with it was a lively addition, the miserly pieces of beef were too few and sliced too thick.</p>
        <p>Like almost everything on the menu, except the excellent crusty French bread, desserts are prepared on the premises. The premiere choice was chocolate raspberry mousse cake (on a sponge cake base), resting in a pool of intense fresh raspberry puree. Other than that, linzertorte had a rich and nutty crust but the pumpkin-Bourbon cheesecake was surprisingly nondescript. A whole poached pear looked appealing, but its macaroon stuffing was soggy and tasteless. The two sauces (Zinfandel and creme Anglaise) with the pear flowed together in a thin, undefinable morass.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner for two cost $50 before tax, tip and beverages. There is a moderate-sized wine list, nicely priced, mostly American and French, but four vintages we ordered were out of stock. Apparently Standish House has not just survived but thrived. The addition to historic Wethersfield is a valued asset. Standish House</p>
