        <p>The city's Department of Transportation plans to begin major repairs to the deteriorating Manhattan Bridge this spring.</p>
        <p>The reconstruction of the 83-year-old bridge is the first of 17 bridge construction projects for which contracts will be awarded by April 15, said Joseph DePlasco, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, there will be inconveniences and we would prefer to orchestrate the rehabilitation, one bridge at a time," Mr. DePlasco said. "But the problems have been deferred and we're in the unfortunate position of having to repair all the bridges at the same time."</p>
        <p>The rapairs will involve the entire southern side of the bridge and is the second phase of the rehabilitation project begun in 1985. Work on the approaches and side span of the northern side of the bridge were completed in 1988. The work will also involve the repair of the long-closed pedestrian walkway.</p>
        <p>City officials said on Friday that Yonkers Contracting Company, which has a number of state contracts, has submitted a bid of $97 million, the lowest of three bids for the Manhattan Bridge contract. The Yonkers company is being sued by Attorney General Robert Abrams for reportedly rigging bids.</p>
        <p>Mr. DePlasco said the department would review the contract from the engineering prospective "to insure there are no irregularities." The city would also make background checks, he said.</p>
