        <p>How to Create a Cuisine</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the qualities necessary for the creation of a uniquely American cuisine, the writer and gourmet ("buongustaio") Angelo Pellegrini suggests that the crucial element is our attitude toward life. This is from "Vintage Pellegrini: The Collected Wisdom of an American Buongustaio," edited by Schuyler Ingle (Sasquatch Books).</p>
        <p>The American, lacking the spur of necessity and engrossed in the exploitation of resources with which no other nation has been blessed in anything like the same degree, has been understandably satisfied to feed on plain meat and potatoes. His curiosity about culinary matters, of relatively recent origin, is an encouraging sign. If he would proceed wisely, however, he must remember that the evolution of a traditional cuisine requires time. His immediate concern should be a willingness to experiment, an insistence upon quality, a purging of his mind of all culinary prejudice, and the development of a humane attitude toward the dinner hour. These, and not a slavish imitation of foreign recipes and esoteric menus, are the bases upon which a sound American cuisine may be eventually developed. The Writer as Worker</p>
        <p>Our image of writing as a magical act obscures the reality of the hard work that writers do and the true nature of a writer's life, according to the novelist Valerie Miner. This is from "Rumors From the Cauldron: Selected Essays, Reviews and Reportage" (University of Michigan, paper).</p>
        <p>Tensions arise between audience and author when we confuse the writing with the writer herself. Most Americans romanticize art as magic. We perceive literature as the result of "creativity" rather than "creative labor," forgetting that writers are workers. We invest the writer with special powers, in part because we want to experience the romance vicariously. . . . When we confuse the writing with the writer, we often expect her to be a stronger or more sensitive or more developed human being. . . . Acknowledging writing as work might have pervasive consequences. It might result in a less neurotic relationship between writers and readers. It might encourage better wages and working conditions for artists. It might inspire a clearer portrayal of working-class people in our books. It might open a light on how art can emerge from and contribute to an impulse for social change. Doing Without the Gods</p>
        <p>Cultures define themselves in the stories of their beginnings, and for that purpose, the scholar Dudley Young suggests, mythology has often been a more efficient tool than science. This is from "Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War" (St. Martin's).</p>
        <p>Science, to put it bluntly, is uneasy with beginnings. Mythology, on the contrary, is concerned above all with what happened "in the beginning." . . . Its signature is "Once upon a time," and its characteristic way of bridging the gap between nonbeing and being is to imagine gods and goddesses to step over it. But it differs most importantly from science in that its explanatory account of how we began is also a prescriptive account of how subsequent beginnings (which renew the cosmos) should proceed; the Last Supper, for example, tells us not only how the Christian era began but how its energies can be periodically renewed in a communion meal that commemorates and recalls its inception. Modern poets such as Wallace Stevens have inherited from the myth makers of old the disposition to supply the perennial human need for once-upon-a-time stories that also inform our own beginnings, but they realize that such stories must on the whole do without the gods and goddesses of old, about whom we have become skeptical. Our Restless Species</p>
        <p>Humans, the biologist John Janovy Jr. observes, are among the most footloose of species, relying in part on travel to help us define ourselves. This is from "Vermilion Sea: A Naturalist's Journey in Baja California" (Houghton Mifflin).</p>
        <p>Pilgrimages seem to be almost instinctive, or at least derived from behaviors now so ingrained in our species that it's difficult to distinguish between genetic and social origins. Of all the animals that migrate, we are surely among the most restless. But humans retain the influence of the geophysical habitat in which they pass their formative years. And often, it seems, we are drawn back to our childhood homes -- if not physically, then mentally; if not out of love, then out of curiosity; if not by necessity, then by desire. Through such returnings we find out who we are. The Decline of Artful Swearing</p>
        <p>We tend to believe that we live in the most enlightened of times, a view not borne out -- at least in the arena of frank language -- by a close study of history, as Geoffrey Hughes notes in "Swearing: A Social History of Foul Language, Oaths and Profanity in English" (Blackwell).</p>
        <p>Although the view that there has been considerable liberation in modern times has much truth in it, the interpretation of a steady advance to enlightenment is simplistic. Such a view would hold that the constraints of medieval times were overthrown in the Renaissance, that there was a steady liberalization through the Enlightenment, a Puritanical regression in Victorian times, and a final throwing off of the shackles in the postwar era. Curiously, nearly all of these generalizations are inaccurate. Chaucer and many medieval writers had more freedom than their Renaissance successors; the Enlightenment saw a steady clamping down on strong or risque language, while the Victorian era showed a remarkable efflorescence of strong and foul language, in some ways surpassing that of modern times. However, it took place out of earshot of "polite society."</p>
