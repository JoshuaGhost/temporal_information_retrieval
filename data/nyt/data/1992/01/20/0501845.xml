        <p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said today that she expected 370,000 Cambodian refugees to begin returning to their war-ravaged homeland in March or April.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, Sadako Ogata, said the United Nations wanted to have as many of the refugees as possible out of border camps in Thailand and back home in Cambodia in time for the planting season that begins this spring.</p>
        <p>"Time is very precious," she said at a meeting with reporters in Bangkok, her last stop on an inspection tour of preparations in Thailand and Cambodia for the United Nations-sponsored repatriation program. "The desire and the pressure to start soon is very heavy."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ogata warned, however, that the repatriation effort was still fraught with problems, not least of which is raising the estimated $109 million needed to pay for it, and she left open the possibility that many refugees might have to delay their departure from Thailand until 1993.</p>
        <p>The refugees now living in the border camps fled to Thailand seeking sanctuary from the Cambodian civil war, which began in 1979, and thousands of Cambodian children in the camps have known no other home. The war ended last year, at least on paper, as the result of a United Nations-brokered peace settlement.</p>
        <p>But as a result of the long civil war, the Cambodia countryside is littered with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mines. The refugees will also face threats from violent gangs of bandits operating inside Cambodia; from disease, including epidemics of malaria; and from the possibility that the fragile peace process might collapse and throw the nation back into civil war.</p>
        <p>Despite the threats, Mrs. Ogata said, a recent survey of the refugees showed that the vast majority wanted to go back to Cambodia.</p>
        <p>The repatriation should begin as soon as possible, she said, to allow the refugees, almost all of them farmers or from farm families, to take part in the planting season, so they can feed themselves next year.</p>
