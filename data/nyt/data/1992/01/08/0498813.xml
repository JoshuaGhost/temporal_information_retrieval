        <p>Among the contestants will be Dr. Dan Hertz and Natalie Hertz of Harrison, N.Y., who recently returned to tournament play after a long absence and won a Regional Senior Master Pairs in Pine Mountain, Ga., with help from the diagramed deal. They avoided the obvious four-spade contract, which would have been hopeless, and Dr. Hertz played skillfully to overcome the bad break in spades and bring home three no-trump.</p>
        <p>East won the opening heart lead with the king, an error, and continued with the ace and four. South won, cashed the ace and king of spades and reviewed the situation. He felt sure that East held the club king and a diamond honor to justify the opening bid, so he led the diamond ten to the king, led to the ace and reached this position:  [ DIAGRAM ]</p>
        <p>The diamond three was led to West's jack, and East reluctantly gave up one of his heart winners. West exited with his last diamond to dummy's nine and East gave up his remaining heart. South discarded his club six, surrendered a spade trick and claimed his game.</p>
