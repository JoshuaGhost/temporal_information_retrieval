        <p>REMEMBER calories? Those quaint things you were supposed to count, and by eliminating 3,500, lose a pound?</p>
        <p>In the last few years, toting up calories has fallen out of favor. These days, the word is fat. Eliminate it or sharply reduce it, the thinking goes, and you will lose weight. By the new orthodoxy, there is no need even to think about calories.</p>
        <p>The true believers are everywhere. They rave about low-fat diets that let them eat all they want and never feel hungry. One friend said she could snack constantly on low-fat frozen yogurt; another has become partial to pretzels. The evidence is impressive: they are thinner, and they don't seem at all grouchy, like the starved waifs of calorie-counting days.</p>
        <p>Bolstered by accumulating scientific evidence, magazines have been running stories about this new approach to dieting, with titles like "Lose Weight Like Magic," in Prevention, or "Diets: Read This and Eat" in Allure.</p>
        <p>The rules seem simple: Eat as much as you want, but make it low in fat.</p>
        <p>Well, I tried it, and like anything, it can be abused.</p>
        <p>I can't say that I stuck to my version of the diet for long. But a short experiment that included the consumption of embarrassing amounts of low-fat chocolate desserts and a subsequent weight gain indicated that my original hunch was right: calories really do count. And interviews with weight-loss researchers confirmed that while a low-fat diet may lead to weight loss, this approach isn't the free-for-all that some people envision.</p>
        <p>Here is the problem: If you eat whatever you want, but choose only from the universe of</p>
        <p>naturally</p>
        <p>low-fat foods, you will probably lose weight, because you will be filling up on skinless chicken breasts, fish, rice, pasta, vegetables and fruit. But if you choose from the universe of</p>
        <p>all</p>
        <p>available low-fat foods, the result can be very different. These days, you can get nonfat frozen yogurt, nonfat cake and nonfat candy. You can get the stuff that binges are made of.</p>
        <p>Granted, some people have such strong emotional needs for food that they can binge on anything, even carrots or sweet potatoes or rice. But most people are more inclined to overeat desserts, and the profusion of low-fat foods that use white flour and refined sugar has resulted in many choices that are fairly high in calories. A medium-size apple, for instance, weighs about eight ounces and has about 65 calories; eight ounces of a nonfat Entenmann's cake, however, has 560 calories. Both lack fat, but the calorie difference is enormous.</p>
        <p>The low-fat diet, when it works, succeeds because it cuts down on the number of calories consumed. That happens because protein and carbohydrates, the other components of food, have fewer calories per gram than fat; by eating less fat but about the same amount of food, one consumes fewer calories.</p>
        <p>"When you reduce the amount of fat in food, you automatically reduce the amount of calories you consume," said Dr. David Levitsky, a Cornell University nutrition and psychology professor who led a widely reported study on weight loss through fat reduction. It was described last year in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</p>
        <p>But he conceded that if people binged on high-calorie, low-fat foods, they would not lose weight. The secret is to avoid binges, which he links with dieting. Binges, he said, occur when people are conscious of dieting and thus develop a sense of deprivation that induces them to seek more food as compensation. The best way to lose weight, he said, is to choose low-fat foods in amounts that satisfy hunger.</p>
        <p>"If you binge, forget it," he said.</p>
        <p>Rather than eating low-fat versions of foods like ice cream and cake, Dr. Levitsky said, Americans would be better off eating foods that are naturally low in fat, like grains and vegetables, because they would also get numerous nutritional benefits.</p>
        <p>But for marketers, there is money to be made in giving Americans more acceptable versions of the foods they love. Hundreds of products that are low in fat but also relatively low in nutritional benefits, like cookies and cake, are arriving on supermarket shelves, and the future promises far more, especially as new fat substitutes become available.</p>
        <p>If Americans eat those foods in moderation, they may be helpful. But if they do not, they will be sadly disappointed when it comes to weight loss.</p>
        <p>"You can gain weight on a low-fat diet," said Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., which tries to help people prevent or cure heart disease through changes in diet and exercise.</p>
        <p>He said that participants in his studies who consume a low-fat vegetarian diet lose about 22 pounds a year, on average, even while eating more food than before. When you eat unprocessed food, the bulk and fiber let you get full without eating excess calories.</p>
        <p>But that does not apply to low-fat desserts. Dr. Ornish said some people could eat a whole cake without feeling satisfied.</p>
        <p>"Some of our study participants began to gain weight because they were eating these products," he said. "We had to educate them."</p>
        <p>"If you reduce fat, you can eat more," he said, but not more foods that are high in simple carbohydrates, like sugar.</p>
        <p>The important thing, he said, is to become more aware of what you are eating, to pay attention to cues that signal hunger and satiation, and to use methods other than eating to deal with anxiety. Mindless eating is the enemy.</p>
        <p>"If you really enjoy it," he said, "you don't have to have the excess." One taste of an ultra-rich chocolate ice cream, he said, is probably more satisfying than a whole pint of some ersatz concoction.</p>
        <p>True. Very true. But if your newly enlightened state doesn't hold and you slip back into your old ways, how do you hide the ice cream so you can't get to it during the 23 hours 55 minutes between bites?</p>
