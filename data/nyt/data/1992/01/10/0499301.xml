        <p>Supervision of a special narcotics unit is being tightened after a report has warned of "serious problems," New York City Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said yesterday. But he added that there was no evidence of systemic corruption in the unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said he had also received a proposal to team uniformed beat officers with undercover narcotics officers from the unit in question, the Organized Crime Control Bureau. The effort would be to bring drug enforcement under his community policing philosophy.</p>
        <p>Although neither Mr. Brown nor the Chief of Department, David W. Scott, would elaborate on the proposal that Chief Scott drafted, it was seen as a way of allowing beat officers familiar with assigned neighborhoods to identify narcotics problems and go after drug dealers. The plan would also provide checks and balances against corruption among both beat and narcotics officers.</p>
        <p>The department's chief corruption fighter, Chief of Inspectional Services Daniel F. Sullivan, recently sent a report to Mr. Brown warning that "there are very serious problems" in the Crime Control Bureau, a central command that since 1971 has been investigating narcotics, organized crime and vice. It was created after the Knapp Commission, investigating police corruption, found there had been systematic payoffs to special units and precincts, especially in drug enforcement.</p>
        <p>Chief Sullivan said two cases last year involving allegations of lying and falsifying records to make arrests showed that "an unusual and disturbing trend appears to be developing" in the bureau.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that the two episodes were "disturbing," but that "We don't see any systemic problem in the department."</p>
        <p>The Commissioner said the report had its beginnings in a request from him in May that Chief Sullivan's agency analyze narcotics enforcement operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said Chief Sullivan recommended that the department's Office of Management Analysis and Planning investigate duplication in drug enforcement. That office found no duplication, Mr. Brown said, but Chief Sullivan was asked to comment on the office's findings. 2 Versions of Report</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said Chief Sullivan then expressed concern about the integrity of the bureau and questioned how it fit into the community policing concept.</p>
        <p>Chief Sullivan, who is retiring in May, had a different version of how his report came to be written. He said on Wednesday that he had sent an unsolicited letter to the Commissioner on Dec. 3. Yesterday, he declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that John J. Holmes, Chief of Organized Crime Control, had broadened training of supervisors to insure integrity of operations.</p>
