        <p>The first thing A. J. Liebling did on arriving in Paris in 1939 was to have lunch. "A wartime lunch," he reported dismissively, "just marennes, Pouilly-Fuisse, caille vendangeuse, and Grands-Echezeaux."</p>
        <p>Oysters, quail and two Burgundies; not a bad way to get started on a war.</p>
        <p>Liebling wrote for The New Yorker from 1935 until his death in 1963. He wrote about New York, about combat, about boxing and the press. And, more or less en passant, he wrote continually about food and drink. With him, it was not just an academic subject.</p>
        <p>"The first requisite for writing about food," he insisted, "was having a good appetite." He qualified. Berton Roueche, who joined The New Yorker some years after Liebling, recalled their first meeting:</p>
        <p>"I was new and didn't know anyone when he appeared in the door of my cubicle and said: 'Hey, kid, you want to have lunch?'</p>
        <p>"We went out to 44th street, to the old Cortile. I don't remember what I had, but he ordered two roast chickens and he ate them all. Even the bones."</p>
        <p>Abbott Joseph Liebling, for such was his full name, intoned descriptions of classic French dishes with the same reverence Thomas Wolfe reserved for the names of railroads. A lunch in Paris in 1955 "began with a truite au bleu -- a live trout simply done to death in hot water, like a Roman emperor in his bath. It was served up with enough melted butter to thrombose a regiment of Paul Dudley Whites, and accompanied, as was right, by an Alsatian wine -- a Lacrimae Sanctae Odiliae."</p>
        <p>There follows a brief digression involving that wine and a girl in Strasbourg. Then he returns to the lunch. "We had a magnificent daube provencale, because we were faithful to la cuisine bourgeoise, and then pintadeaux -- young guinea hens, simply and tenderly roasted -- with the first asparagus of the year, to show our fidelity to la cuisine classique.</p>
        <p>"We had clarets with both courses -- a Petrus with the daube, a Cheval Blanc with the guineas."</p>
        <p>His companion had been "discounseled" on Burgundies by a small-minded physician. This gave Liebling momentary pause. He was reassured when the friend drank "a bottle and a half of Krug after luncheon."</p>
        <p>"We had three bottles between us," he reported; "one to our loves, one to our countries, and one for symmetry, the last being on the house."</p>
        <p>The point here is not to do honor yet again to Liebling's heroic gullet or to his unmatchable prose. They earned him the French Legion of Honor. It is instead to call attention to the fact that he wrote just as engagingly, as perceptively, about wine and liquor as he did about food.</p>
        <p>His trenchermen, real and fictional, never fail to accompany their Lucullan meals with great wines, and they invariably work up to their feasts with a variety of other potions. In a memorable passage, Col. John R. Stingo, Liebling's raffish muse and fictionalized boon companion who featured regularly in his New Yorker writing, described one lunchtime itinerary of a turn-of-the century New Orleans newspaper editor named O'Malley. His "prandial relaxation," Stingo related, began "at the bar of the St. Charles Hotel, where he had a three-bagger of Sazeracs," moved on to Hyman's bar on Common Street "where he increased his aperitif by four silver gin fizzes and after that over to Farbacher's saloon on Royal where he had a schooner or two of Boston Club punch."</p>
        <p>After this workout, O'Malley strolled on to Antoine's where he consumed an immense meal accompanied by "a magnum of Chateau La Mission-Haut-Brion of the year of the comet  [ 1811 ] ," a dipper of Calvados from a cask brought to Louisiana from Normandy in 1721, and an espresso fetched by the maitre d'hotel from "a dive operated by the Mafia."</p>
        <p>By his own admission and from the testimony of friends, it's clear that Joe Liebling drank a great deal. Said Raymond Sokolov, in his biography "Wayward Reporter" (Harper &amp; Row, 1980), "He was certainly never guilty of the bourgeois virtue of deferred gratification."</p>
        <p>George Bernard Shaw once characterized marriage as a remarkable institution because, he said, it combined the maximum temptation with the maximum opportunity. Much the same could be said of Paris in 1926, Liebling's novitiate year as a trencherman and wine lover. At the Restaurant des Beaux-Arts on the rue of the same name, where he did much of his early training, the half-bottle of Tavel rose that accompanied most of his meals cost about two cents.</p>
        <p>On the days he was scheduled to pick up his remittance money at the Credit Lyonnais across the river, he would stop first for lunch at the Beaux-Arts and move up to Cote-Rotie or even Hermitage, either of which cost only a few cents more.</p>
        <p>Liebling believed in the value of hardship in the development of the palate. When first he encountered great Burgundy, he was grateful for those days of Tavel rose and other Rhone wines at the Beaux-Arts.</p>
        <p>"Drinking Richebourg without this training," he wrote, "would have been like a debutant prizefighter's meeting Archie Moore in a feature bout; he would not be up to it and would never know what hit him."</p>
        <p>"Burgundy," he said in one disquisition, "has the advantage of a clear, direct appeal, immediately pleasing and easy to comprehend on a primary level. This is a quality compatible with greatness. Shakespeare and Tolstoy, because more accessible, are not necessarily inferior to, say, Donne and Dostoyevsky.</p>
        <p>"Burgundy thus has two publics: one (which it shares with Bordeaux) that likes it for its profound as well as its superficial qualities, and one that likes it only because it is easy to like."</p>
        <p>It was this double audience, he wrote in the mid-1950's, that was responsible for the outrageous prices of good Burgundy both in Paris and New York. "If you like both clarets and Burgundies," he advised, "you can do as well with two dollars invested in a bottle of claret as with four dollars invested in Burgundy."</p>
        <p>Joe Liebling died in 1963. What would he have said of today's wine market where the Richebourg he loved sells for $300 or more a bottle, and second-rate restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic demand $30 for a second-rate cru Beaujolais?</p>
        <p>Liebling's comments on wine were disarming and unpretentious. The business of florid wine description had not yet flowered in his time. "Hints of cigar-box," "gobs of fruit," "undertones of toasty oak," and similar excesses had yet to become the lingua franca of corksniffers. We can only guess at how Liebling would have handled such felonious assaults on the language he loved.</p>
        <p>Not that Liebling couldn't discuss an individual wine vividly and intelligently when the need arose. One night in 1955 in Paris, a guest salvaged a boring dinner in the boring 16th Arrondissement by producing two bottles of Veuve Clicquot 1919.</p>
        <p>The 36-year-old Champagne, Liebling reported, "was tart without brashness -- a refined but effective understatement of younger Champagnes, which run too much to rhetoric, at best. Even so," he continued, "the force was all there, to judge from the two glasses that were a shade more than my share. The wine still had a discreet</p>
        <p>cordon</p>
        <p>-- the ring of bubbles that forms inside the glass -- and it had developed the color known as 'partridge eye.'</p>
        <p>"I have never seen a partridge's eye because the bird, unlike woodcock, is served without the head, but the color the term indicates is that of serous blood or a maple leaf on the turn."</p>
        <p>Liebling's own taste in Champagne seemed to favor a house that has since apparently disappeared, Irroy, of Reims. On meeting a Parisian procurer who claimed to drink nothing but Champagne, the writer wondered whether the sweat he saw dripping from the man's "fat ear" might taste like Irroy '28.</p>
        <p>Thrice married, usually broke, plagued by gout and increasingly frequent depression, Liebling's own life was more troubled than his light-hearted reportage ever let on. His friends believed his eating and drinking to excess was in part a reaction to the reality of his life. Consuming fine French food and great vintages, he was the boulevardier, the flaneur, who passed through life effortlessly and with consummate grace.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, his third marriage, to the writer Jean Stafford, was mostly a happy one. They spent time at his retreat in the Springs, on Long Island, where he gardened now and then and kept a respectable cellar. "He entertained on the grand scale," said Philip Hamburger, the New Yorker writer. "He really relished being surrounded by people he liked and serving the best of food and drink. He was generous to a fault; he gave a lot more than he got."</p>
        <p>What he gave mostly was a body of journalism that remains fresh and deeply moving almost three decades after his death.</p>
        <p>One last story. In Paris in the 1950's after a long absence, he discovered that a favorite restaurant had changed hands and that the legendary owner, a Madame G., was gone.</p>
        <p>An friend related that she had fallen ill and retired.</p>
        <p>"What is the matter with her?," Liebling demanded.</p>
        <p>"I think," the friend replied, "it was trying to read Simone de Beauvoir." TASTINGS  Los Vascos Sauvignon Blanc, Colchagua Valley, Chile; about $6.</p>
        <p>The Chileans make good sauvignon blanc, and this one, from Chateau Lafite-Rothschild's partner in the Colchagua Valley, is one of the best. Outside the Loire Valley in France, sauvignon blanc has a tendency to heaviness and insufficient acid. Too many California versions of this wine come off like would-be chardonnays, and if there is anything the world doesn't need at the moment, it's more chardonnays. This wine has a nice bite to it; it isn't too heavy and has held its youthful freshness admirably. It is the perfect wine to go with fish. The days of Chilean riesling at 89 cents are long in the past, but as bargains go, this one will be quite difficult to beat.</p>
