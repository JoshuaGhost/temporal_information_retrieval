        <p>The International Monetary Fund is expected to approve a $2 billion loan for Brazil on Wednesaday and to support President Fernando Collor de Mello's economic program, Government officials and diplomats said.</p>
        <p>The loan, which Brazil requested in December, is a vital step toward restoring the country's international financial credibility.</p>
        <p>Brazil, Latin America's biggest debtor, also needs I.M.F. money and confidence to shore up a harsh domestic austerity program. The I.M.F. sent jitters through the Brazilian Government earlier this month when it postponed a decision on the loan. But officials say no further delays are expected.</p>
        <p>"Everything is proceeding smoothly, according to our information," Planning Secretary Pedro Parente said in a telephone interview today. He said he expected the I.M.F. to approve the loan on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Local financial markets rose strongly today on expectations that the loan would be approved, with stocks jumping 6.4 percent on foreign buying interest.</p>
