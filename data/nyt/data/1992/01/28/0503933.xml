        <p>New Orchestra of Westchester  State University College at Purchase</p>
        <p>One of the more ambitious musical commemorations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in the New York area was presented this evening by Paul Lustig Dunkel and his New Orchestra of Westchester: a culturally diverse program called Music America, featuring performances by the Morgan State University Choir under its conductor, Nathan Carter.</p>
        <p>The major work was "Cry the Beloved Country," a concert suite compiled by David Drew from Kurt Weill's musical drama "Lost in the Stars," which was based on an anti-apartheid novel by Alan Paton. In addition, there were Aaron Copland's "Latin-American Sketches" and George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue."</p>
        <p>The performances were generally excellent. Andre Solomon-Glover, a baritone, and Cynthia Clarey, a soprano, were affecting soloists in the Weill, which also featured the Russian Chorus of New York. The pianist in the Gershwin was a 16-year-old, Terrence Wilson, who produced some spectacular strokes and a few spectacular misses; he ultimately showed more potential than accomplishment, but at least he was never tentative.</p>
        <p>The New Orchestra, actually eight years old, made a fine first impression in the small, rather eccentric deployments required here. Mr. Dunkel, who is also the resident conductor of the  American Composers Orchestra, has drawn some of the top players from the New York freelance pool into what seemed a crack band.</p>
