        <p>Rap at the Palladium</p>
        <p>P.M. Dawn, the Palladium, 126 East 14th Street, Manhattan, (212) 473-7171. Live hip-hop concerts by new groups are always an uncertain proposition, but P.M. Dawn's second American performance is more promising than most. The New Jersey duo's first album mixes easygoing raps influenced by De La Soul and full-fledged songs about this life and the next; it's off-the-wall and utterly assured. Tonight at midnight, with doors opening at 10 P.M. for dancing. Admission is $15.  Steve Lacy's Sax</p>
        <p>Steve Lacy, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, at Mulberry Street, Manhattan, (212) 219-3055. The soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy is to perform in two settings. Tonight at 9 and midnight, he offers solos that are likely to be unhurried, meticulous, calmly far-reaching explorations of angular melodies; tickets are $12. Tomorrow at 9 P.M., he joins Samm Bennett on percussion and Tom Cora on cello as part of Third Person, a continuing series of collaborations. Tickets are $10.</p>
