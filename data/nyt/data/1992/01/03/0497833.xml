        <p>Who is the busiest member of the British royal family? TIM O'DONOVAN, a London insurance broker who has kept track of the public engagements -- opening ceremonies, receptions, banquets, investitures, luncheons and the like -- for members of the family for 13 years, said that PRINCESS ANNE ranks first in industriousness, outdoing even her mother, QUEEN ELIZABETH II.</p>
        <p>Princess Anne had 504 engagements in 1991 in Britain, and 241 abroad; the Queen had 455 in Britain, 126 abroad. Anne started to catch up with her mother in 1985, Mr. O'Donovan said, and she has been tireless ever since.</p>

        <p>Who is the busiest member of the British royal family? TIM O'DONOVAN, a London insurance broker who has kept track of the public engagements -- opening ceremonies, receptions, banquets, investitures, luncheons and the like -- for members of the family for 13 years, said that PRINCESS ANNE ranks first in industriousness, outdoing even her mother, QUEEN ELIZABETH II.</p>
        <p>Princess Anne had 504 engagements in 1991 in Britain, and 241 abroad; the Queen had 455 in Britain, 126 abroad. Anne started to catch up with her mother in 1985, Mr. O'Donovan said, and she has been tireless ever since.</p>
        <p>He said he began tracking royal schedules in 1979 because "it occurred to me that people didn't know what the royal family did."</p>
        <p>"So I decided to look at the court circular pages published in The Times of London and analyze them for a year," he said. "I did it purely for my own interest." The data proved to be in such demand that now Buckingham Palace refers inquiries to him. He said he spends about four hours a week on the project.</p>
        <p>His tabulations show that the younger members of the family are improving the frequency with which they perform their civic duties. PRINCE CHARLES'S appearances rose last year to 460, from 389 in 1990; the PRINCESS OF WALES'S went up to 397, from 323, and the DUCHESS OF YORK'S rose to 213, from 108.</p>
        <p>Who's at the bottom of the list? PRINCESS MARGARET, who fell to 103 engagements last year, from 154 in 1990. PRINCE ANDREW had 107, up from 29, but it should be remembered that he is in the Navy. QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MOTHER undertook 102, but then she is 91 years old.</p>
