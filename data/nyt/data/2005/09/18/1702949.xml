        <p>THE MAD COOK</p>
        <p>OF PYMATUNING</p>
        <p>By Christopher</p>
        <p>Lehmann-Haupt.</p>
        <p>309 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $24.</p>
        <p>ANYONE who has taken high school English knows what happens when a group of boys is stranded in a remote spot without much supervision: social strictures fall away and chaos ensues. Readers of Christopher Lehmann-Haupt's new novel may anticipate a similar outcome, since it would seem to have all the trappings of an American ''Lord of the Flies,'' a chilling story of youth run amok.</p>
        <p>''The Mad Cook of Pymatuning'' unfolds in an isolated, slightly seedy boys' camp in northwestern Pennsylvania. Camp Seneca's cabins border a forest called the Forbidden Woods, whose landscape is dominated by a dead tree with branches that evoke ''a skeletal hand clutching for the sky.'' It's 1952 and in Washington, Senator Joe McCarthy has been zealously tracking his prey, a fact that Lehmann-Haupt -- formerly the senior daily book reviewer for The New York Times and the author of another novel, ''A Crooked Man,'' as well as a memoir, ''Me and DiMaggio'' -- uses to add an extra whiff of offstage menace. Not that he needs it. Jerry Muller, the narrator who looks back at the novel's events ''nearly a lifetime later,'' reveals in the opening chapter that his final summer at Camp Seneca was ''truly horrific.''</p>
        <p>Seventeen-year-old Jerry, a junior counselor, begins to sense that his beloved camp has changed for the worse as soon as he arrives from New York with his young half brother and joins in the traditional opening-day softball game, despite being on crutches because of a skiing accident. Always competitive and chaotic, this year's game turns brutal when Jerry knocks down the small son of the camp owner, Woody Wentworth, in a base-path collision in the fading light. Called to Woody's office the next morning, Jerry expects a rebuke, but to his surprise and unease he's congratulated for providing a test of the injured child's mettle.</p>
        <p>It gives away little to note that this encounter is only one of the early signs of a disturbing imbalance: despite the presence of a few ringers (one of Jerry's fellow counselors is a hothead who throws sucker punches), the kids at Camp Seneca aren't the problem. It's the adults who bear watching, starting with Woody, who has fallen under the spell of the camp's new administrator. A Seneca Indian, the charismatic and physically powerful Buck Silverstone both fascinates and repels Jerry, who can't help wondering why Buck disappears so often into the Forbidden Woods.</p>
        <p>Lehmann-Haupt conveys the broadest hint of his intentions through his book's title. The eponymous cook turns out to be the protagonist of a hair-raising tale the counselors enact around the campfire, a meatcutter who takes his skill with the cleaver way too far. And, sure enough, the novel gradually evolves into a satisfying literary version of the sort of unlikely but horrifying yarn that keeps first-time campers awake all night. The bloody summer also prompts Jerry's coming-of-age, through which he learns something about racism, sexuality and his own family's personal conflicts.</p>
        <p>Like all thrillers, this one requires a certain suspension of disbelief. It seems odd, for example, that none of the camp's strange goings-on arouse any parental concern, even in an era of relatively laissez-faire child-rearing. We know that Jerry's father has his reasons for ignoring potential problems at Camp Seneca. And yet. Nowadays, news of the boxing match in which Buck pummels a counselor into bloody insensibility would surely invite a convoy of rescuing S.U.V.'s. Then again, while at heart an old-fashioned psychodrama, Lehmann-Haupt's novel also has a relentless determinism. Even the most protective parent couldn't stave off its cataclysmic finale.</p>
