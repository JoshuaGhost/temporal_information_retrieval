        <p>As a native Louisianian who lived in New Orleans for more than 12 years and who now lives in New York City, I believe that a national newspaper needs to be not only more vigilant in its reporting on other parts of the country, but also more comparative.</p>
        <p>For example, how did life in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans compare with that in a poor black area of New York City? What makes life better or worse? As a social scientist, I know there are lots of sophisticated statistical ways to compare these things, but a newspaper can strive to put these comparisons into concrete form for readers not familiar with that research.</p>
        <p>REBECCA MORTON  New York, Sept. 11, 2005</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of politics at New York University.</p>
