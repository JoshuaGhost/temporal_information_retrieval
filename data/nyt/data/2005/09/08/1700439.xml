        <p>A Los Angeles group declared its intention yesterday to bid for the 2016 Olympics, but the future of a potential New York bid remained far from clear two months after the city's failed attempt to land the 2012 Games.</p>
        <p>The United States Olympic Committee has not announced its timetable for selecting an American bid city for 2016, but a committee led by Barry Sanders, a lawyer, and backed by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles unofficially kicked off the bidding season with its announcement.</p>
        <p>''This is a city with so many obvious attributes, because of what kind of city it is, the climate, the spirit of the city,'' Sanders said in a telephone interview. ''We think Los Angeles was made for the Olympic Games.''</p>
        <p>Since New York lost a five-city race for the 2012 Games in July, when London won the vote by members of the International Olympic Committee, city officials have not rushed to embrace another run for 2016. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has put off any serious consideration of another bid until after the November election. He emphasized during the 2012 process that New York could not guarantee it would return for another bid.</p>
        <p>When Bloomberg has addressed the topic recently, he has said that the city would probably need to find another bid leader willing to spend the time and raise the money necessary because he doubted that Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, the 2012 bid leader, would continue in the role.</p>
        <p>Doctoroff, who said yesterday that he did not want to comment on his future role, spent 11 years and said he raised about $35 million in private donations for the 2012 bid.</p>
        <p>That does not mean other officials from the 2012 group could not revive the bid, which has been discussed among some of the board members.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. will give them plenty of time to consider the options. At a meeting Saturday in Denver, the committee will discuss how to choose the next American bid city. It is a process that officials have promised will be different from the one that gave New York the nod over San Francisco in 2002, because the U.S.O.C. has reorganized. In 2002, the committee's 123-member board voted on a winner. Now, the committee's board has been reduced to 11 members.</p>
        <p>Some of the changes will also be a response to problems in the 2012 process. There was friction between the U.S.O.C. and NYC2012 over the bid's reliance on the West Side Stadium plan, which was rejected by New York State officials only a month before the I.O.C. vote, becoming a major factor in the bid's defeat.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. has vowed to institute a rigorous set of selection criteria to choose the next city, including an emphasis on having facilities approved long before the I.O.C. selection.</p>
        <p>But those criteria are not likely to be determined until this fall, when cities will be offered the chance to apply. A winner is likely to be chosen by 2007 for the I.O.C. selection process, which will end in 2009.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles group's eagerness to bid comes as no surprise. The city failed to make the list of finalists the U.S.O.C. considered in 2002, but it has long sent signals that it would return for the 2016 race.</p>
        <p>Sanders has a long history of involvement with Olympic sports, including serving as general counsel to the organizing committee of the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which was led by the U.S.O.C.'s current chairman, Peter Ueberroth.</p>
        <p>Ueberroth, though, has no role with Sanders's group, a U.S.O.C. spokesman, Darryl Seibel, said. And Sanders said he was not relying on his long association with Ueberroth.</p>
        <p>''He would not let us compromise his integrity, and we would not attempt to,'' Sanders said. ''We not are advised at all by Peter Ueberroth.''</p>
        <p>Sanders emphasized that Los Angeles offered an extensive array of existing facilities, including the same Coliseum that was used in the 1932 and 1984 Games for the opening and closing ceremonies and for track and field.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Los Angeles's experience as an Olympic host will be a positive or a negative to the I.O.C. Sanders says that the selection of London as the site of an Olympics for a third time signals that the I.O.C. is not reluctant to tread on old ground.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles is the only American city to play host for a Summer Olympics more than once. Part of New York's unsuccessful pitch for 2012 was that it had never been the host for the Olympics and would help break new ground for the Games.</p>
