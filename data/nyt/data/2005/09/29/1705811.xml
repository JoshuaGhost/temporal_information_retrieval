        <p>Being vilified as a ''rogue district attorney,'' a ''fanatic'' and ''an unabashed partisan zealot,'' among other epithets, was not the worst part of his day, said Ronnie Earle, hours after announcing the indictment of Representative Tom DeLay and two associates.</p>
        <p>''Mostly, I haven't had any lunch,'' said Mr. Earle, the Travis County prosecutor, speaking from his office in Austin. ''I ate an energy bar. It helped a little. That stopped me from gnawing on people's heads.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Being vilified as a ''rogue district attorney,'' a ''fanatic'' and ''an unabashed partisan zealot,'' among other epithets, was not the worst part of his day, said Ronnie Earle, hours after announcing the indictment of Representative Tom DeLay and two associates.</p>
        <p>''Mostly, I haven't had any lunch,'' said Mr. Earle, the Travis County prosecutor, speaking from his office in Austin. ''I ate an energy bar. It helped a little. That stopped me from gnawing on people's heads.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle, 63, an institution and endangered species -- a Texas Democrat -- now in his eighth elected four-year term, said he was ignoring the attacks by Mr. DeLay and his supporters after Mr. DeLay, the powerful Texas Republican and House majority leader, was charged with conspiring to violate Texas election law by contributing corporate money to candidates for the Texas Legislature in 2002.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Earle would not let it pass, it turned out. ''I find they often accuse others of doing what they themselves do,'' he said. ''And what else are they going to say?''</p>
        <p>''This is about protecting the integrity of our electoral system and I couldn't just ignore it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle, a former state representative who won his first election for district attorney in 1976 and has run away with every race since, is famously unbridled, responding last year to an earlier attack by the majority leader by saying, ''Being called vindictive and partisan by Tom DeLay is like being called ugly by a frog.''</p>
        <p>When Congressional Republicans sought last year to protect Mr. DeLay by changing the rules requiring an indicted leader to step down, Mr. Earle condemned the action as ''open contempt for moral values'' in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times. The move was later rescinded.</p>
        <p>Yet on Wednesday at a news conference in a law library near the Travis County Courthouse, Mr. Earle, in announcing the indictment, was uncharacteristically close-mouthed and stern as he turned away questions about the evidence and other aspects of the investigation. But he denied that politics had played any role, as Mr. DeLay and his lawyers claimed.</p>
        <p>''I would expect that that would be their response,'' Mr. Earle said. ''This is what they believe of themselves.''</p>
        <p>''We have, over the years, prosecuted a number of elected officials,'' he said. ''At last count that stood at 15, 12 of whom were Democrats and 3 of whom were Republicans.''</p>
        <p>That the defense will seek to make Mr. Earle and his record an issue quickly became clear in comments by Mr. DeLay's lead lawyer, Dick DeGuerin of Houston. ''Tom DeLay changed the state of Texas,'' the lawyer said in a separate news conference in Austin. ''Nobody can deny that, and Ronnie Earle wants to destroy him because of that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeGuerin had represented the most prominent target of Mr. Earle until now in a case that represented perhaps the lowest point of the district attorney's career: the prosecution of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle, who himself had toyed with seeking the Senate seat in 1993 that had been vacated by Lloyd Bentsen, won an indictment against Ms. Hutchison on charges of having used her office as Texas treasurer for political ends. But as her trial was about to start, the judge declined to assure that documents obtained from her office by subpoena, without a search warrant, would be admissible. Facing the loss of crucial evidence and, Mr. Earle said, unwilling to risk a precedent that could erase the wall between politics and state business, he withdrew the case.</p>
        <p>The judge, angry at the tactic, refused to allow the case merely to be dropped and ordered a verdict of acquittal. Mr. Earle was branded a coward or bungler. It also gave rise to a joke that the bad news for Mr. DeLay was that he might get indicted; the good news was that he would be prosecuted by Mr. Earle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle gave his critics new fodder on May 12 when he was the featured speaker in Dallas for the Texas Values in Action Coalition, a Democratic political action committee. The prosecutor talked about his investigation into Republican corporate contributions and mentioned Mr. DeLay. ''This case is not just about Tom DeLay,'' he told the audience. ''If it isn't this Tom DeLay, it'll be another one, just like one bully replaces the one before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle seemed surprised at the uproar that ensued. ''I'll make that same speech to any group that was interested in open and honest government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, Tina Benkiser, called for his resignation. ''This proves once and for all that Ronnie Earle is a hypocrite on a political witch hunt,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earle has long shrugged off his critics, saying his record of putting crooked officials and violent criminals in jail speaks for itself. But he once told Texas Monthly that he did not want to be buried in the State Cemetery in Austin, but instead wished to be cremated. He had made so many people angry, he said, that they would be lining up to desecrate his grave.</p>
