        <p>Travis Hafner, without a hit in his previous 12 at-bats, stomped into the batter's box in the first inning at Jacobs Field on Thursday night and kicked around lots of dirt. His team was on a three-game losing streak at the worst possible time, with a playoff berth in the balance.</p>
        <p>Hafner scowled and muttered when the home-plate umpire, Chris Guccione, called strikes on two of Casey Fossum's first four pitches. Then Hafner belted a 2-2 slider over the center-field fence to give the Indians a 2-0 lead over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>

        <p>Travis Hafner, without a hit in his previous 12 at-bats, stomped into the batter's box in the first inning at Jacobs Field on Thursday night and kicked around lots of dirt. His team was on a three-game losing streak at the worst possible time, with a playoff berth in the balance.</p>
        <p>Hafner scowled and muttered when the home-plate umpire, Chris Guccione, called strikes on two of Casey Fossum's first four pitches. Then Hafner belted a 2-2 slider over the center-field fence to give the Indians a 2-0 lead over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Roughly two hours later, Hafner had two more hits and the Indians had a 6-0 victory that kept them on pace in the tight race for the American League wild-card berth.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't pressing at all,'' Hafner said, referring to his mini-slump. Of the team's chances for postseason play, Hafner said: ''I wouldn't really say that it's pressure. We've put ourselves in a really good position.''</p>
        <p>C.C. Sabathia, the Cleveland starter, raised his record to 15-10 by working eight shutout innings, giving up five hits and striking out nine. Tampa Bay hitters swung at many first pitches in a game that lasted only 2 hours 21 minutes.</p>
        <p>''We just want to get in, period, any way we can get it,'' Sabathia said of the playoff race. ''We don't have any pressure on us. Nobody expected us to be here.''</p>
        <p>The Indians, second in the A.L. Central, play the first-place Chicago White Sox in three games here over the weekend to finish the regular season.</p>
        <p>Chicago defeated Detroit, 4-2, on Thursday to clinch the division title. Although the Indians could sweep the White Sox to finish the season with the same record, Chicago has secured the division by winning the season series.</p>
        <p>Because the Los Angeles Angels have clinched the A.L. West, the Indians are competing with the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox for the wild card while the Yankees and the Red Sox compete for the A.L. East title.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (94-65) hold a one-game lead over the second-place Red Sox in the East; Cleveland and Boston are tied for the wild-card lead at 93-66.</p>
        <p>After the Indians' game, Hafner rolled his eyes when the television showed a home run by Boston's David Ortiz at Fenway Park that tied the game with Toronto, 4-4, in the eighth inning. Ortiz, who is a designated hitter like Hafner, won the game, 5-4, with a single in the ninth.</p>
        <p>The playoff formula has created a potentially awkward situation. The White Sox have played the last two months under great pressure. Their 15-game lead on Aug. 1 dwindled to a game and a half last weekend.</p>
        <p>Now that the White Sox' tension is gone, their manager, Ozzie Guillen, may rest some regulars. Such a strategy could negatively affect either the Red Sox or the Yankees. One of those teams will finish second in the A.L. East and will need help from Chicago to finish ahead of the Indians for the wild card.</p>
        <p>''I doubt you can say they're not going to go full bore,'' Hafner said of the White Sox. ''I'm sure they are going to come in here wanting to beat us.''</p>
        <p>But in Detroit on Thursday, Mark Buehrle, who will be the starting pitcher for the White Sox on Friday night against Cleveland, was asked the meaning of the Cleveland-Chicago series, and said ''nothing,'' according to The Associated Press. Kevin Millwood will pitch for the Indians on Friday.</p>
        <p>Hafner's home run was his 33rd, and it gave him 108 runs batted in. Ronnie Belliard also hit a two-run homer for the Indians in the first inning. Jhonny Peralta hit a solo home run in the third.</p>
