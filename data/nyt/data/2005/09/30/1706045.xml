        <p>Somehow, he managed to sleep at night. But in the three feverish weeks he catered to the needs of hurricane victims, Refael Eizraelov never really got a break.</p>
        <p>''Everything you do during the days, it's still alive during your dreams,'' said Mr. Eizraelov, a 28-year-old native of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Finally, after two hurricanes and volunteer work in two cities, he rested this week.</p>
        <p>''I feel very good,'' he said Tuesday by telephone from his home, the Austin apartment he shares with his wife, who was raised in Texas. ''Today was the first day in which I woke up, called friends in Israel, checked e-mails.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizraelov, who is unemployed and waiting to get his green card, drove to Houston a few days after Hurricane Katrina to help the bedraggled arrivals from New Orleans.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning, I was serving food in the Astrodome, sorting piles of clothing and shoes, things people donate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His mother-in-law, Dr. Mary Gasal, an obstetrician-gynecologist, assisted in the triage area, he said, and Mr. Eizraelov became a ''runner,'' shepherding the sick to doctors gathered inside the stadium.</p>
        <p>''I carried a few babies with fever,'' he said in a thick accent. ''You can feel them when you carry them. They were very hot and dizzy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizraelov is used to challenges. He served in the Israeli Army, and cared for his ill mother before her death from cancer three years ago; his father, he says, was abusive and dealt drugs.</p>
        <p>''You learn in the Israeli Army that there are situations you need to solve,'' he said. ''There's nothing that's hard or easy. It depends on how much you're willing to do.''</p>
        <p>After a few days in Houston, Mr. Eizraelov decided to work closer to home, with the American Red Cross at the Austin Convention Center. Several hundred evacuees with special needs -- those in wheelchairs, the blind, the elderly and some with mental illnesses -- had to be identified, tracked and checked every half-hour, said Mr. Eizraelov, who headed the operation.</p>
        <p>He would start at 7 a.m. and get home after 10 p.m., exhausted.</p>
        <p>''I would be watching 'The Daily Show,''' he said, ''and that's when my eyes would turn off.''</p>
        <p>His wife, Sarah Mogab, would drag him to bed, a process he described by using the Hebrew verb ''legared.'' His translation: ''To scrape something off the floor.''</p>
        <p>Last weekend Mr. Eizraelov turned to helping evacuees from Hurricane Rita. But he took a break at several points to accompany his wife and mother-in-law to the Austin City Limits Music Festival.</p>
        <p>''That's something I cannot say no to,'' he said sheepishly. ''If you're going to say no, it's a family incident.''</p>
