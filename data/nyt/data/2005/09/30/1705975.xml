        <p>Neil Genzlinger reviews musical The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World, book by Joy Gregory, music by Gunnar Madsen and lyrics by Madsen and Gregory, part of New York Musical Theater Festival (M)</p>

        <p>There's good news for anyone who accidentally stumbled into a pop-ploitation musical like ''Good Vibrations'' or ''All Shook Up'' and has been feeling sugar-saturated ever since: an antidote is available at the Samuel Beckett Theater. It's called ''The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World,'' and watching it is much like listening to songs by the real Shaggs: unsettling, disturbing, challenging, even a little awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>The Shaggs were a trio of sisters in New Hampshire -- Dot, Betty and Helen Wiggin -- whose father, at least as portrayed here, more or less ordered them to form a rock band in the late 1960's, hoping it would be his ticket out of the millworker life. The girls were not blessed with natural musical talent -- their songs sound like under-rehearsed Roches; some are almost painful to listen to. But their father, Austin (compellingly played here by Peter Friedman), seems to have heard only the good notes.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="online_lead_paragraph">
        <p>"The Shaggs" is not only a biographical look at a 60's curiosity, but also a jolting portrait of a man's desire to escape ordinariness.</p>

        <p>There's good news for anyone who accidentally stumbled into a pop-ploitation musical like ''Good Vibrations'' or ''All Shook Up'' and has been feeling sugar-saturated ever since: an antidote is available at the Samuel Beckett Theater. It's called ''The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World,'' and watching it is much like listening to songs by the real Shaggs: unsettling, disturbing, challenging, even a little awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>The Shaggs were a trio of sisters in New Hampshire -- Dot, Betty and Helen Wiggin -- whose father, at least as portrayed here, more or less ordered them to form a rock band in the late 1960's, hoping it would be his ticket out of the millworker life. The girls were not blessed with natural musical talent -- their songs sound like under-rehearsed Roches; some are almost painful to listen to. But their father, Austin (compellingly played here by Peter Friedman), seems to have heard only the good notes.</p>
        <p>He sunk the family savings into the band and the recording, in 1969, of an album called ''Philosophy of the World,'' not realizing that he was being fleeced by the producer. A decade later, though, the album resurfaced, its punk/garage-band/nihilistic sound suddenly registering, with some, as alternative-rock genius. A cult following resulted.</p>
        <p>''The Shaggs,'' part of the New York Musical Theater Festival, tells this story fearlessly and with the same disregard for the conventions of musical theater that the Shaggs had for the conventions of pop music. The show doesn't use the Shaggs' songs, though we hear pieces of them; its music is by the versatile Gunnar Madsen, with lyrics by him and the book writer, Joy Gregory. Their unpredictable concoction is sometimes funny, but just as often grim; a song late in the play called ''Driving Home (The Rage),'' with the now-fractured Wiggin family together in a car, is downright scary.</p>
        <p>Making it all work are the actresses playing the sisters: Jamey Hood as the cheery Dot, Amy Eschman as the brooding Betty and Dana Acheson as the silent Helen. Among other things, they achieve the deceptively difficult feat of sounding like the world's worst rock trio at some points, but blending beautifully at others, as we hear the band the way Austin imagined it sounded.</p>
        <p>''The Shaggs'' ends up being not merely a biographical look at a 60's curiosity, but also a jolting portrait of a man's desire to escape ordinariness, and of his daughters' desire to return to it. ''Trash should die,'' Betty says early in the play, talking about plastic-foam coffee cups, but perhaps really referring to the Shaggs' music. ''You should burn it and bury it and never think about it again.'' Not really, because sometimes yesterday's trash can provide today's insights.</p>
        <p>''The Shaggs: Philosophy of the World'' continues through Sunday at the Samuel Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)352-3101.</p>
