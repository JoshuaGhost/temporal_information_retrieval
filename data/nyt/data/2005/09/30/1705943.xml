        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'COLDER THAN HERE' Judith Light plays a British wife and mother slowly succumbing to cancer but resisting low spirits to the last in Laura Wade's skillful but unexceptional play. Brian Murray, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe cope as best they can, admiring Mom's brave spirit as they heal the rifts that separate them (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DR. SEX' This harmless, fluffy musical about the life of Alfred Kinsey imagines the groundbreaking scientist and sex researcher as a good-time guy who likes to fool around at gay clubs and crack wise like a Catskills comic. As played by the very game Brian Noonan, Kinsey strips at a moment's notice, dances in front of a Busby Berkeley line of Kinsey Players and boils down his philosophy, quite deftly, actually, into ''When you're making whoop, you're part of a group'' (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'FRAN'S BED' Even the ever-radiant charms of Mia Farrow are not enough to dispel the pervasive gloom in this wan new play, written and directed by James Lapine, about an American family facing an unhappy ending. Ms. Farrow plays a comatose woman surveying, in her apparently still-active mind, an unhappy life. Intermittently fun, but mostly glum (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcees, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>*'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'MOTHER COURAGE' An effort more commendable for its intention than its execution, this staging fails to capture either the tragedy or the comedy of the play, let alone the ironies of war (2:45). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton)</p>
        <p>'NO FOREiGNERS BEYOND THIS POINT' Two innocents abroad learn the limits of American idealism in Warren Leight's wistfully funny new play about the difficulty of doing good in a society rigged to accommodate only more cynical transactions. Based on Mr. Leight's own experience as a teacher of English in China before he established a career as a playwright (the Tony-winning ''Side Man''), the play is slight but appealing (2:00). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Jennifer Mudge, as the girl he abandoned, is poignantly hopeless. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'SPIRIT' Three men and one slippery slope of a stage. From these simple elements, the inspired London-based Improbable troupe maps a funny, melancholy and altogether entrancing journey into a land of dreams, warfare and actorly neurosis. A magical demonstration that theater can go places that no other art form can. (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalogue, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE SAUNDERS'S PASTORALIA' An often funny if ultimately disappointing stage adaptation of George Saunders's brilliantly entertaining and brazenly off-kilter novella about a financially strapped, historically themed amusement park featuring everything from fake hermits to a simulated Jesus. The director Yehuda Duenyas faithfully adapts the chilling satire, but never figures out a theatrical way to articulate the inner life of its characters(1:25). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE SAFETY NET' Christopher Kyle's thoughtful midlife-crisis drama touches on everything from the racial prejudices of the liberal elite to the nature-nurture debate in this finely tuned production about a man going through the motions. David, an immigration lawyer very close to making partner, has a very late coming of age after his brother dies in a car accident, leaving a pregnant fiancée (2:00). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, sixth floor, Clinton, (212)397-2918. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'COUCHWORKS' On a set featuring a beat-up couch, this lively collection of one-acts by playwrights like Adam Rapp and Theresa Rebeck has the feel of a party thrown by the cool kids of downtown theater. By far the most fully realized play is ''Music for a High Ceiling,'' in which a potentially dry subject -- the history of the theremin and the trumpet -- is staged with panache (1:30). The Tank at Chashama, 208 West 37th Street, (212)868-4444, closing Tuesday.(Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tonight. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>*'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CHAIN' (No rating, 99 minutes) Jem Cohen's sad, lyrical evocation of the homogeneity of the global landscape views it through the eyes of two young women: a Japanese corporate functionary researching theme parks in the United States and a glum temp worker eking out a living in shopping malls and motels. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)</p>
        <p>*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)</p>
        <p>*'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)</p>
        <p>*'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'OCCUPATION: DREAMLAND' (No rating, 79 minutes) In early 2004, eight members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division allowed the directors Ian Olds and Garrett Scott to shadow them for six weeks in a rapidly destabilizing Fallujah. The resulting film is a respectful and determinedly nonpartisan portrait of regular guys -- the smart and the average, the blusterers and the introverts, the gung-ho and the conflicted -- all doing their best to carry out orders in an untenable situation. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'PROOF' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A terribly serious adaptation of David Auburn's prize-laden Broadway play, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter of a dead mathematician struggling to come to terms with both her father's legacy and her own troubled mind. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THUMBSUCKER' (R, 96 minutes) A better-than-usual coming-of-age story, via Sundance but without the usual sensationalism or condescension, and with some very fine performances, notably by Lou Pucci as a teenage boy with a childish habit. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)</p>

        <p>ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, DR. DOG (Monday) With its hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. The shaggy Philly lo-fi rockers Dr. Dog open. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505; $12.50.(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BECK (Thursday) Back to retro-ironic rock form after a while spent making sincere anti-folk music, the self-aware soulman Beck Hanson aims to reclaim his mid-90's role as pop's forward- and backward-looking prince of pastiche. 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740; $42. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BRASS BAND BENEFIT FOR NEW ORLEANS (Sunday) A group of brass bands, including McCollough Sons of Thunder, the Hungry March Band, Jambalaya Brass Band, Slavic Soul Party!, Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band and Frank London's Klezmer Brass Allstars, convene for this Hurricane Katrina benefit show, with a theme of music from New Orleans, the birthplace of the form. 7 p.m., Jan Hus Church, 351 East 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-6743; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN BUTLER TRIO (Tonight) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 7:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>CAPLETON (Monday) With his machine-gun flow, the dancehall veteran Capleton denounces the hell of corruption he finds all around him. He also has softer romantic and spiritual sides, but it's tough to imagine him letting his guard down. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GEORGE CLINTON &amp; PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8, , Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)531-5305;$40 to $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE DECEMBERISTS (Tuesday) Colin Melloy's songs about child queens, heartsick spies and vengeful seafarers duking it out inside a whale hold up well alongside his love songs, so formally sturdy that even when bittersweet they seem to have hope mixed into their mortar. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>EAST VILLAGE OPERA COMPANY (Wednesday and Thursday) The Canadians Peter Kiesewalter and Tyley Ross blend opera and rock to form something that is decidedly not rock opera. The band includes a string section and performs classical arias like ''La donna é mobile'' and ''Ave Maria,'' adding electronic percussion, guitar solos and flamboyant 80's keyboard antics. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ELECTRIC SIX, MORNINGWOOD (Tonight) Detroit's Electric Six plays manic garage rock that surges with disco-punk. Dick Valentine can howl with the best of them, but it remains to be seen whether lineup changes will affect the high energy level. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ROBERT FRIPP, PORCUPINE TREE (Tomorrow) Mr. Fripp, the King Crimson guitarist, is the inventor of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics.'' Porcupine Tree's melodic psychedelic prog rock has a metallic edge. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100; $32.50 (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BEBEL GILBERTO (Tonight through Sunday night) Bebel Gilberto, the daughter of the bossa nova singer João Gilberto, updates bossa nova with touches of electronics and substitutes her own ebullience for her father's preternatural coolness. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30 (sold out). (Pareles)</p>
        <p>DAVID GRAY (Wednesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)247-4777,; $29.50 to $54.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>HEARTLESS BASTARDS, WE ARE WOLVES (Tonight) Because of her primal yowl, the southern Ohio singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The Montreal trio We Are Wolves opens. At 9, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE HOLD STEADY, THE ORANGES BAND (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady frontman Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The pleasantly droney pop rockers the Oranges Band open. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>INTERPOL (Sunday) The dashing dark suits and dirgy post-punk rock of Interpol verges on haute Goth. But despite resonant baritone vocals that conjure Joy Division gloom, it is a groovy pop band at heart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $31. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NORAH JONES (Thursday) Norah Jones's voice may seem hesitant, yet on two hugely popular albums, she has quietly defined an adult pop that's touched by jazz, folk and country but beholden to none of them. She plays here at the T.J. Martell cancer research organization's Humanitarian Awards Gala. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, in the Marriott Marquis Hotel, (212)833-5444; $1,000. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE KILLERS, BRITISH SEA POWER (Tonight) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers's glam goof charisma or maybe it's their nostalgic preference for 80's MTV. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. British Sea Power puts a dreamy spin on dark new wave with its insistent baritone vocals and bright guitar lines. At 6:30, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $35. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN MAYER TRIO, CHARLIE SEXTON (Thursday) Along with his songwriting chops, the sloe-eyed singer and guitarist John Mayer brings to the folk-rock sphere a winsome combination of earnest, sexy questing and easygoing humor. Charlie Sexton made his first record at 16, when he was hailed as a sort of new-wave roots rocker. Since then, he's played with Bob Dylan and produced for Lucinda Williams, and this year is preparing to tour with John Mayer. His own songs increasingly tend toward personal alt-country. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070; $45.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>O.A.R. (Monday) This jam band plays the sax and guitar reggae-inflected rock beloved by fans of the Dave Matthews Band. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $35. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>PAUL MCCARTNEY (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) The ex-Beatle and former leader of Wings offers nostalgia to baby-boomers and graceful tunes and tidings of love to everyone else, in a voice that's perpetually guileless. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50 to $279.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>METRIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Hanes, this band finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Hanes's shuddering alto functions alternately as a weapon and a whip-cracking come-on. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. Thursday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NADA SURF (Thursday) These Brooklyn alt-rockers tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's MTV hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with the lovingly ''Let Go'' (Barsuk), which squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE RAVEONETTES (Tuesday) Clearing away the garage noise of their debut, this Danish duo now strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Their latest material incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. At 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Tonight ) Salsa singers, or soneros, have borrowed a few ideas from Latin pop in recent years, ordering arrangements that are detailed for the radio as well as the dance floor. One of the most dynamic salsa performers is the trumpet-voiced, improvisatory singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, who holds on to the fundamentals: brassy, hard-swinging declamations of love songs and soaring improvisations traded with the band. 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $55 to $130. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Social Distortion came out of the Southern California punk explosion of the late 1970's and stuck around. By now, its buzzsaw chords and minor-key melodies have taken on a tinge of roots rock, and Mike Ness has moved from singing about youthful frustrations to pondering adult choices and consequences. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $29. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>TLEN-HUICANI (Sunday) The harpist Alberto de la Rosa leads this Mexican folk group, whose name means ''the singers.'' Its members play music specific to Veracruz -- from the lolling huasteco to the more rapid Southern jarocho -- as well as other Latin American styles. 7 p.m., Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ARMIN VAN BUUREN (Tonight) Though the Dutch trance DJ and producer Armin Van Buuren tends toward instrumentals and atmospherics, he never forgets his main duty: keeping those bodies moving, Ibiza-style. The extended set is a specialty. Doors open at 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000; $30 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ZAP MAMA (Tuesday) This Afro-Belgian vocal group has grown ever more experimental through the years; its latest internationalist forays have moved into the realm of the remix, collaborating with programmer-producers. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940;$23. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Tuesday through Oct. 16) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>*TRIBUTE TO STEVE LACY (Thursday) Lacy, who died last year, is properly remembered as one of the finest soprano saxophonists of all time; what's somewhat less heralded is his compositional acumen. This concert addresses that oversight by enlisting Mr. Lacy's peers and inheritors -- like the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the saxophonists David Liebman and Joe Lovano, and the clarinetist Don Byron -- to interpret his works. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212)501-3330; $10.

        <p>MARK MURPHY (Tonight and tomorrow) The cool and commanding Mr. Murphy has been a musician's singer since the mid-1950's; his wiseacre quips occasionally give way to New Age platitudes these days, but the phrasing and vocal control are still intact. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

        <p>*PHAROAH SANDERS QUARTET (Wednesday through Oct. 9) Mr. Sanders, one of the most significant survivors of 1960's free jazz, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest; he has worthy acolytes in the pianist William Henderson, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Adam Cruz. 8 and 10 p.m. (with an 11:30 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays and an 8:45 p.m. start for the early show on Saturday), Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $27.50 to $32.50, with a $10 minimum.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Puccini's most popular opera has returned to the Metropolitan Opera in Franco Zeffirelli's audience-pleasing production. Hei-Kyung Hong shines brightly in the role of Mimì, and Roberto Aronica is an ardent and vocally respectable Rodolfo. Philippe Auguin keeps things tastefully on track in the pit. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $42 to $320. A pre-performance lecture takes place at 11:30 a.m. in the Kaplan Penthouse, $14. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Thursday) The Belgrade-born mezzo-soprano Milena Kitic, a star of the Yugoslavia Opera in her hometown, makes her Metropolitan Opera debut as Bizet's Carmen, a role she has performed to acclaim throughout Europe. With the golden-voiced Ruth Ann Swenson as Micaela, the powerful tenor Marco Berti as Don José and the insightful conductor Philippe Jordan on the podium, there seem good reasons to revisit Franco Zeffirelli's overdone production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterful James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel. He is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe, as Mistress Quickly, who almost steals the show. Go see it. Tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $42 to $320. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's Japanese classic is one of City Opera's best. And there's a lot else to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto to Jake Gardner's Sharpless. Furthermore, Shu-Ying Lee, who was magnificent in the title role when the Dicapo Opera presented all three versions of the opera last year, has taken it over here. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $120. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MANON' (Tonight and Monday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production of Massenet's tragedy, absent from the Metropolitan Opera since 2001, returns with Renée Fleming as the conflicted Manon and Marcelo Álvarez as a passionate, and unusually well-rounded des Grieux. Both are in fine voice and have the support of a well-balanced cast, as well as vibrant conducting by Jésus López-Cobos. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $36 to $320 tonight, $26 to $320 on Monday. (Allan Kozinn)</p>

        <p>'PATIENCE' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) City Opera's fast-moving, juiced-up version of ''Patience'' offers Gilbert and Sullivan's comic screed against aesthetic and intellectual presumption. A little over the top, but Michael Ball and Kevin Burdette save the evening. 8 p.m. tonight, 1:30 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $120. (Holland)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30, $25 for 65+, students with ID, and children. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS'  (Tomorrow and Tuesday) This is a delightful piece of comic froth, written by Rossini as an occasional piece, featuring a dozen soloists, in honor of the new French king. But if you're going to stage a piece that consists of nothing but star turns and virtuosic singing, it would help to have virtuosos or stars. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., City Opera, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; remaining tickets: $45 to $95 tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday.(Midgette)</p>

Oestreich)</p>
        <p>'LORENZO DA PONTE: A BRIDGE FROM ITALY TO NEW YORK' (Wednesday) Even die-hard Mozart fans may not realize that Lorenzo Da Ponte, the composer's librettist for ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' emigrated to America in 1805 and, among other odd jobs, taught Italian language and literature at Columbia University. As the first event in a series of concerts and programs marking the 200th anniversary of Da Ponte's arrival, Columbia's Italian Academy presents the mezzo-soprano Krista River in a program of songs with texts by Da Ponte. Composers include Mozart, of course, but also Donaudy, Bellini, Verdi and Storace. 8 p.m., Italian Academy, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue at 118th Street, Manhattan, (212)854-1623; $12; students and seniors, $5. (Eichler).</p>
        <p>'EAST MEETS WEST' (Tomorrow) The excellent violinist Daniel Hope is often heard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art performing standard repertory as a member of the Beaux Arts Trio, but here he opens the Met's season on a much more eclectic note. The program features arrangements of familiar works like Ravel's ''Tzigane'' contrasted with Asian-tinged music and Indian ragas, for which Mr. Hope will be accompanied by Shyam Mohan on tabla and Gaurav Mazumdar on sitar. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $40. (Eichler)</p>

        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) In the last three years Lorin Maazel has started the subscription seasons of the New York Philharmonic with the premiere of a commissioned work. This season is beginning more conventionally. The orchestra has commenced its overly hyped ''Elliott Carter Focus'' with the composer's early Holiday Overture, though the Mozart Concerto in A, K. 488 (with Jonathan Biss as soloist) and two scores by Strauss form the substance of the program (repeated today and tomorrow). On Wednesday night Charles Dutoit takes the podium to lead the Philharmonic in works by Ravel, Prokofiev (excerpts from ''Romeo and Juliet'') and Dvorak's Violin Concerto with the always rewarding violinist Sarah Chang. Maazel program: today at 2 p.m. and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Dutoit program: Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ORION' (Tuesday and Thursday) In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world. This performance includes Mark Atkins on didgeridoo, Wu Man on pipa, Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle and others. 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene (718)636-4100; $20 to $60. (Oestreich)</p>
        <p>MAKI NAMEKAWA AND DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES (Thursday) Though best known as a conductor, Dennis Russell Davies has a formidable keyboard technique that will be evident in this collaboration with Maki Namekawa, a young pianist who, like Mr. Davies, has a reputation as an eloquent new music player. Their program includes Messiaen's otherworldly ''Visions de l'Amen'' and works by Gyorgy Kurtag, Shoko Shida and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799; $25.

        <p>THE DANCE 4U PROJECT (Sunday) Germaul Barnes, a Bill T. Jones alumnus, founded this new company to preserve important dances by black male choreographers. The program, presented as part of the 92nd Street Y's informal Sundays @ Three series, includes Eleo Pomare's seldom-performed 1972 ''Phoenix Rising''; Leni Wylliams's ''Sweet in the Morning''; an excerpt from Mr. Jones's ''Ballad''; and work by Mr. Barnes.

        <p>RICHARD DANIELS (Tonight through Sunday night) Apparently, these days even the immortals grow old. Mr. Daniels reimagines Stravinsky's ''Apollo &amp; the Muses'' with two gods, one youthful, one older. In ''Telling Tales,'' this choreographer collaborated with various partners to produce a dance diary. The pianist Nurit Tilles accompanies throughout.

        <p>*JEANINE DURNING (Tonight and tomorrow night) Always thought-provoking and frequently exciting, Ms. Durning departs from her recent driven pure-dance choreography for a new work that explores confinement, complete with bound women and men in suits. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; $12 for students and artists.

        <p>DARIA FAIN (Thursday through Saturday) Ms. Fain's new work, ''Germ,'' is about how things form. Part rite of spring, part poetry, the piece is a collaboration with the poet and architect Robert Kocik, the composer Kenta Nagai, the visual artist Catarina Verde and the lighting designer Thomas Dunn. 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)482-7069 or www.chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>*FALL FOR DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) The final three nights of the second annual installment of City Center's wildly successful dance showcase, offering five diverse companies or artists per night for $10 a ticket. What makes this series unusual is the high profile of so many of the companies involved, and the range of dance styles on display. Tonight's program, for instance, offers Molissa Fenley, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Tapage, the New York City Ballet and the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater. Tomorrow's presentation has, among others, les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal, the Brenda Angiel Aerial Dance Company from Buenos Aires and the Paul Taylor Dance Company. Sunday's final program includes Vincent Mantsoe from South Africa, the Compagnie Marie Chouinard and the Joffrey Ballet. At 8, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>JORDAN FUCHS (Thursday through Oct. 9) Mr. Fuchs shrinks the stage space by drawing the audience seating into it, and gives his dancers plenty of opportunities to appear and disappear in his new ''Almost and the Nearly.'' Thursday through Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Oct. 9 at 7:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 134 East 10th Street, East Village, (212)674-8194; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>YOKO HIGASHINO &amp; HIROAKI UMEDA (Thursday through Saturday) Two Japanese choreographers present post-Murakami explorations of the urban, pop-culture landscape of contemporary Japan. Last year, Higashino's ''Alarm! -- zero hour edition'' won the Toyota Choreography Award in Japan. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)212-924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 to $20. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>HUMAN FUTURE DANCE CORPS (Tonight and tomorrow) ''No Change'' or ''freedom is a psycho-kinetic skill'' might be worth it for the name alone. The Bessie Award-winning choreographer DD Dorvillier collaborated with artists in several countries to create this solo. The ''nomadic'' process led her to this industrial recording studio in Brooklyn. 8:30 p.m., Context Studios, 1 North 12th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (212)674-8194, www.contextnyc.com; $12 (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>JUILLIARD DANCE ENSEMBLE (Tonight through Sunday) Eliot Feld's new ''Sir Isaac's Apples,'' set to Steve Reich's ''Drumming'' performed live, is billed as another of Mr. Feld's ''ramp dances.'' The vision of these young dancers tumbling down like ripe Deliciouses is entrancing. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and Sunday at 3 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)769-7406; $20; students and 65+, $10; T.D.F. accepted. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>NOEMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA' (Tonight and tomorrow night) An abandoned, perhaps too huge, old city pool is the latest setting for Ms. Lafrance's imaginative site-specific explorations. At 8, McCarren Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)302-5024 or www.sensproduction.org; $25 and $40; students and 65+, $18; children under 12 with an adult, $7. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>'MAKING MUSIC VISIBLE: SYMPHONIC EURYTHMY TOUR 2005' (Wednesday) Earnest people in multihued veils and drapes enacting live music, including Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony. Part of a 16-city North American tour by disciples of Rudolf Steiner and his version of eurythmics. 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212)581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $40 to $85.(Rockwell)</p>
        <p>JENNIFER MULLER/THE WORKS (Tonight through Sunday) The company celebrates 30 years with ''Essentially Muller,'' presenting classics like ''The Spotted Owls'' and the recent ''Flowers,'' as well as several premieres. Tuesday gala at 7 p.m.; Wednesday through Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800; $42. (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>KO MUROBUSHI &amp; EDGE (Thursday through Saturday) Mr. Murobushi, a disciple of the Butoh pioneer Tatsumi Hijikata, continues his master's dark legacy with a piece oddly redolent of spring, ''Handsome Blue Sky (Bibo No Aozora).'' 7:30 p.m., the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)752-3015, www.japansociety.org; $35. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>*'WATCHING LIGETI MOVE: THREE BALLETS BY CHRISTOPhER WHEELDON' (Tonight and tomorrow night) To inaugurate its season and a festival devoted to the music of Gyorgy Ligeti, the Miller Theater presents dancers from the New York City Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet in three works choreographed by Mr. Wheeldon to Mr. Ligeti's music and never before presented on one program. At 8, Miller Theater, Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799 or www.millertheatre.com. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>KRIOTA WILLBERG/DURA MATER (Tonight, and tomorrow and Thursday nights) In her new multimedia ''Bentfootes,'' Ms. Willberg tells the story of 200 years of dance by the downtown choreographer Susan Bentfoote and her family. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, East Village, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org; $10 to $15; T.D.F. accepted on Thursday. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>Art</p>
        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic ''outsider'' category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia itself, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his own work artifacts that he has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossil stones to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the trylon and perisphere (a mini-sculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>*Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ARNO RAFAEL MINKKINEN: 'VINTAGE PHOTOGRAPHS, 1970-1980' Since the early 1970's, this Finnish-born photographer has been shooting parts of his nude body, mostly in conjunction with natural sites, his obsession leavened by humor. In one photograph his long, bony leg dangles disembodiedly over the stern of a broad-bottomed rowboat against a backdrop of lake, sky and firs; in another the soles of his feet appear magically in the branches of a tree, shot from below, the broad distortion of the feet concealing the body attached to them. Mr. Minkkinen's interest in the interaction of the nude body and the environment suggests the kind of ethereality that earthlings have always longed for. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)262-5050, through Oct. 8. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Henry Wolf Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the extraordinarily suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's own noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DENNIS ADAMS: 'MAKE DOWN' This brainy political artist presents a video in which he uses film stills from the movie ''Battle of Algiers'' to wipe dark green makeup off his face and body. It's about terrorism, gender, masking and unmasking. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ANN AGEE: 'BOXING IN THE KITCHEN' A ceramicist with a playful and not too fussy touch, Ms. Agee has created a whimsical, tabletop landscape in which painted terra-cotta representations of friends and family members in different sorts of costumes cavort among cartoonish pink rock formations. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212)647-1044, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*'Autonomy' Five promising young artists -- Melanie Schiff, Stephen G. Rhodes, Brett Lund, Nathan Hylden and Aaron Curry -- give modernism funk lessons at one of Chelsea's smartest and tiniest galleries. Sol Lewitt and Alexander Calder meet striped bikinis and rubber chickens. And, as in several other shows of late, sculpture, as a medium, is looking like an excellent idea. Foxy Production, 547 West 27th Street, No.6, (212)239-2758, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>LAURA BATTLE Mathematically patterned spots and dots combine with fields of loose painterly abstraction in Ms. Battle's cosmically suggestive paintings and watercolors. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212)727-8304, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ADAM CVIJANOVIC: 'LOVE POEM (TEN MINUTES AFTER THE END OF GRAVITY)' With a deft, representational touch, Mr. Cvijanovic has painted an expansive, airy mural depicting what could be a scene in a Spielberg movie: a Los Angeles suburb that appears to have been violently uprooted and elevated into the sky. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)929-5959, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Dialogue: Baldessari, Prince, Ruscha, Wool' Four paintings based on words make for a fine four-way conversation in yet another new micro-gallery. They include a funny-joke painting by Richard Prince, a menacing double-entendre by Christopher Wool, an art-about-art paradox by John Baldessari and an illusory farewell by Ed Ruscha. Perry Rubenstein, 534 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'I'M A CHILD OF DIVORCE GIMME A BREAK' The clear leader for best title of the moment. This exhibition, featuring media-saturated collages and sculptures by Michael St. John, and single works by 10 others, is worth a visit, too. Highlights include a sweet, glossy cartoon painting of a hippopotamus by Adrian Ting; a tenderly painted portrait of a cherubic demon by Elizabeth Olbert; a painterly Pop-style picture of a Bromo Seltzer bottle from 1984 by Walter Robinson; and aggressively physical abstract paintings by Suzanne McClelland, Gary Stephan and Josh Smith. Cynthia Broan, 546 West 29th Street, (212)760-0809, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>LAURA LARSON: 'APPARITION' For mysterious reasons, a lot of people these days are interested in photography of the supernatural. Ms. Larson creates rich color photographs of forest interiors and rooms in an abandoned psychiatric asylum in which wisps of smoke or mist suggest spiritual presences. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, (212)941-0012, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Barry Le Va: '9g-Wagner: Variation II' A large work that was featured in Mr. Le Va's recent retrospective at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia inaugurates this gallery's new home in Chelsea. A severe yet playful arrangement of panels on the wall and variously shaped black boxes and cylinders on the floor, the installation evokes associations with early Modernist abstraction, Minimalism and hip department store décor. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212)223-2227, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MUD' This exceptional four-artist show of small sculpture features lively, insouciant ceramics by the painter Joanne Greenbaum; crusty, off-white ceramics by Elliott Levine that look like ancient artifacts; cartoonish sculptures about modern machines by Aga Ousseinov; and rough, semiabstract sculptures in Styrofoam and papier mâché, alluding to landscapes and furniture, by Yuh-Shioh Wong. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ORLAN/BRIAN BELOTT Orlan, the French performance artist, turns from surgical to digital alterations of her features, which she merges with Pre-Columbian artifacts. Mr. Belott pursues more low-tech methods in painted collages, handmade books and a touching slide show of images from other people's lives. Stefan Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212)352-1600, through Oct. 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>PALOMA VARGA WEISZ: 'CHOR' In a demure New York debut dominated by carved limewood busts, this German artist attempts to vivify a late-Gothic figurative style with intimations of Minimalism, Conceptualism and Surrealism. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Oct. 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>*'Pop Politics Power' In this measured but intense three-artist show, Martha Rosler offers a continuation of her 1967-72 photomontage series ''Bringing the War Home''; Carolee Schneemann is represented by both a new film and by her mesmerizing 1965 ''Viet Flakes,'' in which a rush of grainy black-and-white war photographs looks like smoke billowing from a volcano; and Robert Boyd introduces two spooky videos about doomsday religious cults, past, present and (probably) future. LMAKprojects, 526 West 26th Street, No.310, (212)255-9707, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's famous diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis, even if her current applications are similar to the work of Andrew Lord and Beverly Semmes. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Oct. 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Bill Rice: 'The View from 13 East 3rd' This small show is a chance to catch up with some of this pioneering New York artist's paintings and collages from the 1960's onward. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, second floor, (212)242-6242 , through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>*JIM ISERMANN A California-based pioneer of art about design, Mr. Isermann here presents a single, long, wraparound wall made of white plastic diamond-shaped modules. It is a canny conflation of Minimalism, Pop and Op Art with subtly thrilling visual effects. Deitch, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)343-7300, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>OHAD MEROMI: 'CYCLOPS' The jarring mixtures of mediums, narratives and genres in the video and installation work of this young Israel-born artist need more focus and entertainment value, but they smartly see that the field of set-up video is relatively open right now, with plenty of room for worlds to collide. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, South Village, (212)206-1290, through Oct. 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'PAPER MUSEUMS: THE REPRODUCTIVE PRINT IN EUROPE, 1500-1800' From the early 16th century to the beginning of the 19th, prints that reproduced the original work of artists were the only means of acquainting a broad public with the creative endeavors of Dürer, Raphael, Rubens, Michelangelo and the like. This show displays the variety and vitality of such reproductive prints, and points up how they effectively circulated artists' works and ideas in Europe. Don't expect lots of pictorial splash here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Debra Priestly: 'somewhere listening' Ms. Priestly's poetic meditation on ancestry and history consists of life-size charcoal portraits of her own grandparents and six other heroic 19th-century figures of African-American and Indian descent, accompanied by the sounds of old family audio recordings emanating from a set of soup tureens. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, SoHo, (212)226-1660, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>*PHILIP JONES GRIFFITHS For half a century, this documentary photographer has been placing himself squarely in harm's way to record military violence. His pictures of the American war in Vietnam, which make up a substantial part of this show, amount to one of the great tragic portraits of their time, and are required viewing in ours. Denise Bibro Fine Art Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fourth floor, (212)647-7030, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>

It stars Allie Mulholland in the angst-ridden role made famous by James Dean (2:00). Lion Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.</p>
        <p>'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' Opens Oct. 18. The latest production of this comedy by the unstoppably prolific Alan Ayckbourn is about three couples and takes place over three holiday seasons (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'FIVE COURSE LOVE' Previews start tomorrow. Opens Oct. 16. On the menu are five dates in five restaurants, put to music in five different styles, including operetta and country western (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100.</p>
        <p>'IN MY LIFE' Previews start today. Opens Oct. 20. Love blossoms between a musician with Tourette's syndrome and an insecure journalist in this Broadway musical, directed and written by Joseph Brooks (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Nov. 6. Straight from La Jolla Playhouse in California, this rags-to-riches musical tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons and features hits including ''Big Girls Don't Cry'' and ''Rag Doll.'' Des McAnuff directs (2:30). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Starts performances Tuesday. Opens Oct. 27. A little Neil Simon revival you might have heard of, starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick as Oscar and Felix. Joe Mantello directs (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100.</p>
        <p>'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' Opens Oct. 17. The first major New York revival of Charles Fuller's play about the trial of a black soldier during World War II. With Taye Diggs and James McDaniel (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.</p>
        <p>'SWEENEY TODD' Previews start Monday. Opens Nov. 3. Patti LuPone and Michael Cerveris star in this intimate revival of the Sondheim classic, featuring 10 actors who play their own instruments. It started at the Watermill Theater in England, before moving to West End and Broadway (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>'THIRD' Opens Oct. 24. A professor played by Dianne Wiest accuses a student of plagiarism in Wendy Wasserstein's latest. Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'COLDER THAN HERE' Judith Light plays a British wife and mother slowly succumbing to cancer but resisting low spirits to the last in Laura Wade's skillful but unexceptional play. Brian Murray, Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe cope as best they can, admiring Mom's brave spirit as they heal the rifts that separate them (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DR. SEX' This harmless, fluffy musical about the life of Alfred Kinsey imagines the groundbreaking scientist and sex researcher as a good-time guy who likes to fool around at gay clubs and crack wise like a Catskills comic. As played by the very game Brian Noonan, Kinsey strips at a moment's notice, dances in front of a Busby Berkeley line of Kinsey Players and boils down his philosophy, quite deftly, actually, into ''When you're making whoop, you're part of a group'' (2:20). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'FRAN'S BED' Even the ever-radiant charms of Mia Farrow are not enough to dispel the pervasive gloom in this wan new play, written and directed by James Lapine, about an American family facing an unhappy ending. Ms. Farrow plays a comatose woman surveying, in her apparently still-active mind, an unhappy life. Intermittently fun, but mostly glum (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN OF JENNY CHOW' In Rolin Jones's fanciful comedy, playfully directed by Jackson Gay, a lonely young woman in California embarks on an ambitious science project to help conquer her agoraphobia and trace her origins in China. Brisk, funny and engaging, the play disappoints only in its emphasis on flights of fancy over a nuanced depiction of its heroine's emotional dilemmas (2:10). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR' The Peccadillo Theater Company has revived this 1953 play by Dorothy Parker and Arnaud D'Usseau. A comedy set in an East Side hotel populated by widows and divorcees, it is an unyielding and coruscating portrait of women before feminism, relieved by Parker's dead-on wit. East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.(Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>*'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'MOTHER COURAGE' An effort more commendable for its intention than its execution, this staging fails to capture either the tragedy or the comedy of the play, let alone the ironies of war (2:45). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Wilborn Hampton)</p>
        <p>'NO FOREiGNERS BEYOND THIS POINT' Two innocents abroad learn the limits of American idealism in Warren Leight's wistfully funny new play about the difficulty of doing good in a society rigged to accommodate only more cynical transactions. Based on Mr. Leight's own experience as a teacher of English in China before he established a career as a playwright (the Tony-winning ''Side Man''), the play is slight but appealing (2:00). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Jennifer Mudge, as the girl he abandoned, is poignantly hopeless. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'SPIRIT' Three men and one slippery slope of a stage. From these simple elements, the inspired London-based Improbable troupe maps a funny, melancholy and altogether entrancing journey into a land of dreams, warfare and actorly neurosis. A magical demonstration that theater can go places that no other art form can. (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalogue, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE SAUNDERS'S PASTORALIA' An often funny if ultimately disappointing stage adaptation of George Saunders's brilliantly entertaining and brazenly off-kilter novella about a financially strapped, historically themed amusement park featuring everything from fake hermits to a simulated Jesus. The director Yehuda Duenyas faithfully adapts the chilling satire, but never figures out a theatrical way to articulate the inner life of its characters(1:25). P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>*'POOR THEATER' Part homage and part anatomy, the Wooster Group's warm, witty tribute to the director Jerzy Grotowski and the choreographer William Forsythe demonstrates how imitation can be not just sincere flattery but also a hopeful attempt to crawl into someone else's skin to see how it fits. As identities and their representations morph and blur, this is not always a comfortable activity, but it is often an exhilarating one (1:30). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212)868-4444. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE SAFETY NET' Christopher Kyle's thoughtful midlife-crisis drama touches on everything from the racial prejudices of the liberal elite to the nature-nurture debate in this finely tuned production about a man going through the motions. David, an immigration lawyer very close to making partner, has a very late coming of age after his brother dies in a car accident, leaving a pregnant fiancée (2:00). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, sixth floor, Clinton, (212)397-2918. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'COUCHWORKS' On a set featuring a beat-up couch, this lively collection of one-acts by playwrights like Adam Rapp and Theresa Rebeck has the feel of a party thrown by the cool kids of downtown theater. By far the most fully realized play is ''Music for a High Ceiling,'' in which a potentially dry subject -- the history of the theremin and the trumpet -- is staged with panache (1:30). The Tank at Chashama, 208 West 37th Street, (212)868-4444, closing Tuesday.(Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tonight. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>*'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CHAIN' (No rating, 99 minutes) Jem Cohen's sad, lyrical evocation of the homogeneity of the global landscape views it through the eyes of two young women: a Japanese corporate functionary researching theme parks in the United States and a glum temp worker eking out a living in shopping malls and motels. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel. (Scott)</p>
        <p>*'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE' (PG-13, 114 minutes) If you must see only one demonic-possession courtroom drama this year, wait for the next one. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Holden)</p>
        <p>*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)</p>
        <p>*'KEANE' (R, 93 minutes) A man goes searching for his lost daughter -- or does he? The irony of this very fine film is that while the director Lodge Kerrigan's approach can verge on the entomological, he grants this troubled, difficult character the full measure of his humanity. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LORD OF WAR' (R, 122 minutes) A misfire of a political satire about the international gun market from Andrew Niccol, a filmmaker whose words say no, but whose overworked visual style says lock and load, baby. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>*'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)</p>
        <p>*'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>*'OCCUPATION: DREAMLAND' (No rating, 79 minutes) In early 2004, eight members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division allowed the directors Ian Olds and Garrett Scott to shadow them for six weeks in a rapidly destabilizing Fallujah. The resulting film is a respectful and determinedly nonpartisan portrait of regular guys -- the smart and the average, the blusterers and the introverts, the gung-ho and the conflicted -- all doing their best to carry out orders in an untenable situation. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'PROOF' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A terribly serious adaptation of David Auburn's prize-laden Broadway play, starring Gwyneth Paltrow as the daughter of a dead mathematician struggling to come to terms with both her father's legacy and her own troubled mind. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THUMBSUCKER' (R, 96 minutes) A better-than-usual coming-of-age story, via Sundance but without the usual sensationalism or condescension, and with some very fine performances, notably by Lou Pucci as a teenage boy with a childish habit. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>* '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'AN UNFINISHED LIFE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) This contemporary Western starring Robert Redford, Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman is a solemn, sentimental bore that suffocates in its own predictability and watered-down psychobabble. All three stars recycle stereotypes they've played before. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)</p>

        <p>ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI, DR. DOG (Monday) With its hip choral flourishes, kicky grooves and pep-rally shouts, the quirky collective Architecture in Helsinki makes happy baroque pop. The shaggy Philly lo-fi rockers Dr. Dog open. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505; $12.50.(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BECK (Thursday) Back to retro-ironic rock form after a while spent making sincere anti-folk music, the self-aware soulman Beck Hanson aims to reclaim his mid-90's role as pop's forward- and backward-looking prince of pastiche. 7 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-7740; $42. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BRASS BAND BENEFIT FOR NEW ORLEANS (Sunday) A group of brass bands, including McCollough Sons of Thunder, the Hungry March Band, Jambalaya Brass Band, Slavic Soul Party!, Zlatne Uste Balkan Brass Band and Frank London's Klezmer Brass Allstars, convene for this Hurricane Katrina benefit show, with a theme of music from New Orleans, the birthplace of the form. 7 p.m., Jan Hus Church, 351 East 74th Street, Manhattan, (212)288-6743; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN BUTLER TRIO (Tonight) John Butler is an Australian guitarist who, like Ben Harper, turns thoughtful songs into guitar and slide-guitar excursions. 7:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>CAPLETON (Monday) With his machine-gun flow, the dancehall veteran Capleton denounces the hell of corruption he finds all around him. He also has softer romantic and spiritual sides, but it's tough to imagine him letting his guard down. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GEORGE CLINTON &amp; PARLIAMENT/FUNKADELIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. At 8, , Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)531-5305;$40 to $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE DECEMBERISTS (Tuesday) Colin Melloy's songs about child queens, heartsick spies and vengeful seafarers duking it out inside a whale hold up well alongside his love songs, so formally sturdy that even when bittersweet they seem to have hope mixed into their mortar. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $23 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>EAST VILLAGE OPERA COMPANY (Wednesday and Thursday) The Canadians Peter Kiesewalter and Tyley Ross blend opera and rock to form something that is decidedly not rock opera. The band includes a string section and performs classical arias like ''La donna é mobile'' and ''Ave Maria,'' adding electronic percussion, guitar solos and flamboyant 80's keyboard antics. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8778 or (212)239-6200; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ELECTRIC SIX, MORNINGWOOD (Tonight) Detroit's Electric Six plays manic garage rock that surges with disco-punk. Dick Valentine can howl with the best of them, but it remains to be seen whether lineup changes will affect the high energy level. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ROBERT FRIPP, PORCUPINE TREE (Tomorrow) Mr. Fripp, the King Crimson guitarist, is the inventor of the spacey, droning combination of tape loops called ''Frippertronics.'' Porcupine Tree's melodic psychedelic prog rock has a metallic edge. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100; $32.50 (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BEBEL GILBERTO (Tonight through Sunday night) Bebel Gilberto, the daughter of the bossa nova singer João Gilberto, updates bossa nova with touches of electronics and substitutes her own ebullience for her father's preternatural coolness. At 8 and 10:30, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30 (sold out). (Pareles)</p>
        <p>DAVID GRAY (Wednesday) Mr. Gray's voice has a sharp, nervous quaver that keeps him sounding frayed and unpretty. He sings about tears and flames, seashores and rainy nights, strumming an acoustic guitar over his band's syncopated vamps; he owes a lot to Van Morrison. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)247-4777,; $29.50 to $54.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>HEARTLESS BASTARDS, WE ARE WOLVES (Tonight) Because of her primal yowl, the southern Ohio singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The Montreal trio We Are Wolves opens. At 9, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE HOLD STEADY, THE ORANGES BAND (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady frontman Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The pleasantly droney pop rockers the Oranges Band open. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>INTERPOL (Sunday) The dashing dark suits and dirgy post-punk rock of Interpol verges on haute Goth. But despite resonant baritone vocals that conjure Joy Division gloom, it is a groovy pop band at heart. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $31. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NORAH JONES (Thursday) Norah Jones's voice may seem hesitant, yet on two hugely popular albums, she has quietly defined an adult pop that's touched by jazz, folk and country but beholden to none of them. She plays here at the T.J. Martell cancer research organization's Humanitarian Awards Gala. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, in the Marriott Marquis Hotel, (212)833-5444; $1,000. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE KILLERS, BRITISH SEA POWER (Tonight) Maybe it's their Las Vegas roots, maybe it's the singer Brendan Flowers's glam goof charisma or maybe it's their nostalgic preference for 80's MTV. Whatever the reason, the Killers are the pop smash of the neo-New Wave boomlet. British Sea Power puts a dreamy spin on dark new wave with its insistent baritone vocals and bright guitar lines. At 6:30, Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000; $35. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOHN MAYER TRIO, CHARLIE SEXTON (Thursday) Along with his songwriting chops, the sloe-eyed singer and guitarist John Mayer brings to the folk-rock sphere a winsome combination of earnest, sexy questing and easygoing humor. Charlie Sexton made his first record at 16, when he was hailed as a sort of new-wave roots rocker. Since then, he's played with Bob Dylan and produced for Lucinda Williams, and this year is preparing to tour with John Mayer. His own songs increasingly tend toward personal alt-country. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070; $45.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>O.A.R. (Monday) This jam band plays the sax and guitar reggae-inflected rock beloved by fans of the Dave Matthews Band. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $35. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>PAUL MCCARTNEY (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) The ex-Beatle and former leader of Wings offers nostalgia to baby-boomers and graceful tunes and tidings of love to everyone else, in a voice that's perpetually guileless. At 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50 to $279.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>METRIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Led by the vibrant, articulate singer Emily Hanes, this band finds fresh uses for new-wave brio. Ms. Hanes's shuddering alto functions alternately as a weapon and a whip-cracking come-on. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. Thursday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236; $14. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NADA SURF (Thursday) These Brooklyn alt-rockers tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's MTV hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with the lovingly ''Let Go'' (Barsuk), which squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE RAVEONETTES (Tuesday) Clearing away the garage noise of their debut, this Danish duo now strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Their latest material incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. At 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201)653-1703; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GILBERTO SANTA ROSA (Tonight ) Salsa singers, or soneros, have borrowed a few ideas from Latin pop in recent years, ordering arrangements that are detailed for the radio as well as the dance floor. One of the most dynamic salsa performers is the trumpet-voiced, improvisatory singer Gilberto Santa Rosa, who holds on to the fundamentals: brassy, hard-swinging declamations of love songs and soaring improvisations traded with the band. 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $55 to $130. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SOCIAL DISTORTION (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Social Distortion came out of the Southern California punk explosion of the late 1970's and stuck around. By now, its buzzsaw chords and minor-key melodies have taken on a tinge of roots rock, and Mike Ness has moved from singing about youthful frustrations to pondering adult choices and consequences. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $29. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>TLEN-HUICANI (Sunday) The harpist Alberto de la Rosa leads this Mexican folk group, whose name means ''the singers.'' Its members play music specific to Veracruz -- from the lolling huasteco to the more rapid Southern jarocho -- as well as other Latin American styles. 7 p.m., Peter Norton Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212)864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ARMIN VAN BUUREN (Tonight) Though the Dutch trance DJ and producer Armin Van Buuren tends toward instrumentals and atmospherics, he never forgets his main duty: keeping those bodies moving, Ibiza-style. The extended set is a specialty. Doors open at 10, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212)629-9000; $30 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ZAP MAMA (Tuesday) This Afro-Belgian vocal group has grown ever more experimental through the years; its latest internationalist forays have moved into the realm of the remix, collaborating with programmer-producers. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212)243-4940;$23.

(Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>RON BLAKE QUINTET (Wednesday) ''Sonic Tonic'' (Mack Avenue), Mr. Blake's most recent album, goes deeper than most hybrids of jazz, funk and soul; here the tenor saxophonist leads a group featuring the exploratory pianist Michael Cain. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>REGINA CARTER GROUP (Through Sunday) Ms. Carter is unquestionably one of jazz's top violinists, equally comfortable with burnished romanticism and blazing post-bop. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. (with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night), Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232; cover, $25 to $30.

        <p>BILL CHARLAP TRIO (Tuesday through Oct. 16) Bright and breezy yet unfailingly precise, Mr. Charlap, the pianist, has come to exemplify jazz's modern mainstream. So has his working trio, which keeps a Tin Pan Alley repertory percolating in the present tense. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, south of 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BENOÎT DELBECQ (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Delbecq is a French pianist given to intricate prepared timbres, in the manner of John Cage; as on the gently abstract album ''Nu-Turn'' (Songlines), he performs here in a solo setting. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212)242-1063; cover, $12.

        <p>JOHN ELLIS (Monday) A saxophonist and bass clarinetist, Mr. Ellis spent more than a few formative years in New Orleans, a fact that suffuses his loose-limbed recent album ''One Foot in the Swamp'' (Hyena). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $10 at tables with a $5 minimum, or $5 at the bar with a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>*TRIBUTE TO STEVE LACY (Thursday) Lacy, who died last year, is properly remembered as one of the finest soprano saxophonists of all time; what's somewhat less heralded is his compositional acumen. This concert addresses that oversight by enlisting Mr. Lacy's peers and inheritors -- like the trombonist Roswell Rudd, the saxophonists David Liebman and Joe Lovano, and the clarinetist Don Byron -- to interpret his works. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212)501-3330; $10.

        <p>MARK MURPHY (Tonight and tomorrow) The cool and commanding Mr. Murphy has been a musician's singer since the mid-1950's; his wiseacre quips occasionally give way to New Age platitudes these days, but the phrasing and vocal control are still intact. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Puccini's most popular opera has returned to the Metropolitan Opera in Franco Zeffirelli's audience-pleasing production. Hei-Kyung Hong shines brightly in the role of Mimì, and Roberto Aronica is an ardent and vocally respectable Rodolfo. Philippe Auguin keeps things tastefully on track in the pit. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $42 to $320. A pre-performance lecture takes place at 11:30 a.m. in the Kaplan Penthouse, $14. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Thursday) The Belgrade-born mezzo-soprano Milena Kitic, a star of the Yugoslavia Opera in her hometown, makes her Metropolitan Opera debut as Bizet's Carmen, a role she has performed to acclaim throughout Europe. With the golden-voiced Ruth Ann Swenson as Micaela, the powerful tenor Marco Berti as Don José and the insightful conductor Philippe Jordan on the podium, there seem good reasons to revisit Franco Zeffirelli's overdone production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $320.(Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The attention to detail that characterizes this production is truly unusual: it's well cast, well acted and well conducted by a masterful James Levine. It also features the reigning Falstaff of our day, Bryn Terfel. He is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe, as Mistress Quickly, who almost steals the show. Go see it. Tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $42 to $320. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Tomorrow) Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's Japanese classic is one of City Opera's best. And there's a lot else to like here, from the intermittently good conducting of Ari Pelto to Jake Gardner's Sharpless. Furthermore, Shu-Ying Lee, who was magnificent in the title role when the Dicapo Opera presented all three versions of the opera last year, has taken it over here. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $120. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MANON' (Tonight and Monday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production of Massenet's tragedy, absent from the Metropolitan Opera since 2001, returns with Renée Fleming as the conflicted Manon and Marcelo Álvarez as a passionate, and unusually well-rounded des Grieux. Both are in fine voice and have the support of a well-balanced cast, as well as vibrant conducting by Jésus López-Cobos. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $36 to $320 tonight, $26 to $320 on Monday. (Allan Kozinn)</p>

        <p>'PATIENCE' (Tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) City Opera's fast-moving, juiced-up version of ''Patience'' offers Gilbert and Sullivan's comic screed against aesthetic and intellectual presumption. A little over the top, but Michael Ball and Kevin Burdette save the evening. 8 p.m. tonight, 1:30 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; $16 to $120. (Holland)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, is presenting an even more venerable standby as the first production of its 58th season: Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30, $25 for 65+, students with ID, and children. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'IL VIAGGIO A REIMS'  (Tomorrow and Tuesday) This is a delightful piece of comic froth, written by Rossini as an occasional piece, featuring a dozen soloists, in honor of the new French king. But if you're going to stage a piece that consists of nothing but star turns and virtuosic singing, it would help to have virtuosos or stars. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., City Opera, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)870-5570; remaining tickets: $45 to $95 tomorrow; $16 to $120 on Tuesday.(Midgette)</p>

Oestreich)</p>
        <p>'LORENZO DA PONTE: A BRIDGE FROM ITALY TO NEW YORK' (Wednesday) Even die-hard Mozart fans may not realize that Lorenzo Da Ponte, the composer's librettist for ''The Marriage of Figaro,'' ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' emigrated to America in 1805 and, among other odd jobs, taught Italian language and literature at Columbia University. As the first event in a series of concerts and programs marking the 200th anniversary of Da Ponte's arrival, Columbia's Italian Academy presents the mezzo-soprano Krista River in a program of songs with texts by Da Ponte. Composers include Mozart, of course, but also Donaudy, Bellini, Verdi and Storace. 8 p.m., Italian Academy, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue at 118th Street, Manhattan, (212)854-1623; $12; students and seniors, $5. (Eichler).</p>
        <p>'EAST MEETS WEST' (Tomorrow) The excellent violinist Daniel Hope is often heard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art performing standard repertory as a member of the Beaux Arts Trio, but here he opens the Met's season on a much more eclectic note. The program features arrangements of familiar works like Ravel's ''Tzigane'' contrasted with Asian-tinged music and Indian ragas, for which Mr. Hope will be accompanied by Shyam Mohan on tabla and Gaurav Mazumdar on sitar. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)570-3949; $40. (Eichler)</p>

        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) In the last three years Lorin Maazel has started the subscription seasons of the New York Philharmonic with the premiere of a commissioned work. This season is beginning more conventionally. The orchestra has commenced its overly hyped ''Elliott Carter Focus'' with the composer's early Holiday Overture, though the Mozart Concerto in A, K. 488 (with Jonathan Biss as soloist) and two scores by Strauss form the substance of the program (repeated today and tomorrow). On Wednesday night Charles Dutoit takes the podium to lead the Philharmonic in works by Ravel, Prokofiev (excerpts from ''Romeo and Juliet'') and Dvorak's Violin Concerto with the always rewarding violinist Sarah Chang. Maazel program: today at 2 p.m. and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Dutoit program: Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'ORION' (Tuesday and Thursday) In assembling this big work, commissioned for the Athens Olympics in 2004, Philip Glass seems to have been as much impresario as composer, bringing together longtime collaborators from around the world. This performance includes Mark Atkins on didgeridoo, Wu Man on pipa, Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle and others. 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene (718)636-4100; $20 to $60. (Oestreich)</p>
        <p>MAKI NAMEKAWA AND DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES (Thursday) Though best known as a conductor, Dennis Russell Davies has a formidable keyboard technique that will be evident in this collaboration with Maki Namekawa, a young pianist who, like Mr. Davies, has a reputation as an eloquent new music player. Their program includes Messiaen's otherworldly ''Visions de l'Amen'' and works by Gyorgy Kurtag, Shoko Shida and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Miller Theater at Columbia University, 116th Street and Broadway, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799; $25.

        <p>*FALL FOR DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) The final three nights of the second annual installment of City Center's wildly successful dance showcase, offering five diverse companies or artists per night for $10 a ticket.

Tonight's program, for instance, offers Molissa Fenley, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Tapage, the New York City Ballet and the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater. Tomorrow's presentation has, among others, les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal, the Brenda Angiel Aerial Dance Company from Buenos Aires and the Paul Taylor Dance Company.

(La Rocco)</p>
        <p>KO MUROBUSHI &amp; EDGE (Thursday through Saturday) Mr. Murobushi, a disciple of the Butoh pioneer Tatsumi Hijikata, continues his master's dark legacy with a piece oddly redolent of spring, ''Handsome Blue Sky (Bibo No Aozora).'' 7:30 p.m., the Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)752-3015, www.japansociety.org; $35. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>*'WATCHING LIGETI MOVE: THREE BALLETS BY CHRISTOPhER WHEELDON' (Tonight and tomorrow night) To inaugurate its season and a festival devoted to the music of Gyorgy Ligeti, the Miller Theater presents dancers from the New York City Ballet and the San Francisco Ballet in three works choreographed by Mr. Wheeldon to Mr. Ligeti's music and never before presented on one program.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic ''outsider'' category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Fabergé. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia itself, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his own work artifacts that he has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossil stones to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the trylon and perisphere (a mini-sculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>*Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, through Oct. 21. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ARNO RAFAEL MINKKINEN: 'VINTAGE PHOTOGRAPHS, 1970-1980' Since the early 1970's, this Finnish-born photographer has been shooting parts of his nude body, mostly in conjunction with natural sites, his obsession leavened by humor. In one photograph his long, bony leg dangles disembodiedly over the stern of a broad-bottomed rowboat against a backdrop of lake, sky and firs; in another the soles of his feet appear magically in the branches of a tree, shot from below, the broad distortion of the feet concealing the body attached to them. Mr. Minkkinen's interest in the interaction of the nude body and the environment suggests the kind of ethereality that earthlings have always longed for. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)262-5050, through Oct. 8. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Henry Wolf Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the extraordinarily suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's own noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>DENNIS ADAMS: 'MAKE DOWN' This brainy political artist presents a video in which he uses film stills from the movie ''Battle of Algiers'' to wipe dark green makeup off his face and body. It's about terrorism, gender, masking and unmasking. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212)627-3680, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ANN AGEE: 'BOXING IN THE KITCHEN' A ceramicist with a playful and not too fussy touch, Ms. Agee has created a whimsical, tabletop landscape in which painted terra-cotta representations of friends and family members in different sorts of costumes cavort among cartoonish pink rock formations. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212)647-1044, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*'Autonomy' Five promising young artists -- Melanie Schiff, Stephen G. Rhodes, Brett Lund, Nathan Hylden and Aaron Curry -- give modernism funk lessons at one of Chelsea's smartest and tiniest galleries. Sol Lewitt and Alexander Calder meet striped bikinis and rubber chickens. And, as in several other shows of late, sculpture, as a medium, is looking like an excellent idea. Foxy Production, 547 West 27th Street, No.6, (212)239-2758, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>LAURA BATTLE Mathematically patterned spots and dots combine with fields of loose painterly abstraction in Ms. Battle's cosmically suggestive paintings and watercolors. Lohin Geduld, 531 West 25th Street, (212)675-2656, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>*TOM BURCKHARDT: 'FULL STOP'  A painter of eclectically layered abstractions has produced a surprising environmental installation: a slightly old-fashioned, fully equipped painter's studio made of brown corrugated cardboard and black paint. Caren Golden, 539 West 23rd Street, (212)727-8304, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ADAM CVIJANOVIC: 'LOVE POEM (TEN MINUTES AFTER THE END OF GRAVITY)' With a deft, representational touch, Mr. Cvijanovic has painted an expansive, airy mural depicting what could be a scene in a Spielberg movie: a Los Angeles suburb that appears to have been violently uprooted and elevated into the sky. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212)929-5959, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Dialogue: Baldessari, Prince, Ruscha, Wool' Four paintings based on words make for a fine four-way conversation in yet another new micro-gallery. They include a funny-joke painting by Richard Prince, a menacing double-entendre by Christopher Wool, an art-about-art paradox by John Baldessari and an illusory farewell by Ed Ruscha. Perry Rubenstein, 534 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'I'M A CHILD OF DIVORCE GIMME A BREAK' The clear leader for best title of the moment. This exhibition, featuring media-saturated collages and sculptures by Michael St. John, and single works by 10 others, is worth a visit, too. Highlights include a sweet, glossy cartoon painting of a hippopotamus by Adrian Ting; a tenderly painted portrait of a cherubic demon by Elizabeth Olbert; a painterly Pop-style picture of a Bromo Seltzer bottle from 1984 by Walter Robinson; and aggressively physical abstract paintings by Suzanne McClelland, Gary Stephan and Josh Smith. Cynthia Broan, 546 West 29th Street, (212)760-0809, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>LAURA LARSON: 'APPARITION' For mysterious reasons, a lot of people these days are interested in photography of the supernatural. Ms. Larson creates rich color photographs of forest interiors and rooms in an abandoned psychiatric asylum in which wisps of smoke or mist suggest spiritual presences. Lennon, Weinberg, 514 West 25th Street, (212)941-0012, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Barry Le Va: '9g-Wagner: Variation II' A large work that was featured in Mr. Le Va's recent retrospective at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia inaugurates this gallery's new home in Chelsea. A severe yet playful arrangement of panels on the wall and variously shaped black boxes and cylinders on the floor, the installation evokes associations with early Modernist abstraction, Minimalism and hip department store décor. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212)223-2227, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MUD' This exceptional four-artist show of small sculpture features lively, insouciant ceramics by the painter Joanne Greenbaum; crusty, off-white ceramics by Elliott Levine that look like ancient artifacts; cartoonish sculptures about modern machines by Aga Ousseinov; and rough, semiabstract sculptures in Styrofoam and papier mâché, alluding to landscapes and furniture, by Yuh-Shioh Wong. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, (212)947-2818, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>ORLAN/BRIAN BELOTT Orlan, the French performance artist, turns from surgical to digital alterations of her features, which she merges with Pre-Columbian artifacts. Mr. Belott pursues more low-tech methods in painted collages, handmade books and a touching slide show of images from other people's lives. Stefan Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212)352-1600, through Oct. 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>PALOMA VARGA WEISZ: 'CHOR' In a demure New York debut dominated by carved limewood busts, this German artist attempts to vivify a late-Gothic figurative style with intimations of Minimalism, Conceptualism and Surrealism. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through Oct. 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>*'Pop Politics Power' In this measured but intense three-artist show, Martha Rosler offers a continuation of her 1967-72 photomontage series ''Bringing the War Home''; Carolee Schneemann is represented by both a new film and by her mesmerizing 1965 ''Viet Flakes,'' in which a rush of grainy black-and-white war photographs looks like smoke billowing from a volcano; and Robert Boyd introduces two spooky videos about doomsday religious cults, past, present and (probably) future. LMAKprojects, 526 West 26th Street, No.310, (212)255-9707, through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>*MONIQUE PRIETO AND LYNDA BENGLIS Ms. Prieto has, in effect, boarded over her abstract paintings with rough-hewn monolithic letters quoting Samuel Pepys's famous diary. Both the wordiness and the klunkiness are a bit familiar, but extracting Pepys's phrases, which are all deliberately disembodied in reference, can be strangely satisfying. In ''The Graces,'' Ms. Benglis continues to evoke figures by other means, in this case three shimmering stacks of vaselike forms made of heavily textured, lavender-tinted resin. The material is perfect for the process-oriented Ms. Benglis, even if her current applications are similar to the work of Andrew Lord and Beverly Semmes. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212)242-7727, through Oct. 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Bill Rice: 'The View from 13 East 3rd' This small show is a chance to catch up with some of this pioneering New York artist's paintings and collages from the 1960's onward. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, second floor, (212)242-6242 , through Oct. 8. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>*JIM ISERMANN A California-based pioneer of art about design, Mr. Isermann here presents a single, long, wraparound wall made of white plastic diamond-shaped modules. It is a canny conflation of Minimalism, Pop and Op Art with subtly thrilling visual effects. Deitch, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)343-7300, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>OHAD MEROMI: 'CYCLOPS' The jarring mixtures of mediums, narratives and genres in the video and installation work of this young Israel-born artist need more focus and entertainment value, but they smartly see that the field of set-up video is relatively open right now, with plenty of room for worlds to collide. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, South Village, (212)206-1290, through Oct. 8. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'PAPER MUSEUMS: THE REPRODUCTIVE PRINT IN EUROPE, 1500-1800' From the early 16th century to the beginning of the 19th, prints that reproduced the original work of artists were the only means of acquainting a broad public with the creative endeavors of Dürer, Raphael, Rubens, Michelangelo and the like. This show displays the variety and vitality of such reproductive prints, and points up how they effectively circulated artists' works and ideas in Europe. Don't expect lots of pictorial splash here. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212)998-6780, through Dec. 3. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Debra Priestly: 'somewhere listening' Ms. Priestly's poetic meditation on ancestry and history consists of life-size charcoal portraits of her own grandparents and six other heroic 19th-century figures of African-American and Indian descent, accompanied by the sounds of old family audio recordings emanating from a set of soup tureens. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, SoHo, (212)226-1660, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>*PHILIP JONES GRIFFITHS For half a century, this documentary photographer has been placing himself squarely in harm's way to record military violence. His pictures of the American war in Vietnam, which make up a substantial part of this show, amount to one of the great tragic portraits of their time, and are required viewing in ours. Denise Bibro Fine Art Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, fourth floor, (212)647-7030, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
