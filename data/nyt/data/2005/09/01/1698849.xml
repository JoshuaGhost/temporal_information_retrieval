        <p>Major League Baseball could have done far better in its attempt to honor the greatest Hispanic ballplayers than its flawed Latino Legends promotion.</p>
        <p>It makes sense to celebrate baseball's Latino influence and provide a history lesson to fans of every ethnicity, but M.L.B.'s effort has faltered in three areas.</p>
        <p>One, voting is restricted to mlb.com and Chevrolet dealerships (the automaker is the sponsor of the ballot); two, at the Web site, voters can only click onto video highlights, not statistics; and three, the lack of outreach by baseball's marketing department to highly regarded outside experts on Latino baseball led to several odd choices among the 60 nominated players.</p>
        <p>To its credit, M.L.B. is trying to fix some of the flaws. It will soon add 10 to 15 names to the online ballot as write-in candidates after consulting with outside experts it had previously neglected, and it is expected to add, at my urging, the players' statistics this morning. Voting began Monday and ends Oct. 10.</p>
        <p>''To the extent that we came up short, we're going to offer a remedy,'' said Tim Brosnan, baseball's executive vice president for business.</p>
        <p>Adding statistics and more nominees will improve the online ballot, but not the paper one that is available to fans who proactively decide to visit a Chevrolet dealership. (Get a ballot, test drive a Malibu?)</p>
        <p>''I'd guess that more people go to a ballpark than to a Chevy dealership, but it's pretzel logic to punish us for doing the promotion,'' Brosnan said.</p>
        <p>Balloting could still be expanded beyond the Internet and the dealerships. In 1999, MasterCard sponsored the All-Century Team, and ballots were available in all ballparks, in MasterCard inserts in TV Guide and in Sports Illustrated, and at Kmart.</p>
        <p>Ballots for the Latino promotion could have been printed in Spanish-language newspapers, but Brosnan said that any inclination to do so was rejected after speaking to M.L.B.'s balloting company. ''The All-Century Team was across the board and much further reaching,'' he said, adding that baseball's most successful balloting occurs online.</p>
        <p>Still, one gets the sense that if tens of thousands of fans can vote at ballparks, the returns cannot be ignored, even if they comprise a small percentage of the votes.</p>
        <p>That may be old-school vox populi, but it's good public relations to appeal to a fan base aggrieved by Roberto Clemente's exclusion from the All-Century team.</p>
        <p>Brosnan said that Hispanic voters were not impeded by the focus on online voting and cited a survey by Jupiter Research, which reported earlier this year that while 65 percent of the United States population is online, 55 percent of Hispanics are.</p>
        <p>Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx, said that Hispanics had made great strides in getting access to the Internet, but that the heavy reliance on the Internet for Latino Legends would hurt turnout.</p>
        <p>''If the ballot is only online or at Chevy dealerships, you curtail voting,'' he said. ''If it was up to me, it would be at bodegas.''</p>
        <p>Now, to some of the nominations. Juan Samuel should be on no one's list of great achievers, not when there is Bobby Avila, who led the American League in batting in 1954 with a .341 average. How did Rafael Palmeiro stay on the list at first base after testing positive for steroids, while Jose Canseco, the professor of anabolics and owner of 462 home runs, was not among 15 outfield nominees?</p>
        <p>Tony Fernandez is a reasonable choice at shortstop, but not as good as Nomar Garciaparra and no better than Omar Vizquel, one of the greatest fielders of his era. Among outfielders, Carlos Beltran (.282 career average) is in, but Cesar Cedeno (.285, with 550 stolen bases, 24th on the career list) is out. Could Cedeno's 1974 conviction for involuntary manslaughter have been a factor?</p>
        <p>If character made Canseco and Cedeno personae non grata, shouldn't the struggles of the great first baseman Vic Power -- a Puerto Rican who won seven consecutive Gold Glove Awards and should have been the first black Yankee -- count for something against, say, the tainted Palmeiro?</p>
        <p>Among pitchers, Joaquin Andujar (127-118 with a 3.58 earned average) but not John Candelaria (177-122, 3.33)? Livan Hernandez (109-100, 4.10) but not Juan Pizarro (131-105, 3.43)? Jose Rijo (116-91, 3.24) but not Mike Garcia (142-97, 3.27)?</p>
        <p>Adrian Burgos Jr., the author of a forthcoming book on Latino baseball, said: ''The ballot over-represents the most recent period. I'm fine if it's 50 percent, but it's two-thirds from the past 20 years, presenting the image that Latinos just got here.''</p>
        <p>The original list of 120 nominees was drawn up inside baseball's offices with the final list of 60 vetted by a number of people and organizations, but no outside historians. An M.L.B. spokesman said last week that Julio Pabon, a Bronx sports marketing executive, was a ''consultant,'' but Pabon said he was not.</p>
        <p>''I thought there'd be a meeting, where we'd be asked, 'Look at this concept, here are the ideas, what do you suggest?''' he said. But the only thing he was asked was to give an opinion about two players. He praised the Latino Legends idea but fears that in its execution, ''Latino participation will be minuscule.''</p>
