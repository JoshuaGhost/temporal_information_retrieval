        <p>Three agency acquisitions have been made in recent days.</p>
        <p>The Epsilon division of Alliance Data Systems in Dallas reached an agreement to acquire Bigfoot Interactive in New York for about $120 million. Investors in Bigfoot include J.P. Morgan Partners and Flatiron Partners.</p>
        <p>Al DiGuido, chief executive at Bigfoot, will become president of Epsilon Interactive. Bigfoot specializes in e-mail marketing campaigns for advertisers like American Honda Motor and Expedia.</p>
        <p>Separately, Ventiv Health in Somerset, N.J., is acquiring inChord Communications in Westerville, Ohio, for $185 million in cash and stock. InChord, parent of agencies like GSW Worldwide, will become a unit of Ventiv, and Blane Walter, chairman and chief executive of inChord, will become president of the Ventiv communications division.</p>
        <p>InChord specializes in advertising and marketing services for pharmaceutical and health care companies. The purchase price may be increased if inChord meets certain financial targets after the acquisition.</p>
        <p>Also, the Cossette Communication Group in Montreal is making another acquisition in the British advertising market, buying a majority stake in Miles Calcraft Briginshaw Duffy in London and in the London agency's direct-marketing unit, named Elvis, as part of a three-stage, six-year deal.</p>
        <p>Cossette will initially pay about 16.8 million Canadian dollars ($14.3 million) for a 51 percent stake in Miles Calcraft and Elvis, which work for clients like the BBC, Cadbury Schweppes and Diageo. The deal terms permit Cossette to increase the stake to 75 percent and then 100 percent. Cossette made its first acquisitions in Britain in 2003 and 2004.</p>
