        <p>Northwest and Delta Move Closer To Filing for Bankruptcy Protection  Two of the nation's biggest and most troubled airlines, Northwest and Delta, appeared likely to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as today, people briefed on the airlines' plans said. Both airlines have been hit hard by the spike in jet fuel prices this month and by relentless competition. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Any airline bankruptcies are unlikely to affect airline customers immediately, not even as far out as the busy holiday travel period. [C18.]</p>
        <p>An Unclear Future for Hospitals in New Orleans  New Orlean's medical industry has been decimated by Hurricane Katrina, and no one can say how many hospitals will reopen. Although some local officials are calling for a central plan, decisions are likely to be based mainly on economic forces -- not necessarily on health care needs. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Corporate good will in the aftermath of Katrina has been anything but run-of-the-mill. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Survey Shows Racial Disparity in Mortgage Lending  Regardless of their income levels, blacks were about three times as likely as whites to take out expensive ''subprime'' mortgages last year, according to a nationwide lending survey by the Federal Reserve. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Panel Rejects One Cancer Drug and Endorses Another  A federal advisory panel rejected a prostate cancer therapy developed by Abbott Laboratories but endorsed a pancreatic cancer medicine from OSI Pharmaceuticals. The advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously not to recommend approval of Abbott's Xinlay for advanced prostate cancer. The drug had failed to achieve the specified goal in two clinical trials but the company had argued that the product nevertheless offered benefit for patients with few options. Market Place. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Decision on Dispute Between Google and Microsoft  Ruling on a request by Microsoft to extend a restraining order, a Seattle judge said a former Microsoft executive, Kai-Fu Lee, could proceed with helping to create a Google research center in China. But the judge restricted him from working on some of his specialties -- search and language technologies -- or using information he acquired while he was a Microsoft vice president. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Bill Gates of Microsoft gave software developers a preview of the next version of the Windows operating system, which will be released in a year. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Associated Press to Start Service for Younger Readers  The Associated Press is about to start a ''younger audience service,'' offering articles and ''experiences'' in multimedia formats, with audio, video, blogs and wireless text, meant to reach readers from 18 to 34 years old. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Hedge Fund Liquidators Can Pursue Inquiry in U.S.  The liquidators overseeing Bayou Management's seven offshore hedge funds have been granted a preliminary injunction by a bankruptcy judge that allows the liquidators to pursue their investigation in the United States. [C5.]</p>
        <p>2 Senior Partners to Leave Kohlberg Kravis  Two senior partners of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company who had been viewed as likely successors to the firm's founders said that they would step down from the firm. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Falter on Oil and Hurricane Concerns  Stocks ended weaker on worries over high oil prices and the effects of Hurricane Katrina. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 85.50 points, at 10,597.44. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.36 points, to 1,231.20. The Nasdaq was down 11.08 points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,171.75. [C8.]</p>
        <p>New York Commercial Real Estate Market Remains Strong  Investors are pouring a stream of capital into the New York City market, and as a result prices of commercial properties in Manhattan continue to rise. Some of the space is being converted into condominiums. Square Feet. [C9.]</p>
        <p>Nokia's Sales and Earnings Show Improvement  Nokia, the leading maker of cellphones, announced improving third-quarter sales, and a new mobile e-mail product designed to compete with BlackBerry and others. Nokia, whose revenue and earnings faltered a year ago when it mismatched its products to the market, said sales for the three months should be 8.4 billion euros ($10.3 billion) to 8.5 billion euros ($10.4 billion), compared with its previous expectations of 7.9 billion euros to 8.2 billion euros. It predicted that earnings would be 18 to 19 cents a share, compared with an earlier estimate of 14 to 17 cents. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Rival Publishers Join in Advertising Effort  Two magazines published by Hachette Filipacchi and three by its rival Hearst are joining forces to carry identical advertising sections in their October issues. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Kinsley Leaves Los Angeles Times for Washington Post  Michael Kinsley, the editorial and opinion editor of The Los Angeles Times, bade farewell to the newspaper after a controversial tenure on what he described as a bitter note. He will join The Washington Post. [C6.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows in July  The nation's trade deficit narrowed in July and producer prices rose at a moderate pace in August, as soaring crude oil costs and petroleum products were unexpectedly offset by falling imports and muted overall inflation. [C3.]</p>
