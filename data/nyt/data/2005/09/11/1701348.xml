        <p>AMERICANS have memorialized Sept. 11 in ways both monumental and minuscule. The tributes range from the tattoos depicting firefighters and flags that people carry on their arms to the colossal project at ground zero in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, the jigsaw puzzle of 169 towns has found ways to remember Sept. 11 that neither disappear under the sleeve of a shirt nor stop traffic. There is a memorial flagpole in New Canaan, a sculpture that was a class project at Windsor High School and the state's official memorial at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, with its sweeping views of Long Island Sound.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS have memorialized Sept. 11 in ways both monumental and minuscule. The tributes range from the tattoos depicting firefighters and flags that people carry on their arms to the colossal project at ground zero in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, the jigsaw puzzle of 169 towns has found ways to remember Sept. 11 that neither disappear under the sleeve of a shirt nor stop traffic. There is a memorial flagpole in New Canaan, a sculpture that was a class project at Windsor High School and the state's official memorial at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport, with its sweeping views of Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>''The minute I drive in, I get a lump,'' said Barbara Kirwin on a recent visit to the Westport site, as she placed a rose on a stone dedicated to her son, Glenn, who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. He was 40.</p>
        <p>Sherwood Island is Connecticut's most prominent memorial site, and like others in the state, it is moving, in a quiet and unassuming way, like a mother crying in her car.</p>
        <p>The terrorist attacks touched the state in profound ways -- none more tragic than the 152 victims who the state said had Connecticut connections. Many have inspired small memorials, like the commemorative flag at the Easton Police Department and the plaque by the weeping cherry tree in John E. Julian Heritage Park in Stafford. In Stamford, there is a monument under a flagpole in Jackie Robinson park and another monument scheduled to be dedicated at Cove Island Park on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''There's so many little ones that have been established,'' said Deanna Lia, the director of the State Office of Family Support, which was formed after Sept. 11 to help families of the victims.</p>
        <p>The Sherwood Island memorial, which was financed primarily through private donations, is both little and grand. The point where it sits is squeezed between two beaches, and it is easy to walk past the memorial itself without noticing. A commemorative granite stone is engraved with a tribute: ''The citizens of Connecticut dedicate this living memorial to the thousands of innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001, and to the families that loved them.'' The area around the stone is landscaped with paths and plants that can withstand the climate near the water.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. John G. Rowland dedicated the memorial, surrounded by the families of victims, just before the one-year anniversary of the attacks.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, Gov. M. Jodi Rell was scheduled to visit the site for a memorial service. It is a suitable setting for such a solemn and contemplative occasion. On a clear day, visitors can see the Manhattan skyline. From the spot where the memorial sits, park workers watched the smoke rise from the World Trade Center the day of the attack. Relief workers later used the park as a staging area.</p>
        <p>In 2003, the state set a series of smaller tiled stones into the ground in a grassy rectangle on either side of the commemorative stone. On each stone is the name of one of the Connecticut victims. Family members and other visitors place shells, stones and flowers on top of them.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't draw too much attention to itself,'' said Brian Brodhead, who was at the memorial last month. ''It makes a simple statement.''</p>
        <p>Nothing about the memorial is monumental. Nothing, that is, except the view of the Sound.</p>
        <p>''My son loved the water,'' said Eunice Hanson, an Easton resident whose son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter died on Sept. 11. ''I think water is always a peaceful component.'' A momument to her son, Peter, is at Joel Barlow High School in Redding.</p>
        <p>For victims' families, local memorials like the one at Sherwood Island serve as a quiet place to reflect, as opposed to the emotionally draining and highly politicized site at ground zero, said Mary Fetchet of New Canaan, who lost her son, Brad, in the attacks and is the founding director of Voices of September 11th, an advocacy group for the families.</p>
        <p>''Many families have made a decision not to go to ground zero,'' Ms. Fetchet said. ''This gives them an opportunity to go and reflect.''</p>
        <p>Many of the Connecticut families now know one another, so when they come to Sherwood Island they end up placing shells on dozens of names. Some family members have established a fund at the Fairfield County Community Foundation to help pay for the upkeep of the memorial.</p>
        <p>In Windsor, its memorial grew out of the work of high school students. In September 2003, Diane Peskurich, a special-education teacher at Windsor High School, gave her social skills class an assignment to improve the school and the community. The class decided to create a simple tribute to the victims of Sept. 11, but with the help of a local sculptor they became even more ambitious.</p>
        <p>''What started out to be just a little wood plaque and some flowers began to take on a life of its own,'' Ms. Peskurich said.</p>
        <p>Lon Pelton, a Windsor artist who makes sculptures with scrap metal, heard about the project and decided to help the students. He joined the bottoms of two discarded oil drums to create a thin cylinder and cut out the images of the towers from them. The students then agreed to drill a hole in the sculpture for each person who died in the attacks, reading the names as they drilled. Mr. Pelton installed lights in between the two oil drums and used sensors to make the lights turn on at night.</p>
        <p>In the daytime, the sun streams through the cutout of the towers to cast a shadow on the ground, and at night the lights glow through the holes as if the World Trade Center were surrounded by stars. The sculpture also moves -- it is on an axle.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely spectacular,'' Ms. Peskurich said.</p>
        <p>For the dedication, the students invited family members, President Bush and Mr. Rowland, who was then the governor. Mr. Rowland gave a speech at the dedication on May 21, 2004.</p>
        <p>''For kids with special needs, they became leaders,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Since the dedication at the high school, the memorial has become a point of pride for the community, she said, and a fund was established to maintain it.</p>
        <p>''It was just something we could give to our town,'' said Sarah Rafala, one of the students who worked on the project.</p>
        <p>In Danbury, a 12-foot tower of glass shimmers on Main Street. The tower, another Sept. 11 memorial, sits in a park between Main Street's northbound and southbound lanes.</p>
        <p>Mayor Mark Boughton announced an initiative to create the memorial on Sept. 11, 2003, and the city gave $45,000 to start the project. Private donations helped cover the rest of the $130,000 project, and a committee was formed to guide it. The artist, Henry Richardson, hollowed out the inside of the glass tower and chiseled its inner walls. Inside the hollowed-out center stands another piece of polished glass etched with the names of the Connecticut victims. Mr. Richardson placed the victims' names in alphabetical order by their first names.</p>
        <p>''It felt much more personal in connecting with the actual victim,'' he said. ''You don't think of your friend as Johnson, Sam, you think of him as Sam.''</p>
        <p>At night, lights spotlight the memorial. Mr. Richardson said he wanted the sculpture, which weighs 6,000 pounds, to seem light and unimposing.</p>
        <p>''The theme of most of my work is healing and reconstruction,'' he said. ''The purpose of the tower was this healing process.''</p>
        <p>One year after Mr. Boughton's announcement, he presided over a dedication ceremony where the sculpture, shrouded in black cloth, was unveiled. About 50 family members of victims showed up, said Michael A. McLachlan, the mayor's chief of staff. Some left flowers and photos of the victims at the memorial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said he was touched by the ceremony and the people who walked up to him to thank him.</p>
        <p>''You could just see the pride in people's eyes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This year, another ceremony has been planned for Sunday to commemorate the victims. But Mr. McLachlan said it does not take an anniversary for people to journey to the site.</p>
        <p>''People sit there for quiet prayer and reflection at all hours of the day,'' he said.</p>
