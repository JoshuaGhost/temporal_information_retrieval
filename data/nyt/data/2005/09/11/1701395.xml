        <p>After an investigation, the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled last week that a Ridgewood basketball league must create a coed program after the organization said that a 12-year-old girl was not eligible to play on a boys' team. The girl, Caitlin Alvaro, applied to play with the boys last October, saying she wanted to use the 10-foot regulation hoop, rather than the 8-foot hoop the girls use. The civil rights division's investigation found that Ridgewood Biddy Basketball denied Caitlin's request ''simply because she is a female,'' said J. Frank Vespa-Papaleo, the division's director. Mr. Vespa-Papaleo said that Biddy must send a letter to all registered girls telling them that they now have the opportunity to play with boys.  John Holl</p>
