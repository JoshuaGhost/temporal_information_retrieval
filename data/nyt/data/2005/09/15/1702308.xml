        <p>The sky was gray, there were plenty of empty seats and the crowd booed the Mets just about as much as it cheered them.</p>
        <p>Such is the atmosphere at Shea Stadium these days, with the Mets' playoff chances all but flatlined.</p>
        <p>They entered last night's game six and a half games out of the National League wild-card spot and were facing a team, the Washington Nationals, that was also fighting for its slim playoff hopes.</p>
        <p>The Nationals proved to be a more deserving playoff contender with a 6-3 victory, their second straight triumph over the Mets. It was the Mets' 14th loss in 17 games.</p>
        <p>Mets starter Kris Benson gave up two home runs in the fifth inning, to Preston Wilson and Vinny Castilla, to pick up his fourth loss in five starts. Benson (9-8) last won Aug. 16 against his former team, the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
        <p>''Every once in a while it seems like he relaxes a little bit,'' Mets Manager Willie Randolph said. ''And when he does, they take advantage of it.''</p>
        <p>The Mets, who are in last place in the National League East, now seem to be concentrating on carrying something positive into the off-season.</p>
        <p>''It's the frustration of how things went south so quick,'' Cliff Floyd said. ''That's what we have to get over. We do have to finish the season strong. It would be a shame not to.''</p>
        <p>The Mets did have some positives last night.</p>
        <p>Second baseman Kazuo Matsui continued his inspired play, extending his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. Carlos Beltran shook himself out of a minor funk with a three-hit performance.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza, meanwhile, returned to a loud ovation after a two-game layoff because of a mild concussion that he sustained when he was beaned in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>But Matsui, Beltran and Piazza could not brighten the spirits at a mostly sullen Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mets fans expressed their displeasure early on as Benson struggled through the first inning.</p>
        <p>Benson walked the leadoff hitter, Brad Wilkerson. He retired the next two batters on grounders as Wilkerson advanced, but then he gave up a run-scoring single to Nick Johnson, drawing the first boos of the evening.</p>
        <p>After surrendering an infield single to Wilson, Benson heard more jeers when he walked Castilla, and he was booed again after throwing three straight balls to Gary Bennett, who eventually flied out to center.</p>
        <p>Benson's teammates helped the crowd forget about his struggles at the outset by tying the score at 1-1.</p>
        <p>After Jos√© Reyes grounded out to lead off, Matsui, the object of the fans' displeasure through most of the season, drilled a triple to center field.</p>
        <p>Beltran, who has also heard boos from the fans, then drove home Matsui with an infield single.</p>
        <p>But the Nationals quickly regained the lead. With one out in the third inning, Castilla grounded to Reyes to score Johnson, who had reached with a hard double to right.</p>
        <p>Bennett followed that with a single to shallow center that scored Wilson and put the Nationals ahead, 3-1.</p>
        <p>Matsui and Beltran again came up with back-to-back hits in the fourth inning to get the Mets back in the game. Matsui, who led off the inning with a single to right field, scored from first base after Beltran doubled over Wilson's head in center field. Two batters later, David Wright grounded out to first as Beltran came home, making it a 3-3 game.</p>
        <p>But Benson could not capitalize on the run support. He retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, but then gave up back-to-back solo home runs to Wilson and Castilla, allowing the Nationals to regain the lead, 5-3.</p>
        <p>''I was glad to see the guys score the runs and get me back in the ballgame,'' Benson said. ''It ultimately just comes down to me just not getting the job done. It really has nothing to do with letting down your guard.''</p>
        <p>After leading off the fifth by striking out, Guillen was ejected from the game for arguing with the umpire Bill Miller. Guillen left Miller a parting gift: he threw several bats onto the field.</p>
        <p>Benson was pulled after the fifth. He gave up five earned runs and eight hits, and he walked three.</p>
        <p>Nationals starter Esteban Loaiza (11-10) was not stellar. But he pitched well enough to hold off the Mets, giving up three earned runs and seven hits. He struck out five.</p>
        <p>Piazza, who is in the final year of his contract, said before the game that he had not been thinking of the future but, rather, has been savoring the season.</p>
        <p>''I'm excited to at least finish the season, at least on the field,'' he said. ''As far as speculation, obviously that's not my job. I'm really just interested in enjoying and finishing these last couple weeks here.''</p>
