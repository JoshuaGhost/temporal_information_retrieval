      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial calls for investigation into complaints that Congress and Bush administration denied Army Corps of Engineers money required to fortify New Orleans against hurricane like Katrina, but says broader question involves imposing real discipline on Army Corps and its paymasters in Congress who fund unnecessary projects in their home districts</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There has been much grumbling that Congress and the Bush administration denied the Army Corps of Engineers the money that was required to fortify New Orleans against a hurricane like Katrina. These complaints need to be pursued. Flood control is mainly a federal obligation, and the agency most responsible for it must have enough money to do the job right.</p>
        <p>But there is another question worth asking: has the Army Corps made wise use of the money it has? Louisiana has received about $1.9 billion over the past four years for corps civil works projects, more than any other state. Although much of this has been spent to protect New Orleans, a lot has also been spent on unrelated water projects -- a new and unnecessary lock in the New Orleans Industrial Canal, for instance, and dredging little-used waterways like the Red River -- mainly to serve the barge industry and other commercial interests.</p>

        <p>There has been much grumbling that Congress and the Bush administration denied the Army Corps of Engineers the money that was required to fortify New Orleans against a hurricane like Katrina. These complaints need to be pursued. Flood control is mainly a federal obligation, and the agency most responsible for it must have enough money to do the job right.</p>
        <p>But there is another question worth asking: has the Army Corps made wise use of the money it has? Louisiana has received about $1.9 billion over the past four years for corps civil works projects, more than any other state. Although much of this has been spent to protect New Orleans, a lot has also been spent on unrelated water projects -- a new and unnecessary lock in the New Orleans Industrial Canal, for instance, and dredging little-used waterways like the Red River -- mainly to serve the barge industry and other commercial interests.</p>
        <p>The Louisiana delegation, second to none in bringing home the bacon, is as much to blame for these skewed priorities as the corps is. Yet the reports of wasted dollars in Louisiana are consistent with the corps's historical profile. Studies by the Government Accountability Office, the National Academy of Sciences and others have documented that the agency has long inflated the economic payoffs of its projects to justify ever greater budget outlays, while underestimating the environmental damage caused by turning free-flowing rivers into lifeless canals and destroying millions of acres of valuable wetlands. This satisfies the corps's appetite for money and Congress's appetite for pork.</p>
        <p>Katrina thus raises an even broader question: has the time not come, finally, to impose some real discipline on the Army Corps and its paymasters in Congress who regard it as their own cookie jar?</p>
        <p>Both the present commander, Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, and his predecessor have promised internal reforms. But the lead must come from Congress, where enlightened reformers like Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold are pushing independent peer review for individual projects and other changes that might truly make a difference.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many other senators -- not just those from Louisiana -- are powerfully addicted to corps projects and the votes they attract, especially Christopher Bond of Missouri, who controls the corps's budget and has single-handedly kept alive a nonessential barge industry on the Missouri River at great cost to the environment and taxpayers. To discipline the corps, Congress must first discipline itself.</p>
