        <p>A Federal District Court judge ordered the city's Department of Environmental Protection yesterday to review and update the methods it uses to monitor and report on the quality of the city's drinking water. The department has been on probation for more than four years and under supervision by a federal monitor for violating federal environmental laws and contaminating the city's water supply in the late 1990's. The order, by Judge Charles L. Brieant, comes two weeks after a department employee pleaded guilty to falsifying water quality records at a Westchester County monitoring station, a federal crime and a violation of the department's probation. Under terms of the court order, the department will also have to develop procedures to ensure that its managers do not keep workers from cooperating with investigators.</p>
