        <p>Along the Hudson, A Storybook World</p>
        <p>Where can you expect to find a bright red dog that's several stories tall, a lizard that rides in a magic school bus and a white rabbit that's a vampire? The answer, not surprisingly, is within the pages of children's books. But on Sunday, young readers can actually meet these characters -- or at least reasonable representations thereof -- at Celebrate Children's Book Day.</p>

        <p>Along the Hudson, A Storybook World</p>
        <p>Where can you expect to find a bright red dog that's several stories tall, a lizard that rides in a magic school bus and a white rabbit that's a vampire? The answer, not surprisingly, is within the pages of children's books. But on Sunday, young readers can actually meet these characters -- or at least reasonable representations thereof -- at Celebrate Children's Book Day.</p>
        <p>This daylong festival, sponsored by Historic Hudson Valley, takes place at an appropriately literary site: the grounds of Sunnyside, the former home of Washington Irving. There, in addition to costumed characters like the ones mentioned above -- Clifford the Big Red Dog, Liz of the ''Magic School Bus'' series and Bunnicula -- youngsters can interact with more than 60 well-known authors and illustrators, who will offer readings, sign books and in some cases lead workshops.</p>
        <p>''A lot of kids run right up to certain authors because they're their favorites,'' said Beth Vetare-Civitello, a producer of the event. ''And it's not as if the authors are distracted by anything else -- that's what they're here for.''</p>
        <p>Just as children's literature embraces everything from toddlers' board books to young-adult novels, Celebrate Children's Book Day will feature writers for every age group. Among this year's visitors are Dan Greenburg (the series ''The Zack Files'' and ''The Onts''), Gail Carson Levine (winner of the Newbery Medal for ''Ella Enchanted'') and Brian Selznick (the prize-winning illustrator of ''Walt Whitman: Words for America'').</p>
        <p>The activities will include storytelling by Gloria Pinckney and Rafe Martin and demonstrations by the author-illustrators Judith Caseley and Christopher Hart. Mr. Hart, a festival newcomer, produces manga, the Japanese-style comic books and graphic novels. But whereas the Japanese version is often violent and for adults, ''Hart does it for 7- to 12-year-olds,'' Ms. Vetare-Civitello said. ''This is a first for us, and we're very excited.''</p>
        <p>Celebrate Children's Book Day, Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., at Sunnyside, West Sunnyside Lane, off Route 9, Tarrytown, N.Y., (914)591-8763; hudsonvalley.org. Tickets: $10; 62+, $9; children, $6; under 5, free.</p>
        <p>A Mouse in the House</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has been invaded by mice. And not the tiny, furry kind -- this variety is about six and a half feet tall and 700 pounds.</p>
        <p>Although this may sound like the premise for a peculiar horror movie -- elegant auction house taken over by giant, art-loving rodents -- the circumstances are much more benign. These are huge, imaginatively painted sculptures of a beloved entertainment symbol: Mickey Mouse.</p>
        <p>''The Disney Company wanted to do a proper 75th-birthday celebration of Mickey,'' said Leila Dunbar, director of Sotheby's collectibles department. ''What better way than to do a tour of Mickey statues?''</p>
        <p>Disney commissioned the 75 works, all identically posed, from TivoliToo, a Minnesota company. It then contacted celebrities, from artists and animators to actors and athletes, to design the mice's decoration. The results include Elton John's ''Music Royalty,'' a Mickey embellished with musical notes, keyboards and Sir Eltonesque glasses; Tom Hanks's ''Space Mouse,'' with astronomical motifs; Jennifer Garner's ''UndercovEAR Mickey,'' with maps and espionage symbols; and James Gandolfini's ''Funny Bones,'' a Mickey in a skeleton costume.</p>
        <p>The free exhibition, called ''Celebrate Mickey: 75 InspEARations,'' on tour since 2003, is making its last stop at Sotheby's. On Tuesday at 2 p.m., the auction house will sell the statues, which do not have estimates. ''You just can't quantify someone's passion or emotion for a character this well known,'' Ms. Dunbar said.</p>
        <p>Not that they will be cheap: Sotheby's expect the auction to net $1 million or more. Although that puts the statues out of the reach of most children's piggy banks, the sale will still benefit youngsters. Each celebrity is donating the proceeds of his or her piece to charities, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation of America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and pediatric AIDS foundations.</p>
        <p>''Celebrate Mickey'' at Sotheby's, third-floor galleries, 1334 York Avenue, at 72nd Street, Manhattan, sothebys.com. Today and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m.; Monday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
        <p>To All a Good Night</p>
        <p>On Sunday the 14th Street Y will hold a celebration at which many are expected to fall asleep. This isn't a comment on the Y's ability to entertain its guests, but a normal outcome: it's a Festival of Lullabies.</p>
        <p>Organized by Jane Kornbluh, the Y's parenting and family education coordinator, this concert and workshop will revive a lost art. ''She heard that we always sing to our baby,'' said Stuart Pyle, an educator and musician who will preside over the festival with his wife, Mik Manenti, who teaches music at the Y. ''Today a lot of parents just put on a tape.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem, Mr. Pyle believes, is a lack of material. The evening should change that: he will sing and play piano, Ms. Manenti will sing and play accordion, and with the help of a folk harpist, a cellist, a flute player and the vocalist and percussionist Vanessa Roe, they will perform and teach lullabies.</p>
        <p>The multicultural menu will include ''Raisins and Almonds'' (Yiddish), ''All the Pretty Horses'' (African-American), ''Now the Day Is Over'' (English), ''Los Pescaditos'' (''The Little Fish'' in Spanish) and ''Les Petits Poissons'' (''The Little Fish'' in French). The last two, Mr. Pyle said, have different music but the same theme. ''The idea is that the little fish swim as well as the big ones do, so don't worry about being little,'' he said. ''It's fascinating that the two cultures had the same ideas.''</p>
        <p>Other common motifs are the moon, animals and angels. ''Some lullabies are even a little hostile,'' he said with a chuckle, citing ''Rock-a-Bye, Baby.'' ''You're frustrated, because you want to go to sleep, too.'' Parents are encouraged to take their infants and toddlers in pajamas. With any luck, the grown-ups can nod along while the little ones nod off.</p>
        <p>Festival of Lullabies, Sunday, 5 to 6:30 p.m., the 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 780-0800, Ext. 221. Tickets: $20 a family.</p>
