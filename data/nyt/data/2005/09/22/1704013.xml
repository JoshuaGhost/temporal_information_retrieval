        <p>HARDWARE can be the great finishing touch in a renovation project, and for homeowners who are restoring an old house or apartment, the right touch is often a period knob, hinge or door knocker. Charles Lockwood, author of ''Bricks and Brownstone'' (Rizzoli, 2003) and a specialist in restoration, pointed out that ''19th-century New Yorkers were very proud of their hardware'' -- all the more reason to seek out the right replacements, whether originals or reproductions. But a house does not have to be old to be flattered by a period piece. Vintage hardware can also enrich a modern white box.</p>
        <p>1. An ornate, six-inch-long bronze door buzzer is a reproduction of a Victorian piece; $109.95 from House of Antique Hardware in Portland, Ore., which also does custom reproductions; houseofantiquehardware.com or (888)223-2545.</p>
        <p>2. Also from House of Antique Hardware: a bronze doorknob made in about 1895 and called Judgment/Priest; $995.</p>
        <p>3. House of Antique Hardware cabinet knobs, in hexagonal and fluted glass, come in clear as well as in many colors; $2.29 to $9.95.</p>
        <p>4. Bathroom faucet handles and knobs made from the 1890's to the 1920's are porcelain with nickel or chrome plated brass. They are $20 to $40 from Historic Houseparts in Rochester, www.historichouseparts.com or (888)558-2329.</p>
        <p>5. A 16-inch-long dragon-shape door handle is cast in bronze and based on a 19th-century design; $595 from Liz's Antique Hardware in Los Angeles, (323)939-4403 or www.lahardware.com.</p>
        <p>6. Also from Liz's: vintage iron doorknobs and plates, some dating to the early 20th century; from $14.</p>
        <p>7. An egg-shape doorknob and square plate in hammered bronze has a satin nickel or oil-rubbed finish; $73.99 from Van Dyke's Restorers, in Woonsocket, S.D., www.vandykes.com or (800)558-1234.</p>
        <p>8. Also from Van Dyke's: a heavy duty oil-black iron pull (also available with a rust finish), 18 3/4 inches long and 5 3/8 inches wide; $49.99.</p>
        <p>9. A Victorian-style interior doorknob and plate are made of brass and have a Japanese motif; $799.60 from Crown City Hardware in Pasadena, Calif., www.crowncityhardware.com or (800)950-1047.</p>
        <p>10. Also from Crown City: a reproduction of a 19th-century W.H. Carr iron hinge; $30.50.</p>
