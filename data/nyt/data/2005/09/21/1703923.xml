        <p>Hurricane Rita brushed past Key West on Tuesday and was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later in the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuating this feeble city, as well as parts of Louisiana and Texas.</p>
        <p>From the tip of the Florida peninsula to Galveston, Tex., thousands left their homes or made plans to, including many who had already fled once, from Hurricane Katrina, and were living in shelters and temporary housing. In Houston, officials moved evacuees from New Orleans out of the Reliant Arena and sent many of them on to Arkansas.</p>
        <p>In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco asked President Bush on Tuesday to declare a state of emergency for her battered state as it prepares for Hurricane Rita. She requested $10 million in assistance.</p>
        <p>Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Rita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approaches Texas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane Katrina was a Category 4 storm when it devastated parts of the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Aug. 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAdie said western Louisiana could also bear the brunt of the storm depending on changes in steering currents.</p>
        <p>''It's better not to nail it down too precisely,'' he said. ''Over the next day or so we'll have a better idea.''</p>
        <p>The threat of a new storm aligned federal and local authorities in Louisiana, at least publicly, after weeks of tension over the response to Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>President Bush, who had visited Mississippi earlier, attended a briefing in New Orleans. Later in the day, Mr. Bush signed legislation to increase the borrowing authority of the government's flood insurance program to $3.5 billion from $1.5 billion to pay claims from Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>''All up and down this coastline people are now preparing for what is anticipated to be yet another significant storm,'' the president said. He said Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen would remain in charge of the federal effort in Louisiana and Mississippi and that ''we've got another admiral who is now being stationed in Texas, to coordinate the relief response.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also praised the New Orleans mayor, C. Ray Nagin, who decided Monday to suspend a staggered reopening of parts of the city.</p>
        <p>''He made a wise decision to say to people, be cautious about returning here, because a rain of any amount could cause these levees to break again,'' the president said.</p>
        <p>The mayor, prickly a day earlier under pressure from the president and Admiral Allen to delay the return of residents into parts of the city, gave the admiral a T-shirt at a news conference on Tuesday outside City Hall, where generators still supply power and most key operations have moved across the street to the battered Hyatt Hotel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nagin said the words on the T-shirt read: ''I love New Orleans.''</p>
        <p>The official death toll in Louisiana remained at 736. In Mississippi, 219 people died from the storm.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press reported that a 72-year-old man, John Lyons, had been found alive in his home in New Orleans. Mr. Lyons's wife, Leola, also 72, was found dead.</p>
        <p>In the city, mostly empty of residents but with its physical core still vulnerable, the possibility of heavy rain and a storm surge prompted officials to make emergency efforts to bolster its weakened levee system, station 500 buses on its outskirts to evacuate remaining residents and establish a military hospital at the convention center, which just weeks ago was the scene of violence and desperation for thousands of trapped evacuees from Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>In Florida, Hurricane Rita lashed Key West as it passed about 50 miles south of the island on Tuesday afternoon, flooding roads, yards and beaches through much of the Keys but not inflicting the severe damage many had feared. Late Tuesday night, it bordered on Category 3 strength as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, with sustained winds near 110 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>The Lower and Middle Keys were cut off from the rest of Florida for most of the day after Route 1 closed because of flooding. A quarter-mile section of the highway on Lower Matecumbe Key was closed because of a storm surge. Law enforcement officials said the roads were strewn with debris, although that did not stop the curious from driving. A few bars and restaurants stayed opened and drew restless crowds.</p>
        <p>''We were not asked to close, and we won't close until we are,'' said Michael Pastore, a bartender at Don's Place, a Key West bar that opened at 7 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>By late afternoon, about 24,000 homes and businesses in Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties had no electricity far fewer than when Hurricane Katrina hit South Florida on Aug. 26, killing 11. In Miami, which suffered only rain squalls, tame winds and minor flooding, officials said government offices and schools would reopen Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Gov. Jeb Bush said that 2,400 National Guard troops had been mobilized and 2,000 more were on alert in case the storm the seventh to hit Florida in 13 months -- proved devastating. Hospitals and nursing homes in the Keys, eager to avoid the mistakes of New Orleans, evacuated their patients on Monday.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans, Mr. Nagin said perhaps as few several hundred people were still living in the city's most vulnerable areas, in addition to the thousands of military and emergency workers who had come to help it recover. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, who is leading military efforts in the recovery, emphasized that evacuees taken to the convention center would be quickly transported out of town.</p>
        <p>''We're not going back into that convention center and Superdome business,'' he said, alluding to the days of televised despair when tens of thousands of mostly poor black residents were trapped by floodwaters in the two buildings.</p>
        <p>Two busloads of residents were evacuated from the convention center on Tuesday, the mayor said.</p>
        <p>The mayor said officials would be more aggressive in pushing for evacuation on Wednesday if the storm turns toward the city, but he said they would not force people from their homes. General Honoré said about 14,000 troops in the region would move into shelters capable of withstanding Category 5 storms, the strongest measured on the Saffir-Simpson scale.</p>
        <p>The city's weakened levee system could be breached by a storm surge as low as five feet, said Brig. Gen. Robert Crear of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps, which has used sandbags, stones and concrete to seal breaches in several levees, does not expect the levees to be fully repaired until June 1, the start of the 2006 hurricane season.</p>
        <p>General Crear said canals with repaired levees were being blocked at Lake Pontchartrain, to prevent pressure from building on the levees. In addition to storm damage, he said that the levees may have been damaged by barges that broke lose during Hurricane Katrina but that he was not certain.</p>
        <p>''We had barges sitting on top of levees,'' he said. ''We had barges sitting on the other side of levees. We don't know yet. We have not done the forensics yet.''</p>
        <p>The state continued to grapple with the costs of the destruction from Hurricane Katrina. The governor announced that she had signed an order freezing the state budget in anticipation of a loss of $750 million to $1 billion in state revenues from the effects of thee hurricanes. That order, signed Monday night, includes a hiring freeze for state agencies and is intended to save $30 million to $50 million in spending, she said, adding that it ''will be the first of many.''</p>
        <p>Officials in Galveston called for a voluntary evacuation before Hurricane Rita emerged into the gulf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said Tuesday that he had also spoken to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas ''on the planning for what we pray is not a devastating storm -- but there's one coming.''</p>
        <p>R. David Paulison, the acting director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in Washington on Tuesday that 45 truckloads of water, 45 truckloads of ice and 8 truckloads of ready-to-eat meals were being staged in Texas in advance of the storm. Nine urban search and rescue teams and nine disaster medical assistance teams also are to arrive.</p>
        <p>The agency, still facing criticism for its response to Hurricane Katrina, has more search and rescue teams available in Texas than it did along the Gulf Coast in the advance of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>The Texas National Guard has also started withdrawing troops from Louisiana to prepare for landfall by Hurricane Rita, Louisiana National Guard officials said.</p>
        <p>About 1,000 Texas troops were recalled, Lt. Michael Odie said. Along Interstate 10, convoys of military trucks drove west, some with handwritten signs with ''Katrina'' crossed out and ''Rita'' written beside the words ''Texas Bound.''</p>
