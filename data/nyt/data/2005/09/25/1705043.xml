        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read your observation that ''even the patients often have a negative view about abortion,'' I thought well, why wouldn't they, given the strong anti-abortion bias in the United States?</p>
        <p>Contrast the United States with countries in which the national dialogue is not dominated by fundamentalist and conservative religions. Studies show that women do not suffer guilt and regret in enlightened countries as they do here.</p>
