        <p>AN absurdist comic monologue might have seemed an odd choice to commemorate the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, particularly when it introduced kooky, world-weary Veronica to a still-grieving gathering.</p>
        <p>Having committed suicide after suffering a delayed reaction to her dread of Skylab falling, Veronica was seen struggling to avoid reincarnation and returning to a world in which ''terrorism and anthrax and smallpox and monkey pox and a pox on everybody's houses'' are the order of the day. She insisted, instead, on remaining stuck in a netherworld limbo.</p>
        <p>The author of this bizarre response to 9/11 is Christopher Durang, that enfant terrible of the theater who, for more than 30 years (''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' ''The Marriage of Bette and Boo''), has flouted all traditional boundaries of good taste and propriety in his loony assaults on contemporary culture.</p>
        <p>McCarter Theatre Center, in association with the Off Broadway theater Playwrights Horizons, is presenting the world premiere here of ''Miss Witherspoon,'' a 90-minute expanded version of Mr. Durang's 2002 offering. Veronica's monologue, a stand-up routine performed with punch by the putty-faced Kristine Nielsen, still opens the work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durang then introduces Maryamma, a sari-clad Indian played by Mahira Kakkar with a beatific smile and unflappable serenity. Maryamma is Veronica's spiritual guide, spewing an endless stream of otherworldly psychobabble. She never loses her cool, even when Veronica demands to speak with someone above her, namely Gandhi.</p>
        <p>''The middle letters of my name are not 'n' as in Nancy,'' she primly instructs Veronica, ''but 'm,' as in mellifluous.''</p>
        <p>A series of skits and sketches, some more tedious than others in spite of sharp direction by Emily Mann and a fine cast of actors, produces musings on such diverse subjects as the Crucifixion, Camus and Sartre, Rex Harrison's previous incarnations and the United States' bombing of Iraq. Sophomoric jokes serve as punctuation.</p>
        <p>Veronica, now called Miss Witherspoon by Maryamma due to her ''brown tweed aura,'' is pushed by her guru to re-engage the fractured and perilous world she had soundly rejected. Nightmare incarnations -- as a preternaturally bright infant in an affluent Connecticut household; as Ginny, a child with druggy trailer-trash parents (Colleen Werthmann and Jeremy Shamos in hilarious yet chilling performances); as an adolescent Ginny, failing at school and becoming addicted to drugs; and as a dog that is run over by a car -- all persist in ending with Veronica suicidal.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't make good karma,'' Maryamma reminds her. ''You don't get ahead with suicide.''</p>
        <p>Guest appearances by a sassy black woman in a big Sunday-go-to-meetin' hat who claims she's Jesus (the wonderful Lynda Gravatt) and by a man with a gray beard and long robe and carrying a staff who introduces himself as Gandalf from ''Lord of the Rings'' (again Mr. Shamos) suggest a feel-good ending in the offing.</p>
        <p>And feel-good it becomes. Which leads us to this question, intriguing given Mr. Durang's reputation as a lapsed Catholic: Can a former nihilist named Veronica with a penchant for suicide be turned into a ''pacifist Christian who teaches the importance of breaking down tribal differences''?</p>
        <p>''Miss Witherspoon,'' McCarter Theatre Center, Berlind Theatre, Princeton, through Oct. 16. Information: (609)258-2787 or at www.mccarter.org.</p>
