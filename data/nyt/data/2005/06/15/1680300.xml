        <p>THE French have a thing for abbreviations. ''Boul' Mich'' is the Boulevard St. Michel; ''sympa'' is sympathetic, ''McDo'' is -- well, you know what that is. And then there is Pudlo.</p>
        <p>''Check it out in Pudlo,'' someone will say here. Or, ''Do you have the new Pudlo?'' Or, ''Pudlo says it is really great.''</p>
        <p>For many Parisians, especially the younger, active types who nightly crowd into the city's brasseries and bistros, Le Pudlo is the restaurant guide. Pudlo is an abbreviation, too; it's short for Pudlowski, Gilles Pudlowski to be precise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pudlowski, 54, is the author of Le Pudlo Paris. In fact, he's the author of a family of food and travel guides. There is Le Pudlo France and there are Pudlos for Corsica, Alsace and Luxembourg. At times, it seems that there are as many Gilles Pudlowskis as there are Pudlo books. He is the full-time food and restaurant critic for Le Point magazine. He is also Le Point's travel editor. He writes weekly food columns for two newspapers, the Républicain Lorrain in Metz, and the Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace in Strasbourg. He contributes regularly to Saveurs and other French food magazines and he appears weekly on French television. He has published dozens of books, most of them food and travel guides, including one in German: ''Paris für Feinschmecker'' (''A Gourmet's Paris''). There are also two memoirs, a novel and, just last year, what might be best described as a cautionary tale: ''How to be a Food Critic and Keep Your Figure.''</p>
        <p>The sacrosanct Guide Michelin has nothing to worry about, at least not from Mr. Pudlowski. Michelin's familiar red book sold about 900,000 copies worldwide last year. Le Pudlo Paris sold some 14,000 copies and the massive Pudlo France about 28,000. (The books, published by Michel Lafon, are 18 euros, or about $21.75.)</p>
        <p>Not that Michelin does not have its share of problems, which are aiding Le Pudlo and a lot of other guides, for that matter, including defections from a few chefs who say they are tired of trying to maintain their stars. While the audiences for both the Michelin and the Pudlo inevitably overlap, each also appeals to different readers. Cautious Michelin may wait several years before recognizing a restaurant, even a good one, which can be reassuring for older travelers and timid tourists. The Pudlo books cater to readers who want to know the newest places as soon as possible. Moreover, neighborhood by neighborhood, Pudlo features the best butchers, bakers, cheese makers and tea rooms. Invaluable for Parisians, less so for Americans whiling away a week at the Ritz.</p>
        <p>Michelin distances itself from the places it critiques. Not the Pudlo. Mr. Pudlowski is the mirror image of the gimlet-eyed Michelin inspector working anonymously and alone. Outgoing, ebullient and garrulous -- often like his reviews -- he loves restaurants and chefs. And he scoffs at anonymity. ''An idiotic idea,'' he said. ''Restaurateurs know a critic when they see one. What counts is honesty, whether they know you or not. Being incognito guarantees neither the reviewer's competence or his judgment.''</p>
        <p>And like virtually all European food critics except for Michelin, Mr. Pudlowski has no objection to accepting free meals. ''Whether the restaurant pays or I pay makes no difference,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Where Michelin awards stars, Pudlo bestows plates -- dinner plates. One plate represents a good table; two a great table and three, one of the best tables in Paris. A broken plate stands for a once-noteworthy place that no longer rates any recommendation. Some years ago, Mr. Pudlowski pulled a plate from Michel Rostang, a two-plate restaurant in the 17th Arrondissement.</p>
        <p>''Michel is a good friend,'' Mr. Pudlowski said, ''but he had slipped; I had no choice. He couldn't believe what I had done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rostang took the warning; he has a glowing review in the 2005 Pudlo, but still only one plate.</p>
        <p>Some years ago, when Le Duc, a well-known Left Bank seafood restaurant found itself saddled with the dreaded broken plate -- l'assiette cassée in French -- the outraged owners saddled Mr. Pudlowski with a crate of 1,000 broken plates. In the 2005 Pudlo, Le Duc is back to one plate.</p>
        <p>''The place had its problems,'' the current review says, ''but it has once again become one of the finest restaurants in Paris for seafood.''</p>
        <p>With 2,300 addresses in the current Pudlo Paris and almost 9,000 in the Pudlo France, it's obvious that Mr. Pudlowski can do only a fraction of the reviewing. He does the writing -- the text is literate and witty -- but he relies, he says, on a staff of a dozen or more plus a network of friends, colleagues and acquaintances, including restaurateurs he has reviewed, to supply him with information.</p>
        <p>''I am like an orchestra conductor,'' he said. ''My job is to keep everything in order. Lenin said the most important thing was to explain, explain, explain. For me it's verify, verify, verify. Addresses, telephone numbers, business hours, the chef's name. Paul Bocuse says food is only fifty percent of the restaurant experience; I have to concentrate on the rest.''</p>
        <p>Gilles Pudlowski was born not far from Metz in eastern France, a region to which he remains closely attached, not least because both Metz and nearby Strasbourg are cities with vibrant Jewish communities. His Jewish roots and indeed his early life as a Jew in France are the subject of his first and deeply personal memoir, ''Le Devoir de Francais'' (''The Duty to be French''), which has never been translated into English. After studies in Paris in the 60's -- he took part in the student riots in 1968 -- he set out to be a literary critic.</p>
        <p>''I was working for Nouvelles Littéraires,'' the review, he said, ''when an editor suggested I do some things on gastronomy. I'm still at it.''</p>
        <p>For five years he worked for Henri Gault and Christian Millau, who popularized ''nouvelle cuisine'' and founded the once-powerful Gault-Millau restaurant guides, then moved on to Le Point and his own ever expanding collection of guides. The personal cost has been high. He has a vacation home near Strasbourg, but in Paris he works out of a sunless bachelor apartment, drinking green tea, engulfed in books and paper and the shabby detritus of two failed marriages. He has three children: a married daughter in Los Angeles, a son studying in Australia and a teenage daughter living with her mother in Paris.</p>
        <p>''It was Millau who told me: 'In this business, some people know how to eat and some know how to write. Hardly anyone can do both, and there are a lot who can do neither. If you can do both, you're sure to succeed.''' He appears to have succeeded: the 2005 Pudlo Paris, the largest ever, is the 15th edition.</p>
        <p>''I still love the work,'' he said. ''I am still excited when I try a new place.'' Somewhere buried in one of his books is a quotation that could serve as his life's goal. It was Serge Diaghilev's plea to Jean Cocteau, who was designing a ballet for him.</p>
        <p>''Étonne-moi, Jean,'' Diaghilev said. ''Astonish me.''</p>
