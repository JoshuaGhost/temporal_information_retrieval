        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Employers looking for copy editors should look for college grads who took Stanley Fish's composition class and hire them quickly.</p>
        <p>His students will be able to untangle other people's sentences -- preferably sentences that are written in their own made-up languages but maybe in English as well. And his students won't ask any uncomfortable questions because they will not care what the language means or what it may do to other people.</p>
        <p>We learn what we are taught. What Stanley Fish teaches isn't writing.</p>
        <p>Deborah Brandt  Madison, Wis., May 31, 2005</p>
        <p>The writer is an English professor at the University of Wisconsin.</p>
