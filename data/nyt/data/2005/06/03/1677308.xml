        <p>Shares of Biogen Idec and Elan fell yesterday on news that a fourth patient may have developed the life-threatening brain infection that prompted the companies to halt sales of their multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri earlier this year.</p>
        <p>If the fourth case of the normally extremely rare infection is confirmed, it would make it more difficult for the drug to return to the market, doctors and analysts said.

        <p>Shares of Biogen Idec and Elan fell yesterday on news that a fourth patient may have developed the life-threatening brain infection that prompted the companies to halt sales of their multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri earlier this year.</p>
        <p>If the fourth case of the normally extremely rare infection is confirmed, it would make it more difficult for the drug to return to the market, doctors and analysts said. The new case might indicate the drug is more dangerous than previously thought because it appears the fourth patient might have taken the drug for a substantially shorter time than the other three.</p>
        <p>Lenore Gelb, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, said yesterday that the agency had ''been notified by Biogen of a fourth case of symptoms that are suggestive of'' the infection. She said the agency was in discussions with Biogen, which is investigating the case.</p>
        <p>The possibility of a fourth afflicted Tysabri user was first reported yesterday by The Boston Globe, which obtained data on the patient through a freedom of information request to the F.D.A.</p>
        <p>Tim Hunt, a spokesman for Biogen Idec, said the company would not confirm or deny the report because it was no longer commenting on individual cases. He said the company was evaluating the medical records of all the patients who took Tysabri and hoped to have a complete report by the end of the summer.</p>
        <p>Brian McGlynn, a spokesman for Elan, said it was ''absolute speculation'' to conclude that a fourth person had the infection, which is called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or P.M.L.</p>
        <p>Shares of Elan, an Irish company counting on Tysabri to help it recover from financial problems, plummeted $1.14, or 14 percent, to close at $6.85 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they trade as American depository receipts. Last November, the stock hit a 52-week high of $30.45</p>
        <p>Shares of Biogen, which is less dependent on Tysabri, fell $1.70 or 4 percent, to $38.07. In mid-February, before the drug's problems were disclosed, the stock reached a high of $70. Tysabri received accelerated approval from the F.D.A. in November because it looked to be more effective than existing drugs for multiple sclerosis. But in late February the companies announced that they were suspending sales because two patients had come down with P.M.L. and one of them had died. In March, the companies reported a third case, also fatal.</p>
        <p>P.M.L. is caused by the reactivation in the brain of the JC virus, which is present in most adults but normally kept inactive by the immune system. Tysabri might weaken the immune system allowing the virus to reactivate.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGlynn of Elan said the patient with the new possible case was not someone who had participated in clinical trials of the drug, as the other three confirmed P.M.L. patients had done. That would suggest the person would have received only a few monthly doses at most, since the drug was not generally available before November.</p>
        <p>''If this someone who got three or four doses that would be a major concern,'' said Dr. Patricia K. Coyle, a professor and the acting chairwoman of neurology at SUNY Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>The first two patients had taken Tysabri, in combination with Avonex, another multiple sclerosis drug from Biogen for more than two years. The third patient, who had Crohn's disease, had received 8 doses of Tysabri over 18 months and had not taken Avonex.</p>
        <p>The report to the F.D.A. on the fourth possible case, which the agency released yesterday, is very sketchy. It merely lists more than 20 symptoms and conditions of the patient, including P.M.L. and JC virus infection, without stating how the diagnoses were made. The 48-year-old woman, who was hospitalized but is still alive, was taking Avonex as well Tysabri plus two other multiple sclerosis drugs which were not suspected of causing the problems.</p>
        <p>Kelly Martin, the chief executive of Elan, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting last week that he was confident Tysabri could return to the market, remarks that caused the company's stock to rise 11 percent in a day.</p>
        <p>The report on the fourth suspected case went to the F.D.A. on April 18. Mr. McGlynn, the Elan spokesman, said that when Mr. Martin spoke he ''knew that there was an unconfirmed report and it continues to be unconfirmed.'' He added, ''Nothing has happened to make us no longer stand behind the statements he made.''</p>
        <p>Biogen, which is one of the largest and oldest biotechnology companies, plans to hold its annual meeting today in Cambridge, Mass., where it is based.</p>
        <p>The sharp reaction of investors yesterday raised questions about whether the companies should have disclosed the fourth possible case as a material event.</p>
        <p>John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University, said companies did not have to disclose material events until they filed quarterly reports. In this case, he said, a reasonable case could be made that the diagnosis had not been confirmed, so there was nothing to disclose.</p>
        <p>Joel Sendek, an analyst at Lazard, said he thought that even with an additional case or two of P.M.L., Tysabri could still return to the market. But its sales would be ''a shadow of its former self.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 4, 2005, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the possibility that a fourth patient might have developed the brain infection that prompted two companies -- Biogen Idec and Elan -- to halt sales of the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri included erroneous information from a spokesman for Elan about its chief executive's knowledge of the case. Yesterday the company said that the chief, Kelly Martin, did not know about the case when he told shareholders at a meeting last week that he was confident Tysabri could return to the market.</p>
