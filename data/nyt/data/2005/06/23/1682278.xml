        <p>The first heated pool in America was not a tycoon's private indulgence but rather a public spa: the Victoria Pool, built by New York State in 1935 at Saratoga Springs. Jean Harlow and Ethel Barrymore were among the celebrities who sunbathed on its limestone deck, surrounded by Georgian Revival pavilions and arcades. The pool reopens July 2 after a three-year, $2 million facelift. Lion-head fountains spout water again, and lilacs and daylilies line the limestone paths. But the water is still chilly, as it has been for some 60 years; the 1930's boilers proved so costly to operate that the state shut them. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation says it hopes to install an alternative energy source within a year or two. Victoria Pool, Saratoga Spa State Park, (518)584-2000, saratogaspastatepark.org.</p>
