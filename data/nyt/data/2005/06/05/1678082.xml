        <p>Jack Schachter and his wife, Hedda Kleinfeld Schachter, live on the Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. They are miles from the other Fifth Avenue, in Brooklyn, where in 1941 Mrs. Schachter's father opened a small fur store that grew into Kleinfeld Bridal, a wedding emporium that drew customers from around the world.</p>
        <p>The Schachters sold the store in 1990, but last week they were once again the center of attention in their former neighborhood, after the announcement that Kleinfeld's new owners would move the store to Manhattan over the summer. Mr. and Mrs. Schachter still own most of the land that the store occupies, and nervous Bay Ridge business owners are waiting anxiously to hear what tenants will replace Kleinfeld Bridal.</p>

        <p>Jack Schachter and his wife, Hedda Kleinfeld Schachter, live on the Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. They are miles from the other Fifth Avenue, in Brooklyn, where in 1941 Mrs. Schachter's father opened a small fur store that grew into Kleinfeld Bridal, a wedding emporium that drew customers from around the world.</p>
        <p>The Schachters sold the store in 1990, but last week they were once again the center of attention in their former neighborhood, after the announcement that Kleinfeld's new owners would move the store to Manhattan over the summer. Mr. and Mrs. Schachter still own most of the land that the store occupies, and nervous Bay Ridge business owners are waiting anxiously to hear what tenants will replace Kleinfeld Bridal.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to get people together and united and get this space filled by a different owner,'' said Jim Clark, vice president of the Flood Company, a real estate brokerage that has been in the neighborhood since 1947. ''Everybody's reaching out to anybody they know to get the space filled.''</p>
        <p>At stake are the fortunes of numerous other businesses that sprung up around Kleinfeld, selling shoes, jewelry, wedding veils and even lunch to the store's tens of thousands of yearly customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schachter, who owns five of the seven storefronts between 82nd and 83rd Streets that Kleinfeld's occupies, said last week that he was aware of the building's importance, and that he wanted to do right bythe neighborhood that gave himhis start.</p>
        <p>''I really don't want to destroy Bay Ridge,'' he said. ''I don't want it to become all food markets. I want it to stay retail, good stores.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schachter said he has had received inquiries but had made no decision about the space, which is about 15,000 square feet, plus two upper floors that could be used as apartments.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Bay Ridge watches.</p>
        <p>''We have some feelers out,'' said Basil Capetanakis, who has a retail and mortgage business on Fifth Avenue and is trying to start a local business improvement district. ''It's an ideal spot for a real strong retail store. The business is here. Kleinfeld's was doing tremendously here, tremendous business.''</p>
