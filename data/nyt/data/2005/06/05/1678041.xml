        <p>Insurgent Hide-Out Found  American marines have discovered an elaborate series of underground bunkers used recently by insurgents in western Iraq, with heavy weapons, a kitchen and fresh food, furnished living quarters, showers and even a working air conditioner found in the complex.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Syria Denies Missile Tests  Syria's information minister denied Israeli claims that his country test-fired Scud missiles in May, calling the accusations an ''expression of Israel's hostile intentions.''</p>
        <p>14</p>
        <p>Palestinian Vote Delayed  The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, announced that he would postpone the July 17 legislative elections, allowing more time for changes to a new election law but drawing swift criticism from the militant group Hamas.</p>
        <p>20</p>
        <p>Hezbollah Is Focus of Election  The future of Hezbollah and its militia will be the primary issue as voters in the impoverished, predominantly Shiite southern part of Lebanon head to the polls to elect candidates for 23 seats representing the region in the 128-seat Parliament.</p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>Political Scandal in Brazil  With an inquiry now under way in the Brazilian Congress, a growing corruption scandal has put President Luiz In치cio Lula da Silva on the defensive and sapped popular support for his government just as the political maneuvering in advance of next year's presidential election is heating up.</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>Blair Seeks More Africa Aid  Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain is expected to ask President Bush to join the leaders of other rich nations in forging a kind of modern day Marshall Plan for Africa.

        <p>Richer Than Rich  The people at the top of America's money pyramid have so prospered in recent years that they have pulled far ahead of the rest of the population. They have even left behind people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Call them the hyper-rich.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>A Crucial Test for a Senator  Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, faces a crucial test of whether he can re-establish his authority after a rapid sequence of events that many say have diminished his standing and exposed a lack of experience in Congressional intrigue.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Enhancing Airport Security  Security at the nation's airports could be enhanced even as passenger traffic rises by quickly making a wide range of relatively modest changes in screening passengers and bags, a report by the Department of Homeland Security has concluded.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Role-Playing to Train Guards  In response to the prisoner-abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib, the Army is taking lessons learned from combat zones to train its security forces for guard duty at American detention centers in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guant치namo Bay, Cuba.</p>

        <p>New Parcel for Trade Center  The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation will buy the next-to-last privately owned parcel needed to redevelop the World Trade Center from the Milstein real estate family, state officials said.</p>
