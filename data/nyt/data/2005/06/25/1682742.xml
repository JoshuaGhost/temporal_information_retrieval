        <p>MARGARET MEAD. Louis Leakey. Bill Gates?</p>
        <p>Grouping the founder of Microsoft among great anthropologists is not as strange as it first sounds, according to the current issue of Fortune Small Business.</p>
        <p>In an effort to grow ever closer to its customers, Microsoft has hired numerous social scientists, including anthropologists, to help it understand the natives, who in this case are the small-business owners who use its software.</p>
        <p>The research is part of Microsoft's effort to produce its Office Small Business Accounting software, although this approach to understanding customers would seem applicable not only for other Microsoft products, but also for just about every other company that sells a product.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's idea behind going into the field to study customers is simple, as Richard McGill Murphy writes in the article ''Getting to Know You'': the better you understand how your customers work, the easier it becomes to design products and services to meet their needs.</p>
        <p>And the more you understand where the market is heading, the easier it is to get there first.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, all Microsoft would have needed to do to understand the small-business market would be to look inside its own offices in Redmond, Wash. No more. Microsoft is now a company with $37 billion in annual sales and 57,000 employees, and so the need to hire anthropologists.</p>
        <p>Maybe Harrison Ford can play Mr. Gates in the movie.</p>
        <p>LATER-LIFE PLANNING -- It isn't news that people are living longer in retirement.</p>
        <p>But what is different is how they spend their money once they stop working, according to this month's Financial Planning, a magazine geared to financial advisers, which contends that there's a need to rethink how retirements are financed.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, financial planners have worried about making sure a retiree's money lasts, assuming expenses will be uniform throughout retirement.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't reflect reality writes Len Reinhart, a financial planner, who says in his column ''Managed Money'' that people who retire seem to go through three distinct stages and that expenses vary during each one.</p>
        <p>''As your clients enter the first phase of later life, they do all the things that you planned for -- they travel, make the gifts they want to make, and try the new hobbies and activities they never had time for when they were working,'' he writes.</p>
        <p>When they fulfill, or get tired of their dreams, ''most settle back into the way of life that made them comfortable in their preretirement years,'' Mr. Reinhart adds.</p>
        <p>And in the final phase, health problems tend to limit activities -- and increase expenses.</p>
        <p>The moral is that investments need to be timed to make sure that people can do what they want during each phase.</p>
        <p>AMERICA FOR SALE -- ''The same Chinese firms that have been crippling American manufacturers with cut-rate goods could soon be viewed in an entirely different light: As sugar daddies,'' Business 2.0 reports this month.</p>
        <p>It turns out that Americans are directly responsible for a possible Chinese buying spree on our shores. ''Because Americans have spent $390 billion more on Chinese goods during the past three years than China has spent on U.S. imports, China is flush with cash,'' Paul Kaihla writes. This year, China could spend as much as $15 billion on overseas acquisitions, says Don Straszheim, the former chief economist for Merrill Lynch. That is triple what it spent from 1979 to 2002.</p>
        <p>The article could not have been more timely; this week alone, there were two big deals. First, the Haier Group, a Chinese manufacturer, moved to acquire Maytag for $1.3 billion, surpassing a bid from a group of American investors. Then the China National Offshore Oil Corporation made a $18.5 billion unsolicited bid for Unocal. The bid comes two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to Chevron for $16.4 billion. The Lenovo Group's $1.75 billion purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer division closed last month.</p>
