        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You urge Congress to ''undo the damage and restore the separation of church and state as a showcase principle'' at the Air Force Academy.</p>
        <p>Sadly, when I offered an amendment in the House Armed Services Committee to do just that, it was criticized by some of my colleagues as ''political correctness.'' One suggested that the wall separating religion and state is ''mythical.'' Later, when I offered a similar amendment to the Rules Committee, it was defeated by a party-line vote.</p>
        <p>These actions suggest that the fault lies not in the Air Force Academy itself; the fault lies in the halls of Congress. That is why I have proposed a bipartisan presidential commission to explore fully how an appropriate balance may be reached between the personal expression of faith and the constitutional separation of religion and state throughout our military.</p>
