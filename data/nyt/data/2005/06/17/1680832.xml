        <p>Goldman Sachs reported a 27 percent decline in second-quarter earnings yesterday, the first time in three years that its quarterly profit fell.</p>
        <p>Earnings were $865 million, or $1.71 a share, compared with $1.19 billion or $2.31 a share in the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>Goldman's results are the latest in what has been a mixed season for investment banks. J.P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley warned that second-quarter earnings would be disappointing, while Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns reported fairly strong quarters.</p>
        <p>''We had three good years where Goldman Sachs beat everyone on the Street every quarter,'' said Brad Hintz, a securities analyst at Sanford Bernstein. ''After a while, you will miss one, and they certainly missed one.''</p>
        <p>While several of Goldman's units reported lower earnings, its trading business was hit the hardest, with revenue down 22 percent from the year-earlier period, to $2.8 billion. Fixed-income trading, which makes up 54 percent of the firm's all trading and principal investment revenue, declined 20 percent, while equity trading rose 6 percent.</p>
        <p>Investment banking, only 17 percent of total revenue, fell 14 percent, to $815 million, but the firm's chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, was bullish about deals in the pipeline, and Mr. Hintz said that helped to drive up the stock. Shares rose $3.46, or 3.5 percent, to $102.65.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hintz suggested that many analysts had expected the results to be worse. ''People didn't know how bad it would be,'' he said. ''There were rumors that prime brokerage and commodities took huge losses.''</p>
        <p>There were bright spots in Goldman's results. Asset management revenue rose 27 percent, to $1.2 billion from $931 million, while revenue in securities services, whose clients include hedge funds, rose 48 percent to $489 million.</p>
        <p>''Given the environment, it was pretty good,'' Mr. Viniar said. ''Many of the businesses were quite strong.''</p>
        <p>Trading results have come to dominate the direction of brokers' earnings. But the last quarter was beset by fairly directionless markets, with fluctuating oil prices and interest rates.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing to us is not the direction in the market but the trends,'' he said. ''When there are trends, they want to transact, and that leads to activity.''</p>
        <p>Goldman's earnings stood in stark contrast to some competitors'. Lehman reported a 13 percent increase in earnings, while profit at Bear Stearns rose 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Viniar said the difference between Goldman's earnings and the two rivals' was simply the varied compositions of the companies --Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns have fixed-income businesses with strong concentrations in mortgage and asset-backed securities, areas that performed well.</p>
        <p>''Lehman is a very good firm. They executed extremely well,'' Mr. Viniar said. ''The biggest difference is a business mix.''</p>
