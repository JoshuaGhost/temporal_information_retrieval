        <p>So much for the homeless-looking character who leads groups of gullible tourists at ground zero, loudly declaiming his completely bogus eyewitness account of the five airplanes that supposedly crashed into the World Trade Center and of the 20,000 people who supposedly died there. (It was two planes, and 2,749 victims.)</p>
        <p>Yesterday, construction began on the Tribute Center, a $3 million visitor center at 120 Liberty Street that will try to provide accurate information about the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and will offer daily public tours of the site by qualified guides.</p>

        <p>So much for the homeless-looking character who leads groups of gullible tourists at ground zero, loudly declaiming his completely bogus eyewitness account of the five airplanes that supposedly crashed into the World Trade Center and of the 20,000 people who supposedly died there. (It was two planes, and 2,749 victims.)</p>
        <p>Yesterday, construction began on the Tribute Center, a $3 million visitor center at 120 Liberty Street that will try to provide accurate information about the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and will offer daily public tours of the site by qualified guides.</p>
        <p>''Right now, millions of people are coming to Lower Manhattan, looking for information about what happened here,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said at a news conference attended by victims' families, rescue workers, survivors and local residents. ''We want people to come here and be told the right story by the right people, who are not trying to make money off it.''</p>
        <p>The center on Liberty Street -- across from the trade center void -- is to occupy 6,000 square feet of space in the vacant storefront once occupied by the Liberty Deli at the bottom two floors of a 12-story building. It will open next March, but in November, the tour program will start, drawing on volunteer docents connected to the events of Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>The center will be paid for primarily by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, along with Deutsche Bank and the American Express Foundation. Its advisers are members of the nonprofit Sept. 11 Widows' and Victims' Families Association.</p>
        <p>''The concept is to take groups and walk around the site and let people ask questions,'' said Lee Ielpi, the organization's vice president and the father of Jonathan Lee Ielpi, a firefighter, who died in the south tower.</p>
        <p>Plans for the center, which has been designed by BKSK Architects, a New York City firm, include educational programs, a gallery and ''exhibitions that will put a human face on what happened on Sept. 11,'' said Sally Yerkovich, the center's president.</p>
        <p>The governor also announced the construction of a recording booth in the nearby World Trade Center PATH station that will collect audio reminiscences from Sept. 11 family members, friends, survivors, visitors and rescue workers about the trade center attacks of 2001 and 1993.</p>
        <p>The booth, to be opened on July 12, will be managed by StoryCorps, an oral-history project that hopes to record thousands of interviews that will be donated the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The development corporation has provided $500,000 in financing.</p>
