        <p>The bikers will be at Braeburn Lodge for the Midnight Sun Bun Run, the highlight of the inaugural Ride Yukon rally weekend -- one of several events in the Yukon and Northwest Territories that celebrate the long, long summer days of the Far North.

        <p>BIKERS from all over North America will roll their hogs into the Braeburn Lodge truck stop at Mile 55 of the Klondike Highway just minutes after midnight on June 25. It'll be the wee hours in the Yukon Territory, but headlights probably won't be necessary, and if the northern daylight isn't enough to keep the locals awake, the sound of 500 revving engines will.</p>
        <p>The bikers will be at Braeburn Lodge for the Midnight Sun Bun Run, the highlight of the inaugural Ride Yukon rally weekend -- one of several events in the Yukon and Northwest Territories that celebrate the long, long summer days of the Far North. This year the festivities include softball, fun runs and a motorcycle rally with gigantic cinnamon buns. They may not be what the Klondike poet Robert W. Service meant when he wrote of strange things done under the midnight sun, but they could qualify.</p>
        <p>The Braeburn Lodge truck stop, for example, is famous throughout the North for its huge, fresh-baked cinnamon buns. The diner's manager, Leigh Knox, delivers a tray of the one-pound wonders to the front counter. Drizzled with icing and cinnamon, they vaguely resemble the area's mountains in winter. In the summer, sales average more than 200 a day, at $6.50 a pop.</p>
        <p>''People always ask, does anyone finish one of those?'' Ms. Knox said. ''Yes, but not the people you'd expect. Little slim trim athletes that are bicycling from San Francisco to Inuvik, they'll eat a whole one of those and then zoom up the highway.''</p>
        <p>For those who live in or visit the country above the 60th parallel, there are plenty of reasons to stay up late for several weeks before and after the summer solstice, which occurs in the Yukon at 11:46 p.m. on Monday. You can read a book outside while enjoying the calls of loons or songbirds at 1 a.m., and the summer heat and swarms of mosquitoes have yet to arrive in the southern Yukon. The many placid rivers and lakes, their banks dotted with spruce, poplar and alder trees, beckon.</p>
        <p>One summertime classic is the Yukon River Quest, a canoe and kayak endurance race down the Yukon River from Whitehorse to Dawson City from June 29 to July 3. The 486-mile route is the same one that rafts and paddlewheelers plied during the Klondike gold rush.</p>
        <p>About 2,000 people live year-round in Dawson City, but it was once a major city with 30,000 residents. Locals welcome summer atop 2,911-foot Midnight Dome with an all-night party that begins around 11 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 hours after the actual solstice. It's a two-hour hike or a pleasant drive to the summit, where midnight sun worshippers will watch the sun circle the sky without dipping below the horizon. Gazing down at the gold fields, one can imagine the thousands of prospectors moiling for gold under the midnight sun.</p>
        <p>There's north, and then there's all the way north. The Dempster Highway, a 457-mile, two-lane gravel road that starts 25 miles east of Dawson City, crosses the Arctic Circle at Mile 252 and finishes at Inuvik, Northwest Territories. Along its length there are three river crossings by ferry and thousands of moose, wolverines, caribou, foxes, musk ox and ravens, but few humans. Yet a good percentage of the ferries in mid-June are carloads of slo-pitch softball teams and distance runners.</p>
        <p>They're headed to Inuvik on the vast Mackenzie River delta. Tomorrow, Inuvik, the biggest town in the region, with a population of 3,300, will be the site of the Midnight Sun 5-kilometer, 10k and half-marathon runs -- a preview for the Canada Day triathlon on July 1, which is the local highlight of national day celebrations (the sky is too bright for fireworks).</p>
        <p>The Inuvik ballpark is abuzz beyond 1 a.m. for tournaments this weekend and July 1 to 3 as co-ed softball players prepare for Inuvik's Northwest Territories Summer Games, July 8 to 10. Outfielders must wear sunglasses when they're going for fly balls because of the way the midnight sun glints off the high school's metallic roof.</p>
        <p>In six months, Inuvik will be shrouded in 24-hour darkness, so it's not just visitors who revel in the constant daylight. ''A lot of people will stay up all night and sleep till noon if they don't have to go to work the next day,'' said Kristen Wenghofer, who manages the community greenhouse inside Inuvik's old hockey rink. ''In the summer, life doesn't start until around noon in Inuvik.''</p>
