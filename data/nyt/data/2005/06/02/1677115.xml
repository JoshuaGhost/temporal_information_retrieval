        <p>For the seventh week in a row, a new album has entered the Billboard charts at No.1. Not since 50 Cent's ''Massacre'' (Interscope) ended its six-week run in April has any new album stayed at the top for more than seven days. This week's chart is led by Audioslave's ''Out of Exile'' (Interscope/Epic), which sold 263,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In a relatively strong week of sales, the rapper Common's new album, ''Be'' (Geffen), left, entered at No.2 with 185,00 copies sold, and last week's No.1, System of a Down's ''Mezmerize'' (American/Columbia), dropped to No. 4, with a 63 percent sales slide, to 169,000 units. Meanwhile, Mariah Carey's ''Emancipation of Mimi'' (Island/Def Jam) is proving a durable hit, holding at No.3 in its seventh week of release. Coldplay's ''X&amp;Y,'' to be released on Tuesday, is expected to be a summer hit, but sales may be jeopardized by an Internet leak. The BBC reported that an unauthorized version appeared online on Monday, just before it was to be sent to British radio stations and sold in Japan.</p>
