        <p>The Oracle Corporation, the software company, reported on Wednesday fourth-quarter profits that were slightly higher than expected, even as it completed its integration with PeopleSoft, the rival software company it acquired in December.</p>
        <p>While the company had strong growth in its flagship database business, Oracle also showed surprisingly brisk sales of application software, which is used to automate business tasks, with sales surpassing Wall Street's expectations.</p>
        <p>''We thought the quarter was fantastic, considering how much we had going on,'' Charles E. Phillips, Oracle's co-president, said in an interview. ''To have both the application and infrastructure businesses accelerate,'' he said, is an indication that the acquisition of PeopleSoft is ''helping our entire business.''</p>
        <p>Oracle's profits rose 3 percent to $1.02 billion, or 20 cents a share, from $990 million a year earlier, or 19 cents a share. Total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31, increased to $3.88 billion from $3.08 billion a year ago.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the company said it would have continued strong performance. It expects to earn 14 cents a share in the current quarter, compared with 10 cents a share a year ago. For fiscal 2006, which ends next May, the company raised its revenue estimate to $14.2 billion to $14.4 billion, and raised its earnings forecast to 78 cents to 81 cents a share, from its earlier forecast of 64 cents to 65 cents a share.</p>
        <p>The fourth quarter was the first full quarter since Oracle's $10.3 billion acquisition of PeopleSoft. Excluding certain expenses, including costs related to integrating PeopleSoft's sales force with Oracle's, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.36 billion, or 26 cents a share, up from 19 cents a share in the same quarter last year; the figure was 3 cents higher than analysts' expectations.</p>
        <p>In addressing widespread speculation about Oracle's making another big acquisition, Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, told analysts on a conference call Wednesday that the company would carefully evaluate future acquisitions for their effects on Oracle's plans for growth, giving no specifics about possible takeover targets.</p>
        <p>In March, Oracle won a bidding war with SAP, the German software giant, to acquire Retek, which makes software to help retail chains manage their operations. The price was $631 million for Retek, which had sales of $174.2 million last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellison said, ''We have no plans to buy anything that doesn't contribute to our long-term strategy and profit margins of 20 percent per year over the next five years.''</p>
        <p>The company's software sales in the fourth quarter climbed 24 percent, to $3.12 billion, from $2.52 billion for the period a year ago. New license revenue for database programs grew 16 percent, to $1.26 billion, while new license revenue for applications software jumped 52 percent, to $350 million.</p>
        <p>''This is the first quarter in a while where we've had both good database and good application growth,'' said David M. Hilal, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, who has a buy rating on Oracle. ''That was nice to see for a change.''</p>
        <p>Safra A. Catz, Oracle's co-president and interim chief finance officer, said the absorption of PeopleSoft's business was now complete. Oracle's work force is now nearly 50,000 employees, up from roughly 45,000 before the merger.</p>
        <p>Last week, the company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., announced it had hired Gregory B. Maffei, a former Microsoft executive known for aggressive deal making, as Oracle's chief finance officer and co-president. That hiring led some analysts to speculate that Oracle was interested in seeking new acquisitions in the near term.</p>
        <p>Oracle's earnings report was issued before the market opened. Shares in Oracle rose 74 cents to close at $13.57 on Wednesday.</p>
