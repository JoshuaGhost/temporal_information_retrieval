        <p>A Brooklyn man who the police said stabbed an off-duty police officer in a struggle captured on videotape at a Dunkin' Donuts shop on Monday was arrested yesterday at his brother's home in Virginia, a police spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The police identified the suspect as Shron Killings, 22, of 451 Kingston Avenue in Brooklyn. New York City police detectives, accompanied by local officers, caught up to Mr. Killings yesterday evening in Newport News, Va., said Paul J.

        <p>A Brooklyn man who the police said stabbed an off-duty police officer in a struggle captured on videotape at a Dunkin' Donuts shop on Monday was arrested yesterday at his brother's home in Virginia, a police spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The police identified the suspect as Shron Killings, 22, of 451 Kingston Avenue in Brooklyn. New York City police detectives, accompanied by local officers, caught up to Mr. Killings yesterday evening in Newport News, Va., said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's deputy commissioner of public information.</p>
        <p>When the police arrived at the front door, Mr. Killings tried to flee out a rear window but was captured, Mr. Browne said.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, a young man in a Yankees cap, whom the police later identified as Mr. Killings, was captured on surveillance video at a Dunkin' Donuts shop on Empire Boulevard in Brooklyn, first putting a dollar on the counter, then looking over his shoulder several times. He then lunged at a clerk with a knife and unsuccessfully swiped at an open cash register.</p>
        <p>Officer Vincent A. Schiavarelli, 24, who was on his way to work but not in uniform, was waiting to be served. He grabbed the man but was stabbed in a melee that could be seen on a jerky videotape shown later to reporters. The tape showed the man breaking free and Officer Schiavarelli chasing him out of the store, only to double over, apparently in pain.</p>
        <p>The police believe Mr. Killings robbed the same store on May 17 with the help of an accomplice, getting away with $300, and another Dunkin' Donuts shop on May 25, where they said he stole $400.</p>
        <p>Officer Schiavarelli, who has been on the force for two years, was discharged yesterday afternoon from the hospital and was resting at his home in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Relatives described his wound as superficial.</p>
        <p>Kathy Schiavarelli, his mother, said in an interview in front of the home yesterday evening that she was proud of him.</p>
        <p>''He did what he was trained to do and acted spontaneously,'' Ms. Schiavarelli said.</p>
