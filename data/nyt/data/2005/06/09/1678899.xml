        <p>A small bomb went off on the outskirts of Jakarta, outside the house of an Indonesian preacher suspected of being a leading member of the radical Islamic organization Jemaah Islamiyah, and the police say they think it may have been planted by disgruntled neighbors. There were no reported injuries. ''His neighbors didn't really like him because of some religious activities he's been conducting at the house,'' said Jakarta's police chief, Firman Gani. The preacher, called Abu Jibril and also known as Mohamad Iqbal Abdul Rahman, has been identified by the Malaysian police as one of Jemaah Islamiyah's top three leaders and by the State Department as its primary recruiter.</p>
