        <p>A showdown between the New York City Council and the Campaign Finance Board was averted yesterday when the Council shelved plans to overrule a recent board ruling that would have restricted unions' campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>One provision of the board's new rules would have deemed contributions from different local chapters of the same union to be from the same source, and counted together against the limit on donations from single organizations.</p>
        <p>Union leaders said they felt that those rules would have imposed entirely new restrictions on labor's political activity and pushed for legislation to overturn the rule.</p>
        <p>Neither side appeared willing to budge until Monday, when the board voted to delay its new rule until after the November elections. In turn, the bill to overrule the board was withdrawn from the schedule for yesterday's Council meeting, said Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for Council Speaker Gifford Miller.</p>
        <p>''The speaker's office worked hard with the sponsoring council members and all of the relevant parties and decided that since the C.F.B. had taken a substantial step in the right direction, that we would re-evaluate the time frame and the need for the legislation,'' Mr. Sigmund said.</p>
        <p>Labor lobbyists had been pushing for passage of the bill despite the board's postponement. But at an emergency meeting on Tuesday evening with Mr. Miller and Councilman Bill de Blasio, one of the bill's chief sponsors, most agreed to support the delay provided the Council takes up the matter again after the election if the negotiations with the board do not resolve it.</p>
        <p>Postponing the vote allowed Mr. Miller to steer clear of what would have been a difficult choice. Blocking the bill would have disappointed the unions, whose support he needs in his campaign for mayor, but pushing for it would leave him open to criticism that he was weakening the board's authority to his own advantage.</p>
