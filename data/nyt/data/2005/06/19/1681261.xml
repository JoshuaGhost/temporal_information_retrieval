        <p>There is no set career path for a knife thrower's target. Ekaterina Sknarina's involved the Russian national rhythmic gymnastics team and several years in Cirque du Soleil. She has been performing for the last three or so years with the Great Throwdini, aka David R. Adamovich of Freeport, N.Y., a master of the impalement arts whose entertainment career stretches back to a stint as an acrobat at the 1964 World's Fair. Since June 13, Throwdini and Target Girl, who has her own dance and flexibility act, have been among the headliners of ''Maximum Risk,'' a classically styled vaudeville/sideshow revue, on Monday nights at the Soho Playhouse (www.sohoplayhouse.com; Mr. Adamovich's personal site is www.knifethrower.com). To deliver on the promise of the show's title, performers try to break or create a new world's record each week; on June 27, Throwdini will try to throw 120 knives in 60 seconds at Target Girl. (The current record is 77.) Recently, Greg Allen spoke with Ms. Sknarina, who lives in Queens, about her job and what makes a good target girl.</p>
        <p>Is targeting very competitive?</p>
        <p>Oh, no. It's a very close group of people, and there's no competition. I started in rhythmic gymnastics, I was really into it, and in Russia it is so competitive. Targeting's not like that, though. It's a very nice community.</p>
        <p>How's the money?</p>
        <p>It's really hard making a living being a target girl. I have my act, which is a little dancy, and a little contortion, and a little rhythmic gymnastics. There's one girl who does a bed of machetes act; she's at Equinox -- a personal trainer. And the other girl [in ''Maximum Risk''], she doesn't have her own act, she just does the targeting. She's a jewelry designer, actually, who just does it for fun.</p>
        <p>What does it take to be a good target girl?</p>
        <p>It all builds on trust. As long as you trust a person to throw a knife around you, you'll be fine. He has a Web site, and you'd be surprised how many girls e-mail him, saying, ''Can I please be your assistant?'' But he prefers someone who's already been with some shows, who knows how that works, and who realizes it's all about him, and it's his act, not someone who just wants to be in the spotlight.</p>
        <p>What goes through your mind when you're up there?</p>
        <p>The first few shows, I was nervous, and I was like, ''Don't miss!'' But it was kind of a rush. Now I've gotten used to it. Actually, you can explain the whole thing from a mathematical and physics point of view, and it's a very, very small chance to actually be stabbed.</p>
