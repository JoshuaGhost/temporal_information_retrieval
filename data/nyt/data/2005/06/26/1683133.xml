        <p>A Brooklyn man died Friday night after he was stabbed in the neck, and on Staten Island a man standing in front of a deli was killed early yesterday after he was shot by a man in a moving car, the police said.</p>
        <p>No one was arrested yesterday afternoon in either killing, and the motives had not been determined, the police said.</p>
        <p>They said that around 10 p.m. on Friday, Francisco Quiles, 27, was found on Rugby Road in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, bleeding heavily from a single stab wound to his neck. He was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>The police said that a light-colored two-door hatchback with a rear spoiler was seen driving from the scene and that the victim's car was found nearby.</p>
        <p>On Staten Island around 3:30 a.m. yesterday, a man in a moving car fired four shots at John Chase, 26, of Warren Street, as he stood in front of a deli at 202 Gordon Street, across the street from the Stapleton Houses project, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chase was hit once in his right eye. The car carrying the gunman drove away.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Chase was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital Staten Island, where he was pronounced dead soon after the attack.</p>
