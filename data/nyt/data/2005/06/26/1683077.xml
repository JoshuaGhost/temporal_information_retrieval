        <p>IN the investment world, money chases whatever is hot. These days, that often means real estate.</p>
        <p>A study released in March by the National Association of Realtors found that nearly one in four homes bought in 2004 was acquired not to live in, but for investment purposes. Throw in vacation homes, and the figure jumps to more than one in three.</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder that investors would turn to real estate, when in the Northeast alone, home prices through May rose more than 60 percent since the start of 2002? That is about six times the gain of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks. But before you make the leap from homeowner to real estate investor, ask yourself a question: Do I already have some exposure to real estate through my stock portfolio?</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom says basic equity portfolios don't offer investors much of a real estate stake -- commercial or residential. After all, real estate investment trusts, generally companies that own commercial properties, were admitted into the S.&amp;P. 500 less than four years ago. And David Blitzer, chairman of S.&amp;P.'s index committee, notes that the seven REIT's in the index make up less than 1 percent of its market capitalization.</p>
        <p>But Andrew Clark, senior research analyst at Lipper, the mutual fund tracker, points out that ''there are other industries and sectors which play a role in real estate'' and therefore offer some indirect exposure. Among them are homebuilders, engineering businesses, building-products makers and home-improvement retailers -- even regional banks and other lenders that do a decent amount of work in mortgage lending.</p>
        <p>When you throw in indirect real estate plays like these, Lipper found that more than 4 percent of the holdings of the average large-capitalization core stock fund were at least indirectly tied to real estate. Among midcap value-oriented funds, the figure is greater than 13 percent. And among small-cap value funds, it is nearly 17 percent. ''The biggest exposure is clearly in small-cap stocks,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Some diversified stock funds have at least 20 percent exposure, direct or indirect, to real estate, according to Lipper. Nearly a third of the assets of the Alpine Dynamic Balance fund, for example, are tied in some way to the real estate market, according to Lipper. For the Hotchkis and Wiley All Cap Value fund, the recent number was 36 percent, Lipper said.</p>
        <p>In both cases, that's more exposure than the average stock fund has to technology or energy stocks. ''Most fund investors don't look, therefore they don't know how much real estate their funds own,'' said Mike Scarborough, president of the Scarborough Group, an investment advisory business based in Annapolis, Md.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scarborough argues that while some fund managers are in real estate for diversification purposes, some are ''also seeing a need to juice their returns.''</p>
        <p>In the 90's, some funds did that with tech stocks. Today, it may be real estate. Over the last five years, shares of homebuilding companies are up more than 50 percent, annualized, while REIT's have delivered average total returns of more than 20 percent a year. By comparison, the S.&amp;P. 500 is down 2 percent, annualized, during this stretch.</p>
        <p>Sam Lieber, a co-manager of the Alpine Dynamic Balance fund, said that ''everybody looks in the rear-view mirror to some degree, so we've seen folks get much more exposure to real estate than they used to.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lieber, who is also chief executive of Alpine Management &amp; Research, argues that even if the housing market slows, there is a reason to be invested in some of these stocks.</p>
        <p>The homebuilding industry, for example, is going through a fundamental shift from a patchwork of mom-and-pop regional businesses to large national players, he said. Even if home prices start to flatten, as Mr. Lieber expects over the next several years, he says he thinks that larger homebuilders like Toll Brothers and KB Home will continue to grow by picking up market share.</p>
        <p>The Muhlenkamp fund recently held more than 18 percent of its stake in homebuilder shares, according to Lipper. But its manager, Ron Muhlenkamp, says that ''we're not invested in real estate; we are invested in home-building stocks.'' This is an important distinction, he said, because he doesn't base his assessment of these investments on the future direction of home prices but rather on the stocks' fundamentals.</p>
        <p>The earnings of many of these companies have tripled in recent years, Mr. Muhlenkamp said, so they still trade at around eight times estimated 2005 earnings, despite a run-up in share price. ''Frankly, when we see companies with returns on equity of 20 percent or more selling at eight times earnings, we'd be very, very interested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>TO be certain, these funds are all indirect plays. These diversified funds will never give investors the type of concentrated real estate exposure provided by a specialty portfolio like Fidelity Select Construction and Housing. Nor will they give investors a stake in residential real estate, the way funds run by Redbrick Partners do. Those funds, which are closed to new investors, buy single-family homes for both rental income and capital appreciation.</p>
        <p>Some managers with large indirect stakes in real estate-oriented stocks argue that concerns about a housing bubble are misplaced. ''The whole argument that people's homes are at risk -- regarding homes as if they were a pile of Cisco stock -- has no basis in reality,'' said Robert Markman, manager of the Markman Total Return Core stock fund, which recently held 28.5 percent of its assets in real estate plays, direct and indirect.</p>
        <p>Still, Brian Jones, vice president of Cooper, Jones &amp; McLeland, a financial planning and wealth management firm in Fairfax, Va., says that it ''would freak me out'' if his diversified stock funds held a third or more of their stakes in real estate plays.</p>
        <p>''It's the winning horse right now,'' Mr. Jones said. But that won't last forever. At the very least, he warned, ''you can't load up on this stuff.''</p>
