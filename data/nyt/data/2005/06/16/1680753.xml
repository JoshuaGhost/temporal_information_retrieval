        <p>THORNTON--John V. The New York Law School community mourns the passing of John V. Thornton, former chairman of the Board of Trustees who led our school through one of its most transformative periods in the 1970's and 1980's. Mr. Thornton contributed his considerable talents and keen intellect to all areas of our profession as a practitioner, educator, academic administrator, judge, and public servant. He left an indelible mark on the many academic institutions and other non profits which he served. Our community is particularly grateful to have benefited from his wise counsel and guidance for more than 3 decades. We extend our condolences to his wife Edna, his son John, and his daughters Nancy, Sarah, Amy, and Laura. Arthur N. Abbey '59 Chairman of the Board of Trustees Richard A. Matasar Dean and President</p>
