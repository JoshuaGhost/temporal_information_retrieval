        <p>Dr. Susan Bernofsky, a college professor and literary translator, and Don Byron, the clarinetist, composer and arranger, were married last evening in Mount Tremper, N.Y. The Rev. Dr. Linda Anderson, a Unitarian Universalist minister, officiated at La Duchesse Anne, an inn.</p>
        <p>The bride, 38, was until last month an assistant professor of German at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.

She has also received a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies to write a book about the Swiss-German novelist and short story writer Robert Walser, whose works she has translated into English, along with those of Gregor von Rezzori and Jenny Erpenbeck.</p>
        <p>The bride graduated from Johns Hopkins University and received a master's degree in fiction writing from Washington University and a doctorate in comparative literature from Princeton. She is a daughter of Shirley Bernofsky and Dr. Carl Bernofsky of New Orleans. The bride's father retired as a research biochemist at the Tulane University School of Medicine.

        <p>The bridegroom is 46. His latest album is ''Ivey-Divey'' (Blue Note, 2004) in which he explores the music of Lester Young. His albums since his debut in 1992 have incorporated classical, salsa, hip-hop, funk, klezmer, and jazz styles including swing, bop and downtown improvisation. This fall he is to become a visiting associate professor of music at the State University at Albany. Until April, Mr. Byron was an artist in residence at Symphony Space in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music. He is the son of Donald E. Byron of the Bronx and the late Daisy A. Byron. The bridegroom's father, who is retired, was a letter carrier for the Postal Service in Manhattan and also a bassist who played jazz and calypso music in and around New York City.
