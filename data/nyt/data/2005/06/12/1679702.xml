        <p>The Hope Creek nuclear reactor, one of three reactors at the Salem nuclear power plant, shut down last Tuesday afternoon after operators in the control room detected a water leak inside the reactor building. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that the leak was detected at 2:13 p.m. and that there was no radiation release or danger to the public. It was the fourth time the reactor had shut because of leaks in the last 12 months, a spokesman for the plant operator said. The cause of the leak was under investigation.</p>
