        <p>While in Japan to shoot ''Lost in Translation,'' the cinematographer Lance Acord was taken with the stripped-down, post-and-beam architecture of traditional country homes. Back in Hollywood, he realized that an abstract painting hanging in his bedroom shared the same aesthetic. He had just bought a weekend house near Malibu that he intended to tear down; it seemed only logical to him to commission the painter, his friend Cannon Hudson, to replace it.</p>
        <p>That logic might not be obvious to everyone. But Mr. Hudson did have construction experience, on a smaller scale: in the early 1990's, after graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, he was charged with building a painting studio for the artist Richard Artschwager, and he had worked with a contractor to convert a garage at Mr. Acord's Hollywood home into a master bedroom. He readily accepted the promotion to architect. ''I'm one of those people who feels that given a problem, I can solve it,'' he said, speaking from his studio in Joshua Tree, Calif.</p>
        <p>Recent canvases by Mr. Hudson, like ''Horizon,'' the one Mr. Acord owns, and ''Plank'' (pictured), actually represent construction materials like wood, glass and tile, and they certainly suggest interior spaces. ''The qualities of the building are the same as those I applied to the paintings,'' Mr. Hudson said. ''And the pictures were assembled like the house,'' a modest affair of redwood and cement, with a large deck and built-in koi ponds outside one of the two bedrooms. Was Mr. Acord worried about entrusting an abstract painter with the design of his house? ''Cannon and I have known each other since we were 13,'' Mr. Acord said. ''He's always been an amazing draftsman.'' What's more, he added, it's not as if they had to build the house from scratch: ''It was torn down to the studs, but the bones were there. It was just a matter of reapplying them.''</p>
        <p>Which is where Mr. Hudson's paintings came in handy. ''The way the floor is put together and the way the beams intersect with the walls, the pink tile patterns in the bathrooms and the proportions of the materials all reflect the floating planes in my paintings,'' he said. Which meant the job wasn't all that great a stretch. ''As long as I moved cautiously,'' he said, ''I thought everything would be O.K.'' Mr. Acord, meanwhile, already has his eye on his next house, to be built in Joshua Tree. Mr. Hudson is at work on the drawings.</p>
