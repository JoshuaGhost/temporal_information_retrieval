        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York Times's grotesque and chilling disrespect for the sanctity of life has never been more apparent than in your June 16 editorial ''Autopsy on the Schiavo Tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Terri Schiavo was a deeply loved daughter, wife, sister and friend. The fact that her brain was atrophied or that she was blind or could not have been rehabilitated doesn't change that fact.</p>
        <p>While many medical professionals said she was in a persistent vegetative state, still other highly respected neurologists said there was a chance that she was not.</p>
        <p>In cases where patients do not have an expressed written directive regarding end-of-life decisions and where the patient's guardian has a conflict of interest, it only makes sense to err on the side of life.</p>
        <p>Terri's life and her death remind us all that life is fragile and must be valued.</p>
        <p>Despite claims of cynicism and being ''agenda-driven,'' we will continue to strive to protect our most vulnerable citizens. All innocent human life is precious, and government has a duty to protect the weak, the disabled and the vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Jeb Bush  Governor  Tallahassee, Fla., June 17, 2005</p>
