        <p>Up and down First Avenue in Midtown yesterday, paces from the scene of a chaotic water rescue, teenagers played basketball and commuters rushed to trains. On a pier by the United Nations, a small cluster of the curious peered out at the East River, and down by 34th Street, a few people with waterfront apartments took to their expensive balconies.</p>
        <p>If ever a helicopter could crash into a river in a teeming metropolis without causing a stir, yesterday was the day for it. Cut off from the Manhattan grid by the clogged lanes of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the scene of the crash did not lend itself to gathering and gawking.</p>

        <p>Up and down First Avenue in Midtown yesterday, paces from the scene of a chaotic water rescue, teenagers played basketball and commuters rushed to trains. On a pier by the United Nations, a small cluster of the curious peered out at the East River, and down by 34th Street, a few people with waterfront apartments took to their expensive balconies.</p>
        <p>If ever a helicopter could crash into a river in a teeming metropolis without causing a stir, yesterday was the day for it. Cut off from the Manhattan grid by the clogged lanes of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the scene of the crash did not lend itself to gathering and gawking.</p>
        <p>And besides, even to Deputy Inspector Joseph A. Gallucci, a veteran of the New York Police Department, it sounded like a gag. Just three days before the report came across the radio, Inspector Gallucci, commanding officer of the aviation unit, had directed officers who helped pull passengers from a downed helicopter in the East River. Now he was on duty at a base in Gramercy Park when a voice on the radio began describing suspiciously similar circumstances.</p>
        <p>''They were both taking off from a heliport,'' Inspector Gallucci said. ''They both went in the drink.''</p>
        <p>At first, he was skeptical.</p>
        <p>''What are the odds?'' he recalled thinking yesterday, after the rescue was done. It was not a question he considered long.</p>
        <p>''You need to get there,'' he said. ''If it turns out to be an unfounded job, we'll find out when we get there.''</p>
        <p>By the time he got there, New York had already responded with its usual blend of nonchalance and self-sacrifice. The undisturbed bustle of city life on the west side of the highway made a neat contrast with the scene unfolding on the east.</p>
        <p>''It's just chaotic,'' said Lt. Danny Deangelis of the Emergency Service Unit. ''Everybody's responding at once.''</p>
        <p>As the helicopter began to drift north, a uniformed officer chased it along the sea wall, running to keep up and radioing for help, said Paul J. Browne, the chief police spokesman.</p>
        <p>A party boat called the Half Moon, described in promotional materials as fit for ''holiday parties, birthday parties, high school proms, and dance parties up to 200 people,'' happened by and pulled two people out of the water, Mr. Browne said.</p>
        <p>Police officers were showing up, too, including many who had missed the Tuesday rescue. Officer William Chartieo, a launch pilot for the Harbor Unit who had been on desk duty on Tuesday, was fighting the current.</p>
        <p>''I saw the terrified faces of the people holding onto the sea wall,'' Officer Chartieo said. ''My main concern was not to put the boat against the sea wall and crush the bodies.''</p>
        <p>People on the street joined boaters in throwing life jackets to the helicopter passengers clinging to the pieces of the craft, Mr. Browne said. Where did they get life jackets? he was asked.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea,'' Mr. Browne said, adding something about this being New York City.</p>
        <p>A FreshDirect deliveryman named Miguel Lopez dived into the water to help, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, adding that Mr. Lopez declined to stay around to talk about the excitement.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'I've got to get back to work,''' Mr. Kelly said.</p>
