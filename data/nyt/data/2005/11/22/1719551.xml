        <p>Re ''Before Memoirs, He Wrote A's, B's, C's, D's and F's'' (news article, Nov. 16):</p>
        <p>Frank McCourt's stories about his life made him an unforgettable teacher. Now he has written about them in his new memoir, ''Teacher Man.''</p>
        <p>Growing up as the daughter of uneducated Eastern European immigrants, I was no stranger to hopelessness, poverty and shame. While at Stuyvesant High School in New York City (class of 1983), I learned from Mr. McCourt that every life story is worth telling long before I learned from feminism that the personal is political.</p>

        <p>Frank McCourt's stories about his life made him an unforgettable teacher. Now he has written about them in his new memoir, ''Teacher Man.''</p>
        <p>Growing up as the daughter of uneducated Eastern European immigrants, I was no stranger to hopelessness, poverty and shame. While at Stuyvesant High School in New York City (class of 1983), I learned from Mr. McCourt that every life story is worth telling long before I learned from feminism that the personal is political.</p>
        <p>I later aspired to become a teacher because of Mr. McCourt's unorthodox pedagogical style, and I remain one today because of his books.</p>
        <p>I first heard about ''Angela's Ashes'' in a hospital bed while recovering from cancer. Since then, I have taught many college students how to write and perform personal narratives. I cannot think of better ways to learn self-affirmation.</p>
        <p>I owe a great deal both personally and professionally to my former teacher, Mr. Frank McCourt.</p>
