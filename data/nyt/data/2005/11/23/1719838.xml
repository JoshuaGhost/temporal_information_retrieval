        <p>Re ''Harvard, for Less: Extension Courses' New Allure'' (front page, Nov. 18):</p>
        <p>Rather than belittling extension schools for their perceived mediocre standing or for tarnishing the brand of elite universities to which they are attached, it would have been far more challenging for you to have addressed how these schools provide the tangible assets of career-focused education, where quality-based learning outcomes define the classroom experience and student satisfaction may be measured not by students' ability to secure discounted tuition, but by the quality of their preparation to advance in their chosen fields.</p>
        <p>For this reason, schools of continuing education appeal not only to working adults or younger bargain-hunters, but increasingly have become the pathway of choice nationally for community college graduates who are seeking their baccalaureate degrees and preparation for success in the working world.</p>
