        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Lorraine Adams, in her lukewarm review of Ismail Kadare's ''Successor'' (Nov. 13), which I translated from the French, surmises that one day an archive may turn up that will reveal the truth about the novelist's position in Hoxha's Albania. That archive has not only been discovered, it was published this year by Shaban Sinani, director of the National Archives in Tirana.</p>
        <p>This ''file on K.'' includes the denunciations supplied by named individuals to the sigurimi, the secret state police of the Hoxha era, as well as internal documents from the archives of the Party of Labor. Many of these denunciations were penned by Kadare's colleagues in the Albanian Writers Union. The volume and the vitriolic nastiness of the material make it clear, once and for all, that Kadare was at permanent risk of arrest, relegation or worse throughout the Hoxha years.</p>
        <p>If he was a tolerated house novelist, as some have said, then he certainly wasn't thought to be so by those who were in the best position to know. Thanks to Sinani's book, the longstanding calumnies accusing Kadare of compromise and collusion with the regime can now be seen to be fabrications.</p>
