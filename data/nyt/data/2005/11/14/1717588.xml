        <p>As former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, walked into the bombed-out ballroom of the Radisson SAS Hotel here Sunday night, the sound of broken water glasses and chandelier shards could be heard crunching beneath their feet. The walls were pockmarked with holes from the nails and ball bearings that had been packed into the bomb to make it deadlier.</p>
        <p>Then, at Jordan Hospital and Medical Center, they visited some of the survivors of last week's suicide bombings in three hotels here, which killed 57.</p>
        <p>The Clintons, along with their daughter, Chelsea, paid an unannounced visit here on Sunday night to see the damage firsthand and to express their sympathies to King Abdullah II and Queen Rania.</p>
        <p>At the hospital, Mr. Clinton played with Ammar Abdel Rahim Keilani, a 4-year-old boy who has not spoken since a piece of shrapnel entered his head during the bombing. The boy sat silently in his bed, clutching a toy Hummer and spinning its rear wheel.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton bent over a 3-month-old baby girl, Tulin Samer, whose tiny, fractured right arm was wrapped in a bandage. The senator elicited several wide yawns and what looked like a smile.</p>
        <p>''This horrible, destructive, evil act should be condemned by all people, everywhere,'' Mrs. Clinton said in the ballroom of the Radisson, which was attacked on Wednesday during a wedding. ''At the moments when all people should be respectful, these people have no respect for anyone or anything. They believe in death and nihilism. And I just hope that all people, humanity, will work to destroy this network of terrorism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the terrorists who waged the attacks believed that everyone who did not agree with them must die. And he called on people to take a stand against them.</p>
        <p>''You have a king who brought in the leaders of all the major, historically recognized schools of Muslim theology and thought,'' he noted, ''and they all talked about how they read the Koran, how they thought about the rules of life, how people live their faith in daily life. And every single one of them, all these academics and scholars and religious people who came here said, 'Our faith does not sanction terror.' ''</p>
        <p>After the Clintons made their way through the ballroom, stepping past forks and the odd butter knife on the floor, and over a red carpet covered with plaster from the ceiling, they stopped to speak with the hotel's general manager, Sami Ansari.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ansari said he was grateful for the Clintons' visit. ''Their trip has done so much, it's so uplifting,'' he said. ''It has done so much for morale, not just for us at the hotel, but for the entire country.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Ansari and other managers of the hotel asked for a picture with the Clintons, Mr. Clinton invited all the employees to join them, and they were soon surrounded by young men in suits with metal name tags on their chests.</p>
        <p>The tour of the devastation in Amman came at the end of the Clintons' second day in their tour of the Middle East, a day that Mrs. Clinton devoted largely to issues of terrorism and security.</p>
        <p>She began her day touring a portion of the barrier that Israel built between Bethlehem and Gilo, a Jewish area on the southern edge of Jerusalem built on land that Israel captured in the 1967 war. Palestinians describe it as a settlement, because it is built on West Bank land they are seeking for a future state.</p>
        <p>Standing on a chalky hill overlooking the valley between Bethlehem and Gilo, and the concrete barrier, with guard posts, that now stands between them, Mrs. Clinton heard from Israeli officials how guns were fired across the valley into Gilo, prompting its residents to stay in the rear rooms of their apartments, away from windows facing the valley. She praised the barrier, which Israel says it needs for security.</p>
        <p>''The primary responsibility of any government is to protect its citizens,'' she said. ''That is the No. 1 priority. And after trying many things, it became necessary to pursue the security fence, and I understand that, and support it.''</p>
        <p>But asked if she supported Israel's efforts to build portions of the barrier within the West Bank, to surround Israeli settlements, Mrs. Clinton answered only vaguely. An aide said later that Mrs. Clinton had not taken a position on exactly where the barrier should stand.</p>
        <p>Before leaving for Amman, Mrs. Clinton met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in his office and discussed security issues, including Iran's sponsorship of terrorism, aides said. Mrs. Clinton praised the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Gaza as ''courageous.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton got a number of friendly questions from Israeli reporters in Gilo. One asked, ''Why are you so loved by the Israeli public?''</p>
        <p>Another asked: ''Will this help your trip to the White House?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton replied, ''Oh, I've been there before.''</p>
