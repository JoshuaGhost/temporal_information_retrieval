        <p>The Bath Institution is a long way from Alcatraz.</p>
        <p>It is a medium-security federal prison, and its inmates are allowed to keep the keys to their cells. Many have their own kitchens, and they move freely from the gym to the cabinet-making shop. Drug addicts can clean their needles with bleach, and condoms are readily available.</p>
        <p>Now the institution has opened a tattoo parlor, and Mark Hewitt, a 37-year-old inmate in jail for breaking into factories, couldn't be happier.</p>
        <p>''You're excluded from society, so the way to fit in here is to get a tattoo, to blend in and be one of the crew, to be safer,'' said Mr. Hewitt, who for years had been clandestinely puncturing prisoner biceps with sewing needles, guitar strings and homemade ink sometimes made from burnt polystyrene.</p>
        <p>While he says he has always been careful, such practices have contributed to an epidemic of hepatitis C and H.I.V. in prisons in Canada and around the world. Now Mr. Hewitt has been trained by the government to take his art form out of the dark and seamy corners of the jail and into a sterile-looking cinder-block room that looks almost like a dental clinic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hewitt's parlor is part of a pilot project by the Correctional Services of Canada that began in August and now includes five federal prisons across Canada. A sixth, in a woman's prison, is scheduled to open this month. More than 120 inmates have already taken part, paying about $5 per two-hour session.</p>
        <p>Officials here and in the United States say they believe that the pilot project is the first of its kind in the world, another step in a trend of harm-reduction techniques spreading to one degree or another in prisons in many countries. The pilot program, expected to continue through at least 2007, is expected to cost the government roughly $100,000 per prison.</p>
        <p>Tattooing has traditionally been banned in prisons because tattoos are often used to identify inmates with gangs and hate groups. But inmates have managed to get around the bans; 45 percent of Canadian inmates acquire a tattoo while in prison, according to government statistics. That rate has held steady over the last decade despite the widespread knowledge that diseases are spread through reused tattoo needles and ink.</p>
        <p>''You don't want your prisons acting as a pool of infection for the general population,'' said Joanne Barton, a senior health officer working on the program. ''The prevalence of H.I.V. is 7 to 10 times higher in federal penitentiaries than in the general Canadian population, and for hepatitis C the prevalence is 30 times higher.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barton stressed that tattoos connected with hate groups and gangs were prohibited, along with tattoos on the face, neck and genitals. While she acknowledged that illicit tattooing would continue, she said at least now prisons in the pilot project were distributing information on safer techniques.</p>
        <p>But the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers strongly opposes the pilot as a potential danger to its members.</p>
        <p>''This program is doomed for failure,'' said Sylvain Martel, the union's national president. ''Needles will be used against corrections officers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martel also said ''we already have evidence'' that inmates are stealing needles, ink and other paraphernalia from the parlors to be used in illicit tattooing. Prison supervisors say that they have no knowledge of that, adding that there is a careful inventory before and after tattooing sessions.</p>
        <p>Whether legal or not, tattooing is not going to disappear from prisons. Tattoos serve many functions, aside from gang identification. Inmates typically make their bodies a collage of their life, complete with pictures or representations of loved ones and important events like funerals they cannot attend. To understand the importance of tattoos here, one only has to look at Tracy Rivet's body.</p>
        <p>On his right arm is a tattoo displaying a decaying skull with hair flowing out of its mouth. On his chest there is a Christian cross that commemorates his deceased father. And on his left arm there is a wizard and a skull that cover up another tattoo of the name of his former wife. Now he is getting his entire back tattooed with a giant eagle, a symbol of freedom.</p>
        <p>Like many convicts with tattoos, Mr. Rivet has hepatitis C, a debilitating chronic infectious disease that costs the Canadian government more than $20,000 a year per inmate to treat.</p>
        <p>''I always let doctors, nurses and females know about my disease,'' said Mr. Rivet, who is serving a five-year sentence for first-degree manslaughter, after killing two people while driving drunk. ''But only about 50 percent of the inmates are careful,'' he added, referring to sharing tattoo needles and reusing homemade ink.</p>
        <p>The Canadian experiment is being watched closely by other prison systems looking for ways to control infections. It may work best in prisons like Bath, where inmates say gangs do not have a significant presence. Other Canadian prisons where tattoo programs are being tested, in Quebec and the Prairie provinces, have larger gang problems.</p>
        <p>The corrections department in the Spanish province of Catalonia has reviewed the guidelines used in the Canadian program as it prepares to open its own pilot program. One corrections department in Australia has also considered starting a pilot, and the idea could eventually migrate south of the border.</p>
        <p>''If there was a way to demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the risks,'' said Joey Weedon, director of governmental affairs of the American Correctional Association, ''it's certainly a model that correctional administrators in the United States would look at and possibly attempt to copy.''</p>
