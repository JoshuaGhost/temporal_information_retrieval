        <p>A new law came into force allowing bars, pubs and supermarkets in England and Wales to sell alcohol around the clock. According to the BBC, some 60,000 premises have been granted licenses to extend their hours, although only 359 pubs and clubs are getting 24-hour licenses. Law enforcement officials have warned that extending sales of alcohol beyond the previous cutoff of 11 p.m. will promote binge drinking and alcohol-related crime; the government says the new hours will encourage more responsible, Continental-style drinking. ''What we're actually seeing is that at last in this country adults are going to be treated like grown-ups and given a little bit of choice about having a social life beyond 11 o'clock at night,'' Mark Hastings, a spokesman for the British Beer and Pub Association, told the BBC.</p>
