        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A method to compare students' achievements among states may well be needed, but a national curriculum is the last thing we need.</p>
        <p>Diane Ravitch cites test scores showing that 12th graders in the United States lag behind their peers around the world. But does anyone really believe that performance on tests reflects real-world success?</p>
        <p>The strength of the United States has never been that its citizens could recite the names and the dates of the past but that they could find innovative ways to solve the problems of the future.</p>
        <p>What is needed in American education is a renewed devotion to vision and freedom. People wonder why the number of qualified teachers is declining. People don't like being turned into robots. Why not give principals, teachers and students the freedom to engage in a truly American education?</p>
