        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alas, ''Schools Find Spare Change in the Cushions'' (Nov. 6) has exposed us practicing and retired school business officials who have the talent to create deficit-proof budgets; failure to do so used to spell the end of a career in this area. However, the surprise fund surpluses and deficits are symptomatic of a far more serious problem.</p>
        <p>I submit that in most cases, we have educators and civil service managers managing the business end of multi-million-dollar school systems with little or no education or training in basic finance, economics and business management. In 1973, Assemblyman I. William Bianchi Jr. introduced legislation that he and I wrote requiring course work in these areas for obtaining administrative certification specifically for a school business official. Our bill was summarily dismissed, probably at the behest of the ''education fraternity.''</p>
        <p>On behalf of severely strained taxpayers and beleaguered public school districts, I would urge the Legislature to examine this specific area of public school administration with the view of strengthening certification requirements.</p>
