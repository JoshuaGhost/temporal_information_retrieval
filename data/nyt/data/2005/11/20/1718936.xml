        <p>In America, strict grammarians may bemoan the effects of popular culture on the standards of spoken English. In China, however, the latest fad in the huge market for English instruction comes in the form of ''Action English,'' a television show that uses clips from Hollywood movies to teach what it calls ''American slang.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the lessons are straightforward enough. Take for example, Episode 139, which introduced the word ''hit,'' used in the vernacular sense, and illustrated with the 1999 film ''The Thomas Crown Affair.'' The scene in question finds two detectives walking through the darkened halls of a museum, where a Monet had just been purloined. One turns to the other and asks, ''This place been hit before?''</p>

        <p>In America, strict grammarians may bemoan the effects of popular culture on the standards of spoken English. In China, however, the latest fad in the huge market for English instruction comes in the form of ''Action English,'' a television show that uses clips from Hollywood movies to teach what it calls ''American slang.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the lessons are straightforward enough. Take for example, Episode 139, which introduced the word ''hit,'' used in the vernacular sense, and illustrated with the 1999 film ''The Thomas Crown Affair.'' The scene in question finds two detectives walking through the darkened halls of a museum, where a Monet had just been purloined. One turns to the other and asks, ''This place been hit before?''</p>
        <p>In this context, the show explained, being ''hit'' equals being ''robbed.'' It then went on to offer this umbrella definition: that the verb is best used when ''something happens to someone unexpectedly,'' as in the example, ''the telephone company hit me with a bill for over $1,000.'' But the episode did not go into other usages: for instance, an assassin's hit, a Top 40 hit or a marijuana hit. For some of that, one has to wait until Episode 263, featuring the movie ''Gremlins.''</p>
        <p>The program, which began in January and is broadcast almost nightly on the station CCTV 6, has become a cult, well, hit. One of its fans is Huang Wenju, a 15-year-old student from the Sichuan Province who said that the program, ''gives us a meatier English lesson.''</p>
        <p>Still, not everything seems to translate. Episode 61, for instance, wrestled with the term ''walking felony,'' excavated from the comedy ''Legally Blonde.'' In the movie, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), wearing a pink bunny outfit, sashays up to her ex-boyfriend at a party. On seeing her, he exclaims, ''Wow, you look like a walking felony!''</p>
        <p>The show rendered the phrase literally as ''someone that is dangerous.'' ''Thank you,'' she responds. ''You're so sweet.'' Here's hoping military negotiators weren't watching.</p>
