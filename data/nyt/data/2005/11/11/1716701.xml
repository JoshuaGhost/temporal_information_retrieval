        <p>Gov Kathleen Blanco's call for Louisiana lawmakers to set aside ancient rivalries of woods and bayous is itself set aside four days into legislative session that follows Hurricane Katrina; members from rural areas try to protect their programs, cities with large numbers of hurricane evacuees seek aid and lawmakers from stricken south try to begin rebuilding process (M)</p>

        <p>When she called a special legislative session on rebuilding southern Louisiana, Gov.

        <p>When she called a special legislative session on rebuilding southern Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco expressed hope that the state's ancient political rivalries, which have set lawmakers from the piney woods of north Louisiana against those from the swamps and bayous in the south, would finally be cast aside.</p>
        <p>''The nation must see a united front,'' Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, told the Legislature on Sunday night, as she prepared both to cut the budget deeply and to spend large amounts on recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>
        <p>But four days into the 17-day session, there are already signs that the old geographic differences are again bubbling to the surface. Representatives of rural areas to the north are trying to protect their programs from being slashed. Cities that have taken in large numbers of evacuees want money to deal with the overflow. And lawmakers from stricken southern regions are desperately trying to begin the rebuilding process.</p>
        <p>Reggie P. Dupre Jr., a Democratic state senator from Terrebonne Parish, said it was always a challenge to persuade his colleagues from the northern part of the state that coastal restoration and flood protection should be priorities for Louisiana. Some areas in the lower part of his district sank under nine feet of water as Hurricane Katrina traveled the coastline in late August, demolishing homes and shuttering businesses.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to explain to people who aren't from here, or who haven't seen it,'' said Mr. Dupre, who wants the state to assume greater oversight of levee maintenance. ''Our priorities in south Louisiana are not pork barrel issues, like some might say. They are about the survival of coastal communities.''</p>
        <p>But Charles D. Jones, a Democratic state senator who represents an impoverished northern district around Monroe, said his constituents could not afford cuts in government assistance programs, like the 60 after-school teachers who were laid off this month at the Louisiana Center Against Poverty in Lake Providence after the budget cuts began.</p>
        <p>''The area was already poor in the first place,'' Mr. Jones said in a recent interview. ''Now, to absorb these cuts on top of all this is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I supported New Orleans. I voted for the Superdome. I voted for everything these cities needed to improve their economies. Our needs are so great, and we need so much, but no one is paying attention.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of the hurricanes, cities and towns around the state sent hundreds of volunteers and emergency workers to help. The cities took in hundreds of thousands of evacuees from the south and put them up in private homes, shelters and trailer camps.</p>
        <p>But many of the evacuees remain there, taxing city services, and the spirit of generosity is being strained by diminishing resources. Some legislators have complained that the $1,000 per student they have received from the state for educating evacuees is not nearly adequate.</p>
        <p>There has also been an outcry from northern legislators at the governor's decision not to spend any money from a discretionary fund long used to pay for pet projects of members, in part to help reduce a budget deficit approaching $1 billion. The deficit is largely the result of the evacuation from southern Louisiana.</p>
        <p>Elliott Stonecipher, a political analyst and demographer based in Shreveport, said the traditional north-south divide in the Legislature dated to the cultural origins of the state, with French and Caribbean Roman Catholics in the moderate-to-liberal south and Germanic Protestants in the conservative north.</p>
        <p>New Orleans, with a far more concentrated black and Democratic population than the rest of the state, has long had more power in the Legislature than popularity.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows that all of Louisiana benefits from New Orleans,'' Mr. Stonecipher said. ''But New Orleans has also roughed up the rest of the state politically for as long as anyone can remember. There's not a political official, not to mention legislator, outside of New Orleans proper who has not had projects near and dear to them die over and over in the Legislature because of the sheer power and clout of New Orleans. But now they need everyone's help, and that is the irony we find ourselves in.''</p>
        <p>Once the voting on cuts and spending begins, he said, the old divisions will reassert themselves.</p>
        <p>But Robert Adley, a Democratic state senator from the northwest town of Benton, said he believed that the hurricanes' devastation could still produce a consensus.</p>
        <p>''We all know there are three states in Louisiana: north, south and the Isle of Orleans,'' Mr. Adley said. ''But we are a family, and families come together in the time of a crisis.''</p>
