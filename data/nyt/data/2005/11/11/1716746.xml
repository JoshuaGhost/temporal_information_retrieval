        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The C.I.A.'s request for a criminal investigation to determine who revealed the existence of secret United States prisons abroad (news article, Nov. 9) seems a blatant attempt to punish the whistle-blower.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I hope that such an investigation takes place, so that whoever was responsible for the leak can be identified and honored as a hero.</p>
        <p>We know from 20th-century history that governments too often cite threats to national security as an excuse to erode freedom and violate the most basic human rights.</p>
        <p>The recent ceremonies honoring the late Rosa Parks, a hero of the civil rights movement, reminded us that it sometimes requires the breaking of minor laws to remedy major injustices.</p>
        <p>The American prisons abroad, known as ''black sites,'' represent an attempt by the Bush administration to skirt established criminal law and hide the shameful and unlawful treatment of prisoners in United States custody.</p>
        <p>When government itself is a lawbreaker, exposing its violations can only be considered an act of patriotism.</p>
