        <p>If you are interested in starring in a one-person show, here's some advice: don't do it. This genre is already far too crowded and you would be better off working with dialogue instead. But if you must, here's some more advice: call Larry Moss. Over the last few years, Mr. Moss, above, the director and distinguished acting coach, has shaped and staged some of the best solo work in the city. His latest effort is directing ''RFK,'' a biographical play about the Kennedy who might have been president, starring Jack Holmes as the title character. It is running at the Culture Project. When watching an actor directed by Mr. Moss, one gets the sense that each choice has been mulled over and decided with considerable intelligence, and each moment fits snugly into the whole. ''The Syringa Tree,'' Pamela Gien's piece about the final years of apartheid South Africa, may be one of the most successful solo shows in recent years, and it grew out of an acting class conducted by Mr. Moss. ''Who Is Floyd Stearn?'' was one of the better confessional plays about family that I've seen. But Mr. Moss really impressed with the underrated ''Runt of the Litter,'' an account of life in the N.F.L. starring a former jock and theater novice, Bo Eason, who made the most of his limited acting skills. To use a sports cliché, the great coaches get the best out of their players. (Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.)</p>
