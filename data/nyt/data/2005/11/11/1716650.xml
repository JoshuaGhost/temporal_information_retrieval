        <p>The dead were buried, the city mourned and a nation grew defiant on Thursday after the worst act of terrorism in Jordan's history rattled the country's delicate sense of stability and set off an outpouring of emotion in condemnation of the attacks.</p>
        <p>As investigators continued to sift through the rubble left by Wednesday's suicide bombings at three popular hotels, Jordanians struggled to come to terms with what many saw as a direct attack on the country's identity and economy.</p>
        <p>Three suicide bombers tore through the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, a wedding party at the Radisson SAS Hotel down the street, and at the Days Inn Hotel several miles away, killing 56 others and leaving 96 severely injured.</p>
        <p>More than half the victims were Jordanians. Among the dead at the Radisson were the fathers of both the bride and the groom. At least one was American, a spokesman the American Embassy said. Numerous Saudis, Indonesians and Chinese were also among the victims, the government said.</p>
        <p>''This culture that is mingling in our society has no justification,'' said Marwan Muasher, the deputy prime minister, speaking of the suicide bombers. ''Our society will confront them and say, no, no matter what their cause is, be it the occupation of Iraq or Palestine. We will do everything to defend ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Jordan has long struggled to maintain a delicate balance between the interests of its Arab neighbors and those of the United States and Israel.</p>
        <p>Jordan was the second Arab nation to make peace with Israel but has also sought to maintain good relations with its Arab neighbors, including Syria.</p>
        <p>It backed the United States in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has become a staging ground for Iraqis and for foreign businesses entering Iraq. In the process, it has reaped the benefits of trade that has strengthened the economy despite the loss of inexpensive oil once supplied by Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the main terrorist group in Iraq, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, posted an Internet message claiming responsibility for the bombings here. The group's leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, is a Jordanian who has been behind several attempted attacks in Jordan in recent years.</p>
        <p>King Abdullah II, in a forceful address broadcast on Jordanian television, pledged to root out the militants responsible for the bombing. He cut short a state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday in order to respond to the attacks.</p>
        <p>''We will pursue those criminals and those who are behind them, and we will reach them wherever they are,'' Abdullah said in his speech. ''We will confront these cowardly terrorist groups that have no religion or conscience.''</p>
        <p>As day broke on Thursday, crews began cleaning the bomb damage at the hotels while investigators continued to pick through evidence.</p>
        <p>Authorities said two of the suicide bombers entered the lobbies of the Hyatt and Radisson Hotel and set off explosives belts strapped to their bodies, while the third set off his explosive belt outside the Days Inn. Security men recovered what they believe are the remains of the bombers and were conducting DNA analyses to identify them.</p>
        <p>At the Radisson, hotel managers tried to get back to business, and staff members took reservations and checked in guests even as investigators were sifting through the wreckage.</p>
        <p>At midday, hundreds of Jordanians gathered for protest marches in the heart of the capital and elsewhere in the country, waving Jordanian flags and unfurling banners declaring, ''No to cooperation with the forces of evil and fear.'' Some chanted ''Oh, terrorists, listen! We will not bow down to you!'' Others chanted, ''We are Christians, we are Muslim, we are one people!''</p>
        <p>''We came to support our nation and our unity,'' said Ibrahim Haniya, 22, who marched with a group of friends. ''These bombers didn't differentiate between Muslims, Christians or Jews. They were against the world.''</p>
        <p>Yazan Faure, who took part in the march, said: ''We have been trying to help solve the problems of Iraq. All the things we have been doing for Iraq have attracted the eyes of the terrorists, who realize we are still stable.''</p>
        <p>Black flags fluttered from many closed shops, and Jordanian flags were lowered to half-staff as the nation observed a day of mourning. Schools will be closed Saturday, a school day.</p>
        <p>From across the world, leaders telephoned King Abdullah to express their condolences. Among them were Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and President Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said during a meeting in the White House with President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen that the attackers had defiled Islam.</p>
        <p>''The killings should remind all of us that there is an enemy in this world that is willing to kill innocent people, willing to bomb a wedding celebration, in order to advance their cause,'' The Associated Press quoted Mr. Bush as saying.</p>
        <p>The American Embassy advised citizens staying in Jordanian hotels to remain indoors and avoid going to public places like restaurants, night clubs or other locations perceived to be Western.</p>
        <p>The embassy also advised Americans to postpone nonessential travel to Jordan.</p>
        <p>In Dallas, the Council on American-Islamic Relations organized a news conference for a relative of many of the victims of the bombing that shattered the wedding at the Radisson. The relative, Nader Akhras, was born in Jenin, in the West Bank and is now an American citizen.</p>
        <p>''Sixteen of my relatives were killed,'' Mr. Akhras said at the news conference. He described a tearful night at his home in Dallas on Wednesday as family and friends gathered to console one another and wait as news of the deaths arrived via telephone and television. Learning the status of those hospitalized in Amman hospitals has proved especially difficult.</p>
        <p>Although he remains optimistic, he believes some of the critically injured may have already died.</p>
        <p>''Many injured people are still in the hospital,'' he said. ''Some people, they don't know which hospital they go to. Many kids, young kids, we don't know what happened with them.</p>
        <p>''I pray that God will shower his mercy on the injured.''</p>
