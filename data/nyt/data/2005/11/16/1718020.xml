        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Confusion Is Rife About Drug Plan as Sign-Up Nears'' (front page, Nov. 13):</p>
        <p>I am geriatrician, and the majority of my practice will be affected by the new Medicare drug benefit.</p>
        <p>I recently attended a briefing for physicians about the benefit and could hardly believe how confusing it is. I thought that it was unlikely any practicing physicians played a major role in formulating this program.</p>
        <p>Right now, doctors do not get reimbursed for much of the work that goes into the care of older adults. Telephones calls, e-mail messages and paperwork are not tasks for which we can bill Medicare.</p>
        <p>The new drug benefit will likely add many more hours of nonreimbursable work for doctors who will have to navigate through dozens of formularies.</p>
        <p>A simpler system would have been much more beneficial to the most important people involved: patients and physicians.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this will convince the medical community that we must play a more active role in health policy and legislation.</p>
