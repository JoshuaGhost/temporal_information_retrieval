        <p>The special prosecutor in the C.I.A. leak case said on Friday that he would use a new grand jury in his continuing investigation, a development that seemed certain to extend the political cloud hanging over the Bush administration and could draw new players into the investigation.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Patrick J.

        <p>The special prosecutor in the C.I.A. leak case said on Friday that he would use a new grand jury in his continuing investigation, a development that seemed certain to extend the political cloud hanging over the Bush administration and could draw new players into the investigation.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, told a federal judge in a court filing that he would begin additional proceedings before a grand jury different from the one that brought an indictment last month against I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>The 18-month term of the previous grand jury expired last month. In his previous statements, Mr. Fitzgerald had left the door open to using a new grand jury in the case.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor also made clear in the new court filing that ''the investigation is ongoing,'' after saying last month that ''the substantial bulk of the work in this investigation is concluded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzgerald would not comment on his decision to go before a new grand jury, but legal analysts and law enforcement officials said the development suggested that he might be considering calling new witnesses to look at fresh evidence.</p>
        <p>The case generated even greater scrutiny and speculation this week after the disclosure by Bob Woodward of The Washington Post that a confidential source told him in June 2003 that the wife of the former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV, who became a vocal critic of the Bush administration's Iraqi intelligence, worked at the C.I.A. Mr. Woodward said he gave sworn testimony to Mr. Fitzgerald on Monday after his source went to the prosecutor, for reasons still unexplained, to disclose their 2-year-old conversation.</p>
        <p>Legal experts said it was possible that Mr. Fitzgerald might want to take Mr. Woodward and his source before a grand jury to explore the episode, which alters the timeline of events that the prosecutor laid out last month against Mr. Libby.</p>
        <p>The identity of Mr. Woodward's source remains a mystery. More than a dozen top Bush administration officials, including the president and vice president, have directly or indirectly denied telling Mr. Woodward of Mr. Wilson's wife's role at the C.I.A. On Friday, Anna Perez, who served in 2003 as the top communications strategist on the staff of the National Security Council, joined those who had issued denials.</p>
        <p>But a handful of officials have declined to comment, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling in Asia with President Bush. Richard L. Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state, has not replied to messages.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Time magazine reported new details about dealings between Mr. Woodward and the current or former administration official who first told him about the role of Mr. Wilson's wife, Valerie Wilson, at the C.I.A. The magazine reported on its Web site that Mr. Woodward sought on three occasions to persuade his source to release him from his pledge of confidentiality, once in 2004 and twice this year.</p>
        <p>The final effort, Mr. Woodward told the magazine, occurred after Mr. Fitzgerald's Oct. 28 news conference announcing the indictment of Mr. Libby, when the prosecutor said Mr. Libby was the first administration official known to have discussed Ms. Wilson's identity with a reporter when he spoke to Judith Miller, then a reporter for The New York Times, on June 23, 2003.</p>
        <p>According to the magazine, Mr. Woodward recognized then that his source had told him about Ms. Wilson earlier, sometime in mid-June. Mr. Woodward said he had made that point in a call to his source, and the source told him that ''he or she had no alternative but to go to the prosecutor.'' The prosecutor contacted Mr. Woodward on Nov. 3, and Mr. Woodward testified on Nov. 14.</p>
        <p>The use of a new grand jury, perhaps to explore the Woodward issue, does not necessarily indicate that Mr. Fitzgerald plans to bring additional charges against anyone. But current and former prosecutors noted that the process was time-consuming -- the new grand jury will probably have to be read at length from the transcript from the last grand jury on any relevant issues--and that the prosecutor would be unlikely to take such a step lightly.</p>
        <p>''If he's taking the affirmative step of going before a new grand jury, he clearly has more evidence he wants to present,'' said Nicholas Gess, a senior Justice Department official in the Clinton administration. ''That's not just a fishing expedition.''</p>
        <p>E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a former federal prosecutor who is now a prominent defense lawyer in Washington, said the development ''means a little bit of jeopardy to everyone'' who had been connected to the investigation because Mr. Fitzgerald might be exploring new avenues and revisiting old ones.</p>
        <p>''Just when the White House thought it was over the indictment hump with Libby, now all of a sudden you have an active investigation back on the front burner,'' Mr. Barcella said.</p>
        <p>The prospect of a prolonged investigation seems likely to focus increased attention on Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser who has acknowledged having conversations with reporters about Ms. Wilson.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Rove's supporters had expressed hope that Mr. Fitzgerald's decision last month to allow the previous grand jury to expire without charging Mr. Rove signaled he was no longer in jeopardy. But lawyers involved in the case said Mr. Rove remained under scrutiny, and the prosecutor could use the new grand jury to review his case.</p>
        <p>The White House declined to comment on the issue Friday, as did Mr. Rove's lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, who has said he believes his client will ultimately be exonerated.</p>
        <p>Friday's hearing centered on how journalists and the public would be allowed to hear about developments that were likely to touch on both classified material and secret grand jury testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzgerald initially sought a broad order that would have severely restricted the flow of public information during the pre-trial discovery process. But after objections from several news organizations, he agreed Friday to a more limited order that would allow material to be discussed publicly so long as it does not relate to classified documents, grand jury material or private, personal White House information.</p>
