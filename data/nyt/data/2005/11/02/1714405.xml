        <p>A United States Army helicopter aiding the earthquake relief effort reported that it might have been fired on in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir, and both the American military and the Pakistani government are investigating, the American Embassy said. The helicopter, a CH-47 Chinook cargo aircraft, was carrying aid supplies when the crew spotted what appeared to be a rocket-propelled grenade fired from the ground. The helicopter was not hit. Pakistani officials said the helicopter crew might have seen a blast from dynamite being used to clear blocked roads in the area.</p>
