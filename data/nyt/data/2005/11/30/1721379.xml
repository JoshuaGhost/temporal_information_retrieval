        <p>In two votes closely watched by city preservationists, a City Council subcommittee and full committee voted yesterday to reverse a decision by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The Council acted to reverse the designation of landmark status for the Austin, Nichols &amp; Company Warehouse, a 1915 building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The owner wants to change the facade. The vote in the subcommittee was 4 to 0 in favor of reversal (with 3 absent) and 16 to 3 in the full land-use committee (with one absent). A vote by the full Council is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. today.</p>
