        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a teenager, I am bothered that society is so quick to blame kids and teenagers for all the ills and annoyances of the world.</p>
        <p>When I go out, as often as not it is adults who are the major annoyance, whether they are on their cellphones, having a loud conversation with others or even loudly disciplining their children.</p>
        <p>The best way for parents to teach their children to be polite and respectful is not just discipline but also providing a good model and being respectful themselves -- of other adults and, yes, even of youth.</p>
        <p>That way, we are not only teaching good manners but also the valuable lesson that it is not all right to preach one thing and do another.</p>
