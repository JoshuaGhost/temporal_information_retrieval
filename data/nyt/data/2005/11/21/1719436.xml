        <p>Caroline Bierbaum figured she would not be running her junior year. She said she did not think her form would ever return to what it had been.</p>
        <p>She was so sure of it, she scheduled all of her classes for the fall semester during practice time.</p>
        <p>Bierbaum, a cross-country runner at Columbia, is now a senior with two Ivy League championship rings and three near misses in national meets. She is among the favorites to win the N.C.A.A. title at the national championships today in Terre Haute, Ind.</p>
        <p>A 22-year-old native of New York City, Bierbaum enrolled at Duke in the fall of 2002, joining one of the nation's elite track-and-field programs. She earned all-American honors in her first year.</p>
        <p>But Bierbaum decided Durham, N.C., was not for her. Meanwhile, she was struggling with her form. She missed the winter and spring track seasons and struggled in her workouts over the summer of 2003.</p>
        <p>''It really had nothing to do with running there,'' Bierbaum said. ''I didn't like the social life, and I wanted to be closer to home.''</p>
        <p>She contacted Craig Lake, who was the women's cross-country coach at Columbia, and expressed an interest in transferring. Lake invited her for a recruiting visit, ''but she was signed, sealed and delivered before she even came up.''</p>
        <p>''She knew she wanted to be in the city and compete at a Division I school,'' Lake said.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2003, Bierbaum arrived at Columbia, but her performance did not improve.</p>
        <p>''I was just awful from the get-go,'' she said. ''I thought maybe I was just burned out or hadn't taken enough rest between seasons.''</p>
        <p>She said she wondered if she had lost the drive that is crucial to distance runners. She said, ''I thought: 'I'm obviously just not trying hard enough. I should just suck it up and run faster.' ''</p>
        <p>In August 2004, when Bierbaum had her annual medical exam before her junior year, a blood test revealed the cause of her struggles. ''Nothing was really wrong, except that I had severe anemia,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Bierbaum began taking iron supplements, and the results were immediate. She entered several New York Road Runners races and soon returned to competitive form.</p>
        <p>Bierbaum broke through last November, when she became the first Columbia runner to win the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. That victory triggered a series of record-breaking results over the next year, including a third-place finish at the N.C.A.A. cross-country championships and a first-place finish in the Ivy League outdoor 10,000 meters.</p>
        <p>This season, she has won the Ivy Heptagonals, setting a course record at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. She then led the Lions through pre-nationals and regionals to earn a berth in the national championships.</p>
        <p>Columbia's objective is to crack the top 10 for the first time, while Bierbaum's former team, Duke, is competing for the national title.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel like they need me or I need them to do well,'' she said. ''I don't think they're particularly nostalgic, and I don't feel that way, either. That team I'm sure will win on Monday, and they can do it with or without me.</p>
        <p>''I usually do pretty well in races where there should be a lot of pressure. Any pressure I feel comes from within myself.''</p>
