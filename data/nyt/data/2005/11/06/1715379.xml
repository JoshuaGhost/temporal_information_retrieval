        <p>Harbor View Floor-Through  $1,100,000</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: 146 Columbia Heights (near Clark Street)</p>
        <p>A first-floor co-op in a magnificent 19th-century brownstone with a large living space, an oversize master bedroom, a den/office, a compact kitchen and two full baths. Delores E. Grant, the Corcoran Group (718) 923-8096; www.corcoran.com. Open house Sunday, 12-2 p.m.</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1, 245 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: The apartment, with modern amenities, a wood-burning fireplace, soaring ceilings and all of its grand original details intact, is built on a lot that is a city block deep, and has unparalleled harbor and skyline views.</p>
        <p>CONS: Although the den/office could be used as a guest bedroom, or even a second bedroom, it has no closet space.</p>
        <p>Two-Bedroom Condo in Harlem  $599,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 163 St. Nicholas Avenue (at 118th Street), #3B</p>
        <p>An 868-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath condo apartment in the Rosa Parks Condominium, which opened 18 months ago. Lawrence Comroe (212) 875-2942 or Tony Oakley (212) 875-2943, Corcoran Group, www.corcoran.com</p>
        <p>COMMON CHARGES: $377 a month, plus $12 a month in taxes</p>
        <p>PROS: With the cherry wood floors, stainless steel appliances and marble bathrooms seemingly untouched, this apartment is practically new. Windows have a view of the courtyard, laundry is in the basement, the doorman is 24 hours and the subway is two blocks away. The common charges are low and a tax abatement lasts for 25 years.</p>
        <p>CONS: The living/dining room is narrow.</p>
        <p>West Village One-Bedroom  $769,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 49 West 12th Street (between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas), #10B</p>
        <p>A 750-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bath co-op apartment. Jeffrey Stockwell (646) 613-2715 or Robert Faust (646) 613-2716, Stribling &amp; Associates, www.stribling.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,124 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Set amid the campus buildings of the New School and New York University in the West Village, this co-op is surrounded by shops and restaurants, with transportation nearby. It has a quiet city view out the back of the building and comes with a washer and dryer, which have been grandfathered into this unit.</p>
        <p>CONS: While this was a trophy renovation five years ago, flush with pinks and blues and silvers, it is worn now and will most likely be read as an invitation to strip the paint and start again.</p>
        <p>Grand Old Scarsdale Colonial  $4,995,000</p>
        <p>WESTCHESTER: 34 Greenacres Avenue</p>
        <p>A six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bath house with a three-story staircase and a 44-foot-long sun room. Lynne Clark, Julia B. Fee (914) 725-3305; www.juliabfee.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $56,126 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: This 94-year-old home, with 9,000 square feet of living space, lends itself to entertaining. The bathrooms and kitchen have been newly renovated.</p>
        <p>CONS: The wood floors in the house are showing their age.</p>
        <p>A Master's Style  $899,900</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY: 214 Highland Avenue, Montclair</p>
        <p>A Frank Lloyd Wright-style mountaintop home designed in 1961 by the architect Harry B. Mahler as his family home. The house has five bedrooms and two and a half baths. Many of the walls are glass, and a full-length deck gives year-round views of Manhattan. L. Gail Shepard, Coldwell Banker (973) 785-5100; www.coldwellbanker.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $16,055 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: Like any true example of Wright-inspired architecture, this open and airy house seems to meld with its natural setting.</p>
        <p>CONS: The driveway is steep, and the bathrooms are nothing special.</p>
