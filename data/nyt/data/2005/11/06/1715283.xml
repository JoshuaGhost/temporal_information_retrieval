        <p>HENRY HATHAWAY'S 1947 noir is best known for the scene in which Richard Widmark's psychotic gangster, Tommy Udo, ties an old woman into her wheelchair and, with a vicious snicker, pushes her down a staircase. It's a great scene, but it doesn't have the melodramatic depth of the one in which Victor Mature's bad-guy-turned-good-guy, recently paroled after agreeing to inform on a bunch of villains who truly deserve it, is reunited with his daughters.</p>
        <p>They've been placed in an orphanage after the suicide of their despairing mother. In their crisply pressed Catholic orphanage clothes, they appear before him, recognizing him as their daddy but not quite knowing how to greet him. Mature hangs back awkwardly, too, but when the attending nun suggests that the girls might like to give their father a hug, he sinks to the floor and wraps them in his giant bear paws, a supreme example of an actor using his whole being to capture the essence of a moment.</p>

        <p>HENRY HATHAWAY'S 1947 noir is best known for the scene in which Richard Widmark's psychotic gangster, Tommy Udo, ties an old woman into her wheelchair and, with a vicious snicker, pushes her down a staircase. It's a great scene, but it doesn't have the melodramatic depth of the one in which Victor Mature's bad-guy-turned-good-guy, recently paroled after agreeing to inform on a bunch of villains who truly deserve it, is reunited with his daughters.</p>
        <p>They've been placed in an orphanage after the suicide of their despairing mother. In their crisply pressed Catholic orphanage clothes, they appear before him, recognizing him as their daddy but not quite knowing how to greet him. Mature hangs back awkwardly, too, but when the attending nun suggests that the girls might like to give their father a hug, he sinks to the floor and wraps them in his giant bear paws, a supreme example of an actor using his whole being to capture the essence of a moment.</p>
        <p>When we think of noir, we naturally think of other things first: furtive gunshots and neon-bathed streets pictured in velvety newsprint tones. But the look on Mature's face as he hugs those little girls -- the desperate joy of a man who finally knows what home is -- cuts to the heart of noir and its fixation not with angels and devils but with those caught in between: people who have sinned and are trying to go straight against all odds.</p>
        <p>This isn't Hathaway's most emotionally charged noir -- it doesn't have the unsettling melancholy of ''Call Northside 777'' -- and it's true that Widmark's astonishing performance threatens to steal the show. But Mature, an Ursa Major of a man who was made to wear athletic-fit suits even before there was such a thing, carries the spirit of noir in his every muscle, making us feel how heavy a load it is. (20th Century Fox, Dec. 6, $14.99)</p>
