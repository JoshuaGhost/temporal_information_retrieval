        <p>NASHVILLE</p>
        <p>Thirty-five Chinese artisans spent one month shaping almost two million pounds of ice into a 20,000-square-foot exhibit, below, at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center called, appropriately enough, ''Ice.''</p>
        <p>Inside the exhibit are ice sculptures and monuments, elaborate scenes like an old-fashioned country home and a Christmas castle, ice slides and dazzling lighting. Because of the chill, free hooded parkas will be issued to every visitor.</p>

        <p>NASHVILLE</p>
        <p>Thirty-five Chinese artisans spent one month shaping almost two million pounds of ice into a 20,000-square-foot exhibit, below, at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center called, appropriately enough, ''Ice.''</p>
        <p>Inside the exhibit are ice sculptures and monuments, elaborate scenes like an old-fashioned country home and a Christmas castle, ice slides and dazzling lighting. Because of the chill, free hooded parkas will be issued to every visitor.</p>
        <p>Ice will be open from Nov. 17 through Jan. 8. (A similar exhibit will also come to Gaylord's properties in Kissimmee, Fla., and Grapevine, Tex.) Admission will be $14.75 from Monday through Thursday and $16.75 from Friday through Sunday. See www.gaylordhotels.com for more information.</p>
        <p>As of late October, flights to Nashville from New York in mid-November started at $259 on Delta.</p>
        <p>BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND</p>
        <p>Clotheshow Live, which calls itself the largest fashion event in the world, will bring top designers and consumers alike to town from Dec. 2 to 7 for six days of runway shows, makeovers, demonstrations and beauty tips and nonstop shopping. Attendees will be among the first to see and own the latest creations from the designers. Essentially a weeklong party, Clotheshow will also feature live bands and constant streams of celebrities to ogle. The Web site, www.clotheshowlive.com, will even be posting updates on which famous faces will be showing up.</p>
        <p>People attending the show can also shop all day and purchase the latest creations from the designers. Each 45-minute runway show requires a Â£21 ticket ($38 at $1.81 to the pound), available through the Web site. As of late October, flights to Birmingham from the New York area in time for the show began at $260 on Lufthansa.</p>
        <p>EHUKAI BEACH, HAWAII</p>
        <p>The North Shore of Oahu -- home to awe-inspiring swells and the formidable Banzai Pipeline -- will be the site of the Rip Curl Pro Pipeline Masters, the final competition in the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing and of the Association of Surfing Professionals World Championship Tour.</p>
        <p>The Pipeline Masters will run from Dec. 8 to Dec. 20 and will feature the world's top surfers, most likely including Kelly Slater and Andy Irons, above, ranked first and second on this year's championship tour.</p>
        <p>More information is at www.triplecrownofsurfing.com.</p>
        <p>The pipeline is about a 35-mile drive from Honolulu. As of late October, flights to Honolulu from New York for the event started at $613 on ATA.</p>
