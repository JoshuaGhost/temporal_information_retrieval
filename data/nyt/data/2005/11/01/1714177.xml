        <p>An off-duty police sergeant was arrested early yesterday and charged with driving while intoxicated, the police said. A passer-by saw the sergeant, Joseph Kissone, driving erratically along Fulton Street in East New York about 2 a.m. and alerted an officer who was patrolling the area, the police said. The officer pulled Sergeant Kissone over in front of a tire shop and arrested him after noticing that he was unsteady on his feet, the police said. Sergeant Kissone, an 11-year veteran who is assigned to Manhattan courts, has been suspended, the police said.</p>
