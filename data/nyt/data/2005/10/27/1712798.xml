        <p>President Bush urged Congress on Wednesday to ''push the envelope'' on spending cuts to help pay for hurricane relief while the administration backtracked on a ruling covering storm reconstruction that had come under steady attack from unions, Democrats and some Republicans.</p>
        <p>Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said the administration would reinstate the Davis-Bacon Act on Nov. 8 in the areas devastated by the Gulf Coast storms. That law requires paying wages at locally prevailing levels at construction projects financed by federal money.</p>

        <p>President Bush urged Congress on Wednesday to ''push the envelope'' on spending cuts to help pay for hurricane relief while the administration backtracked on a ruling covering storm reconstruction that had come under steady attack from unions, Democrats and some Republicans.</p>
        <p>Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said the administration would reinstate the Davis-Bacon Act on Nov. 8 in the areas devastated by the Gulf Coast storms. That law requires paying wages at locally prevailing levels at construction projects financed by federal money.</p>
        <p>The White House suspended the law after Hurricane Katrina, saying the change could speed repairs and stretch federal aid. Critics said the administration, backed by conservative Congressional Republicans, was taking advantage of the disaster to lift a law important to unions.</p>
        <p>The critics gained important support from a coalition of Northeastern and Midwestern Republicans who represent districts with significant union membership. They urged the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., to reverse the policy in meetings last week in the Capitol and again at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''With all the political problems the administration has, why pick this fight?'' asked Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said suspending the rule would not produce significant savings because the labor demand in the affected areas would drive up wages on its own.</p>
        <p>''Politically, it seemed a gratuitous shot at unions who in many cases have supported the administration,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Democrats and labor leaders hailed the reinstatement but said they believed that they would have eventually been able to lift the suspension legislatively had the White House not acted.</p>
        <p>''Let me be clear,'' said Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who was pushing a legislative challenge. ''The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice.''</p>
        <p>John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a statement that it was ''fundamentally wrong for the Bush administration to hit workers when they were down by slashing wages, exacerbating the very poverty that the hurricanes exposed.''</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''Good jobs with good wages that provide a promising future for residents are a critical first step on the road to recovery.''</p>
        <p>Some Congressional Republicans were critical of the reversal, saying it will mean that federal relief dollars will ultimately buy less.</p>
        <p>''By reinstating Davis-Bacon, recovery projects will be delayed, and costs will be inflated,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flake and other House conservatives intensified their push for cuts in federal spending after the storm, contributing to the current drive in the House and Senate for at least $35billion in reductions the next five years.</p>
        <p>In a speech to the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Bush encouraged lawmakers to impose across-the-board spending cuts. He said the House and Senate were ''making progress toward cuts that will show the American people we're capable of being wise about the money and, at the same time, meet our priorities.''</p>
        <p>Setting up a politically charged floor fight next week, the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday approved by a party-line vote a package with $39billion in spending reductions and revenue increases. The package includes a plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and a $10billion cut for Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans say the changes are needed to help pay for disaster aid and slow the growth of government. Democrats are uniformly opposed, saying that the cuts are harsh and that they will in some cases fall hardest on those displaced by the storms.</p>
        <p>''I have never felt that a budget going through the Congress of the United States is more disconnected from reality than this budget,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee.</p>
        <p>House committees advanced their own plans intended to identify $50billion in savings, with panels approving proposals to cut money to enforce child support, to tighten eligibility for foster care aid and to raise premiums for employers who contribute to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the House Agriculture Committee is to consider reducing spending on food stamps by more than $1billion. House members are also pushing their own Arctic drilling plan and a proposal to increase offshore drilling.</p>
        <p>The delicacy of some of those issues makes it difficult for House Republicans to round up the votes to pass their proposal next month, and the leadership is trying to secure support from balking moderates.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said he did not view the administration switch on the wage law as part of any effort to win votes for the spending cuts.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't any trade-off,'' said Mr. King, who said he was undecided on the spending package. ''I am going to wait and see.''</p>
