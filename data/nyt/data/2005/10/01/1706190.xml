        <p>IT is enough to ruin the rest of your weekend.</p>
        <p>At a time when ''only 25 percent of workers are very confident that they'll have enough money to live comfortably in retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute,'' Essence magazine runs a feature on women in their 40's -- and younger -- who have retired.</p>
        <p>How they had the money to do that is not surprising: all of them lived well below their means while working, writes Tamara E. Holmes. In addition, some benefited from last decade's booming stock market, others took advantage of rapidly rising real estate prices to cash in and the rest were able to retire on half salary after 20 years of government service.</p>
        <p>But what is surprising is how they are defining the next phase of their lives.</p>
        <p>''Retirement doesn't mean you've got a ton of money and can now buy yourself out of a life of misery into a life of bliss,'' Asha Tyson said. ''Retirement means having freedom to live the life you choose.''</p>
        <p>These women are choosing to do volunteer work and cultivate hobbies like learning to play the piano. Others, after taking a substantial break, have gone back to work, choosing jobs that are more fulfilling than those they had the first time around.</p>
        <p>GENDER GAP -- Despite the good news presented in the Essence article, women still trail men when it comes to saving for retirement, according to the current issue of AARP magazine. ''More men (65 percent) than women (59 percent) report that they're currently saving for that gold watch day,'' the magazine reports.</p>
        <p>One reason is that women set their sights lower than men when it comes to thinking about retirement. Women, the magazine said, tend to plan for an ''adequate'' retirement, while men said they want to be ''well off.''</p>
        <p>But there is an even simpler explanation, according to Robert Prisuta, AARP research director: ''Women have less savings because they've always earned -- and still earn -- less money than men do.'' And, according to the study, fewer women (45 percent) than men (57 percent) are even offered a retirement plan at work, making saving that much more difficult.</p>
        <p>LUMINARY LANDLORDS -- Looking for a getaway? How does this sound: a four-bedroom beachfront villa in Mustique in the West Indies. The home, which has a pool and a croquet lawn, comes with a Jeep and a staff of six. The price is $13,000 for the week. If interested, contact Mick Jagger.</p>
        <p>He is just one of a number of celebrities willing to rent out their homes for a substantial price, according to the current issue of V Life, published by the people who bring you the entertainment industry trade magazine Variety.</p>
        <p>Bruce Willis offers his three-villa compound in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean for $15,000 to $20,000 a night. The Necker Island retreat of Sir Richard Branson in the British Virgin Islands ''includes private beaches, freshwater pools and a staff of 18 to show you where everything is; prices begin at $20,000 a night.</p>
        <p>''As real estate becomes an ever more attractive investment, the trend of industryites offering their vacation homes and other getaways as private rentals -- with some of their prized possessions among the amenities -- is growing,'' Ellin Stein reports.</p>
        <p>By the way, Mr. Jagger is particular about his renters. The Rolling Stones front man has hired a property agent to handle all the details, but he ''vets potential renters himself by reviewing a questionnaire.''</p>
        <p>''He is mostly concerned with the number of occupants and their professions,'' says his rental agent, who adds that Mr. Jagger ''tends to shy away from people in rock and roll.''</p>
        <p>FINAL TAKE -- Here's a scary thought as you start thinking about Halloween: Cargo magazine reports that Donald Trump-style wigs have been huge sellers, ''flying off the sales floor.''</p>
        <p>For those of us who are going to become bored quickly hearing ''the Donald's'' catchphrase, ''You're fired,'' instead of ''trick or treat,'' the magazine adds that pimp and pirate costumes are also selling well.</p>
