        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Said to Seek a Lower Price Than the $25.4 Billion It Bid for Guidant  Johnson &amp; Johnson wants to negotiate a lower price than the $25.4 billion it agreed to pay for Guidant, the medical device maker being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration over safety issues after it recalled thousands of pacemakers and defibrillators, two people involved in the talks said. Johnson and Johnson's chief financial officer, Robert Darretta, said the company was reviewing its options under the deal. Market Place. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Tax Commission to Recommend Fewer Deductions  President Bush's tax advisory commission agreed to recommend two alternate plans; both would limit or eliminate almost all existing tax deductions, including those for state and local income and property taxes. [A13.]</p>
        <p>Another Turnaround Plan in Ford's Future  With Ford facing high labor costs and the obligation to support hundreds of thousands of retirees and their families, the chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., plans to announce the second proposal of his four-year tenure to make the company profitable. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Drug Maker Might Let Others Make Bird Flu Medicine  Facing pressure from governments seeking to fight a possible bird flu epidemic, the Swiss drug maker Roche said that it was willing to negotiate to allow outside companies to make its drug Tamiflu, which has been shown to fight avian influenza. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Advertisers Ringing Jingle Bells Before Heating Season  The Christmas shopping season is off and running -- weeks before the first trick-or-treaters have rung their first doorbells. Advertisers, marketers and retailers, worried that high fuel prices will crimp spending on holiday shopping later this fall, are moving up their Christmas pitches to begin even before the first heating bill has arrived. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C1.]</p>
        <p>Setback for Bristol-Myers and Merck on Diabetes Drug  Bristol-Myers and Merck sustained a setback in their plans to sell a first-of-its-kind diabetes medication designed to control blood sugar while also lowering cholesterol. The Food and Drug Administration deferred approval of the drug, Pargluva, and asked for more information about its cardiovascular safety. The companies said the agency wanted more information from patient trials that were completed since Bristol and Merck submitted data in support of the application. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Hollywood Detective Case Is Not Over Yet  Anthony Pellicano, a onetime private detective to the stars now finishing a 30-month sentence on federal firearms charges, expects to be indicted again in weeks, his lawyers say. And with a parade of Hollywood power brokers -- lawyers, agents and executives -- having been called before a grand jury or questioned by federal agents, the industry is bracing for the possibility that the damage will not end with the disgraced former detective. [C1.]</p>
        <p>How a Big Investor Fell Into the Refco Deal  Refco's bankruptcy filing has cleared the way for an investor group led by J. Christopher Flowers, a private equity investor, to buy Refco's core brokerage business for about $768 million. In its filing, Refco listed assets of $48.77 billion and liabilities of $48.60 billion, with more than 1,000 creditors. The filing listed more than $3.4 billion in debt owed to the 50 largest unsecured creditors. [C4.]</p>
        <p>The bankruptcy filing by Refco has made it more difficult for the company's auditor, Grant Thornton, to track down how questionable transactions that essentially hid who owed the company $430 million escaped detection. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Merrill Posts 49 Percent Increase in Quarterly Profit  Merrill Lynch reported a 49 percent increase in third-quarter earnings on major gains in trading and investment banking, wealth management and asset management. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Fall After Report on Wholesale Prices  Stocks declined after a report showed the biggest jump in producer prices in 15 years, rekindling inflation concerns. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.96 points, to 1,178.14; the Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.84 points, to 10,285.26; and the Nasdaq lost 14.30 points, to 2,056. [C11.]</p>
