        <p>Two federal officials suspected of telling friends and relatives about a possible terror threat on the New York City subways before the threat was made public have been stripped of their security clearance pending an investigation, officials with the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The leaks were traced to the officials through e-mail messages apparently sent by the son of one official on Oct. 3, and a friend of the other on Oct. 5, according to copies of the messages. The writer of one message said that his father ''works for Homeland Security, at a very high position,'' and that after speaking with him, ''the only information that I can pass on is that everyone should at all costs not ride the subway for the next 2 weeks.''</p>

        <p>Two federal officials suspected of telling friends and relatives about a possible terror threat on the New York City subways before the threat was made public have been stripped of their security clearance pending an investigation, officials with the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The leaks were traced to the officials through e-mail messages apparently sent by the son of one official on Oct. 3, and a friend of the other on Oct. 5, according to copies of the messages. The writer of one message said that his father ''works for Homeland Security, at a very high position,'' and that after speaking with him, ''the only information that I can pass on is that everyone should at all costs not ride the subway for the next 2 weeks.''</p>
        <p>The writer of the second message identified himself as the friend of someone in the Coast Guard working with Homeland Security. He warned recipients to stay off the subways from Oct. 7 to 10.</p>
        <p>The e-mail messages were sent days before the Bloomberg administration announced the warnings on Oct. 6. One recipient of the messages forwarded them to the Police Department.</p>
        <p>The official who warned his son about the possible threat was William Ross, a director with the Transportation Security Administration at Philadelphia International Airport, according to an official with Homeland Security who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing. The Transportation Security Administration referred calls to Homeland Security, where a spokeswoman declined to comment on specifics of the case.</p>
        <p>The identity of the second official, described as a Coast Guard employee, was not made public yesterday. The Coast Guard suspended the clearance of an employee who came forward late Friday, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The suspensions were first reported yesterday in The Daily News.</p>
