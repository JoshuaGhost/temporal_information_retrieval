        <p>Oh, to be a student in Brooklyn, especially a barbecue-loving one in the vicinity of Pig'N Out Barbeque, at 60 Henry Street (Orange Street). The owners -- from left above, John Tsakinis, Roderick Marino and Tomasz Surowka-- now offer a 20 percent discount to students between 11 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. (nonstudents get the discount between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.) Monday through Friday. The owners, whose roots are in Greece, the Philippines and Poland, far from barbecue country, do not pretend to be barbecue purists, offering on a new menu effective next week Greek salads, chicken teriyaki and garden burgers along with St. Louis-style ribs, Carolina pulled-pork sandwiches, sweet potato fries and baked beans. Prices range from $3.50 for some starters to $135 for a feast that serves 10: (718)522-5547.</p>
