        <p>The inquiry into a onetime private detective to the stars - who is now in prison on firearms charges - has extended to some Hollywood power brokers.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Anthony Pellicano, the onetime private detective to the stars now finishing a 30-month sentence on federal firearms charges, expects to be indicted again in weeks, his lawyers say.</p>
        <p>And with a parade of Hollywood power brokers -- lawyers, agents and executives -- having been called before a grand jury or questioned by federal agents, the industry is bracing for the possibility that the damage will not end with the disgraced former detective.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pellicano, 61, whose clients included celebrities defending their reputations and entertainment lawyers seeking to bolster their cases, went to jail in 2003 after pleading guilty to possession of unregistered firearms, grenades and explosives. But the F.B.I. continued to chase after much bigger prey: accusations that Mr. Pellicano had engaged in widespread illegal wiretapping on behalf of lawyers and their clients, with the help of a rogue law enforcement officer and a telephone company worker.</p>
        <p>Now, as a three-year grand jury investigation draws to its close, prosecutors are in the final stages of assembling what is expected to be a racketeering case against Mr. Pellicano, according to people involved in or briefed on the case. The acts that Mr. Pellicano and others are expected to be accused of include wiretapping and witness tampering.</p>
        <p>No one interviewed for this article could say with certainty if any of Hollywood's major players would be indicted along with Mr. Pellicano. But new charges against him -- and continued pressure on him to break his silence and testify against others -- appear all but inevitable, his lawyers say.</p>
        <p>''They're definitely going to indict him on the wiretapping before he gets out,'' said Victor Sherman, one of Mr. Pellicano's criminal lawyers. ''November sounds right.''</p>
        <p>The sprawling investigation has extended to some of the entertainment industry's biggest names.</p>
        <p>Those questioned include, to name a few, Kevin Huvane and Brian Lourd, two top partners at Creative Artists Agency, the dominant Hollywood talent agency; Michael S. Ovitz, the onetime president of the Walt Disney Company who previously headed Creative Artists; Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios and a former partner at Creative Artists, who was called before the grand jury to discuss his friendship with Mr. Pellicano; Brad Grey, the chairman of the Paramount Motion Pictures Group, who formerly headed Brillstein-Grey Entertainment; and Bert Fields, the entertainment lawyer, who has said he employed Mr. Pellicano countless times as an investigator but was not aware of any wiretapping.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz has told investigators that he never hired Mr. Pellicano to conduct wiretaps, and, in fact, was unknowingly recorded by him, his lawyer said. Mr. Grey has been assured by the government that he is only a witness in the investigation, according to his spokesman. Spokesmen for Mr. Meyer at Universal and for Mr. Lourd and Mr. Huvane at Creative Artists declined to comment, as did Mr. Fields's lawyer.</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor, Daniel Saunders, an assistant United States attorney, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Pellicano, who refused two requests for an interview, originated in June 2002 when a reporter, Anita Busch, was threatened while she was pursuing a article for The Los Angeles Times about the actor Steven Seagal and his relationship with a mob figure. A tip from an informer led the F.B.I. to a convicted felon who was recorded saying he had been hired by Mr. Pellicano to stop Ms. Busch's reporting.</p>
        <p>That November, after Ms. Busch discovered that her phone had been tapped, investigators raided Mr. Pellicano's office, seizing computer files with nearly two billion pages of notes and transcripts of wiretaps. They also found weapons, and Mr. Pellicano first pleaded guilty in October 2003 to illegally possessing unregistered firearms; he was sentenced to 30 months in prison in January 2004. He contested the search, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court last June. A week later, the Los Angeles district attorney charged Mr. Pellicano with threatening Ms. Busch. That case has not yet gone to trial.</p>
        <p>All along, however, the federal government has pursued the wiretapping case. Steadily, a host of people who did business with Mr. Pellicano, his lawyer-clients, or the lawyers' clients in turn, have had the eerie experience of hearing their words read back to them -- or of seeing transcripts or notes of their conversations.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for one plaintiff in a lawsuit defended by Mr. Fields, for example, said prosecutors had shown him notes taken by Mr. Pellicano of conversations between him and his client. ''It's like, whoa -- I can remember sitting at my desk uttering those words,'' said the lawyer, who insisted on anonymity to avoid being seen as interfering with the case.</p>
        <p>Others have been shaken by interviews in which F.B.I. agents intimated, without providing details, that they had been taped unknowingly.</p>
        <p>In June 2004, for example, F.B.I. agents visited Mr. Huvane and Mr. Lourd, according to a Creative Artists employee with knowledge of the meeting. The two sat dumbfounded for 45 minutes, the person said, as the F.B.I. agents asked if they knew that Mr. Pellicano had been hired by Mr. Ovitz, the agency's former chief, to investigate them; if they knew they had been taped; the nature of their relationship with Mr. Ovitz; and if they knew Mr. Fields. Neither heard from the F.B.I. again, the person said.</p>
        <p>The two men's relationship with Mr. Ovitz, of course, had long since disintegrated. After Mr. Ovitz was fired by Disney in 1997, he formed Artists Management Group, trying to re-enter the talent business as a manager. His successors at Creative Artists interpreted his pursuit of their clients as a betrayal and refused to share them with him, and Mr. Ovitz was forced to sell Artists Management in 2002.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, was questioned before the grand jury about Mr. Ovitz, his former partner at Creative Artists, and about Mr. Pellicano, a longtime friend of Mr. Meyer, according to two people aware of his testimony who, like others interviewed for this article, insisted on anonymity to avoid angering law enforcement officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz referred questions to his lawyer, Bart H. Williams, who said Mr. Ovitz had cooperated fully with the F.B.I. over several interviews. He said Mr. Ovitz had engaged Mr. Pellicano through a law firm for three litigation matters but did not authorize or know of any wiretapping. But he said prosecutors had not even suggested to Mr. Ovitz or asked him if he had hired Mr. Pellicano to look into his former partners at Creative Artists.</p>
        <p>''In fact, it's come to our attention that Mr. Ovitz was taped by Anthony Pellicano,'' Mr. Williams said. ''If one thing's become clear to me, it's that Anthony Pellicano consistently peddled information about Michael Ovitz to third parties.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grey, who has been interviewed by investigators, became connected to Mr. Pellicano through several lawsuits in which Mr. Fields represented him.</p>
        <p>A witness in one suit against Mr. Grey recalled a phone conversation with a lawyer for the plaintiff. ''I asked, 'If I remember something today that I didn't remember three months ago, do I have to bring that up?''' the witness recalled. The lawyer said no.</p>
        <p>Not 30 seconds after they hung up, the witness recalled, the phone rang. '''It's Anthony Pellicano,' he says,'' the witness recalled. '''I work for Brad Grey. I'm telling you to do the right thing.''' The witness added that Mr. Pellicano sounded friendly until he said, ''If you remember something today that you didn'tremember before, you have to tell us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grey has publicly said he never heard anything about illegal wiretapping. ''As Mr. Grey said before, he has cooperated fully with the government investigation and has been assured by them that he is a witness only,'' said his spokeswoman, Janet Hill.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no one other than Mr. Pellicano figures more prominently in the federal investigation than Mr. Fields, the 76-year-old entertainment lawyer whose first prominent case with Mr. Pellicano was their work for Michael Jackson when he faced allegations in 1993 that he had sexually molested a young boy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fields disclosed nearly two years ago that he was a subject of the federal investigation but denied any wrongdoing. He said in an interview that he had not been questioned since 2003.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fields's law firm, Greenberg, Glusker, Fields, Claman, Machtinger &amp; Kinsella, has been in a tug of war with investigators over documents, and several of its members have retained criminal lawyers.</p>
        <p>Two lawyers at the firm said that the grand jury had subpoenaed client files for cases in which Mr. Pellicano was the investigator but that the firm had convinced a judge that many were privileged.</p>
        <p>Brian Sun, a criminal lawyer for the firm, confirmed only that the government had requested documents.</p>
        <p>One lawyer at Greenberg Glusker who has been questioned by prosecutors more than once is Charles Sheppard, who heads the firm's litigation department. According to another lawyer at the firm, Mr. Sheppard and Mr. Fields worked on at least one matter in which Mr. Pellicano was involved: a lawsuit between Mr. Grey and a writer, Bo Zenga, over a producing project. Mr. Zenga has said he was questioned about wiretapping and witness intimidation before the grand jury.</p>
        <p>Mark Harris, a lawyer for Mr. Sheppard, said of his client, ''He's been cooperative, as others have'' at the firm. But he said Mr. Sheppard had made no deal to be a cooperating witness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said he was representing other lawyers at the firm but declined to say whom.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 15, 2006, Wednesday  An article in The Arts on Feb. 11 about the federal investigation of Anthony Pellicano, a former Hollywood private detective, referred incorrectly to computer data seized in a raid on his office in 2002. (The error also occurred in articles on Feb. 6 this year and on Oct. 19, 2005.) Investigators said they had recovered storage devices with a capacity of 3.868 terabytes of data, which they said would be the equivalent of two billion pages of double-spaced text. They did not find two billion pages of notes and wiretap transcripts.</p>
