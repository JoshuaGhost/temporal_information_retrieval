        <p>8:30 P.M. (7) FREDDIE -- Series premiere. Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a Chicago bachelor chef whose life changes when four female relatives (Mädchen Amick, Jacqueline Obradors, Jenny Gago and Chloe Suazo) move in with him. Tonight Freddie and his best friend, played by Brian Green (above right, with Mr. Prinze), once of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' try to meet downscale women at a Laundromat.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (9) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- They thought they didn't have Janice Dickinson to be kicked around by anymore (after Twiggy replaced her as a judge this season), but Ms. Dickinson, the outspoken supermodel, puts in a surprise appearance tonight and makes a model cry. Meanwhile, in the best tradition of reality-competition shows, the contestants are asked to point out one another's worst physical flaws.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (7) LOST -- The survivors from the raft finally learn who their captors are. Hurley (Jorge Garcia) has some trouble in the mysterious underground world of the hatch. Viewers grow impatient about getting some answers.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (9) VERONICA MARS -- Veronica (Kristen Bell), teenage private eye, has another case. Her pal Beaver (Kyle Gallner) suspects his sexy stepmother of having an affair. Charisma Carpenter (above right), the ambitious Cordelia Chase on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel,'' guest-stars as the stepmother.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (MTV) MADE -- Season premiere. A mere beauty-fashion makeover isn't good enough for this series, which has been doing life transformations since 2002. That means turning nerds into jocks, fat girls into cheerleaders, fat boys into chick magnets and class clowns into playwrights. Tonight, a friendless girl from Ohio wants to hang with the cool kids at her new school.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (7) INVASION -- The premise of this series is that natural disasters are smokescreens to disguise the arrival of extraterrestrials. Or something worse. Tonight, as the fictional Homestead, Fla., recovers from the recent hurricane, escaped lab animals may be spreading a deadly flu virus. And a woman suspects a television reporter of not being herself.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (2) CSI: NY -- A debutante is found dead on a carousel in Central Park. The owner of a meatpacking plant is torn to shreds by a tiger. Mac Taylor (Gary Sinise, left) and his team investigate.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Food) GOOD EATS -- Waffles.</p>
