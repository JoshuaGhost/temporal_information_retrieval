        <p>Libeskind's Warsaw Commission</p>
        <p>The architect Daniel Libeskind, who was born in Poland in 1946, is to build a glass-covered, sail-shaped, 630-foot high, 45-story apartment building in the center of Warsaw, the investor behind the tower said yesterday, Agence France-Presse reported. Referring to the Polish heritage of Mr. Libeskind, who became a United States citizen in 1965, the investor, Jean-Claude Moustacakis of the Luxembourg-based company Orco Property Group, said, ''Born in Lodz, Daniel Libeskind wanted to do something in Poland.'' Mr. Libeskind told the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza: ''I designed the building in a way what would be different on all sides. That way it will be more interesting. Clad in glass, it will be lighter, as if it was floating in air.'' Construction of the building (above, an architectural drawing) is expected to begin next year and should be completed by 2008.</p>
        <p>Casting Calls</p>
        <p>It's back to ''Spamalot'' for Hank Azaria. After a leave of absence during the summer to film the Showtime series ''Huff,'' Mr. Azaria will resurface in the roles of Sir Lancelot, the French Taunter, the Knight of Ni and Tim the Enchanter. He will continue in the show until April, as will David Hyde Pierce (Sir Robin, Guard 1 and Brother Maynard), who has extended his contract till then.  Jai Rodriguez, who portrayed Angel in ''Rent'' before he became the culture czar on television's ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' will return to Broadway on Nov. 1, when he assumes the role of Carmen Ghia, the swishy personal assistant in ''The Producers.'' On Oct. 25, John Treacy Egan, the current goofy Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind in the Mel Brooks musical, will take over the role of the conniving impresario Max Bialystock.  Fresh off his victory over Kelly Monaco in the ''Dancing With the Stars'' danceoff, John O'Hurley will hoof his way into ''Chicago'' at the Ambassador Theater in the role of the slick lawyer Billy Flynn on Jan. 16.</p>
        <p>National Gallery Buys Hughes Sketch by Plath</p>
        <p>The National Portrait Gallery of Britain paid $48,500 to buy the only known surviving picture of Ted Hughes by Sylvia Plath at an auction on Monday at Bonhams in London. The pen and ink sketch, inscribed ''Portrait of me, made by Sylvia Plath, circa 1957, Ted Hughes,'' detail left, shows him seated and writing while wearing a dinner jacket and bow tie. Hughes, who gave it to his friend the poet Roy Davids, said it was drawn at Cambridge during the early days of their marriage.</p>
        <p>Literary Laurel</p>
        <p>Andrea Levy has won the best of the best award of the Orange Prize for Fiction for her novel ''Small Island'' (Picador), the BBC reported. Her book was chosen from the first 10 winners of the Orange Prize, established to recognize and promote English-language fiction written by women anywhere in the world. The novel by Ms. Levy, 48, born in England to Jamaican parents, tells of a Jamaican couple who immigrate to England after World War II. The novel won the Orange Prize last year and was named the Whitbread Book of the Year in January.</p>
        <p>Names in the News</p>
        <p>Question: What do Superman and the newborn son of the Academy Award-winning actor Nicolas Cage have in common? Answer: The name Kal-el. As fans of the Man of Steel recall, he was named Kal-el at birth on the planet Krypton. Mr. Cage, an avid collector of comic books who was once in line to play Superman in the movies, gave the name to the son born to him and his wife, Alice Kim Cage, on Monday in New York, Reuters reported. Mr. Cage, who started life as Nicolas Coppola -- he is a nephew of the filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola -- chose the stage name Cage in recognition of the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage.</p>
        <p>A Hindemith Rarity</p>
        <p>A long-lost work by Paul Hindemith (1895-1963) will have its North American premiere when the pianist Leon Fleisher, below, performs with the San Francisco Symphony in Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco tonight, Friday and Saturday. The composition, Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, was discovered in 2002 when a Pennsylvania farmhouse was being prepared for sale after the death of the widow of the pianist Paul Wittgenstein (1887-1961). Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in World War I, commissioned it. Ivan Fischer has been named principal guest conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington under a three-year contract beginning in the 2006-7 season.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Princeton University has chosen Beyer Blinder Belle Architects &amp; Planners, with offices in New York, Washington and Beijing, to develop a long-term plan for its campus. University officials estimate that Princeton, with a physical plant of 9.5 million square feet by next year, will need an additional million square feet between 2007 and 2017, the period covered by the plan.  John Lennon's handwritten draft lyrics for the Beatles song ''I'm Only Sleeping,'' expected to fetch more than $360,000, remained unsold after a Christie's auction last week in London, the BBC reported. A spokeswoman said the auction house was ''surprised and disappointed'' when bids failed to reach the reserve price.  Sarah Brightman will be singing Andrew Lloyd Webber again when Decca Broadway releases ''Love Changes Everything'' on Oct. 25. Her latest volume of Lloyd Webber music includes a Spanish-language version of ''Don't Cry for Me Argentina'' from ''Evita.''  Keely Smith, singing the songs she and Louis Prima popularized during their heyday in Las Vegas in the 1950's, will open the 33rd season of ''Highlights in Jazz'' at 8 p.m. tomorrow at the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center.</p>
