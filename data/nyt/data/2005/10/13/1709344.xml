        <p>So far so good for Earl and NBC. ''My Name Is Earl'' is continuing to give the network what it wants: the sitcom's popularity among 18- to 49-year-olds, combined with the entrenched audience for ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' has lifted NBC to victory in that demographic every Tuesday of the fall season. This week ''Earl'' (12.43 million total viewers) easily won the 9 p.m. half-hour among adults 18 to 49, although ''The Office'' (7.64 million), which follows it, continued to lag, falling behind the second halves of both ABC's ''Commander in Chief'' (15.82 million) and CBS's ''Amazing Race'' (11.35 million) in that age group. CBS won the night in total viewers, led, once again, by ''NCIS'' (15.98 million), which was the most-watched program in prime time. Fox's broadcast of the Los Angeles Angels' win over the Chicago White Sox put the network in fourth place. And WB continues its Tuesday strength: the combination of ''Gilmore Girls'' (5.97 million) and ''Supernatural'' (4.98 million) put the network in second place over all among women 18 to 34, one of its target demographics.</p>
