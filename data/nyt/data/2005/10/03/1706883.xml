        <p>Before he died of lung cancer in 1988, Raymond Carver finished his last book of poetry with a reflective and typically minimalist work called ''Late Fragment,'' which declared that he had achieved what he wanted from life: ''to feel myself beloved on the earth.''</p>
        <p>That's a tall order for Matthew (Nick Sandow) and Marta (Jenna Stern), the desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama of the same name. (The play also explicitly alludes to the poem.)</p>
        <p>''Late Fragment'' begins in a familiar and risky way, with a debris-covered Matthew coming home after surviving the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. There already have been several plays about such recently shell-shocked workers and, because the tragedy carries so much baggage, using it as a backdrop, even an integral one, threatens to capsize any production. After getting trampled on by people fleeing the site, Matthew, a mumbling sad sack, has a pain in the neck and a conviction to be a better husband.</p>
        <p>His wife, however, is concerned with more practical things, like how they are going to make a living. Enter Dorian, a lawyer who feeds on the tragedy of others. Michael Mosley makes the most of his showy role, playing it as a devilish frat boy with a pasted-on smile. He takes advantage of this crumbling marriage by flirting with Marta, who clearly misses affection from her crusty, increasingly eccentric husband.</p>
        <p>Matthew, obsessed by his pains, and Marta are survivors of a sort, and as such they have a somewhat dark view of the world. Marta actually comes off as more vulnerable and lost. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to defuse it with less than credible moments. (Why is the television cameraman walking through the fourth wall?) Ms. Volpe also has a habit of finishing her scenes at the moment when they are finally getting somewhere. This establishes suspense, but after a few unresolved moments, you might start wondering whether these theatrical fragments will add up.</p>
        <p>''Late Fragment'' continues through Oct. 22 at Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212)279-4200.</p>
