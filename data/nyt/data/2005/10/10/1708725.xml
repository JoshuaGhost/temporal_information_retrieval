        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana (''The Other Black Gold,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 3) and David Bodanis (''Gas Lite,'' Op-Ed, Oct. 3), in their suggestions to rid the United States of its oil dependence, do not mention the most obvious route: Build dense, transit-oriented and pedestrian-friendly communities.</p>
        <p>Such communities drastically reduce the need for automobile use by taking advantage of so-called alternative forms of transportation, which pollute less and cost significantly less than personal auto use.</p>
        <p>Also, they provide mobility to the sizable portion of the population that is too old, too young, too poor or disabled to drive a car.</p>
        <p>High-density development also uses significantly less energy than single-family detached housing, which lowers overall energy demand.</p>
        <p>No matter what carbon-based fuel you put in a car or a power plant, that fuel will run out someday. Why can't Americans see that the wasteful age of the detached house and the private auto is past its peak?</p>
