        <p>Gulf Coast Partnership</p>
        <p>The World Monuments Fund, designating New Orleans and the Gulf Coast as the 101st site on its Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, is to announce today a partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation for restoration and sensitive reconstruction of the area. The partnership will be financed by a grant of $200,000 from the American Express Foundation and will focus on assessing damage, presenting options for restoration, starting planning for reconstruction and making certain that funds for long-term preservation can be secured by property owners and others.</p>
        <p>Stars Named for 'Kismet'</p>
        <p>Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie,  below, will star in ''Kismet'' to open the 13th season of ''Encores'' at New York City Center with a run from Feb. 9 through 12. ''Kismet'' will be followed by the Kander and Ebb musical ''70, Girls, 70,'' from March 30 through April 2, and the season will end with George and Ira Gershwin's ''Of Thee I Sing,'' from May 11 through 14.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Eminems publishers have gone to federal court in Detroit to seek an order to prevent five companies from selling ring tones taken from his songs on the Internet, The Associated Press reported. His lawyers said they also plan to sue karaoke companies that sell his songs without obtaining the proper license. ''This is a big business,'' said Howard Hertz, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ''We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.'' With J.D. Fortune, winner of the televised ''Rock Star: INXS'' competition, as the replacement for Michael Hutchence as its lead singer, INXS will begin a 20-date North American tour on Jan. 18 in Vancouver, Reuters reported. The schedule includes performances in Boston on Feb. 10, Atlantic City on Feb. 11, Avery Fisher Hall on Feb. 12 and Washington on Feb. 18.</p>
