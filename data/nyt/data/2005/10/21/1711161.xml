        <p>Rod Serling would have wrapped this mysterioso story about a psychiatrist and a suicidal patient dislocated by time, space and a lot of crazily raked angles into a tight half-hour episode. The director Marc Forster, whose previous films include ''Monster's Ball'' and ''Finding Neverland,'' takes a maximalist approach to this mumbo jumbo, which means that in addition to lots of wacky angles, shiny surfaces, seemingly endless stairs, and sets of twins, triplets and quadruplets, he deploys the unsettling vision of three talented actors -- Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling -- straining credulity and neck tendons in the service of serious claptrap.</p>
        <p>It would spoil the mystery and perhaps some of the accidental fun to reveal the core gimmick recycled here by the screenwriter David Benioff, who also wrote Spike Lee's ''25th Hour.'' Mr. McGregor plays a shrink, Sam Foster, who's partial to tweedy suits with inexplicably short pants, which he likes to wear with inexplicably short socks, leaving exposed a thin strip of ankle flesh. I spent much of this movie pondering those flashing ankles, wondering whether they marked a suspect sartorial trend or offered a clue to the weirdness, something about the doctor not fitting his costume. As it happens, they do offer a clue, mostly that when the mind fixes on ankle flesh it is a sure bet that we are in trouble, or rather the movie is.</p>

        <p>It would spoil the mystery and perhaps some of the accidental fun to reveal the core gimmick recycled here by the screenwriter David Benioff, who also wrote Spike Lee's ''25th Hour.'' Mr. McGregor plays a shrink, Sam Foster, who's partial to tweedy suits with inexplicably short pants, which he likes to wear with inexplicably short socks, leaving exposed a thin strip of ankle flesh. I spent much of this movie pondering those flashing ankles, wondering whether they marked a suspect sartorial trend or offered a clue to the weirdness, something about the doctor not fitting his costume. As it happens, they do offer a clue, mostly that when the mind fixes on ankle flesh it is a sure bet that we are in trouble, or rather the movie is.</p>
        <p>Just how much trouble emerges soon after the film's opening, which intentionally or not echoes that of Krzysztof Kieslowski's ''Blue.'' As in that earlier exploration of loss and liberation, ''Stay'' begins with a catastrophic car accident -- Mr. Forster even borrows Kieslowski's image of a spinning car wheel -- that sets in motion a chain of events. What follows the accident bears no relation to ''Blue'' or any of Kieslowski's other works, though Mr. Forster does his best to try and distract us with all manner of snazzy tricks: in one scene, Ms. Watts, who plays Sam's painter girlfriend, Lila, seamlessly walks off a subway platform and into a kitchen; in another scene, Mr. Gosling's character, Henry, the head case with a death wish, morphs into that of Mr. McGregor.</p>
        <p>Why and how Henry got into Sam's head or vice-versa is the question. (''Hamlet'' figures in here, too.) Whether the mystery finally parses is debatable; less so is the enjoyment that can be had from actors as appealing as these going through even the most familiar of motions and hackneyed of material. As Mr. McGregor proved in ''The Island,'' he can assay a role with both a degree of commitment and a level of ironic detachment; he plays the part and also makes sure you see him doing it. The consummately talented Ms. Watts would be watchable even if she were reciting the tax code in Aramaic (which frankly sounds more entertaining than her last film, ''The Ring Two''), while the same goes for Mr. Gosling, who, like his fans, deserves better.</p>
        <p>''Stay'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some vehicular and gun violence.</p>
        <p>Stay  Opens today nationwide.</p>
