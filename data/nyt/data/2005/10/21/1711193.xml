        <p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld concluded a visit to Beijing on Thursday with an unusual round table with Chinese officers about the two countries' military abilities and intentions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld told students and faculty members at the Academy of Military Sciences here that China's neighbors were worried about its decision to expand its missile forces, and to increase their range.</p>
        <p>China ''is expanding its missile forces and enabling those forces to reach many areas of the world well beyond the Pacific region,'' he said. ''Those advances in China's strategic strike capability raise questions, particularly when there's an imperfect understanding of such developments on the part of others.''</p>
        <p>He said other nations had a right to question whether the Chinese government was forthright about its spending on troops and arms, and the motivation for its growing arsenal.</p>
        <p>He questioned why China and Russia had joined diplomatic forces to try to prompt Central Asian states, especially Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, to evict United States and allied forces from bases on their soil.</p>
        <p>One Chinese officer rejected Mr. Rumsfeld's critique that Beijing's military budget remained a mystery, saying that increases were required to modernize Chinese forces after years of inadequate spending.</p>
        <p>Another officer said that while Mr. Rumsfeld accused China of sending mixed signals about its global intentions, the United States had not been transparent in its reasons for securing access rights to the base in Uzbekistan, nor in saying how long its forces would stay in Central Asia.</p>
        <p>United States reporters traveling with Mr. Rumsfeld were allowed to hear his opening remarks and the first question from a Chinese officer, but were required by the academy's leaders to leave for the rest of the 45-minute discussion.</p>
        <p>Details of the rest of the give-and-take were supplied by Lawrence DiRita, Mr. Rumsfeld's spokesman, who stayed. On Friday, Mr. Rumsfeld is to attend security consultations in Seoul, South Korea, where command arrangements for the joint United States-South Korean force are expected to be discussed.</p>
        <p>The South Korean armed forces are under South Korean command in peacetime, but under United States command in case of war. South Korean leaders say they want to retain command of their forces at all times.</p>
