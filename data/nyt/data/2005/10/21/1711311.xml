        <p>In an unplanned but telling coincidence, state officials laid out two visions yesterday for the future of ground zero: A solemn memorial that deserves worldwide gifts in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And an attractive place to shop.</p>
        <p>There has probably never been a plainer expression of the dual identity of the World Trade Center site, which is to function simultaneously as an indelible marker of the horror of Sept. 11, 2001, and as an economic engine to revive the commercial and retail bustle once generated for Lower Manhattan by the twin towers.</p>
        <p>In a midafternoon meeting just north of Union Square, the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey authorized planning and preliminary design work for about 200,000 square feet of retail space -- roughly half the area of the old trade center shopping concourse -- to be built within the new PATH terminal and transportation hub.</p>
        <p>At almost the same moment, on Wall Street, the nine-month-old World Trade Center Memorial Foundation announced that it had raised $101,031,734 from private sources, 20 percent of its ultimate goal of $500 million, which the foundation chairman, John C. Whitehead, said was a ''formidable'' challenge.</p>
        <p>That is particularly true as construction costs rise, since there is already plenty of work for contractors and a great demand for steel, concrete and other materials. That will only increase with the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, seeking to dispel the impression that the controversy over Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to evict the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center from the site had dampened donors' enthusiasm, the memorial foundation organized a ceremony for the governor to sign a bill allowing New Yorkers to contribute to the foundation through an income tax check-off.</p>
        <p>''We will generate tens of millions of dollars from people across the state who understand the importance of never forgetting,'' the governor said.</p>
        <p>Among the largest contributors identified publicly by the foundation yesterday were:</p>
        <p>The Starr Foundation, which gave $25 million before the recent controversy. Its chairman, Maurice R. Greenberg, is a foundation board member.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank, whose $15 million contribution was also made before the controversy erupted this summer. Josef Ackerman, the chairman of the bank's group executive committee, is on the foundation board.</p>
        <p>The Bank of New York, which gave $10 million last week. Its chairman and chief executive, Thomas A. Renyi, also sits on the foundation board and was the host of yesterday's board meeting and news conference at the bank headquarters.</p>
        <p>Smaller gifts included pledges from all 20 members of the foundation staff, totaling $55,000, said its president and chief executive, Gretchen Dykstra.</p>
        <p>Having passed the $100 million mark, Mr. Whitehead said, the memorial foundation is now eligible to receive the first $100 million of a pledge from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, of which he is also chairman.</p>
        <p>The foundation is to construct and own the memorial proper, centered on two pool-filled voids where the twin towers stood; an underground memorial museum threaded through the original trade center foundations and structural remnants; and an above-ground 9/11 museum that was until recently to have housed the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center. It will also build a performing arts center.</p>
        <p>Just how much the memorial and memorial museums will cost has yet to be set, but it will certainly be far higher than the $350 million estimate from last year. (The underground vehicle screening center planned for the site will cost $537 million alone.)</p>
        <p>For one thing, the above-ground museum has now been folded into the memorial project. For another, generally rising construction costs include a 10 percent ''bump up'' as a result of Katrina, said Thomas H. Rog√©r, a construction executive and board member. A number of organizations allied as the take-back-the-memorial coalition had urged Americans not to contribute to the project as long as the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center were to be housed on the same block as the memorial.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a coalition member, Tim Sumner, said in an e-mail message, ''While no one wants to support the W.T.C. Memorial Foundation's fund-raising more than we do, we are waiting for a clearer idea of content and programming for above and below ground sections of the museum.''</p>
        <p>At the Port Authority meeting, $1.95 million was approved by the board for planning the retail space in the PATH terminal being designed by Santiago Calatrava. The agency also released renderings of how the stores there might look when they open in 2010.</p>
        <p>''It demonstrates how sensitive we're going to be with the memorial,'' said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the authority. ''Santiago has designed it very carefully so you don't lose any of the beauty or the significance of the architecture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ringler added that there would be no retail space within the memorial quadrant.</p>
