        <p>ANDY Milonakis could be a great bowler: he's got the crestfallen look after a gutter ball, the fist-pumping after a strike. His rubbery baby face is by turns deadpan and manic. On his self-titled show on MTV, he has bathed in mustard, mourned luncheon meat and persuaded an old woman to dress as an extraterrestrial chicken for a sketch. The show, which began this summer and is now appearing on MTV2, is a hit among 12-to-18-year-olds.</p>
        <p>And no wonder: Mr. Milonakis, who is nearly 30, looks 12 (because of a hormone condition). He dresses the part, wearing sloppy bangs, oversized shirts, baggy jeans, and loosely tied sneakers, which he did not bother to exchange for bowling shoes when he played at Lucky Strike in Hollywood one recent evening. ''Too lazy,'' he said.</p>

        <p>ANDY Milonakis could be a great bowler: he's got the crestfallen look after a gutter ball, the fist-pumping after a strike. His rubbery baby face is by turns deadpan and manic. On his self-titled show on MTV, he has bathed in mustard, mourned luncheon meat and persuaded an old woman to dress as an extraterrestrial chicken for a sketch. The show, which began this summer and is now appearing on MTV2, is a hit among 12-to-18-year-olds.</p>
        <p>And no wonder: Mr. Milonakis, who is nearly 30, looks 12 (because of a hormone condition). He dresses the part, wearing sloppy bangs, oversized shirts, baggy jeans, and loosely tied sneakers, which he did not bother to exchange for bowling shoes when he played at Lucky Strike in Hollywood one recent evening. ''Too lazy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He brought along the Kimmel brothers -- Jon, a writer on ''South Park,'' and Jimmy, host of the late-night show ''Jimmy Kimmel Live,'' who plucked Mr. Milonakis from online obscurity two years ago by making him a television correspondent. Now Mr. Milonakis has a movie role in ''Waiting,'' a restaurant comedy that opened on Oct. 7.</p>
        <p>On this evening Mr. Milonakis wandered around, blowing out candles in the dining area (''Let's make it a little more sexy in here,'' he said) and doing the robot without provocation. The brothers and Jimmy Kimmel's girlfriend, the comedian Sarah Silverman, divided into teams, and after one game (Jon was sweaty but Jimmy won), they sat down to eat -- dumplings, boneless chicken wings, fried balls of mac and cheese -- and talk shop, comedy style.</p>
        <p>''What would be cool is if you avenged a rapper,'' Mr. Kimmel told Mr. Milonakis, a hip-hop fan who has bribed D.J.'s to play Sizzla, a reggae artist.</p>
        <p>Jon Kimmel considered the comic potential. ''You could just bite someone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Loopiness is the norm on Mr. Milonakis's show -- and in his life. He misplaced his credit card after trying to pick a lock with it the night before. Until Jimmy Kimmel forced him to get a checking account, Mr. Milonakis took his MTV money to a check-cashing place. Even after two years in Los Angeles he's carless.</p>
        <p>But then, he's still in a transitional state: between adolescence and adulthood; between celebrity and anonymity; between New York, where he grew up and tapes his show, and Los Angeles. Living here, he said, ''seems like a big vacation, but the people get on my nerves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milonakis has serious boosters in the Kimmels, the producers of his show.</p>
        <p>''I just want $1 million next season, that's all I want,'' Mr. Milonakis said.</p>
        <p>''What did you make last year -- $350?'' Jon Kimmel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milonakis replied, indignant, ''$355.'' David Spade walked by unnoticed. Not so a group of young women with ironed hair and tiny skirts. Mr. Milonakis perked up when they took the next lane, but did not make a move (the robot excepted). Feeling outnumbered Ms. Silverman slipped out, and the guys were left to boy talk. ''I went to Costco today,'' Mr. Milonakis said. ''I got these pants.''</p>
        <p>Jimmy Kimmel: ''I go to Costco every weekend. It's my favorite part of the week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milonakis: ''When I moved here, he bought me a bed. Was that from Costco?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimmel: ''It was.''</p>
        <p>The brothers and Mr. Milonakis wandered outside Lucky Strike and took in Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
        <p>''See Andy,'' Jimmy Kimmel said, pointing to the stars on the Walk of Fame, ''one day you're going to be right here, between Ernest Torrance and Olive Borden.''</p>
        <p>With a grin Mr. Milonakis said, ''I'll write it in -- in marker.''</p>
