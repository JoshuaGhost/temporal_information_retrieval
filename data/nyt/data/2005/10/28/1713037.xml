        <p>Sony, the troubled electronics giant, reported a 47 percent slide in quarterly profit on Thursday, as sales of television sets and Walkman music players fell and its Hollywood studio failed to produce any big hits.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Tokyo, said net profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 28.5 billion yen, or $247 million at current exchange rates. Sales were flat from the quarter a year earlier at 1.7 trillion yen, or $14.74 billion.</p>

        <p>Sony, the troubled electronics giant, reported a 47 percent slide in quarterly profit on Thursday, as sales of television sets and Walkman music players fell and its Hollywood studio failed to produce any big hits.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Tokyo, said net profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 28.5 billion yen, or $247 million at current exchange rates. Sales were flat from the quarter a year earlier at 1.7 trillion yen, or $14.74 billion.</p>
        <p>Sony would have reported a loss were it not for a one-time gain equivalent to $637 million, the chief financial officer, Nobuyuki Oneda, said at a news conference. The gain resulted from the transfer of part of the company's employee pension plan to the government.</p>
        <p>Sony also reiterated its outlook for a loss of nearly $87 million for the fiscal year ending in March. It would be the company's first annual loss in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Once a name synonymous with innovation, Sony has been slow to capitalize on new trends like portable digital music, where it trails Apple Computer's popular iPod. The company has also struggled to respond to cheaper rivals in lower-wage Asian countries like China that have flooded global markets with television sets, DVD players and other consumer electronics.</p>
        <p>Last month, the chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer, introduced a plan to eliminate jobs and reorganize the company in an attempt to restore some of the creative magic that once made Sony a household name in the United States and a symbol of Japan's manufacturing might.</p>
        <p>Thursday's financial results did not reflect the effects of that plan. But they did underscore the challenges facing Sir Howard in reviving Sony, a sprawling conglomerate with businesses as diverse as semiconductors and auto insurance.</p>
        <p>Success will hinge on his ability to turn around the core electronics business, which provides two-thirds of total revenue. The company attributed much of its lackluster performance last quarter to declining sales of plasma television sets, digital cameras and the Walkman, which competes with iPod.</p>
        <p>Over all, sales in the electronics divisions were flat at 1.2 trillion yen, or $10.4 billion. Electronics had an operating profit equivalent to $150 million, Mr. Oneda said. In answer to a question, he acknowledged that electronics would have lost $390 million to $434 million without the pension transfer.</p>
        <p>He noted a bright spot in Sony's money-losing television division: strong sales in the United States of the new Bravia line of liquid-crystal display TV sets. ''Bravia is doing better than we expected,'' Mr. Oneda said.</p>
        <p>A movie unit, Sony Pictures Entertainment, had an operating loss equivalent to $57.2 million. While box-office revenue was strong last year on the success of ''Spider-Man 2,'' the studio's hope for this year, ''Stealth,'' had a disappointing performance, the company said.</p>
        <p>The games division reported an operating profit of $71.1 million, in contrast to a slight loss a year earlier. Revenue jumped by more than 75 percent, to 214.2 billion yen, or $1.86 billion, as sales of PlayStation Portable, a hand-held gadget, and PlayStation 2 increased.</p>
