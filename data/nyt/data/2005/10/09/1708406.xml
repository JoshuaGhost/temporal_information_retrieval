        <p>The opening of the Time Warner Center a year and a half ago has transformed the area around Columbus Circle into one of the prime dining neighborhoods in the city.</p>
        <p>ALAIN DUCASSEAT THE ESSEX HOUSE  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 265-7300; 155 West 58th Street (Seventh Avenue); $$$$; Review: 2/2/05.  Masa has arguably dislodged it as New York's most expensive restaurant, and Per Se may well have usurped it in terms of an average meal's running time. But for a particular and traditional type of decadence, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House is still the place to go.</p>
        <p>CAFÉ GRAY  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 823-6338; Time Warner Center (third floor) at Columbus Circle; $$$; Review: 12/15/04.  Gray Kunz's new restaurant has a glinting, sparkly, vast dining room that faces an open kitchen. The best of the food here is fabulous, and the menu as a whole is a pleasure-packed testament to Mr. Kunz's nimbleness of imagination and execution.</p>
        <p>JEAN GEORGES  **** [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 299-3900; Trump International Tower, 1 Central Park West (60th Streets); $$$$; Review: 6/6/97, Article: 2/12/03.  In every aspect, from the austere design of the dining room to the pacing of the meal to the quiet professionalism of the staff, the focus at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurant is on the food.</p>
        <p>MASA  **** [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 823-9800; Time Warner Center (fourth floor), Columbus Circle; $$$$; Review: 12/29/04.  Masa, despite its chosen peculiarities and pitiless expense, belongs in the thinly populated pantheon of New York's most stellar restaurants. Simply put, Masa engineers discrete moments of pure elation that few restaurants can match. If you appreciate sushi, Masa will take you to the frontier of how expansively good a single (and singular) bite of it can make you feel.</p>
        <p>PER SE  **** [Rating: Four Stars]  (212) 823-9335; Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle; $$$$; Review: 9/8/04.  The chef, Thomas Keller, lavishes attention on every aspect of a meal. If you can wangle a reservation at one of its 16 tables that puts you in Per Se around dusk and allows you to watch the light fade over Manhattan, do it. The reward is a profound sense of peace that few of this frenetic city's restaurants can offer.</p>
        <p>SAN DOMENICO  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 265-5959; 240 Central Park South (Broadway); $$$$; Review: 8/6/03.  With its high visibility, high prices and general air of luxury, San Domenico has served as a flagship for serious Italian cuisine since it opened in 1988. The kitchen continues to perform marvels.</p>
