        <p>HEALTH officials in the state do not anticipate a repeat of the flu vaccine shortage that last year had residents searching for flu shots.</p>

        <p>HEALTH officials in the state do not anticipate a repeat of the flu vaccine shortage that last year had residents searching for flu shots.</p>
        <p>''There should be enough vaccine for those who want it,'' said William Gerrish, a spokesman for the State Department of Health. ''Local health departments and others are getting the vaccines that they ordered. Things are moving as they should be.''</p>
        <p>He said the department would continue to monitor the supply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerrish said about 20 percent of the flu vaccine used in Connecticut was supplied to public agencies by the state. He said the rest was acquired by doctors and private institutions, such as supermarkets, hospitals and pharmacies.</p>
        <p>Ken Ferrucci, director of government relations for the Connecticut State Medical Society, a nonprofit group that represents doctors throughout the state, said most members had not reported any problems getting the vaccine.</p>
        <p>''They are receiving supplies in a timely fashion and they are comfortable now,'' he said. ''But that was also the case early on last year, so we're watching the situation closely.''</p>
        <p>Gov. M. Jodi Rell issued an emergency order last year that gave the state greater power to manage the limited supply of the vaccine.</p>
        <p>The flu season runs from October through May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency recommends being vaccinated in October or November.</p>
        <p>Those considered at high risk for complications from the flu, according to the C.D.C., are children 6 months to 23 months old, people over 65, pregnant women, people with respiratory difficulties and those who have problems with their immune system.</p>
