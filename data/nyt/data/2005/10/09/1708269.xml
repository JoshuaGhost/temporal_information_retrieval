        <p>Before there were Trump towers dotting every other corner, New York was full of architectural marvels. This is apparent in ''Mythic City: Photographs of New York by Samuel H. Gottscho, 1925-1940,'' on view at the Museum of the City of New York from Nov. 1, 2005, through Feb. 20, 2006. Gottscho offers a glimpse of lost treasures, from the Art Deco Rex Cole showroom in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to the swanky interiors of William Paley's Beekman Place town house. Documenting the city's rapidly changing landscape, Gottscho created dreamlike images with an artist's eye. ''It is ironic, because he was photographing during the height of the Depression,'' says Donald Albrecht, the curator of the exhibit and the author of the accompanying book from Princeton Architectural Press. But his vision, Albrecht says, ''is optimistic and heroic.''</p>
