        <p>After a blistering week, the White House is scrambling to control a conservative uprising over the nomination of Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court, with President Bush pitching his choice directly to the public on Saturday as his Republican allies plotted strategy to shore up support.</p>
        <p>''Harriet Miers will be the type of judge I said I would nominate: a good conservative judge,'' Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address.

        <p>After a blistering week, the White House is scrambling to control a conservative uprising over the nomination of Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court, with President Bush pitching his choice directly to the public on Saturday as his Republican allies plotted strategy to shore up support.</p>
        <p>''Harriet Miers will be the type of judge I said I would nominate: a good conservative judge,'' Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. He added, ''When she goes before the Senate, I am confident that all Americans will see what I see every day: Harriet Miers is a woman of intelligence, strength and conviction.''</p>
        <p>It was the third time since he picked Ms. Miers on Monday that the president has come to her defense. His remarks came as Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who presides over confirmation hearings, offered a blunt assessment that was yet another sign that the nominee faced an uphill battle on Capitol Hill. Though Mr. Specter called Ms. Miers ''intellectually able,'' he said she had a ''fair-sized job to do'' to become fluent in the language of constitutional law, which will be essential for senators who want to examine her judicial philosophy in deciding whether to confirm her.</p>
        <p>''She needs more than murder boards,'' Mr. Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said in an interview, referring to the mock question-and-answer sessions most nominees use to prepare for their confirmation hearings. ''She needs a crash course in constitutional law.''</p>
        <p>The conservative uproar over Ms. Miers underscores how difficult it has been for Mr. Bush to pull his own party together as he faces a variety of problems on other fronts: his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina; a leak investigation involving his chief political adviser, Karl Rove; the indictment of Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who was the House majority leader; and, most recently, the decision by a top Justice Department nominee to withdraw amid questions over his ties to a Republican lobbyist accused of fraud.</p>
        <p>Only a week ago, Republicans were saying they looked forward to a new Supreme Court nominee because it would give them something to rally around, providing a welcome distraction from the Bush administration's problems. But the nomination of Ms. Miers only served to roil a party that is already divided over domestic matters like Social Security and how to pay to rebuild the Gulf Coast.</p>
        <p>Now, having alienated his conservative backers, Mr. Bush must go forward on the Miers nomination alone, without the help of many of the advocates who led the charge for the last nominee, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, Republican allies of the White House said they were trying to put together a public relations strategy to combat the mounting criticism over the Miers nomination. The effort, they said, would include administration officials, the Republican National Committee and conservative advocates who will carry onto television, talk radio and other forums the message that Ms. Miers, the White House counsel and a close confidante of the president, is a strong choice and that Mr. Bush will stand firmly behind her.</p>
        <p>They said the White House was working to assemble a dossier that would back up its case about Ms. Miers' record of accomplishment, her legal qualifications and her conservative credentials. The administration was trying to assemble and review as much documentation as it could find about Ms. Miers's public record before she came to the White House, including details of her service on the Dallas City Council and her role as president of the State Bar of Texas.</p>
        <p>Jim Dyke, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee who has joined the White House to help confirm Ms. Miers, said in an interview she was being seriously underestimated.</p>
        <p>''President of the Texas bar association, president of the Dallas Bar Association, head of a major law firm, those are impressive credentials and they are being summarily dismissed,'' Mr. Dyke said. Asked about Mr. Specter's remark, Mr. Dyke said that as White House counsel, Ms. Miers already had ''a mastery of the Constitution and constitutional law,'' and said she needed to do nothing more than any other nominee to prepare. He added, ''There seem to be some unfair assumptions being made.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush campaigned on a promise that he would choose justices in the mold of Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, two of the court's most reliable conservatives, the selection of Ms. Miers has infuriated conservatives, who have assailed her as a crony who lacks the proper credentials, as well as a clear record on what they regard as some of the most important social issues of the day, including abortion, gay marriage and religion in public life.</p>
        <p>One prominent conservative, the columnist Charles Krauthammer, ridiculed the nomination as ''a joke.'' Mr. Krauthammer wrote, ''The issue is not the venue of Miers's constitutional scholarship, experience and engagement. The issue is their nonexistence.''</p>
        <p>One conservative advocate, Sean Rushton, executive director of the Committee for Justice, said generating enthusiasm for Ms. Miers was proving difficult because ''anytime we put out something positive about her it gets shot to pieces by all our allies and the blogs.''</p>
        <p>Already, the Senate's most ardent opponent of abortion, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, has said he is prepared to vote against Ms. Miers, even if he receives a personal plea from Mr. Bush to support her. And while Ms. Miers does appear to be assuaging the concerns of some Republican senators as she meets with them, Republicans are hardly as effusive in their praise as they were early on for Chief Justice Roberts, whose resume -- he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court as an appellate lawyer -- and ability to discuss intricate matters of constitutional law impressed them greatly.</p>
        <p>''She obviously faces a challenge following John Roberts,'' Mr. Specter said. ''But nobody expects her to be a second John Roberts.''</p>
        <p>Yet before the Miers nomination, some of Mr. Bush's closest allies on Capitol Hill said they did want a second John Roberts. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said at one point that he would ''be pleased if you could clone John Roberts.'' After seeing Ms. Miers this week, Mr. Sessions said he was ''a little bit troubled'' by the conservative criticism, but was taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a valid concern of those who support President Bush that we get the kind of nominee that he promised and that he thinks she is,'' Mr. Sessions said. Of Ms. Miers, he said, ''I don't really feel like I know her. I'd like to know more about her record.''</p>
        <p>With the Senate in recess until Oct. 17, Ms. Miers headed to Dallas, the White House said, to review files from the cases she had handled while in private practice so that she could respond to the Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. Mr. Specter said Republicans and Democrats were still negotiating the questions, but that he had given Ms. Miers the form used in the Roberts confirmation to get her started.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Miers made the rounds on Capitol Hill, at least one Democrat, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, said the nominee had become a victim of sexism. ''They're saying a woman who was one of the first to head up a major law firm with over 400 lawyers doesn't have intellectual heft,'' Ms. Mikulski said.</p>
        <p>Others, like Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the criticism was elitist.</p>
        <p>''I think people have a view of a Supreme Court justice, it's a healthy view, that you should be the best and the brightest,'' Mr. Graham said. ''But to be the best and the brightest, in my opinion, is bigger than your SAT score and where you got your degree.''</p>
        <p>Several Republicans, including Mr. Specter, said they steered clear of asking Ms. Miers questions about constitutional law. Mr. Specter, who said the timing of the confirmation hearings would depend in part on when Ms. Miers felt ready, said he initiated a discussion of the shifting standards the Supreme Court has applied in interpreting the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, but only to illustrate to Ms. Miers the kinds of questions she would face during her hearings.</p>
        <p>''I did not ask her about it because I don't think she's ready to face it at the moment,'' he said. ''Look, the lady was White House counsel dealing with totally other subjects until Sunday night when the president offered her the job. And Monday she's sitting with me. I'm not going to ask her questions which she hasn't had a chance to study or reflect on.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Specter said that did not mean he would go easy on Ms. Miers at the hearings. ''Absolutely not. It would be a disservice to the selection process and to her,'' he said. ''She's got to win her wings.''</p>
