        <p>Some of quarterback Chad Pennington's teammates on the Jets marveled at how he was working out in the weight room earlier this week, looking as if there was nothing terribly wrong with his right shoulder.</p>
        <p>But the reality of Pennington's injury was made clear Thursday, when he had his second arthroscopic surgery in eight months to repair another tear in his right rotator cuff.</p>
        <p>Pennington, 29 and a sixth-year veteran, sustained the injury in the third quarter of the Jets' 26-20 overtime loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 25. He returned to the game after his backup, Jay Fiedler, was sidelined with a dislocated shoulder.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Andrews, a renowned orthopedic specialist based in Birmingham, Ala., performed the surgery. The Jets said Pennington would immediately begin a rehabilitation program under the supervision of Andrews and the team's medical staff.</p>
        <p>Coach Herman Edwards said no timetable had been set for Pennington's recovery. In a statement, the team said it was ''optimistic that with the proper rehabilitation and time for healing, Pennington will be ready for the 2006 season.''</p>
        <p>''I don't answer for Chad,'' Edwards said after speaking to Pennington, ''but I think he feels in his mind that whatever it's going to take for him to come back, he's going to do. That's his mind-set. That's what makes him so special.''</p>
