        <p>The glory years are long gone, fading deeper into memory each fall. The Yankees spoiled themselves, their fans and their principal owner by winning four championships in five seasons through 2000. Now, they have gone five years without one.</p>
        <p>The second half of the Joe Torre era ended with a thud at Angel Stadium on Monday. The $203 million Yankees, the most expensive baseball production ever assembled, left the October stage after one act.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Angels thwarted the Yankees, 5-3, in Game 5 of their American League division series, rattling Mike Mussina with a barrage of soft hits and knocking him out in the third inning. The Yankees were helpless to fight back against the Angels' stingy bullpen, and they have nothing to show for their season but another division title.</p>
        <p>''It shouldn't be satisfying for anyone,'' said Derek Jeter, the team captain, who homered for the Yankees' only run over the last seven innings. ''We don't play just to make it to the playoffs. We've been to the playoffs before. We play to win. We came up short.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had the tying run on base with two out in the ninth, but Angels first baseman Darin Erstad dove to his right to stop a grounder by Hideki Matsui, then flipped to closer Francisco Rodriguez, who barely beat Matsui to the bag for the final out. Fireworks exploded, toilet paper streamed from the upper deck and the Angels mobbed one another.</p>
        <p>Matsui stood alone down the first-base line, overcome by the sobering notion that it would be the Angels, not the Yankees, flying to Chicago to face the White Sox in Game 1 of the A.L. Championship Series on Tuesday. Matsui was 0 for 5 on Monday, leaving eight runners on base.</p>
        <p>''If I had hit in those opportunities, maybe the game would have been a little different,'' Matsui said through an interpreter. ''It's a bitter feeling.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees flew home to an uncertain future in which not even Torre's status as manager is assured. George Steinbrenner, the ever-impatient principal owner, had put the fate of the series in Torre's hands.</p>
        <p>''My feelings are deep disappointment,'' Torre said, adding that this year's defeat felt worse than last year's A.L.C.S. collapse to Boston. ''I don't remember being this disappointed, because I wanted this very badly. I guess that's why you're in the game. It's just -- it's tough. It's tough.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner will surely assign blame somewhere for the Yankees' latest postseason defeat, their second in four years to the Angels in the first round. A team with a much deeper pitching staff stifled some of the Yankees' biggest hitters, and Steinbrenner will want to know why.</p>
        <p>Alex Rodriguez went 2 for 15 in the series, grounding into a double play after Jeter's leadoff single in the ninth. Matsui was 4 for 20 over all. Gary Sheffield had six hits in the series, none for extra bases. Each has been added since the last World Series title, but the Yankees are still waiting to win again.</p>
        <p>''We played so well down the stretch,'' Rodriguez said. ''To end in this fashion, it's disappointing. I played great baseball this year, and I played like a dog the last five games.''</p>
        <p>In Game 5, the Yankees could not capitalize on an early gift: the departure of Angels starter Bartolo Colón, who may win the A.L. Cy Young award but who left the game in the second with an inflamed right shoulder.</p>
        <p>The matchup of Colón, a 21-game winner this season, and Mussina, a 224-game winner in his career, was glitzy only on paper. Colón had complained of back and arm problems in New York over the weekend, and Mussina missed three weeks in September with elbow trouble.</p>
        <p>Neither lasted long. Colón left after six pitches in the second inning, and the Angels killed Mussina softly in the third.</p>
        <p>Colón looked strong enough in the first, buzzing a 95-mile-an-hour fastball past Matsui with two runners on, ending the inning. But after his third pitch of the second inning, Colón was visibly anguished, pacing around the mound and needing a visit from the trainer.</p>
        <p>He tried to stay in, but after three more pitches, the Angels replaced him with Ervin Santana, a hard-throwing rookie right-hander who was not sharp at first. He threw ball four to Robinson Cano, then walked the next two hitters.</p>
        <p>A one-out single by Bubba Crosby and a sacrifice fly by Jeter drove in two runs, but Rodriguez struck out to end the inning with Crosby at second.</p>
        <p>With a 2-0 lead, Mussina immediately started giving it back. He had stayed behind when the series shifted to New York, throwing to the Yankees' bullpen catcher on a local field, but the rest did not seem to make much difference. This was the shortest of Mussina's 20 career postseason starts.</p>
        <p>Garret Anderson led off the bottom of the inning with a home run over the tall wall in right-center, and Bengie Molina dumped the next pitch to left for a single.</p>
        <p>After two outs, Mussina was a pitch from escaping the inning with the lead intact. He ran a full count to Steve Finley but walked him, staring at the home-plate umpire, Joe West, after ball four.</p>
        <p>''The 3-2 pitch was a ball,'' Mussina said, measuring his words. ''But I didn't think Joe had his best game.''</p>
        <p>It was a costly walk for Mussina, because the next hitter, Adam Kennedy, launched a high drive to the wall in right-center.</p>
        <p>Crosby and Sheffield converged on it. Crosby plays an aggressive center field, hustling to the point of recklessness at times. He crashed into Sheffield just as the ball appeared to hit Sheffield's wrist, and it bounced away for a triple as two runs scored. It was 3-2 Angels, and the Yankees never regained the lead.</p>
        <p>''Sheff said he thought, right at the last second, that he was going to catch it, and I thought at the last second that I was going to catch it,'' Crosby said, while declining to answer who called for the ball. ''It was perfectly placed.''</p>
        <p>Now it was Santana's turn to hold a lead. He blanked the Yankees in the third, despite a Sheffield single, then watched his teammates torture Mussina in the bottom of the inning.</p>
        <p>Mussina faced six Angels, and all of them put the ball in play. This is how the Angels drive teams crazy. Only one team in baseball had fewer strikeouts, and while the Angels do not always pile up runs, they prove that anything can happen when bat meets ball.</p>
        <p>''I was making the pitches I wanted to make, but they were fighting them off and putting them in play,'' Mussina said. ''And when you do that, sometimes things happen.''</p>
        <p>Orlando Cabrera led off with a clean single to left, and he was running as Vladimir Guerrero blooped a single into no-man's land in right center. Mussina did not allow another well-hit ball, but he also could not get a strikeout. The Angels created enough chaos to drive him from the game within four batters.</p>
        <p>Anderson flied out to shallow center, and Cabrera scored from third on the sacrifice. The score was 4-2, Angels, and Bengie Molina dumped another blooper into shallow right, putting runners at the corners again. Erstad batted next, with three strikeouts in the series against Mussina, This time, he chopped a ball toward first base, and there was nothing Jason Giambi could do.</p>
        <p>Guerrero slid into home with the Angels' fifth run, well ahead of Giambi's throw, and after a foul out, Randy Johnson came in for Mussina.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who had been hit hard in Game 3, threw four and a third shutout innings. But Santana was nearly as good, shutting out the Yankees from the third through the sixth.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a chance to score in the fifth, when Cano struck out with two out and two on, but scampered to first on an apparent wild pitch. Molina's throw skipped away from Erstad, but West called Cano out for interference. Torre argued, to no avail.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not have an extra-base hit until the seventh, when Jeter homered, but the Angels soon put their bullpen relay team into action. Santana gave way to Kelvim Escobar, who took the ball to Francisco Rodriguez for the save.</p>
        <p>Jeter's single in the ninth could not spark a scoring rally, and when it was over, he had an empty feeling.</p>
        <p>''There's no sense of accomplishment,'' Jeter said. ''We didn't accomplish anything.''</p>
        <p>As Jeter spoke, there was one item sitting oddly in his empty locker: a photograph from an awards show, with Roger Clemens, Jeter and others accepting a trophy after a World Series-winning season. Rodriguez was not in it. Neither were Sheffield, Matsui, Mussina or Johnson.</p>
        <p>It is a much different team now, an awkward era in Yankees history. Another season is over, and all of the millions for all of the mercenaries could not wake the dynasty from the dead.</p>
