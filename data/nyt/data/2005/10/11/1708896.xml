        <p>Let me get this straight. According to John Tierney (''Justice Miers? Get Real,'' column, Oct. 8), Harriet E. Miers is a ''micromanager,'' ''fussing about punctuation,'' among other things.</p>
        <p>As I recall, John G. Roberts Jr., recently confirmed as chief justice, was praised for his thorough attention to detail, exhibited by his editing and correcting of memorandums, among other things.</p>

        <p>Let me get this straight. According to John Tierney (''Justice Miers? Get Real,'' column, Oct. 8), Harriet E. Miers is a ''micromanager,'' ''fussing about punctuation,'' among other things.</p>
        <p>As I recall, John G. Roberts Jr., recently confirmed as chief justice, was praised for his thorough attention to detail, exhibited by his editing and correcting of memorandums, among other things.</p>
        <p>Regardless of Ms. Miers's qualifications for the Supreme Court, or lack thereof, her alleged tendency to review punctuation is an asset, not a liability, and a fast-fading skill. In law, as in literature, a misplaced comma may change everything.</p>
