        <p>What do you do after you have purchased your 100-foot mega-yacht? You shop around for one or two 25-foot inflatable boats as tenders.</p>
        <p>The annual boating trade fair opened here on Oct. 8 and closed on Oct. 16, the largest in a series of big boat shows that stretch from Cannes, France, to Monaco to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
        <p>This year, big is beautiful, and everyone seemed to be promising even bigger next year.</p>
        <p>And that brings relief to Europeans, for they closely watch boating fairs like Genoa's to judge the overall health of their economy. In the boom years of the 1990's, prosperity attracted customers who might never before have thought of themselves as yacht owners.</p>
        <p>But the stock market reversal and, above all, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, slowed the industry. Now with striking new models and bigger, more fully equipped boats, the industry is trying to lure customers back to the water, and the signs are that they are coming.</p>
        <p>At BWA Nautica, the big Italian maker of inflatable boats, one star of the show was its 28-foot inflatable craft. With two outboards to drive it, the boat sells for $105,000. Next year, the company will have its 39-foot model ready. How do you inflate it?</p>
        <p>''With an electric air pump, in 15 minutes,'' said Marco Paradiso, BWA's director of sales. He added: ''Don't try to use your foot.''</p>
        <p>Across the harbor of this Mediterranean port, representatives of the big Finnish Nautor Swan yards were showing their custom 75-foot sailing yacht, which can be had for $4.7 million, with fine wood finishing outside and in, and chock-full of the latest electronic equipment.</p>
        <p>''The owner is in finance,'' said Paola Ciribilli, a company official, ''so he wants to work on board night or day. So there's a satellite link for video and Internet.''</p>
        <p>Larry Ebbs, operations manager for International Yacht Collection, brokers and builders of yachts in Fort Lauderdale, said: ''In general, mega-yachts, in the 80- to 100-foot range, have been pretty robust the past couple of years. There's a kind of 'my boat's bigger than your boat' syndrome out there. The market's quite healthy.''</p>
        <p>Are boats tending to get bigger? ''The answer is yes,'' he said. Of course, the builders of what have come to be called giga-yachts -- even bigger boats of 400 feet to 500 feet -- prefer the Monaco boat show, which just preceded Genoa. Still, the best-known builders below that category were all here.</p>
        <p>The high price of oil, which yachts burn as fuel, did not seem to worry anyone. Fulvio Dodich, chief executive of Ferretti Yachts, a unit of the Ferretti Group of Italy, described his customers as ''middle-tier millionaires,'' adding that 17 percent of them had liquid financial assets of more than $100 million. ''Fuel consumption is not that important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the health of the American market affects how European boat builders fare. Ferretti, Italy's biggest yacht builder, does about 20 percent of its business in the United States.</p>
        <p>European yacht builders have made their deepest mark in the American market for sailboats, but they are running to catch up with powerboats as well.</p>
        <p>To do so, yacht builders from Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere have increasingly transformed the business into a high-end branch of the luxury goods arena by creating yachts that are to sailing what Ferraris or Porsches are to driving.</p>
        <p>''Last year and this year, the market has been improving,'' said Bruce Qvale, president of Chris-Craft Europe, which unveiled its 36-foot Corsair, already available in the United States and soon to be on the market in Europe for $488,000. He said buyers of giga-yachts also bought modest boats like the Corsair. ''They're easier to get around in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Genoa show features tiny runabouts and immense yachts like the 110-foot Revitality, sold by the Baglietto yards of Italy for about $12 million. There are cute boats and ominous Darth Vader craft all in black.</p>
        <p>European governments have recently made efforts to revive the marine market, in part to offset the loss of shipbuilding jobs in coastal regions. Italy and France have introduced tax changes so that customers who lease rather than buy craft bigger than 32 feet do not pay the value-added tax.</p>
        <p>That translates into a saving of 10 percent to 20 percent. Hence, leasing has boomed, and banks and leasing companies were out in force.</p>
        <p>''For the last three years, the marine market has been growing; it's no longer in crisis,'' said Franco Frigerio, a banker with Banca Italease, a division of Banca Popolare Italiana. And thanks to Europe's common market, individual customers and charter companies from other parts of Europe are flocking to Italy and France to shop.</p>
        <p>''It's a real boom,'' said Mr. Frigerio. Now marine leasing accounts for 7 percent of his bank's $14 billion loan portfolio, he said.</p>
        <p>Still, with so many boats on the market, competition is fierce among boat builders, and some have began casting about to build boats more cheaply in Eastern Europe or Asia.</p>
        <p>Quicksilver and Arvor, units of the Brunswick Corporation, have begun designing and building boats in Poland; the Delphia unit of the Italian boat builder Comar is now selling about 80 to 90 boats a year that are built as well at yards in northern Poland.</p>
        <p>''Building costs are 30 percent less, even though you have the same standards,'' said Flaminia Palazzo, Comar's export sales director. With wages in Poland 8 to 10 times less than in Western Europe, ''it's a fantastic product to compete against other European yards,'' she said. The company had the idea because most of the workers at its yards in Italy are now Poles.</p>
        <p>Still, few industry executives see a quick rush to move manufacturing capacity into Asia or Eastern Europe. Small craft like those manufactured by Quicksilver and Comar may benefit from the region's low wages.</p>
        <p>''Can a luxury item be manufactured in China or Poland or the Czech Republic?'' asked Mr. Dodich of Ferretti. ''We don't think so. You're guaranteed design, Italian style, a good feel, comfort, because you're buying a real Italian luxury product.''</p>
        <p>Yet, he added, Eastern Europe, including Russia, and Asia, including China, remain vast undeveloped markets for Western European boat builders. Above all, he said, China remains the Big Rock Candy Mountain.</p>
        <p>''It's a huge market that's important for the marine business,'' he said, adding that he visited China in 1996 and that Ferretti now had dealers in Qingdao and Shanghai. But he said lack of infrastructure, like marinas and boating facilities, hampered growth.</p>
        <p>''They are starting only now building new infrastructure, the same as in the Mediterranean,'' Mr. Dodich said. ''It's a market to look at with seriousness.''</p>
