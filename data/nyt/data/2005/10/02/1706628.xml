        <p>AS September comes to an end, dusk arrives sooner, the lamps in the windows of the apartments on Riverside Drive go on earlier, and the evenings when I could sit and read for twilit hours on the benches high above the Hudson have vanished for the year.</p>
        <p>Vanished, too, is the world of my grandparents, part of that group of thousands of refugees from Hitler's Germany and Austria who in the mid-1930's made these streets of the Upper West Side their own. Yet they are always with me, my grandparents, and never more than in fall, at Rosh Hashana, which this year will be celebrated starting tomorrow at sundown, and on the Day of Atonement, the following week. I grieve for them, for the comfortable lives they had to leave in Frankfurt, and for the lives they fashioned on a rough, inhospitable new continent.</p>

        <p>AS September comes to an end, dusk arrives sooner, the lamps in the windows of the apartments on Riverside Drive go on earlier, and the evenings when I could sit and read for twilit hours on the benches high above the Hudson have vanished for the year.</p>
        <p>Vanished, too, is the world of my grandparents, part of that group of thousands of refugees from Hitler's Germany and Austria who in the mid-1930's made these streets of the Upper West Side their own. Yet they are always with me, my grandparents, and never more than in fall, at Rosh Hashana, which this year will be celebrated starting tomorrow at sundown, and on the Day of Atonement, the following week. I grieve for them, for the comfortable lives they had to leave in Frankfurt, and for the lives they fashioned on a rough, inhospitable new continent.</p>
        <p>Their territory extended from 72nd Street to the northern tip of Manhattan, a swath then called Frankfurt on Hudson or the Fourth Reich. Just before an autumn sunset, one could walk along the drive or down West End Avenue or up Broadway, the diaspora's haupstrassen, and hear snatches of German as one passed other strollers. Today, the families with young children who have replaced my grandparents' generation seem like interlopers, and I often feel like an intruder in my own neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Of a width generous enough to evoke for émigrés their lost cities, Broadway was noisy and crowded, its sidewalks filled with shoppers. The Broadway stores that I remember are no longer: Rappaport's, for party dresses; Barton's Bonbonniere, dating to its founding in the 1930's by a Viennese refugee; Armstead drugstore, around the corner from my grandparents' apartment; Daitch dairy, where all the cheese was sliced to order; Joe's, a kosher butcher; Mrs. Furst's candy store, with baskets of marzipan potatoes and strawberries; and every few blocks, a Cakemaster bakery and shops selling cotton housedresses.</p>
        <p>Congregation Ramath Orah on 110th Street, one of the two synagogues that I recall, was my grandparents' temple. Nothing like their huge, ornate synagogue in Frankfurt's Westend, Ramath Orah was small and plain, with fraying maroon pew cushions and no organ. It still holds services.</p>
        <p>Much of my grandparents' staid and quiet street looks as it did when I knew it as a child in the 1950's. Their 15-story apartment house on West End Avenue at 104th Street was one of scores of solid, pre-Depression-era apartment buildings that line West End Avenue and Riverside Drive. For almost 30 years, my grandfather's sign -- ''Berthold Bachrach, M.D.'' -- was nailed to the facade.</p>
        <p>On summer and early fall nights, their pink-and-black marble-floored lobby was deliciously cool and smelled of age, of my grandfather's cigar, of roasting capon and of the river just a block away. When the doorman wasn't needed to run the elevator, he often napped in his mock-Tudor chair.</p>
        <p>Theirs was typical of prewar apartments now coveted: long hallways, doors with glass knobs shaped like engagement-ring diamonds, smallish rooms with light fixtures in the center of the ceiling, ridiculously small closets. The one big closet was illuminated by a bare bulb worked with a string. It was a corner apartment, and its windows faced north for cool light and west for sun-filled afternoons.</p>
        <p>My grandparents' four rooms resembled those in a Biedermeier-filled Frankfurt-am-Main flat of the 1920's, as if as emigrants starting over, they had hurriedly and inexpensively tried to re-create the surroundings they had fled. The living room furniture was oak-colored, massive. A round glass-topped end table was heaped with copies of Aufbau, the newspaper for the German-speaking displaced, along with copies of Quick and Stern. Bookcases curved to fit into the corners housed volumes of Goethe as well as my grandfather's Merck Manual and medical journals, since the room also served as his consulting room. In the top drawer of his desk, he kept his World War I medal.</p>
        <p>An upright piano on which my grandmother played Lehar and Strauss waltzes stood in a hallway leading to the kitchen. The kitchen, too, was decidedly vintage, with built-in white wooden cabinets, enough space for an ugly brown metal table that could seat six, a sink on four spindly legs, and a stove that would have looked old-fashioned in a 1939 showroom. It was a kitchen stocked for real cooking, with cardamom and Dutch cocoa, poultry shears and Bundt pans.</p>
        <p>There were incongruously luxurious touches, beautiful things that my grandparents had contrived to bring out of Frankfurt. Their living room walls were decorated with perfectly framed oil paintings depicting what could have been scenes of the German countryside. Their living room rug was a deep, rich ruby and blue, their flatware heavy and intricately chased, their tablecloths and napkins delicately laced-edged or pale, thick linen. As an adult, I could look at their table set for Passover or Rosh Hashana and imagine their Frankfurt dining room.</p>
        <p>MY grandfather ushered in Yom Kippur at Ramath Orah, where every seat would be filled. My grandmother, lipstick discreetly reapplied, listened to the Kol Nidre service on WQXR while she dried the dinner dishes in the enormous white-tiled kitchen. After attending services on the day of the holiday, clusters of hatted and, in the case of women, gloved émigrés passed the hours of the sunset-to-sunset fast by walking along Riverside Drive, as they had in the parks of Frankfurt and Berlin.</p>
        <p>My grandmother, who died in 2000 at the age of 94, had gotten a job sewing flowers onto hats in a factory in the West 40's until my grandfather, then in his 50's, learned enough English to pass New York State's medical licensing exam. Their move to then-elegant West End Avenue in 1940 was a step up from a rooming house in the West 90's, a move to the apartment that my grandmother would occupy for her remaining 60 years.</p>
        <p>My grandparents found no pleasure in their marriage, their bickering long having given way to indifference and the separate lives that they eventually led. After my grandmother's death, I came across only one photograph of the two of them alone together: taken on their 1924 honeymoon in Italy, it shows a tall, well-favored blond man on the verge of middle age with his arm around a much shorter, much younger woman whose strong features are just right for the cloche hat on her head.</p>
        <p>Their only child, my mother, made an early, sad and ultimately tragic marriage and died at 33. Her four daughters usually found better things to do than to spend time with these two gentle spirits, who, I supposed we assumed, would be there forever, in their now-shabby rooms.</p>
        <p>Especially around the Day of Atonement, I am preoccupied with memories of them, and with should-haves. I should have been more attentive to my grandfather in his last years. I should have told him, over and over, how much I loved him. I should have bought the apartment next to mine for my grandmother when she was alone. I should have taken her more meals, found her better doctors. I should have been more generous with her about the details of my life.</p>
        <p>I stay as long as I can on my perch on the drive. But the sun has almost set, and the light over the river has faded. Summer's warmth has finally gone, and it really is time to go home.</p>
