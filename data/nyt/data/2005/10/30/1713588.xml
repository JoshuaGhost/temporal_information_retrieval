        <p>TO become rich, the rich will tell you, takes equal parts hard work, risk and resilience, which, it turned out, were also the qualities required at the Real Estate Wealth Expo, an exhaustive crash course in real estate investing sponsored by the Learning Annex and held last weekend at the Jacob K.

        <p>Over two days, about 47,500 people crowded into the labyrinthine conference rooms and vast lecture halls for courses covering subjects like flipping properties, buying real estate on eBay and ''How to Make Big Money in Auctions and Foreclosures,'' a seminar taught by Dr. Al Lowry, ''The Dean of Real Estate Investing!'' as the program noted.</p>

        <p>TO become rich, the rich will tell you, takes equal parts hard work, risk and resilience, which, it turned out, were also the qualities required at the Real Estate Wealth Expo, an exhaustive crash course in real estate investing sponsored by the Learning Annex and held last weekend at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.</p>
        <p>Over two days, about 47,500 people crowded into the labyrinthine conference rooms and vast lecture halls for courses covering subjects like flipping properties, buying real estate on eBay and ''How to Make Big Money in Auctions and Foreclosures,'' a seminar taught by Dr. Al Lowry, ''The Dean of Real Estate Investing!'' as the program noted.</p>
        <p>By Sunday evening, when the headliner, Donald Trump, was scheduled to speak, a kind of get-rich-quick fatigue had set in. An audience of 4,000 sat on folding chairs in the cavernous Keynote Hall 3A, laconically sipping Cokes and listening to Mr. Trump's warm-up act, a commercial real estate investor with a thin smile named J. Scott Scheel.</p>
        <p>''Folks, how many of you would like to make $300,000 on a wholesale quick flip?'' Mr. Scheel asked. There was a muted response. ''This guy was supposed to be finished a half hour ago,'' one man complained.</p>
        <p>After quoting John D. Rockefeller and Cicero, Mr. Scheel finished his lecture and, in a theatrical flourish, stood on a table in the back of the hall, welcoming people to buy his Colo$$al Ca$h System. Despite the price -- $1,497 -- a small crowd stood around him waving sign-up contracts.</p>
        <p>''I want a different lifestyle for myself,'' said one woman who had signed up for the course. She said she worked at Verizon and would identify herself only as Ms. Green, because she didn't want co-workers to know her business. ''About two weeks ago, I realized that things aren't working for me. I'm not 30 anymore. I want to retire in three years. And if not three, then seven.'' In addition to the $499 she paid to the Learning Annex, she spent $5,000 on three investment courses. ''I guess everybody wants to be a millionaire,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, the crowd took their seats and Robert Kiyosaki, the author of ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad,'' introduced the keynote speaker. A cascade of gold-colored balloons floated down from the rafters as Mr. Trump, in a dark suit and purple tie, walked to the lectern to the tune of the O'Jays song ''For the Love of Money,'' the theme song of Mr. Trump's television reality show, ''The Apprentice.''</p>
        <p>The theme of Mr. Trump's speech was ''Think Big'' and demonstrating this, he gently ribbed the people who had arrived late and had to watch his speech on screens in satellite rooms: ''Tells you something about location.'' He then delivered hard-won pearls of wisdom that blended the universal (''Stay focused,'' ''Never, ever, ever give up'') with advice that seemed to carry a more personal significance (''Always have a prenuptial agreement.'')</p>
        <p>His trademark oratory style, a blend of self-aggrandizement, attacks on his competitors and backhanded compliments to his friends and business associates, was much on display. Finally, after a quick round of questions, he left expo attendees with this advice: ''To be a winner, you have to think like a winner. And you're all winners.''</p>
