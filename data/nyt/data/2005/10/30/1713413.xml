        <p>In a small stall on Hotorget, a pedestrian plaza in the center of downtown Stockholm, Olle Collin sells bracelets that are decidedly Swedish: handmade strips of reindeer leather decorated with woven strands of pewter and silver, fastened with a disc of reindeer bone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collin and others like him do business in Stockholm's many street markets, which are especially numerous in November and December as the winter holidays approach. His bracelets come from Lulea and Arvidsjaur in far northern Sweden, the homeland of the Sami people.</p>

        <p>In a small stall on Hotorget, a pedestrian plaza in the center of downtown Stockholm, Olle Collin sells bracelets that are decidedly Swedish: handmade strips of reindeer leather decorated with woven strands of pewter and silver, fastened with a disc of reindeer bone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collin and others like him do business in Stockholm's many street markets, which are especially numerous in November and December as the winter holidays approach. His bracelets come from Lulea and Arvidsjaur in far northern Sweden, the homeland of the Sami people.</p>
        <p>The Sami are the country's indigenous inhabitants, sometimes known outside Scandinavia as the Lapps. They remain celebrated for handicrafts that are both utilitarian and decorative. The reindeer leather and pewter bracelets originated in Sami designs and are made all over Sweden. The patterns woven from the metal threads often echo those found in Sami carvings.</p>
        <p>Swedish artisans began making the bracelets with pewter and silver (above) roughly a century ago, Mr. Collin said, though archaeologists have found thousand-year-old examples made with gold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collin's bracelets range in price from 140 to 360 kronor (about $18 to $45 at 8 kronor to the dollar), depending on their width and the intricacy of the design. The leather is mostly black or brown, though a few white or red varieties can also be found.</p>
        <p>More ornate examples grace the shelves at the nearby shop of the Society for Swedish Handicrafts (Svensk Hemslojd), an artisans' cooperative that also offers traditional textiles, pottery and works in other media. The society sells bracelets from 200 kronor, including some made from leather dyed red or green with matching beads sewn among the pewter strands. There are also triple-wide cuffs in black leather for 1,225 kronor. Many Sami handicrafts are useful items drawn from the households of the reindeer-herding culture, like knife handles or storage vessels. By contrast, the bracelets are intended only as an adornment.</p>
        <p>The Hotorget market (above) is open from dawn to 6 p.m on weekdays and to at least 4 p.m. on weekends. Svensk Hemslojd, at Sveavagen 44, is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m on weekdays and to 3 p.m. on Saturday; (46-8) 23 21 15; www.svenskhemslojd.com.</p>
