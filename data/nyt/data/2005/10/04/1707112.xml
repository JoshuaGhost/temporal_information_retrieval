        <p>''Just Like Bush,'' a 30-second commercial for United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey, began running on Friday on cable and network television stations in Philadelphia and New York.</p>
        <p>PRODUCERS -- S.D.D. Media and Message &amp; Media.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The advertisement begins with sinister music, and a narrator providing a voice-over to the text on the screen, and asking the rhetorical question, ''Who is the only candidate to raise property taxes 200 percent?'' A small moving image of the Republican candidate, Douglas R. Forrester, appears on the screen. The ad then shifts to a still photo in a purplish and pinkish hue of Mr. Forrester standing with President Bush, waving from Air Force One. As the narrator makes the argument that Mr. Forrester and Mr. Bush share the same agenda, various boldfaced statements scroll across the screen, as if hammered out by a typewriter. The ad concludes with the text in the biggest font yet, and on three lines: Doug Forrester George Bush's Choice for Governor Is He Yours?</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Question: Who's the only candidate for governor who has raised property taxes? Answer: Doug Forrester. As a mayor and councilman, Forrester raised property taxes 200 percent. Now, just like George Bush, Forrester has proposed a tax plan that gives tax breaks to the wealthy, which will lead to deep cuts in education, health care, and emergency responders here in New Jersey. Doug Forrester: He's George Bush's choice for governor. Is he yours?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- It is true that Mr. Forrester raised property taxes 200 percent while he served as mayor and a councilman in West Windsor. But Mr. Forrester has said that he did so to pay for a sewer system, which in turn has increased property values -- something that people in West Windsor may feel was a worthwhile investment. Given the fact that Mr. Forrester has pledged not to raise property taxes, and does not seem inclined to tackle the thorny issues of school financing that academics say is at the heart of the state's high property taxes, it is hard to see how he could avoid at least some cuts to various programs, like education or health care.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Well, you can't accuse the Corzine campaign of being too original in this one. ''Just Like Bush'' uses the same material, essentially, from an earlier ad on Mr. Forrester's property tax record in the first 15 seconds, then uses the same material, basically, from another ad on the ties between Mr. Forrester and Mr. Bush for the remaining 15 seconds. And while such repetition reinforces the message that Mr. Corzine wants to get out, over and over and over again, this ad almost feels like political Tupperware: Mix together some perennial favorites, reheat it in a slightly different package, and hope that you satisfy as many people as you can.</p>
