        <p>In my daughter's circle of friends, one 3-year-old named Jared can reel off the names of all the planets. He and his parents are pretty proud, justly in my estimation, of this achievement. Little does he know, however, that the lords of astronomy are working against him.</p>
        <p>For the last 18 months, a committee appointed by the International Astronomical Union has been pondering in frustrating exactitude whether the word ''planet'' means anything anymore.</p>
        <p>Last month Nature reported that the committee was ready to propose dumping the bare term ''planet'' in favor of an expanded, more embellished set of terms like ''terrestrial planets,'' ''trans-Neptunian planets'' and so forth.</p>
        <p>But that turned out to be a false alarm, according to the committee's chairman, Iwan Williams of Queen Mary College in London. He said in an e-mail message that although a majority favored the redefinition many other ideas were blooming and contending so fractiously that he despaired of ever reaching general agreement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Williams said, ''Up to this point I have been hoping for a consensus, but I guess we might need to go for a majority vote.''</p>
        <p>The solar system is much more complicated now, astronomers say, than in 1930 when Clyde Tombaugh added Pluto to the inventory of wandering lights circling the Sun. In addition to Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto, schoolchildren now learn that there are also comets and asteroids bumping about in the night.</p>
        <p>But there are also the Oort cloud, a hypothesized halo of cometary bits hibernating in deep, deep space, and the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. Not mention the dozens of moons circling the planets.</p>
        <p>Pluto is the big problem. Is it a planet or not? Some astronomers have long argued that its small size, less than one-fifth the diameter of Earth, and a weird tilted orbit that takes it inside Neptune every couple hundred years make Pluto more like a Kuiper Belt body than a full-fledged planet.</p>
        <p>A furor arose five years ago when my colleague Kenneth Chang reported that the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York had demoted Pluto, calling it a ''Kuiper Belt object'' rather than a planet.</p>
        <p>The controversy became more desperate this summer when astronomers discovered a new object larger than Pluto orbiting in the Kuiper Belt at a distance of nine billion miles from the Sun. Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology, its discoverer, has said it will be fine with him if Pluto is demoted to a minor planet, but, he argues, if Pluto is a planet, so is the new object, which he nicknamed Xena, making it the 10th planet. Last Friday Dr. Brown announced that Xena has a tiny moon, making it seem even more planetlike.</p>
        <p>Brian Marsden, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, directs the astronomical union's Minor Planet Center, a clearinghouse for solar system discoveries, thinks that both Pluto and Dr. Brown's Xena should be called minor planets. He is one of those who support the idea of categorizing planets into groups. But according to Dr. Williams, other members of the panel have championed other ideas, for example, that planets should be larger than 2,000 kilometers (or about 1,250 miles) in diameter (Pluto is about 1,500 miles)</p>
        <p>Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, of the Rose Center, who is not a member of the astronomical union committee, said the proposed naming scheme sounded a lot like the museum's system. He said, however, that the need to assign adjectives to the word ''planet'' might mean it was time to retire the term altogether.</p>
        <p>Asked what he would replace it with, Dr. Tyson said he hoped the geologists could come up with something and offered up words like ''terrestrials,'' for balls of dirt and rock like Earth; ''Jovians,'' for giant gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn; comets; and so forth.</p>
        <p>Not only did the panel members disagree on the definition of a planet, at last report they could not even agree, it seemed, on whether they were making progress. Within the space of a few minutes the other week, I received one e-mail message from Dr. Marsden saying he was optimistic and another from Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington complaining that his morning e-mail gave him no sense that they were close to bringing the issue to a close.</p>
        <p>In another e-mail message, Dr. Boss described the process as ''like trying to shovel frogs into a wheelbarrow -- they keep jumping out again.''</p>
        <p>The new object, now known poetically as 2003 UB313, is destined to languish nameless until the astronomical union panel comes to a conclusion and thus decides which part of the astronomical bureaucracy is responsible for major planets or minor planets, will have to approve a new name.</p>
        <p>''Every time it looks as though we might be approaching a consensus, rather severe disagreement has a way of breaking out again,'' Dr. Marsden said. ''It is all very unfortunate.''</p>
        <p>Even the idea that a majority of the committee was leaning anywhere was hotly disputed by S. Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is the principal investigator of a coming National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stern has suggested that the criterion of planethood be roundness -- a body big enough for gravity to have conquered geological and mechanical forces. That would include in the roll call of planets not only Pluto, but dozens of objects he thinks are yet to be discovered out in the Kuiper Belt.</p>
        <p>''I think it'll be obvious very shortly that dwarf planets surely outnumber the planets our fathers' generation thought of as the mainstream,'' Dr. Stern, 47, said. If it should turn out in the years to come that Earth is not actually a very good example of a planet, that would not be the first instance in which astronomers have painted themselves into a corner, linguistically.</p>
        <p>Being limited to looking in the practice of their science, astronomers tend to characterize and classify new phenomena by their appearances, their colors, for example. Objects that resemble one another then get lumped together under the name of their progenitor until enough differences accumulate to start a new category.</p>
        <p>So it was that a starlike object known as BL Lacertae, the progenitor of a kind of exploding galaxy, was eventually said to not be a good example of a BL Lacertae object.</p>
        <p>Astronomers are not alone in having a silly name problem, but they may be alone in agonizing so much about it. Physicists have shown little restraint in creating names like neutrinos, quarks, squarks, gluons, photinos, selectrons, strangeness and charm, not to mention strings and branes.</p>
        <p>No commission regulates what physicists call things. ''Basically physicists are too undisciplined to let anyone else tell us what to name something,'' said Gordon Kane of the University of Michigan. ''It's mainly whatever name catches on.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Williams of the astronomical union said there was no deadline for his committee's decision on planetary nomenclature. The urgency, he said, comes from the need to find a way of giving Dr. Brown's Xena an official name. Early this week Dr. Williams circulated a new proposal, defining anything with a radius of more than 1,000 kilometers (roughly Pluto) as a planet, asking for a vote within two weeks. So far there are no indications of a groundswell.</p>
        <p>Dr. Boss of the Carnegie Institution, who favors and hopes that the adjective-planet compromise will catch on in astronomy, said he thought the public would be ''thrilled'' to realize that astronomy had progressed so far as to require a re-sorting of the primary components of the solar system. ''Science marches on,'' he said, ''and this brouhaha is a sterling reminder of both the joy and the pain of this process.''</p>
        <p>I cannot argue with his logic and his desire for clarity. But at the risk of being a curmudgeon, and in the interest of 3-year-olds everywhere who are reaching for a basic comprehension of how the universe is put together and where they stand, I think the astronomers should take a page from the lawyers and jurists we're hearing so much from these days.</p>
        <p>I think they should adopt ''stare decisis,'' Latin for ''stand by that decided.''</p>
        <p>By precedent Pluto is a planet. If we agree on that, then we can look forward to many more planets.</p>
        <p>There were smiles all around the office here when the putative 10th planet was announced last July. There is something ennobling and hopeful about living at a time when a 10th planet is added to the solar system, and maybe an 11th and 12th as planned surveys of the trans-Neptunian void are carried out. It is like being young again and finding out your family is larger than you thought.</p>
        <p>It is like living in an expanding universe.</p>
        <p>Like a Smaller Earth-Moon System, 10th Planet Has Its Own Orbiter</p>
        <p>The 10th planet has a moon.</p>
        <p>Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, who discovered the planet, 2003 UB313, an object in the outer solar system bigger than Pluto, announced on Friday that it has a small moon circling it.</p>
        <p>Since Dr. Brown gave the planet the unofficial nickname Xena, after the main character of a television series about a Greek warrior princess, he called the moon Gabrielle, after Xena's sidekick on the show. Dr. Brown has not yet divulged his proposal for the official name of 2003 UB313.</p>
        <p>Gabrielle, one one-hundredth as bright as the planet it circles, was spotted in a photograph taken Sept. 10 at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. More observations are needed to pin down its orbit. Dr. Brown says that it is about 25,000 miles from Xena and takes one to three weeks to complete an orbit.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing is like the Earth-Moon system scaled down by a factor of 5 or 10,'' Dr. Brown said. ''It's kind of a cool story.''</p>
        <p>The findings have been submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
        <p>A precise determination of Gabrielle's orbit will allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the 10th planet. Moons apparently are not rare in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune. Astronomers have now found moons around three of the largest Kuiper Belt objects: Pluto, the 10th planet, and 2003 EL61, another large body spotted by Dr. Brown.</p>
        <p>That suggests Pluto is not as much an oddball as once thought. ''You are finally learning a little more what's going on out there,'' Dr. Brown said.</p>
