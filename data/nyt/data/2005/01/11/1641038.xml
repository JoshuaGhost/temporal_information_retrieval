        <p>Q. Can hummingbirds really fly backward?</p>
        <p>A.Yes, as well as sideways, straight up and down, and even very briefly upside down. Often described as living helicopters, hummingbirds have adaptations of musculature, wing shape and metabolism that let them hover in place and make their other unusual flying patterns possible.</p>

        <p>Q. Can hummingbirds really fly backward?</p>
        <p>A.Yes, as well as sideways, straight up and down, and even very briefly upside down. Often described as living helicopters, hummingbirds have adaptations of musculature, wing shape and metabolism that let them hover in place and make their other unusual flying patterns possible.</p>
        <p>To hover over the delicate flowers that provide the nectar they feed on, some small hummingbirds beat their wings up to 80 times a second. To keep up this punishing pace, their hearts beat up to 1,260 times a minute. They also have very fast metabolisms and must feed almost continuously.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important for their hovering skills, their wings swivel to cut through the air and provide lifting power on both the upstroke and the downstroke. The wings make a figure 8 pattern in the air, rotating 180 degrees at the shoulder while the rest of the wing stays stiff. On the downstroke, the back of the wing is the top of the airfoil; on the upstroke, the bottom of the wing is on top.</p>
        <p>To fly backward, to back away from a flower, for example, a hummingbird scoops its tail downward and reverses the swivel of its wings.</p>
        <p>Stop-motion photography reveals that some other species can occasionally and briefly fly backward, according to ''The Birds,'' by Roger Tory Peterson and the editors of Life magazine. They include some flycatchers and warblers.</p>
