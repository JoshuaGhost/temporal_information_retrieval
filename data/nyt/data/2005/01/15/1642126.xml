        <p>On days like these, when Jets receiver Santana Moss feels the frozen turf beneath his cleats and the wind slapping his face, when it seems as if the coaches are calling a running play on every down and trying to win an entire game 4 yards at a time, he can break a sweat when he thinks back to the old metal shop with no air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>Just north of the athletic department on the campus of Carol City High School in Florida, is a cluster of classrooms where students learn trades they can apply later in life. The metal shop is there, along with the woodshop, the auto-body shop and the printing press, but the only metalwork going on involves pumping iron.</p>
        <p>On a summer day, 70 high school students and one National Football League wide receiver cram into the metal shop to weld their bodies and their futures. About 10 years ago, the shop was converted into a weight room, but no one bothered to install air-conditioning. When the temperature in South Florida reaches 90 degrees and the heat index climbs well over 100, the coaches at Carol City like to say that their weight room is the steamiest spot in the world.</p>
        <p>''When they all start lifting and start working, you feel that sweat and that humidity in there,'' Walt Frazier, Carol City's football coach for the past 21 seasons, said of his team's heavy-metal facility during a telephone interview this week. ''I'm telling you, the heat is on.''</p>
        <p>The weight room has become the hot spot for generations of Carol City football players, who go on to the University of Miami or the University of Florida, then return every summer for impromptu high school reunions. For many recent graduates, Carol City was where they shared good times and big victories. For Moss, it was a true vocational school, where he learned the patience that would be required of a receiver in the Jets' run-oriented offense.</p>
        <p>There were no frozen fields or cold winds in Carol City, but the coaches did call running plays on almost every down and did try to win state championships 4 yards at a time. Moss recalled how he would often have one pass a game thrown in his direction. If he caught it, he would generally outrun everyone for a touchdown. If he did not, he would have to wait until the next week.</p>
        <p>''I'd get my one attempt per game, and if I didn't make the most of it, oh well,'' Moss said this week at the Jets' training facility in Hempstead, N.Y. ''High school humbled me to be who I am right now. I learned that I would have to wait my turn. I think about high school a lot, because I'm in the same situation here.''</p>
        <p>As Moss spoke, he was standing outside the Jets' weight room, a long way from the metal shop in Carol City, but not as far as some would believe. Moss is sometimes awestruck by the similarities between the Jets' attack and his high school offense; each relies heavily on the run and sprinkles in some well-timed play-action passes.</p>
        <p>''I think Santana is especially comfortable with the fact that he's not getting the ball every play, because that's what he got used to in high school,'' Frazier said. ''We would run a high percentage of the time and use Santana mainly for that one play a game. He didn't have a lot of catches, but he had the big ones.''</p>
        <p>The Jets' offensive coordinator, Paul Hackett, might have taken a page from Frazier's playbook last Saturday night, softening the San Diego Chargers with short passes and runs between the tackles. With the rain falling steadily in San Diego, and the Chargers' defense stuck in the mud, Moss suddenly sprinted past the secondary and grabbed a 47-yard touchdown pass that was the Jets' longest play of the game.</p>
        <p>He had 100 yards receiving on 4 catches in that game. During the regular season, he caught 45 passes for 838 yards, with 5 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Much attention was cast this week on another Moss; Minnesota's Randy Moss was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct because of a post-touchdown celebration Sunday in Green Bay that many people found vulgar. But Jets Coach Herman Edwards went out of his way to refer to Santana when he spoke Tuesday about needing more significant gains when the Jets face the Steelers on Saturday in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Named after the musician Carlos Santana, Moss says he prefers the fastest tempo he can find. He was a track star at the University of Miami, has run the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds and sped his way to the first round of the 2001 draft. When Edwards, a former N.F.L. defensive back, was asked how he would have covered Moss, he said, ''I probably couldn't.''</p>
        <p>On a team with few big playmakers or personalities, Moss is a 5-foot-10 burst of energy. During mundane practices, he play-fights with other receivers. And on game days, he is athletic enough to turn the Jets' unglamorous attack into a thing of beauty.</p>
        <p>Because the Jets and the Steelers tend to be conservative, content to run the ball, rely on their defense and limit any risk of a turnover, their divisional playoff at Heinz Field could be decided by one or two breakthrough plays.</p>
        <p>Moss may be the most logical candidate to run the Jets out of the muck in Pittsburgh and into the American Football Conference championship game.</p>
        <p>''Just like high school, I'll probably get that one opportunity,'' Moss said. ''And I'm going to have to take advantage of it.''</p>
