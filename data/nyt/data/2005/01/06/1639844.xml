        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki took some pages from the national Republican playbook in his 11th annual State of the State address to the Legislature on Wednesday, speaking of the need to simplify the state's tax code, to keep cutting taxes and to remain vigilant against the threats of crime and international terrorism.</p>
        <p>In a 69-minute speech received with sparse applause, Mr. Pataki, a three-term Republican governor, seemed to place himself in line with the Bush White House on a number of policies. And while he praised his own accomplishments in the past, he made it clear that he was mindful of how his record would look in the future.</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki took some pages from the national Republican playbook in his 11th annual State of the State address to the Legislature on Wednesday, speaking of the need to simplify the state's tax code, to keep cutting taxes and to remain vigilant against the threats of crime and international terrorism.</p>
        <p>In a 69-minute speech received with sparse applause, Mr. Pataki, a three-term Republican governor, seemed to place himself in line with the Bush White House on a number of policies. And while he praised his own accomplishments in the past, he made it clear that he was mindful of how his record would look in the future.</p>
        <p>''Over the past decade, we have improved New Yorkers' lives time and time again by embracing bold reforms and sweeping change,'' said Mr. Pataki, adding repeatedly that he had more left to do.</p>
        <p>The speech left both Mr. Pataki's political allies and adversaries wanting more. Many who heard it said it was more notable for what was omitted than what was said.</p>
        <p>For instance, in speaking of taxes, Mr. Pataki called for state officials to make New York's tax code ''fairer, simpler and friendlier for everyone,'' but he provided no details or guidance for how it should be done.</p>
        <p>He did announce that he had asked a former member of the Bush-Cheney transition team and television economic commentator, Lawrence Kudlow, to lead the effort. As he spoke, Mr. Kudlow was standing in a pinstriped suit in the balcony above him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also invoked the need for some tax cuts, calling for a speedier end to a temporary income tax surcharge on taxpayers with high incomes. He did not place a dollar figure on the amount of revenue that would be lost to such cuts. He did not even mention the state's projected $6 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year that begins April 1, or the $7.7 billion gap for the following year.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, in his first such address, he made a point of calling the then $5 billion deficit a crisis,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a fiscal analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group. ''This gap is just about as bad as that one; this year he did not mention the budget problem, though the speech was two-thirds longer this time.''</p>
        <p>Only toward the end of his speech did Mr. Pataki acknowledge, tacitly, that New York's government was broken, with its chronic legislative gridlock and other problems.</p>
        <p>On that topic, he proposed seven changes, including two that he has worked to torpedo before: reforming the budget process and tackling the question of lobbying for state contracts. Another change, banning political gifts from lobbyists, was endorsed two months ago by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, before he announced that he would be a candidate for governor in 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said the changes he was offering would ''shatter the status quo, strengthen public confidence and change Albany for generations to come.''</p>
        <p>The fact that Mr. Pataki spoke of such governmental overhauls for the first time in such a forum, and for so long, was encouraging to many in the audience.</p>
        <p>''It's clear the governor heard the public outcry that Albany has to be fixed,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director with the New York Public Interest Research Group, who has watched each of Mr. Pataki's annual addresses since he took office in 1995. ''The question is, is he serious about changing the way Albany operates?''</p>
        <p>Among the critics, some said Mr. Pataki was part of the problem, and they pointed out that when he came into office, in 1995, he vowed reforms that never materialized.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most notable moment came when he called for timely budgets, since the last 20 have missed the April 1 deadline. There was a cheer, and many in the chamber stood and clapped. More than a few senators in the front row, seeing that Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, was slow in rising, yelled for him to stand, and eventually he did, turning toward Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Mr. Silver said the speech was a rehash of old ideas.</p>
        <p>He said it did not raise many of the major issues facing the state -- a court order to pump millions of dollars into New York City schools, a federal requirement to overhaul the state's election system, multibillion-dollar transportation needs -- never mind what plans are needed to face them. ''It sounded like the governor is running, but I'm not sure for what,'' Mr. Silver said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno said the governor had ''delivered a bold, positive and hopeful message for the people of New York State.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver was studiously noncommittal on the governor's call for a ban on gifts from lobbyists, but Mr. Bruno welcomed all Mr. Pataki's calls for reforms.</p>
        <p>Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi praised the governor for proposing more changes of the state's public authorities, which have been criticized recently for the large amount of debt they create and the secrecy they operate under. One of Mr. Pataki's proposals calls for eliminating some of the state's roughly 700 authorities and boards and combining others.</p>
        <p>Specifically, on reform, the governor called for a ban on hiring lobbyists to influence government contracts, which is now allowed and not regulated, and a ban on all gifts from lobbyists, who now face a $75 limit when giving to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>He outlined a plan to track down the state's 100 most dangerous felons by posting their mug shots on a public Internet site. He said he would submit legislation to fight agricultural and cyber terrorism, vowing to strengthen the state's security strategy.</p>
        <p>He sprinkled the speech with tidbits for many constituencies. He announced more technology jobs moving to the Hudson Valley, 20 new bird conservation areas, an upstate revitalization plan, and restoration of the Nepperhan River in Yonkers. He also called for a special checkoff on state income tax forms to make it easier for people to make donations to build a memorial at the World Trade Center site.</p>
        <p>In the end, the governor invoked the patriotic spirit in New York since Sept. 11, saying that optimism was on the rise with the rebuilding in Lower Manhattan.</p>
