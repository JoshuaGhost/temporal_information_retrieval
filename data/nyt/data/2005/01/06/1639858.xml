        <p>Letter from Benjamin B Ferencz, who was a prosecutor at Nuremberg war crimes trials, says Eric A Posner's denunciation of both International Court of Justice and recently established International Criminal Court in The Hague (Dec 30 Op-Ed) repudiates highest ideals espoused by United States during Nuremberg war crimes trials; says Posner does not note that every nation has right to try its own citizens</p>

        <p>Eric A. Posner's denunciation of both the International Court of Justice and the recently established International Criminal Court in The Hague (''All Justice, Too, Is Local,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 30) repudiates the highest ideals espoused by the United States during the Nuremberg war crimes trials. I take issue with his depiction of the records, purposes and powers of these tribunals. He does not note that every nation has the right to try its own citizens.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Eric A. Posner's denunciation of both the International Court of Justice and the recently established International Criminal Court in The Hague (''All Justice, Too, Is Local,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 30) repudiates the highest ideals espoused by the United States during the Nuremberg war crimes trials. I take issue with his depiction of the records, purposes and powers of these tribunals. He does not note that every nation has the right to try its own citizens.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor is subject to strict controls, including close supervision by Britain, Canada and a host of other nations that are being alienated by bellicose intimidation and demands for immunity for all Americans. Mr. Posner expresses fear of politicization, yet favors Security Council control of the court.</p>
        <p>Only lawbreakers need fear the rule of law. Mr. Posner warns international organizations to ''adapt to great power politics'' or ''wither on the vine.'' We may all ''wither'' if we continue the power politics that inevitably leads to war rather than law.</p>
        <p>Benjamin B. Ferencz  Delray Beach, Fla., Dec. 30, 2004</p>
        <p>The writer was a prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials.</p>
