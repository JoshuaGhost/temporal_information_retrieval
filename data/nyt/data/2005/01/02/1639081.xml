        <p>The tidal waves that slammed Indian Ocean shorelines a week ago struck during the height of the tourist season, killing hundreds of foreigners on vacation from dozens of countries. At least 15 Americans are reported dead, with many more missing, and that number will certainly rise as the authorities gain a clearer picture of the devastation.</p>
        <p>But as surviving American travelers to the region worked their way home in recent days, their stories offered a vivid picture of the destruction.</p>
        <p>Three Americans sailing a boat just off a Thai beach could not escape the 30-foot tsunami, they said, so they survived by sailing directly into it.</p>
        <p>Julie Sobolewski, 47, her son Casey Sobolewski, 25, and their friend John Hanke, 42, all experienced sailors from Oceanside, Calif., chartered a 35-foot sailboat to sailing off Rai Leh Beach in the Krabi region.</p>
        <p>On a ''gorgeous, sunny, hot day,'' she said, they were half a mile offshore and headed toward a sandbar and beach where some 150 people were sunbathing. Suddenly a 30-foot wall of water appeared and washed over the island.</p>
        <p>''It looked like the top half of the island was falling into the ocean,'' she said. It swallowed up the people. ''They disappeared,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The beautiful blue waters suddenly turned turbulent, and the tsunami then shattered a half dozen wooden longboats nearby.</p>
        <p>''When it hit the five boats, they just exploded, and all of a sudden there were 35 people floating in the waters,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then it bore down on them. ''We realized we couldn't outrun it and sailed into it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The wave had been weakened by the sandbar, and the boat knifed through it. After that, they spent six hours rescuing people in the water, she said.</p>
        <p>''We had no idea it was a tsunami,'' she said. ''We were just doing what we had to do. We just knew what we had seen.''</p>
        <p>In the same area, Christianna Savino, 20, and her friend, Jake Duhart, 21, who teach English in Bangkok, were rock climbing above a beach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duhart was 40 feet up the rocky waterfront bluff when he heard climbers above him yelling about a giant wave.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing panic, with a huge wall of white water roaring toward them, they struggled to free themselves from their safety lines and joined the hundreds of beachgoers clambering for higher ground.</p>
        <p>The waves left ''screaming people with bloody and gashed-up limbs and faces'' in its wake, Ms. Savino wrote in an e-mail message to relatives and friends.</p>
        <p>Helicopters and ambulances rushed injured people to a hospital, and relatives and friends of victims crowded to the beach as rescue boats dropped off bodies wrapped in blue tarps.</p>
        <p>''People would have hopes in their eyes until the tarps were unwrapped and the faces were shown, and then they would cover their mouths and cry,'' wrote Ms. Savino, who is from Boulder, Colo. ''Most were hoping the bodies weren't the ones they were looking for, while some were just hoping to find closure on their missing friends and relatives.''</p>
        <p>One Californian couple escaped death by actually scuba diving under the tsunami. Faye Linda Wachs and Eugene J. Kim, from Santa Monica, Calif., were diving 120 feet underwater off Ko Phi Phi Island in Thailand when the tsunami hit. All they knew was that there was a sudden heavy current and loss of visibility in the water.</p>
        <p>Soon, they quit and headed toward shore. They began seeing dead bodies in the water, both Thai and tourists, with their clothing ripped off. Fishermen were dragging bodies toward shore.</p>
        <p>On the beach, cats and dogs and children's toys were everywhere, and people were running around screaming, said Ms. Wachs, 35, a sociology professor. One palm tree had a speedboat impaled on it upside down; another had a dead baby in its branches. The piles of dead bodies were separated: Thais and tourists.</p>
        <p>''There were lots of broken legs and deep gash wounds like you'd expect to see in the Civil War,'' Ms. Wachs said. Of the lucky ones washed cleanly out to sea, some swam back.</p>
        <p>Their cabana was leveled, and their possessions all gone, but they had their bathing suits, flip-flops and their wallets.</p>
        <p>''We began seeing we had just freakishly survived a natural catastrophe,'' said Mr. Kim, 34, a transportation consultant.</p>
        <p>Some able-bodied men survived by scurrying up palm trees, but some were still washed out with the trees.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wachs's and Mr. Kim's hotel became a makeshift hospital run by a Thai doctor who had people strip sheets off hotel beds to use for tourniquets. People screamed for morphine. Makeshift bamboo bridges were placed over sink holes, and people split into crews using doors and box springs to carry the injured to helicopters.</p>
        <p>''We asked a man we were carrying if there was anyone looking for him, and he said, 'No, my girlfriend dead, I saw her die.' So we told him, 'Well, your family really wants to see you alive.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim recalled, ''Within the total chaos, there was a sense of order, of every man and woman dividing into search and rescue teams and leaders sending them out.''</p>
        <p>''It was a weird, horrible nightmarish 'Survivor' situation,'' he said.</p>
