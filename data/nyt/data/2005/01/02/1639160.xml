        <p>Anthony Arnove letter scores Jonathan Tepperman for 'ignorance' shown in Dec 12 essay citing book An Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire by Arundhati Roy; Tepperman response appended</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jonathan Tepperman ought to read what Arundhati Roy has actually written on the subject of ''anti-Americanism'' before committing his ignorance to print (''The Anti-Anti-Americans,'' Dec. 12).</p>
        <p>But then it's much easier to dismiss her essays as ''peevish'' and ''strident'' than to engage in debate. In reality, Roy is a left-wing critic of American foreign policy and an ''anti-anti-American.''</p>
        <p>In the very book Tepperman cites, ''An Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire,'' Roy writes, ''I, who have been vilified for being 'anti-American' and 'anti-West,' find myself in the extraordinary position of defending the people of America.'' She adds, ''American citizens . . . are our allies, our friends.''</p>
        <p>Most who opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq did so not out of some irrational hatred of American culture, but from a commitment to principles our government holds in contempt. And most of them did so, like Arundhati Roy, in solidarity with the many people in this country who share those beliefs.</p>
        <p>Full disclosure: I am a friend and editor of Arundhati Roy and also her North American literary agent. I also worked (until two years ago) for South End Press, the publisher of her book ''An Ordinary Person's Guide to Empire.''</p>
