        <p>POSSIBILITIES raced through David Cook's mind as he eyed a desk intently at Ikea in Hicksville on a recent afternoon. It might work in the recording studio and office he is building in his basement.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Great, I won't have to build it; I can just buy it,''' Mr. Cook later said. But the adjustable-height desk with the drafting table tilt would not support his heavy recording equipment. And he needed a corner desk with a ''wide curved sweep'' to hold the computer, two printers, copier, fax, telephone and enough desktop for two people to work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook left his job as a technician at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton three years ago to work full time on the recording business he had developed over a decade at home, serving local musicians and students who want professional recordings of their work.</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Michele Frimmer, are trying to fit an office into a 10-by-14-foot space next to the studio he is installing in the Huntington three-bedroom home they moved into in June. ''My first issue is to do it without feeling crammed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook is one of a growing number of Long Islanders moving their work into the home. Affordable high-speed Internet access, fax machines, printers and a slew of other communications devices make professional home offices possible, even practical. In addition to people who run small businesses from their homes, many others seem to be creating officelike spaces where they can pay bills on line or finish up work without going to an office far from home.</p>
        <p>A National Association of Realtors survey of home buyers' preferences in 2004 found that 21 percent of buyers thought finding a home with a home office was very important.</p>
        <p>That finding jibes with an estimate by the Farmingdale State Small Business Development Center that 60 to 65 percent of all small businesses on Long Island are operated out of home offices. (A small business is a broad category defined as those with fewer than 500 employees.)</p>
        <p>''Once the Internet came on board,'' said Tom Gallagher, owner of six Century 21 American Homes real estate offices in central Nassau County, ''the home office became a more practical and desirable thing.''</p>
        <p>In terms of real estate, how the home office is integrated into a house can affect resale value, property taxes and income tax write-offs.</p>
        <p>For those who want an office for the whole family to use, all-in-one fold-out desks and shelves that close up to hide the computer are popping up in stores.</p>
        <p>''The trend I'm seeing is, rather than the home office being a separate individual kind of room, people want the home office to become part of the bedroom,'' said Paul Pellicani, principal architect at Paul Joseph Pellicani Architecture and Design in Glen Head. ''Not in the bedroom itself, but off to the side in a sitting area that is also part of the master suite.''</p>
        <p>Not far away from Mr. Cook in Ikea, Marc Scott was looking at computer desks for his bedroom in Southampton. He and his wife already have a computer on the first floor of their home, he said, but want one in the bedroom so they don't have to run downstairs to go online.</p>
        <p>''We use it purely for the Internet,'' Mr. Scott said of the household computer. ''We're looking for something small because nothing here goes with the bedroom furniture.''</p>
        <p>If the whole family will be using the computer, Mr. Pellicani often suggests finding a common space, or opening one up. Most of his clients have ''jumped all over'' that idea, he said.</p>
        <p>''Rather than tuck the home office space into a room, we put it in an open area,'' he said. ''For example, on the second floor, they'll put it in the loft area or open an area'' where parents can do the bills and children can do their homework.</p>
        <p>Picking up on this trend, several model rooms at Ikea have a desk and overhead cabinets neatly sandwiched between matching cabinets lining the side of a kitchen refrigerator and an adjacent dining room.</p>
        <p>Going the less expensive and more distinctive route, there are sometimes excellent values in thrift shops. A two-and-a-half-by-five-foot wooden desk with big drawers on both ends, for example, at Northern Thrift on Route 110 in Huntington was selling for $49.98. Other cabinetry and shelving were priced at less than $30.</p>
        <p>Once the office is set up, people can encounter a pitfall: they're working overtime.</p>
        <p>Cliff Fetner builds three to four large custom homes each year in his building business, Jaco Custom Builders, based in Hauppauge. He also has a home office stocked with all the digital equipment he needs to finish his paperwork at home.</p>
        <p>''Just last night I got up at 4:30 in the morning and couldn't fall back asleep,'' he said. ''So I went to my desk, I did some e-mailing, cleaned up some paperwork and did some filing. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.''</p>
        <p>When Blaze Makoid and his wife, Tracy Mitchell, returned to their home in Bridgehampton from China in November with their adopted baby daughter, Alexandra, they wanted to separate the home office from their new family life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Makoid, an architect, had designed a 700-square-foot barnlike building on the couple's property and connected it to the main house with a 25-foot corridor. They call the hallway ''the connector.''</p>
        <p>''It connects the two pieces, but it's also separating them,'' Mr. Makoid said. ''When you go down there, there's a psychological separation.''</p>
        <p>Now when Mr. Makoid goes to work, he's not distracted by his home life, or the refrigerator. And when the day ends, he leaves his work in the office 25 feet away.</p>
        <p>To take advantage of the open space and sunlight surrounding their property, Mr. Makoid designed garage-type glass doors for the office that roll up on a track and wood-framed screen pocket doors that disappear into the walls. When it's warm, he can lift up the glass doors and slide the screens out of the wall. ''It feels like we're working outside in summer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But building an office addition to the house can change the property tax on a property, Mr. Pellicani, the Glen Head architect, pointed out. Buyers may also not want a separate building customized for an office, affecting the resale value, he said.</p>
        <p>While it's hard to see a downside to Mr. Makoid's light-filled office, most home offices tend to be a smaller, less costly, affair.</p>
        <p>In Huntington, Mr. Cook had to economize on his basement-based business, but he made sure not to compromise on his comfort. He put in new walls that matched the original finish of the basement, including wainscot and chair rail moldings.</p>
        <p>Having passed on the Ikea desk for his studio, he plans to build his own, using industrial railings, table tops and shelving. But even with these spare raw materials, he does not want the studio or the office to look like an industrial space.</p>
        <p>''I want it to be more homey than that,'' Mr. Cook said. ''I'm trying to strike a balance between what's practical and what's comfortable.''</p>
