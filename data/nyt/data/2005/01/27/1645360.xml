      <block class="full_text">
        <p>More than three years after the Sept. 11 attack, jury selection in the case of a Yemeni sheik accused of financing terrorism showed how wrenching it can be for New Yorkers to be asked to sit in judgment of people charged with aiding Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>''I would hope I would be able to reach an impartial verdict,'' said one woman interviewed by the judge in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. ''However, the event was so horrific that I don't know, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>For both sides, jury selection, which took more than two weeks and was completed yesterday, was a journey through a minefield of New Yorkers' attitudes that could shape a verdict in a case that has drawn international attention. Opening statements are scheduled for this morning.</p>
        <p>A pool of 270 potential jurors filled out questionnaires on Jan. 10 that asked if they could render an impartial verdict ''notwithstanding the events of Sept. 11.'' According to a defense analysis, 90 of the 270 people, one-third, said they would not be able to judge the case fairly.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, their apprehensions were close to the surface. One woman remembered being in Lower Manhattan on the day of the attack and wondering if she would ever see her children again.</p>
        <p>Before the judge, Sterling Johnson Jr., had asked whether she could be fair, she teared up. ''I still have a lot of leftover feeling about it, as you can see,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The sheik, Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad, 56, and his aide, Mohammed Mohsen Yahya Zayed, 31, are charged with conspiracy and with providing financial support for Al Qaeda and Hamas.</p>
        <p>The jury selected yesterday included a former Navy medic whose brother is a police officer and a medical worker who said she was often suspicious of the views of Attorney General John Ashcroft.</p>
        <p>After some sparring among the lawyers over prosecution claims that the defense was using its challenges to try unfairly to exclude white men, the final jury panel of 12 included 5 blacks, 6 whites and an Asian man. Seven are men; five are women.</p>
        <p>Because of security concerns, the jurors are to be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal marshals. Their names and addresses have been kept secret.</p>
        <p>William H. Goodman, one of Sheik Moayad's lawyers, said outside court that he believed the jury could be fair. But, he added, the selection process had highlighted concerns about fairness because of what he called the background of fear that affects so many New Yorkers. The jury was drawn from residents of Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island.</p>
        <p>As much as he was concerned about what people said during jury selection, Mr. Goodman said he was also concerned about what they might not have said. He said he worried ''about people's unconscious biases that never get fully aired'' in a proceeding like the one against the sheik and Mr. Zayed.</p>
        <p>On occasion in recent days in federal court in Brooklyn, some people were quite frank about their view that the sheik and Mr. Zayed would probably be proved guilty.</p>
        <p>One man with a light gray mustache who said his daughter's soccer coach was killed at the World Trade Center in the 2001 attack, was asked by the judge if he had any preconceptions about what the verdict should be. ''To be honest,'' he said, ''my first opinion was leaning toward being guilty, maybe by association.''</p>
        <p>In a pattern repeated many times, Judge Johnson then asked if the man could put aside any such views in the service of fairness. The man with the mustache said he thought he could be fair. He made the first cut, when jurors can be dismissed ''for cause,'' like obvious bias.</p>
        <p>He was asked to return yesterday for the final selection, when lawyers exercised challenges for which they were not required to give any reason. Yesterday, the man with the mustache was excused after sitting for a time in the second seat in the jury box.</p>
        <p>Some people were insistent in recent days that it would be hard for them to overcome their suspicions of the defendants. One man said Muslims use their mosques to hide weapons. Another said the news media had made it clear that Muslim charities were a conduit for financing terrorism.</p>
        <p>''They're willing to die for their cause,'' said a woman identified only by her juror number, 141.</p>
        <p>Another potential juror said, ''It seems like there's going to be a lot of evidence that would show their guilt.''</p>
        <p>Of the 270 potential jurors, 247 answered a question that asked if there was ''anything about the nature of this case that causes you to believe you should not serve as a juror.'' According to the defense, 28 percent of them answered ''yes.''</p>
