        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Finally, a discussion of decreased social mobility that looks beyond schooling. As David Brooks notes: ''We can spend all we want on schools. But if families are disrupted, if the social environment is dysfunctional, bigger budgets won't help.''</p>
        <p>Advantaged children succeed not merely because their schools are better but because their medical care, preschool, after-school and summer experiences are better -- and because their home lives are structured for success.</p>
        <p>Yet our current economic and social policies make life precarious in just those ways -- for those who are poor and (increasingly) for those who are middle class. What should we do about this, Mr. Brooks?</p>
