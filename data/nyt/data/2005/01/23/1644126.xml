        <p>Advertisements for movie Dirty Rotten Scoundrels are part of unusual campaign seen by some as pitch to sway Tony award voters; photo (M)</p>

        <p>It's in the nature of advertising to stretch the truth. But perhaps in the spirit of a show about two con men prowling the French Riviera, the advertisements for the Broadway musical ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' which opens Jan. 31, take the idea of artful salesmanship to heart, making it hard to tell what's being advertised. A radio commercial began with the show's star, John Lithgow, earnestly pitching a ''serious cause, something so important to us all,'' before revealing the cause: selling tickets. The producers later pulled the spot because of the tsunami.</p>
        <p>The print advertisements are more traditional but no less deceptive. One screams, ''An event that will be all over Page 6!'' and then in smaller letters notes, ''of our Playbill.'' That provoked the keepers of The New York Post's gossip franchise to assure their readers that the musical had not, in fact, been all over Page 6. A future advertisement will shout, ''The hottest leading man on Broadway!'' followed by, ''sends his regards from Australia'' -- a reference to Hugh Jackman, who is not otherwise connected to ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''</p>

        <p>It's in the nature of advertising to stretch the truth. But perhaps in the spirit of a show about two con men prowling the French Riviera, the advertisements for the Broadway musical ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' which opens Jan. 31, take the idea of artful salesmanship to heart, making it hard to tell what's being advertised. A radio commercial began with the show's star, John Lithgow, earnestly pitching a ''serious cause, something so important to us all,'' before revealing the cause: selling tickets. The producers later pulled the spot because of the tsunami.</p>
        <p>The print advertisements are more traditional but no less deceptive. One screams, ''An event that will be all over Page 6!'' and then in smaller letters notes, ''of our Playbill.'' That provoked the keepers of The New York Post's gossip franchise to assure their readers that the musical had not, in fact, been all over Page 6. A future advertisement will shout, ''The hottest leading man on Broadway!'' followed by, ''sends his regards from Australia'' -- a reference to Hugh Jackman, who is not otherwise connected to ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''</p>
        <p>David Yazbek, the show's songwriter, worked with the advertising company SpotCo on part of the campaign, including the ''serious cause'' radio spot. Mr. Yazbek, who wrote jingles for companies like Miller Brewing and Mars in the 1980's, had been frustrated by the promotion of his Broadway musical ''The Full Monty,'' which ran for two years but was overshadowed by ''The Producers.'' ''I felt like the marketing misrepresented what the show was,'' he said, that it veered toward sex or sentimentality, rather than pitching it simply as a comedy.</p>
        <p>The ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' advertisements, which have helped sell $5.25 million in advance tickets so far, recall the unusual Tony Award campaign SpotCo conducted for ''Avenue Q'' encouraging voters to ''vote your heart.'' (The advertisements also resemble the current ad-within-an-ad campaign for the Monty Python musical ''Spamalot,'' though it is more tongue-in-cheek than sleight of hand.) Will ''Scoundrels'' try to sway Tony voters? Marty Bell, one of the producers, said, ''Our campaign will probably be, 'Don't vote what you believe in, vote your wallet.'''</p>
