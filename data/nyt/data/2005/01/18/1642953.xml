        <p>Whether maliciously or inadvertently, the company's main domain name, panix.com, was somehow transferred to a company in Australia. The incident served as a reminder that domain names are as vulnerable to theft as any other digital commodity. [Page C6.]</p>

        <p>Nissan Chief May Run Renault, Too  Carlos Ghosn, left, who turned around the fortunes of Nissan Motor, is expected to be named chief executive of Renault. He would be the first person in the auto industry to take on such dual roles. Mr. Ghosn's success at Nissan led it to leapfrog Honda to the No.2 spot in Japan in six years. The question is whether he can improve on that performance at Renault. [C12.]</p>

        <p>European and Asian Stocks Rise  Stocks in European and Asian markets posted gains, while United States markets were closed. They will reopen today. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Corporate Retreat, Moat Optional  Europe's castles, palaces and manor houses are welcoming American companies and associations that rent them for meetings, gala dinners and other functions. [C14.]</p>
