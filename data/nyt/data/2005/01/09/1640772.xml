        <p>The Nets were tired, short-handed, ill and trailing by 17 points with six minutes to play Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Their previous two road games were blowout losses against Washington and Milwaukee, but this time, the Nets put up a fight. Behind a career-high 20 points from center Jason Collins and the 60th triple-double of Jason Kidd's career, the Nets cut the deficit to 2 on a 3-pointer by Kidd with 10.2 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>But Magic guard Cuttino Mobley, who made six consecutive free throws in the final 25.9 seconds, sank two with 9.7 seconds remaining to put the game away. The Magic, led by Grant Hill's 22 points, held on for a 104-101 victory, despite allowing the Nets to score 40 fourth-quarter points, their season high for a quarter this season.</p>
        <p>Kidd, who scored 15 points in the quarter, finished with 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for his first triple-double this season. He moved past Larry Bird for fourth on the league's career list; only Oscar Robertson (181), Magic Johnson (138) and Wilt Chamberlain (78) have had more, according to the Nets.</p>
        <p>The Nets trailed by as many as 19 points and lost for the 13th time in 18 road games. They squandered an opportunity to pull three games behind the first-place Knicks in the Atlantic Division. At 12-21, they trail the Knicks by four games.</p>
        <p>''We have to win some games on the road or this could get out of hand in a hurry,'' said Kidd, who likened the Nets' early-season struggles to a small brush fire, one that could become a wildfire. ''If we don't stop it now, it could get ugly.''</p>
        <p>The Nets have their big three in Kidd, Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson. What they are still lacking is size and depth.</p>
        <p>Unless the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, can bolster the team's roster before next month's trading deadline, the Nets may be hard pressed to make the playoffs after winning three consecutive Atlantic Division titles.</p>
        <p>''Right now, teams just aren't willing to do anything,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>The Nets had only nine players available against the Magic. The reserve forward Brian Scalabrine, who missed his eighth consecutive game with a hamstring injury, did not make the trip. The reserve forward Jabari Smith did not dress because of flulike symptoms.</p>
        <p>The Nets' leading scorer, Jefferson, and the backup point guard Travis Best were also experiencing flulike symptoms, but they played. Jefferson shot 6 of 9 and finished with 17 points, but he was just 2 for 13 from the floor until the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''I was just playing the percentages,'' said Jefferson, whose 3-pointer with 26.9 seconds left cut the Nets' deficit to 97-94. ''I had to hit one sooner or later. The last couple of games, I've been a little beat up, a little sick. My shot just wasn't there tonight.''</p>
        <p>After an 82-72 victory over Golden State on Friday, Kidd, the Nets' captain, said the result would mean nothing if the Nets could not follow it up with another strong defensive performance in Orlando.</p>
        <p>But the Nets had an inauspicious start, ceding a 28-17 lead to the Magic after the first quarter. Orlando also pulled away in the second half. After three quarters, the Magic had five players in double-figure scoring, and Dwight Howard, the No. 1 pick in the last draft, finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Responding to the Vince Carter interview on TNT last week (Carter said he might not have pushed himself as hard as he should have in Toronto), the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, said: ''Probably 60 percent of the players in the league could say, 'If I work a little bit harder, I could be a better player.'''</p>
        <p>Thorn said he was not worried about Carter's attitude when he was thinking about acquiring him. ''My concern was his health when we got him,'' he said. ''And we gave him a very thorough physical because he had some swelling in his heel.'' Coach Lawrence Frank said of Carter, ''All I can tell you is since he's been here, he's given nothing but his best effort.''</p>
