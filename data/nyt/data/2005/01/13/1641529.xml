        <p>Those on the receiving end of holiday gifts are looking sharp this year. Shoppers flocked online during the holiday season, buying nearly $16 billion worth of goods in November and December, according to the Internet consulting firm ComScore Networks.</p>
        <p>While that is up 29 percent from 2003, consumers' buying patterns were little altered from other times of the year.</p>
        <p>Computer hardware led all holiday purchases, at $3.9 billion, while clothing and electronic gadgets rounded out the top three. Apparel sales, though, jumped higher than other goods, thanks in part to companies like Sears, Wal-Mart and others rolling out clothing categories online.</p>
        <p>According to Shopping.com, of the top 10 selling items, two were game consoles (Xbox and PlayStation), one was an MP3 player (iPod, of course) and seven were digital cameras -- quickly filled, no doubt, with photos of recipients modeling their new clothes.</p>
