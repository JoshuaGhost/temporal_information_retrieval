        <p>The New York City Department of Transportation has determined that a $1 million donation that was intended for a ferry is not enough, so it is going shopping for a less-expensive vessel.</p>
        <p>Having seen how helpful ferries were in evacuating Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, officials of the Nasdaq stock market gave the Transportation Department $1 million to buy itself one in 2002. But the price of ferries has been rising faster than tech stocks, so $1 million was not enough to buy even a small used model, said Tom Cocola, a department spokesman.</p>

        <p>The New York City Department of Transportation has determined that a $1 million donation that was intended for a ferry is not enough, so it is going shopping for a less-expensive vessel.</p>
        <p>Having seen how helpful ferries were in evacuating Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, officials of the Nasdaq stock market gave the Transportation Department $1 million to buy itself one in 2002. But the price of ferries has been rising faster than tech stocks, so $1 million was not enough to buy even a small used model, said Tom Cocola, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>Now, the department has changed course and is in the market for a fast utility boat that would be useful in emergencies aboard the Staten Island ferries and private ferries that ply the city's harbor. That type of boat would not be able to evacuate more than a few people, but could bring supplies or rescue workers to a ferry in distress, Mr. Cocola said.</p>
        <p>''Both Nasdaq and the city believe that a high-speed utility boat will enhance the city's capability to respond to crises and emergencies which could affect the movement of commuters and tourists on the city's municipal and private ferries,'' Mr. Cocola said.</p>
        <p>From the donor's perspective, a utility boat is better than no boat at all.</p>
        <p>Bethany Sherman, a spokeswoman for the Nasdaq, said executives there wanted to help enhance the city's ability to respond to crises like the Sept. 11 attacks. They created the Nasdaq Disaster Relief Fund, and the Nasdaq, its employees and companies whose shares trade on its market contributed $3 million, she said. Of that amount, $1 million was designated for a ferry.</p>
        <p>But ferry operators confirmed what city officials soon discovered: ferries do not come so cheap.</p>
        <p>''A million dollars? Well, that won't buy you much,'' said Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi, which operates small ferries around New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said the boats his company uses to carry commuters between Jersey City, Manhattan and Brooklyn cost $1.2 million when they were new. The two boats his company is having built now will cost more than $2 million each, he said. With $1 million, the city's best option probably would have been to buy a fishing boat that could be used as a ferry in an emergency, Mr. Fox said.</p>
        <p>Despite their disappointment, Nasdaq officials endorsed the city's Plan B, and they hope to see their market's blue logo on one or two utility boats soon, Ms. Sherman said. The Nasdaq is an electronic stock market that is unlike the New York Stock Exchange in that it does not have a central trading floor. Its main office is in the One Liberty Plaza building, just a block from the World Trade Center site across Church Street.</p>
        <p>''We're residents of downtown, that's where our corporate headquarters are and we want to support the Wall Street area,'' Ms. Sherman said.</p>
