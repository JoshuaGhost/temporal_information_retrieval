        <p>Amnesty International reports that unlawful killings by both government and Maoist rebel forces are on rise in Nepal; more than 10,000 people have been killed during nine-year-old conflict (S)</p>

        <p>Unlawful killings by government forces and Maoist rebels are rising, with both sides failing to hold the responsible parties accountable, Amnesty International said. The killings are occurring in ''the context of a severe human rights crisis and a breakdown in the rule of law,'' the group said. It said that while the patterns of killings -- which include extrajudicial executions by the security forces and attacks on civilians by the Maoists -- have been well established, the number of such killings increased significantly in 2004, as did the sophistication with which they were covered up. The nine-year-old conflict has killed more than 10,000 people.</p>
