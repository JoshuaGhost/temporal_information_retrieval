      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial opposes legislation proposed by supporters of Pres Jacques Chirac to make him and other former presidents senators for life, in attempt to shield him from corruption investigation; says purpose of parliamentary immunity is not to put elected officials above the law; says many French voters would like him to have an honorable retirement, and there is good chance that his successor would quietly try to drop investigation against him; says lifetime Senate seat would be big mistake</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Supporters of President Jacques Chirac have introduced legislation that would make former presidents senators for life, which may sound like a nice solution to the universal problem of what to do with a former head of state. But this bad idea is really an attempt to shield Mr. Chirac from the corruption investigations that have swirled around him but never actually touched him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, whose term ends in 2007, has distanced himself from the proposal, and in any case, it is a very long shot, since it would require a change in the French Constitution. But there is no question that the prospect of investigations and possible prosecutions is much on the mind of the 72-year-old president as he nears the end of a very long political career. The main focus of the investigations is corruption in the Paris region during Mr. Chirac's 18 years as mayor. Alain Juppé, a former prime minister who had been regarded as Mr. Chirac's designated heir, was given a suspended sentence and banned from politics for a year after he was convicted last year of misusing public funds in the Paris City Hall.</p>

        <p>Supporters of President Jacques Chirac have introduced legislation that would make former presidents senators for life, which may sound like a nice solution to the universal problem of what to do with a former head of state. But this bad idea is really an attempt to shield Mr. Chirac from the corruption investigations that have swirled around him but never actually touched him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac, whose term ends in 2007, has distanced himself from the proposal, and in any case, it is a very long shot, since it would require a change in the French Constitution. But there is no question that the prospect of investigations and possible prosecutions is much on the mind of the 72-year-old president as he nears the end of a very long political career. The main focus of the investigations is corruption in the Paris region during Mr. Chirac's 18 years as mayor. Alain Juppé, a former prime minister who had been regarded as Mr. Chirac's designated heir, was given a suspended sentence and banned from politics for a year after he was convicted last year of misusing public funds in the Paris City Hall.</p>
        <p>There is talk that Mr. Chirac might run again, but if he does not, many French voters probably would like him to have an honorable retirement. He has, after all, been a fixture of French politics as far as anyone can remember. He got his first senior government post under Charles de Gaulle, was a minister under Georges Pompidou, prime minister under Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995. There is a good chance that whoever succeeds him will quietly try to drop the investigations against Mr. Chirac.</p>
        <p>That's a moral dilemma the French leadership will have to resolve. But evading responsibility by giving Mr. Chirac a lifetime Senate seat would be a big mistake. The purpose of parliamentary immunity is to protect elected officials from politically motivated prosecution while they serve, not to put them above the law. Mr. Chirac's friends in the Senate would do their country a favor by dropping this foolish and offensive idea.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 27, 2005, Thursday  An editorial on Jan. 4 incorrectly described the American role in helping victims of the earthquake in Bam, Iran. The United States delivered on its pledge within days. It was not among the countries that failed to meet their commitments. An editorial on Jan. 21 about a proposal to make Jacques Chirac a senator after he finishes his term as French president incorrectly said that legislation doing so had been introduced. The bill's author said he had decided to do further work after it came under public criticism.</p>
