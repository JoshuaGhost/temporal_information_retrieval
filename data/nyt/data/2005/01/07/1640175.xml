        <p>Biophan Technologies, which is developing coatings for catheters and medical implants like stents and pacemakers that make it feasible to view them with M.R.I. machines, will announce today an agreement to acquire aMRIs, a German start-up that has been working on an alternative approach to the same problem. The German company wraps microwires around the device to be scanned. Michael L. Weiner, chief executive of Biophan, said that unlike Biophan, aMRIs had already successfully tested its approach in animals and that the deal, valued at about $4 million, would substantially improve Biophan's research resources. Biophan is based in Rochester.</p>
