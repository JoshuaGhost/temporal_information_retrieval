        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he expected homeowners would get another $400 property tax rebate this year, an election-year gift he hopes to give even though the city needs to find billions of dollars to close looming budget deficits.</p>
        <p>In the strongest signal yet that he intends to renew the popular tax break, Mr. Bloomberg, responding to a question from a reporter, said that the $250 million cost of the rebate ''is a very small amount of our total revenues,'' and that he foresaw being able to offer it again.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he expected homeowners would get another $400 property tax rebate this year, an election-year gift he hopes to give even though the city needs to find billions of dollars to close looming budget deficits.</p>
        <p>In the strongest signal yet that he intends to renew the popular tax break, Mr. Bloomberg, responding to a question from a reporter, said that the $250 million cost of the rebate ''is a very small amount of our total revenues,'' and that he foresaw being able to offer it again.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we think we would be able to do the same thing,'' he said, adding that ''it is an option, and if this city were in real trouble, of course you wouldn't.''</p>
        <p>''But I do think that you will be able to because I think we are going in the right direction,'' he continued.</p>
        <p>By yesterday, the city's Department of Finance had mailed out last year's rebate checks to 98 percent of the city's 655,000 eligible homeowners. Of the 15,000 homeowners who have not gotten them yet, a good number include those who live in bungalow communities (like Breezy Point in Queens) and in large cooperatives with multiple addresses (like Zeckendorf Towers on Union Square).</p>
        <p>But those homeowners should get checks within a few weeks, in envelopes marked with the name of the man who is eager to claim credit for the rebate: Mr. Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>Securing legislative approval to offer the rebate last year was a significant political victory for the mayor, who dismissed criticism by fiscal monitors that the rebate was fiscally irresponsible at a time when the city faced rising costs and large deficits. The mayor has said he believes the money is an appropriate way of honoring the sacrifices homeowners have made since he raised property taxes by 18.5 percent in 2002.</p>
        <p>The legislation allowed, but did not require, the city to continue issuing rebates annually for three years, and Mr. Bloomberg has been careful to avoid promising another one. Even yesterday, he left himself some wiggle room when talking about the future.</p>
        <p>''I would expect that we could do it, and my hope is that we could do it going forward,'' he said. ''If the city gets into very big trouble, then we will not.''</p>
        <p>The likelihood of another round of rebates this year prompted fresh criticism from those who objected to it last time around. Charles Brecher, director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-supported policy group, said that with the city facing a projected deficit of about $2 billion in the fiscal year that begins in July and an even larger one the following year, giving a quarter-billion dollars back to homeowners did not make sense.</p>
        <p>''The reasons why we considered it bad policy a year ago are likely to apply even more so in the coming year,'' Mr. Brecher said. ''It is even less affordable now.''</p>
        <p>This being an election year, and with the mayor eager to add the rebate to the list of achievements he will emphasize in coming months, it would be politically difficult for him to not offer it again. The rebate proved very popular, and for the most part was executed with few problems.</p>
        <p>To become eligible, homeowners had to sign up with the New York State School Tax Relief Program, or STAR, which provides tax reductions to New Yorkers who own their homes and use them as their primary residences. The checks for owners of houses and condominiums began appearing in mailboxes in October.</p>
        <p>But for co-op owners, the checks were much slower in coming because the city decided to send them directly to individual apartment owners rather than to their boards. And since the city's Finance Department has not had to keep detailed records of those people, identifying them took a little longer than anticipated, said Martha E. Stark, the finance commissioner.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Ms. Stark said that the process took longer because of a surge of applications before the Oct. 15 deadline. And she acknowledged some hiccups, including the intriguing fact that a few checks were mailed to homeowners who did not live at addresses listed on property records, because they were, um, no longer alive.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Stark said that over all, she was very pleased with the program's inaugural run. And now that the kinks have been worked out, she said, the process figures to be much smoother in coming years, assuming the rebate is repeated.</p>
        <p>''It's something that we're very proud of,'' she said. ''When you're doing a mailing of this size, there are bound to be a few errors, but we've managed to keep those errors to a minimum.''</p>
