        <p>When the Patriots took the field last Sunday with a patchwork defense, Floyd Reese watched the game on television with the expectation that their season was about to end.</p>
        <p>''I told my wife before the game, 'If they had Ty Law and all of their regulars, it would be a heck of a game,''' Reese, the Tennessee Titans' general manager, said Wednesday of the American Football Conference semifinal between New England and the Indianapolis Colts. ''But for them to go out and win without two Pro Bowlers against that offense is just incomprehensible. It's off the charts.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the N.F.L., executives are watching the Patriots' latest foray into the playoffs with wonder and respect, which is exactly how New England's owner, Robert K. Kraft, always longed for his team to be viewed.</p>
        <p>If the Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow at Heinz Field, New England will notch its third conference title in four seasons, which would be the best stretch since the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowl titles after the 1992, 1993 and 1995 seasons.</p>
        <p>The Patriots' run has occurred in the salary-cap era, elevating New England to an elite status. And the apparent gap between the Patriots and the league's other teams at times looks like a gulf. Kraft says he remembers when the Patriots were so irrelevant that few Boston stores carried their memorabilia. Now, every home game is a sellout.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to bring pride and a special feeling like they have in Green Bay or in Pittsburgh with the Rooney family,'' Kraft said in an interview last week. ''That was our objective from the day we bought the team.''</p>
        <p>Kraft's best moves may have been installing Bill Belichick as head coach and allowing Belichick's system to flourish.</p>
        <p>Once viewed as a meddler because of his fallout with Coach Bill Parcells over control of team personnel, Kraft has taken on a more supportive role.</p>
        <p>''No doubt that Mr. Kraft had it set in his mind what direction he wanted to go and how he wanted the team to be led,'' Reese said of the departure of Parcells, who left the Patriots after the 1996 season and took over the Jets. Kraft hired Belichick in 2000, ''probably one of his best all-time decisions,'' said Reese, who has known Belichick for 30 years.</p>
        <p>A common thread of Belichick's teams has been their ability to thrive despite injuries. In the N.F.L., injuries frighten general managers like nothing else. Last season, the Patriots won the Super Bowl despite using 42 starters over the course of the season.</p>
        <p>''We went through a similar thing this year,'' Reese said of his Titans. ''We won five games.''</p>
        <p>Mickey Loomis, the New Orleans Saints' general manager, grouped the Patriots with the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams as teams able to sustain success through adversity in recent years.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is any particular genius to it, and I don't think any of New England's guys would promote themselves as geniuses, but they do have a nice formula that's working,'' Loomis said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ''This era of football is about good coaching, good personnel decisions and managing your resources, and they are doing a good job in all three areas.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots -- like the 49ers during the 1980's -- have also made bold choices with their roster, jettisoning certain marquee players before their talent regressed.</p>
        <p>In trading quarterback Drew Bledsoe to Buffalo in 2002, the Patriots received a first-round draft pick. In waiving safety Lawyer Milloy before the 2003 season, they cut salary.</p>
        <p>Mike Giddings of Pro Scout Incorporated, a scouting service used by several N.F.L. teams, said the Patriots' success, while impressive, was not a mystery.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason that if New England is winning, another team shouldn't know why,'' Giddings said in a recent telephone interview. ''Other businesses can hide their secrets. If there is a new car, you won't know about it until it hits the road. But in our business, all you have to do is look at the waiver wire or put on a tape.''</p>
        <p>Belichick, Kraft and Scott Pioli, the vice president for player personnel, will be tested in the off-season. New England's defense, though brilliant, is aging. The coaching staff -- with the offensive coordinator Charlie Weis taking over at Notre Dame and the defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel a head-coaching candidate for the Cleveland Browns -- is in flux.</p>
        <p>''Maintaining is tougher than attaining,'' Kraft said. ''We've lost one coordinator; we have a high probability of losing another. We can't keep all of the players, but we have to be good managers and make good decisions.''</p>
        <p>The most recent evidence shows a Patriots team not sated by success. Reese, whose Titans faced the Patriots three times the last three seasons, looks at New England's accomplishments with amazement.</p>
        <p>''When you look at all of the teams in the playoffs, you don't stand up on a table and talk about how great their roster is,'' Reese said.</p>
        <p>''That's not to take anything away from the players, but their team concept probably works beyond the players in terms of what the coaching staff is able to do.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots' secondary, in the game Sunday against the Colts, ''faced the most prolific passing attack in the last few years with a middle-round draft pick at cornerback, a free-agent cornerback and a wide receiver,'' Reese said.</p>
        <p>''In a situation where a lot of other teams, executives and coaches would not give themselves a chance, they've been able to line up and do it.''</p>
