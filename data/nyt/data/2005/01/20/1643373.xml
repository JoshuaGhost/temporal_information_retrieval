        <p>WHEN Marlene Johnson's mortgage increased by $400 a month, she wasn't sure what to do. Her income from cleaning local houses and businesses was already stretched thin providing for herself and her 14-year-old daughter, Krystal, she said. So she decided to save their house with an old-fashioned bake sale -- on eBay.</p>
        <p>''Everybody loves to eat,'' she said. ''I was sitting here thinking, what can I do that everybody likes? That's when I came up with the cookie idea.''</p>

        <p>WHEN Marlene Johnson's mortgage increased by $400 a month, she wasn't sure what to do. Her income from cleaning local houses and businesses was already stretched thin providing for herself and her 14-year-old daughter, Krystal, she said. So she decided to save their house with an old-fashioned bake sale -- on eBay.</p>
        <p>''Everybody loves to eat,'' she said. ''I was sitting here thinking, what can I do that everybody likes? That's when I came up with the cookie idea.''</p>
        <p>For $100, customers receive nine packages, shipped for Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, the Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and a birthday. Each shipment contains chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar, butter and fudge cookies. Priority Mail shipping within the United States is an additional $45.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson went through a difficult divorce seven years ago, and legal bills left her bankrupt. ''It was like $35,000 by the time it was done,'' she said. ''It was one day at a time after that.''</p>
        <p>About a year ago, Ms. Johnson began selling odds and ends on eBay, but it wasn't until the mortgage increased on her house in Cohoes, N.Y., that she decided to market her baking talents. ''I usually get up around 5 a.m. when I have a lot of baking to do,'' she said. ''I let the cookies cool, and then I wrap them up. If they're going to be shipped, I like to do it immediately so it gets to them fresh.''</p>
        <p>Small packages of cookie samples are available for about $3.</p>
        <p>Though it might seem unusual to commission cookies from a stranger, on the eBay scale of oddity, it ranks pretty low.</p>
        <p>''They had this lady last night who was selling an M&amp;M; she said she saw Jesus in it,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''My friend was telling me last night that one guy sold an air guitar. EBay is really funny like that.''</p>
