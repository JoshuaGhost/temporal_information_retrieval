        <p>Bond 45, 154 West 45th Street, gives no hint of its former life as the old Bond men's store. The 240-seat restaurant, which opens on Friday, has the look of a well-aged brasserie, thanks to recycled tiles from Italy and antique lights. Sheldon Fireman, the owner, has put Brando de Oliviera, left, in charge of a vast antipasto and an encyclopedic menu. Fresh mozzarella will be made at a counter and cheese-filled focaccias from Liguria will be baked in special ovens and pans: 212-869-4545.</p>
        <p>Liz Arana and Eran Shahaf have opened Alexandra, 455 Hudson Street (Morton Street), a cozy bistro. Ms. Arana, previously at Provence, cooks seasonal American fare. Mr. Sharaf, her husband, runs the dining room: 212-255-3838.</p>

        <p>Moules frites are now on the menu in the Times Square area with the opening of Belgian BXL Cafe, a pub at 125 West 43rd Street. Belgian dishes like carbonnades are also served: 212-768-0200.</p>
        <p>In Paris Alain Ducasse plans to take over Benoit, a Parisian bistro that opened in 1912. A final agreement has not been signed. The owner, Michel Petit, who has run the place since 1959, is a grandson of Benoit Matray, the founder, and may stay as a consultant.</p>
        <p>Chefs on the Move: Sara Jenkins has left the kitchen at 50 Carmine in Greenwich Village. At Craft the new chef de cuisine is Damon Wise. Ivy Stark has left Dos Caminos for Rosa Mexicano. John Schenk, who once owned Clementine in New York and then went to Las Vegas, is now the chef at the new Houston branch of Strip House.</p>
