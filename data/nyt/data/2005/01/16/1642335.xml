        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As concertgoers, we were not impressed by the elegant new entrance to the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts (Jan. 2). We were distressed by the planners' disregard for the convenience of the audience.</p>
        <p>Parking is now more difficult. We always come early so that we can park nearby in case of inclement weather and sit inside the lobby. For the first two concerts, not enough seats were provided and we had to stand for an hour.</p>

        <p>Parking is now more difficult. We always come early so that we can park nearby in case of inclement weather and sit inside the lobby. For the first two concerts, not enough seats were provided and we had to stand for an hour.</p>
        <p>Disabled people (and there are many who go to classical concerts) were grumbling about the difficulty they had with the new luxurious stairs. Only one elevator seemed to be in service. Down with facades, up with people!</p>
