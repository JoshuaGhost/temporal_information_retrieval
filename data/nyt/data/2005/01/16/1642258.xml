        <p>IT seems that more photography books are being published now than ever before, and that the number of publishers with lists devoted entirely to photography has never been higher. Could it be that people are reading less and looking at pictures more, or has the rapidly rising price of photographs sent would-be collectors in search of alternatives? Whatever cultural forces are at work, books on photography are having their moment in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>Among the new photography books is a substantial volume that takes on the subject of photography books themselves. ''The Photobook: A History, Volume I'' approaches the photography book as if it were a medium all its own. It surveys more than 200 books going back to photography's origins and includes information about the social issues and artistic climate of their day, as well as the circumstances of their publication. ''The Photobook'' begins with photography's introduction as a scientific tool and charts its progress as a form of creative expression -- dual purposes that, over the years, grew into a nagging source of tension for photographers and scholars alike. How can a medium with so many utilitarian applications, the question goes, hold its own as a valid art form?</p>

        <p>Among the new photography books is a substantial volume that takes on the subject of photography books themselves. ''The Photobook: A History, Volume I'' approaches the photography book as if it were a medium all its own. It surveys more than 200 books going back to photography's origins and includes information about the social issues and artistic climate of their day, as well as the circumstances of their publication. ''The Photobook'' begins with photography's introduction as a scientific tool and charts its progress as a form of creative expression -- dual purposes that, over the years, grew into a nagging source of tension for photographers and scholars alike. How can a medium with so many utilitarian applications, the question goes, hold its own as a valid art form?</p>
        <p>Martin Parr, one of the book's two authors, a photographer and a member of the Magnum photo agency, has been a serious collector of photography books for years. The volumes in ''Photobook'' are drawn heavily from his own collection, the choices made with his co-author, Gerry Badger, a photographer, curator and critic in Britain. The selection includes many books that have come to define photography.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parr was 20 years old, in 1972, when he bought his first photography book -- Robert Frank's ''The Americans,'' which had first been published in the United States in 1959. A French edition had been published the previous year, but its photographs appeared as illustrations of essays by serious writers, making the book more of a documentary work. The American edition stripped the texts away, leaving only a new introduction by Jack Kerouac, allowing the pictures to tell the story. ''It opened my eyes to the potential of photography,'' Mr. Parr writes in ''The Photobook.'' ''It showed me that the medium can interpret feelings as well as describing places.'' He continues, ''The combination of remarkable images and good design in a book that is beautiful to open and pleasurable to leaf through is an ideal way of conveying a photographer's ideas and statements.''</p>
        <p>Thumbing through a photography book and getting lost in the pictures is an intimate, sensate experience. It draws on a different part of the imagination than reading does. In the introduction to ''The Photobook,'' the photographer Lewis Baltz is quoted as saying that ''you might think of photography as a narrow, deep area between the novel and film.'' In fact, it was the steppingstone between the two mediums. In books, photographs assume a state of permanence, preserved on the page for the ages. But in series, they do more than tell a story -- they begin to tell how that story is told. And modern printing techniques have become so advanced that there is often little variation in quality between a fine photograph and its published version. In the barrage of moving imagery all around us, the photography book offers a welcome respite, a brief moment of extended contemplation.</p>
        <p>The first commonly acknowledged photography book in ''The Photobook'' is ''The Pencil of Nature,'' published in Britain in the 1840's, by William Henry Fox Talbot, one of photography's inventors. Beaumont Newhall, whose 1964 book about the history of photography was definitive for many years, called ''The Pencil of Nature'' a manifesto, as well as an advertisement, an experiment, a calling card, an aesthetic achievement and a polemic. ''It was a show book, an account of the history of the invention and a demonstration of its accomplishment in the form of 24 actual photographs.''</p>
        <p>Many of the more idiosyncratic choices in ''The Photobook'' tell us just as much about the history of photography. Among them is ''The Moon: Considered as a Planet, A World, and a Satellite,'' by James Nasmyth and James Carpenter, published in London in 1874. Photographers of that period used large glass negatives that required a wet collodion coating. Since the plates could not be kept damp through long nighttime exposures, Mr. Nasmyth, an engineer, and Mr. Carpenter, an astronomer, built large-scale plaster models of the lunar surface, then lighted them in a studio to produce artificial moonscapes that could fool any unwitting eye. As ingenious as it was unscientific, ''The Moon'' says a lot about how photography was being used, or abused, in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Another curious book, ''Facies Dolorosa'' (The Face of Pain), was published in Germany in 1934 by Dr. Hans Killian, who photographed patients in bed and close up, labeling each image with the patient's illness. The photographs were meant for his medical research, but they show us moments between life and death with a haunting beauty that transports them into the realm of photographic art.</p>
        <p>From ''The Photobook,'' questions arise about the way contemporaneously published photography books have influenced one another. Consider these books published within a four-year span: ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' by Walker Evans and James Agee (1941); ''An American Exodus,'' by Dorothea Lange and Paul S. Taylor (1939); and ''You Have Seen their Faces,'' by Margaret Bourke-White and Erskine Caldwell (1937) -- all collaborations between writer and photographer, all focusing on the impoverished conditions of the Great Depression. Were these photographers -- among the most important of their generation -- in competition with one another, or was each of them taking on the big subject of the era? The first of this type of collaboration was a book called ''Roll, Jordan, Roll,'' by Doris Ulmann and Julia Peterkin (1933). That, too, was about rural poverty, in this case black laborers on a southern estate. Was this book a template for the others?</p>
        <p>The question comes up again with ''Observations,'' Richard Avedon's collaboration with Truman Capote, published in 1959, and ''Moments Preserved,'' by Irving Penn, published in 1960. Here are the two reigning fashion photographers of their day; both books were even printed at the same press in Switzerland. While ''Observations'' is a book of portraits with profiles of each subject, ''Moments Preserved'' includes a broader range of Penn's work; his many portraits, however, are accompanied by his own ''observations'' of those subjects. Again, coincidence, rivalry, or just a cultural moment?</p>
        <p>Even ''The Americans'' came close on the heels of ''The Europeans'' (1955), Henri Cartier-Bresson's book of photographs of post-war life on the Continent -- a coincidence that has been little noted.</p>
        <p>More to the point today is the very publication of ''The Photobook.'' Several years ago, ''The Book of 101 Books'' was published in limited edition by Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York, a beautiful volume about photography books of the 20th century. (A companion exhibition at the International Center of Photography is scheduled for this summer.) Both volumes cover similar terrain. ''The Book of 101 Books'' contains a number of titles not included in the ''The Photobook,'' but the latter goes into greater detail about photo propaganda books from the early 20th century, and experimental photography books that came out of the Provoke period in Japan in the 1960's; it also promises a second volume, which will presumably fill in some of the gaps.</p>
        <p>So, why would two such similar books appear in such close proximity? Maybe photography's stock is rising. In New York City alone, there are more than 100 venues to view photography exhibitions. More and more artists are embracing photography and exploring its properties in new ways. Not to mention the intersection of technology and commerce: inexpensive digital cameras, cellphones, personal computers and portable printers are enabling consumers to become prolific photo-chroniclers of everything around them.</p>
        <p>When asked if he would rather see his own photographs on a gallery wall or in a book, Mr. Parr was unequivocal. ''In a book,'' he said in a recent interview. ''I love the sense of the package, a traveling idea. Someone can pick it up and the idea can explode in their face. The book is a perfect vehicle for photography.'' Something to keep in mind if you don't want to spend that $20,000 for an edition print by your favorite photographer.</p>
