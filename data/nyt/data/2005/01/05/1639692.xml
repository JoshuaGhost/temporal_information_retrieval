        <p>Broadway Has Record Week</p>
        <p>Broadway set a box office record last week. For the seven days that ended on Sunday, Broadway's 31 shows brought in $22,069,511. That beat the previous record, for the week ended Dec. 29, 2002, by more than $718,000, according to figures released by the League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade organization. It was the eighth-highest week of attendance on Broadway, with 288,785 tickets sold. But in terms of the average number of seats filled per show -- 9,315 -- it was Broadway's second-best week. Broadway has seen an increase in ticket sales for the end of the year, and sales for 2004 over all were up 3.2 percent as of last Sunday, at $748.9 million.</p>
        <p>More From Bruckheimer</p>
        <p>It has been a good year so far for the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, right. On Monday two networks ordered pilots from Mr. Bruckheimer, the producer of ''CSI'' and its spinoffs. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Bruckheimer will produce a pilot episode of ''E-Ring'' -- described as a Pentagon ''West Wing'' -- for NBC, and an untitled drama about a prodigy and his mentor, and said to be similar to ''Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' for the WB network. Of the top five most popular shows on television, three -- ''CSI,'' ''CSI: Miami'' and ''Without a Trace'' -- are Bruckheimer productions.</p>
        <p>Theater News</p>
        <p>Tom Wopat, below, will join the cast of the new revival of David Mamet's ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' this spring, joining Alan Alda, Liev Schreiber, Jeffrey Tambor, Frederick Weller and Gordon Clapp. It will be Mr. Wopat's first dramatic role on Broadway, after his appearances in the musicals ''42nd Street'' and ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' for which he received a Tony nomination. He will play James Lingk, the unwitting investor who falls prey to the master salesman Ricky Roma. The revival of ''Glengarry,'' staged by Joe Mantello, will begin performances on April 8 at the Royale Theater on West 45th Street, and open on May 1. The Signature Theater Company has announced the casting for its final production of the season, Paula Vogel's ''Hot 'n' Throbbing.'' The show, about a woman who writes erotic screenplays to support her family, will star Lisa Emery, Suli Holum, Elias Koteas, Tom Nelis, Matthew Stadelmann and Rebecca Wisocky. It will be directed by Les Waters and will begin performances at the Signature's Peter Norton Space on West 42nd Street on March 8. It will be the third play by Ms. Vogel performed this season by the Signature, the Off Broadway company that devotes its programming each season to the work of a single playwright.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Daniel Barenboim, below, has withdrawn from four concerts this month with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where he is the music director, to recover from a back injury. The concerts, from Jan. 20 to 25, were subscription performances of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis. Mr. Barenboim, 62, was advised by his doctor to reduce his workload while he recovers from herniated disks in his back from an injury last summer, the symphony said in a statement. His replacement will be Helmuth Rilling. The Bronx Opera will begin its 37th season this weekend with performances of Gian-Carlo Menotti's infrequently staged work ''The Consul.'' It will play at the Lovinger Theater at Lehman College in the Bronx on Saturday and Sunday, and move to the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College in Manhattan next weekend. Tickets and information: (718)402-5202.</p>
