        <p>A Cook County Circuit Court judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a Chicago woman against William Kennedy Smith, a nephew of Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The woman, Audra Soulias, 28, who was Mr. Smith's assistant at the nonprofit Center for International Rehabilitation, accused Mr. Smith of sexually assaulting her in 1999. Reuters reported that because of the time elapsed since the incident, the suit focused on telephone messages Mr. Smith left Ms. Soulias before the suit was filed and that the judge, William Maddux, said they did not merit a complaint. Mr. Smith, who was acquitted on criminal rape charges in Florida in 1991, denied assaulting her.</p>
