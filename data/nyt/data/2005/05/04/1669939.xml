        <p>The family of a carpet installer who was killed in the crash of the Staten Island ferry in October 2003 will receive $450,000 from the city. It is the first legal settlement related to a death caused by the accident, which killed 11 people, city officials said. The claim, filed by the estate of John A. Valinski, left, a 40-year-old Staten Island resident, is among 191 claims totaling $3.3 billion. Though 79 cases have been settled for a total of $2.7 million, none involved passengers who died, the city comptroller's office said.</p>
