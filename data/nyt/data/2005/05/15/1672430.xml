        <p>After a really intense hike on tough terrain, complete with top-of-the-world views, who really wants to sleep in a tent? These hotels offer accommodations as lofty as the mountain treks that preceded them. Lake Placid Lodge A concierge doles out trail maps (or arranges guided hikes) and picnic lunches, including a blanket and a bottle of wine, for some of the nearly 50 4,000-foot-high peaks that dot this area of the Adirondacks. Don't miss Noonmark Mountain; the views of Lake Champlain are breathtaking. Go to www.lakeplacidlodge.com. Twin Farms Rooms start at a cool $1,050 a night in this luxe Vermont inn. There are five miles of private beginner and intermediate trails on the 300-acre property. But the hiking is more challenging in the surrounding area -- try Camel's Hump, Mount Ascutney or the Appalachian Trail. Go to www.twinfarms.com. Riffelalp Resort With views of the Matterhorn, this Swiss resort sits 7,290 feet above sea level and borders a pine forest. The Zermatt Alpine Center arranges six-hour glacier tours and ''four-thousander'' (4,000-meter) ascents. Less ambitious hikers can have trains deposit them at higher-altitude rambling areas, a great way to visit nearby mountain huts for home-cooked meals. Go to www.zermatt.ch/riffelalp.</p>
