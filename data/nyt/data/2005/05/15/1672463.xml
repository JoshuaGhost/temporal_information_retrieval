        <p>James Zemaitis, the 36-year-old head of Sotheby's 20th-century-design department, isn't someone you'd expect to find in the rarefied world of international auction houses. His taste in clothing runs toward bright orange corduroy pants. He says he doesn't have a decorating bone in his body, compares himself with the vinyl-collecting, Top-5-list-making slacker in Nick Hornby's novel ''High Fidelity'' and notes proudly that he got home from a weeklong trip to Japan ''in time for the second half of the Super Bowl.'' At his Manhattan apartment, one of his most prized possessions is not a painting or a sculpture, or even a piece of classic modernist furniture, but rather a vintage chrome soda siphon by Norman Bel Geddes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Zemaitis doesn't seem to fit any of the auction-world stereotypes. He didn't grow up rich or connected; an art-history degree, boyish charm and energy -- lots of energy -- were his only tickets into the field. It is not as if the other auction houses don't have talented experts, but it is Zemaitis who is the It Boy of the booming 20th-century-design market, which is now roughly split between the postwar and prewar eras. His carefully edited sales -- showcased in stylish exhibitions and presented in informative, well-researched and meticulously designed catalogs -- have not only charmed veteran collectors but have also helped attract a new generation of buyers.</p>

        <p>James Zemaitis, the 36-year-old head of Sotheby's 20th-century-design department, isn't someone you'd expect to find in the rarefied world of international auction houses. His taste in clothing runs toward bright orange corduroy pants. He says he doesn't have a decorating bone in his body, compares himself with the vinyl-collecting, Top-5-list-making slacker in Nick Hornby's novel ''High Fidelity'' and notes proudly that he got home from a weeklong trip to Japan ''in time for the second half of the Super Bowl.'' At his Manhattan apartment, one of his most prized possessions is not a painting or a sculpture, or even a piece of classic modernist furniture, but rather a vintage chrome soda siphon by Norman Bel Geddes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Zemaitis doesn't seem to fit any of the auction-world stereotypes. He didn't grow up rich or connected; an art-history degree, boyish charm and energy -- lots of energy -- were his only tickets into the field. It is not as if the other auction houses don't have talented experts, but it is Zemaitis who is the It Boy of the booming 20th-century-design market, which is now roughly split between the postwar and prewar eras. His carefully edited sales -- showcased in stylish exhibitions and presented in informative, well-researched and meticulously designed catalogs -- have not only charmed veteran collectors but have also helped attract a new generation of buyers.</p>
        <p>''My passion for design follows the same methodology as the vinyl junkie's,'' Zemaitis explains. ''Record collecting is about pastoral nostalgia -- joining the Kinks in the craving of an unsullied village green, or the beautiful loneliness of a train engineer on a forgotten Southern railroad as essayed by R.E.M. in the 1980's. Furniture collecting can evoke the same exact mood, but with a mod twist. It's wishing you could sit in a conversation pit by Alexander Girard by the fire in a Santa Fe home in 1972, or be Pierre Koenig himself in the famous Julius Shulman photograph of Case Study House No. 21.''</p>
        <p>Though 20th-century modernist furniture and objects have always attracted serious buyers, only in the last few years have they become status symbols for young, moneyed collectors. These buyers have apartments full of A-list contemporary art, a need for pedigreed modernist furniture to match and enough money to pay, say, $680,000 for a pair of lacquered steel doors by the French designer Jean Prouvé (taken from a prefab built for use in Congo) or a little more than $250,000 for a rare table by Le Corbusier, his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand (who collaborated on much of the furniture to come out of Corbusier's studio and whose own designs have become white hot for collectors). And these are just two recent examples of the breathtaking prices that postwar pieces are commanding. Zemaitis himself has come to personify the essential qualities of the milieu in which he operates -- scholarship and showmanship, hard work and dumb luck, sophistication and almost nerdy obsessiveness.</p>
        <p>In early February, he went to Tokyo to meet with the widow of Shiro Kuramata, a designer of witty, sometimes surreal furniture who made his name in the 80's and died in 1991. Zemaitis was investigating a rumor that Kuramata's widow had authorized production of a new run of Miss Blanche, a limited-production chair made of acrylic and embedded with paper roses, which has become wildly collectible -- and which Zemaitis would love to put into a sale. (The rumor proved false, to the relief of any collector who counts on the chair's rarity to keep values high.) Or he'll find himself evaluating an estate -- as he did at a deteriorating house built by Oscar Stonorov, a Philadelphia Modernist who was a great friend of Le Corbusier's -- only to come upon that $250,000 table by Le Corbusier and company, an early version of a well-known design and one of perhaps three ever made.</p>
        <p>Zemaitis, like his colleagues at the other auction houses and dealers in the 20th-century field, is taking full advantage of modernism's moment in the sun. The high prices brought by already famous designers like Prouvé and Perriand are driving up those for the work of less well-known people, like the cultish San Francisco designer John Dickinson (whose furniture tended toward the fantastical -- plaster tables with animal legs or tables covered in draped tin) or exuberant Brazilian Modernist architects like Oscar Niemeyer or Sergio Rodrigues. ''Our department has the opportunity to become a tastemaker,'' Zemaitis boasts. ''You can't do that in the old-master department.''</p>
        <p>Reed Krakoff, the creative director of Coach and one of the new breed of collectors with notable holdings in 20th-century art and design, describes Zemaitis as ''almost like a magazine editor, wanting to make it sexy and interesting and new. And that's what creates this dynamism that's been missing from the auction world.'' That lack of dynamism didn't mean the market was in a slump. Last year, Sotheby's sold more than $25 million worth of 20th-century design, and its chief rival, Christie's, sold nearly $23 million. The issue was, instead, one of perception. The major American auction houses had always focused primarily on decorative arts from the early part of the century, like Tiffany lamps, Gallé glass or Arts and Crafts furniture, all of which are extremely profitable. (In December, a Tiffany lamp sold at Sotheby's for $568,000 -- not a record, and not terribly unusual.) Modernist and contemporary design, on the other hand -- much of which was intended for production in quantity -- was more of a hit-or-miss proposition. It was common to find catalogs full of Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau furniture with a few modern pieces thrown in at the end. ''This was a pot that needed to be stirred,'' says John C. Waddell, a prominent collector of American modernist design. ''I've been collecting early modernism, but no thanks to the auction houses, who wanted to sell Lalique.''</p>
        <p>Zemaitis started stirring that pot in 2001, when he joined the 20th-century-design department at what was then called Phillips, de Pury &amp; Luxembourg (now Phillips, de Pury &amp; Company), where he and Alexander Payne, who now runs the department, assembled attention-getting sales. They also began selling contemporary design by people like Ron Arad and Marc Newson, in addition to vintage 20th-century pieces. Soon Zemaitis was attracting attention in the press. It was in a 2003 article in House &amp; Garden that he made the infamous statement that he and his department had taken ''a blood vow . . . that we'll never, ever sell a piece of Lalique.'' It's a crack that still haunts him, even though it was meant more as a statement of purpose -- that he and his team weren't interested in business as usual -- than a statement of fact. (Indeed, Zemaitis's first Phillips sale included a Tiffany chandelier.)</p>
        <p>As fate would have it, Zemaitis would be lured away in 2003 by Sotheby's, which -- while wanting to beef up its postwar 20th-century sales by hiring him -- is still keen to sell the very things that don't fit into Zemaitis's supercool worldview.</p>
        <p>The rap on Zemaitis is that he has been lucky, getting where he is today on charm and fortuitous timing, and winning all the attention for his high-profile postwar sales -- some of which he didn't even bring in himself -- while the real money in his department is made by the people who sell Tiffany. But Zemaitis is quick not to take credit where credit isn't due. He makes it clear, for example, that while he participated in the sale of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in 2003, he didn't bring in the business. (It came through Nancy McClelland, an auction-world veteran turned art adviser, and her partner, Lars Rachen, who were representing the house's owner, Lord Palumbo.)</p>
        <p>Nor, as Zemaitis also acknowledges, did he personally land the Équipement Intérieur collection of furniture and architectural artifacts (including the megabucks doors) by Jean Prouvé, Charlotte Perriand and others that belonged to Robert Rubin, the commodities trader turned architectural historian who restored one of the prefabricated metal houses that Prouvé and his brother designed for use in French colonial Africa. Rubin has sold collections at Sotheby's in the past, and is friendly with its president and chief executive officer, Bill Ruprecht. But Rubin says he decided to give this collection to Sotheby's only after Ruprecht told him that he had hired Zemaitis -- which, says Rubin (who has admired Zemaitis since his first Phillips sale), ''is what I'd been telling him to do.'' Zemaitis takes pains to acknowledge the contributions of the people in his department and the client-services staff members, who shepherd Sotheby's good customers through the presale exhibitions. ''I have to laugh at the comments I made a couple of years ago,'' he now says, adding, ''if you can bring in more Tiffany lamps at a half-million a pop, you can afford to experiment with Edward Durell Stone,'' referring to the original architect of the embattled 2 Columbus Circle, whose little-known postwar furniture designs are a special favorite of his.</p>
        <p>The customers can afford to experiment, too, armed with buckets of money and accompanied by posses of art advisers, dealers, architects and decorators -- many of whom buy on behalf of their clients (and may receive a percentage of the purchase price). And the more collectors there are, the greater the competition for the same Isamu Noguchi sofa, Jean Royère lamp or, more recently, 1970's pieces by designers like the American Paul Evans or the Frenchwoman Maria Pergay. One result is that the definition of what is fashionable keeps expanding.</p>
        <p>''The 18th century represented the blue-chip, I-have-arrived look,'' says Lee Mindel, a partner in the architecture firm Shelton, Mindel &amp; Associates and a very big buyer of 20th-century furniture for his clients. ''Now it represents your grandmother.'' Mindel and his clients much prefer the organic wooden tables by George Nakashima and the stylized modernity of Gio Ponti, or Prouvé and Perriand's more industrial aesthetic. ''The message of it is not as precious,'' he says. Which is interesting when you consider that Mindel recently bought, for a client, a rare Perriand table from a French dealer for more than a million dollars. Still, Mindel insists that it's a question of the aura that a piece of furniture projects, not its price. ''We have clients who have a piece by Alexandre Noll,'' he says, referring to the French sculptor whose carved wood chairs, cabinets and objects are commanding steep prices these days, ''and they have three kids, who throw their backpacks on it.''</p>
        <p>Twentieth-century design is a priority of all three major auction houses these days, for the simple reason that it is relatively plentiful and therefore, with the exception of some really rare or especially desirable pieces, still fairly inexpensive, meaning that prices can only go up. (Except when reproductions become a problem. The market for all but the rarest pieces by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson collapsed a few years ago, in part because of readily available copies, themselves fueled, paradoxically, by the renewed popular interest in modernism.)</p>
        <p>Many observers say that prices for 20th-century design are high, but as Mindel points out, ''the best piece of furniture is still much less expensive than the best piece of art.'' It's something that you hear over and over in the design world. Zesty Myers, a partner in the Manhattan gallery R 20th Century, says: ''The question is: What does a billionaire want? If they are paying $12 million for a Damien Hirst shark, they'll pay $1 million for a chair.'' In some cases, collectors will bypass a lower-priced version of a similar item at a dealer's only to get caught up in a bidding war at auction and end up spending far more -- a phenomenon that leaves some dealers understandably dismayed.</p>
        <p>Zemaitis's reaction to all this is that it's just part of the game. ''Whenever possible,'' he says, ''you price pieces far below what the retail value is, but people are more than willing to get into bidding wars, so prices can go above retail.''</p>
        <p>Still, as many experts in the field point out, the market finds its own level sooner or later. ''I can't control the market from the podium,'' maintains Richard Wright, one of the owners of Wright auctions, a Chicago house that has become known for its sales of postwar design. Robert Rubin says: ''I'm a great believer in reversion to the mean. If you sell 50 or 100 objects, you're going to come out with some predictable result.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Zemaitis is already onto the next thing. His June sale will include a rare three-legged chair by the Danish modernist Poul Kjaerholm -- ''the holy grail for Kjaerholm collectors,'' according to Zemaitis -- as well as a sideboard by Pierre Koenig, the California architect known for his Case Study houses. But Zemaitis isn't complacent. Sotheby's may have beaten Christie's soundly in the midseason March sales ($6 million dollars to their $1 million), but, as he admits: ''Both Sotheby's and Christie's are so large that a collection can be won no matter who is in the department. Christie's will probably bounce back in June.''</p>
        <p>Indeed. In its upcoming sale, Christie's is selling major pieces -- some with six-figure estimates -- by Noll, Perriand, Jean-Michel Frank and others, owned by the noted Greek art collector Dakis Joannou. It is a sale, says Joshua Holdeman, the head of Christie's 20th-century-design department in New York, for which the house successfully outmaneuvered Sotheby's. And Phillips is featuring chairs by Ettore Sottsass (whose Memphis furniture from the 1980's is poised for a comeback) and Oscar Niemeyer.</p>
        <p>''It can flip on you at any moment,'' Zemaitis says. ''That's what keeps you up at night.''</p>
