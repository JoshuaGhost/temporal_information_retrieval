        <p>Peter Maass's article (May 1) on counterinsurgency in Iraq was both well done and frightening. Certainly it does not appear that Iraq is a burgeoning democracy. Strong Shiite, Sunni and Kurd militias seem to suggest prolonged political instability, despite the promises and hopes of the new interim government. Maass clearly documents this with his recounting of the endurance of similar insurgency-counterinsurgency struggles around the globe.</p>
