        <p>GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL has had cameos in lots of movies, including ''The Fisher King,'' with its romantic grand waltz sequence, and ''North by Northwest,'' with Cary Grant blending into the crowd on the Main Concourse. In the new DreamWorks film ''Madagascar,'' the famous train station even serves as the backdrop for an adventurous zebra and his pals -- a lion, a hippopotamus, a giraffe and four scheming penguins. No film permits were needed, as the crew built their own Grand Central from scratch with software.</p>
        <p>''It's almost as if someone who was doing a live-action shoot decided to replicate a set of Grand Central, built it to scale and lit it,'' said Kendal Cronkhite, the film's production designer. ''That's kind of what ours is except it's done virtually, in the computer.''</p>

        <p>GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL has had cameos in lots of movies, including ''The Fisher King,'' with its romantic grand waltz sequence, and ''North by Northwest,'' with Cary Grant blending into the crowd on the Main Concourse. In the new DreamWorks film ''Madagascar,'' the famous train station even serves as the backdrop for an adventurous zebra and his pals -- a lion, a hippopotamus, a giraffe and four scheming penguins. No film permits were needed, as the crew built their own Grand Central from scratch with software.</p>
        <p>''It's almost as if someone who was doing a live-action shoot decided to replicate a set of Grand Central, built it to scale and lit it,'' said Kendal Cronkhite, the film's production designer. ''That's kind of what ours is except it's done virtually, in the computer.''</p>
        <p>Digging through mountains of reference material, including original blueprints and photographic essays like ''Grand Central: Gateway to a Million Lives,'' by John Belle and Maxinne R. Leighton (W.W. Norton, 2000), Ms. Cronkhite and her crew recreated the station down to the zodiac ceiling mural, chandeliers and gleaming marble surfaces. Even the famous clock at the information desk is there. The directors, Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, worked in a humorous bit with Melman, the neurotic giraffe played by David Schwimmer, getting his head stuck in the clock.</p>
        <p>''Madagascar,'' which opens on May 27, features other New York landmarks as well. Marty (a zebra with the voice of Chris Rock) sneaks out of the Central Park Zoo and ambles down Fifth Avenue, through Rockefeller Center and over to Times Square before winding up at the ticket booth in Grand Central for a train to the wilds of Connecticut. His pals -- Melman, Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett-Smith)-- soon catch up with him after a ride on the Lexington Avenue subway.</p>
        <p>To create a stylized and stylish Manhattan, Ms. Cronkhite and her design team spent more than a year developing the look of the film before production started. She and the directors cited a variety of visual sources for the characters and backgrounds, including the films of Woody Allen, photographs by Alfred Stieglitz, Warner Brothers cartoons from the 1950's and 1960's and their own videotaped jaunts through the city. They also looked at children's books, including Miroslav Sasek's 1960 classic ''This Is New York,'' where an illustration of the 14th Street train platform inspires the look of the subway scene. ''New York is New York and there's no place like it,'' Mr. McGrath said.</p>
        <p>But it is majestic Grand Central, full of light and shadows and obsessive detail that stands out in the film's New York sequences. ''It's such an icon,'' said Mr. Darnell. ''Even people who've never been to New York City know about Grand Central station.''</p>
