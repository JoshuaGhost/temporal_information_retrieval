        <p>STANLEY GREENBERG, an American pollster, was reading the morning British papers the other day when he saw something unusual among the torrent of articles about the coming national election here: a full-page photograph of a naked woman. Mr. Greenberg, an adviser to the Labor Party, was sitting in the campaign's war room in London and glanced around nervously, but his British colleagues were hardly surprised.</p>
        <p>In four days, voters are likely to return Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party to power, handing a third consecutive defeat to the Conservatives. Inevitably, the British have provided more evidence of the globalization of American campaign politics -- from a get-out-the-vote meeting here in western England that could have taken place in Des Moines, to echoes of language as Mr. Blair lambasted his opponent, Michael Howard, as ''extreme'' and Mr. Howard hammered Mr. Blair as untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>Yet what may prove more revealing are not the similarities but the differences between the two countries, differences that some analysts argue are not flattering to an American system that has changed under the weight of money, television advertisements and tightly scripted candidate appearances.</p>
        <p>Under government strictures that would be hard to imagine in the United States -- including how long the campaigns last, how much money the candidates are allowed to spend and what they can spend it on -- the British campaign is arguably more substantial and revealing of the candidates' views and qualifications than what can be found in the United States.</p>
        <p>''British elections are very unlike American elections,'' said Robert M. Worcester, a British pollster. ''They are short and they are sharp.''</p>
        <p>The daily barrage of television advertisements that is the spine of American presidential campaigns is absent here -- prohibited by a British law that restricts the major parties to five advertisements of two and a half minutes that are each shown only once in the 30-day election season. The campaigns try to make it up with billboards spotted all over Britain, like a tart Tory poster that reads, ''Are you thinking what we're thinking?'' a not too subtle reference to Mr. Howard's suggestion that the country is overrun by immigrants.</p>
        <p>The ban on television advertisements means that campaigns cost a lot less: the parties are limited to spending just under Â£20 million a year (about $38 million), a fraction of what is spent in American presidential campaigns. That spares the candidates the daily obligation of appearing at fund-raisers and calling donors, activities that eat up a big chunk of an American politician's day. The British system places no limits on contributions, but constrains who can contribute and imposes strict requirements on disclosure. Finally, the official campaign is limited to about one month, starting from the moment the prime minister calls for an election, though a shadow campaign has been going on from the moment Mr. Howard was elected Tory leader in 2003.</p>
        <p>To appreciate the difference between the political cultures, consider this: on Thursday, British viewers could turn on ''Question Time'' on BBC and watch Mr. Howard, Mr. Blair and Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats, sitting alone on a stage for 30 minutes, as they were pummeled by an often hostile and informed audience that was screened by independent producers precisely to make sure its members were tough and knowledgeable. Mr. Blair was hammered about his support of the Iraq war, while Mr. Howard was peppered with accusations that his stand on immigration is racist. By the end, both candidates appeared flustered and agitated; the morning's Daily Mail featured a photograph of Mr. Blair with sweat dripping down his face.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of like inviting your presidential candidate to do the 'Jerry Springer Show,''' said Mark Penn, an American pollster who, like Mr. Greenberg, has advised Bill Clinton and is now aiding Mr. Blair.</p>
        <p>AT first glance, the format might seem similar to the almost daily question-and-answer sessions that President Bush held during his campaign. But Mr. Bush's audiences were carefully screened, consisting only of supporters.</p>
        <p>The British parties, in a tradition that goes back to when William Gladstone was prime minister in the 19th century, start the campaigns by releasing detailed manifestos that lay out in highly specific terms what the party will do over the next term. ''Because it's done collectively, it means the ministers and prime ministers are bound by the manifesto,'' said Pippa Norris, a lecturer in comparative politics at Harvard University. ''It's a real document, unlike the American platform.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the United States, Britain has no tradition of debates. But the ban on regular television advertising forces the candidates to wage a battle for attention in a forum that has become increasingly marginalized in America -- the news media. The 11 national newspapers are filled every morning with pages and pages of articles on the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair and Mr. Howard seek to fill that space by giving lengthy and rigorous daily news conferences, where they take question after question. Mr. Blair, at a single session the other morning, probably took more questions than either John Kerry or Mr. Bush did at news conferences throughout their entire campaigns.</p>
        <p>There are some important caveats here. The British process -- which consists of 646 separate elections for members of Parliament, rather than a direct election for prime minister -- would probably not work in the United States. It is hard to imagine Americans agreeing to restrictions on spending and advertisements that might seem to run afoul of the United States Constitution.</p>
        <p>In addition, an election that officially lasts only a month can make it harder to do the on-the-ground organizing that has become so critical to American democracy. ''In an election where they call it 30 days ahead of time, the system works against building citizen involvement,'' said Joe Trippi, an American political consultant who has advised the Labor campaign and who worked for Howard Dean.</p>
        <p>Further, while the length, stress and scrutiny of an American campaign can seem daunting, some analysts argue that it helps pinpoint potential shortfalls of candidates. ''It's bruising and God knows it's long-winded,'' said Jonathan Freedland, a columnist for The Guardian. ''But in the end, if you're not up to it, I don't think you make it through the process. You can see that with a Dukakis or a Howard Dean. There are people in our system who didn't have what it takes and managed to get through: John Major and Edward Heath.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Penn, the pollster, thinks that by and large the British system gives voters a fair look at the candidates. He said he was surprised and pleased to learn that the campaign message managed to get through here, even without advertising.</p>
        <p>And he said United States politics might learn some lessons. ''The openness in answering questions, making that a strength instead of a weakness,'' he said. ''Why shouldn't American presidential candidates do a briefing every day?''</p>
