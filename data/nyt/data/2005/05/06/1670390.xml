        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain returned to power on Friday for a record-setting third successive term, according to official election results, with a much reduced majority reflecting his unpopularity over the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>The margin was Mr. Blair's lowest since he led his Labor Party to power in 1997 with a landslide victory after 18 years in opposition, promising renewal and an era of social reform. He had already announced that Thursday's election would be his last, and the result may speed his transfer of power to his heir apparent, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
        <p>With final results announced from nearly all of Britain's 646 voting districts by 5 a.m. (midnight Eastern time), Mr. Blair's majority was projected to have drastically fallen from around 160 in the departing Parliament to around 66. The Conservatives under Michael Howard rose to around 200 seats, while the smaller Liberal Democrats were projected to secure almost 60.</p>
        <p>As results poured in, Mr. Howard conceded defeat, saying, ''It looks as if Mr. Blair is going to win a third term for Labor.'' But, he said of his party, the result ''marks a significant step towards our recovery.'' The Conservatives have now lost a third straight election, but the results early Friday reversed a trend toward ever more disastrous defeats.</p>
        <p>Labor depicted the victory as historic, the first time since the party was formed in 1900 that it had secured a third successive term. The same feat, for the Conservative Party, was last recorded by Margaret Thatcher before she stepped down in 1990 toward the end of an era when the Conservatives had projected themselves as the party of government for much of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>But the Labor victory was bittersweet, coming after a campaign in which Mr. Blair has been bruised by criticism over the war, shunned by some traditional followers as untrustworthy and denied a repetition of landslide victories in 1997 and 2001.</p>
        <p>Speaking after he was re-elected with a big majority as a legislator for his home district in northeastern England, Mr. Blair said that if the early trends were confirmed, ''it seems as if it's clear that the British people wanted the return of the Labor Party with a reduced majority,'' and that Labor would have to respond to that sentiment.</p>
        <p>''We have to focus on the things that matter to them,'' he said. He also acknowledged the damage from the war in Iraq. ''Iraq has been a divisive issue in this country, but I hope now that we can unite again and look to the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Later, in a brief but confident and almost passionate address early Friday, Mr. Blair told supporters, ''We set out an agenda for change and we are now going to take that forward.'' He said he wanted to focus on ''the economy, jobs, living standards, our National Health Service, our schools, to give our young people the chance they need, law and order.''</p>
        <p>''To be elected for a third term is very special. It's a tremendous privilege, an honor, and we should use it for the benefit of our country.''</p>
        <p>He made no reference to handing over power to Mr. Brown. But Mr. Blair's margin -- neither overwhelmingly wide nor perilously narrow -- seemed likely to hasten the transfer of party leadership to his friend-turned-rival, Mr. Brown, who rallied to his defense during the campaign.</p>
        <p>The reduced majority could make it more difficult for Mr. Blair to push through legislative reforms in Parliament if rebels within his own party chose to challenge them. He campaigned on Labor's economic record and the investment it has made in health and education. But he has said he wants to make further changes in his third term, seeking an enduring legacy from an era in which he dominated the political landscape with a vast expansion of public services and a pugnacious foreign policy, sending troops to the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
        <p>But it was the war in Iraq -- when critics depicted Mr. Blair as a puppet of America -- that damaged him the most, deepening the voters' mistrust. In the final days of the campaign, the death of a British soldier in southern Iraq and disclosures about the ambiguous legal advice Mr. Blair received before the invasion rekindled accusations by his adversaries that he had sent troops to a distant battle-ground on false pretenses.</p>
        <p>Many long-time Labor supporters said it was only Mr. Brown's last-minute support that shielded the prime minister from even sharper criticism. That perception may strengthen Mr. Brown's claim on the leadership.</p>
        <p>''Tony Blair came into this election full of bright hope for a third term, keen to sell a renewed domestic vision to a country that he thought had had enough of old arguments about foreign affairs, keen to renew himself,'' Jackie Ashley wrote Thursday in a column in the pro-Labor Guardian. ''It hasn't worked out like that. He has been defensive, a fatally wounded leader. Instead of protecting the party, the party has protected him, at serious cost to itself. Anyone who now suggests Labor's victory can be seen as a personal victory for Blair is a sad fantasist.''</p>
        <p>''The question is not whether he gives way to Brown, but when,'' Ms. Ashley said.</p>
        <p>For all that, the campaign produced a remarkable shift in Mr. Blair's personal imagery. For much of his eight years in power, he has been accused of behaving in a presidential manner, projecting himself to center stage as his party's greatest electoral asset. In this campaign he has rarely been seen without Mr. Brown or another Labor Party heavyweight at his side.</p>
        <p>Some have called Mr. Brown his ''human shield,'' deflecting Labor supporters' criticisms of Mr. Blair's decision to enter the war as the closest ally of President Bush.</p>
        <p>That, in turn, has highlighted the different styles and personalities of the dour and sometimes brooding Mr. Brown and the more charismatic Mr. Blair. As they have appeared together, in theaters and town halls, Mr. Blair has presented himself in shirt-sleeves, delivering his message in unscripted speeches. Seeming less at ease and more formal, Mr. Brown kept on his suit-jacket and toted thick files of data to mine for arguments reinforcing the Labor cause.</p>
        <p>Equally, though, victory for Labor means a crushing, third defeat for the Conservatives, presaging what is likely to be a period of introspection and upheaval within Conservative ranks.</p>
        <p>The Tory leader, Mr. Howard, fought the ballot on a narrowly focused -- and, his critics said, negative -- campaign, appealing to British fears on such basic issues as immigration, crime and health care.</p>
        <p>But the campaign, choreographed by a reclusive Australian strategist called Lynton Crosby, did not resolve the conflict within the Conservatives between their traditional commitment to low taxes and small government, and newer promises by Mr. Howard to maintain high levels of public spending.</p>
        <p>It seemed, too, that Mr. Howard had been unable to completely erase voters' memories of his personal unpopularity and the voters' stunning rejection of the Conservatives as a whole before Mr. Blair came to power. Indeed, Mr. Howard has been dogged by his own past.</p>
        <p>In a front-page mock-up, The Daily Mirror depicted Mr. Howard on Thursday as Dracula an apparent reference to his origins as the son of a Romanian immigrant father, and an evocation of an adversary's remark that there was ''something of the night'' about him.</p>
        <p>The challenge facing Mr. Howard was to break out of the loyalist Conservative heartland, sometimes nicknamed a gilded cage, which is composed of about one-third of voters. But he courted accusations by his foes that he had merely rekindled his own and his party's unpopularity before the 1997 election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howard was accused, even by some Conservatives, of running a perilously negative campaign, assailing Mr. Blair as a liar over the Iraq war while focusing on five points: cleaner hospitals, school discipline, lower taxes, controlled immigration and more effective policing.</p>
        <p>Anatole Kaletsky, a columnist in The Times of London, wrote Thursday that by ''reminding many voters of why they hated the Tories, even in Margaret Thatcher's heyday, Mr. Howard seems to have paved the way for another Labor triumph.''</p>
        <p>The Conservatives' campaign ''put back the day when the Tories could re-emerge as a plausible alternative government or, at least, a serious opposition,'' Mr. Kaletsky said.</p>
        <p>But in the erosion of Labor, there may also have been a sense among voters of malaise after years of the same rulers. Some said it was time for someone different.</p>
        <p>''Eight years is long enough; it's time we had a little change,'' John Hall, 70, a retired researcher, said as he browsed in a charity shop in Finchley, in North London.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Miriam Hollington, manager of a bookstore in Finchley, said: ''Gordon Brown? That's far more positive than Blair.''</p>
        <p>''There seems to be a bit more of the Old Labor in Brown than in Blair,'' she said, using the political shorthand for more traditional and less market-driven Labor policies.</p>
        <p>But some saw problems ahead for the solemn-looking Mr. Brown, even if he does take over. ''Gordon Brown is going to be very dour,'' said Philip Horesh, an accountant. ''He has to change to be successful at the next election.''</p>
