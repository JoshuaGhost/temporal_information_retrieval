        <p>Tracy McGrady was not going home. McGrady had found himself eliminated in the first round of the playoffs four times in his career. Facing that fate Thursday night, he took his unearthly talents and carried the Houston Rockets to another day -- Game 7 Saturday in Dallas.</p>
        <p>McGrady, who scored a series-high 37 points, was not the only Rocket unwilling to go home. The 38-year-old backup center, Dikembe Mutombo, 13 years older than McGrady, blocked 4 shots and grabbed 5 rebounds in the fourth quarter as the Rockets went on a 19-0 run to crush the Mavericks, 101-83.</p>

        <p>Tracy McGrady was not going home. McGrady had found himself eliminated in the first round of the playoffs four times in his career. Facing that fate Thursday night, he took his unearthly talents and carried the Houston Rockets to another day -- Game 7 Saturday in Dallas.</p>
        <p>McGrady, who scored a series-high 37 points, was not the only Rocket unwilling to go home. The 38-year-old backup center, Dikembe Mutombo, 13 years older than McGrady, blocked 4 shots and grabbed 5 rebounds in the fourth quarter as the Rockets went on a 19-0 run to crush the Mavericks, 101-83.</p>
        <p>''This is what you play for,'' McGrady, who was 14 of 28 from the field, said of Game 7. ''This has already been a great series.''</p>
        <p>This first-round series has had drama, controversy and unpredictability since it started with two Houston victories in Dallas.</p>
        <p>As Yao Ming, the center in the storm of controversy caused by his coach, Jeff Van Gundy, sat on the bench after a dismal third quarter, the Houston bench players took over. Jon Barry scored 12 fourth-quarter points, and the backup point guard Mike James finished with 22 points.</p>
        <p>After the game, Dallas Coach Avery Johnson lashed out Van Gundy's gamesmanship.</p>
        <p>''We don't make excuses, we lost the game,'' Johnson said. ''The game was called fairly, pretty much, and that's the way it is. All I'm saying is this -- this is a great series. If you win, take your medicine. If you lose, take whatever it is.''</p>
        <p>In Game 6 the local hero did not turn out to be Van Gundy, whose claims of prejudicial officiating had rocked the N.B.A. earlier this week. Instead, McGrady, the 6-foot-8 star, turned it into his show.</p>
        <p>The Rockets were leading by only 82-80 with 8 minutes 35 seconds to play when they put the game away, payback for Dallas's 20-0 run that iced Game 3. Dallas would not score again until the final minute of the game, missing 17 consecutive shots.</p>
        <p>The Mavericks took a 70-69 lead into the fourth quarter, gaining momentum when Yao seemed to lose his. With the Rockets leading, 68-62, in the third quarter, Yao committed 2 turnovers, missed 2 free throws and a blew a layup. He finished with only 8 points.</p>
        <p>After the first quarter, this game belonged to Houston. The Rockets outscored the Mavs, 34-19, in the second quarter to take a 52-47 lead into the locker room at halftime.</p>
        <p>McGrady had 19 first-half points, 10 coming in the final 2:48. He capped his personal run with a 4-point play when he hit a 3-pointer and drew a foul from Michael Finley.</p>
        <p>It was clear McGrady had decided to take over the game, so driven was he to make history for himself. Even if he had not talked much this week to his teammates about that desire to advance to the second round, they all knew.</p>
        <p>''Our players derive a lot of confidence, intensity when they see that will to win,'' Van Gundy said Wednesday of McGrady. ''That will to win isn't anything you can talk about. It doesn't matter how he's shooting, his shot maybe comes and goes. All that matters, is that will.''</p>
        <p>After missing his first four shots in the second quarter, McGrady worked to distribute the ball to his teammates. After falling behind by 10 points at the start of the quarter and then by 28-22, James ignited the Rockets' surge. He scored 8 straight points for Houston, two baskets coming off his own steals to tie the score at 30-30.</p>
        <p>After Jerry Stackhouse kept pace for the Mavericks, giving them a 35-30 lead, McGrady started involving the unheralded offensive player Ryan Bowen, feeding him twice to give the Rockets a 42-39 lead.</p>
        <p>McGrady took over from there, changing the momentum, in hopes of changing the Rockets' fortunes.</p>
        <p>The teams showed their distaste for, or maybe just their weariness of, one another. Yao took a hard spill, courtesy of a hard foul by Josh Howard. His eyes were glaring, his ears steaming as he got up and headed in Howard's direction. McGrady grabbed him, almost with a smile, to see his normally restrained 7-foot-6 center showing such aggression.</p>
        <p>In the third quarter, Rockets point guard Bob Sura was hit with a technical foul when he grabbed Howard from behind in an attempt to stop his dribble, perhaps in a show of defense of his teammate.</p>
        <p>The first quarter had been the indicator in each of the previous five games in this series, the team leading at the end of the first 12 minutes winning the game.</p>
        <p>Stackhouse, who led the Mavericks with 21 points, started a 9-1 run to end the first quarter with a 3-pointer and hit two more jumpers. He was not finished, making his first six shots. David Wesley was helpless to defend him.</p>
        <p>Stackhouse, in his first year with Dallas, has been his team's third-leading scorer, with 13.4 points in 29 minutes per game off the bench, shooting 50 percent beyond the 3-point arc.</p>
        <p>It was not a coincidence that the Mavericks started surging when their reserve forward, Keith Van Horn, sprained his ankle in the first half of Game 3. Stackhouse has been averaging 10 more minutes on the court because Van Horn was unable to return.</p>
        <p>''The Van Horn injury, I believe, was one of the keys in the series, that influenced their decision to play small,'' Van Gundy said. ''We knew at the moment it happened that it was not good for us.''</p>
