        <p>Insurgents staged a series of attacks across Baghdad on Thursday, including a suicide attack in which the bomber blew himself up in a crowd of job applicants outside an Iraqi Army base. At least 22 people were killed, officials said.</p>
        <p>The attacks were the latest in a series of bombings that began a week ago with the announcement of Iraq's new cabinet. The new Shiite-led government is still negotiating with Sunni Arabs over unfilled cabinet posts a week after it was formally sworn in, and insurgents have seized on the indecision to mount increasingly deadly attacks.</p>

        <p>Insurgents staged a series of attacks across Baghdad on Thursday, including a suicide attack in which the bomber blew himself up in a crowd of job applicants outside an Iraqi Army base. At least 22 people were killed, officials said.</p>
        <p>The attacks were the latest in a series of bombings that began a week ago with the announcement of Iraq's new cabinet. The new Shiite-led government is still negotiating with Sunni Arabs over unfilled cabinet posts a week after it was formally sworn in, and insurgents have seized on the indecision to mount increasingly deadly attacks.</p>
        <p>At 7:30 a.m., a man with grenades strapped to his body walked into crowd of about 40 job applicants in front of a large Iraqi Army base in central Baghdad. A soldier spotted the man and tried to shoot him, but the safety stuck on his gun and the man was able to blow himself up, according to Lt. Ahmed Mustafa, an Iraqi officer at the base who saw the incident.</p>
        <p>In all, the blast at the base killed at least 13 people, an Interior Ministry official said. Among them was the soldier who tried to stop the bomber, Lieutenant Mustafa said, adding that it was the seventh such attack on the base, the main location for army recruiting in the city.</p>
        <p>''We are used to it,'' he said, standing at the site of the explosion, a concrete corridor between the base and a busy highway. By the afternoon, soldiers had sprinkled sand over puddles of blood. Strips of clothing and debris covered the branches of a tree near the site. A string of orange plastic prayer beads hung from a hook on a safety barrier nearby. A shoe lay on the concrete.</p>
        <p>The bomber looked to be in his late teens or early 20's, Lieutenant Mustafa said. He said he knew that because soldiers had found the bomber's head intact.</p>
        <p>The attack on Thursday was similar to a strike carried out the day before outside a police station in the northern city of Erbil, where 60 people were killed. Iraqi Army soldiers are considered traitors by the insurgents, and frequently are targets in bomb attacks.</p>
        <p>In the city of Mosul, also in the north, a car bomb killed four policemen, according to Iraqi police sources cited by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Political wrangling continued on Thursday, with Shiite and Sunni leaders debating over candidates for the post of defense minister. Sunni Arabs have complained that the Shiites have blocked their nominees, while Shiites say they will not accept anyone who had been a member of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Laith Kubba, a senior aide to Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, said the Sunnis had put forward two candidates for the post, and that once a third is agreed upon, Mr. Jaafari will then pick a minister from that list of three.</p>
        <p>Iraqi political leaders have repeatedly said they were on the verge of agreeing on a candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kubba added that the other vacant ministry posts appeared now to be settled. Some Shiite political leaders have said for several days that the new oil minister will be Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum, the son of a prominent Shiite cleric.</p>
        <p>In other violence on Thursday, eight police officers were killed in an ambush in southwest Baghdad. In the two-pronged attack, masked gunmen in several cars, one with a machine gun mounted on it, drove up to a checkpoint in southwest Baghdad, shot at policemen in a car and threw an explosive at another, said Isaa Bahedh, a policeman at a station nearby.</p>
        <p>The men then drove to another checkpoint where they killed several more policemen. After the killings, a gunman took the officers' guns and badges, and fired bullets into the heads of several of them, even though they were already dead, said Nabil Hashim, a 21-year-old driver who saw the shooting from a garage nearby.</p>
        <p>One of the officers killed, Ayad Baro, 23, was just 20 days from his wedding, said his uncle, who identified himself as Abu Amen. The body lay under a light blue sheet on a gurney outside a crowded morgue at Yarmouk Hospital.</p>
        <p>''I'm losing my brother's son and I blame everybody,'' said Abu Amen, his face a mask of sadness, as relatives brought in a coffin.</p>
        <p>Despite the attacks, Iraqis are still willing to sign up for work in this country's security forces. A soldier who was injured in a suicide bomb attack in the Doura area on Wednesday night, Kamel Khamza, 35, said from his hospital bed that he would return to work.</p>
        <p>''Our country is in a difficult time, but we have to serve to protect our families,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In another attack, a car bomb exploded near the home of an Interior Ministry official, killing a police officer and wounding six, an Interior Ministry official said.</p>
        <p>Also on Thursday, Bulgaria, an American ally in Iraq, moved closer to bringing its troops home. Bulgaria's Parliament approved a government plan to reduce its 450-troop deployment next month and withdraw the force completely by the end of next year, Reuters reported.</p>

        <p>Berlusconi Addresses Parliament  By The New York Times</p>
        <p>ROME, May 5 -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told the Italian Parliament on Thursday that American soldiers could not be excused from responsibility for the shooting death of an Italian intelligence agent in Baghdad in March, but he said the incident and the still simmering disagreement over culpability for it would not force him to withdraw the 3,000 Italian troops from Iraq.</p>
        <p>The shooting has strained relations between Italy and the United States. On Wednesday, Mr. Bush called Mr. Berlusconi to again express his condolences for the death of the agent, Nicola Calipari, who was killed by an American soldier at a roadblock in Baghdad on March 4 after Mr. Calipari had secured the release of an Italian journalist from the hands of kidnappers.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Italy released a report disputing earlier United States findings that the American soldiers were not to blame.</p>
        <p>''The absence of intention does not rule out responsibility,'' Mr. Berlusconi told Parliament, but added, ''We have no intention of establishing any connection between the assessment of this case in which our official lost his life and the role of our country in Iraq.''</p>
