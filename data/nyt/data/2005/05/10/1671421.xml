        <p>Net profit for the Japanese unit of the McDonald's Corporation more than tripled, to 1.92 billion yen ($18.23 million), for the quarter that ended March 31, from 560 million yen in the same quarter a year earlier, as it increased sales in new and existing restaurants. The Japanese unit, McDonald's Holdings (Japan) said revenue rose 8.8 percent, to 82.14 billion yen, for the quarter, helped in part by a simplified pricing system and new breakfast menu items. The McDonald's Corporation of the United States owns 50 percent of the Japanese unit, which is the biggest fast-food chain in the nation. The unit kept its full-year profit forecast unchanged at 5.17 billion yen.</p>
