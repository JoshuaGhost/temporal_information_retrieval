        <p>How Manu Ginóbili suffers. With all he has to endure  elbows that snap back his head and hard body checks that grind him into the court -- it is a wonder that the San Antonio Spurs guard can take all the punishment.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder to SuperSonics guard Ray Allen. From one actor to another, Allen can only admire Ginóbili's theatrical style of play.</p>
        <p>''He's fooling the refs, so I got to say it's a 10 out of 10,'' said Allen, rating Ginóbili's acting ability when he encounters contact. ''But you know when I think about it, I'd have to say it's about a 7. His head's always flopping back. That doesn't convince me. But he still gets the call.''</p>
        <p>It is all in that hair, long black strands that spread across his face when he is bumped. He looks like a wounded sheepdog.</p>
        <p>''What he does, when someone bodies him or puts an arm on his head, his head always flops,'' Allen said. ''So then his hair goes wild, and it looks like someone just murdered him. Those fouls aren't that hard.''</p>
        <p>This is not to say that Allen is belittling Ginóbili's ability. He would not do that, not after Ginóbili's effort in their second-round Western Conference playoff series helped the Spurs defeat the Sonics, four games to two.</p>
        <p>Ginóbili averaged 20.5 points in the series, including a 39-point effort in the Spurs' 103-90 victory in Game 5. Then Thursday, in the final seconds of Game 6, Ginóbili broke down the Sonics' defense with a drive into the lane. He fed the ball to center Tim Duncan, who put it in off the glass with a half-second left for the clinching 98-96 victory. The Spurs will face the winner of the Dallas-Phoenix series in the conference final.</p>
        <p>Allen acknowledges Ginóbili's contributions and grudgingly appreciates how he has fallen in line with some of the game's most accomplished floppers.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-6 Ginóbili, who has gone to the free-throw line 109 times in the playoffs, second only to Phoenix's Amare Stoudemire (125), is aware of the flopping accusations.</p>
        <p>''I know they say that,'' he said. ''But I am 200 pounds. When I go full speed against a 300-pound guy, like Danny Fortson or Jerome James, they are pretty big dudes. So there is not much room to flop in there, especially when you are up in the air.</p>
        <p>''I don't penetrate thinking about how I am going to exaggerate. I am trying to finish.''</p>
        <p>Then in a slight bow to his detractors, he admitted, ''Anyways, I don't think that exaggerating, if I am fouled, is bad.''</p>
        <p>However, when it really mattered Thursday, there was no flopping. Ginóbili knew that, with the score tied at 96-96 and 14.4 seconds left, he was not going to get any help from the referees. During a timeout, San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich placed his trust in Ginóbili to make the winning decision.</p>
        <p>Ginóbili, guarded by Antonio Daniels, held the ball near midcourt as he watched the clock wind down. With just under six seconds remaining, Ginóbili drove on Daniels and into the lane. ''We wanted Manu to just create off it,'' Popovich said.</p>
        <p>The Spurs stationed Robert Horry at the top of the key and Duncan on the baseline and let Ginóbili go.</p>
        <p>''Manu did just a great job in decision-making,'' Popovich said. ''We left it up to him. He made a super decision.''</p>
        <p>Ginóbili, dashing past Daniels, drew Sonics forward Vitaly Potapenko away from Duncan. ''My main concern was to finish, then I saw Potapenko come to help,'' Ginóbili said. ''If you have your best player open, you try to find him.''</p>
        <p>Duncan, who was 5 for 20 from the field at that point after making just 1 of 13 shots through three quarters, was unfettered as he finished with his touch off the glass.</p>
        <p>''Manu made a great move to the basket,'' Sonics Coach Nate McMillan said. ''We were in the help position, and he just threaded the needle with that pass, getting it by Vitaly's arm.''</p>
        <p>Ginóbili had taken everyone in one final time.</p>
