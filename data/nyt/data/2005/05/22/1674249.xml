        <p>For some time now, entertainment observers have been breathlessly venturing that there might at long last be another regime change in the JAMES BOND franchise. DAME JUDI DENCH, who has played the super spy's boss, ''M,'' has thrown in her two pence, maintaining that PIERCE BROSNAN will continue on in the role. The smoothly ingratiating Irish actor has played Bond since 1995 and while he has acquitted himself gracefully playing Her Majesty's most suave agent, he is no SEAN CONNERY. But then, who is?</p>
        <p>That is the question you can ponder this evening if you head over to the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART where, as part of its 112 Years of Cinema program, you can thrill to Sean Connery in his first outing as Bond in ''DR. NO.'' (In the same movie, you can also thrill to a bikini-clad URSULA ANDRESS rising from the ocean deep, armed and very dangerous.) Directed by TERENCE YOUNG, this 1962 film is leaner and far meaner than almost any subsequent Bond film; certainly, Mr. Connery had yet to smooth down his appealing rough-trade edges. Today at 2 p.m., Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212)708-9480.</p>
        <p>QUINCY JONES once compared the Scotsman to a panther and watching Mr. Connery slink his way through both villains and women in ''Dr. No'' you understand why. Along with the second film in the franchise, ''TO RUSSIA WITH LOVE'' (1963), also directed by Terence Young and available on DVD, ''Dr. No'' represents Bond at his finest.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in throwing in your two American cents about who should take on the role next, a good place to start is the entertaining new British gangster flick, ''LAYER CAKE,'' which stars the charismatic DANIEL CRAIG as a drug dealer looking for the nearest exit. Mr. Craig may not move like a panther, but he has enough of the right stuff to make him a contender.</p>
