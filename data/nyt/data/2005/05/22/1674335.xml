        <p>POUGHKEEPSIE is best known as an old, working-class Hudson River town that time and stagnation have left in disrepair and disrepute. But these days it is also home to Huma Bhabha and Jason Fox, a successful New York artist couple who were looking to escape the punishing cycle of ever-rising rents on their Manhattan studios and a depressing tenement apartment.</p>
        <p>New York artists have been migrating to leafier surroundings for more than half a century; Jackson Pollock moved to the East End of Long Island in 1945, and Richard Prince moved to an abandoned ranch-style building on 80 acres in Rensselaerville, N.Y., near Albany, in 2001. But moves like that of Ms. Bhabha and Mr. Fox -- to towns not particularly recognized as havens for artists -- are the latest wrinkle in this exodus. And they are far from alone in taking shelter in an unlikely place.</p>

        <p>POUGHKEEPSIE is best known as an old, working-class Hudson River town that time and stagnation have left in disrepair and disrepute. But these days it is also home to Huma Bhabha and Jason Fox, a successful New York artist couple who were looking to escape the punishing cycle of ever-rising rents on their Manhattan studios and a depressing tenement apartment.</p>
        <p>New York artists have been migrating to leafier surroundings for more than half a century; Jackson Pollock moved to the East End of Long Island in 1945, and Richard Prince moved to an abandoned ranch-style building on 80 acres in Rensselaerville, N.Y., near Albany, in 2001. But moves like that of Ms. Bhabha and Mr. Fox -- to towns not particularly recognized as havens for artists -- are the latest wrinkle in this exodus. And they are far from alone in taking shelter in an unlikely place.</p>
        <p>Timely evidence of this development may be found in ''Greater New York 2005,'' the survey of more than 150 emerging artists from the greater New York area now on exhibit at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City. Some live in the recognized artists' outposts of the last decade, like Peekskill and Beacon, N.Y., or Jersey City. But others have chosen an unexpected town or area -- like Poughkeepsie, Guilford, Conn., Asbury Park, N.J., and the North Fork of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Artists make the move in search of space for studios and living -- so expensive and rare in New York City. Although many find they miss the cultural stimulation of the big city, they also discover, in some cases to their surprise, that they can concentrate on their work more intensely in calmer surroundings. Some even find new inspiration.</p>
        <p>What follows is a profile of a group of young and emerging artists who have moved to unlikely regional towns. Some are included in ''Greater New York,'' while others are represented by recognized city galleries and have blossoming careers. But all have shifted their creative center of gravity away from the city.</p>
        <p>Poughkeepsie</p>
        <p>''My work has definitely gone in a good direction since we came here,'' said Ms. Bhabha, a 42-year-old sculptor. ''I have just got a gallery in New York to represent me, had my first show with them, and have been showing more in the last year or so than ever before.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bhabha was sitting in a spacious studio off the living room of her third-floor loft-style apartment in a converted department store, with sunny windows looking over buildings and a parking lot. Here she makes her figurative mixed-media sculptures, some of which are featured in ''Greater New York.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bhabha came here two years ago with Mr. Fox after a New York landlord threatened to triple the rent on their TriBeCa studios. They were drawn initially by the town's abundance of industrial buildings for rent, many at affordable prices, but have since come to appreciate its character and charm.</p>
        <p>''When we first came here I used to joke that we had gone into the witness protection program or something, because we were living in this strange, quiet place where we didn't know anyone,'' Mr. Fox said. ''But it worked out O.K., as there aren't so many distractions and you can concentrate more on what you are doing.''</p>
        <p>Since 1991, Mr. Fox, 40, has shown his figurative paintings at Feature Inc. in New York City. His work is also included in ''Greater New York.''</p>
        <p>The couple return to the city regularly, mostly for socializing, but are always glad to go back to Poughkeepsie.</p>
        <p>''New York is so competitive for artists, and you feel like you are always in a race,'' Mr. Fox said. ''You are very aware of it down there, but up here we can sort of decompress. Even though it is not that far away, it feels sort of far away mentally.''</p>
        <p>Norwalk, Conn.</p>
        <p>''Right now I am really interested in artists who have studios outside of New York,'' said the sculptor Joe Fig, who two years ago moved to Norwalk, a quiet town with a curious mix of old industrial areas, a nascent downtown arts district, and, heading toward New Canaan, elegant homes, stone walls, rivers and woods. ''Given I no longer live in the city, I am curious to see how they work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fig moved to Norwalk in search of peace, quiet and studio space. And if any artist deserves a studio, it is Mr. Fig, 37, who makes exact, intricate, three-dimensional sculptural models of famous artists' studios. Past subjects include the studios of Chuck Close, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. He has also done the studios of contemporary artists like Fred Tomaselli.</p>
        <p>The idea for these sculptures came to Mr. Fig in the late 1990's, when he was living in Brooklyn, and working in a back area of his living room. He said he envied artists with big, light-filled studios, so he began making models as a kind of comment on his own lack of space. Dealers and curators loved them, and his art career was made.</p>
        <p>With money from the sale of his sculptures, Mr. Fig bought a rickety 1939 Cape Cod home on one and a half leafy acres in Norwalk. He turned the two-car garage into a studio, putting down a plywood floor and drywall and insulation for the walls and ceiling, and finally installing a heater. When the weather is nice, he opens up the double garage doors to let air and sunshine in.</p>
        <p>Right now he is building a model of the studios belonging to the well-known painting couple Eric Fischl and April Gornik, who recently moved to North Haven on the South Fork of Long Island, where they have built a home and dual studios perpendicular to each other.</p>
        <p>''They are among the most beautiful studios that I've ever seen,'' Mr. Fig said.</p>
        <p>Aside from regular exhibitions at his New York gallery, Plus Ultra in Brooklyn, Mr. Fig had a show this past year in Boston, another in Santa Monica, Calif., and another at the Bass Museum of Art in Miami Beach. He is also working with Swiss collectors on a collaborative commission with the Russian artists Ilya and Emilia Kabakov.</p>
        <p>The North Fork</p>
        <p>For some artists, leaving New York City is all about access to cut-rate studios. But for others, like Michael Combs, it is also about setting up shop in an alternative environment as a source of creative nourishment.</p>
        <p>Raised in Southold, on the North Fork of Long Island, Mr. Combs, 34, comes from a long line of local boat builders, duck hunters and decoy makers. His works are a spin on that heritage, consisting of intricately carved wooden objects with social and environmental messages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs, who was born in Huntington, on Long Island, had often thought about returning to the Island during a decade in the city. But he did not make the move until late 2001, when he was offered a studio in Southold, the entire second floor of an old carriage barn owned by a friend. He rents a house in nearby Greenport, where he lives with his wife and young son.</p>
        <p>He was drawn to the area, he said, ''by the natural beauty of the location and degree of serenity and solitude that living out here affords.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs still keeps a loft in Manhattan. But his creative center is on the North Fork, he said, where he now makes his sculptures in a light, airy space measuring 30 feet by 30 feet, several times the size of his former city studio.</p>
        <p>''Just being here I feel alive, energetic and anchored to my roots,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also finds that being on the North Fork is conducive to work.</p>
        <p>''I was very much surprised when I first started working here how much I could get done,'' he said. ''It also helped me appreciate the city more, using it for what it offers, like the cultural scene, then heading back up here. It is a nice balance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs exhibits locally and in the city. Recently, he had a major installation at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, and has an exhibition later that closes June 5 at the Icehouse Gallery in Greenport. He also had work in an exhibition at Exit Art in Manhattan earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Asbury Park, N.J.</p>
        <p>To many people, Asbury Park is a crumbling shore town where Bruce Springsteen had his start. But these days it is also home to Robert Melee, a well-known artist who made a significant sum from a sale of his artwork to the British collector Charles Saatchi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melee, 38, took his money and, in 2000, bought a run-down house in Asbury Park and converted it into a boutique studio-home, designing the renovation himself. He said the house was so cheap that he charged the down payment on a credit card. He now has two bedrooms, a large living room, a studio and a shady garden near the beach, 58 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Raised nearby in Sayreville, Mr. Melee is widely known for his attention-grabbing videos of his mother. But he also makes beautiful Op Art bottle-top paintings as well as furniture-like sculptural units (which is what Mr. Saatchi bought) decorated with family photographs, videocassettes and television monitors.</p>
        <p>His work is featured in ''Greater New York,'' and he has exhibited recently at the New Museum and Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York, as well as the Milwaukee Art Museum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melee returned to his home state after 17 years in New York City, he said, because he was tired of having no space.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I sacrificed so much for so long living in the city, and it was only after I made the decision to move down here that I realized that I could have contact with the cultural scene there but also have the kind of home and work space I had always wanted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has also experienced an uptick in his outlook since moving to Asbury Park, he said.</p>
        <p>''My new home-studio space has really inspired me,'' he said. ''I feel incredibly content here, which I think has come partly from having no social distractions and partly from being able to take more than three steps in any direction without hitting a piece of furniture. Having that contentment makes you feel grounded and centered, which in turn feeds creativity.''</p>
