        <p>NOBODY ever said the creative process is painless. But the dancers of Chunky Move, an Australian troupe known for its muscular style, have taken it on the chin. Working conditions got so tough during rehearsals for ''Tense Dave,'' a haunting character study poised for a six-week American tour, that cast members experienced headaches, dizzy spells and bouts of nausea.</p>
        <p>''They looked quite green sometimes,'' recalled Lucy Guerin, a choreographer who collaborated on the production. ''But they kept at it long enough to adjust.''</p>
        <p>The source of the dancers' discomfort was right beneath their feet. The hourlong ''Tense Dave,'' which chronicles one man's close encounters with the creeps next door, takes place on a continuously revolving stage, known in theater parlance as a revolve.</p>
        <p>Revolves are rare in dance, where they pose numerous technical challenges. In rehearsals for ''Tense Dave,'' cast members recalled, sets rolled off the stage, dancers stumbled into walls, and a velvet gown snagged in the wheels underneath. Even when things stayed pretty much where they were supposed to be, there were those queasy stomachs. But with time, the dancers' bodies became acclimated to the unfamiliar forces at play.</p>
        <p>Gideon Obarzanek, the troupe's founder and artistic director, describes ''Tense Dave'' as a darkly humorous portrait, with each of five characters expressing a different side of a single personality.</p>
        <p>Initially, the circular stage is split into five wedge-shaped rooms, and Dave emerges from one and bumps into his deranged neighbors. As his world spins out of control, the walls dividing the stage come down in a fantasia that recalls the psychological inquiries of Pina Bausch and the kaleidoscopic spectacles of Busby Berkeley.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to do a work where the main character quickly finds himself involved, beyond his capacity, with other characters,'' Mr. Obarzanek said by telephone from the home he shares with Ms. Guerin in Melbourne. ''Dave embodies the tension between the need to connect with others and the dread that these connections will rapidly develop into overwhelming responsibilities or unreasonable expectations.''</p>
        <p>''Tense Dave'' runs for three weeks at Dance Theater Workshop beginning on Wednesday, then travels to the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. Since its premiere in Melbourne, in October 2003, it has toured to three other cities in Australia and to Portland, Ore., all without incident. Dancing on a moving surface now comes as easily as riding a bike, said Kristy Ayre, one of the performers. Yet Mr. Obarzanek still finds it nerve-racking to watch, he said, ''given the array of things that can go wrong.''</p>
        <p>Joining Mr. Obarzanek and Ms. Guerin, who had made two other dances for Chunky Move, was Michael Kantor, the artistic director of an acting troupe in Melbourne that develops new plays. For early rehearsals, they rented a revolving platform used in car showrooms. Later they had one built to order.</p>
        <p>Roughly 18 feet in diameter, it stands a foot off the ground and weighs nearly a ton. Its speed varies in the course of the show, up to eight revolutions per minute.</p>
        <p>The opening scene presents five figures alone in their tiny chambers: a suicidal woman, a domineering auteur, a delusional romantic, a dangerous hooligan and Dave, who bears the brunt of their fears and fantasies. As the stage turns, they are visible only intermittently, but they never stop performing.</p>
        <p>''I do lots of things around the back of the stage that are not seen by the audience,'' Ms. Ayre said. ''But we timed it so the most poignant moments coincide with when I'm facing the front.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guerin created the longer dance sequences on solid ground, then transferred them to the revolve. But finding the right perspective was tedious, given the ever-changing frame of reference. ''With theater and dance, the angle from which you view something is crucial,'' Ms. Guerin said. ''One angle will tell you everything. Another tells you nothing.''</p>
        <p>She turned that principle to her advantage in one unexpectedly tender scene, a duet for Michelle Heaven (the suicidal one) and Brian Lucas (Dave), in which they forge a palpable bond from opposite sides of a wall panel. The panel often obscures one figure or the other, but periodically, with further revolutions, the connections between them become clear.</p>
        <p>The revolve allows for a degree of fluidity normally associated with film. ''With straight-on theater, you need a blackout'' to change sets, Ms. Guerin said. ''Here you can cut to another scene without going through that fuss and rigamarole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obarzanek relishes these cinematic qualities, too, describing the dance with terms like close-up, pan and dissolve. He is especially taken by the ease of making transitions. ''While one thing is finishing or receding,'' he said, ''another becomes more prominent, like a wipe edit in film.''</p>
        <p>Originally, he conceived of ''Tense Dave'' as a few simultaneous narratives, like those in the site-specific works he had created at a nightclub and a vacant shopping arcade in Melbourne. But tour presenters urged him to create something that could travel. His solution was the circular, spinning stage divided by walls.</p>
        <p>He brought in Ms. Guerin and Mr. Kantor, who paired off with different dancers and improvised in tight spaces. But they scrapped the idea of juxtaposing separate pieces when a collective narrative emerged.</p>
        <p>''What grew out of all that was a central character -- we used to call him the beige man -- who didn't really have any characteristics or any particular personality,'' Ms. Guerin said. ''As he passes through the other characters' rooms, he becomes unwillingly embroiled in their stories, taking on leading roles in their conspiracies and fixations.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the spinning stage worked its way deeper into the narrative. ''The revolve transcends its function as a stage device and becomes a central theme,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''If only Dave could stop this world, maybe he could make more sense of it.''</p>
        <p>In rehearsal, the dancers often felt the same way. But Ms. Guerin, noting their resilience, savors the revolve's inexorable pull. ''You can't stop things,'' she said. ''You have to embrace what is coming next, the next thing that life is going to present you with.''</p>
