        <p>Caryn James Critic's Notebook column on recent and upcoming films dealing with psychologically traumatized veterans of the gulf war, Afghanistan and Iraq, including Danish film Brothers and Harsh Times, starring Christian Bale as Army Ranger who returns from Iraq and turns to crime; other recent projects discussed; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Every war inspires its emblematic screen heroes, from the stoic World War II veterans of ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946) to the paraplegic Vietnam veteran who gains a political conscience, played by Jon Voight in ''Coming Home'' (1978). Now, in a just completed film called ''Harsh Times,'' Christian Bale is a veteran for our time. He plays an Army Ranger who returns from Iraq so haunted by what he has done, so psychologically scarred, that he turns to criminal acts back home.</p>
        <p>The image of the psychologically traumatized veteran of recent conflicts -- on screen the gulf war, Afghanistan and Iraq all blend into one lingering desert war -- is bound to be familiar soon. An eye-opening example is in theaters now in the subtle, heartbreaking Danish film ''Brothers''; the television series ''Over There,'' beginning in July on F/X, takes an unflinching look at the effects of war on American soldiers in Iraq.</p>

        <p>Every war inspires its emblematic screen heroes, from the stoic World War II veterans of ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' (1946) to the paraplegic Vietnam veteran who gains a political conscience, played by Jon Voight in ''Coming Home'' (1978). Now, in a just completed film called ''Harsh Times,'' Christian Bale is a veteran for our time. He plays an Army Ranger who returns from Iraq so haunted by what he has done, so psychologically scarred, that he turns to criminal acts back home.</p>
        <p>The image of the psychologically traumatized veteran of recent conflicts -- on screen the gulf war, Afghanistan and Iraq all blend into one lingering desert war -- is bound to be familiar soon. An eye-opening example is in theaters now in the subtle, heartbreaking Danish film ''Brothers''; the television series ''Over There,'' beginning in July on F/X, takes an unflinching look at the effects of war on American soldiers in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Adrien Brody has already played a damaged veteran in the recent, unintentionally silly drama ''The Jacket'' (he was shot in the head during the gulf war and also learns to time travel), but there are more promising, high-profile projects in the works. ''Death and Dishonor,'' being developed at Warner Brothers for Paul Haggis (the co-writer and director of ''Crash'' and the writer of ''Million Dollar Baby'') is based on the true story of a group of Iraq veterans accused of murdering a member of their own battalion after returning to Georgia. The story captures the idea behind all these films: once a soldier has killed in war, it's not easy to step back into a peaceful civilian life.</p>
        <p>These works are determinedly apolitical, partly for practical reasons. With the war in Iraq still raging and the country polarized, few filmmakers want to alienate half the audience. And classic films like ''Best Years'' and ''Coming Home'' were made soon after those wars ended. The current works can't have historical distance, but they can see the impact of war on soldiers. They are inspired by veterans' problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, and they fit comfortably into a political landscape in which even vocal opponents of the war in Iraq, like Michael Moore and Tim Robbins, are careful to express support for the men and women fighting it.</p>
        <p>There was no need for World War II films to take a political stance, because the country was so united. In ''Best Years,'' the veterans were embraced by their families, as they were by the nation.</p>
        <p>And it was impossible for Vietnam movies to avoid politics. The two strongest films about that era, both from 1978, emphasize opposite images that are influential even now: one veteran comes to his senses, and the other loses his mind. In ''Coming Home,'' the Voight character, Luke, grows his hair long and protests the war. That politicized approach lives on in recent works like ''Embedded,'' Mr. Robbins's underappreciated play about soldiers and journalists in Iraq (a filmed version will be shown on the Sundance Channel later this year) and in David O. Russell's 1999 film ''Three Kings,'' about the gulf war, which argues that America's involvement is all about oil.</p>
        <p>But the new screen heroes are more directly descended from ''The Deer Hunter'' and its defining scene, in which the emotionally shattered soldier portrayed by Christopher Walken plays Russian roulette in Saigon. And in a more surprising turn, they also echo Bruce Dern's character in ''Coming Home.'' An anti-hero, a gung-ho military man, he is overshadowed by the movie's politicized hero. Yet it is the Dern character who reveals his distress in a moment of rare candor, telling his wife (played by Jane Fonda), ''My men were chopping heads off.'' He no longer feels that he belongs at home or at war; he points a gun at his wife and Luke when he learns that they have had an affair -- Luke says sympathetically, ''You don't want to kill anybody here; you have enough ghosts to carry around'' -- and he walks into the sea at the end.</p>
        <p>Such problems resonate with particular sharpness in ''Brothers,'' about a soldier, Michael, who leaves his wife and children to fight with the United Nations forces in Afghanistan, and his ne'er-do-well brother, Jannik, who stays home and tries to pull his life together. Before going into combat, Michael tells his men, ''If any of you doubt that we're doing the right thing, wait till we get there,'' but that hint at politics is quickly dropped.</p>
        <p>Soon Michael is believed to be dead, and Jannik becomes the emotional mainstay of his brother's family. But the audience knows that Michael has been taken prisoner, and that he commits horrors beyond what he imagined possible. When he returns, he is haunted by ghosts he is unable to talk about, and explodes in episodes of violence.</p>
        <p>''Brothers'' is so emotionally eloquent that it makes no difference that its characters are Danish or that the combat setting is Afghanistan. And because the civilian brother's struggles are as movingly portrayed as the soldier's, it is a poignant film rather than a tract about veterans' problems. Similarly, ''Over There'' depicts the families as well as those in combat, and the destructiveness of war in general rather than the politics behind the conflict.</p>
        <p>Steven Bochco (''N.Y.P.D. Blue''), who created the series with Chris Gerolmo, explained in a telephone interview, ''I've always tried to avoid injecting politics into my work.'' But ''Over There'' is uncompromising in its close-up view of the physical brutality and the psychic traumas facing veterans of Iraq. Mr. Bochco said: ''It's very much in the design of the series that people rotate, people get killed. If we take the traditional view that our core group of characters is immune from that, we're not serving the concept.''</p>
        <p>A script for an early episode involves the Americans guarding a checkpoint in Iraq, where any car could be carrying either innocent civilians or suicide bombers. The difficulty of telling the lethal enemy from the benign civilian is constant, whether the setting is the gulf war, Afghanistan or Iraq. (That's one reason the wars blur together so easily on screen.) In Iraq, as in the guerilla war in Vietnam, civilian casualties can happen easily and at close range.</p>
        <p>David Ayer, who wrote and directed ''Harsh Times'' (which does not have a release date yet), said in a phone interview that for veterans of Iraq, there is ''the same sort of psychic wreckage that we've seen with our Vietnam veterans.'' Mr. Ayer, who wrote the tough-minded ''Training Day,'' sees his film as ''a cautionary tale'' about ''what killing other people does to you,'' and he added what seems like a reasonable prophecy. ''The troubled Vietnam veteran is kind of a cliché,'' he said. ''I think soon you're going to see the troubled Iraq veteran as a cliché.''</p>
