        <p>When Retief Goosen wraps his fingers around a club, he can hit a golf ball so squarely that it whistles through the wind. Why this happens, however, is a mystery to him. He does not understand why he hits the ball better than most people, or what exactly the dynamics of his swing are.</p>
        <p>For nearly seven years, he has been winning tournaments around the world, including two United States Opens, without the services of a swing coach.</p>
        <p>''What happens in a swing, I don't know,'' Goosen, a South African, said Tuesday at the T.P.C. at Las Colinas, site of the Byron Nelson Championship, which begins Thursday. ''It's all about the feel of the game for me and how I feel over the ball. It's not all about mechanics.''</p>
        <p>Goosen's choice to forgo a teacher is just one of the many differences between himself and the other top players on the PGA Tour, all of whom will be competing this week for one of the year's most coveted titles. Unlike the iconic Tiger Woods or the easily recognizable Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson, Goosen, the fifth-ranked player in the world, can move between cities largely as an unknown.</p>
        <p>That Goosen leans on his innate ability instead of one of the many swing gurus in golf is in line with a player known for expressing little outward emotion.</p>
        <p>When he won the 2001 United States Open at Southern Hills, turning back a three-putt bogey on the 72nd hole to defeat Mark Brooks in a playoff, observers were trying to figure out just who was this quiet man who could get his golf ball up and down from any thatch of grass.</p>
        <p>When Goosen was paired with Els and behind Mickelson on the final round of last year's United States Open at Shinnecock Hills, he was nearly engulfed by the roars for his opponents -- Mickelson in particular. Goosen beat Mickelson, Els and everybody else that week.</p>
        <p>''He's got the perfect temperament,'' Els, a friend and fellow South African, said of Goosen at the time.</p>
        <p>Goosen, 36, has at times employed a sports psychologist, but he depends on his own eyes and hands to diagnose any swing faults, which is a rarity in today's game. Woods has won the Masters under the tutelage of two different coaches -- Butch Harmon and Hank Haney. Mickelson employs a swing coach for his long game (Rick Smith) and for his short game (Dave Pelz). Even Els and Singh consult swing teachers. (Els has worked with David Leadbetter, Singh with Farid Guedra.)</p>
        <p>Goosen said he has developed a routine to detect the tendencies of his swing when he is struggling.</p>
        <p>''I go through a checklist of things and bad habits that I know that creep in,'' Goosen said. ''For me, it's about the basics.''</p>
        <p>During his youth, Goosen was one of South Africa's top players before he was struck by lightning while playing golf there when he was 17. For several years, he dealt with complications, including hearing loss and weakness in his heart.</p>
        <p>Though some of his prime years were taken from him, his golfing gifts returned. His swing, a fluid, repeatable motion, is one that the fellow pro Justin Leonard calls beautiful.</p>
        <p>''I think we all know Retief as being a very quiet and gentle guy,'' Leonard said Tuesday. ''Obviously, he handles pressure well. The guy seems pretty unflappable, confident and he plays smart.''</p>
        <p>Byron Nelson, 93 and one of the game's greatest champions, has also become appreciative of Goosen, who is playing in Nelson's tournament for the first time.</p>
        <p>When Goosen flew into Dallas Love Field on Monday, he was surprised to find Nelson's wife, Peggy, waiting for him in the terminal.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'Well, it's nice of her to greet me,''' Goosen said. ''And then we walked to the car and she said, 'I've got somebody waiting in the car for you.'</p>
        <p>''I thought maybe my caddie or something. It was Mr. Nelson sitting in the front seat. It was a great way to arrive at a golf tournament.''</p>
