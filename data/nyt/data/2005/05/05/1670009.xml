        <p>Charity Hope Valentine, the cockeyed optimist from the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity,'' believes that fairy tales do come true, despite cruel evidence to the contrary. So, it would seem, does Christina Applegate, the appealing but underequipped star of the lukewarm revival of ''Sweet Charity'' that opened last night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater after weeks of widely reported toil and strife.</p>
        <p>The road to Broadway for this production has generated theater news of a kind you supposed didn't happen anymore, or perhaps never really happened except in old backstage movies. Star breaks leg (well, a bone in her foot) twirling off lamppost onstage in Chicago; talented understudy (Charlotte d'Amboise) opens for star in Boston; producers decide to close show; star insists that she will, will get better in time for a delayed New York opening and helps raise the extra money to ensure show's arrival, just before the deadline for Tony nominations. And you thought ''42nd Street'' was just moonshine.</p>

        <p>Charity Hope Valentine, the cockeyed optimist from the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity,'' believes that fairy tales do come true, despite cruel evidence to the contrary. So, it would seem, does Christina Applegate, the appealing but underequipped star of the lukewarm revival of ''Sweet Charity'' that opened last night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater after weeks of widely reported toil and strife.</p>
        <p>The road to Broadway for this production has generated theater news of a kind you supposed didn't happen anymore, or perhaps never really happened except in old backstage movies. Star breaks leg (well, a bone in her foot) twirling off lamppost onstage in Chicago; talented understudy (Charlotte d'Amboise) opens for star in Boston; producers decide to close show; star insists that she will, will get better in time for a delayed New York opening and helps raise the extra money to ensure show's arrival, just before the deadline for Tony nominations. And you thought ''42nd Street'' was just moonshine.</p>
        <p>So when Ms. Applegate steps into view at the Hirschfeld, in a tiny red dress and a halo of adrenaline, it is to the accompaniment of excited thoughts from an audience braced for a Busby Berkeley-style climax, be it triumph or catastrophe. (Look, she's standing next to that dangerous lamppost! Look, she's wearing unflattering ankle boots for therapeutic support! Look, one leg seems to bend less easily than the other!) And then Ms. Applegate starts to sing and dance and a collective sigh stirs the air that sounds like relief, yes, but also deflation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Applegate, who is best known for 11 seasons as the dopey daughter on the sitcom ''Married With Children,'' exudes a soft hopefulness and a sterner determination that suit her character, an unlucky dance-hall hostess in eternal pursuit of love. She has a comic polish that considerately stops short of polyurethane sheen, and an easy, conversational way with a song, even if her voice isn't always on pitch.</p>
        <p>But as a character meant to be a shopworn angel, Ms. Applegate looks more like a merry cherub, an ing√©nue fresh from the suburbs. More important, in the musical numbers, she seems to grow smaller rather than bigger, which is one thing that definitely should not happen if you are playing Charity Hope Valentine.</p>
        <p>The magic generated four decades ago by ''Sweet Charity,'' which has a first-rate score by Cy Coleman (with charming lyrics by Dorothy Fields) and a second-rate book by Neil Simon, presumably came mostly from the alchemical collaboration of its original director and choreographer, Bob Fosse, and its star, Gwen Verdon. They were virtuosos of a sweet-and-sour style that must have gone a long way in leavening the winking cuteness of a show that featured a dance-hall hostess as its heroine, a bizarrely quaint profession even 40 years ago. (The character was a streetwalker in the 1957 movie that inspired ''Sweet Charity,'' Federico Fellini's ''Nights of Cabiria.'')</p>
        <p>When it was revived in 1986, with Fosse again in charge and Debbie Allen in the title role, ''Sweet Charity'' showed its age, but not in the dance numbers. The choreography still pulsed with the defiant, angular eroticism that was Fosse, a man whose oft-cited equation of showbiz with prostitution seemed particularly appropriate in this case. But the production asked a question that boded ill for future incarnations: Could ''Charity'' possibly soar without the Fosse touch and a star who thrilled to it?</p>
        <p>This latest revival, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, answers that question with a weary ''no.'' While the overture, with its delicious opening vamp from the song ''Big Spender,'' makes you salivate, the main course never seems to arrive.</p>
        <p>The show is steeped in a fuzzy, Pop-colored campiness that whispers raspingly, ''Weren't the 60's a hoot?,'' and includes visual references to Andy Warhol (the person) and Color Field painting. This sensibility translates more attractively into the show's costumes (by the omnipresent William Ivey Long) than into its set (Scott Pask) and lighting (Brian MacDevitt), which suggest quickly set up, psychedelic-themed store displays at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cilento's choreography is similarly ersatz and soft-edged, acknowledging and blurring the original Fosse blueprint. (The best numbers here are the most unapologetically Fosse-like, ''Rich Man's Frug'' and ''Big Spender.'') The dances never achieve more than a low-grade fever, when what's wanted is that old steam heat. The pop-religion parody, ''The Rhythm of Life,'' usually a guaranteed showstopper, fizzles for want of choreographic and satiric sharpness.</p>
        <p>The supporting cast includes solid pros like Ernie Sabella (as the dance-hall proprietor) and, as two of the many men in Charity's life, Denis O'Hare and the handsome-voiced Paul Schoeffler. Doing a variation on his Tony-winning performance as a neurotic gay accountant in Richard Greenberg's ''Take Me Out,'' Mr. O'Hare at least provides some comic oxygen as a neurotic heterosexual accountant.</p>
        <p>As Charity's hard-bitten best friends (and co-workers), Janine LaManna and Kyra Da Costa bring an otherwise absent spark to ''There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This,'' an exultant skirt-swishing tribute to the ''America'' sequence from ''West Side Story.'' Ms. Applegate, it should be noted, the third member of the trio, more or less disappears in this number.</p>
        <p>Actually, whenever Ms. Applegate dances, she shrinks, even in big solo turns like ''If My Friends Could See Me Now.'' She is a graceful physical comedian, and she reads her lines with winning conviction (though she sometimes sounds as if she has spent a lot of time watching Shirley MacLaine in the 1969 film adaptation).</p>
        <p>But while she executes her steps with care and precision, dance is not a transcendent form of self-expression for Ms. Applegate. And let's face it, neither is song. Nor ultimately does she have the sheer freakish force of personality to make her numbers work despite this, as the musically challenged Melanie Griffith did when she joined the cast of ''Chicago.''</p>
        <p>Thus it is that ''Sweet Charity'' concludes a Broadway season weak on musicals not with a hoped-for fanfare but with an all-too-appropriate wistful whimper.</p>
