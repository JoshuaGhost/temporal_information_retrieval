        <p>An F.B.I. employee who tried to stop an assault in Jersey City yesterday morning suffered a broken leg when the assailant rammed her with her own vehicle, the police said. The employee, whose name was withheld by the police, was driving her Jeep Liberty about 8 a.m. when she saw someone assaulting an elderly man at Route 440 and Sipp Avenue, the police said. She stopped her car to intervene, and the assailant attacked her, said Capt. Jon Tooke, a police spokesman. Steve Siegel, a spokesman for the F.B.I.'s office in Newark, declined to describe the woman's duties, saying only that she was was not a special agent. ''This was not job-related,'' Agent Siegel said. ''It was doing-a-good-deed-related.''</p>
