        <p>Two young girls riding a bicycle together were seriously injured yesterday when they rode into an intersection and were struck by a pizza deliveryman's car, the police said. The accident happened about 3:40 p.m. when the girls, Valerie McCarthy, 14, of West Islip, and Frances Jedlicka, 8, of Lindenhurst, rode into the intersection of Hunter Avenue and Toomey Road. Frances was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip, where she was in critical condition. Valerie was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital, where she was in stable condition. The police issued a summons to the deliveryman, whom they identified as Stephen F. Carrasso, 20. They said that he had been driving with a suspended license and that his car had been impounded for a safety check.</p>
