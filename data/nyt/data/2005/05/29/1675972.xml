        <p>This week, Newmarket Films will release ''Rock School,'' a movie about a hyperactive, slightly portly musician who teaches a scrappy band of preteens the fundamentals of rock music. If that sounds like a similarly titled 2003 film starring Jack Black -- well, it's an uncanny coincidence. It's also a sore point with Paul Green, whose Paul Green School of Rock Music is the subject of ''Rock School,'' a documentary by Don Argott. Here's a quick study guide for the School of Rock, ''School of Rock'' and ''Rock School.''</p>
        <p>1997 -- Paul Green, a Philadelphia musician, convenes weekly jam sessions for his guitar students, which he calls Rock School after Herbie Hancock's public television series.</p>
        <p>NOVEMBER 1998 -- As the Paul Green School of Rock Music, Mr. Green's students play a gig at a local art opening and go on to do shows around Philadelphia and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>APRIL 2000 -- Spurred by news coverage, enrollment doubles to 40 students, prompting Mr. Green to lease a three-story town house for an after-school program.</p>
        <p>APRIL 2002 -- Mr. Green registers www.schoolofrock.com. The next month, VH1 sends a crew to document the school for a reality series that never materializes.</p>
        <p>JANUARY 2003 -- Intrigued by ubiquitous posters for rock school performances, Don Argott approaches Mr. Green about making a documentary. Filming begins that month.</p>
        <p>APRIL 2003 -- Mr. Green learns from his students that Paramount, a corporate sibling of VH1, has begun production on ''School of Rock'' starring Jack Black.</p>
        <p>SEPTEMBER 2003 -- A rough cut of ''Rock School'' plays at the Independent Feature Project festival in New York. ''School of Rock'' has its premiere the same week. Paramount and Mike White, who wrote the screenplay, deny any connection between their film and Mr. Green's story. ''Their denials were, 'Never heard of him,''' Mr. Green said. ''Come on. They have interns; these interns do research -- I own schoolofrock.com! They heard of me.''</p>
        <p>JUNE 2004 -- ''Rock School'' has its premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival and is purchased by Newmarket Films. Newmarket receives a letter from Paramount's legal department objecting to the similarity of the title ''Rock School'' to ''School of Rock.'' The dispute is resolved without incident.</p>
