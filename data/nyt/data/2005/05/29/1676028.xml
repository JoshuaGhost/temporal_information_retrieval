        <p>EVER since Broadwater Energy announced plans to build a platform and pipeline for liquefied natural gas in the middle of Long Island Sound last November, opinions on the proposal have flourished.</p>
        <p>The company has pointed to the possibility of lower natural gas prices. Opponents have pointed to the potential for fires or environmental problems from accidents or terrorism. And politicians have begun weighing in on whether the platform and pipeline should be built.</p>
        <p>But the task of collecting data and assessing potential risks falls to the Coast Guard, which must present its findings to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The commission could rule on Broadwater's request for a permit next year.</p>
        <p>Among its regular duties, the Coast Guard patrols the Sound, but its mission has become more complicated with the fact-finding mission and risk assessment of a heavily used waterway.</p>
        <p>Rick Ball II, a chief boatswain's mate in the Coast Guard, pointed to a nautical map of the western Sound and said, ''We're the backdoor to Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>As the executive petty officer at the Coast Guard station at Eatons Neck, Chief Ball supervises the daily Homeland Security patrols of the western Sound. He assigns four Coast Guardsmen, who carry 9-millimeter pistols, to a 25-foot cutter commissioned by the Coast Guard for just such purposes.</p>
        <p>''We have what we like to call a regular random scheduled activity,'' Chief Ball said. ''We go into the nooks and crannies of our area of responsibility, and we stop certain boats and ask, 'Where have you been?'''</p>
        <p>Now the question is whether the Coast Guard might be checking natural gas tankers, too.</p>
        <p>In November, Shell U.S. Gas and Power and the TransCanada Corporation formed Broadwater, which has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a permit to build the storage platform and pipeline, which it would open in 2010. Broadwater plans to complete the formal filing later this year.</p>
        <p>Public debate began immediately after the announcement, and it has spilled over into political debate. This month the Suffolk County Legislature voted unanimously to oppose the Broadwater plan, Senator Charles E. Schumer announced his opposition and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed reservations after speaking with commission officials.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that having a project of this nature will engender a lot of strong feelings,'' said John Hritcko Jr., the senior vice president at Broadwater.</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard will study both the safety and security implications of the Broadwater plant. There, tankers would unload liquefied gas, or L.N.G., which is mostly methane that has been frozen at minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. It would then be warmed to a gaseous state and pumped underwater to New York City, Long Island and Connecticut for retail sale and to fuel power plants.</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard undertook a two-day Ports and Waterways Safety Assessment earlier this month in Port Jefferson, and as part of the process, it invited 30 people -- commercial fishermen, recreational boaters, ferry captains and representatives from environmental groups and from Broadwater -- to give their opinions. Although the assessment dealt with both security and safety, security issues are scheduled to be addressed separately in closed meetings conducted by the Coast Guard this summer and fall.</p>
        <p>''Although there are relationships between safety and security, there are differences,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Alan Blume, the chief of the prevention department in the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office for Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>Capt. David Scott testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last February. ''The Coast Guard has long recognized the unique safety and security challenges posed by transporting millions of gallons of L.N.G. or 'cryogenic methane,''' he said.</p>
        <p>If there were an accident involving the Broadwater platform or a ship carrying liquefied natural gas, a vapor cloud of the methane could travel two to four miles, said Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale. The vapor cloud could also ignite, and the cold gas could crack any metal structure and asphyxiate those on board the tanker, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Esposito cited a December 2004 report on liquid natural gas accidents, a document produced for the Department of Energy by a Sandia Corporation laboratory in Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>''The report concludes that an intentional breach of the L.N.G. containers could occur,'' she said. ''There could be an initial ignition. They don't like to call it an explosion. If that occurs, this fire would burn so hotly there's no way to extinguish it.''</p>
        <p>Maureen Dolan, who represented the Citizens Campaign for the Environment at the assessment meeting, said that a key point of discussion was how two or three tankers going through the Race -- a three-mile-wide channel at the northeastern edge of the Sound -- would affect traffic. The Race accommodates thousands of recreational and commercial boats each year.</p>
        <p>The Maritime Transportation Safety Act of 2002 requires a security zone around a ship carrying liquefied natural gas. No other vessel is supposed to be within a mile of the bow, 100 feet of the stern or 500 feet to either side.</p>
        <p>''That's quite a chunk of the Race to be taken away two to three times a week,'' Ms. Esposito said.</p>
        <p>Broadwater's proposed location, 9 miles from Wading River and 11 miles from New Haven, is also under scrutiny. Nautical charts distributed at the safety assessment meeting showed that the site could obstruct commercial traffic.</p>
        <p>''It's premature at this point to say what its impact would be,'' Commander Blume said. ''We don't have the answer. If we did, we wouldn't need an assessment.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hritcko said that the Broadwater plant ''would fit in quite nicely'' in the Sound and would not be in a major shipping lane.</p>
        <p>''Long Island Sound is not an isolated backwater,'' he said. ''Broadwater is consistent with the use of the Sound, with ships entering the Sound. It's right in line with activities that have been in place all along.''</p>
        <p>In 2004, Commander Blume said, some 570 ships under foreign flags arrived in the Sound, and more than half were tankers carrying petroleum products. The Broadwater proposal would add 100 to 150 arrivals, each subject to provisions of the Maritime Transportation Safety Act, including 96 hours' notice of arrival.</p>
        <p>Each ship's host government must also provide lists of crew members and their passports, the ship's previous ports of call and cargo information. The Coast Guard routinely boards ships carrying liquefied natural gas, checking for security violations, and monitors their transit.</p>
        <p>''The Maritime Transportation Safety Act, that's a pretty big deal,'' Chief Ball said. ''Any boats that come into here, we're going to know about ahead of time if they're playing legit. If they're not playing legit, I'm sure we're still going to know about it.''</p>
        <p>When asked whether a cargo ship or tanker could slip in undetected, Chief Ball said: ''No way. We're the federal government.''</p>
        <p>But Brian Lee, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spokesman in Washington, said that there was no denying the potential for terrorism involving a project like Broadwater. ''There is no energy infrastructure in the country that is not a potential terrorist target, whether it's a transmission line or a natural gas pipeline,'' he said. ''As a society, we assume a certain level of risk for the benefit the activity provides. It doesn't take rocket science to analyze this. We need to look at the severe economic threat that high demand and insufficient supply for natural gas provide.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hritcko contends that the Broadwater plant's economic and environmental benefits would outweigh the risks. ''The biggest gains from Broadwater will be an economic supply of natural gas, a means of clearing the air in this region by replacing fossil fuel,'' he said. ''It will contain prices, bringing a net economic benefit to the tristate area.''</p>
        <p>One crucial player, the KeySpan Energy Corporation, the Island's natural gas supplier, has not taken a stand. If the Broadwater plant is built, KeySpan could presumably buy natural gas from it, perhaps at lower prices. ''We have not done any analysis or feasibility studies at this time,'' said Diana Parisi, KeySpan's director of media relations. ''We have not made any decision.''</p>
        <p>Economics notwithstanding, the possibility of a fire involving liquefied natural gas emerged from the Port and Waterways Safety Assessment as a concern for Suffolk County's emergency-response officials.</p>
        <p>Commander Blume said that several emergency-response officials said they could not combat a fire from an accident or attack on the Broadwater plant or on a tanker carrying liquefied natural gas.</p>
        <p>''Firefighting capabilities on the Sound, it's limited,'' he said. ''The firefighting equipment on commercial tugs are pretty good, but the one fireboat operated by a fire department is in the Port of New York and New Jersey.'' The boat is stationed in the East River just south of the Brooklyn Bridge, about 80 miles from the Broadwater site.</p>
        <p>Joe Williams, Suffolk's fire commissioner, said he had looked at studies of other liquefied natural gas plants around the country and acknowledged the need for an emergency plan to protect the public.</p>
        <p>''This plant is going to be completely surrounded by water,'' he said. ''Based on the size and uniqueness, there's a potential for anything.''</p>
        <p>Although Broadwater would be required by law to have firefighting equipment on the platform and to draw up an emergency plan, the provisions would cover only employees.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very dangerous to pretend that thousands of people aren't out on Long Island Sound at any given time,'' said Ms. Esposito of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment. ''Long Island Sound is not the Dead Sea.''</p>
