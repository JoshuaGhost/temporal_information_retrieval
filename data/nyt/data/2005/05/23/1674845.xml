        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Marriage of Unequals'' (''Class Matters'' series, front page, May 19):</p>
        <p>I was raised in a working-class home and taught to treat all people with respect. Having gone to Yale and Stanford, I have ''jumped class,'' so to speak.</p>
        <p>My favorite class story happened in business school when small groups of three were asked to guess one another's least-known attribute. When we stymied each other, I confessed that my parents were factory workers. To my amazement, the second person burst into a smile and said, ''My dad is a garbage man.''</p>
        <p>The two of us thought it was very amusing, but not our third member. She, obviously of higher class, looked at us strangely and said, ''Aren't you ashamed?''</p>
        <p>To this day I wish I had shot back that at least we knew that where we were was based on our own talents and not on our parents' money and social standing. Rich people, poor people, sometimes they forget they are all humans and not labels.</p>
