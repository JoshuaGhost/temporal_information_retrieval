        <p>Good taste is neither Republican nor Democratic (Deborah Solomon, April 24). It's the injection of a political viewpoint and correctness (even into children's programs) to which fans object. I like ''Masterpiece Theater,'' ''Nova'' and ''NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on Fridays, when David Brooks and Mark Shields review the week (on other days, I agree with Ferree that sometimes ''it's slow''). Kathleen Cox should have known that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I have a feeling Ferree already knows that.</p>
