        <p>A day after hammering each other's property tax relief plans during a televised debate, the two front-runners in New Jersey's Republican primary for governor, Douglas R. Forrester and Bret D. Schundler, continued their harsh exchanges Wednesday by attacking each other's credibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler, the party's nominee in 2001, called a press conference to demand that Mr. Forrester apologize to voters for, Mr. Schundler said, misleading the public about both their records. Mr. Forrester wasted no time responding: his campaign spokeswoman attended the Schundler press conference and distributed a flier titled ''Top 10 Lies'' of Mr. Schundler.</p>

        <p>A day after hammering each other's property tax relief plans during a televised debate, the two front-runners in New Jersey's Republican primary for governor, Douglas R. Forrester and Bret D. Schundler, continued their harsh exchanges Wednesday by attacking each other's credibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler, the party's nominee in 2001, called a press conference to demand that Mr. Forrester apologize to voters for, Mr. Schundler said, misleading the public about both their records. Mr. Forrester wasted no time responding: his campaign spokeswoman attended the Schundler press conference and distributed a flier titled ''Top 10 Lies'' of Mr. Schundler.</p>
        <p>The sudden escalation of verbal warfare in a primary that had been gracious comes as the campaign enters its final three weeks. Mr. Forrester, whose wealth has allowed him to spend more than the other six candidates combined, has gained a bit of momentum in the polls. But Mr. Schundler seized the Republican nomination in 2001 with virtually no support from party leaders, and with his enthusiastic backing from conservative advocacy groups, many political analysts believe he has an advantage in this year's race, which has seven candidates and is expected to have a low turnout. Mr. Forrester and Mr. Schundler have led in virtually every public opinion poll.</p>
        <p>The flashpoint for Wednesday's exchange was a radio ad released by the Forrester campaign, which accuses Mr. Schundler of instituting an income tax on Jersey City residents when he was mayor in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler called the commercial misleading and said he had supported only a payroll tax on corporations -- not individuals -- and only because the Democratic City Council had been set to adopt the measure and had had a veto-proof majority. Even then, Mr. Schundler explained Wednesday, his support for the plan was grudging: he tried to impose it for only one fiscal quarter, because the state had been threatening to strip Jersey City of the right to tax businesses.</p>
        <p>But the Forrester campaign insisted that Mr. Schundler was a vigorous proponent of the tax, abandoning it only after a judge struck it down and forced Jersey City to return the money. And in 1995, political analysts and business leaders did not view Mr. Schundler as a reluctant conscript in the battle for the payroll tax, according to news reports. Mr. Schundler continued to advocate the tax, even after it incited a tax revolt by an unlikely coalition of corporate executives and unions. At the time, the president of the city's Chamber of Commerce, Peter T.D. Murphy, called Mr. Schundler's justification for the payroll tax ''disingenuous.''</p>
        <p>In his press conference Wednesday, Mr. Schundler also tried to regain the offensive by calling Mr. Forrester's property tax reduction plan deceptive, warning that the Democrats' presumptive nominee, Senator Jon S. Corzine, would use it to bury the Republican ticket this fall if Mr. Forrester won the nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler said that Mr. Forrester's property tax plan, which calls for the state to pay $3 billion to local governments to lower property taxes, would raise the deficit to $5 billion, too much to recoup by cutting wasteful spending.</p>
        <p>''If you cannot find $5 billion worth of corruption, waste fraud and abuse, doesn't that mean you would have to raise taxes to pay for this new spending program?'' Mr. Schundler said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrester's spokeswoman, Sherry Sylvester, said that the state government was so bloated with pet projects and waste that Mr. Forrester would be able to identify the funds needed for tax relief.</p>
        <p>''Jim McGreevey raised spending $4 billion in the last year,'' said Ms. Sylvester, referring to the former governor. ''That alone is enough to pay for the phase-in of the property tax relief program. There's only a deficit if you believe that no state spending can be cut.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrester's campaign, meanwhile, accused Mr. Schundler of misstating his record at Tuesday's debate by saying he had ''never'' supported a proposal to build a hockey arena in Newark. Responding to questions from reporters at his press conference, Mr. Schundler said that he had supported a proposal to spend state money to improve infrastructure around an arena paid for with private funds. But when the proposal was changed, and state money was to be used for the arena, Mr. Schundler said, he immediately opposed it.</p>
        <p>Although some Republicans worried that the intensifying rhetoric between Mr. Schundler and Mr. Forrester might weaken the party as it approached the fall elections, Tom Wilson, the state Republican chairman, said he was not yet concerned.</p>
