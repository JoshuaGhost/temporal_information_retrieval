        <p>M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, will begin charging E-ZPass customers a $1 monthly service fee starting on July 1. The fee is similar to that charged by other agencies, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, that participate in E-ZPass, the electronic toll collection system. The estimated revenue from the fee, about $13 million a year, will help pay for administrative costs associated with managing E-ZPass accounts. The agency, which operates nine bridges and tunnels, said it had invested ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' since E-ZPass was introduced in the metropolitan region in 1993, while providing electronic toll-payment tags to customers at no cost.</p>
