        <p>Like a giant awakened from sleep, Shaquille O'Neal lumbered a bit, adrenaline carrying him off the bench and onto the court at American Airlines Arena after a 13-day layoff.</p>
        <p>But by the end of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Detroit Pistons' defense had worn down O'Neal, and the Miami Heat had encountered a roadblock of championship proportions.</p>
        <p>Nothing was the same for the Heat on Monday night -- not its undefeated playoff record after two series sweeps and especially not its star guard, Dwyane Wade. The defending champion Pistons frustrated Wade into a 7-of-25 shooting night, and their defense clamped down on the Heat in the final five minutes. Miami did not score a field goal after the score was tied at 80-80, and the Pistons seized a 90-81 victory.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of opportunities to win this game,'' a subdued O'Neal, plagued by a right thigh bruise, said after scoring 20 points in 33 minutes. ''The guys, they now understand that it's not going to be easy. We play better when we have to fight.''</p>
        <p>Rasheed Wallace roamed free on the perimeter and knocked down 4 of 5 3-pointers, leading the Pistons with 20 points and 3 blocked shots, and 4 of his 10 rebounds came in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Ben Wallace grabbed 6 of his game-high 13 rebounds in that period, including two crucial rebounds that preserved a thin lead in the final five minutes. Chauncey Billups, nicknamed Mr. Big Shot, immediately hit a jumper to break a 80-80 tie, and the Pistons led the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>O'Neal made only the first of two free throws with 4 minutes 36 seconds to play, and that would be the Heat's final point. With 1:35 to play, Udonis Haslem attempted a 19-foot jumper, but Rasheed Wallace came out and blocked the shot, leading to a Richard Hamilton basket for a 5-point Detroit lead.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, Wade missed a 3-pointer with 38.9 seconds left that would have drawn the Heat within a basket. Wade, who averaged 28.6 points and 51.9 percent shooting in the playoffs, finished with 16 points.</p>
        <p>Tayshaun Prince, an all-limbs 6-foot-9 defender, frustrated Wade all night -- as he did in two regular-season games. The Pistons also threw different defensive combinations at Wade, including Rasheed Wallace and Hamilton, so Wade never had a comfort zone.</p>
        <p>''No question, this was one of the best defensive teams in the league, especially in the playoffs when every game they tune in on what you do,'' Wade said. ''Sometimes, I just missed shots and made bad decisions tonight, and I will correct them.''</p>
        <p>It was a defiant attitude the Heat carried, drawing inspiration from O'Neal. ''Hurting or not hurting, he really wants to win and he came out tonight and proved it,'' Wade said.</p>
        <p>O'Neal had not played since May 10, missing the final two games of the Washington series after bruising his thigh in a collision with Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal on April 17.</p>
        <p>''It was hurting this morning; as the day went on, I wanted to play, I wanted to play, the adrenaline kicked in, and it got looser,'' O'Neal said.</p>
        <p>''I had been testing it all day and I had a meeting with Stan and he said a 30 percent Shaq is better than no Shaq at all,'' he said, referring to Coach Stan Van Gundy. ''I just wanted to get the guys going early and play our game.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal made a turnaround jumper to open the game, accompanied by thunderous applause. Soon, he was energized and, after two Eddie Jones baskets, O'Neal scored on three consecutive possessions: a turnaround, a one-handed jam off an offensive rebound and a turnaround hook shot.</p>
        <p>But Van Gundy took O'Neal out for Alonzo Mourning midway through the first quarter. He was cognizant of playing O'Neal only for short bursts, then putting him back in quickly to prevent his thigh from stiffening.</p>
        <p>By the second half, however, the Pistons altered their defensive strategy on O'Neal, recognizing that he did not have the same lift. Detroit Coach Larry Brown said that his players all ''yelled'' at him to go at O'Neal harder with double coverage.</p>
        <p>After shooting 6 of 8 in the first half, O'Neal was 3 of 6 in the second half, including 1 of 3 in the final quarter. ''I just missed some shots,'' O'Neal said. ''When I miss shots, I don't blame then on anything. I won't miss those shots on Wednesday.''</p>
        <p>Brown praised his players' defensive performance as the best of the season. On offense, the Pistons scored 15 second-chance points, burying the Heat on the boards with the quickness O'Neal and Mourning lacked. Over all, Detroit outrebounded the Heat, 41-34.</p>
        <p>''I watched him; he's having a hard time jumping off of one leg,'' Brown said of O'Neal. ''He's amazing that he could be as effective as he was without playing.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal, who has been undergoing intensive medical treatment -- including 30 minutes after the game Monday -- could not predict his condition for Game 2. ''I'm not worrying about it now; tomorrow is a rest day, and we'll see how it goes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said this night could be the best lesson for his team. ''I told the guys, hey, this is really a test for us, we'd been having it pretty easy for the first two rounds,'' he said. ''We just got to come out and fight.''</p>
