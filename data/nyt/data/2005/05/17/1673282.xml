        <p>As a 62-year-old playwright and director, Steve Karp carried around one story from his college days that he knew had the makings of a play: the moral anxiety he felt back at Tufts University in 1961, when Delta Tau Delta, a popular fraternity with a history of racial, religious and ethnic exclusion, recruited him and another Jewish classmate for membership.</p>

        <p>STAMFORD, Conn., May 16 - As a 62-year-old playwright and director, Steve Karp carried around one story from his college days that he knew had the makings of a play: the moral anxiety he felt back at Tufts University in 1961, when Delta Tau Delta, a popular fraternity with a history of racial, religious and ethnic exclusion, recruited him and another Jewish classmate for membership.</p>

        <p>As a 62-year-old playwright and director, Steve Karp carried around one story from his college days that he knew had the makings of a play: the moral anxiety he felt back at Tufts University in 1961, when Delta Tau Delta, a popular fraternity with a history of racial, religious and ethnic exclusion, recruited him and another Jewish classmate for membership.</p>
        <p>Much as he longed to belong to a fraternity filled with campus leaders and star athletes, he was not sure acquiescing was the right thing to do or that he was acting in the best of motives. Was he interested in being the example that would help other outsiders who would follow? Or was he looking to shed his Jewish identity and blend in?</p>
        <p>Unsure how to tell the story and unsure how he would fare in the telling, Mr. Karp instead wrote six other plays and screenplays and threw himself into starting the Stamford Theater Works, a professional regional theater he runs out of a converted barn on the grounds of Sacred Heart Academy here.</p>
        <p>At the theater, he put on issue-oriented plays and avoided revisiting his formative religious experience. ''I was a little afraid, I think, to confront myself on this issue,'' said Mr. Karp, who describes himself as an occasional participant at a Conservative synagogue in town. ''I didn't know how I would come out as a Jew.''</p>
        <p>But a few years ago, he changed his mind when he figured out how to capture the story on stage and grew old enough not to care anymore what anyone, including himself, might have to say about the younger Steve Karp.</p>
        <p>The result is a heavily autobiographical 90-minute work titled ''Fraternity,'' which has been appearing here in an extended run, through Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karp's character in the play is ''Sam Katz,'' and other characters are modeled on shadows from his past, some of whom have their real names in the play. There is ''Eddie Solomon,'' Mr. Karp's Jewish roommate, who chides him for wanting to belong to a group that long shunned his kind; Betsy Kay, the freshman goddess he is smitten with until he learns that she, too, is Jewish; Larry Clinton and Don Curtis, Delta members who want to challenge the fraternity's restrictive membership rules; and Delta's chapter adviser, a university trustee who is dead-set against altering the policy. In a line that draws gasps, the adviser finally accepts Mr. Katz, but warns the agitators, ''Don't look under the rocks for any more of them.''</p>
        <p>Tufts alumni have been flocking to the show. At Sunday's matinee, all 150 seats were filled with graduates from the classes of 1962 through 1965 and their guests. Another 25 alumni, including the real Mr. Clinton and Mr. Curtis, saw it on April 30.</p>
        <p>In a discussion and reception held after Sunday's performance, theatergoers praised Mr. Karp for tackling a murky episode in Tufts's history, while they quibbled over some of the details.</p>
        <p>''This took some guts,'' said Arthur House, a Delta member. As student council president, he had pressed the administration to alter some discriminatory practices but did not grasp at the time how his fraternity's exclusionary policies had affected his friend, Mr. Karp.</p>
        <p>''I'm really proud of Steve, realizing what he went through back then and sharing it with everyone through the play,'' said Mr. House, who became a White House fellow and chief of staff to two Democratic senators. ''I never focused on what it meant personally to a close friend of mine.''</p>
        <p>Tom Gordon, another audience member who was in Delta when it was debating whether to admit Mr. Katz and the other Jewish pledge, Michael Bernstein, said ''it was very close to the way things actually happened.'' He even heard the adviser utter the line about turning over rocks, which he said left his fraternity brothers speechless.</p>
        <p>To refresh his memory while writing the play, Mr. Karp said he read campus newspapers from the early 1960's and contacted Mr. Clinton and Mr. Curtis to better understand their motivation in soliciting him. While he was less sure about his own actions, he said, ''As I got older, I really began thinking of these guys as heroic.''</p>
        <p>Much as some Delta members would now like to think that they wanted to do the right thing, Mr. Gordon said the play was accurate in showing that ''it wasn't all altruistic.'' He said many fraternity members wanted to associate with whomever they pleased and would have quit if the restrictive policies had not bent with the times.</p>
        <p>Today, Tufts, just outside Boston in Medford, Mass., hardly resembles the campus in the play. For starters, the university has a Jewish president, Lawrence S. Bacow.</p>
        <p>But much as one barrier may have fallen, those gathered said others took longer to dismantle. ''I only saw one or two black people on campus the whole time I was there,'' said Frederick H. Hauck, a former astronaut, who at Tufts was a member of the rival fraternity, Delta Upsilon, which was open to Jews.</p>
        <p>Though his fraternity takes some licks in the play, he said: ''I hope members of the administration get to see it. This message is a good message for anyone who has to deal with these issues institutionally.''</p>
        <p>Others handled similar circumstances differently. For instance, the real Betsy Kay, now deceased, turned in her Chi Omega pin in protest against the national Chi Omega organization when it voted overwhelmingly in 1964 against amending its requirement that all members be ''white Christians,'' according to Jean Van Peursem Ferlazzo, Chi Omega's president at the time.</p>
        <p>But Robert Hormats, the vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs International, had a different reaction after a performance earlier this month. He was part of a second wave of Jewish students who joined the fraternity the following year, and he credited Mr. Karp for paving the way.</p>
        <p>''He saw something that was good in those people in that they did want to open up,'' said Mr. Hormats. ''And when I came, they were very welcoming.''</p>
        <p>Jason Schuchman, the actor who plays Mr. Karp's roommate, said the issue of exclusion still resonated at Tufts when he graduated in 1999. ''When I was there,'' said Mr. Schuchman, ''you'd go to the cafeteria and still have all the black students sitting together and the Asian students sitting together. People stick with what they know.''</p>
        <p>He said Tufts now ''has a very healthy Jewish population. But the issues never really go away.''</p>
