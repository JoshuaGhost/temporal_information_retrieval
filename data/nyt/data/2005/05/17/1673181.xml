        <p>Inside a 10-foot-high fence at the Meadowlark Botanical Gardens in suburban Washington, woodland wildflowers have been putting on a carefully choreographed show since mid-March.</p>
        <p>The bloodroots took the stage first, unfurling white petals around their yellow hearts, and were followed by delicate Virginia bluebells and dainty pink spring beauties.

        <p>Inside a 10-foot-high fence at the Meadowlark Botanical Gardens in suburban Washington, woodland wildflowers have been putting on a carefully choreographed show since mid-March.</p>
        <p>The bloodroots took the stage first, unfurling white petals around their yellow hearts, and were followed by delicate Virginia bluebells and dainty pink spring beauties. Over the last week, red, white and yellow trilliums joined blue dwarf-crested iris and a handful of pink lady's slippers on a simulated mountaintop.</p>
        <p>But outside such meticulously cultivated gardens, these jewels of the forest, which include cherished flowers known as spring ephemerals, are under siege. ''They're being devastated,'' said Keith P. Tomlinson, manager of Meadowlark, in Vienna, Va.</p>
        <p>As an example he used the Mather Gorge trail in Great Falls National Park a few miles away on the Potomac River. There, bluebells, golden ragwort and trilliums are being crowded out by invasive plants and ravaged by deer. ''They're fighting for their lives,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In deciduous forests from Maine through South Carolina and stretching to the Midwest, the story is much the same. Although in some areas, spring-blooming wildflowers have other enemies, including housing developments, changes in forest densities, pollution and even nonnative worms.</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned about many of the spring wildflowers of our woodlands through the northeastern America, where their abundance is being significantly decreased,'' said Dr. Robert K. Peet, a professor of biology and ecology at the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The trend would be easy to miss. True spring ephemerals like Dutchman's breeches, Virginia bluebells, trout lilies and spring beauties flower and die in the few weeks after winter's freeze has broken and before the trees have fully leafed out and blocked the sun. The ephemerals live the rest of the year underground and are believed to have life spans of tens to hundreds of years like the trees around them.</p>
        <p>While often lumped in with those spring ephemerals, other woodland spring wildflowers like trillium lose their blooms but keep their foliage above ground throughout the summer.</p>
        <p>Determining long-term trends for wildflowers can be tricky because species can go several years without flowering, said Dr. Charles D. Canham, senior scientist and forest ecologist with the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.</p>
        <p>In addition, forests change, and the understory plants change along with them. A large, and beloved, stand of yellow lady's slipper orchids disappeared on the 6,500-acre Mohonk Preserve in New Paltz, N.Y., over 100 years. The loss was related to a thickening of the forest canopy rather than outside influences.</p>
        <p>Few broad studies have been done on perils confronting woodland spring wildflowers. But limited surveys and anecdotes suggest that there is reason for concern.</p>
        <p>''Our forests are becoming less interesting,'' said Dr. Tom Rooney, a research scientist at the University of Wisconsin who has examined the problem. ''It's similar to going to an art museum, and each time you go, there are a few pieces of art missing. It's even more insidious because of connections between the species.''</p>
        <p>In Wisconsin, where historic data from several hundred forested sites are available, Dr. Rooney said, native species have declined 18 percent in richness over the last 50 years, including the spring ephemerals and other related wildflowers.</p>
        <p>''In places that have had very limited or no deer hunting, native plant losses are four times greater than those open to deer hunting,'' Dr. Rooney said. ''The deer population has been growing steadily since the 1960's. They are having a profound effect on the spring ephemerals and other wildflowers.''</p>
        <p>At the Daniel Smiley Research Center of the Mohonk Preserve, researchers have been studying a stand of red trillium for several years to determine the deer's effects.</p>
        <p>''We can get the first flower out, but probably within a week almost all the plants are chewed off,'' said Paul C. Huth, the preserve's director of research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huth said the plants were about half their previous size and did not flower.</p>
        <p>Rivaling the deer for destructiveness are invasive plants like Japanese honeysuckle, garlic mustard and mile-a-minute weed.</p>
        <p>''In another 20 years, if the progression of invasive plants continues as it is, we can only expect that the diversity of spring ephemerals is going to continue to be reduced in association with the overbrowsing by the deer,'' Mr. Tomlinson said.</p>
        <p>Sally Anderson, president of the Virginia Native Plant Society and a resident of the western Shenandoah Valley, said invasive plants like garlic mustard and stilt weed constantly competed for space on her acre and a half, much of it wooded, while the process of clearing nearby lots to build houses has taken habitat once rich with trillium grandiflorum. The problems, Ms. Anderson said, go deeper than the loss of the flowers.</p>
        <p>''The seeds of a lot of our spring ephemerals are transported by ants,'' she noted. ''So if confined by roads and driveways and houses, the plants not going to move as easily, and they are going to lose the genetic intermixing that keeps them healthy.''</p>
        <p>Some botanists and ecologists say there is a much bigger story, beyond the threat to wildflowers, that involves the decline and diversity of understory plants. The loss of one species will probably not make a huge difference, but the loss of biodiversity in the groundcover will.</p>
        <p>In parts of the Eastern United States, forests are widely thought to be on the rebound as land cleared for agriculture and now abandoned reverts to its former state. But research is showing that much of the diversity in those forests is missing and that many spring woodland wildflowers have not reappeared.</p>
        <p>''What we have back is a shadow of its former self,'' said Dr. Canham of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies. ''There's very little rigorous documentation of plants like trillium or bloodroot. They could be much rarer now than they were 50 years ago, but it would be very hard to prove that.''</p>
