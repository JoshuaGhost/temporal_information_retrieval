        <p>The City of Boston paid $5.1 million to the family of a 21-year-old college student who was killed last October when she was struck in the eye with a pepper-spray pellet. The pellet was fired by police officers trying to control a chaotic crowd celebrating the American League pennant victory of the Boston Red Sox over the New York Yankees. The payment, to the parents of Victoria Snelgrove, a student at Emerson College, is apparently the largest wrongful death settlement ever made by the city. Police Commissioner Kathleen O'Toole said the police investigation had found that Ms. Snelgrove ''was not the target of any police action nor was she engaged in any activity that would have led police to think that she was behaving unlawfully.'' She also announced that Deputy Police Superintendent Robert E. O'Toole, who was in charge of operations in the area the night of the riot and fired one of the pellet guns, would retire from the police force after 37 years of service. The commissioner and the deputy superintendent are not related.</p>
