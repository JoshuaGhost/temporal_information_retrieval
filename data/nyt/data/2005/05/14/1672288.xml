        <p>Opening an intense new phase in the race for mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg will start an advertising blitz next week with commercials touting his leadership in guiding the city's recovery from the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a person who viewed rough versions of the ads.</p>
        <p>The ads -- 60 and 90 seconds long -- are expected to run on all major television stations in the city for 10 days, starting around the middle of the week, according to media executives knowledgeable about the plans.

        <p>Opening an intense new phase in the race for mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg will start an advertising blitz next week with commercials touting his leadership in guiding the city's recovery from the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a person who viewed rough versions of the ads.</p>
        <p>The ads -- 60 and 90 seconds long -- are expected to run on all major television stations in the city for 10 days, starting around the middle of the week, according to media executives knowledgeable about the plans. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to anger Mr. Bloomberg or his campaign.</p>
        <p>The ads are coming early in the campaign and provide a stark indication of how Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, is preparing an onslaught of spending as he seeks a second term.</p>
        <p>The media executives estimated its cost at more than $1 million, nearly as much as all four of his major Democratic opponents have been able to raise for their campaigns in the last two months combined, according to Democratic campaign officials.</p>
        <p>With none of his Democratic opponents able to run television ads, Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, is clearly trying to define himself and his record on his own terms now, before his opponents have a chance to define him, negatively, in their terms.</p>
        <p>By starting the ads next week, Mr. Bloomberg's team is also trying to take advantage of a moment in the campaign in which polls show his standing with voters rising -- and as the standing of the man most often mentioned as his likely Democratic rival in the general election, Fernando Ferrer, is plummeting. Mr. Bloomberg also began advertising early in the 2001 mayoral race, but his first commercial that year was not shown until June.</p>
        <p>Officials with Mr. Bloomberg's campaign would not comment on the planned commercial blitz, but they have made it clear for months that they fully intend to use Mr. Bloomberg's virtually limitless campaign fund to establish superiority on the airwaves and on the ground. Bringing that point home yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign released a campaign filing that showed that he had spent $5.6 million in the last two months, for a total of nearly $10 million since June 2004. That is nearly twice what his Democratic opponents can spend until their primary in September because all of them have agreed to abide by spending limits in return for receiving public matching funds.</p>
        <p>More than half of the Bloomberg campaign's money went toward what appears to be a huge ''voter list'' -- a compilation of voters' voting history, party affiliation, religious views, buying habits and media reading and viewing traits. Campaigns can use that information to tailor messages to specific groups of voters.</p>
        <p>According to the latest filing, Mr. Bloomberg spent more than $5 million on that list, which is roughly as much as President Bush spent on a similar effort during his national campaign, a former senior official with the campaign said yesterday. ''It's mind boggling,'' said Jim Jordan, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist who was a consultant to the Democratic get-out-the-vote group ACT during the presidential campaign. ''Clearly he's gone out and bought all of the consumer-related data he can get his hands on. He would have people's TV viewing habits, most of all, buying and spending habits, who subscribes to what magazines.''</p>
        <p>The polling firm of Doug Schoen, which had worked for President Bill Clinton, is compiling the voter list. The filing also showed that Mr. Bloomberg spent $275,000 on polling from Mr. Schoen, an indication that his team is more carefully keeping its thumb on the attitudes of New York City voters.</p>
        <p>The latest campaign filing from Mr. Bloomberg, like one that preceded it in March, painted a stark portrait of Mr. Bloomberg's ability to spend with impunity, especially in contrast to his rivals. Mr. Bloomberg dumped $6.5 million into his campaign coffers in four installments over the last two months, the filing showed.</p>
        <p>In contrast Mr. Ferrer raised $400,000 from individual donors during that period, his aides said. C. Virginia Fields raised about $300,000, her aides said. Anthony D. Weiner raised roughly $500,000, his aides said, and the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, raised between $175,000 and $200,000, his aides said. Mr. Bloomberg gave $150,000 in one payment last month to a senior aide, William T. Cunningham, according to the filing.</p>
        <p>The filing also seemed to indicate that Mr. Bloomberg's commercial advertising is in full swing with payments to the longtime city media consultant, David Garth, and the firm of Squier, Knapp &amp; Dunn, which produced advertisements for Mr. Bloomberg's last campaign and also for the presidential campaign of John Kerry last year.</p>
        <p>The person who viewed the ads said they would focus heavily on telling the story of a city reborn under the steady leadership of Mr. Bloomberg. Production of the ads is not completed, and there could be changes, the person said.</p>
        <p>Even as Democrats acknowledged that this would be a potentially potent storyline for the mayor, they also said they would do their best throughout the campaign to argue that things are not as rosy as Mr. Bloomberg says. And the Democrats and their campaign officials argued that Mr. Bloomberg's advertising now is an indication that he is worried.</p>
        <p>''Obviously the mayor thinks that unless he spends tens of millions of dollars he'll lose,'' Mr. Weiner said through a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Joseph Mercurio, a senior adviser to Ms. Fields, called it ''an attempt to buy the election,'' an argument that was echoed by Mr. Ferrer's campaign.</p>
        <p>Stu Loeser, a political aide for Mr. Bloomberg, declined to respond.</p>
