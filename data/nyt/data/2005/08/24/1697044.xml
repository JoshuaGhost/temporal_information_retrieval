        <p>Unsolicited, Al Leiter pushed buttons on his BlackBerry to show someone images of his 3-year-old son, Jack, sitting on a couch and watching him pitch for the Yankees. The boy, who is Leiter's miniature twin, could be seen staring at the television so carefully that an ice cream sundae might not have disrupted his attention.</p>
        <p>It was the kind of moment Leiter is desperately trying to preserve. He already has three World Series rings and is in his 19th season in the major leagues, but Leiter is craving two more months of baseball. He just wants to last long enough to sneak into October with the Yankees.</p>

        <p>Unsolicited, Al Leiter pushed buttons on his BlackBerry to show someone images of his 3-year-old son, Jack, sitting on a couch and watching him pitch for the Yankees. The boy, who is Leiter's miniature twin, could be seen staring at the television so carefully that an ice cream sundae might not have disrupted his attention.</p>
        <p>It was the kind of moment Leiter is desperately trying to preserve. He already has three World Series rings and is in his 19th season in the major leagues, but Leiter is craving two more months of baseball. He just wants to last long enough to sneak into October with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Leiter is in the starting rotation only because the Yankees have encountered endless injuries and because his terrible performance with the Florida Marlins made him expendable. Leiter knows this, but now that he is here, he hopes to prove he should hang around a little longer.</p>
        <p>On a breezy night, Leiter, the stubborn pitcher who refuses to throw the ball over the plate, hung around until the eighth inning last night. He departed with the score tied, 2-2, against the Toronto Blue Jays, and the game veered off in several directions before the Yankees rallied for two runs in the ninth and won, 5-4.</p>
        <p>Leiter recorded a no-decision and was almost burned for a loss by Tanyon Sturtze's failures, but it ended as a respectable night for him. The Yankees prevailed on Felix Escalona's bases-loaded single, and for one more start, Leiter survived and advanced.</p>
        <p>''He just held us together,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>A delighted yet measured Leiter said: ''I'm thrilled to be here. I know it sounds corny, but it's true.''</p>
        <p>Leiter gave up Vernon Wells's homer and Gregg Zaun's run-scoring single in the fourth. Other than that, he grunted his way through his longest start as a Yankee, throwing 121 pitches, then spoke about his fuzzy future.</p>
        <p>''I'm here because another team let me go,'' he said. ''There's nothing guaranteed for me.''</p>
        <p>How many pitches are left in Leiter's 39-year-old arm? Not many, he admitted. How many pitches does he have for the Yankees? As many as they want, he stressed. Leiter is not worried about saving himself for 2006 because it is unlikely there will be a 2006 season for him.</p>
        <p>That is why Leiter told Torre last week that he could help the Yankees as a left-handed reliever -- even though he has started for virtually his entire career. Leiter analyzes a staff like a general manager and he saw that the Yankees could be thin from the left side because they have only Alan Embree.</p>
        <p>So, long before Torre thought about Leiter as a possible bullpen weapon, Leiter nominated himself. Of course, that should not surprise anyone who knows him. Leiter loves to talk and Leiter is also one of Leiter's favorite topics.</p>
        <p>''He's not boring,'' Torre said. ''He's got lots to share.''</p>
        <p>Leiter says he can be a left-handed specialist because he has limited left-handed batters to 9 hits in 45 at-bats for a .200 batting average with the Yankees. Embree has allowed 3 hits in 10 at-bats (.300) against lefties.</p>
        <p>Leiter habitually throws lots of pitches and extends counts -- death knells for a reliever -- but Torre says Leiter would adjust and is ''capable of throwing strikes any time he wants.'' Leiter has pitched 411 games, but only 31 in relief.</p>
        <p>''Whatever is ahead of me, I'll do,'' Leiter said. He paused and, like any lifelong starter, added: ''I like starting. It's pretty cool.''</p>
        <p>With Randy Johnson, Mike Mussina, Jaret Wright and Shawn Chacon ahead of Leiter in the rotation and with the possibility that Chien-Ming Wang will return in September, Leiter's chances of being one of the starters on a possible playoff roster are remote. Still, Torre keeps praising Leiter and said Leiter's effort last night made him ''feel good.''</p>
        <p>Leiter has been decent, not overwhelming, as a starter. His best start with the Yankees was his first one, when he stopped the Boston Red Sox, 5-3. His second-best outing might have been last night, when he allowed three runs in seven-plus innings. Leiter is 3-3 with a 4.68 earned run average since coming to New York.</p>
        <p>Even if Leiter and the Yankees fail to reach the postseason, Leiter said he was much more content than he was five weeks ago. As Leiter's season with the Marlins deteriorated, he feared an embarrassing finish to his solid career. Not anymore.</p>
        <p>''If this is the way it ends, that's O.K.,'' he said. ''At least I'll be wearing this cap when I'm done.''</p>
