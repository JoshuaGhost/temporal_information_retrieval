        <p>Reaching for a diplomatic leader to help shore up its finances and to repair its troubled image, the wealthy J. Paul Getty Trust on Monday named Michael Brand, director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, as the new director of its museum.</p>
        <p>The job had been vacant since last October, when Deborah Gribbon resigned as director after clashes with Barry Munitz, the president of the Getty Trust, which controls the museum. California officials are meanwhile investigating the museum's spending to determine whether it has violated its tax-exempt status, and the Italian authorities have brought charges of art theft against its chief curator of antiquities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand, a native of Australia and an expert on Indian art and architecture, inherits a museum with a $5 billion endowment and world-class collections of antiquities, photography and illuminated manuscripts. Many in the art world, however, consider its other artistic holdings, though extensive, to lack a strong aesthetic vision and identity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand will assume significant fund-raising duties that neither of his predecessors had, Mr. Munitz said. Until recently, the Getty Trust has not had to raise money and has simply bought many of the objects it coveted. But with the trust's investment income shrinking, museum expenses rising and prices of art soaring, the trust and museum have for the first time begun to seek donations of money and art objects, he said.</p>
        <p>That task will fall largely to Mr. Brand, Mr. Munitz said.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental burden should rest with the museum director supported by trust president, not the other way around,'' he said. ''That said, we're not going to look like other museums -- we're not going to have a capital campaign or build an endowment or offer eight levels of memberships. But we are selectively going to ask people for help.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand, 47, will oversee the Getty Center in Los Angeles as well as the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif., which houses many of the Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities that were a passion of the museum's namesake, J. Paul Getty, the oil magnate. The villa is scheduled to reopen early next year after a complete renovation.</p>
        <p>In accepting the appointment, Mr. Brand said that he hoped not only to add to the museum's collection but also to make the center more accessible to the public. ''I am looking forward to further building the Getty's renowned collection and to further expanding the way we use it as the central part of our mission of outreach and service to our various communities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Munitz said that Mr. Brand was the first choice among four finalists identified by the museum's board and search committee. He declined to name the other candidates but said that none of the serious contenders for the post turned the Getty down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Munitz said that Mr. Brand's background made him a good fit for a potential shift in orientation by the museum to the art and cultures of Asia and Latin America.</p>
        <p>''Because of his own background,'' Mr. Munitz said of Mr. Brand, ''I think you'll see a more aggressive reaching out to the south and the west -- to Asia and Latin America. Rather than our peers and our measure being the East Coast and Europe, we have turned the compass needle a little bit.''</p>
        <p>As director of the Getty Museum, Mr. Brand will report directly to Mr. Munitz, who is also chief executive officer of the Getty Trust and overseer of its various components, which include the museum, an art conservation institute, a research arm and a grant-making foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Munitz has come under fire in recent months after a series of articles in The Los Angeles Times detailed his $1 million compensation package and his lavish spending. The California attorney general's office is looking into whether the Getty Trust's spending violated its federal and state tax exemptions. The state inquiry will also cover an investigation in Italy of the Getty Museum's acquisitions of a number of ancient artifacts that authorities suspect may have been stolen. The Getty's curator of antiquities, Marion True, goes on trial in Rome in November on charges of conspiring to receive illegally exported artworks.</p>
        <p>The various inquiries and the acrimonious departure of Ms. Gribbon last fall have taken a toll on morale at the museum. But Mr. Munitz said that Mr. Brand was unconcerned about the turmoil and did not hesitate to accept the job.</p>
        <p>''To get our strongest candidate with all of the noise out there tells you something about how our situation is viewed by professionals in the field,'' Mr. Munitz said. He said that the museum staff received Mr. Brand warmly when he introduced him on Monday morning. ''There was a very warm applauding reception,'' Mr. Munitz said. ''Nobody stood up and asked us if we were out of our minds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand's only concern before accepting the job, Mr. Munitz said, was the cost of housing in Los Angeles, which is significantly higher than in Richmond, Va., where he, his wife and two children now live. Mr. Munitz said he hoped the trustees would approve the purchase of a home for the new director, or a substantial housing allowance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gribbon, the previous Getty Museum director, said she had worked with Mr. Brand on occasion and considered him well qualified for the position. She declined to discuss the challenges he faced and would not talk about continuing restiveness among at least some members of the museum's senior staff.</p>
        <p>''He is coming to a museum with a truly exceptional staff and exceptional resources, and by that I don't mean just financial resources,'' she said. ''It's a dynamic environment where more things are possible than in a more narrowly defined museum.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gribbon's predecessor as director of the museum, John Walsh, said that Mr. Brand's chief task was to make the collections worthy of the museum's huge endowment and its magnificent facilities in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and in Malibu.</p>
        <p>''The challenge of the job is to make the collections much greater,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''There's more to do, of course, to make the museum even more effective for the public, but it all starts with the collections.''</p>
        <p>As a senior curator at the Queensland Art Gallery in Brisbane, Australia, Mr. Brand oversaw the growth of the gallery's collection of contemporary Asian art, now considered one of the best in the world. He is the co-author of a book about Indian art that accompanied a 1985 exhibition at the Asia Society in New York.</p>
