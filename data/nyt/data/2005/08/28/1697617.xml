        <p>Kate and Laura Mulleavy are excited to be excited. A conversation with the Mulleavys -- the sisters behind Rodarte, the year-old California label that's set to show in New York next month -- is an exercise in connecting the dots between Kate Moss, James Joyce, the Temple of Dendur and Clover the orphaned rhino. Their first collection was championed by Cameron Silver, who allowed the girls to use his store, Decades, in Los Angeles, to show Anna Wintour their old-Hollywood-style dresses. They scored a Women's Wear Daily cover, and orders came in from the likes of Kirna Zabête in New York. But Kate and Laura remain charmingly free of pretension. Quite the opposite: how many fashion players do you know who get caught running in museums? Which all goes back to their exotic provenance. To call the sisters and their family the Royal Tenenbaums of Fashion is not an overstatement.</p>
        <p>The Mulleavy sisters' first, entirely improvised marketing effort (they are self-taught in all aspects of the business) was the creation of 30 handmade paper dolls, each delivered with a paper armoire containing seven paper Rodarte dresses.</p>
        <p>''Listening to Nirvana was the first time I understood why I tend to go for Tolstoy,'' Kate says of the grunge band's first album, ''Bleach,'' which she describes as extravagantly minimal. ''But what I really find interesting is Hemingway.''</p>
        <p>''Our idea for our spring collection is memories of winter,'' Laura says about their first presentation, to take place during New York's fashion week. One inspiration is this 1973 photograph of their parents' car in Death Valley, dusted with snow.</p>
        <p>Their uncle George Rodart is an artist in New York who currently works in aluminum. A cousin, Greg Mullavey (who has moved the E), played Tom Hartman on  ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.'' His father, also Greg, was a coach for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. Another cousin, Father Bartholomew Ruben de la Torre, entered the Order of Preachers after seven years in L.A. seminaries.</p>
        <p>Kate and Laura adore  ''Murder, She Wrote,'' starring Angela Lansbury as a nosy mystery writer who moonlights solving crimes. ''Mysteries are just the best,'' Laura says. ''Kate once had a birthday party that she planned for three months. She wrote her own mystery play, and it was a period piece. She was in third grade.''</p>
        <p>They are champion pen pals. One notable correspondence describes their experience researching Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' and then digresses into a discussion of electric tubes and how much their father loves them: ''He still acts like we don't understand why they are so great and always gives us the big long speech about why tubes are an amazing asset to sound and design.''</p>
        <p>Their most cherished style icon is Charis Wilson, the muse and second wife of Edward Weston. ''Laura and I have always been obsessed with the idea of an untamed, romantic California, and she is the perfect example,'' Kate says.</p>
        <p>''I'm freaking out -- it's even better than I imagined!'' Laura screams after discovering how this souvenir glove from 1824 may have commemorated the Marquis de Lafayette's visit to America. ''Isn't that genius?''</p>
        <p>Laura (left), 25, and Kate (right), 26, live with their parents in Pasadena, Calif., in a cottage at the back of the home that belonged to their grandfather, an engineer on the Manhattan Project. Their grandmother, who lives in the front house with their uncle Billy, is an opera singer. Their father is a former botanist with a specialty in fungal genetics who introduced them to hot-air ballooning and spore photography, which they look forward to interpreting someday as prints. Their mother handmade the line's Peruvian skull necklaces carried by Barneys New York. Rodarte is her family name (the E has come and gone among relatives).</p>
