        <p>On an island that produces 80 percent of North America's cultured mussels and a third of Canada's potatoes, the classic Belgian dish of moules frites (mussels and French fries) seemed like a no-brainer to Garner Quain.</p>
        <p>Thus, in June, Mr. Quain, a 38-year-old chef from Toronto, began serving savory batches of local mussels and French fries at Flex Mussels, a tiny, cedar-shingled building in Summerside, Prince Edward Island.</p>
        <p>Aside from bread and a selection of nonalcoholic beverages, the 27-by-14-foot takeout shack offers only mussels and fries. In this case, however, ''only'' is relative. In his spare, airy, open kitchen, Mr. Quain, below, creates 24 distinct preparations of mussels, each cooked to order in about four minutes in a covered skillet.</p>
        <p>Variations include, mussels Parisienne (Pernod, tarragon, white wine and basil), and mussels Peking (fermented black beans, Chinese barbecued duck and mushroom broth), and even the Wild Turkey, above (roasted corn, green onions, kumquats and bourbon). At $1.22 Canadian to the U.S. dollar, prices range from $6 to $7.50 a pound (typically enough for one), with French fries or bread.</p>
        <p>The fries are hand-cut on the premises and twice-fried in the classic French manner. Orders are served in Styrofoam take-out trays, for eating at the three picnic tables and a counter outside, or elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quain also sells make-your-own kits -- containers of live mussels, prepared sauce and directions for cooking. The prices are the same as for cooked orders. ''Cooked mussels just don't travel that well,'' Mr. Quain said.</p>
        <p>Aside from island-farmed mussels and spuds, Mr. Quain said that he used as many local products as possible, including herbs and root vegetables. The barbecued duck comes from a nearby Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quain, who learned to cook at such places as the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver, and Canoe in Toronto, said that while he was thrilled to have his own restaurant, there's a down side. ''I can't quite believe,'' he said, ''that at at 38 I'm saying, 'You want fries with that?'''</p>
        <p>Flex Mussels is at 175 Harbour Drive, Spinnakers' Landing, Summerside; (902) 954-0022; www.flexmussels.com. Open daily 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. (till 5 p.m. after Sept. 5). Closes for the season Sept. 18.  MARIALISA CALTA</p>
