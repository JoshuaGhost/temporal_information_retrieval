        <p>Thornfree Raspberries</p>
        <p>Q. Can you identify a shrub I found near railroad tracks in northern New Jersey? The fruit looks temptingly like raspberries but the leaves are soft and rounded, not tough and deeply cut like raspberry leaves. And although the stems are sort of hairy they do not have thorns.</p>
        <p>A. Your find is almost surely purple flowering raspberry, aka fragrant thimbleberry, Rubus odoratus. This hardy, handsome native grows wild from Nova Scotia to Georgia, and it is also popular with landscape gardeners, who use it for informal hedging.</p>

        <p>Thornfree Raspberries</p>
        <p>Q. Can you identify a shrub I found near railroad tracks in northern New Jersey? The fruit looks temptingly like raspberries but the leaves are soft and rounded, not tough and deeply cut like raspberry leaves. And although the stems are sort of hairy they do not have thorns.</p>
        <p>A. Your find is almost surely purple flowering raspberry, aka fragrant thimbleberry, Rubus odoratus. This hardy, handsome native grows wild from Nova Scotia to Georgia, and it is also popular with landscape gardeners, who use it for informal hedging.</p>
        <p>It is distinguished from other brambles not only by those leaves and stems but also by its flowers. They are larger than average, bloom almost all summer, and are typically pink to purple instead of plain white.</p>
        <p>Although they are usually described as fragrant, their perfume is pretty faint for a plant called odoratus. (It is said that a strong smell of cedar is released when you crush the stems, but I never get much more than a whiff.)</p>
        <p>And unlike the fruits of common raspberries or of true thimbleberry, R. parviflorus, those of the purple flowered kind are less tasty than they look. There is not much juice in them and calling their flavor insipid would be kind.</p>
        <p>On the good side, birds adore them and bugs, by and large, do not.</p>
        <p>It is best to wait until fall to plant shrubs, but you could prepare a place now. Sources include Tripple Brook Farm, (413)527-4626 or tripplebrookfarm.com, and Sandy Mush Herb Nursery (828)683-2014 or sandymushherbs.com.</p>
        <p>Rhubarb as Bug Repellent?</p>
        <p>Q. I have been told rhubarb leaves are poisonous, which suggests they are immune to insects. That seems to be true in spring, but not in summer. Does heat destroy the plant's insect resistance?</p>
        <p>A. Rhubarb leaves are vulnerable by the time summer is hot, but the only thing they have lost is their youth. The poison, oxalic acid, is still there. It is simply that the insects do not care.</p>
        <p>Oxalic acid can kill mammals if they eat enough of it, and although it would take a mighty big salad to provide a deadly dose, rhubarb leaves do contain quite a bit. In short, insects can eat a lot of things you can't.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 11, 2005, Thursday</p>
        <p>Thornless Raspberry, Too</p>
        <p>Last Thursday's column described purple flowering raspberry (Rubus odoratus), a thornless native species with soft round leaves. Because the same habitats often support the nonnative wineberry (R. phoenicolasius), it should have been described as well. Wineberry has white, not purple, flowers; rougher, more deeply cut leaves; and far more invasive habits. The fruits of both are edible. Wineberry's are larger and tastier</p>
