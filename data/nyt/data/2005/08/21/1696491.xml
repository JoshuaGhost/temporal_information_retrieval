        <p>Jason Giambi has exceptional strike-zone judgment, and he rarely takes a third strike. When he did in the fourth inning Saturday, he uncharacteristically argued the call, pointing at the home-plate umpire, Larry Vanover.</p>
        <p>There was more going on than a questionable call. Earlier in the at-bat, Giambi bruised his right calf with a foul ball. Tony Womack replaced Giambi at designated hitter and may do so again Sunday.</p>

        <p>CHICAGO, Aug. 20 - Jason Giambi has exceptional strike-zone judgment, and he rarely takes a third strike. When he did in the fourth inning Saturday, he uncharacteristically argued the call, pointing at the home-plate umpire, Larry Vanover.</p>

        <p>Jason Giambi has exceptional strike-zone judgment, and he rarely takes a third strike. When he did in the fourth inning Saturday, he uncharacteristically argued the call, pointing at the home-plate umpire, Larry Vanover.</p>
        <p>There was more going on than a questionable call. Earlier in the at-bat, Giambi bruised his right calf with a foul ball. Tony Womack replaced Giambi at designated hitter and may do so again Sunday.</p>
        <p>''The way he was limping after the game, I'd say he's doubtful for tomorrow,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>The strikeout also brought Giambi's slump to 1 for 28. He is hitless in 11 at-bats on this trip, and his average has fallen to .269, his lowest since July 5.</p>
        <p>Giambi had left U.S. Cellular Field by the time reporters entered the clubhouse after the game, but Torre said that he thought Giambi was too anxious at the plate. Arguing the third strike seemed to highlight that.</p>
        <p>''He was frustrated,'' Torre said. ''He thought he was called out on a bad ball. But that goes with the fact that, like the White Sox are frustrated because they've lost a few games, he hasn't gotten many hits lately. I think that's the same type of result.''</p>
        <p>A Thousand Hits for Posada</p>
        <p>Jorge Posada got his 1,000th career hit, on a ground-rule double that bounced over the right-field fence in the seventh inning. But the Yankees could not persuade the fan who caught the ball to give it to Posada.</p>
        <p>''The guy didn't help me out,'' Posada said. ''He was not going to give it up.''</p>
        <p>Rick Cerrone, the Yankees' director for media relations, said the team offered the fan an autographed bat and ball. But Cerrone said the fan insisted on a ''significant sum of money,'' and the Yankees would not make the deal.</p>
        <p>Flaherty Gets the Nod</p>
        <p>John Flaherty will catch Randy Johnson on Sunday for the 13th time this season. In 12 games with Flaherty, Johnson is 6-1 with a 3.84 earned run average. In 13 games with Jorge Posada, he is 5-6 with a 4.55 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre said Flaherty had a better feel for Johnson's mechanics, which often need adjusting during games. Flaherty stays on Johnson about keeping his arm angle high, and the results have usually been good.</p>
        <p>''We're not hurting Jorge's feelings, because he seems to understand,'' Torre said. ''Because Randy is so big, if things get out of rhythm a little bit, you can pick it up if you see him a lot.''</p>
        <p>Flaherty has caught all but one of Johnson's starts since June 11.</p>
        <p>White Sox Salute the Beatles</p>
        <p>The former Beatles drummer Pete Best threw out the first pitch Saturday as part of the White Sox' weekend tribute to the band, which played two shows at Comiskey Park on Aug. 20, 1965. Best played the drums with a Beatles tribute band outside U.S. Cellular Field before Saturday's game.</p>
        <p>Not the Top Choice</p>
        <p>The Yankees had shown interest in signing the veteran left-hander Kirk Rueter, who was released by San Francisco on Friday, to a minor league contract.</p>
        <p>But his agent, Tommy Tanzer, said Saturday that Rueter, 34, who is 2-7 this season with a 5.95 E.R.A., preferred to sign a major league deal with a contending team in the National League.</p>
