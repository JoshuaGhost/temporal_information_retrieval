        <p>To keep abreast of changes in the health-care industry, Hofstra University in Hempstead and the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System have developed two new master's of business administration programs. One has a concentration in health-services management and the other in quality management.</p>
        <p>Herman A. Berliner, the university's provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, said that Hofstra had long considered introducing a master's program in health-services management and that it decided to do it after North Shore-L.I.J. suggested that they team up for a master's in quality management.</p>

        <p>Michael J. Dowling, North Shore-L.I.J.'s president and chief executive, said in a statement that tremendous changes in the health-care industry in the last decade had caused its institutions to rethink the way they deliver services.</p>
        <p>''Health-care executives need to have the skill sets to address both the service and business dynamic, while also establishing an organizational culture in which patient safety is centermost in all business and policy decisions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Faculty members from the university and North Shore-L.I.J. will teach the courses at the Frank G. Zarb School of Business at Hofstra.</p>
