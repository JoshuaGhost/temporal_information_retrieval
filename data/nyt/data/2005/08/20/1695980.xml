        <p>ENERGY prices have started to drag on the economy. Or they haven't yet. The housing market is a bubble that is really poised to pop. Or it's not. As with many questions about the economy, it depends on who is being asked.</p>
        <p>The federal budget deficit is another example. Congressional budget forecasters say the federal government is likely to overspend its income by less than previously estimated this year, but few agree whether that is a one-time quirk or the start of a trend.</p>
        <p>This much is for certain: As the summer travel season begins to wind down, some airlines will again be pushed to the brink of bankruptcy, and perhaps beyond.</p>
        <p>OUT OF GAS? -- As oil prices ticked up quicker than the ''total sale'' dial on a gas pump, there were signs that higher energy costs were starting to pinch some parts of the economy. Wal-Mart, a harbinger of consumer spending, blamed high oil prices for its weak profit report, saying that customers have less to spend after filling their cars' tanks. Airlines howled at the latest jump in jet fuel prices, and fretted over waning inventories that threatened spot shortages -- at any price -- in some areas.</p>
        <p>Over all, consumer prices shot up in July at the fastest rate in three months, affirming the Federal Reserve's decision to continue raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation in check, even if that means reining in economic growth.</p>
        <p>And yet, some economists said that the economy was absorbing higher energy prices fairly well, and that in any case it is less dependent on energy than it was a generation ago. Excluding energy costs, for example, consumer prices are rising at a modest 2.2 percent annual rate, while industrial production continues to expand and the economy is forecast to grow.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the overall effect of higher energy prices, consumers should prepare to pay more for gasoline, heating oil and natural gas in the fall and winter. Contracts for the delivery of these commodities over the next six months are still trading higher than current prices, they said.</p>
        <p>STILL STRONG -- One area of the economy that remains remarkably robust is the housing market. One widely watched measure of that market -- housing starts, or the number of houses that developers start to build in a particular month -- declined slightly in July, but was still 2.8 percent higher than a year ago, the Commerce Department reported.</p>
        <p>Even more encouraging, the number of permits issued for future residential construction, an indicator of where the market is headed, suggests that the housing market is maintaining some momentum. The number of permits issued last month was 1.6 percent more than in June, and 2.5 percent more than in July 2004.</p>
        <p>In some areas, particularly the once white-hot markets in the West and near Washington, D.C., home sales appear to be slowing and prices leveling off, according to regional statistics and real estate agents. At the same time, however, activity still seems to be picking up in the South.</p>
        <p>Economists said they expected home sales and construction to remain strong until mortgage rates, which remain near historic lows, rise by at least half a percentage point. A tide of foreign investment has helped keep rates low by providing an ample supply of capital for lenders.</p>
        <p>REFRAIN OF PAIN -- How bad off are some of the old-line airlines, even now? Consider this: Delta Air Lines, which is losing hundreds of million of dollars each month, now has to set aside hundreds of millions more in reserve, to assuage its skittish processor of credit card payments.</p>
        <p>The processor is worried the airline could tumble into bankruptcy court, leaving it liable to reimburse tens of thousands of stranded travelers. (The airline had recently started to seek the financing it would need if it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.)</p>
        <p>Delta, the third-largest domestic airline behind American and United, had about $1.7 billion in cash on hand at the end of June, according to regulatory filings. But its short-term obligations are even greater, so to raise cash it sold one part of its business -- Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional carrier -- for something approaching a fire-sale price. Other units are also up for sale.</p>
        <p>Along with raising a reserve for its credit card processor, Delta must make $135 million in pension contributions by the end of the year. It also faces $100 million in debt payments this quarter, and another $335 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>A HOLE LESS DEEP -- Thanks to an unexpected surge in corporate income tax payments, the federal deficit may be as little as $331 billion this year, not the $412 billion forecast earlier, the Congressional Budget Office said. That's the good news.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that $331 billion would still be the third-biggest deficit ever, and Congress has increased spending significantly since the budget office made its last official forecast in March. (Federal subsidies paid to farmers, for example, doubled to almost $18 billion.) The agency now foresees annual deficits totaling $2.1 trillion from 2006 to 2015. That is more than double the total of $980 billion forecast in March.</p>
        <p>President Bush's plan to extend tax cuts beyond 2011 could increase future deficits by more than $250 billion a year from 2012 to 2015, the budget office said. Assuming permanent cuts, the cumulative deficit for the coming decade would balloon to $3.4 trillion.</p>
        <p>FRAUD WATCH -- Just when it seemed that the river of corporate fraud indictments might be drying up, a federal prosecutor filed charges against F. David Radler, the former publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times, and Mark Kipnis, who was general counsel of the newspaper's owner, Hollinger International.</p>
        <p>Speculation quickly focused on the fate of their former boss, Conrad M. Black, a native of Canada who was made a life peer in England after building his newspaper empire, which at one point was the world's third largest by circulation. He was not indicted, but the Securities and Exchange Commission sued him last November, accusing him and Mr. Radler of diverting $85 million from the publicly traded Hollinger International through self-dealing transactions.</p>
        <p>Hollinger International's directors have also sued Lord Black -- as well as several others, including his wife, Barbara Amiel, a former director and Hollinger International executive -- accusing them of siphoning more than $300 million from the company. In interviews and court filings, Lord Black has previously said that the company's board authorized any money he took out of the company.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors are negotiating a plea deal with Mr. Radler, whose arraignment date has not been set. That he is negotiating a deal at all has fueled speculation that Lord Black may yet become involved in the criminal investigation.</p>
