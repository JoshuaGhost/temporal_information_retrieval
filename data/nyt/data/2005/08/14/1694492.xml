        <p>THE GOOD PRIEST'S SON</p>
        <p>By Reynolds Price.</p>
        <p>278 pp. Scribner. $26.</p>
        <p>REYNOLDS PRICE'S latest book is, unabashedly, his 9/11 novel: it opens on an airplane on that fateful day, when the protagonist, 53-year-old Mabry Kincaid, is returning to New York from Europe. The plane is diverted to Halifax; Mabry realizes that his downtown apartment will be uninhabitable and proceeds instead to visit his father, the Rev. Tasker Kincaid, the ''good priest'' of the title, in the small town of Wells, N.C.</p>
        <p>The World Trade Center disaster looms in the background throughout the narrative, and in the foreground, when Mabry returns briefly to New York and visits ground zero. But its apocalyptic weight seems almost extraneous, given the midlife tumult into which Mabry is already cast. He has recently nursed his estranged wife, Frances, to her death, and is newly rich as a result of her will. His daughter, Charlotte, with whom his relations have long been strained, is making conciliatory overtures. His elderly father, a widowed Episcopal priest, is in failing health, having shattered his leg in a fall. And Mabry himself is awaiting the final diagnosis of an array of physical symptoms that suggest he has multiple sclerosis. As if this weren't enough, he also has in his possession a small painting whose innocuous surface may hide an original van Gogh.</p>
        <p>Mabry is a private art conservator (''the gent you hire, if you're rich enough to have a collection of your own or are in a hot rush to get your great-grandmother's awful portrait cleaned before your pregnant daughter's wedding, just to show off your few blameless ancestors to the reception guests'') and had been asked by a client to retrieve the painting from a hotel in Paris. The client, however, works in the World Trade Center and is presumed to have perished there, leaving no next of kin and no will.</p>
        <p>Although the novel leads us to expect much of this subplot, it remains something of a red herring in the emotional thick of the book. Instead, Price follows Mabry as he grapples with mortality -- his own, and everyone else's -- through a series of overtly significant encounters and liberating or disturbing confidences, arrayed in near-picaresque procession. Most painful among them is his father's announcement that Mabry's dead brother, Gabriel (killed in a hunting accident at 18), ''was the one human being I ever truly loved.''</p>
        <p>Tasker Kincaid can't be faulted for his honesty; he also tells his surviving son of his sexual indiscretions. But despite these revelations, Mabry's connection to his father is largely vestigial: theirs is a bond of history, or duty, rather than affection. Himself a mass of (avidly confessed) weaknesses -- routine tomcattery chief among them -- Mabry apparently lacks any strong emotional grounding. No person and no place can serve to comfort him over the loss of his Manhattan home and the possible onset of a debilitating illness. His father, in an exhortation as potentially threatening as it is full of concern, urges him to come back to Wells for good: ''You might yet find a soul here, Mabry -- an actual soul for yourself.''</p>
        <p>''The Good Priest's Son'' is thematically rich -- indeed, it is rather bowed by its meanings -- and features many pleasing Southern voices, along with an impeccable depiction of the region's deep-rooted traditions. There are, however, lapses in the prose that may suggest a certain inattention in the post-9/11 rush to record Mabry's story. In an early chapter, as he arrives at his father's house, we are told that ''he could sit here till dark, easily, letting the jangles of a day in the air between Nova Scotia, Baltimore and Raleigh-Durham bake away before he tackled the Reverend Kincaid, guns loaded (doubtless) and in a new wheelchair with an otherwise unknown woman at his side.'' And on the very same page: ''She was holding a broom upright like a battle tool; and her big eyes were drilling the space between them with no apparent effort -- the face was neutral, not smiling or frowning. Would the broom convert, with ease, into a shotgun or sprout with early fall red roses or four-inch thorns?''</p>
        <p>AND yet, despite such striking infelicities, Reynolds Price's seriousness of purpose remains undeniable. He is a writer who addresses life's urgent questions through characters much like ourselves -- fallible, frightened, lonely, seeking comfort, and sometimes even redemption, in the maelstrom. The events of Sept. 11, 2001, create a background thunder perhaps too loud for the distresses of Mabry Kincaid's one insignificant life, but that may be Price's point: even in the face of immense tragedy, each of us must still confront our own small struggles and must try, as Tasker Kincaid puts it, to ''find a soul.''</p>
