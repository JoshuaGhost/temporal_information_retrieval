        <p>Prague Kolektiv, a shop specializing in Czech furniture, glassware and lighting from the 1920's and 30's, opened yesterday in Dumbo, Brooklyn. The owners, below, are Barton Quillen (seated), an American, and Giovanni Negrisin, an Italian, who met in Prague about 10 years ago. Both were collecting pieces from what they saw as a pivotal moment in design: the period in Czech history and culture that fell between the two world wars. ''The whole country was embracing modernity at the time as a way of expressing participation in a new world, a free society,'' Mr. Quillen said.</p>
