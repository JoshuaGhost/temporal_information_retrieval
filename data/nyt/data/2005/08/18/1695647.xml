        <p>Last week, the week after Peter Jennings died of lung cancer, ABC's ''World News Tonight'' was No. 1 in Nielsen's estimates for the first time since June 2004. The broadcast on Aug. 8, the day after Jennings died, drew 10.5 million viewers. Over all, ''World News Tonight'' brought in an average of 8.9 million viewers for the week. NBC's ''Nightly News'' placed second (8.2 million); ''CBS Evening News'' was third (6.3 million).  ESPN2's new nightly show, ''Quite Frankly,'' with the brash host Stephen A. Smith, delivered an average of 232,000 viewers in its first two weeks. The show made its debut on Aug. 1 and has posted lower viewer totals than ESPN2's July average in the time slot, but higher ratings in the male demographics the channel seeks.  CBS won Tuesday night in both viewers and adults 18 to 49. In a two-episode debut, NBC's ''Tommy Lee Goes to College'' drew an average audience of 5.6 million, which didn't come close to CBS's ''Big Brother.''  KATE AURTHUR</p>
