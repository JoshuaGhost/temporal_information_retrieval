        <p>Ninety-four migrants from Ecuador who were trying to reach the United States may have drowned when the flimsy boat they were traveling in sank off Colombia's Pacific coast, the Colombian Navy said Wednesday after nine survivors were rescued.</p>
        <p>The boat was more than 200 miles off the southwest coast of Colombia when it sank in rough water, Rear Adm. Edgar Augusto Cely of the Colombian Navy said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''There were 103 people in the hold, the ocean was rough and the boat was overloaded,'' Admiral Cely said. ''It began to take on water and was unable to maneuver and sunk.''</p>
        <p>Armando Elizalde, captain of the port of Manta in northern Ecuador, told reporters that the sinking probably happened Friday, with the rescues taking place on Tuesday. ''I would like to think that there are still survivors, but there are few possibilities,'' Mr. Elizalde said.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of migrants leave Ecuador each year aboard creaky old fishing boats that for up to $12,000 per head transport them to Central America on the most perilous leg of a long journey to the United States. The passage, which covers more than 1,000 nautical miles from Ecuadorean coves to Central American beaches, can last more than a week.</p>
        <p>The boat that sank had left Esmeraldas, on the northern coast of Ecuador, on Thursday. Colombian authorities said 13 passengers managed to scramble out of the boat and into the ocean, while the rest remained trapped in the hold.</p>
        <p>Admiral Cely said 4 of the 13 probably died. An Ecuadorean fishing boat picked up the nine survivors, seven men and two women, who had survived for four days by clinging to boxes and buoys. They were later transferred to an Ecuadorean Coast Guard vessel and arrived at Manta at 4 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The survivors told the authorities that they were traveling to Guatemala, where the migrants planned to continue north by land. Most of those who drowned, the authorities in Ecuador said, appeared to be from Ecuador's central Andean highlands.</p>
        <p>Colombian and Ecuadorean Navy ships, as well as private fishing vessels, were dispatched for what authorities said would most likely be a fruitless search for survivors.</p>
