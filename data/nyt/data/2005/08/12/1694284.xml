        <p>MEYER--Theodor Henry, 77, passed away after a short but bravely fought battle with cancer at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on August 10. Born in Bern, Switzerland, he attended Le Rosey in Rolle, and lived in Bern and Puttenham, England. Beloved husband for forty years of Claire Meyer, stepfather of the late Claude Van Cura, brother-in-law of Lily Denman and Marie and Joseph Hanley, uncle of Tom Denman, the late Christopher James Hanley, cousin of Julie Ivelaw - Chapman, Sally Greenwood, and Emma and Madeline Greenwood. His bountiful good humor, kindness and gallantry will be profoundly missed by all who knew him. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations in his memory to Dr. Tracey Arnell, Colorectal Surgery, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, 161 Fort Washington Ave., NY, NY 10032. A memorial service will be held at a later date.</p>
