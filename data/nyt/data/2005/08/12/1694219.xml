        <p>When I was in my late teens, I worked for three months during two summers as a bellhop at a luxury hotel in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>Although I didn't have to pay room and board, my monthly paycheck was ridiculously small. I would have never taken the job or earned as much for college during those summers if it hadn't been for the very generous tips most of the guests gave me and my co-workers.</p>

        <p>When I was in my late teens, I worked for three months during two summers as a bellhop at a luxury hotel in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>Although I didn't have to pay room and board, my monthly paycheck was ridiculously small. I would have never taken the job or earned as much for college during those summers if it hadn't been for the very generous tips most of the guests gave me and my co-workers.</p>
        <p>I agree that in restaurants, a service charge added to the bill is often preferable to a tip. But what if the service is really bad?</p>
