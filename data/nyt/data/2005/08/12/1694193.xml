        <p>TO Phil Mickelson, it was ''a pretty easy'' shot. Easy for him, but certainly not for anybody in his gallery near Baltusrol's sixth green. His ball was in the adjacent 17th fairway, and he had to loft it over some towering trees, land it on the green and stop it quickly to have a chance to save a par 4.</p>
        <p>When he pulled that shot off, his ball spinning to within 5 feet of the cup, his gallery roared and rumbled as only a New York gallery can. As he hurried through the gallery to the green, he was swarmed and surrounded and slapped with high-fives.</p>

        <p>TO Phil Mickelson, it was ''a pretty easy'' shot. Easy for him, but certainly not for anybody in his gallery near Baltusrol's sixth green. His ball was in the adjacent 17th fairway, and he had to loft it over some towering trees, land it on the green and stop it quickly to have a chance to save a par 4.</p>
        <p>When he pulled that shot off, his ball spinning to within 5 feet of the cup, his gallery roared and rumbled as only a New York gallery can. As he hurried through the gallery to the green, he was swarmed and surrounded and slapped with high-fives.</p>
        <p>When the cheers finally ceased, he missed the putt. But his gallery still buzzed. And when he completed a three-under-par 67 to share the lead after the first round of the 87th P.G.A. Championship, more cheers followed Mickelson, the 35-year-old lefty from San Diego who has emerged as New York's pro.</p>
        <p>Over the years, other famous golfers have played and won (or lost) in the New York area, from Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen to Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Tiger Woods, but none of them were ever adopted by New York golf nuts the way Phil Mickelson has been.</p>
        <p>They fell in love with him at the 2002 United States Open at Bethpage Black, where he finished second to Woods, and they thought he would win last year's Open at Shinnecock Hills until he three-putted the 17th hole.</p>
        <p>And now, with the P.G.A. Championship here in New Jersey's leafy suburbs about 20 miles west of Times Square, Mickelson is again golf's man of the moment in the New York metropolitan area. And he's lovin' it.</p>
        <p>''I just think the people here are awesome to play in front of, and they support so many great championships, that I really enjoy coming here and playing,'' he said later. ''That was kind of cool there, going through the gallery after hitting right over them.''</p>
        <p>On that 482-yard sixth hole, Mickelson's drive crashed into a tree on the right and fell straight down. Instead of going for the green, he played down the 17th fairway to within 92 yards of the cup.</p>
        <p>''The tree was really not going to affect the shot any, because I left myself far enough back,'' he said. ''It was just a good full L-wedge and I was able to fly it on and spin it back to about 5 feet. It just looked difficult.''</p>
        <p>Despite the missed putt there to go one over par, Mickelson birdied No. 9 and No. 10, and also the 14th and the 18th holes, where he two-putted from 35 feet as Doug Steffen, the Baltusrol pro, watched from behind the green. Mickelson had played here with Steffen in an Aug. 1 practice round.</p>
        <p>''I just tried to pick up some tidbits on some of the greens,'' Mickelson said. ''How some greens break more than it looks.''</p>
        <p>Standing behind the 18th green as Mickelson putted out, Steffen, the pro here the last nine years and earlier an assistant to Bob Ross for four years, talked about how he picked Mickelson two years ago to win this P.G.A. Championship.</p>
        <p>''With his ball flight and his game around the greens, this course is perfect for him,'' Steffen said. ''He can hit that little cut right-to-left shot.''</p>
        <p>During their Aug. 1 practice round, Steffen told Mickelson that the firmer the greens become, the more difficult they are to putt, because then the little subtleties are more likely to throw the putts off line. ''We spent a lot of time talking about the mountain up there behind our Upper Course that adds little breaks to the Lower Course greens that you don't see,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Of all the big-name pros, Mickelson was the only one to ask Steffen about Baltusrol's intricacies that could make a difference come Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I think the scoring is pretty much what I expected,'' Steffen said. ''I thought there might be a 65 or a 66, but a lot of players can play this course. The greens are so big, there are probably 30 guys capable of winning, and I still expect a playoff, because the guys are so jammed up.''</p>
        <p>If the P.G.A.'s three-hole cumulative-score playoff is needed, it will begin on the 194-yard par-3 fourth hole, continue on the 423-yard par-4 fifth and conclude on the 554-yard par-5 18th.</p>
        <p>Keep the fifth hole in mind, because that's one of the three holes, along with the sixth and the 430-yard 15th, where Mickelson's right-to-left tee shots flirt dangerously with the trees on the right.</p>
        <p>''It's not very difficult,'' said Mickelson, who doesn't feel that his left-to-right tee shot suits Baltusrol's Lower Course. ''It's just that I'm going to come very close to those trees on those holes. They set up for a left-to-right shot, and I'm trying to play it a little right-to-left. It's just three shots throughout the round. I'll try to hit it as straight as I can and hopefully catch the left side of the fairway.''</p>
        <p>He did that yesterday, wearing a cap instead of his usual visor -- a black cap at that. But even in a black cap, he's New York's good guy.</p>
        <p>''Through the trees, Phil,'' a New York voice boomed, the man recalling the lofted wedge to the sixth green and extending his right arm as Mickelson walked away from the 18th green. ''You got everybody's hand but mine.''</p>
        <p>Sorry, buddy. Too late. Phil Mickelson was walking faster than a New York minute.</p>
