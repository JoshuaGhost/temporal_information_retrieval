        <p>For decades ''the Arab on the corner'' has been synonymous here with homely down-market grocery stores jammed with fruits and vegetables, wines and liquors, dairy goods and a smattering of candy bars, floral bouquets, canned goods and preserves -- the stuff of late-night shopping sprees when other stores are shuttered.</p>
        <p>The more enduring of these stores have been here for generations, handed to sons by fathers who emigrated, usually from North Africa, in search of French opportunities. But now, for many, the worm is in the apple.</p>
        <p>The bombings in London and Egypt are naturally the city's summer talk, and they have caused discomfort for many of these merchants, in a country that has its share of ethnic tensions, but where they have tried to create a role for themselves. ''It's not good,'' said Abdelaziz Tiouajni on a recent day, as he set apples straight in his store in the northern Ninth Arrondissement. ''So many deaths.''</p>
        <p>But Arab grocers like Mr. Tiouajni face a more immediate, mundane threat. Increasingly, franchised convenience stores are invading their neighborhoods, faceless dealerships lacking physiognomy that stay open seven days a week and boast, thanks to their central buying power, prices well below those of their fragmented competitors.</p>
        <p>''Competition is very severe; my competitors buy as a group,'' said Mr. Tiouajni, 25, who followed his father, Salim, to Paris from the Tunisian island of Djerba two decades ago. His father opened the store -- barely 1,300 square feet of fruits and vegetables gradually giving way to shelves of oil and flour, cereal and wine and liquor -- and Mr. Tiouajni inherited it five years ago, after his father, now 45, opened a fruit store in the southern suburb of Palaiseau.</p>
        <p>''Most stores like these are run by Tunisians and Moroccans,'' he said, making them to Paris much of what the Koreans grocers are to Manhattan. His most profitable goods are the fruit, he said, because of the larger markups.</p>
        <p>The Arab on the corner has always had his poets, defenders and exalters. Several years ago, the French author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt published a novel, ''Monsieur Ibrahim and the Flowers of the Koran,'' a kind of fairy tale of religious harmony in which an elderly Arab grocer befriends a Jewish boy, Moise, nicknamed Momo. When the Arab dies, Momo inherits the store and becomes Mohammed. ''Arab, in the grocery business,'' he muses in the story's closing line, ''means staying open nights and Sundays.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he had a particular Arab grocer in mind, Mr. Schmitt, now 45, replied: ''Yes, when I wrote the story I was living in the Jewish neighborhood around the Rue Bleue -- there was an Arab -- open from 8 in the morning until midnight. I was fascinated, I realized that many Jews felt much closer to the Arab -- someone from the Mediterranean basin -- than to other Jews, say the Ashkenazim,'' the central and northern European Jews. And who was Momo? He paused, then asked, ''Me?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt said he realized that Parisians were drawn to these corner stores because they had ''another rhythm -- no music -- tastes and fragrances of fruits , spices, almonds and pistachio.'' But it was also because their owners seemed tireless. ''An agreeable and pacifying place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The fantasy, fable and warmth surrounding these stores may explain in part the attachment of Mr. Tiouajni's customers, despite the higher prices. If his figs are going for 4.90 euros a kilo, the chain store's price is 4.30; his Proven√ßal melons may go for 3.90, against 1.50 at the competition. ''Our clientele is very loyal,'' he said, searching for reasons for the store's continued success. What did he think of the bombing? ''That's politics,'' he replied. ''That's not my thing.''</p>
        <p>The bombings in London and Egypt are no issue for Maria Pinto, 58, a concierge in a neighborhood apartment building. ''If you want good quality, it's here,'' she said. ''I buy fruit, vegetables -- it's expensive, but it's fresh, clean -- that's very important.''</p>
        <p>Terrorism may cast no shadow, but the menace from the Franprix at the other end of the street is very real. Last year, Franprix, a chain convenience store-cum-grocery that is part of the even bigger Casino foodstuffs group, opened another store, even more gleaming than the first, just down the street. ''Franprix is a wholesaler, our exclusive supplier, so our prices are lower on average, maybe 30 percent,'' said Joachim Amouri, the 36-year-old store manager, explaining the competitive advantage. Fruits and vegetables are delivered to the store daily, and packaged goods and frozen foods twice a week, he said.</p>
        <p>Would Franprix gradually swallow up the Arabs on the corner and turn them into so many Franprixs? No, he replied, because those stores, many little more than deep kiosks, are too small. So would they be forced out of business? He paused, then replied, ''That's part of the rules of the game.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tiouajni acknowledges that business is not as good as it used to be, not only from the chain store competition, but also from an overall slumping French economy that discourages spending. Still, he would never consider buying a franchise himself. Indeed , if he had to begin all over again, he would do as his father did, selling only fruit.</p>
        <p>''It's more profitable,'' he said.</p>
