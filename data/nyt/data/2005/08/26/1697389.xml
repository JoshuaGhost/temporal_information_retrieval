        <p>A federal panel voted yesterday to combine three existing Army, Navy and Air Force bases in New Jersey into a joint ''mega-base'' under one command, but local officials said the move would barely soften the blow from the commission's decision, a day earlier, to close Fort Monmouth and send thousands of jobs to Maryland.</p>

        <p>A federal panel voted yesterday to combine three existing Army, Navy and Air Force bases in New Jersey into a joint ''mega-base'' under one command, but local officials said the move would barely soften the blow from the commission's decision, a day earlier, to close Fort Monmouth and send thousands of jobs to Maryland.</p>
        <p>The action yesterday by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission would combine the efforts of Fort Dix, McGuire Air Force Base and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst under a central commander at McGuire, the largest of the three installations in central New Jersey. Few if any jobs would be added.</p>
        <p>Members of the state's congressional delegation had sought but failed to persuade the commission to include Fort Monmouth in the new joint base, and yesterday they were still reeling and trying to make sense of the decision to close the installation. In particular, they were puzzled by a small caveat introduced into the decision that seemed to offer a sliver of hope that Fort Monmouth could still be kept open.</p>
        <p>The vote on Wednesday to close Fort Monmouth was definitive: 7 to 1. But just before making the decision, the commissioners passed an amendment that said the facility could not be closed until the Army proved that the move would not hurt military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>No one seems clear on how long it might take the Army to meet the required condition. Nor are officials sure of who will make that decision.</p>
        <p>''This kind of amendment looks like a first,'' said Vice Admiral Paul Gaffney, retired, who is president of Monmouth University, a former head of research and development for the Navy and chairman of a commission formed to protect New Jersey bases. ''No one really knows what it means.''</p>
        <p>Officials said they were particularly confounded by the vote-caveat combination because commission members, in their remarks at Wednesday's hearing, seemed to recognize that Army research done at the base -- including work on devices that combat improvised explosive devices in Iraq -- would be disrupted if the Pentagon's proposal to move its operations to Maryland was approved.</p>
        <p>''When we first heard them talking about their concerns, we were thinking this is great, they will vote to keep it open,'' said United States Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat from Monmouth County. ''Then they said, 'We'll close you, but ---- ' I don't know how else to describe it except as strange.''</p>
        <p>''It made no sense,'' said Maria Gatta, mayor of Oceanport, which has jurisdiction over a third of the base's roughly 1,100 acres. ''They adopted all our positions, then turned around and said we're going to close the fort.''</p>
        <p>Officials with the base closing commission did not respond to e-mail and telephone messages seeking clarification.</p>
        <p>The Department of Defense, in its recommendation that the base be closed, said that Fort Monmouth's Communications and Electronics Command should be transferred to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, where research efforts could be consolidated. It estimated that closing Fort Monmouth would save $1 billion, the Army's largest money saver in the current round of proposed realignments. Local advocates dispute the figure.</p>
        <p>If President Bush approves the closure nominations next month, nearly 5,200 jobs, both civilian and military, would be lost at the base. He can makes changes to the list of nominations before submitting it to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but neither the President nor lawmakers are expected to overturn the commission's decisions.</p>
        <p>In another decision announced yesterday, the base commission approved a 600-job expansion at Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, but local businessmen and officials said that would not offset the economic blow to the largely working-class towns near Fort Monmouth. The Department of Defense has estimated that an additional 4,465 jobs would be lost indirectly with the fort's closing.</p>
        <p>Tony Couzo, 55, the owner of Guido's Famous Pizza, a restaurant on Lewis Street, a few blocks from the base's entrance, said that his lunch business could be devastated if his military customers moved on.</p>
        <p>The commission's decision and its additional conditions seemed to only deepen the community's limbo, he said. ''It's tough to be a businessman during a time of uncertainty.''</p>
        <p>Several advocates for the base said that there might still be a chance of keeping the base open -- if they could force the Army to do a detailed review.</p>
        <p>''What we would like to do,'' Mr. Pallone said, ''is go through Congress or the Government Accountability Office and make them set forth some kinds of benchmarks so this isn't open to the Army just writing a perfunctory letter saying we meet all the conditions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pallone, along with other members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation, including Representative Christopher Smith, a Republican, said they were most concerned with Fort Monmouth's role in the war. They said that it was too risky to close the base because several weapons and communication systems were being developed and maintained at the installation.</p>
        <p>A particularly important program based at Fort Monmouth, they said, disrupts the remote controls that are used in Iraq to detonate improvised explosive devices.</p>
        <p>Tim Snyder, a spokesman for Fort Monmouth, said that there are about 80 engineers, in addition to other civilian and military employees, at Fort Monmouth who worked on the system, which is called Warlock.</p>
        <p>He said that the base also developed, bought and maintained a wide range of battlefield communication systems, including radios, cellphones and hand-held devices that use mapping software to identify troop movements and reduce the likelihood of death by friendly fire.</p>
        <p>Still, some officials said they saw no ambiguity in the decision to close the base. ''There was no process or procedure put in place to accommodate the conditions,'' said Gerry Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown,, where most of Fort Monmouth is located. ''I suspect that the final decision was made yesterday and that Fort Monmouth will be closed.''</p>
