        <p>No one could blame the Liberty if it was looking past the Charlotte Sting last night to tomorrow's regular-season finale at Indiana. The Liberty will face the second-place Indiana Fever in the first round of the W.N.B.A. playoffs, which begin next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Sting, which came into last night's game at Madison Square Garden knowing that, win or lose, it would finish the season in last place in the Eastern Conference, played more like the playoff team, defeating the Liberty, 78-66, before 11,509 fans.</p>

        <p>No one could blame the Liberty if it was looking past the Charlotte Sting last night to tomorrow's regular-season finale at Indiana. The Liberty will face the second-place Indiana Fever in the first round of the W.N.B.A. playoffs, which begin next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Sting, which came into last night's game at Madison Square Garden knowing that, win or lose, it would finish the season in last place in the Eastern Conference, played more like the playoff team, defeating the Liberty, 78-66, before 11,509 fans.</p>
        <p>It was the first road victory of the season for Charlotte after 16 straight losses. Sting forward Sheri Sam finished with a game-high 24 points, and added 7 rebounds and 4 assists. Center Tammy Sutton-Brown spent the final 12 minutes of the first half on the bench with two personal fouls, then returned in the second half to score 14 of her 17 points.</p>
        <p>Liberty point guard Becky Hammon scored 15 of her team-high 20 points in the first half to give the Liberty a 36-35 halftime lead. Hammon also had 7 rebounds and 5 assists.</p>
        <p>The Liberty (18-15) did not need to win, having already clinched the No. 3 spot in the playoffs. But coming off an 82-69 overtime loss at Washington on Tuesday, the Liberty did not want to lose its final home game and head to Indiana on Saturday with back-to-back losses.</p>
        <p>''I didn't think we played very well,'' Liberty Coach Pat Coyle said. ''We lost our composure, and this time of year that cannot happen.''</p>
        <p>Sting Coach Muggsy Bogues said that with one game left -- Charlotte (6-27) will play host to the first-place Connecticut Sun tomorrow -- his team was looking ahead.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to get better and build for next year,'' Bogues said. ''Tonight's win was a good win. Any win at the Garden is a good win. We deserved it.''</p>
