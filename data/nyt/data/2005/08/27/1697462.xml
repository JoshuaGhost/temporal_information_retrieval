      <block class="full_text">
        <p>There are few tales in the annals of medicine to rival the recent obituaries of Hamilton Naki, hailed as the unschooled and penniless black laborer who in 1967 secretly helped Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard perform the world's first heart transplant operation.</p>
        <p>Barred by apartheid from sharing the global acclaim for Dr. Barnard's feat, he won it only in death.</p>
        <p>The New York Times said Mr. Naki's skills were so esteemed that medical authorities ''quietly looked the other way'' despite his black skin. The Spanish newspaper El País called him ''el héroe clandestino.'' In an editorial, The Sydney Morning Herald wrote, ''Most of us are so blessed by relative privilege that the story of Hamilton Naki seems like an outrageous fiction.''</p>
        <p>Alas, it is. Much of it, anyway.</p>
        <p>This much is true: Mr. Naki, who was said to be 78 when he died on May 29 in a black township in Cape Town, was a skilled self-taught surgeon, versed in the argot and techniques of transplants despite leaving school at 14. He was held in great regard by Dr. Barnard and other white colleagues at the University of Cape Town, where he worked for Dr. Barnard at the time of the historic transplant.</p>
        <p>But he did not extract the heart used in the transplant, given to Louis Washkansky, a 55-year-old diabetic, as many accounts had it. At the time, Mr. Naki was not even in Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, where the surgery took place, according to former colleagues. His considerable surgical skills were limited to experimental work on pigs and dogs, and even his greatest admirers say he would not have been allowed to work on humans.</p>
        <p>Also, he was not a poor gardener at the university, as his obituaries reported, but a top-level laboratory assistant, paid a commensurate salary. He did not die penniless, either.</p>
        <p>How he became accepted by The Times and much of the global media as a world-class transplant surgeon in gardener's clothing is not at all clear. Some say Mr. Naki amplified his story, confusing myth and reality in his dotage. Others say an account in the British newspaper The Guardian of his pioneering role, which apparently went unchallenged for at least two years, seemed too authentic to require further checking.</p>
        <p>''I think it probably grew of its own,'' said Rosemary Hickman, herself a skilled surgeon who worked with Mr. Naki for nearly 30 years. ''He was an honest man and he wouldn't have made that claim. I don't know where it came from.''</p>
        <p>It might still be gospel had not the British newsmagazine The Economist last month retracted its own graceful obituary of Mr. Naki, which it stated was based on interviews ''in his own words.'' ''His role was gradually embellished in post-apartheid, black-ruled South Africa,'' the magazine wrote. ''By the end, he gradually came to believe it.''</p>
        <p>If so, that is a shame, for Mr. Naki's true story is remarkable in its own right. By all accounts, Mr. Naki came from rural South Africa to the University of Cape Town in his late teens, landing a laborer's job, apparently tending tennis courts or hockey fields.</p>
        <p>At some point, the university's most eminent surgeon, a German expatriate named Robert Goetz, ''needed a pair of hands in an experiment, looked out the door of the lab and said 'hey' to the first person he saw, and that was Hamilton,'' Dr. Hickman said Friday in a telephone interview. ''That was the start of an extraordinary collaboration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Naki was a keen observer. Hampered though he was by only a sixth-grade education, he learned from Dr. Goetz how to anesthetize animals for experimental surgery and soon became adept in assisting operations. When Dr. Goetz left, Dr. Barnard adopted Mr. Naki as his laboratory assistant.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, Mr. Naki moved to the university's J.S. Marais Surgical Laboratory. He was an assistant to Dr. Hickman, an associate professor and leader of the laboratory's surgical team, into the 1990's.</p>
        <p>No one disputes that Mr. Naki's considerable skills were limited to work on pigs and dogs, where transplant techniques were being perfected at the time. ''I was there in '67 and '68, working with him on transplanting pigs' livers,'' David Dent, the acting dean of the university's health sciences faculty, said in a telephone interview on Friday.</p>
        <p>''He had a very good hand,'' Mr. Dent said. ''But he never went to the hospital, or into the hospital, or saw a human. No technician goes into a hospital.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hickman worked closely with Mr. Naki from 1967 through 1995, when she retired. She said he had grown into a trustworthy surgeon and a skilled anatomist, able to begin surgery in her absence, to point out anomalies in the animals being worked on, and to complete operations when necessary. Mr. Naki knew the technical terms for anatomical features, was intimately familiar with the machinery of surgery and had the skill to perform most if not all of the surgical techniques needed for animal transplants, she said.</p>
        <p>Transplants, whether performed on animals or humans, are ''some of the most complicated surgery there is,'' she said. Dr. Barnard seemed to agree: in interviews shortly before his death, he said Mr. Naki could have performed a heart transplant by himself, had not apartheid denied him the chance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hickman and Mr. Dent said Mr. Naki benefited from the university's reputation as a liberal island in the reactionary South Africa of the day, winning a promotion and a top laboratory assistant's salary. A number of nonwhites were accorded jobs based not on their education, but on their abilities, Dr. Hickman said.</p>
        <p>News accounts of Mr. Naki's career stated flatly that he quietly trained thousands of surgical students during his years as a laboratory aide. Mr. Dent calls that folly. Dr. Hickman says that for close to a decade, Mr. Naki was instrumental in a program in which second-year medical students were trained in anatomy by observing surgery on anesthetized pigs. He also helped teach licensed doctors how to use laparoscopes, used for a form of minimally invasive surgery, after the technique was introduced to South Africa, she said. But the claim that he taught thousands of students appears to be exaggerated, she said.</p>
        <p>As far back as 1993, news accounts suggested that Mr. Naki had played a wider role in heart transplants than previously believed. But reports that he was an actual heart transplant surgeon appear to have emerged more recently, most prominently in a 2003 article in The Guardian. That article stated flatly that in December 1967, ''a team led by Mr. Naki went to work, a 48-hour marathon'' to remove the heart from the donor, an auto accident victim, for transplantation into Mr. Washkansky.</p>
        <p>''I was called one of the backroom boys,'' the article stated. ''They put the white people out front.'' A long, though hardly comprehensive, computer search by a reporter found no explicit claims by Mr. Naki that he had assisted in the transplant beyond that oblique reference.</p>
        <p>A noted Cape Town filmmaker, Dirk de Villiers, who has long planned a film about Dr. Barnard said in a telephone interview on Friday that he was first told of a black man's pioneering role in the transplant in 2002 by a black newspaper editor who refused to name names, saying that he hoped to sell the story to a television producer. Mr. de Villiers, 81, said he soon tracked down Mr. Naki. He never claimed to him that he was Dr. Barnard's assistant in the heart transplant, Mr. de Villiers said. ''But I heard him tell other people that,'' he said, ''and I went to him and said: 'Hami, you're a God-fearing man. You'll have to answer for this when you get up above.' And he just shrugged his shoulders.''</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  August 27, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on June 11 about Hamilton Naki, a black employee of the University of Cape Town, described him as having worked behind the scenes in 1967 to assist Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard in the first human heart transplant.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, British news reports have challenged this description. Further reporting in South Africa by The New York Times has discounted many details of the original account, which was based largely on earlier published reports. The Times should have attributed the account in the obituary more specifically, and should have made further efforts to verify it independently before publication.</p>
        <p>The Times should also have corrected its account more quickly after the initial questions were raised.</p>
        <p>An article describing the revelations about Mr. Naki appears today, on Page A7.</p>
