        <p>FOR Ferran Adrià, a chef who wakes up each workday asking what he can do that has never been done before, potato chips may not seem like the most fertile terrain. But Mr. Adrià has begun helping Lay's develop new recipes that he says contain a touch of the free-spirited philosophy behind his celebrated cuisine.</p>
        <p>The first two flavors, garlic and rosemary, went on sale in Spain in March. But they are tame compared with those coming next year, Mr. Adrià said in a telephone interview.</p>

        <p>FOR Ferran Adrià, a chef who wakes up each workday asking what he can do that has never been done before, potato chips may not seem like the most fertile terrain. But Mr. Adrià has begun helping Lay's develop new recipes that he says contain a touch of the free-spirited philosophy behind his celebrated cuisine.</p>
        <p>The first two flavors, garlic and rosemary, went on sale in Spain in March. But they are tame compared with those coming next year, Mr. Adrià said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>''I cannot tell you what they are, but they are really fun,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The new chips may be innovative, but they are not necessarily complex.</p>
        <p>''The thing about potato chips is that if the flavor is too strong, you get sick of them very quickly,'' Mr. Adrià said. ''These have a very light, natural flavor.''</p>
        <p>The chips, called Lay's Arstesanas, sell for 1.15 euros for 121 grams ($1.40 or so for a bit more than 4 ounces.) On the back is a small photograph of Mr. Adrià.</p>
        <p>The recipes were collaborations between Mr. Adrià and Lay's.</p>
        <p>They represent the latest mass market effort by Mr. Adrià, whose restaurant El Bulli, north of Barcelona, is considered perhaps the most innovative in the world, with reservations often made years in advance.</p>
        <p>He has previously put out a series of olive oils in collaboration with the Borges company. He also opened a fast-food restaurant called Fast Good in Madrid in 2004, aiming to provide good-quality cooking for people in a hurry. A second branch, which will include new dishes and a takeout window, is to open in Madrid in October.</p>
        <p>The chips are available only in Spain, but they will eventually be distributed around the world, Mr. Adrià said.</p>
