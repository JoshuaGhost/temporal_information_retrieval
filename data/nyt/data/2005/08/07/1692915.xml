        <p>HUA HIN, THAILAND</p>
        <p>Well known as a beach resort, Hua Hin is host to the King's Cup Elephant Polo Tournament (2003 match pictured below) from Sept. 5 to 11. The event, the world's largest, draws international competitors, this year including touring rugby players from New Zealand and Australia. Matches are open to spectators without charge.</p>
        <p>The attendant festivities begin with the traditional opening ceremony, presided over by Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand. There will also be a parade, live music and painting demonstrations -- all performed, of course, by elephants.</p>
        <p>Hua Hin is about two and a half hours by limo from the Bangkok airport. There is no domestic air service from Bangkok to Hua Hin. As of late July, flights from New York to Bangkok in time for the tournament started at $798 on Aeroflot.</p>
        <p>VENICE</p>
        <p>The Venice International Film Festival, one of the world's most prestigious and part of the renowned multidisciplinary Venice Biennale, runs from Aug. 31 to Sept. 10. This year features the world premiere of Lasse Hallstrom's ''Casanova.''</p>
        <p>Ticket subscriptions start at about $150, at $1.23 to the euro; check the Web site at www.labiennale.org for updates.</p>
        <p>The Biennale's International Art Exhibition is already under way, and continues until Nov. 6. The exhibition, billed as the world's oldest exhibition of contemporary art, will display work from 70 countries this year, including the first participants from Afghanistan, Morocco and Kyrgyzstan. Tickets are about $18.50, at $1.23 to the euro. (The International Festival of Contemporary Music begins on Sept. 28.)</p>
        <p>As of late July, tickets to Venice from the New York area in time for the film festival began at $815, on SN Brussels Airlines.</p>
        <p>KONA COAST, HAWAII</p>
        <p>Hawaii's official state sport holds its grandest competition, the Queen Liliuokalani Long Distance Canoe Races, the world's largest outrigger canoe race.</p>
        <p>The races (2004 race below) take place on Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 3 and 4; spectators can watch the canoes arrive and prepare for the weekend. On Saturday morning, the day opens with chants and blessings. An excellent spot for watching Saturday's race is Honaunau Bay, where the women paddlers hop out after 18 miles and trade places with the men, who paddle back to Kailua Bay.</p>
        <p>Saturday night, a torchlight parade is followed by a dance, and on Sunday night a luau is open to paddlers and spectators alike. Tickets for the luau, which are expected to cost about $15, will be available at the door or at the King Kamehameha Hotel registration desk.</p>
        <p>As of late July, flights from the New York area to Kona that weekend started at $857 on American Airlines.</p>
