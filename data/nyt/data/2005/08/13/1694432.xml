        <p>After an article in The Star-Ledger suggested that Tiger Woods's caddie, Steve Williams, might have stepped on Woods's ball in the high rough along the 18th fairway Thursday, Woods said Friday that Williams ''wasn't even near it.''</p>
        <p>Woods and Williams looked for Woods's ball next to a gully before Williams spotted it in the rough. Each asked two tournament officials if someone -- a member of the news media or a marshal, perhaps -- might have stepped on it. The officials could not confirm it, and Woods was forced to take a penalty drop.</p>

        <p>''I saw the videotape just like all you guys saw,'' said Woods, who defended Williams. ''He walks three steps closer to actually point out the golf ball, so he wasn't even near it.''</p>
        <p>Woods could have faced disqualification for signing an improper scorecard if officials had ruled that Williams had stepped on the ball without saying anything, according to Reuters.</p>
