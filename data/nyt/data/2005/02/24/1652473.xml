        <p>Marvin Traub, who ran Bloomingdale's from the late 1970's to the early 1990's, has joined Mohan Murjani, a former jeans maker, to run a retail development and consulting business in India. The venture, to be called Murjani Traub India, will have offices in New York and Mumbai. Although Mr. Murjani sold most of the stake he held in Tommy Hilfiger years ago, he kept the rights to distribute Hilfiger in India and opened the first of the Hilfiger boutiques last April. The new venture was scheduled to be announced this morning. Mr. Murjani said recently that he planned to expand his licenses in India to include watches, home furnishings, underwear and fragrances. Mr. Traub, who established his own consulting firm after leaving Bloomingdale's in 1991, will offer advice to retailers considering expanding into India, where the number of malls is soaring, a joint press release said.</p>
