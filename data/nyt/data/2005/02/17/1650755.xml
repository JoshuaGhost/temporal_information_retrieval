        <p>WEILER--Rhoda Goldstone. Age 97 of Palm Beach, FL died peacefully on Wednesday, February 16, 2005. She was married to Sydney Goldstone, an architect and avid golfer, for 36 years until his death in 1970. She later married Theodore Weiler who also predeceased her. She was a graduate of Adelphi College, taught elementary school and worked in her family's business, Miner's Cosmetic Company, both in New York and London. She was a trustee of the Theodore and Renee Weiler Foundation. Her greatest joy was her family; daughters Abby Pelton Popper and Erda G. Erdos; grandchildren Karen, Gail and Michael Erdos, Lisa, Stephen and Nina Pelton, great grandchildren, Ayla, Julian, Rae, Mimi and Charlie. She was a true friend to many, a great hostess, a wonderful gardener and flower arranger-she loved to laugh, was extremely generous and the world's best grandmother. Contributions in her memory may be made to Blythedale Children's Hospital, Valhalla, NY 10595 or WITF Public Radio and Television, 1982 Locust Lane, Harrisburg, PA 17109. A service in celebration of her life will be held at the Chapel in the Woods, Congregation Kol Ami, 252 Soundview Avenue, White Plains, NY 914-949-4717 on Friday, February 18 at noon.</p>
