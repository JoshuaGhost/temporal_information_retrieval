        <p>Carolyn Curiel, in Editorial Notebook column, praises 'The Gates,' public art creation in Central Park by Christo and Jeanne-Claude; holds that installation, streaming along 23 miles of walkways in park, invites interaction and exploration; contends that critics can argue that Central Park does not need fuss, but maybe New Yorkers do, in form of this bright respite (M)</p>

        <p>Few artists can make a global splash like Christo and Jeanne-Claude, who are spouses and collaborators. Their public art creations are not so much displayed as audaciously imposed: installations that employ landscapes and buildings as mannequins and pincushions. They put pink skirts on islands off Florida, silver draping around the Reichstag in Berlin and colorful umbrellas in fields in Southern California and Japan. As a successor to these phenomena, ''The Gates,'' which unfurls today in Central Park, adds another dimension, a certain humanity within the grandeur.</p>
        <p>The artists' earlier inventions were often remote, away from urban areas or other easily accessible settings. The splendor depended on what photographs or aerial video could capture. Not so with ''The Gates.'' For 16 days, ''The Gates'' will be in place, with 7,500 saffron-colored panels hanging above pedestrians like slices of sunlight.</p>

        <p>Few artists can make a global splash like Christo and Jeanne-Claude, who are spouses and collaborators. Their public art creations are not so much displayed as audaciously imposed: installations that employ landscapes and buildings as mannequins and pincushions. They put pink skirts on islands off Florida, silver draping around the Reichstag in Berlin and colorful umbrellas in fields in Southern California and Japan. As a successor to these phenomena, ''The Gates,'' which unfurls today in Central Park, adds another dimension, a certain humanity within the grandeur.</p>
        <p>The artists' earlier inventions were often remote, away from urban areas or other easily accessible settings. The splendor depended on what photographs or aerial video could capture. Not so with ''The Gates.'' For 16 days, ''The Gates'' will be in place, with 7,500 saffron-colored panels hanging above pedestrians like slices of sunlight.</p>
        <p>Streaming along 23 miles of walkways in Central Park -- the most-visited park in the nation's largest city -- the installation invites interaction and exploration. The artists have said the saffron color of the fabric and frames was chosen simply because they like it, but it seems a prompt for meditation and reflection. Still, visitors shouldn't expect a lot of peace and quiet. New Yorkers and tourists are expected to crowd the park, an unusual circumstance in the month of February.</p>
        <p>As with their previous 18 large works, Christo and Jeanne-Claude financed the full cost, some $20 million. They also paid with time and perseverance. It took a quarter-century to realize their vision, which finally won approval after the election of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Only in the last few weeks did the scope of the project become clear, with the frames springing up as if ready for a giant round of croquet.</p>
        <p>On one recent day, crew members hoisted poles into place and took in early reviews from passers-by. One called it an abomination, but others seemed more enthralled. One woman, who described herself as a landscape painter, called the work in progress ''an environmental happening.'' Another woman, on skates and carrying a Bergdorf Goodman bag, tried unsuccessfully to volunteer to help on the spot. In the dead of winter, when sensations can go as numb as uncovered ears, Christo and Jeanne-Claude and their legions of helpers are at the very least succeeding in awakening sentiments.</p>
        <p>Critics can argue that Central Park does not need the fuss. But maybe New Yorkers do, in the form of this bright respite.</p>
