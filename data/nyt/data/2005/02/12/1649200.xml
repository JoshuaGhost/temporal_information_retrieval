      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''Slipstream,'' a handsome but vacuous caper movie, appears tonight on the Sci Fi Channel. It's a bust. With its scattershot tone -- mostly cartoonish, with occasional lapses into a ''Matrix''-style self-seriousness -- the film is meandering and drowsy in spite of abundant gunfire.</p>
        <p>The movie opens with Spirograph shapes waving around, and a voiceover spiel about how weird it would be if time stopped. Stuart Conway (Sean Astin), the one talking, is a schlubby physicist who, like all sci-fi geniuses these days, loves the wormholes, string theory and space-time fabric -- all the unlikely astro-terminology that seems to put humanity millimeters away from time travel.</p>

        <p>''Slipstream,'' a handsome but vacuous caper movie, appears tonight on the Sci Fi Channel. It's a bust. With its scattershot tone -- mostly cartoonish, with occasional lapses into a ''Matrix''-style self-seriousness -- the film is meandering and drowsy in spite of abundant gunfire.</p>
        <p>The movie opens with Spirograph shapes waving around, and a voiceover spiel about how weird it would be if time stopped. Stuart Conway (Sean Astin), the one talking, is a schlubby physicist who, like all sci-fi geniuses these days, loves the wormholes, string theory and space-time fabric -- all the unlikely astro-terminology that seems to put humanity millimeters away from time travel.</p>
        <p>Conway is already there, it turns out. His little video game-cellphone is in fact a Slipstream 2.4, a device that can turn back time.</p>
        <p>And he uses it, first to erase an embarrassing exchange with a sexy bank teller, and then to undo some of the carnage during a bank robbery shootout.</p>
        <p>His troubles aren't over. A duo of flirting F.B.I. agents has been looking for a ''brilliant but annoying'' physicist -- and that's Conway. They follow him into the bank, where the heist, brought off by some punk English thugs, goes bad, and lives are lost. Conway shows his proficiency with his Slipstream device, and the feds are impressed.</p>
        <p>But the day just gets worse. The Anglo evildoers take hostages on a bus; one of the feds dies; and almost the whole cast ends up airborne on a plane that seems sure to crash. It might be possible to start over, except that the Slipstream 2.4 can take us back only 10 minutes reliably; beyond that, things become ''unstable,'' as Conway puts it.</p>
        <p>Maybe, though, in an airplane, if the polarities are</p>
        <p>Oh, why ruin the surprise? It ruins itself. ''Slipstream'' is an airhead movie, with no conviction in its pseudoscience. If it weren't for Sean Astin, with his hobbity charm, there would be nothing to watch here.</p>
        <p>'Slipstream'  Sci Fi, tonight at 9 and tomorrow at 1 a.m., Eastern and Pacific times; tonight at 8 and midnight, Central time.</p>
        <p>Directed by David van Eyssen; David Lancaster and David Bixler, producers; written by Louis Morneau and Phillip Badger; SÃ¶nke Hansen, director of photography; Toby Yates, editor; music by Rob Lord.</p>
        <p>WITH: Sean Astin (Stuart Conway), Vinnie Jones (Winston Briggs) and Ivana Milicevic (Sarah Tanner).</p>
