        <p>When is a Beethoven quartet not a quartet? When it's the Grosse Fuge.</p>
        <p>The piece now known as Op. 133 was originally written as the final movement of Beethoven's 13th quartet, Op. 130. But this great, impassioned, complicated and lengthy musical utterance challenged its first audiences, and Beethoven ultimately replaced it with a shorter last movement more in line with expectations.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it was the Grosse Fuge that concluded the Takacs Quartet's six-concert traversal of all 16 Beethoven string quartets on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall. Having ended the first concert, on Jan. 9, with Op. 130 with its more demure ending, the quartet finished this one with the same piece as it was originally written, with the mammoth fugue forming an emphatic close not just to this work, but also to the whole project.</p>
        <p>The Fuge as well was a fine way to hear what this ensemble is all about. The Takacs, which has also just completed a recorded cycle of the quartets, is very much a group of individuals: four personalities emerge in taut, accomplished playing that focuses more on strong music-making than on perfection -- at least, than on perfection of intonation, since theirs, sometimes surprisingly, took a back seat to the immediacy of what they had to say.</p>
        <p>The Takacs sound is full, deep, throaty. The group is no longer technically Hungarian; only two of the players remain from the original quartet formed in Budapest in 1975. But Central European is a way to describe the quality of warm wood, with rosin flying from the bows, that its playing evokes.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with the seventh quartet, the first of the three Op. 59 quartets, known as ''Razumovsky,'' after their commissioner. The group's elegant, robust playing was augmented in the final movement by a fire alarm bell: a false alarm, fortunately, since hardly anyone in the audience stirred. Listeners were more responsive when the first violinist, Edward Dusinberre, revealed that it was the birthday of the second violinist, Karoly Schranz. They spontaneously broke into ''Happy Birthday.''</p>
        <p>Still, the strongest impression of the concert was the Grosse Fuge. The moment, for instance, when a particularly thorny passage suddenly yielded to a moment of serenity played like a benediction: still water under a golden sunset.</p>
