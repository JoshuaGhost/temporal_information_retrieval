        <p>Step all the way in. Stand clear of the closing doors. But don't expect to hear intelligible subway announcements, especially if your train is delayed or rerouted.</p>
        <p>In more than one-quarter of all subway trips, announcements by conductors are garbled, inaudible or nonexistent, according to an annual survey released yesterday by the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for riders.</p>
        <p>Basic car announcements were made 73 percent of the time in 2004, an increase from 67 percent in 2003, according to the survey, which involved 86 employees and volunteers who made 6,600 trips -- 300 on each of 22 subway lines -- between January 2004 and last month.</p>
        <p>When things go wrong in the subways, however, riders are told little. In 84 percent of the 225 instances of delays or service changes examined during the survey, there was no announcement or an inadequate one.</p>
        <p>''Riders need announcements to get around the system and to cope with delays and reroutings, particularly in the wake of last week's disruptions to the A and C lines,'' said Neysa C. Pranger, a coordinator with the Straphangers Campaign, an arm of the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>The worst announcements were on the J and Z lines. The two lines had intelligible announcements 46 percent of the time. That pair of lines, along with the No. 7, L line and M line, had the greatest deterioration in the quality of announcements since 2003, the survey found.</p>
        <p>The No. 5 train had the best performance, 98 percent. That line mostly draws from a generation of subway cars that were introduced in 1999 and use automated announcements. By comparison, the J and Z lines mostly use cars from a series that dates to 1968-69.</p>
        <p>The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a philanthropic institution, paid for the survey, which has been conducted each year since 1997.</p>
        <p>Officials did not dispute the findings.</p>
        <p>''New York City Transit's subway announcements have benefited from the addition to the fleet of more than 1,800 new-technology subway cars with automated digitized voice announcement,'' the agency, part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in a statement. ''We will continue to stress the timely delivery of delay information to our customers.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Book, a 26-page rule book, urges conductors to be conscientious about announcements. ''They're important, not just for the information they convey, but because good announcements help to create the overall impression that ours is a system that people can trust and on which they can depend,'' the book states.</p>
        <p>Randy Nevels, a transit union official who represents subway conductors, said conductors are hampered by malfunctioning equipment.</p>
        <p>''Public announcement systems are not maintained to any great degree,'' said Mr. Nevels, vice president for rapid transit operations at Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union of America. ''A lot of times you might not even hear the announcement, due to static. The equipment is old.''</p>
