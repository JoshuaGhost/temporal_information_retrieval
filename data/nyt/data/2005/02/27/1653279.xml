        <p>Darryl Strawberry will arrive at spring training on March 7 to impart wisdom to the Mets and to serve as a reminder of the team's last World Series championship, in 1986.</p>
        <p>He is the Mets' career leader in home runs and runs batted in, but his career was derailed by substance abuse. Strawberry, 42, who also survived two bouts with cancer, last played in the majors in 1999.</p>
        <p>''I have a great deal of wisdom about life,'' said Strawberry, who was hired this month to be a special instructor for about one week during spring training. ''I think that's very important to express to younger players. I have a great deal of understanding what it takes to win.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry, along with his former Mets teammates Ron Darling and Sid Fernandez, greeted fans who had purchased season-ticket plans at Shea Stadium yesterday. At 9 o'clock this morning at Shea, they will be joined by three of their 1986 World Series teammates -- Gary Carter, Howard Johnson and Tim Teufel -- to meet fans who buy individual game tickets.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, who was suspended for the 2000 season for failing a drug test and spent almost a year in prison in 2002-3 for violating probation on cocaine possession charges, suggested that the steroids controversy hovering over major league baseball reflected a lack of discipline by some players.</p>
        <p>''Whatever happened to the hard work?'' he said. ''The real hard work, you know, like we did in the 80's. We worked hard and we'd lift weights. We trained ourself and conditioned ourself.''</p>
        <p>Jose Canseco, whose career began in 1985, accuses current and former players of using steroids in a book released this month, ''Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits and How Baseball Got Big.''</p>
        <p>''Canseco was really one of the first guys that you probably knew that was, like, using steroids at that time because you could tell about the difference of sizes each year when he would come back,'' said Strawberry, who added that he was never tempted to use steroids. ''So I think it was more of a show, for the look, more than anything.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry said he had a simple message for the Mets at spring training.</p>
        <p>''I just want to try to let them know winning is fun in New York,'' he said. ''You know, winning is fun. I mean, it is fun! And I think the organization has felt like they have lost that edge on what winning was about.''</p>
        <p>During his 17-year career, Strawberry won a World Series with the Mets in 1986 and was a part-time player for the Yankees when they won titles in 1996, 1998 and 1999. He also played for the Dodgers and the Giants.</p>
        <p>But the Mets, Strawberry said, are his home.</p>
        <p>''This is where everything started for me,'' he said. ''And if you honestly look at it, this is pretty much where I had, you know, the most success.''</p>
