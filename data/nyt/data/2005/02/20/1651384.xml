        <p>Benjamin Genocchio reviews exhibition of works inspired by older source materials on view at Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY; photos (M)</p>

        <p>EVERY work of art is in part made of other works, with a small ingredient called originality and an even smaller one called inspiration mixed in with it. Joel Smith, a curator at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, was reminded of this fact while poking about the collection up here, and decided to put together a modest exhibition illustrating that idea.</p>
        <p>Seductively -- and somewhat misleadingly -- titled ''Second Sight: Originality, Duplicity and the Object,'' the exhibition canvasses three main ways in which artists use other art in their work. Firstly, there is the faithful reproduction or copy, next the creative adaptation, and finally works of interpretation or commentary in which an artist satirizes or imitates another artist's work.</p>

        <p>EVERY work of art is in part made of other works, with a small ingredient called originality and an even smaller one called inspiration mixed in with it. Joel Smith, a curator at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, was reminded of this fact while poking about the collection up here, and decided to put together a modest exhibition illustrating that idea.</p>
        <p>Seductively -- and somewhat misleadingly -- titled ''Second Sight: Originality, Duplicity and the Object,'' the exhibition canvasses three main ways in which artists use other art in their work. Firstly, there is the faithful reproduction or copy, next the creative adaptation, and finally works of interpretation or commentary in which an artist satirizes or imitates another artist's work.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is text-heavy, meaning that it requires a great deal of commitment to fully appreciate the myriad connections between the objects on view. But it is worth it, for here one will discover extraordinary commonalities of artistic technique, subject matter, style, composition and ambition in objects that span centuries, cultures and continents. Exploring the connective tissue of art history, the exhibition invites viewers to look closely at art.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith has paired the exhibits, contrasting source images (in some cases a facsimile of the original famous work of art) with an imitation or copy. It is an edifying format, for it shows the appropriation of earlier images by later artists, and how artists transmit artistic traditions, motifs and subjects from one context to the next. The connections are often surprising.</p>
        <p>Take for instance a photograph by the American social realist photographer Lewis Hine, who is famous for early-20th-century expos√©s of labor exploitation and tenement life in New York City. One of these photographs, ''A Madonna of the Tenements'' (1904), an iconic family portrait, takes its formal inspiration from Raphael's painting ''Madonna of the Chair'' (1513). Hine was attempting to illustrate the simple beauty and nobility of motherhood, and found an appropriate model in the work of his Italian Renaissance precursor.</p>
        <p>This, of course, is not to suggest that Hine's image is somehow less important, original or authentic, for what is often valuable about an artwork is the way the artist transforms the art they draw upon or deal with. Much of Raphael's early painting was indebted to Michelangelo, for instance, just as Michelangelo looked to Greco-Roman art models for his own paintings and sculptures. But like Hine, both artists were able interpret the objects and images they studied and create something new and enlivening.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, however, artists simply sought to copy the work of other artists for study, sale, or for reproduction in another medium. Included here are many kinds of copies, and their originals, from a fine Rembrandt etching, a copy, and copy of the copy, to a pair of near identical paintings by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Charles Fairfax Murray. There are also versions of the circa-second century B.C. Laocoon, a marble group representing the Trojan priest and his two sons being crushed by snakes. It is one of the treasures of classical sculpture.</p>
        <p>Mechanical and, more recently, digital reproduction have increased greatly the capacity to copy images. Showing here for instance are works by Andy Warhol, who made a career out of doing silkscreen copies of television and newspaper images of famous people, and works by the contemporary Brazilian artist Vik Muniz, who takes photographs of other famous photographs that have however been recreated using diamonds, toys and food products like spaghetti, chocolate and salt. Then there is Tim Davis, a newcomer who takes photographs of portions of paintings from odd angles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith has pulled out of collection storage some slightly subaltern genres of art production to illustrate his points. Among the strangest objects is an amateurish c. 1850's painting by an unknown artist after an etching by James Smillie (a well-known banknote engraver) which was also done after a painting by Thomas Cole, ''The Voyage of Life,'' (1839-1840), now hanging in the National Gallery in Washington. How do we know that the painting is a copy of the print? There is no certain way to tell, but details in the painting bear closer resemblance to those in the print than the original painting.</p>
        <p>The exhibition spills into the permanent collection rooms, where Mr. Smith has marked artworks on the walls (including, curiously, a Georges Rouault forgery) that comment on or reference other art. Among them is Gary Schumer's ''Wrapped Vermeer I'' (1989), in which the artist has painted Jan Vermeer's ''The Art of Painting'' (c. 1666) wrapped in a plastic sheet as if ready for transport to a museum exhibition. It is the perfect coda to an exhibition about the ways in which art often refers to other art.</p>
