        <p>AT times I catch myself referring to the Saw Mill, the Bronx River and the Henry Hudson as freeways. Of course, I accept the fact that here in the East they cost money to use, but as a born and bred Californian, I subscribe to the notion that tolls amount to highway robbery.</p>
        <p>When I migrated here and began driving on the parkways, I had to learn to be prepared for the toll plaza in the North Bronx, on the way either to or from Westchester.</p>
        <p>At first I approached my 45-minute-on-a-good-day commute with resentment. It was difficult not to think of it as wasted time. I was being held hostage in a Chevy Malibu. ( I've had much worse. There was a brief period in Los Angeles when my morning's drive would top two and a half hours, and the differences between the freeway and a parking lot seemed minuscule.)</p>
        <p>Soon, though, I learned to appreciate the benefits of the daily treks. They meant listening to plenty of National Public Radio in the morning and appreciating the aesthetics of bubble-gum pop music at night. In the moments that allowed me a daydream, I would gaze out at the brilliant leaves or freshly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, I would be jarred from my reverie by the sight of the boxy tollbooths. I recognized that they were a necessary element in the vast network of commuter options, but those booths infuriated me. As my car would pull to a halt, anywhere from two to six times a day, I would reach over to my wallet bitterly, calculating how much more I was paying in tolls than I had paid for my monthly subway pass in the city.</p>
        <p>I had to remember always to have cash, preferably singles, or face a scowl from the tollbooth worker, who peeled off my change as if I was asking her for a portion of her salary. ''Listen, lady,'' I imagined shouting in a moment of melodrama, ''this is no more of a pain for you than it is for me! At least you are getting paid sitting in that cozy little chair of yours! I'm the one forking over money!''</p>
        <p>I had morphed from an easygoing Angeleno into a curmudgeonly New Yorker. For weeks, the E-ZPass application sat under a pile of coffee cups and newspapers in the passenger seat. My online form had been rejected, some unknowable technological glitch forcing me to fill out a paper form and mail it in. And my annoyance did little to help me overcome my tendency to procrastinate.</p>
        <p>Then, with the knowing slowness of a car pulling into a tollbooth, I began to realize something: My daily drive had become more and more familiar -- not to say monotonous -- and my periodic cash stops not so very onerous. In fact, they had become the highlight of my commute.</p>
        <p>It's unclear whether I was motivated by boredom or my mother's training in good manners, but I began chatting up the men and women who took my money. I learned who was where on what shift, and offered a weary smile every time I passed. Out of fear of receiving threatening honks from the cars behind me, I never did more than exchange perfunctory pleasantries, but I learned to anticipate the easy smiles of the peppier workers and the reluctant grins of the stubbornly grim ones.</p>
        <p>There were the teasing ones, who would rib me for heading home late or ignoring the mountain of junk in the back seat. There were the flirtatious ones, who would compliment my hair or sweater as if they were in a dimly lighted bar, instead of under the fluorescent lights of the Saw Mill. And some seemed not even to need an audience, simply humming to themselves, already beaming by the time I rolled up.</p>
        <p>These toll workers helped me overcome the doldrums. They offered an assurance of contact -- proof that people beat robots or wire bins, adding humanity to an otherwise vacant drive.</p>
        <p>But all the while, I was still doing the math. I knew that I was still spending more with each toll.</p>
        <p>After more than two months of the cash commute, my E-ZPass was delivered, its automatic toll discounts built in. With the white plastic square affixed to my windshield, I was on the path to economic salvation.</p>
        <p>But I have come to see that what I lost had its own special value. As I drove up to a row of booths the other day, I yearned for those shared smiles -- something I never got on the freeway.</p>
