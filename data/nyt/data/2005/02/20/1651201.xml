        <p>Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the yachts at sea.</p>
        <p>There's scarcity in Beverly Hills -- and I'm not talking about talent. The city is experiencing a shortage of human hair, as every starlet in Hollywood has come to depend on hair extensions to give her lackluster mane some oomph (and hide the occasional plastic-surgery scar). The dearth of human hair has led to a spike in prices, especially for tresses from Italy, and even eBay is getting in on the act. As Natalie Martino, of the Art Luna hair salon in Santa Monica, puts it: ''If I find good hair, I have clients who will spend thousands of dollars. Like they say, 'Hair today, gone tomorrow.'''</p>
        <p>In a city where it's all about being connected, the most coveted high-tech toy is the RAZR V3 from Motorola. A user-friendly cell phone, it is the width of a credit card, with a keypad that looks more like a piece of modern art than something you would want to put your Lisa Jachno-manicured fingers on. Those who have it (Gwen Stefani, John Mayer, Gavin Rossdale) brag that they can go out anywhere and never miss a call, even at the Ivy.</p>
        <p>Who says Angelenos couldn't care less about preservation? A group of chic environmentalists is protecting the delicate stiletto from extinction. While New York's well-heeled endure subway grates and manhole covers in the name of style, women in L.A. are mobilizing against a more uphill challenge: grass. ''Beware of the lawn, leave your stilettos at home,'' warned the invitation to a recent lunch for the Natural Resources Defense Council. No word on whether protests are planned against stores carrying the season's must-have flats.</p>
        <p>When fashionistas in my neck of the woods talk about going to ''the shows,'' they're more likely to mean the strip shows in Vegas than the buttoned-up collections in Paris or Milan. As stylists and socialites have begun to invade upscale gentlemen's clubs, there has been a run on Showgirl Supplies, a members-only chain, with shops located in the clubs themselves -- sometimes accessible only through the strippers' dressing rooms! Though the merchandise is not intended for the public, that hasn't stopped the Prada brigade from becoming card-carrying members, for $500 a year (redeemable in products). Once inside, the Versace knockoffs are cheap and the underwear outrageous. Hours are stripper friendly: 6 p.m. to 5 a.m.</p>
        <p>The bold and the spiritual have cooled off on Bikram yoga and are now doing the downward dog to Snoop Dogg. Hip-hop yoga is all the rage in L.A., with actresses and models, even the Olsen twins, beating a path to the Maha yoga center in Brentwood. Maybe you can achieve shanti through Ashanti, but I suspect that devotees of this practice are more interested in getting into knots with the Matthew McConaughey-look-alike instructor.</p>
        <p>These days, everybody is reading Laurie Pike, whose items are so cringe-worthy they're cringe-tastic. Under her direction, LA.com has started two new blogs -- LA.comfidential and Clotheshoarse -- where one gets all the dish on celebrity wardrobe malfunctions. Recently, Pike spotted a German tourist in head-to-toe Escada and followed her into a hotel bathroom. ''She looked like a botanical garden that exploded,'' she says. ''In L.A. you see so many things that are so ridiculous, all you have to do is take a picture and put it on your blog.''</p>
        <p>Forget oxygen facials. At the Anastasia salon, Raya Ruder, lately of Minsk, uses all-natural remedies to maintain Hollywood's unnaturally youthful glow. Ruder rattles off old Russian beauty recipes the way Julia Child used to throw together a souffl√©. ''To shrink a pore: 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of oatmeal and a shredded tomato.''Ruder has a natural bromide for anything you suggest. Want to exfoliate and look bronzed? Take 1 cup of used coffee grounds, ''mix it up with a cup of olive oil and scrub for 5 minutes, then leave on your skin 10 minutes,'' she explains. ''If you do it twice a week your skin will get a gold color.'' Yumy, ummy.</p>
