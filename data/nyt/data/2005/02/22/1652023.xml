        <p>JOHAN SANTANA, Carlos Silva and Juan Rincon went through their first spring training workout for the Minnesota Twins yesterday, but they couldn't help thinking about their parents and other family members back home in Venezuela.</p>
        <p>Just three days earlier, Maura Villarreal, the mother of Ugueth Urbina, a Venezuelan relief pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, was rescued from kidnappers in a jungle after they had held her captive for nearly six months.</p>
        <p>Kidnapping has become a compelling subject in Venezuela, and family members of high-salaried major leaguers would be obvious targets.</p>
        <p>''Almost every day my mother says, 'Carlos, watch where you're going,''' Silva said. ''But I say to her, 'If they want to kidnap someone from our family, they're not going to kidnap me; they're going to kidnap someone from our family.'''</p>
        <p>According to The Associated Press, the number of kidnappings in Venezuela rose from 51 in 1995 to 201 in 2002, the last year for which official figures are available. Villarreal, 54, was abducted from her home Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>''That was a big surprise,'' Silva said. ''That was the first mother of a professional player who got kidnapped. That was scary. After that I was talking to my family and telling them to watch where they're going. It's dangerous. Where I live is more safe, but when they're going to kidnap you, they're going to kidnap you anywhere, so that's why you have to be careful.''</p>
        <p>Families of baseball players become targets when players' salaries become public information.</p>
        <p>''The day after I signed my contract, they put in the paper everything, especially how I'm going to get paid,'' said Silva, who signed a two-year, $5.05 million contract with the Twins this month. ''That's one of the problems. They put in the paper how much money we're going to make. After I sign, everybody was talking about it. That's scary. I have people at my house asking for money.''</p>
        <p>Asking for handouts is one thing, demanding ransom is another. Villarreal's kidnappers, the authorities said, sought $6 million but received nothing. Urbina's mother was fortunate that she didn't suffer the fate of Urbina's father, Juan, who was killed by robbers a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Santana recently signed the biggest contract in Twins history -- four years for $40 million. It, too, was publicized at home. Does the contract create concern?</p>
        <p>''I don't really want to talk about that stuff, if you don't mind,'' said the 25-year-old Santana, the American League Cy Young award winner last season with a 20-6 record. ''You got to be careful because you never know.''</p>
        <p>Does he have family in Venezuela?</p>
        <p>''I got my family there,'' he said, acknowledging parents and a wife. But children? ''I'm not telling you the whole history of my family,'' he said. ''I don't want to go there.''</p>
        <p>When Santana is in the United States, his family is with him. Other members of his family visit periodically.</p>
        <p>Despite the dangers of living at home, many Venezuelan players prefer to go home in the off-season.</p>
        <p>''We asked Carlos Guillen about staying in the States after last season,'' Dave Dombrowski, the Detroit general manager, said about the Tigers' shortstop. ''He said that was his home and that's where he wanted to go.''</p>
        <p>Rincon left his parents and sister at home in Venezuela. His wife, Roselen, whom he recently married, will soon join him here.</p>
        <p>''Where she lives,'' Rincon said, ''they have to have a guard, not because of me but because of the neighborhood. They have guards on every single corner. Not during the day but at night. They steal cars and people break into their houses.''</p>
        <p>In 2002, two gunmen tried to carjack Richard Hidalgo. When he sped off, one of the men, who had held a gun at Hidalgo's head, shot him in the left forearm. Hidalgo, who now plays for Texas, has spent a lot less time in Venezuela since.</p>
        <p>Silva said that not every place in Venezuela was dangerous. But Rincon was speaking generally when he said: ''For everybody, it has become dangerous. You can't walk around with jewels or anything like that. You become a good target to be robbed or killed. When you drive, someone's following you. It's like a nightmare every day.''</p>
        <p>Is kidnapping a concern?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, of course,'' Rincon said. ''When I come here, I can't just forget about it because my family lives there. My mom or my dad, my sister, my wife's relatives. You have to live with that 24/7. We can't do anything about it but try to be at home as much as you can. You have to be sure not to get home late at night or go to the wrong places. You can be a target anywhere.''</p>
        <p>When Rincon is in the United States and speaks to family members by telephone, he said, they don't talk much about problems at home. ''They don't want me to think about those problems,'' he said. ''They want me to be focused on what I'm supposed to be doing.''</p>
        <p>Some players hire guards. Angels pitcher Francisco Rodriguez says he has a guard with him when he is at home, and when he is in the United States, the guard watches his family.</p>
        <p>''Guys who are well known have people guarding them,'' said Rincon, who does not employ a guard. ''It's not good when you have to look in your mirror to see if somebody is following you. It's not the kind of life somebody wants to live.''</p>
