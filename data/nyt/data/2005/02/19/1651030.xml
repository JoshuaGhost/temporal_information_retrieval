        <p>A federal judge yesterday reduced the sentence of a prominent Manhattan gynecologist who is in prison for insurance fraud.</p>
        <p>The gynecologist, Niels H. Lauersen, 68, submitted false bills worth $3.2 million to pay for fertility surgery for his patients that insurance companies did not cover. He will serve 5 years and 10 months instead of the original sentence of 7 years and 3 months he received in October 2001. In lowering the term , the judge, William H. Pauley III, cited Mr. Lauersen's age and the fact that he will likely be deported to his native Denmark after he is released. He has already served four years.</p>

        <p>A federal judge yesterday reduced the sentence of a prominent Manhattan gynecologist who is in prison for insurance fraud.</p>
        <p>The gynecologist, Niels H. Lauersen, 68, submitted false bills worth $3.2 million to pay for fertility surgery for his patients that insurance companies did not cover. He will serve 5 years and 10 months instead of the original sentence of 7 years and 3 months he received in October 2001. In lowering the term , the judge, William H. Pauley III, cited Mr. Lauersen's age and the fact that he will likely be deported to his native Denmark after he is released. He has already served four years.</p>
        <p>At a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Judge Aubrey said that Mr. Lauersen -- whose patients included the actress Liv Ullmann -- had suffered a ''Faustian'' fall ''from the lofty heights of being a Park Avenue surgeon to becoming a convicted felon.'' He noted that Mr. Lauersen had brought ''many hopefully productive people into this world'' through his fertility treatments.</p>
        <p>The judge observed that New York law has since been revised to require insurance companies to cover some fertility treatments.</p>
        <p>But he also found that Mr. Lauersen had never taken responsibility for his crime. He reinstated the order for him to pay the original fine of $17,500 and restitution of the full amount of the fraud.</p>
        <p>Reading a long handwritten statement, Mr. Lauersen, dressed in a navy blue prison uniform, said he was sorry he had ''wasted four years of my time being locked up.'' But he said that he had never turned women away because they could not afford fertility treatment.</p>
        <p>''If I had done that, I would be a king today, not a poor man like I am today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauersen's was one of the first sentences to be revised in federal court in New York since a United States Supreme Court decision in January that made sentencing guidelines no longer mandatory, giving judges new discretion in determining punishment.</p>
