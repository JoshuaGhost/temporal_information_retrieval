        <p>Harry and Louise meet uncute in the emergency room of a small New England hospital inundated with patients. The jittery Louise, whose daughter has an ear infection, has been waiting for hours to see a doctor. She is sitting next to Harry, who is in a wheelchair. He gives her some practiced advice: ''If you annoy the nurses, if you yell at them like that, they purposely make you wait longer. You have to make them like you; compliment their nail polish, or something.''</p>
        <p>In John Belluso's two-character play ''Pyretown,'' presented by Keen Company, there is a third presence in addition to the actors Deirdre O'Connell and Christopher Thornton. Call it the Greedy Health Maintenance Organization, or GHMO, for short: it is the villain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Belluso, who uses a wheelchair himself, clearly has strong feelings about the lack of universal health care in America, as well as about the harsh consequences for many Americans. And he doesn't mind saying so through the lonely Harry, a ''radical leftist Web designer'' in his 20's who falls for the 39-year-old Louise, a stressed-out welfare mother of three, separated from a remorseful husband who has to attend anger-management classes.</p>
        <p>Yet neither the adroitness of Mr. Thornton nor the waifishness of Ms. O'Connell, who manages to look sucker-punched by life for much of the play's 80 minutes, can upstage the invisible GHMO.</p>
        <p>The director, Carl Forsman, who founded Keen in 2000, said in an interview with The New York Times in 2002 that if there weren't ''some aspect'' of a play ''that resonates with an audience today, I won't do it.'' There is plenty in ''Pyretown'' that resonates, but particularly toward the end, it is more lecture than play. The very good costumes by Theresa Squire are more believable than some of the wearers' lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Belluso, the director of the Mark Taper Forum's Other Voices Project in Los Angeles and the author of a number of plays, does understand human nature. He knows that Louise won't go to nursing school and that Harry will remain a pothead. He also knows there is an element of mystery to affliction and a perverse fascination with it by those not afflicted:</p>
        <p>LOUISE: So, if I poke your legs [poking], like this, you really can't feel at all?</p>
        <p>HARRY (smiling): Well, I can see that you're poking my legs, so in a way that's sort of like feeling it. Don't poke my legs.</p>
        <p>LOUISE: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... I guess I was just really curious.</p>
        <p>''Pyretown'' continues at Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, through Feb. 20.</p>
