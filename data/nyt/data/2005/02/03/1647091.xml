        <p>A corporate jet shot off a runway yesterday as it was taking off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, ripped through a metal fence and barreled across a six-lane highway -- striking cars, even peeling the roof off one -- before coming to rest with its nose lodged in the brick wall of a warehouse.

        <p>A corporate jet shot off a runway yesterday as it was taking off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, ripped through a metal fence and barreled across a six-lane highway -- striking cars, even peeling the roof off one -- before coming to rest with its nose lodged in the brick wall of a warehouse. The authorities expressed amazement that nobody was killed, though more than 20 people were injured.</p>
        <p>The jet slammed two parked cars into the wall of the warehouse, which partly collapsed and then caught fire. Other parked cars burst into flames. Terrified office workers bolted to safety while startled drivers outside, confronted with the surreal image of a broken plane sticking out of the building, screeched traffic to a stop on one of the region's busiest highways during the morning rush.</p>
        <p>The plane caught fire but did not explode, even though it was carrying enough fuel for its flight to Chicago. All eight passengers, a group of financial executives, walked or crawled away from the smoking wreck in the building, which is the headquarters of the Strawberry clothing store chain. The three crew members also got out.</p>
        <p>There were many close calls. Rohan Foster, who was driving to work at a nearby factory, was stopped at a red light on Route 46 when his passenger shouted, ''Watch out, the plane is coming.''</p>
        <p>The two men ducked, and the plane tore the roof off the green Toyota, then kept going, according to Mr. Foster's father, Lloyd, who related his son's account. Rohan Foster was admitted to Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck with broken facial bones. He and his passenger would have been killed instantly if they hadn't ducked, his father said.</p>
        <p>''Thank God,'' he said. ''It's a miracle.''</p>
        <p>After crossing Route 46, the jet brought terror and confusion to Strawberry's offices. ''The plane was inside my friend's office,'' said Armando Contreras, 22, an employee who was in a hallway when the building shook with the plane's impact. ''The pilot opened the door and ran.''</p>
        <p>The jet, a Canadair CL-600 Challenger, was part of the same series as the one that crashed in Colorado nine weeks ago, killing a son of Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports, and two crew members.</p>
        <p>Of the 20 people injured at Teterboro, including bystanders and firefighters, four remained hospitalized last night. The most seriously injured was Mr. Foster's passenger, James, whose last name was not released. He was in critical condition at Hackensack University Medical Center with a head wound, a hospital official said.</p>
        <p>The co-pilot suffered a broken leg and was in stable condition last night. One victim, a passenger, was admitted to Hackensack University Medical Center with abdominal pain. The plane's pilot was admitted to the hospital for evaluation in the afternoon, a spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>The wreck shut down the small airport, one of the busiest in the nation for private-plane flights. It re-opened at 6:30 p.m., and traffic was allowed to return to Route 46 shortly before 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board were studying the voice and data recorders from the jet and conducting interviews and tests, but had not yet determined a cause of the crash.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after the crash, local officials renewed calls for federal regulators to reduce traffic at Teterboro. Witnesses to the crash and its aftermath said they were amazed that nobody was killed.</p>
        <p>''I think everybody at this point is extremely lucky and fortunate,'' said Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey of New Jersey, who flew over the scene in a helicopter.</p>
        <p>With fewer than 50 residents, Teterboro, a borough in northern New Jersey, is too small to have its own police force or fire department. Angelo Roccamo, the assistant fire chief in neighboring Hasbrouck Heights, said he saw a plume of dark smoke as he neared the crash site and called for help from other communities.</p>
        <p>When he arrived, the pilot was on the highway and said he was searching for the flight attendant.</p>
        <p>Five of the passengers were employees of Kelso &amp; Company, a private investment firm whose offices are on Park Avenue, and three men from other financial companies were with them, said George Matelich, a Kelso managing director. ''Our people are fine,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The plane is owned by DDH Aviation, a Dallas company, and leased by Kelso, according to Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials. Executives of DDH could not be reached for comment. Kevin Knight, whose company leases office space to DDH, and who answered calls to DDH, said the plane was operated and maintained by Platinum Jet in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Platinum Jet executives did not respond to several requests for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Contreras said he was walking down a hallway in the Strawberry building near an office where signs are made when he heard the crash. ''When I heard the noise, I jumped back,'' he said. ''It felt so close.''</p>
        <p>He opened a door directly in front of him. There, in the sign room, an office the size of a master bedroom, was the rounded, white nose cone of the private jet. His friend, Diego Vargas, 23, hovered near a destroyed computer, blood gushing from his head.</p>
        <p>''I saw a lot of smoke,'' Mr. Contreras said. Other people in the building were screaming and pointing to jet fuel spewing from the plane.</p>
        <p>That was when the pilot pushed open the plane's door and jumped to the ground, Mr. Contreras and other witnesses said. The co-pilot was visible through the cockpit window.</p>
        <p>Flickering flames were also visible near the destroyed jet. Fire alarms screeched and a small crowd that had gathered at the crash site moved quickly away. One man, Claudio Gomez, 32, said that a woman who escaped from the plane was struggling to get past a snow bank, and he helped her.</p>
        <p>Near the rear of the building, farthest away from the crash, about 60 employees in the warehouse were trying to figure out what to do. When the alarms sounded, panic replaced inquiry. ''People were running,'' said one worker, Mario Recinos, 51. ''They said there was an explosion. We didn't know what it was.''</p>
        <p>The building was quickly evacuated. Mr. Recinos found his wife, Vilma, 41, outside. She had been working in an office near the building's eastern corner at the time of the accident. They said the toll could have been worse. If the plane had hit the building an hour earlier, they said, the loading dock just to the left of the sign room would have been teeming with trucks and employees preparing for the day's first distribution run. ''But they were already gone,'' Mrs. Recinos said. ''Thank God.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference last night, Debbie Hersman, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said a fuel sample was taken from the jet and investigators were studying the 6,013-foot runway, which showed no signs of debris or fuel, only skid marks on the last 1,000 feet.</p>
        <p>She said that the rear thrusters on the engine had been deployed to stop the plane. The board was still trying to determine, however, whether the brakes had been deployed.</p>
        <p>As of last night, toxicology tests had not been performed on either the pilot or the co-pilot, she said, and neither man, both of whom were hospitalized, had been interviewed.</p>
        <p>The cockpit voice recorder indicated that there had been a decision to discontinue the takeoff, Ms. Hersman said. The flight data recorder, which monitors the plane's operation, was recovered and was being taken to Washington.</p>
        <p>''We will not rule anything out in this investigation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Fred Dressel, the mayor of Moonachie, where the southern end of the airport is situated, said he could not remember another plane emerging onto Route 46 in the last 40 years.</p>
        <p>Local residents have become increasingly concerned about safety and noise as traffic at Teterboro has boomed. Representative Steven R. Rothman, a Democrat from Bergen County, has fought a proposal to make changes so that the airport could accommodate jets as big as a Boeing 737.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Rothman called on the Federal Aviation Administration to lighten its load. ''Teterboro is operating at capacity and something needs to be done,'' Mr. Rothman said.</p>
        <p>The jet involved in yesterday's crash was one of 84 planes of a model built from 1980 to 1983 by Canadair, a company that was acquired by Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. in 1986.</p>
        <p>Planes in the same Challenger series have been involved in two fatal crashes within the last three years. Mr. Ebersol was aboard a CL-601 jet in November when it crashed in Montrose, Colo., killing his 14-year-old son, Edward, and two crew members. In January 2002, five people were killed in a crash of a CL-604 jet in Birmingham, England.</p>
        <p>British investigators concluded that wind, snow and ice on the wings and tail surfaces may have contributed to the Birmingham crash. The Colorado accident is still under investigation by the safety board, but investigators suspect that ice on the wings was the cause.</p>
        <p>The temperature at Teterboro was below freezing, about 22 degrees, when the plane began to taxi at 7:20 a.m. Ms. Hersman declined to comment on whether ice or frost on the wings may have been a factor in the crash. But she said that a check of airport records showed that the plane was not de-iced, and that no request for de-icing been made. Three witnesses -- two employees of Atlantic Aviation and a pilot in an adjacent plane -- interviewed by investigators reported seeing no frost on the plane, she said.</p>
        <p>Leo Knaapen, a spokesman for Bombardier Aerospace, called the Challenger series' safety record of six in-use accidents in 25 years ''outstanding,'' and a corporate-aviation expert supported that view.</p>
        <p>''Up through 2003, the accident rate for this airplane has been lower than the overall average for business jets,'' said the expert, Robert E. Breiling, an aviation consultant in Boca Raton, Fla. The CL-600 had 0.88 nonfatal accidents, and 0.18 fatal accidents, for every 100,000 flying hours, he said, compared with industrywide averages of 1.17 and 0.38.</p>
