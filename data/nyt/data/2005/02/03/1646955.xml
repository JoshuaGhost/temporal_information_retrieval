        <p>From View-Masters to disposable 3-D glasses, entertainment buffs have been toying with imaging devices for decades. One of the latest ones, the Z800 3D Visor, from a company called eMagin, aims to take the concept in a new direction.</p>
        <p>The eight-ounce visor, which is expected to go on sale by May at emagin.com for $900, is a personal display system that sits on your head like a pair of glasses. The idea is to immerse gamers, designers and cinephiles in their activities by means of two microdisplays made of organic light-emitting diodes that produce 3-D stereovision and a 360-degree gyroscopic head tracker that places viewers in the middle of the action.</p>

        <p>From View-Masters to disposable 3-D glasses, entertainment buffs have been toying with imaging devices for decades. One of the latest ones, the Z800 3D Visor, from a company called eMagin, aims to take the concept in a new direction.</p>
        <p>The eight-ounce visor, which is expected to go on sale by May at emagin.com for $900, is a personal display system that sits on your head like a pair of glasses. The idea is to immerse gamers, designers and cinephiles in their activities by means of two microdisplays made of organic light-emitting diodes that produce 3-D stereovision and a 360-degree gyroscopic head tracker that places viewers in the middle of the action.</p>
        <p>The visor's image resolution is 2.8 million pixels, enough to mimic the effect of watching a film on a 105-inch screen at 12 feet. It connects to a PC's U.S.B. port and gets its power from a computer. And it comes with hi-fi earphones and a built-in noise-canceling microphone to complete the immersion experience.</p>
        <p>''You won't just be able to play games in a more interesting way but use data in ways never thought possible,'' said Gary W. Jones, chief executive of eMagin. ''Instead of using one 30-inch monitor to view a presentation, you can watch a whole roomful of them privately.''</p>
        <p>Avoiding the appearance of being antisocial while wearing the visor, however, may be a challenge.</p>
