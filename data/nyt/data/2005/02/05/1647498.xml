        <p>A union leader says the card he gave a local reporter here on Wednesday was meant as a thank you for her years of ''fair and equitable reporting.''</p>
        <p>But when Melissa Klein, a reporter for The Journal News, opened the card at home later that night, she said, she was shocked.</p>
        <p>Tucked inside the card wishing Ms. Klein ''a prosperous year'' were five $100 bills. She turned the money over to her editor the next morning.</p>
        <p>The incident, which was reported in Friday's issue of The Journal News, has now landed the local union official, Dunbar John, in trouble with the state unit of his union, the Civil Service Employees Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. John, president of the union's 1,600-member unit at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, has been accused by state union officials of conduct detrimental to the union. His unit also faces an internal audit by the officials, who will take custody of the local group's financial records.</p>
        <p>Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for Danny Donohue, president of the union's statewide unit, which has 265,000 members, called Mr. John's action ''a very public incident that calls into question the credibility and integrity'' of the union. ''There are serious financial problems at the medical center, and the union has been working very hard with the state and county to address them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. John, 56, who has been a nurse at the medical center for 23 years, said he was surprised by the uproar. ''There was no intent to harm or influence or look for any favors,'' he said. ''I just wanted to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and thank her for all the years she has been reporting in a fair and equitable way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. John said that the $500 came from him, not from the union, and that he was unaware that reporters should not accept gifts from the people and organizations they cover.</p>
        <p>''We would never accept a monetary gift from a source like that,'' said CynDee Royle, senior managing editor for The Journal News. She said the paper ''has a very clear ethics policy that instructs reporters and editors to keep an arm's length and not allow any undue influence over the coverage of a story.''</p>
        <p>The medical center has operated at a loss since 2001, with the deficit for 2004 estimated at $50 million.</p>
