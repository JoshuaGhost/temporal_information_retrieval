        <p>Unlike members of the White House staff who maintain the fiction that resigning was their decision, the executive chef, Walter Scheib 3rd, minced no words Friday in saying he had been fired.</p>

        <p>Unlike members of the White House staff who maintain the fiction that resigning was their decision, the executive chef, Walter Scheib 3rd, minced no words Friday in saying he had been fired.</p>
        <p>''We've been trying to find a way to satisfy the first lady's stylistic requirements,'' Mr. Scheib said in a telephone interview, ''and it has been difficult. Basically I was not successful in my attempt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheib sensed a change afoot, he said, when Cathy Fenton was succeeded as White House social secretary last month by Lea Berman, the wife of Wayne Berman, a wealthy contributor to the Republican Party. Mrs. Berman is a well-known Washington hostess who entertains in a 13,000-square-foot Embassy Row mansion.</p>
        <p>''Clearly with the new social secretary, there is a new set of eyes and a new vision,'' said Mr. Scheib, whose imminent departure was first reported Friday by The Washington Post. ''She is a very hands-on social secretary, very involved with all aspects of food, flowers and d√©cor. She clearly has a mandate.''</p>
        <p>The 50-year-old Mr. Scheib said he was determined to leave on a positive note, his dignity intact. But he also said he was disappointed in himself.</p>
        <p>''This failure is a loss,'' he said, ''and I hate to lose, because I am supercompetitive.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, there is a limit to how creative a chef can be at the White House.</p>
        <p>''While it is an honor to serve the first family,'' he said, ''it is the same thing, night in and night out, over an extended period. And it's time for me to be exploring all of my creative abilities and not limiting myself.''</p>
        <p>Even official dinners can be unsatisfying.</p>
        <p>''These are not Escoffier dinners,'' Mr. Scheib said in a 1998 interview before a dinner in honor of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. ''You can spin it any way you want, it's still a banquet. How you serve 240 people and have them not think it's another rubber-chicken-circuit dinner, that's the job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheib, who studied at the Culinary Institute of America, was hired away from the exclusive Greenbrier resort in West Virginia 11 years ago by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the first lady. A search is now under way for a new White House chef, but Mr. Scheib, who was noted for his introduction of American foods and wines and the use of fresh ingredients, expects to remain at least until the end of the month.</p>
        <p>Since Wednesday, when he was asked to resign, he has been gearing up to find something else.</p>
        <p>''You are only the ex-chef at the White House for the next six months,'' he said, ''so you need to look at various opportunities: literary, media, product representation or back to the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>But he is not worried.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to be running the local pancake house,'' he said.</p>
