        <p>Two men who robbed a Jamaica grocery and pistol-whipped its owner yesterday tried to escape on the subway, but were spotted by officers who stopped the train and arrested them, the police said. The robbery occurred at the grocery, at 168th Street near the corner of Hillside Avenue, at 11:20 a.m., when two men beat the 43-year-old owner and stole $1,100, the police said. They then boarded a Manhattan-bound F train, the police said, but officers found them a few stops later, at the Van Wyck Boulevard Station. The men were held there until the victim arrived and identified them as his attackers, the police said. The suspects were identified as Raheem Bailey, 28, of 112-19 208th Street in Queens, and Alonzo Jones, 25, of 302 Turtle Road in Woodbury, Conn. They were charged with robbery and assault, the police said.</p>
