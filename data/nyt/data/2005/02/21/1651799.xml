        <p>Writers' Film Awards</p>
        <p>''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'' and ''Sideways'' were winners at the 57th annual Writers Guild Awards on Saturday, held simultaneously in Los Angeles and New York. ''Eternal Sunshine,'' written by Charlie Kaufman, based on a story by Mr. Kaufman, the director Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth, won for best original screenplay. ''Sideways,'' right, written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor from the novel by Rex Pickett, won best adapted screenplay. Both films are up for awards in the same categories at the Oscars. For television, an episode of ''The West Wing'' won for episodic drama; Tony Kushner won best long-form adapted screenplay for ''Angels in America''; ''Arrested Development'' and ''Malcolm in the Middle'' won for comedy; and an episode of ''The Simpsons'' won for animated series.</p>
        <p>'Vagina Monologues' Banned in Uganda</p>
        <p>The Ugandan government banned a performance of ''The Vagina Monologues'' planned by women's groups for Feb. 19 on the grounds that the play was offensive to traditional values. Officials had earlier said that while they disapproved of the play they would not ban it, but late last week the state information minister, James Nsaba Buturo, called for the prohibition, saying the work did not focus on sexual violence, as women's rights advocates had said, but rather on women's private parts, The Associated Press reported. ''This is the stuff that homosexuals and pornography promoters feed on,'' Mr. Buturo said in a statement. Activists said a goal of the production had been achieved anyway. ''Our major issue was to raise concerns about the rights of women, their suffering on the domestic and other fronts,'' Sarah Mukasa said. ''Although the play has been banned, our point has been made.''</p>
        <p>'Producers' Takes London Theater Awards</p>
        <p>''The Producers'' won big at the Laurence Olivier Awards for British theater, announced last night in London. The show, which opened in the West End in October, was nominated for eight awards and won three: best new musical, best actor in a musical (Nathan Lane, below, who was a last-minute substitute on opening night, filling in for an ailing Richard Dreyfuss) and best supporting actor in a musical (Conleth Hill). Alan Bennett's acclaimed show ''The History Boys'' won three awards, too: best new play, best director (Nicholas Hytner) and best actor (Richard Griffiths). Mr. Bennett also received a special award for his contributions to British theater. The hit production of ''Mary Poppins'' had nine nominations and won two awards, for best actress in a musical (Laura Michelle Kelly) and for best theater choreographer (Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mear).</p>
        <p>Alliance for Arts Funds</p>
        <p>Two big nonprofits, Americans for the Arts in Washington and the Arts and Business Council in New York, will merge their operations, forming the largest arts advocacy group in the country, the organizations announced. The combined agencies will promote the arts and obtain arts financing from the private sector. By combining, the groups say they will raise more money, a necessary goal since the total philanthropy devoted to nonprofit arts groups has declined by nearly a third since 1990, the groups say.</p>
        <p>Pop CD's in Release</p>
        <p>New pop albums to be released tomorrow include a number of comebacks and indie-rock favorites. Tori Amos will release ''The Beekeeper'' (Sony), her first new album in three years (Critic's Choice, Page 3). ''Aha Shake Heartbreak'' (RCA), the much anticipated new album by Kings of Leon, the Southern rock newcomers who have recently been announced as the opening act for U2's new world tour, will come out in the United States after becoming a minor hit in Britain. Omarion, of the pop vocal hitmakers B2K, releases ''O'' (Sony). Ian Brown, of the 1980's British art-rock sensation the Stone Roses, has a solo album, ''Solarized'' (Koch). Petra Haden, of the 1990's alt-rock band That Dog, releases ''Petra Haden Sings: The Who Sell Out'' (Bar/None), an a cappella remake of the Who's classic 1967 album ''The Who Sell Out.'' The singer Ben Lee releases ''Awake Is the New Sleep'' (New West), and Iron and Wine, the hit indie-folk act, has a new EP, ''Woman King'' (Sub Pop).</p>
        <p>Bailout for Edinburgh</p>
        <p>The struggling Edinburgh International Festival has been given the $1.1 million bailout it needed to present its program this year. Half the money was given by the EventScotland agency and the other half comes from the Edinburgh city council, The Scotsman newspaper reported. The three-week festival usually sells about 400,000 tickets a year and attracts an estimated $35 million in spending to the city, but its financing has not kept up with inflation, organizers have said.</p>
        <p>Memorial to Drummer</p>
        <p>The Doobie Brothers said they would donate proceeds from their Doobie Red Wine to the National Veterans Foundation for the next five years in memory of the band's drummer, Keith Knudsen, who died on Feb. 8 of pneumonia, The Associated Press reported. Knudsen, who was 56, played with the band on a string of hits, including ''Black Water'' and ''Taking It to the Streets'' and is credited with pushing the group to re-form in 1987. ''The National Veterans Foundation and founder Shad Meshad were very close to Keith, the band and me,'' said the band's manager, Bruce Cohn, in a statement last week. Doobie Red is produced by Mr. Cohn's B.R. Cohn Winery in Glen Ellen, Calif.</p>
