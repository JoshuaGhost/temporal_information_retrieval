        <p>Energy Department budget is cut by 2 percent, to $23.4 billion, in Pres Bush's proposed 2006 spending plan; programs that have to do with nuclear security would see increases as would plan to develop new generation of nuclear plants, but programs to clean up waste are significantly cut; details noted (M)</p>

        <p>The Department of Energy will have about 2 percent less money to spend next year than in the current year if Congress approves the administration's request for $23.44 billion.</p>
        <p>Despite that proposal for $475 million in cuts over all, though, some programs would get slightly more money.

        <p>The Department of Energy will have about 2 percent less money to spend next year than in the current year if Congress approves the administration's request for $23.44 billion.</p>
        <p>Despite that proposal for $475 million in cuts over all, though, some programs would get slightly more money. Requested financing for the National Nuclear Security Administration, which performs most weapons activities, is up $233 million, to $9.40 billion, including money for securing Russian nuclear material and searching for nuclear weapons in ships bound for American ports.</p>
        <p>New kinds of nuclear plants that could produce hydrogen would get more money, including $511 million, up $25 million, for nurturing a new generation of power reactors with pilot plants by 2010, and money for entirely new designs.</p>
        <p>The request for environmental work is down $501 million. Officials said that some of the work had been completed and that expenses were falling as cold-war-era nuclear sites were closed.</p>
        <p>Financing for cleanup at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, in southeastern Washington State, would be cut by $267 million, to $1.8 billion. Officials said the reason was a dispute with the State of Washington over how clean was clean enough. The department recently announced agreements with Idaho and South Carolina, where similar wastes are stored, that allow leaving some of the liquids in old tanks.</p>
        <p>Because of the legal dispute, ''we don't feel we can spend more than this in a reasonable and intelligent way,'' said Bruce Carnes, associate deputy secretary. The decision may bring a legal challenge from the state.</p>
        <p>The request for the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, near Las Vegas, is up $79 million, to $651 million. The department hopes to apply for a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by December, but the date when the repository could actually open is highly uncertain.</p>
        <p>The budget request seeks no new money for alleviating the spike in natural-gas prices, which have tripled in recent years, putting pressure on industry and homeowners.</p>
