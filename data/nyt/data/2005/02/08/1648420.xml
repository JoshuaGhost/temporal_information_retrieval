        <p>Having cycled through every negative emotion and every method for failure, having exhausted their psyches along the way, the Knicks reached the end of a long and trying trip in search of relief.</p>
        <p>They found it Monday night, at long last, but only after spending another evening wallowing in their own absurdity.</p>
        <p>In a repeat of Friday's collapse at Sacramento, the Knicks blew a 13-point fourth-quarter lead against the Utah Jazz. In a new twist -- at least, for them -- the Knicks kept their cool, rode Stephon Marbury through overtime and left with a 102-99 victory.</p>
        <p>So the five-game losing streak is over, and the misery is on hold.</p>
        <p>Coach Herb Williams, too weary to attach the verbs to his thoughts, said: ''A lot of heart. A lot of character. A lot of pride.''</p>
        <p>It was just the Knicks' third victory in 19 games, and certainly the most important among them. A loss would have sent them home with an 0-6 trip, the franchise's worst in 39 years. The Miami Heat await them Wednesday night. This was no time to squander good fortune, but they came close.</p>
        <p>The Knicks held a 13-point lead with four minutes to play, and a 5-point lead with less than two minutes to play. And still, the lead shrank, as Mike Sweetney, Tim Thomas and Nazr Mohammed combined to miss 7 of 8 free throws. It looked like a repeat of a bad show. Three nights earlier, the Knicks lost to the Kings after leading by 11 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''We were kind of like, 'No, it's not going to happen again; this cannot happen to us again,''' Mohammed said. ''Whatever it takes, we cannot let this happen again. So we came together and everybody just kept continuing to play.''</p>
        <p>Trevor Ariza batted away two Jazz passes in the final seconds of regulation, and it appeared the Knicks would close out the game. But with two-tenths of a second left, Ariza was called for a foul against Gordan Giricek, 20 feet from the basket. Ariza hit Giricek's hand on his follow-through, a touch foul that often is not called. ''Of course, I had a problem with the foul,'' Ariza said.</p>
        <p>Giricek made both free throws to force overtime. But Marbury, who has often been faulted for failing to take the big shots this season, came through gloriously. He scored 8 points in the extra period to finish with 30.</p>
        <p>Marbury said it was not his intention to take over, but his teammates saw it differently.</p>
        <p>''That,'' Penny Hardaway said, ''is the Stephon we know. Tonight, he was a superstar.''</p>
        <p>Sweetney scored 16 points and had 9 rebounds. Kurt Thomas had 16 points and 8 rebounds. Hardaway scored 13 points. Ariza had 14. Andrei Kirilenko led Utah with 25 points.</p>
        <p>Before the Knicks could exhale, they had to endure another night of pain. Tim Thomas sprained his left index finger with 5:25 left in the second quarter and missed the rest of the half.</p>
        <p>That left the Knicks temporarily with nine healthy players, and just four to play guard and small forward. Jerome Williams was out because of a sore right foot. Jamal Crawford was resting a sprained left ankle. Thomas returned to start the second half, with his index finger taped to his middle finger, but he was limited by foul trouble.</p>
        <p>The whole 10-day trip went that way. Thomas rejoined the rotation, and Crawford and Williams left it. Crawford, Ariza and Hardaway all sprained ankles and Mohammed pulled a groin muscle.</p>
        <p>Collectively, they absorbed enough radiation to heat a frozen sausage, with Ariza, Williams, Crawford and Thomas all getting X-rays.</p>
        <p>The Knicks had played well in Sacramento and hung tough in Phoenix, and there was a sense of progress in the defeats. It all started with a little benign violence. Figuring the Knicks needed a good smack in the head, Jerome Williams decided to apply one to every teammate. As they took the court Friday night at Sacramento, Williams slapped them all. Then he had Allan Houston and Vin Baker smack him. ''Slap line,'' Williams explained. ''Everybody just had to get slapped.''</p>
        <p>''He hit me on the back of my head pretty hard,'' Hardaway said with a chuckle. ''Nobody knew what was coming. He caught everybody off guard. It was funny.''</p>
        <p>And, apparently, effective.</p>
        <p>''We were down a little bit,'' Hardaway said. ''It was needed.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Stephon Marbury expects to be overlooked when the league announces reserves for the All-Star Game on Tuesday. And he said he is fine with it. ''The way we've been playing as of late, I know I won't make it,'' Marbury said. ''If it was just about individual numbers, then I'd have made it a whole bunch of years.'' Marbury will be hurt by the Knicks' poor record, and the Eastern Conference is stocked with top guards. . . . . Jerome Williams is scheduled to have an M.R.I. on his sore right foot Tuesday. The foot has been sore for several weeks and was aggravated when Williams was kicked during a practice Wednesday. . . . The Knicks' longest road swing without a victory was an 0-7 trip in 1966.</p>
