        <p>For two straight seasons, the Staten Island Dolphins lost the City University of New York Athletic Conference women's championship when Hunter made game-winning shots at the buzzer. Last night, the Dolphins left nothing to chance, defeating the Hawks, 73-60, at Lehman College in the Bronx behind a balanced scoring attack to win its first CUNY title in four years.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins led by as many as 16 points in the second half. But center Jacclyn Rock, one of two seniors on the squad along with Stephanie Iosue, said it was not until the end was near that she felt confident enough to think about victory.</p>

        <p>For two straight seasons, the Staten Island Dolphins lost the City University of New York Athletic Conference women's championship when Hunter made game-winning shots at the buzzer. Last night, the Dolphins left nothing to chance, defeating the Hawks, 73-60, at Lehman College in the Bronx behind a balanced scoring attack to win its first CUNY title in four years.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins led by as many as 16 points in the second half. But center Jacclyn Rock, one of two seniors on the squad along with Stephanie Iosue, said it was not until the end was near that she felt confident enough to think about victory.</p>
        <p>''It was great, when I saw it was 13-point-something seconds left and we were up by 13,'' said Rock, who had 16 points and 8 rebounds. ''I said: 'Oh, my God, we did it. They ain't coming back,'''</p>
        <p>Dolphins guard Acasha Gordon finished with a game-high 23 points and was named the most valuable player. Gordon, a sophomore, shot 8 of 15 from the floor, including 4 of 7 from 3-point range. She had 16 points in the first half and scored 11 of her team's points during a 13-4 run in the final four minutes of the first half to give the Dolphins a 36-27 lead at halftime.</p>
        <p>Staten Island Coach Marguerite Gualtieri, who is in her seventh season, acknowledged that her team had been devastated by the last two losses in the tournament final.</p>
        <p>This season, the Dolphins closed the regular season with a 25-2 record, the best in the program's history, and a 12-1 record in the conference. They will advance to the N.C.A.A. Division III tournament.</p>
        <p>Hunter, which finished the regular season 13-14, but 10-3 in the conference, had four players in double figures last night. Point guard Jen Ithier led the way with 18 points. She hit 4 of 9 from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>Forward Jessica Proscia had 13 points, guard Michelle Apostol had 12 and forward Krystin Suarez added 10.</p>
        <p>Hunter Coach Jackee Meadow said the difference in the game came at the free-throw line. The Hawks were 10 of 15 and the Dolphins were 17 of 24.</p>
        <p>''We executed well, boxed out and stopped their transition game,'' Meadow said. ''Where we got hurt was foul shots.''</p>
        <p>But Meadow said that unlike the previous years, when Staten Island seemed to crack under pressure and failed to use the clock effectively, the Dolphins stayed poised and responded well this time.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Rock said with a smile that she had recruited several family members and friends to travel from Staten Island to the Bronx because she knew the Dolphins were going to win.</p>
        <p>''The last two times we didn't use the clock to our advantage,'' Rock said. ''This time, we didn't waste the clock with a big lead, and now we can go party at Coach's house.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>New York City College of Technology (21-5) reached the N.C.A.A. men's Division III tournament for the first time with a 76-66 victory over Staten Island (16-12) in last night's other final. City Tech was led by Shacun Malave, the tournament most valuable player, who had 12 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocked shots. For the retiring coach Ray Amalbert, it will be the sixth N.C.A.A. tournament appearance, the first five coming with Hunter.</p>
