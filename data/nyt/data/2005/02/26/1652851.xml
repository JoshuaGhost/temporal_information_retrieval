        <p>Michael Sweetney says he is willing to play whenever and wherever he is told, which makes him perfect for the newest version of the Knicks. They seem to have a lot of parts of roughly the same size in the body shop.</p>
        <p>''I'll just keep doing what I've been doing when my name is called,'' Sweetney said Friday after practice.</p>
        <p>After two roster-jumbling trades at the N.B.A. trade deadline Thursday, the Knicks (22-33) are loaded with forwards. That did not make a difference to guard Stephon Marbury, who said the Knicks had become better.</p>
        <p>''It gives us some depth,'' Marbury said.</p>
        <p>Referring to the maneuvering by Isiah Thomas, the team president, Marbury said: ''I think it moves us forward. I don't think Isiah would do anything to set us going backwards.''</p>
        <p>Later, when asked if the Knicks' chemistry had been disrupted, Marbury said: ''The thing that's important is making the playoffs. And that's it.''</p>
        <p>Yes, the Knicks still think they can make the playoffs, even though they have not won two games in a row since Dec. 29. The Knicks entered Friday five games behind the Atlantic Division leader, the Boston Celtics.</p>
        <p>The Knicks still did not have enough players for practice Friday because their two newest players -- Malik Rose and Maurice Taylor -- arrived in New York on Friday morning and had physical examinations.</p>
        <p>Herb Williams, the interim coach, stood alone at midcourt at the end of practice, a basketball under his left arm, his right hand in his pocket. He watched four players shoot free throws at one end of the floor and five players shoot at the other.</p>
        <p>Rose and Taylor are expected to be available for the game Saturday at Madison Square Garden against the Indiana Pacers, though Williams had only a general idea of how much he would use them and where they would play.</p>
        <p>''It's the N.B.A.,'' Williams said. ''There were tons of trades. A lot of teams are going through it.''</p>
        <p>Rose, a 6-foot-7 forward, was obtained along with two first-round picks from the San Antonio Spurs for center Nazr Mohammed and guard Jamison Brewer. Williams said Rose was a better defender and rebounder than Taylor.</p>
        <p>''He works guys hard,'' Williams said of Rose. ''He's a very physical and very active player.''</p>
        <p>Taylor, a 6-9 forward, was obtained from Houston for guard Moochie Norris, forward Vin Baker and a second-round draft pick.</p>
        <p>Taylor has a better jump shot than Rose and is more likely, Williams said, to be a small forward than a power forward.</p>
        <p>Sweetney, who started at power forward in the Knicks' 113-101 victory Thursday over the Philadelphia 76ers, will probably continue to do so, with the former power forward, Kurt Thomas, remaining at center.</p>
        <p>''Kurt is the one guy I know can play center,'' Williams said. ''Any time I can move a guy around, he's the guy I feel comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>Kurt Thomas probably did not gain much clout with Isiah Thomas when he said Wednesday that they had practically no relationship and that Marbury was the only player he could think of who had a pipeline to Thomas's office.</p>
        <p>''He plays for the New York Knicks,'' Williams said of Kurt Thomas. ''I don't think it's a tough sell. He's just a professional.''</p>
        <p>But Williams reserved the right to change his mind about Sweetney. Rose or Taylor could end up replacing him as a starter.</p>
        <p>Williams seemed to be sure only that Jamal Crawford would slide over from shooting guard to give Marbury a breather.</p>
        <p>Or maybe Penny Hardaway could do that, Williams added.</p>
        <p>With a 6-9 starter at center and the rarely used Bruno Sundov their only player taller than 7 feet, the Knicks would seem to be more susceptible to being pounded by a formidable center like Shaquille O'Neal of the Miami Heat.</p>
        <p>''We've been doing that all year,'' a chuckling Williams said of using a lineup that has been several inches too small.</p>
        <p>Williams will need to pare the playbook until Rose and Taylor can catch up. He said he did not think that would be a problem for either player -- most teams run versions of basic plays, he said. But the Knicks will not be catching opponents unprepared.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the day before the trading deadline, Williams said the Knicks would need time to adjust to any roster changes. The Knicks have barely had time to adjust to his coaching the team instead of Lenny Wilkens.</p>
        <p>''Whatever happens, happens,'' Sweetney said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
        <p>Sweetney was asked if he had been told if he would start Saturday. He said he would be starting.</p>
        <p>After a pause, he added: ''I guess. Who knows?''</p>
        <p>That seems to have become the team's motto.</p>
