        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It was heartening to see David Brooks concede that there are serious problems with the way the Bush administration and the Republican leadership in Congress are managing the country. I knew that there had to be a rational conservative out there who didn't buy into the financial tricks being used to justify our large deficits and ill-conceived policies.</p>

        <p>I imagine that Mr. Brooks might face some criticism in conservative circles for his critique, but he has gained credibility for his courage.</p>
