        <p>The Brazilian bank, Banco Itaú Holding Financeira, said its profit rose 20.6 percent, to 1.03 billion reais ($396 million), in the fourth quarter of last year, helped by an increase in demand for credit and higher interest rates. Itaú, which is based in São Paulo, finished the year with 130.3 billion reais in assets, a 9.8 percent increase over the previous year. Its loan portfolio grew to 53.27 billion reais last year, helped by a 69 percent increase in lending to small and medium-size businesses.</p>
