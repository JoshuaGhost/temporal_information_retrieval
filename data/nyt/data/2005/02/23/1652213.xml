        <p>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 22 - Pedro Martínez has a strange way of expressing affection.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Pedro Martínez has a strange way of expressing affection.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to voice loyalty to his new starting catcher, Mike Piazza, Martínez said on Tuesday, ''I'll blow your head off for him.'' To add emphasis, he then pretended to shoot an imaginary handgun.</p>
        <p>Martínez, whose antics have enlivened the Mets' spring training camp, showed off his trigger finger after throwing 30 pitches of batting practice Tuesday. Martínez was caught by Piazza, who came up with him through the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization and was hit by Martínez with a fastball in an interleague game in 1998. Martínez broke Piazza's hand with the ball and then engaged him in a nasty exchange.</p>
        <p>Piazza said Martínez was a fierce competitor on the mound. ''That's what makes him so great,'' he said. ''It's what we need. He brings out emotion and fire.''</p>
        <p>Martínez and Piazza say their confrontation was simply a byproduct of competitive heat. They insist that they share a close personal connection from their days in the Dodgers' minor league system, when they would hang around the field after games to talk with the Hall of Fame pitchers Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax.</p>
        <p>If a rift ever does develop, Martínez is not one to hide anything. Asked to assess Piazza's catching abilities on Tuesday, he was typically honest. ''He doesn't have any problems receiving pitches,'' Martínez said. ''His throwing program, I don't know who's going to help him or what he's going to do. I know I have to hold runners for him, and I can do that. I'm a happy camper.''</p>
        <p>Martínez said his arm felt better than it did at this time a year ago and that he was becoming increasingly comfortable with his new catcher. When Piazza learned that Martínez said he would kill for him, he said, ''He doesn't need to do that.''</p>
