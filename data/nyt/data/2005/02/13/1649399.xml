        <p>MY GUARDIAN ANGEL</p>
        <p>By Sylvie Weil.</p>
        <p>Translated by Gillian Rosner.</p>
        <p>202 pp. Arthur A. Levine Books/</p>
        <p>Scholastic. $16.95.</p>
        <p>(Ages 9 to 12)</p>
        <p>THE great medieval French rabbi known as Rashi had several grandchildren, two of whom became prominent scholars themselves. He also had a granddaughter named Elvina, whose wisdom has been lost to legend, since she left no written texts behind.</p>
        <p>Sylvie Weil, a French classics scholar, has decided to give Elvina her due. So it is Rashi's granddaughter, and not his well-regarded grandsons, who is the central figure in ''My Guardian Angel,'' Weil's historical novel about what happened to the Jewish community in Troyes, France, when the Crusaders came to town in 1096.</p>
        <p>Twelve-year-old Elvina is a familiar kind of heroine in children's literature: a smart girl who longs for the privileges boys have, and clearly deserves them because she is brave, wise, feisty. You get the picture. But Elvina belongs to another group as well -- call them the other Lost Tribe, the women left out of Jewish history, whose stories modern writers have imagined with a strong feminist spin.</p>
        <p>Anita Diamant became a leading figure of this genre with ''The Red Tent,'' her heavy-breathing -- and hugely best-selling -- account of Dinah, who is represented in Genesis mainly as a rape victim who doesn't speak, but is transformed by Diamant into an icon of biblical womanhood.</p>
        <p>''My Guardian Angel'' is meant for young readers, so it can't rely on ''Red Tent'' lustiness to lure readers into an arcane, ancient world. Instead, Weil creates an adventure story, in which Elvina protects a teenage defector from the Crusades (a bookworm like her) and ends up saving her Jewish community from harm.</p>
        <p>Weil has stocked her tale generously with odd atmospheric details, particularly those involving household life: the strange, greasy pleasure Elvina takes in spinning wool, or her disgust on hearing that German women whitened their laundry by soaking it in dog dung for a day or two before washing it with soap.</p>
        <p>Yet the storytelling is not always smooth, despite Gillian Rosner's competent and idiomatic translation from the French. Sometimes Elvina speaks directly to the reader, confiding in her ''Mazal,'' her guardian angel, about the disadvantages of being a girl; her irritation with her brother; her difficulties with her father; and her adoration of her grandfather, a wise man who returns the emotion. In other chapters Weil shifts into the third person, and the gears can groan in the process.</p>
        <p>The book's real strength is not literary but cultural and historic. The Harry Potter generation will find surprising familiarity in the superstition, ritual and magic that rule in Elvina's world. Amulets contain the names of angels to protect newborns from baby-snatching demons. The mysterious secrets and medicinal cures Elvina learns from books make her an object of suspicion among non-Jews, even girls she thought were her friends.</p>
        <p>The local apothecary shop carries inventories of scorpions, vipers and toads, and tiny scales for weighing frogs' hearts and grasshoppers' eggs. And history itself served up the fabulous moniker of Peter the Hermit, the Crusade leader.</p>
        <p>Elvina's family and community elude the brutality of the Crusaders in part because of Elvina's willingness to extend kindness to an enemy. Yet Weil does not overextend the hopeful, history-denying notion that kindness begets kindness. Danger lurks everywhere in ''My Guardian Angel.'' In the afterword, Weil observes that while the Jews of Troyes actually were given reprieve, Peter the Hermit's troops were responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews in the German cities of Mainz, Worms and Speyer.</p>
