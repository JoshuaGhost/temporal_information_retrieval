        <p>New York City's last frontier is on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>The island's southern toe still has three stables for trail riding, a red barn or two, winding roads without sidewalks and lots of ramshackle houses that would fit nicely into the hardscrabble hills of West Virginia. There is a Currier and Ives village called Tottenville, where city emblems on police cars seem like anomalies. There are salt marshes galore and rare plants that grow almost nowhere else.</p>
        <p>But the march of change in what is the state's fastest-growing county is trampling even such vestiges of countrified character. A wave of development has rolled across Staten Island -- 23,000 tightly packed, carbon-copy town houses and other homes were built in the 1990's -- and continues to blot out leafy plots of Victorians and colonials that once gave the island its sleepy, roomy feel. A stone's throw from the stables, bulldozers are clearing 42 acres of woods for a mall that will include a Home Depot, a Target and a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, and there is talk of a Wal-Mart in the borough as well.</p>
        <p>Elaine Cohen, who boards her chestnut gelding, Willy Sho Maker, at Equus Stables and rides four times a week, said that until recent years the neighborhood known as Charleston looked more like the rustic upstate than the city.</p>
        <p>''Now, forget about it!'' she said. ''They're taking the ruralness out of the area.''</p>
        <p>Because the island was a collection of self-reliant villages and hamlets until 1898, Staten Islanders have not, with a few notable exceptions, been much for boroughwide uprisings. Still, some are banding together against what they consider overdevelopment as well as the resulting traffic congestion and school overcrowding.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 12, at the historic courthouse in Richmondtown, representatives of 20 neighborhood civic and environmental groups met for the first time as the ''Coalition to Save Staten Island'' to bring more muscle to fights like that against the mall, Bricktown Center, in which the Home Depot is planned.</p>
        <p>''Staten Islanders are rallying to save what's left of Staten Island,'' said David Burg, 54, who heads Wild Metro, a two-year-old environmental group that convened the meeting but is based in Manhattan. He blamed a history of ''strong cooperation between builders and political leaders'' for much of the development.</p>
        <p>Of course, development has always presented a puzzle for political leaders, and many emphasize its upside -- increased tax collections, construction jobs, and new houses that would allow Asian and Russian immigrants, among others, to forsake apartments in Brooklyn for their first houses in America. The 2000 Census counted 4,331 Chinese, 3,499 Indians and 3,452 Russians in the city's least urban borough.</p>
        <p>James P. Molinaro, the borough president, does not like the word overdevelopment. What he opposes is development that is out of character.</p>
        <p>He talked proudly of how he and the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg succeeded in the last two years in rezoning large regions of the island so that clusters of attached homes could no longer be jammed into single-home plots. While the old zoning language permitted backyards no wider than a human arm span, the new regulations require larger backyards.</p>
        <p>''On the same three-acre parcel that you could build 55 homes before I became borough president, you can now build only 20,'' Mr. Molinaro said.</p>
        <p>But he made clear that he supported the continued building of homes and stores, arguing, for example, that town houses were appropriate as starter homes as long as they were built in neighborhoods that already had lots of them. He would welcome a Wal-Mart ''with open arms,'' he said, because if Staten Island does not build stores it will lose sales taxes to New Jersey. He holds no love for the protesters.</p>
        <p>''There are obstructionists and environmentalists,'' he said. ''I'm dealing with a lot of obstructionists.''</p>
        <p>A snapshot of what is happening to southern and western Staten Island would look pretty much like Queens in the 1950's, when grasslands, woods and swamps in neighborhoods like southern Flushing and Bayside were gobbled up for housing and Queens took its present densely populated shape.</p>
        <p>Even Staten Island, which had 191,555 people in 1950, began to dissolve as a bucolic redoubt after 1964 with the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Andrew J. Lanza, the Republican councilman who represents southern Staten Island, attributes much of the urbanization to city officials who auctioned off large swaths of land cheaply during the 1970's and 1980's to help stave off municipal bankruptcy. A 1961 zoning code did allow for dense housing, but Staten Islanders did not worry back then since much of the island was without sewers, a fact that would have discouraged development.</p>
        <p>All that started to change in the 1970's as residents of the other boroughs clamored to leave neighborhoods where crime was surging and school quality plunging. The velocity of change accelerated in the 1980's, and during the 1990's the island's population grew by 65,000 people, or 17 percent, to 443,728. Now Staten Islanders are trying to seize what is left of its countrified soul before it fades into memory.</p>
        <p>Equus Stables, a dirt corral surrounded by 50 stalls, is now hard to spot among the commercial buildings rising along Veterans Road West. Its owner, Sandy Dono, recalled how until five years ago there were just a few houses and barely a car passing. Horseback riders could trot up the road to the trails in Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve.</p>
        <p>But the woods near the stable were cut down for a postal sorting center, a self-storage company was opened and a giant billboard was put atop a 100-foot column. ''We cried when they cut down the woods,'' Ms. Dono said. Now construction of the mall is making it difficult for riders to reach the trails, though she said city politicians had promised to preserve some access.</p>
        <p>The swallowing up of open space is happening elsewhere as well, and there are house-by-house, neighborhood-by-neighborhood battles.</p>
        <p>Kathleen C. Meaghan, 48, who lives in the same house in Richmondtown her family has owned since 1919, is trying to prevent 15 acres of wetlands and adjacent woods from becoming home plots, arguing that development would pollute gurgling Richmond Creek. The creek is part of the island Bluebelt, a system of protected streams and ponds operated by the city to manage storm water runoff.</p>
        <p>''We want to save our open space, whether it's environmentally significant or it leaves a little breathing room between us,'' she told the revolutionaries at the Save Staten Island meeting last month.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have had their eyes on a large swaths of the west shore between the Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing, much of which has been forsaken by oil storage and other companies. But home builders covet the marshy land, which is zoned for manufacturing but serves as nesting and roosting sites for shore birds. The city's Department of Planning is studying the area.</p>
        <p>One 450-acre swampy region just south of the Goethals Bridge was bought in December by the International Speedway Corporation for $100 million. The company wants to convert the former petroleum tank farm into a three-quarter-mile Nascar racetrack, a beachhead for stock-car racing in the Northeast. Guy V. Molinari, the borough president from 1990 to 2001, is the company's lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burg, Wild Metro's founder, has put together a list of 33 threatened sites -- marshes, creeks, and woodland -- on the island. Still, the site that has received most of his attention has been the proposed Home Depot mall. The Blumenfeld Development Group, which has spent heavily on lobbying, worked out a deal to develop 42 of the 134 acres. The city hopes to use the rest for schools, housing for the elderly and ball fields.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burg has tried to shrink the mall's footprint by arguing that the area is home to a rare species, Torrey's mountain mint, a two-foot-high stalk with an oval seed head that exists in only 20 colonies worldwide. But he has lost in court, and so far has succeeded only in getting the builder to fence off strips of brush where the mint grows.</p>
        <p>A model often cited for protecting open land is the purchase several years ago of 194 acres of Mount Loretto, a onetime Roman Catholic orphanage overlooking Raritan Bay and the Atlantic. The Trust for Public Land, a national conservation group, negotiated a sale with the Archdiocese of New York and got the state to put up the $25 million purchase price.</p>
        <p>Rather than housing, the area is now a refuge of coastal bluffs and moist grasslands that nurture bird species like the bobolink, meadowlark and savannah sparrow.</p>
        <p>Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, thinks the island is not starved for parks. One-quarter, or 9,600 acres, is already parkland, and the conversion of the Fresh Kills landfill will bring the total to 12,000, or 30 percent. And not everyone is happy with all that the protesters have done. Councilman Lanza said the suit to stop the Bricktown mall had stalled not the mall but the building of adjacent ball fields at a time when families must travel to New Jersey to play soccer.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lanza wants to keep something of the Staten Island of his childhood, when he chased frogs and soaked up the island's beauty, yet had enough friends nearby to play sandlot ball.</p>
        <p>''I've talked about the Huckleberryesque, idyllic life I had here,'' he said. ''I've got three kids, aged 7 down to 8 months, and I want to see them grow up in a place that had a certain way of life for raising families.''</p>
