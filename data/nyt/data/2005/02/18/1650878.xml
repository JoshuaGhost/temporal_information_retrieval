        <p>NASA has completed more than half of the recommendations required to resume space shuttle flights and should be able to comply with the rest to begin launches in May or June, an expert advisory panel said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The return-to-flight task force, headed by two former astronauts, Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. Covey, said it had fully approved of NASA's plans to meet 7 of 15 mandatory recommendations of Columbia accident investigators and conditionally approved an eighth.</p>

        <p>NASA has completed more than half of the recommendations required to resume space shuttle flights and should be able to comply with the rest to begin launches in May or June, an expert advisory panel said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The return-to-flight task force, headed by two former astronauts, Thomas P. Stafford and Richard O. Covey, said it had fully approved of NASA's plans to meet 7 of 15 mandatory recommendations of Columbia accident investigators and conditionally approved an eighth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Covey told a telephone news conference that the space agency was close to meeting most of the other requirements, which he said his panel hoped to approve by the end of March at its last scheduled major meeting.</p>
        <p>Shuttles have been grounded since Feb. 1, 2003, when the Columbia disintegrated upon return to Earth when hot gases entered a hole that was found to have been punched into the leading edge of its wing by foam debris on launch. The shuttle's seven-member crew was killed.</p>
        <p>In Thursday's action, the task force approved NASA's plans for between-flight inspections of the wing edge panels and nose cones of shuttles.</p>
        <p>These heat-resistant panels, made of a material called reinforced carbon-carbon, are to be inspected for wear or small cracks by nondestructive methods, including X-rays and ultrasound.</p>
