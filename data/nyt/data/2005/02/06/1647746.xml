      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IN the film ''Big Night,'' the actor and director Stanley Tucci, a co-owner of the two-year-old Finch Tavern, plays the co-owner of a struggling Italian restaurant. His character's brother, the chef, is a dreamer and perfectionist who refuses to bend his standards, even in the face of bankruptcy. ''They should come just-a for the food,'' the chef says of his sometimes indifferent clientele. ''I know,'' replies his brother, ''but they don't.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, if I were to return the popular Finch Tavern, it would be for the valet parking, the lively crowd, the suave décor -- but not necessarily for the food. In ''Big Night,'' a glorious timpano of hand-rolled pasta, hard-cooked eggs and meatballs puts diners in a state of rapture; at Finch Tavern, where the chef, Steve Quattrocchi, procures top-flight ingredients, few dishes had the same power to transport. The ambitious menu, with its offerings of sea scallops with pomegranate and walnut risotto and pan-seared ostrich with molasses chipotle sauce, was a panoply of exotic veneers, but the overall results were so uneven that I found myself crossing my fingers as courses arrived.</p>

        <p>Indeed, if I were to return the popular Finch Tavern, it would be for the valet parking, the lively crowd, the suave décor -- but not necessarily for the food. In ''Big Night,'' a glorious timpano of hand-rolled pasta, hard-cooked eggs and meatballs puts diners in a state of rapture; at Finch Tavern, where the chef, Steve Quattrocchi, procures top-flight ingredients, few dishes had the same power to transport. The ambitious menu, with its offerings of sea scallops with pomegranate and walnut risotto and pan-seared ostrich with molasses chipotle sauce, was a panoply of exotic veneers, but the overall results were so uneven that I found myself crossing my fingers as courses arrived.</p>
        <p>The beautifully understated dining room does nothing if not raise expectations for a fabulous meal. Soothing tones, dark cherry finishes and butterscotch-colored banquettes give the feel of a luxury hotel. Big, square plate-glass windows and a sleek mural of horses add drama. On weekend nights, every table is taken.</p>
        <p>Starters were mostly disappointing. A doleful crab cake bore a price tag of $14.95. In a salad of field greens, the vinaigrette was all but absent, the ''crispy'' goat cheese was not crispy at all, and a spoonful of pithy fruit compote seemed to have landed on the wrong plate. A bland Caesar salad was strewn with sharp olives, and a tuft of watery endive made a poor anchor for a salad that included pears, blue cheese, walnuts and radishes.</p>
        <p>Steamed mussels in a spicy tomato broth studded with chorizo had lost their plumpness. ''Crispy'' calamari breaded with graham cracker crumbs also failed the crispy test, although the squid was tender and flavorful. Perhaps because the kitchen had only to pry them open, shining oysters dipped in a Sauternes mignonette were delicious.</p>
        <p>Entrees showed a surer hand. Two risottos were fully satisfying, one light and fragrant (with shrimp, butternut squash and fresh herbs), the other rich and woodsy (with braised beef and mushrooms). Seared sea scallops bathed in a sweet apple cider reduction were lovely; I liked the surprise of sour pomegranate seeds and earthy walnuts in the accompanying risotto.</p>
        <p>A magnificent grilled veal T-bone was surrounded by tiny brussels sprouts, fava beans, lightly roasted pearl onions and rather heavy sweet potato gnocchi; a citrusy morel vinaigrette tied it all together. Grilled lamb chops on two occasions were very good, spiked with a mint au jus, or served straight up with a vibrant red beet timbale.</p>
        <p>Some entrees lacked balance. Salmon glazed with teriyaki had an attractive sweetness, but the tangle of soba noodles crowding the plate were of little interest. A nice piece of sauteed mahi mahi crusted with pistachios was set in a dull lobster stew.</p>
        <p>The appealing wine list might redeem an evening. A strong selection of wines by the glass included Heidsieck's crisp Monopole Brut ($12) and Sebastiani's velvety 1999 merlot ($9). Two red wines were standout: the elegant 2001 Viader ($140), a cabernet and cabernet franc blend tasting of cocoa and cassis, and Chateau Montelena's 2001 cabernet ($90), with its notes of blackberry and licorice.</p>
        <p>Chipotle chilies are in full vogue, but I didn't expect to find them on my dessert plate. As part of a sour cherry chutney, they brought an off-putting heat to an apple tart (in a one-two punch, the kitchen had worked jalapeño cheese into the tart crust). In contrast, a deconstructed cheesecake -- lemony cream cheese lightened with meringue set on a sugar cookie and garnished with blueberry sorbet, blood orange segments and swizzles of raspberry sauce -- was fun, sophisticated and delicious. An assortment of cookies and truffles featured two charming petit fours; in icing script, one read ''Finch,'' the other ''Tavern.''</p>
