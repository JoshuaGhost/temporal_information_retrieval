        <p>Valine Georgeson letter comments on John Leland's Jan 23 profile of Jay Bakker, son of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and leader of alternative Christian ministry called Revolution</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As a bookstore manager in Atlanta, I was host to a book signing in 2001 with Jay Bakker, as he signed copies of his autobiography (John Leland, Jan. 23). As a Southern liberal, I had often rolled my eyes at the antics of his parents and frankly expected the evening to be a more youthful version of the same. But as Jay Bakker spoke about his life and the extraordinary pain that he had endured, the mockery and rejection, I found myself unexpectedly moved by his story. Here was a young man who had found within himself an enormous capacity for forgiveness. I was ashamed of my own judgmental attitude toward him, and since that evening, I have had nothing but respect for this young man.</p>
        <p>While Jim and Tammy Faye will leave an interesting legacy to American culture, their son will leave the greater gift.</p>
