        <p>Energy, verve and color were hallmarks of art in the German-speaking world between the two world wars. They were nearly eradicated by the proscriptions of the Nazis and had little place in the more dogmatic artistic trends like serialism that sprang up in their wake.</p>
        <p>But increasingly musicians have been trying to restore strains of this so-called degenerate music to their rightful place in the concert repertory. The Tokyo String Quartet, for instance, is devoting its residency at the 92nd Street Y this season to the music of émigré composers. It played Hanns Eisler's Septet No. 2 and Alexander Zemlinsky's Fourth Quartet in the second concert of the series on Saturday night.</p>

        <p>Energy, verve and color were hallmarks of art in the German-speaking world between the two world wars. They were nearly eradicated by the proscriptions of the Nazis and had little place in the more dogmatic artistic trends like serialism that sprang up in their wake.</p>
        <p>But increasingly musicians have been trying to restore strains of this so-called degenerate music to their rightful place in the concert repertory. The Tokyo String Quartet, for instance, is devoting its residency at the 92nd Street Y this season to the music of émigré composers. It played Hanns Eisler's Septet No. 2 and Alexander Zemlinsky's Fourth Quartet in the second concert of the series on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Another émigré tying the season together is Franz Joseph Haydn, who wrote his three Op. 74 quartets for performance in London, where he spent some time at the height of his career. The Tokyo is presenting one quartet from this set at each of its three concerts; on Saturday, it was No. 3, called ''The Rider'' for the galloping rhythms in the final movement.</p>
        <p>It was a program with a lot of nice links. The bounce of the Haydn, for example, echoed that at the close of Eisler's perky septet, which was originally conceived as a score for Charlie Chaplin's silent film ''The Circus'' but had to be abandoned in this form when Eisler was brought before the House Un-American Activities Committee for his Communist beliefs. (He eventually settled in East Germany.)</p>
        <p>The tootlings of a bassoon, a lively clarinet and a twittering flute added a deft circus flavor to the proceedings, beautifully executed by the respected soloists Frank Morelli, Alan R. Kay and Tara Helen O'Connor (looking especially radiant). And the comic element was enhanced by musical one-liners, like a quote from the ''William Tell'' Overture.</p>
        <p>It was a good start to a good night. The quartet seemed particularly ''on,'' and the disparate sounds of the different players, which bothered me in October when I heard the first concert in this series, fused better here.</p>
        <p>The Haydn is an unusual piece. The players bit into its gristly opening with gusto and worked up to an exuberant flambé of a finale. And they did strong justice to the Zemlinsky, a wistful but full-throated eulogy to late Romanticism and a lovely piece of sustained nostalgia.</p>
        <p>The final concert in the Tokyo's series is on May 7 at the Kaufmann Concert Hall, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500.</p>
