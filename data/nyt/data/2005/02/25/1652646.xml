        <p>Pope John Paul II underwent a tracheotomy on Thursday night to ease breathing problems, a serious turn for the worse in the health of the already fragile, 84-year-old spiritual leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics.</p>
        <p>Only two weeks ago, he was released from Gemelli Hospital here in Rome after a nine-day stay, and since then Vatican officials had said he was slowly regaining his health.</p>
        <p>But on Thursday morning, the pope was rushed again to Gemelli with what was described as a new bout of the flu, fever and spasms of the larynx, the same ailments that had forced his first hospitalization on Feb. 1. Then Thursday evening, the Vatican announced that doctors, in response to an ''acute breathing insufficiency,'' had performed a tracheotomy -- cut a hole at the base of the neck directly into the windpipe.</p>
        <p>''The Holy Father was informed and gave his consent,'' the pope's chief spokesman, Joaqu√≠n Navarro-Valls, himself a medical doctor, said in a statement. ''The operation, which began at 8:20 p.m. and ended at 8:50 p.m., was carried out and ended successfully.''</p>
        <p>The pope was conscious and alert after the operation, a top Italian government official said.</p>
        <p>Despite the operation's apparent success, both the procedure and the underlying conditions that made it necessary seem likely to intensify questions about the pope's ability to continue to lead the church if he remains badly debilitated.</p>
        <p>Because the cut is made below the voice box, medical specialists say, people with tracheotomies have difficulty speaking. The procedure, they say, is usually carried out to place the patient on a ventilator. ANSA, an Italian news agency, reported that the pope was placed on a ventilator after the operation.</p>
        <p>In all, the pope's mobility and ability to communicate may be severely hampered, a situation that some officials here have cited as an unexplored worst case for the functioning of the church.</p>
        <p>For years, the Pope has suffered from Parkinson's disease, a neurological deterioration that curbs the ability to control muscles, including those that regulate breathing.</p>
        <p>But John Paul, an athletic man in his youth who remained physically vigorous for decades, has often rallied from what seemed like life-threatening illness. Gianni Letta, a top adviser to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, suggested a positive prognosis after visiting the hospital Thursday night and being briefed by the pope's doctors.</p>
        <p>''Everything seems well to me,'' he told reporters at Gemelli. ''You saw that I too entered very worried, almost gloomy. I leave with my soul relieved and very serene.''</p>
        <p>''I saw him,'' he added. ''He is well and serene.''</p>
        <p>He said the pope had tried to speak to him but had been told not to by his doctors. He said doctors had told him that the pope joked before the operation, after being told it would be a small one.</p>
        <p>''Small, it depends for whom,'' the pope said, according to the account.</p>
        <p>The news of the pope's second hospitalization in so short a time sparked expressions of concern, from his hometown, Wadowice, Poland, to Africa, Southeast Asia, as well as in Gemelli hospital, about two miles from the Vatican.</p>
        <p>''It is not a good sign that he is back,'' said Paula Ferrara, 32, a doctor at Gemelli who is not involved in the pope's treatment. ''People with Parkinson's are very sensitive to breathing problems, and any spasm in his throat, even something like a bad cough, could stop him from breathing.''</p>
        <p>Still, she said, ''paradoxically, it's a really lovely atmosphere when the pope is here, because the patients are more concentrated on the pope's health than on their own sicknesses -- they forget for a while.''</p>
        <p>John Paul's last hospitalization set off complicated reactions and emotions in the Vatican and among many of the faithful -- ones that are likely to grow stronger with this relapse. As never before, the question of a papal resignation -- something John Paul said he would never entertain -- has been discussed, with questions about how well, or how long, a very sick pope can remain at the church's helm.</p>
        <p>But Vatican officials have argued that the pope's public struggle with age and sickness sets its own example, one that an American visitor walking with the help of a cane, out of a winter rain into St. Peter's Basilica, said was important.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a wonderful example that you don't have to give up and curl up in a corner,'' said the visitor, Paula Brown, 50, a Catholic pilgrim from Colorado visiting Rome with a church group.</p>
        <p>''I think it will be sad when he is gone because we love him,'' she said. But she added, ''It just doesn't feel like it is this time.''</p>
        <p>Since he was released from the hospital two weeks ago, the pope has held a minimum of audiences and public appearances -- not unusual at the start of the Lenten season.</p>
        <p>But on Wednesday, amid high winds and rain in Rome, he did not appear in person at his usual Wednesday general audience, addressing pilgrims instead by closed circuit television. He wheezed as he spoke, reading greetings in several languages, but looked as he generally has in these last few years of serious illness: weak but alert, if a bit thinner than usual.</p>
        <p>''I greet with affection all of you gathered for the usual Wednesday meeting,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On Thursday morning, he was scheduled to attend a ceremony near his apartments in the Vatican to approve decrees for sainthood. But a few minutes before, his condition worsened, and he was taken to the hospital, Reuters reported, citing unidentified Vatican officials.</p>
        <p>Religious and political leaders in Italy and abroad sent messages of good wishes.</p>
        <p>''We hope the pope recovers as soon as possible,'' said Fred Jones, a spokesman for President Bush, who is in Slovakia on the last leg of a trip to Europe. ''He's in our thoughts and prayers.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan, sent wishes at a funeral in Milan for a prominent Italian priest, Luigi Giussani, which was attended by many of the nation's political leaders, including Mr. Berlusconi.</p>
        <p>''To the Holy Father, our affection, wishes for his health and prayers go out in this, yet another trying moment,'' said Cardinal Tettamanzi, who is considered a contender to become the next pope.</p>
