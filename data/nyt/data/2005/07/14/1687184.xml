        <p>Despite their high-resolution images, film cameras suffer from a basic problem: a frustratingly small viewfinder that you must align with your eyeball. Digital cameras changed that with liquid-crystal displays. But these neat mini-TV's tend to be thirsty for battery power, compelling many digital shooters to resort to the thumbnail viewfinder.</p>
        <p>Samsung's Pro815 has innovations that address both problems. It features a high-capacity lithium-ion battery that powers up to 500 shots a charge. And with its impressive 3.5-inch display -- as much screen real estate as you get in some bulky photo vaults -- you may never want to bend your nose against the back of the camera again.</p>

        <p>The camera has a 15X optical zoom lens, uses Compact Flash storage cards and has a shutter lag of only half a second.</p>
        <p>The Pro815 will be available next month for $849, certainly pricier than basic point-and-shoot models. But if you calculate the costs of broken eyeglasses from jamming your face into a camera back, it may not be a bad deal.</p>
