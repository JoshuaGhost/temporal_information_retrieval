        <p>James Lipton, intense, erudite host of Bravo program Inside the Actors Studio, is featured in series of humorous television commercials for DC Shoes line of footwear, apparel and gear sold by Quicksilver; he is incongruously paired in commercials with various well-known figures from world of extreme sports; photo (M)</p>

        <p>IF you heard that James Lipton, the intense, erudite host of ''Inside the Actors Studio,'' was interviewing a blue-chip lineup of stars, you would normally not go wrong by expecting them to bear names like Cruise, Newman and Streisand. But a series of humorous television commercials that began running this week plays switcheroo with those expectations, incongruously pairing Mr. Lipton with stars named Dyrdek, Pastrana and Way.</p>
        <p>The stars, who are as laid back as Mr. Lipton is buttoned down, are not some of the famous film personalities whom he regularly quizzes on his series on the Bravo cable network. Rather, they are well-known in the world of extreme sports. In addition to Rob Dyrdek, a skateboarder; Travis Pastrana, a motocross racer; and Danny Way, the skateboarder who recently jumped the Great Wall of China, the 18 commercials feature Bruce Irons, a surfer; Dave Mirra, a BMX biker; and Travis Rice, a snowboarder.</p>

        <p>IF you heard that James Lipton, the intense, erudite host of ''Inside the Actors Studio,'' was interviewing a blue-chip lineup of stars, you would normally not go wrong by expecting them to bear names like Cruise, Newman and Streisand. But a series of humorous television commercials that began running this week plays switcheroo with those expectations, incongruously pairing Mr. Lipton with stars named Dyrdek, Pastrana and Way.</p>
        <p>The stars, who are as laid back as Mr. Lipton is buttoned down, are not some of the famous film personalities whom he regularly quizzes on his series on the Bravo cable network. Rather, they are well-known in the world of extreme sports. In addition to Rob Dyrdek, a skateboarder; Travis Pastrana, a motocross racer; and Danny Way, the skateboarder who recently jumped the Great Wall of China, the 18 commercials feature Bruce Irons, a surfer; Dave Mirra, a BMX biker; and Travis Rice, a snowboarder.</p>
        <p>The spots, by an agency in El Segundo, Calif., named 72 and Sunny, promote the DC Shoes line of footwear, apparel and gear endorsed by the athletes and sold by Quiksilver. The campaign is the third of three with a $1 million budget that DC is running this summer; the ads are appearing on ESPN, ESPN2, MTV, MTV2 and the DC Shoes Web site (dcshoes.com).</p>
        <p>Mr. Lipton said he believed the campaign represented his first advertising work in a long career as an academic, actor, author, playwright and producer.</p>
        <p>How is it that someone known more for talking about X-rated movies than the X Games is featured in a campaign aimed at sports participants and fans ages 14 to 22? The goal is for the commercials to stand out in a sea of look-alike spots that typically present 29 seconds of film of a wild skateboard, snowboard or surf stunt before ending with a second-long shot of a brand logo.</p>
        <p>''I challenged our agency: 'We've pretty much got the dream team in action sports, and kids have seen footage of them but have never been exposed to their personalities,''' said Mark Woolsey, vice president for marketing at DC Shoes. ''They came to me with James Lipton, and it took me all of 10 seconds to realize it was an unbelievable concept.''</p>
        <p>''Even though his program is geared more for adults, he has become a pop culture icon,'' Mr. Woolsey said, citing the Will Ferrell parodies of Mr. Lipton on ''Saturday Night Live'' and his appearances on TV shows and in movies.</p>
        <p>''And the contrast with our athletes is brilliant,'' Mr. Woolsey said, ''juxtaposing the world he comes from and the world they come from.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, there is distance between those worlds.</p>
        <p>''I got a call from ICM, which represents me,'' Mr. Lipton said, referring to the talent agency, ''saying, 'DC Shoes,' and I said, 'What is that?'''</p>
        <p>Still, the idea appealed to him, Mr. Lipton said, because it fit with efforts by him and Bravo, part of the NBC Universal division of General Electric, to ''broaden the demographic range'' of ''Inside the Actors Studio.''</p>
        <p>The set used in the commercials aimed to evoke but not copy the set of ''Inside the Actors Studio,'' at Mr. Lipton's request. He is always seen dressed in a suit and tie, while the athletes are casual incarnate in various DC outfits.</p>
        <p>''We were looking for a way to serve up the athletes so their real, natural personalities could shine through,'' said John Boiler, co-creative director at 72 and Sunny who is also a founder of the agency. ''And people are used to James Lipton serving up our cultural icons.''</p>
        <p>The dialogue in the commercials is a mix of scripted lines from 72 and Sunny and lines improvised on the set, Mr. Lipton and Mr. Woolsey said. (''I love to improvise,'' Mr. Lipton said.) The humor ranges from subtle to silly, with the delivery of punch lines passed from Mr. Lipton to the athletes and back again.</p>
        <p>For instance, in one spot, Mr. Lipton asks Mr. Mirra: ''Dave, here's an interesting question. Is your video game you better than the real you?'' Mr. Mirra replies, ''It hurts less, but you got the motion captured from the real guy.'' In another spot, Mr. Way and Mr. Lipton acknowledge Mr. Way's Great Wall stunt by saying hello to each other in Chinese.</p>
        <p>In a third commercial, Mr. Lipton praises Mr. Irons's victory in a tournament, declaring it ''sick.'' Mr. Irons echoes him but draws out the ''i's'' laconically to make it sound like ''siiiiick.'' This is the exchange that follows between Mr. Lipton and Mr. Irons: ''Hmmm?'' ''Sick.'' ''You agree.'' ''I agree.'' ''It was sick.'' ''Sick.'' ''Sick.'' ''Sick.'' ''Sick.'' ''Sick.''</p>
        <p>The most Liptonesque of the spots may be one in which Mr. Lipton challenges Mr. Dyrdek by asserting, ''You're just a pest, a pain in the neck and people chase you.'' Mr. Dyrdek, unfazed, replies that he now has ''my own security guard to deal with security guards.'' The guard suddenly comes out on stage; Mr. Lipton stands and shakes his hand.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I was in a parallel universe when I was sitting there and he was talking to me,'' Mr. Dyrdek said in a telephone interview. ''It was like 'when worlds collide,' almost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dyrdek said that ''of course'' he knew who Mr. Lipton was before filming the spots, but ''it was like more Will Ferrell was James Lipton to me.''</p>
        <p>As for whether fans of Mr. Dyrdek and the other extreme athletes know Mr. Lipton, ''I'm thinking 50-50,'' Mr. Dyrdek said, adding: ''For those who do know, it's that much more 'wow.' But you don't necessarily need to know who he is because someone will tell you and you'll say, 'Oh, that's crazy.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dyrdek said he enjoyed the filming but believed that Mr. Lipton ''was frustrated with me.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't like what I was saying, and he gave me some advice,'' Mr. Dyrdek recalled. ''And I said, 'Mr. Lipton, I appreciate that advice but this isn't a real interview.'''</p>
        <p>Even if the campaign is wildly successful, Mr. Woolsey of DC Shoes said, there is no chance the company would produce a line of Lipton merchandise. ''I don't think we're going to go to that extreme,'' he said, laughing.</p>
