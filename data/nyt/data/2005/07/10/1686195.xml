        <p>The 1930 film version was Garbo's first talkie: her opening lines: ''Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side. And don't be stingy, baby.'' The play had its first out-of-town tryout in Atlantic City. Ms. Stahlhuth, who adores the ocean, was born in Indiana. ''I started crawling east when I was a baby,'' she said. Through July 16; (609)884-5898.</p>
