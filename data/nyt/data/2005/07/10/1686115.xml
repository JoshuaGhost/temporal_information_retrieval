        <p>FIVE shaggy British guys who make up the band Kasabian ambled out of the Hotel Triton here a few weeks ago and clambered into a van. In the middle of a grueling months-long world tour for their self-titled debut album, they finally had a bit of downtime and decided -- of all possible things -- to spend it visiting Alcatraz.</p>

        <p>FIVE shaggy British guys who make up the band Kasabian ambled out of the Hotel Triton here a few weeks ago and clambered into a van. In the middle of a grueling months-long world tour for their self-titled debut album, they finally had a bit of downtime and decided -- of all possible things -- to spend it visiting Alcatraz.</p>
        <p>As the van wound its way through the city's hilly streets, the band's tour manager, Brett Spence, tried to dictate the backstage needs for that evening's show over his cellphone to the club promoter. His task was made more difficult by a steady stream of interruptions from Tom Meighan, the group's frontman and resident goofball.</p>
        <p>''We need Coronas, lots of them, and limes, and a plate of cheese and meats,'' Mr. Spence began.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meighan said, ''The finest meats available.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence added, ''Yes, and some of those Cheetie-os, the umm, Chereetos, Churitos!''</p>
        <p>''You mean Cheetos,'' Mr. Meighan said helpfully, ''the fiery hot ones, they burn your lips and make your hands red.''</p>
        <p>The van arrived at the wharf, and the gang boarded the ferry for the 1.5- mile trip to the island of Alcatraz.</p>
        <p>On the crossing Sergio Pizzorno, Kasabian's songwriter-guitarist-heartthrob, expounded on what every rock star needs: ''Gotta have the right shoes, the right jeans, the right haircut. But most of all, you have to have mojo. And we have mojo for days.''</p>
        <p>Kasabian's album has reached platinum status in England and has sold more than 150,000 copies in the United States propelled by the lead single ''Club Foot,'' a hive of buzzing guitars and tribal beats that manages to be simultaneously foreboding and danceable. Tracks from their album have played on some of the top hits on American television, ''Desperate Housewives,'' ''The O.C.'' and ''C.S.I.,'' and the band landed a plum spot opening for Oasis this fall.</p>
        <p>Though the band's name sounds sinister (the guitarist, Christopher Karloff, was reading a book about the Manson killings, and the name Linda Kasabian jumped out at him), the band members -- who also include Chris Edwards, the bassist -- are surprisingly affable. All but the drummer, Ian Matthews, grew up together in Leicester, a small English town, and all, in their early 20's, use the phrase ''Innit?'' with frequency.</p>
        <p>At Alcatraz their chatter ceased when they donned headphones for the prison tour, narrated by former inmates and guards. The group checked out the Rock's tiny cells, the barbershop, the cafeteria, the library, the exercise yards, gun turrets and a gallery of the more infamous inmates, including Machine Gun Kelly, Robert Stroud (the Birdman) and Al Capone.</p>
        <p>Tour completed, the mood was pensive. ''It's a really dark place, innit?'' Mr. Pizzorno said. ''Lot of old souls there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence, the tour manager, appeared, tapping his watch: ''The ferry leaves in two minutes. We don't want to get stuck here and miss the show.'' They hustled down the hill, just in time to miss the boat. Fortunately there was one last ferry departure scheduled, and the band made it to the club, called 330 Ritch, with time to spare.</p>
        <p>After the sold-out show, the mood was buoyant. Mr. Meighan declared it their ''best show yet.'' Mr. Pizzorno said: ''I could live here. Either here or Paris. But the exchange rate here is so good, I can get two guitars for the price of one.'' He laughed. ''One to smash and one to keep.''</p>
