        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Financially Set, Grandparents Help Keep Families Afloat, Too'' (front page, July 14):</p>
        <p>I am one of those grandparents who are providing financial assistance to grandchildren.</p>
        <p>My husband and I experienced the Great Depression, were poor much of our lives and as a consequence, were careful with money. We never bought more than we could afford, and we saved, saved, saved.</p>
        <p>So we are financially secure come what may.</p>
        <p>But we want to shield our grandchildren from the damage that the Bush administration is wreaking on the middle class. Rather than having our children and grandchildren wait until our deaths to receive an inheritance, we decided to help now, when this assistance is needed.</p>
        <p>I am determined that our grandchildren will have the background and tools they need to contribute to society and will not have to struggle to stay in the middle class.</p>
        <p>I have made it clear that there are no strings attached; it just makes me happy to be able to do this.</p>
