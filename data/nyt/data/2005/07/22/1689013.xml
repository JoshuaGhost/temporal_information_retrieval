      <block class="full_text">
        <p>President Horst Köhler announced Thursday that he had dissolved the German Parliament and called for early national elections, moving the vote for chancellor up by a year.</p>
        <p>Speaking on national television on Thursday night, Mr. Köhler agreed with an unusual proposal by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who announced nearly two months ago that he could no longer govern effectively and would seek a new mandate in early elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Köhler's announcement, which ended weeks of speculation and suspense about what his decision would be, means that elections, which normally would have been held in the fall of 2006, now must be held within 60 days. Mr. Köhler said the election date would be Sept. 18.</p>
        <p>''Our country is facing gigantic challenges,'' he said. ''Our future and that of our children are at stake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Köhler said that with Mr. Schröder, who now holds only a slim majority in Parliament, and his party threatened by ''abstentions and resignations'' from within its own ranks, his government no longer had a ''steady and reliable'' basis for governing. At a time when millions are unemployed and Germany is facing what Mr. Köhler called ''fierce competition'' from abroad, ''our country needs a government that can pursue its aims with continuity and vigor.''</p>
        <p>Under German law, the president is the only person who can dissolve the German Parliament.</p>
        <p>The public opinion polls for the last several months have shown Mr. Schröder's opponent, Angela Merkel, head of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, to be a strong favorite in the election, even though she trails Mr. Schröder in personal popularity polls. According to the most recent polls, her conservative coalition, which is paired with the Christian Social Union in Bavaria, is preferred by about 44 percent of voters, compared with 27 percent who support Mr. Schröder's Social Democrats.</p>
        <p>In addition, defectors from Mr. Schröder's own party, who are led by a former German finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, have joined forces in recent weeks with the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to the old East German Communist Party, to form a new leftist movement that could draw support away from the Social Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schröder's call for early elections came after a string of defeats in state elections in Germany, culminating in his party's loss of control of the country's biggest and most industrialized state, North-Rhine Westphalia, which had been controlled by the Social Democrats for 39 years until the Christian Democratic victory there in May.</p>
        <p>Despite those losses, there has been much speculation why Mr. Schröder would seek early elections that could result in a loss of power for him a year early. Some political analysts believe that Mr. Schröder had become genuinely discouraged with his inability to win support within his own party for his policies, which include a series of cutbacks in social welfare benefits, known as Agenda 2010, that the chancellor has said are necessary for the near moribund German economy to recover its competitiveness.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as Mr. Köhler said in his speech on Thursday, Mr. Schröder faced defections from his party that threatened to eliminate his thin majority in Parliament, which would have required him to cede power in any case.</p>
        <p>Early elections have been held only twice in Germany's postwar history: in 1972, while Willy Brandt was chancellor, and in 1983, when Helmut Kohl, who had become chancellor because of a party realignment in Parliament, sought to strengthen his political position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schröder got his own party formally to oppose him in a parliamentary vote of confidence three weeks ago. That satisfied the early-elections provision in Germany's Basic Law, which states that the chancellor must lose the support of his own majority, and therefore the ability to govern, for elections to be called ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>But all along questions have been raised about the legality of the maneuver, which some politicians and constitutional experts said satisfied the letter of the law but not its spirit.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Köhler said, ''I have respect for all those who have doubts about a 'yes,' but I'm convinced that my decision is in line with the Basic Law.''</p>
        <p>Still, the choice was clearly a difficult one for Mr. Köhler. If he had said no to the early election plan, he might have satisfied the constitutional strict constructionists in Germany, but he would at the same time have consigned the country to a year of lame-duck rule by a chancellor who has himself admitted that he can no longer govern effectively without a new mandate.</p>
