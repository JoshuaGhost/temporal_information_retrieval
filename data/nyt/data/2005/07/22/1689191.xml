        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a former state auditor and audit supervisor, I can see that the Medicaid audit function is woefully lacking. Simple ''exception reports'' should have pointed out potential areas of fraud well before the amounts billed by Dr. Dolly Rosen, the dentist mentioned in your series on Medicaid, became excessive.</p>
        <p>A quick trip to Dr. Rosen's office would have disclosed that the number of patients for whom claims were submitted was excessive, and a full audit could have been ordered.</p>
        <p>If auditors do not have exception reports at their fingertips, Medicaid is well behind the times.</p>
        <p>I recently concluded my financial career at a large state agency at which all financial employees had online access to all financial data.</p>
