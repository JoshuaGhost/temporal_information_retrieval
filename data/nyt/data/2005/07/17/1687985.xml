        <p>They aren't quite the Brontës, but the Clark women never seem to run out of stories to spin.</p>
        <p>Mary Higgins Clark, who lives in Saddle River and summers in Spring Lake, just published her latest novel, ''No Place Like Home,'' in April, and her daughter Carol Higgins Clark, who now lives in New York City but still writes about New Jersey, came out with ''Burned'' in March.</p>
        <p>Then there's Mary Jane Clark of Hillsdale, who is more of a writing Clark by proxy.</p>
        <p>Her eighth and latest novel, ''Dancing in the Dark,'' is being published this month by St. Martin's. Mary Jane Clark is divorced from Mary Higgins Clark's son, David, but declined to give up on the name even as she gave up on the marriage. She is the first to admit that the Clark ''brand'' certainly hasn't damaged her writing career.</p>
        <p>Matthew Shear, publisher of St. Martin's, said: ''Clearly there is some connection, which didn't hurt matters with our accounts in the early days. But, it really began with a good book.''</p>
        <p>''Dancing in the Dark,'' about a killer on the loose in Ocean Grove, will have a first printing of 80,000 copies -- Mary Jane Clark's best showing yet. Still, that's not quite in the league of her former mother-in-law -- known for novels like ''A Stranger Is Watching'' and ''The Cradle Will Fall'' -- and sister-in-law, who are mainstays on the best-seller lists.</p>
        <p>Mary Jane Clark says Mary Higgins Clark taught her dedication to writing by example. ''Everyone knew when she had a book due,'' Mary Jane said. ''I can remember in the summer the family would be sunbathing on the deck, and she'd be in her office working.''</p>
        <p>And what about their relationship since she and David divorced in 1991? Mary Higgins Clark blurbed her first novel, Mary Jane said, but has not been involved with her career since.</p>
        <p>And you thought your family was weird. What does Mary Jane make of the situation at this point? She just laughed and said, ''I'd imagine it's even stranger for my ex-husband to walk into a store and see his mother, sister and ex-wife all sharing the same shelf.''</p>
