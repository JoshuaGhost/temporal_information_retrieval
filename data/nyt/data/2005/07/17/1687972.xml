        <p>Depressed already, we stirred ourselves to read the study, commissioned by the Pace Academy for the Environment in Pleasantville. A desultory scan was all it took to confirm the discouraging conclusion: after several decades of battling rapacious development and industrial pollution, with legal victory piled upon victory in leading the rest of the nation toward a cleaner, greener future, the environmental movement along the Hudson has hit slack tide as far as the public mood is concerned.</p>

        <p>Here is a headline that went out with a recent press release bearing the usual damp-and-cloudy tidings so favored by environmental organizations:</p>
        <p>''Latest Pace Poll Finds Complacency On Environmental Issues''</p>
        <p>Depressed already, we stirred ourselves to read the study, commissioned by the Pace Academy for the Environment in Pleasantville. A desultory scan was all it took to confirm the discouraging conclusion: after several decades of battling rapacious development and industrial pollution, with legal victory piled upon victory in leading the rest of the nation toward a cleaner, greener future, the environmental movement along the Hudson has hit slack tide as far as the public mood is concerned.</p>
        <p>Asked to identify the most important issues on their minds, the respondents -- 608 New Yorkers in the Hudson River region in a wide range from young to old, working class to rich -- ranked the environment as a middling priority. When asked to rank specific concerns, respondents put water quality low on the list. They seemed neither interested in nor worried about the Indian Point nuclear plant, despite intense efforts by river groups and the county executive, Andrew Spano, to depict it as a hulking environmental menace and terrorist bait.</p>
        <p>While most respondents believed that the local environment was in ''very good'' or ''excellent'' shape, other findings were frustratingly at odds with such satisfaction. Only 30 percent of respondents rated the Hudson River's condition as ''good'' or ''excellent,'' and 75 percent believe, not entirely correctly, that it is unsafe to eat fish from the river. A majority favored some industrial development on the Hudson shoreline, and 50 percent believed that PCB's would never be removed.</p>
        <p>These results might make any environmentalist despondent. But John Cronin, director of the Pace Academy, says it is possible to extract some encouragement, if not inspiration, from them. Mr. Cronin, a veteran of the early days of the movement to save the Hudson, knows that environmentalists do not do well by dwelling obsessively on the negative. He points to one number that is bracingly at odds with the humdrum moderation of the poll's overall findings.</p>
        <p>It is this: 96 percent of respondents said that all dumping of pollutants into the Hudson River should be outlawed.</p>
        <p>If you thought that polluting the Hudson was already illegal, you were wrong -- but so were 84 percent of those surveyed. In fact, the federal Clean Water Act regulates but does not completely ban the discharge of pollutants into national waterways. State and federal agencies allow the dumping of millions of pounds of industrial and municipal wastes into the Hudson every year.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Cronin points out, the country failed to meet, and then forgot about, a stunningly bold objective of the Clean Water Act of 1972: ''It is the national goal that the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by 1985.'' This year is the 20th anniversary of that failure.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Cronin, this means we should set our ambitions higher. Since zero discharge was the centerpiece of the Clean Water Act, he says, it should be the centerpiece of the Hudson's future, with the elimination of dumping into the river by 2020. This would be achieved not through legislation -- this is the Bush era, remember -- but by a voluntary coalition of industry leaders, engineers, scientists, policy makers and environmental advocates, establishing what Mr. Cronin calls a ''platinum standard'' and setting an example for the nation. It would render pollution regulations obsolete.</p>
        <p>Polluters seldom clean up their acts voluntarily; for this to work the State of New York would need to tighten and enforce its rules on dumping. And industry is only one of an array of challenges to the river's health. There is also runoff of sewage and fertilizers; power plants that discharge hot water and kill untold numbers of fish and fish eggs; and, of course, the enduring stain of PCB's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cronin has set a crazily ambitious goal. But since the public already accepts it, half the battle is already won. Time now for the other half.</p>
