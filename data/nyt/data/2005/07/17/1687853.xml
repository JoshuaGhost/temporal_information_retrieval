        <p>A suicide bomber wrapped in explosives detonated himself next to a gasoline tanker south of Baghdad on Saturday night, creating a devastating fireball that killed at least 59 and wounded 86 , an Iraqi police official said.</p>
        <p>The bombing, one the most deadly suicide attacks since the American invasion of Iraq, appeared to target a nearby Shiite mosque and a crowded open-air market and came as the streets teemed with cars, pedestrians, shoppers and worshipers enjoying the relative cool of the evening.</p>
        <p>The bombing, in Musayyib, about 40 miles south of the capital, was the latest in an unrelenting string of dramatic suicide bombings that have killed scores of people and severely challenged the American command, which only a month ago claimed that military offensives had sharply undermined the ability of the insurgents to launch attacks and cut the number of suicide bombings in half.</p>
        <p>Earlier on Saturday, another bomber strapped with explosives blew himself up next to a police station in Mosul, killing five Iraqi police officers.</p>
        <p>In Baghdad, which has has been subjected to a surge in suicide attacks, there were two strikes. In one, a bomber driving a minibus attacked an American military convoy, wounding a civilian, an official at the Interior Ministry said. Several hours later, a car bomber attacked a convoy of commandos from the Interior Ministry in the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad, killing two commandos and wounding 11, including 4 civilians, the official said.</p>
        <p>The surge in suicide attacks in Baghdad began last Sunday, when an attacker detonated an explosive vest outside an Iraqi Army recruiting center, killing at least 23 volunteers and wounding at least 40 others. On Wednesday, a car bomb aimed at an American unit on patrol killed more than two dozen people, most of them Iraqi children; on Thursday, there was a triple attack on a checkpoint leading into the Green Zone government compound; and on Friday, there was a daylong blitz in Baghdad in which at least 8 suicide car bombs killed 22 people.</p>
        <p>Also on Saturday, three British soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded in the south.</p>
        <p>An American soldier was killed and two others wounded by a roadside bomb on Saturday afternoon in Kirkuk Province, the military reported early Sunday without issuing further details about the incident.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the American military command said 11 American soldiers were under investigation after another soldier in their company complained that Iraqis had been assaulted after they were caught during what military officials said was an attack on a power plant in southern Baghdad. The officials did not offer details but said none of the detainees required medical treatment for injuries.</p>
        <p>Suicide bombers -- including those who drive vehicles packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and those wearing body belts fashioned from explosives and tightly packed ball bearings -- have become the top operational priority of American commanders, who have referred to the suicide bomb as the insurgents' ''precision-guided weapon.''</p>
        <p>The attack in Musayyib was the most deadly suicide bombing since May 4, when a bomber pretending to be a job seeker blew himself up outside a police recruiting center in Erbil, the Kurdish provincial capital, killing at least 60 Kurds. As many as 70 people were killed in Baquba last July when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive-packed sedan on a busy street.</p>
        <p>The American and Iraqi military commands have been unable to figure out how to fight what appears to be a prolific industry producing car bombs, which American officials say can be assembled and armed in less than an hour.</p>
        <p>The authorities have found it equally difficult to stem the seemingly steady stream of bombers willing to sacrifice their lives for the Sunni Arab-led insurgency, which is trying to destabilize the new American-backed government, dominated by Shiites and Kurds.</p>
        <p>It was unclear why the insurgents decided to launch this flurry of bloody attacks this week, but many Iraqis had been anticipating a spike in violence tied to Sunday, the anniversary of the 1968 Baathist revolution that ushered Saddam Hussein's political party into power. Officials say many of the top leaders of the insurgency are Baathists.</p>
        <p>The abuse charges on Saturday against the 11 American soldiers stemmed from an incident that, according to Lt. Col. Clifford Kent, a spokesman for the American military in Baghdad, occurred shortly after seven detainees were captured ''in the act of attacking'' a power plant in the Dora neighborhood of south Baghdad on June 20.</p>
        <p>The uncovering of other cases of American and British abuse against Iraqi detainees, particularly the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib disclosed last year, has cost the American military support among Iraqis and goodwill worldwide. The accusations by a soldier that his fellow soldiers had abused detainees compelled the military to take the extraordinary step of removing the entire company of about 100 soldiers from active duty while the investigation was under way, the military said.</p>
        <p>Six of the detainees were eventually released to the Iraqi police, and the seventh remains in the custody of allied forces, Colonel Kent said.</p>
        <p>The charges, if proved, could lead to a range of punishments, or could result in a court-martial.</p>
        <p>In the other violence on Saturday, the three British soldiers were killed and two others wounded by a roadside bomb in Maysan Province.</p>
        <p>The British military said the attack against its troops happened early Saturday morning on a road in Amara, a mostly Shiite city near the Iranian border. It brought the number of British deaths in Iraq since the 2003 invasion to 92.</p>
        <p>In a Web posting, a group calling itself Imam al-Hussein Brigade, apparently a reference to a martyr revered by Shiites, claimed responsibility for that attack.</p>
        <p>Several militant factions operating in southern Iraq are splinter groups of the organization of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr that British officials believe may be behind other recent attacks on their troops.</p>
        <p>After the January elections, Mr. Sadr gained control of the Maysan provincial council and broke off formal relations with the British command, Sheik Abdul Sattar al-Bahadli, a senior Sadr representative in Basra, said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>In political developments on Saturday, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari led a high-level delegation to Iran for a three-day trip intended to mend relations. The new Iraqi government has sought to repair ties with Iran and end tensions that peaked during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988. Prime Minister Jaafari's three-day visit is his first to Iran in his new official role.</p>
        <p>During Saddam Hussein's rule, Iran was a haven for many Shiite opposition leaders, including Mr. Jaafari, and Iran was among the first to recognize the Iraqi government.</p>
        <p>Iran promised last week to contribute $1 billion to Iraqi reconstruction efforts after Defense Minister Sadoun al-Dulaimi of Iraq made a formal apology for the war crimes committed under Mr. Hussein and pledged not to allow Iraqi soil to be used for attacks against Iran.</p>
        <p>In a major agreement announced this month, the countries agreed to build a pipeline between the two southern cities of Basra in Iraq and Abadan in Iran to trade oil.</p>
        <p>The two countries resumed diplomatic ties in 2003, when Foreign Minister Naji Sabri went to Iran. But the two countries have not yet signed a peace treaty. Iraq has also demanded that Iran return 22 planes that Mr. Hussein sent to Iran before the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Iran has said it will return the planes only if the United Nations asks for them.</p>
        <p>The United States has accused Iran of meddling in affairs of Iraq, but the departing Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, said last week that Iran did not want to export its Islamic revolution. In Iraq, he said, ''Even though the majority of Iraqis are Shiite, we never allowed ourselves to impose our model on them.''</p>
