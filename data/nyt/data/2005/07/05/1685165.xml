        <p>If Hollywood was looking for some good news this weekend to relieve the drumbeat of despair over a box office malaise, it didn't find it.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Steven Spielberg juggernaut ''War of the Worlds,'' a science-fiction spectacular starring Tom Cruise, opened strongly, taking in an estimated $113.3 million over six days in the United States and an estimated $102 million in 78 other countries around the world.</p>
        <p>But that figure came nowhere close to matching the box office impact of last year's juggernaut at this time, ''Spider-Man 2,'' which took in $180 million domestically over the same period. The total domestic box office for this year remains about 7 percent behind last year's, with little sign of that being about to change.</p>
        <p>Still, executives at Paramount, which together with DreamWorks produced ''War of the Worlds,'' based on the novel by H.G. Wells, said they were thrilled at its performance. There was much speculation within the industry that Mr. Cruise's public behavior in the weeks leading up to the movie's release, in which he slammed psychiatry and psychiatric drugs in interviews and paraded his relationship with the actress Katie Holmes, might hurt the movie.</p>
        <p>Paramount executives said they saw no evidence of that. ''There's no way to calculate it, but logic would tell you, 'No,''' said Rob Friedman, vice chairman of the motion picture group at Paramount. ''His audience came out in greater numbers than ever before. I think the world separates the star and celebrity from a movie actor and the performance on screen, and this shows that completely.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agreed with this analysis, though, given the strong but not stellar domestic showing of the film.</p>
        <p>''It might have taken people on the fence and pushed them away,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office for the studios. ''Those who had in mind that they wanted to see the movie, it didn't have any effect. But if you're a person who has a strong feeling about what Tom Cruise said, you might say, 'I don't want to support that movie.'''</p>
        <p>Either way, other movies in the summer marketplace were underwhelming. ''Rebound,'' 20th Century Fox's basketball comedy starring Martin Lawrence, had a weak opening, taking in just $6 million.</p>
        <p>And Sony's big summer bet, ''Bewitched,'' and Disney's family-friendly ''Herbie: Fully Loaded'' drew only moderate audiences this weekend. ''Bewitched,'' with an estimated budget of $85 million, dropped 46 percent in its second weekend, for an estimated total of $40 million, while ''Herbie'' had a smaller drop-off but was in over 300 more theaters. Its box office total so far is at $36.8 million.</p>
        <p>At this point, 26 weeks into the year and with many of the summer's biggest movies already rolled out, Hollywood executives seem resigned to the strong possibility that the overall box office for the year may be well behind 2004's.</p>
        <p>''We could be moving toward a down year, but that doesn't paint the picture for next year or two to come,'' said Dan Fellman, president of theatrical distribution for Warner Brothers. If the downward trend continued for another year, he said, executives would probably reconsider the industry shift toward releasing DVD's as close to the movie's opening date in theaters as they do now. Some experts suggest that moviegoers are staying away from theaters because they prefer to see movies at home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dergarabedian said it was unlikely that the box office could make up its lost ground between now and the end of the year. ''We've got six months to get out of a 10 percent attendance deficit,'' he said. ''That's going to take a lot of hard work. I don't see any end of this down streak for a long time to come.''</p>
