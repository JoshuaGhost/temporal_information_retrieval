        <p>Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic candidate for mayor, received endorsements yesterday from two ministers of largely black congregations, a sign that his campaign was recovering from his controversial remarks that the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was not a crime.</p>
        <p>The ministers, the Rev. Adolph Roberts Jr., of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Harlem and the Rev. Gary V. Simpson, of Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn, said yesterday that they were supporting Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, because of his focus on civic and community issues like education and creating economic opportunities for the disadvantaged.</p>

        <p>Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic candidate for mayor, received endorsements yesterday from two ministers of largely black congregations, a sign that his campaign was recovering from his controversial remarks that the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was not a crime.</p>
        <p>The ministers, the Rev. Adolph Roberts Jr., of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Harlem and the Rev. Gary V. Simpson, of Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn, said yesterday that they were supporting Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, because of his focus on civic and community issues like education and creating economic opportunities for the disadvantaged.</p>
        <p>''Whether our members have been serving the elderly, reaching out to the less fortunate or encouraging better financial education as a part of community growth, Freddy Ferrer has fought alongside us,'' said Mr. Simpson, whose congregation numbers almost 4,000, he added.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Ferrer, speaking to reporters after receiving the endorsements, took a dig at one of his Democratic rivals, Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker.</p>
        <p>Asked if he could have put more money into the budget to cover raises for police officers if he were speaker, Mr. Ferrer answered that he would never have been speaker because he would never have run for the office. Asked why not, he replied, ''Because I want to be mayor.'' Thus far, no sitting leader of the modern City Council has won the mayoralty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's campaign spokesman, Reggie Johnson, shot back, ''Sadly, instead of standing with Gifford over the past four years as he has fought on behalf of civil employees, Mr. Ferrer has chosen the easier path of the misguided election-year attack.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Miller reserved his attention for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, saying that although the new random bag searches on the subway were necessary to protect against terror attacks, they were insufficient.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line,'' he said in a statement released by his campaign, ''is this is a reactive measure and should not be confused with a proactive, comprehensive approach to protecting straphangers.''</p>
