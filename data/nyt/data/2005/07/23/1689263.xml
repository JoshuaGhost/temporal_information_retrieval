        <p>The Pentagon announced Friday that Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, who has been in charge of efforts to train Iraqi security forces, has completed his yearlong tour of duty and will become commander of the Army Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.</p>
        <p>Named to replace him was Maj. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who also was nominated for promotion to lieutenant general, the Pentagon statement said.</p>
        <p>Senior Bush administration and Pentagon officials say the training of Iraqi security forces is critical to stabilizing the country and to supporting a political process that will allow the reduction of American forces in Iraq, perhaps as early as next year.</p>
        <p>It has been a daunting and complicated task. A newly declassified Pentagon assessment released to Congress said only ''a small number'' of Iraqi security forces can fight insurgents without American assistance, although about a third of the Iraqi Army is capable of ''planning, executing and sustaining counterinsurgency operations'' with support.</p>
        <p>About half of Iraq's new police battalions are still being established, the assessment said, and the rest of the police units and two-thirds of the new army battalions are only ''partially capable'' of carrying out counterinsurgency missions, and then only with American help.</p>
        <p>General Dempsey is commander of the First Armored Division, which spent a year securing Baghdad and subduing an uprising across south-central Iraq led by a radical Shiite cleric.</p>
        <p>In his new job, General Petraeus will be in charge of the Command and General Staff College, where the Army gives advanced training to its most promising officers.</p>
