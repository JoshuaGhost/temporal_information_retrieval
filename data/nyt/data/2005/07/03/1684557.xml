        <p>When Olivia Chantecaille founded the Chantecaille cosmetics company with her mother, Sylvie, in 1997, the two made it a priority that their products, which now include skin care and fragrances, be loaded with botanicals. ''My mom and I have a passion for flowers and plants,'' she said. Ms. Chantecaille's love for all things floral exceeds mere beauty products. ''I have a huge painting of a garden in my apartment; it's my little oasis in Manhattan,'' she said. ''And I always keep fresh flowers at work to counteract the negative energy of the computer and phone.'' Even her wardrobe is floral, especially in summer. Here she wears a suede, mirrored jacket from J. Mendel's spring collection over a Gap tank top; a cotton skirt by Behnaz Sarafpour (also bought this spring) and Sigerson Morrison sandals she has owned for five years and refers to as ''vintage.'' Her necklaces and bracelets are from H. Stern and Vera Wang. Ms. Chantecaille, a native New Yorker whose family is French, said that her favorite designers ''fuse the classic, feminine approach of Paris with American sportswear. Lars Nillson for Nina Ricci, Proenza Schouler and Derek Lam all have roots in structured elegance, but they add a modern spin.'' As a bonus, she said, ''they all make a lot of floral prints.''</p>
