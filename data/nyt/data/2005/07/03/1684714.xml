        <p>THE actors who perform regularly at Boscobel Restoration here must be tired of critics raving about the physical setting, but a Hudson River view this spectacular is hard to ignore. And the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival puts it to beautiful use in its current outdoor production of ''The Tempest.''</p>
        <p>The play, Shakespeare's last completed work, is set on a magical island, and Terrence O'Brien, the director, seems to draw in all of Boscobel's grounds as part of that island. At some points, one or two characters may be performing their lines in the open-air tent that is the stage while another actor stands, silent and still, far back in the distance, creating a sense of both portent and territory. The cast's group entrance is stunningly dramatic.</p>

        <p>THE actors who perform regularly at Boscobel Restoration here must be tired of critics raving about the physical setting, but a Hudson River view this spectacular is hard to ignore. And the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival puts it to beautiful use in its current outdoor production of ''The Tempest.''</p>
        <p>The play, Shakespeare's last completed work, is set on a magical island, and Terrence O'Brien, the director, seems to draw in all of Boscobel's grounds as part of that island. At some points, one or two characters may be performing their lines in the open-air tent that is the stage while another actor stands, silent and still, far back in the distance, creating a sense of both portent and territory. The cast's group entrance is stunningly dramatic.</p>
        <p>After a short musical number, thunder and lightning effects, and some group swaying to represent the shipwreck in the first scene, the major characters begin speaking up: Prospero (Stephen Paul Johnson), the rightful Duke of Milan who now rules only this island and its supernatural inhabitants; Ariel (Joey Parsons), the sprite who does his bidding; Caliban (Chris Edwards), his deformed slave; and Miranda (Erin Buckley), Prospero's daughter, who has been on this island since she was 3.</p>
        <p>Miranda will soon meet Ferdinand (Ryan Quinn), a shipwreck survivor, and fall in love at first sight. This is fairly predictable -- she doesn't remember ever having seen a man other than her father and Caliban.</p>
        <p>The delicately built Ms. Parsons plays Ariel effectively as an exotic bird, constantly twitching, with just a dash of the tortured Gollum from the ''Lord of the Rings'' movies. As Caliban, Mr. Edwards is appropriately brutish but eventually becomes a lovable slob, a bit like John Belushi's character in ''Animal House.'' Mr. Edwards wears a tattered top and shorts, and it is difficult to tell where his tattoos leave off and the monster makeup begins.</p>
        <p>Ms. Buckley and Mr. Quinn do fine jobs as the young lovers. As Stephano, the comically inebriated butler, Wesley Mann steals much of the show. It is easy to see why Caliban, having been introduced to the joys of drink by Stephano, decides to worship him.</p>
        <p>That leaves us with Prospero. Mr. Johnson, who has received admiring reviews in his seven previous seasons with the company, gives a somewhat puzzling performance. Theatergoers who do not know the story of ''The Tempest'' before might leave the theater with the impression that Prospero was a minor figure. In recent years, the character has been played with varying combinations of rage, majesty, nobility and playfulness. He has been called, alternately, world-weary, melancholy, conflicted and raw. But neither Mr. Johnson nor Mr. O'Brien has given this Prospero, who orders Ariel to work her magic but takes no pleasure in it, a notably strong emotion or attitude.</p>
        <p>Luckily the production has many other assets, including Sara Jean Tosetti's lovely costumes and Lisa Rinehart's happy, energetic choreography. The playwright's language is rather nice, too.</p>
        <p>''The Tempest'' is at Boscobel Restoration, 1601 Route 9D, Garrison, through Aug. 6. Information: (845)265-3638.</p>
