        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, has maintained repeatedly this season that he will recommend no blockbuster trades and make no drastic moves to shake his sedentary club like a snow globe.

        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, has maintained repeatedly this season that he will recommend no blockbuster trades and make no drastic moves to shake his sedentary club like a snow globe. First, there's his belief that the $200 million payroll should be adequate. And second, even if this aging club wanted more veterans, the Yankees have few marquee minor leaguers to trade.</p>
        <p>But Cashman's willingness to stay the course also derives from another source: his consultation of the statistics that are trickling quietly into baseball's front offices, helping general managers throughout the majors assess teams -- from the seemingly overachieving Washington Nationals to the disappointing Yankees -- as the season hits the midway mark.</p>
        <p>''Typically, it's pretty accurate,'' Cashman said of the data. ''It weeds out who is playing above their heads for a period of time, and who might be playing below their levels. Those type of measurements certainly come into play -- you have to look at it.''</p>
        <p>Baseball's statistics community has spent decades confirming that a team's won-lost record can be predicted by its aggregate runs scored and runs allowed. (Because the actual formula raises these figures to the power of 2, it is colloquially called the Pythagorean method.) Most important, these metrics -- as well as others that consider deeper statistics like home runs, walks and records in one-run games -- can give a truer picture of a team's talent and potential than a won-lost record.</p>
        <p>The best examples this season are the Nationals and the Chicago White Sox, who are flying far higher atop the standings than their performances would suggest. Although in first place at 47-31, Washington has been outscored this season by 324 runs to 322 -- soil from which a .500 record usually grows, and suggesting a withering summer could be imminent. Similarly, the 53-24 White Sox have won five more games than their 370-286 total score would indicate.</p>
        <p>(It should be noted that these ''extra'' victories are in the books and can't be taken away; it's just that they will probably not reoccur in the second half, diluting a team's final record.)</p>
        <p>But there is strong hope for teams like Cashman's Yankees. They have scored 414 runs and yielded 388, pointing to a 41-36 record that's two games better than the Yankees' actual one going into Friday night's game. But this projection game can go extra innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' run totals aren't quite what they have deserved, either. If you replace their real-life runs with ones that would result from raw statistics like home runs, stolen bases and so on (those calculations will be mercifully skipped here), the team emerges as more of a 43-34 club held down by several levels of bad luck.</p>
        <p>Baseball executives have also begun to consider how a team's record in one-run games can disguise its overall strength. Many studies over the past 25 years have demonstrated that teams excelling at one-run games over one period of time can struggle in the next. Therefore, a team with an uncharacteristic record in one-run games should expect something more normal in the future.</p>
        <p>This year's Padres, who are leading the National League West, should beware. They have a 43-36 record but have won 18 of 25 one-run games, something they will be hard pressed to repeat in the second half. Meanwhile, teams like the Toronto Blue Jays and the Florida Marlins, who are fluttering around .500 but have performed poorly in one-run games, may prove more dangerous than they appear.</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom holds that teams with strong closers and managers do better in one-run games. (For example, the Padres and the Nationals have thrived because San Diego's Trevor Hoffman and Washington's Chad Cordero have been outstanding.) But evidence suggests otherwise. As one of many illustrations, the Atlanta Braves won the N.L. East from 2002 through 2004 with the same closer, John Smoltz, and the same manager, Bobby Cox, while posting one-run records of 28-17, 17-25 and 27-17.</p>
        <p>Craig Wright, the in-house statistics analyst for the Texas Rangers from 1981 to 1985 (some teams had numbers people even earlier), discovered that the records of teams in games decided by two runs or more was considerably more significant in predicting performance.</p>
        <p>''If I were a manager, I would hate to think someone was trying to evaluate the job I'm doing based on my team's record in one-run games,'' Wright wrote in an e-mail message. ''They are pretty much anybody's game.''</p>
        <p>It must have seemed that way to Cashman and the Yankees last Tuesday night, when their late 4-3 lead over the Orioles turned into a 5-4 loss, the game ending on a home run by Brian Roberts off the left-hander Mike Stanton. Cashman's rational side said that he needed to pan back from such losses, however painful, and realize that they were often less significant at a distance. But even a stat-savvy general manager has limits.</p>
        <p>''It's easy for me to use the statistics as backup and say we are better than our record shows,'' Cashman said. ''But that doesn't eliminate some of the obvious problems that this club has revealed.''</p>
        <p>Sure enough, Stanton's pitch to Roberts became his last as a Yankee; Cashman designated him for assignment two days later. Projections go only so far, and certainly less far than that homer Stanton coughed up. Like the ball Roberts hit deep into the Baltimore night, that potential Yankee victory will never come back.</p>
