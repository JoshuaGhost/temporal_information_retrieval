        <p>For a brief moment Thursday, Jack Nicklaus was on the leader board at the 134th British Open.</p>
        <p>A birdie at the opening hole -- with a 3-wood, a 7-iron and a 7-foot putt -- brought him to one-under par at the Old Course, lifting his name on the scoreboard.</p>

        <p>For a brief moment Thursday, Jack Nicklaus was on the leader board at the 134th British Open.</p>
        <p>A birdie at the opening hole -- with a 3-wood, a 7-iron and a 7-foot putt -- brought him to one-under par at the Old Course, lifting his name on the scoreboard.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Well, that's a great start,''' Nicklaus said. ''But then I started three-putting.''</p>
        <p>The 65-year-old Nicklaus, in what he has said will be his final appearance in a major tournament, opened with a three-over-par 75 to stand nine shots out of the lead and in danger of missing the cut.</p>
        <p>Nicklaus was tied for 98th place. The top 70 players and ties through 36 holes will make the cut.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to walk across the bridge on Sunday,'' he said of the Swilcan Bridge at the 18th hole. ''That's really my goal. I'm a little disappointed in 75, obviously, and that means I have to shoot a pretty low round tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Nicklaus was paired with Tom Watson (75), one of his greatest rivals, and Luke Donald (68), one of England's best hopes to win the Claret Jug.</p>
        <p>At the British Open in 1977 at Turnberry, Nicklaus and Watson staged one of the game's most memorable duels, and Watson beat Nicklaus by one stroke.</p>
        <p>Watson, a five-time British Open champion, also birdied the first hole Thursday.</p>
        <p>''Tom, obviously very popular over here, got a nice response,'' Nicklaus said. ''We all did. It was a very nice day. Unfortunately, for Tom and myself, neither one of us did what we wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Watson said, ''It was disappointing from that standpoint.'' Then, of Nicklaus, he added: ''The warmth and love the crowds over here in Scotland gave him was a wonderful example of how much they respect the man. I concur with that.''</p>
        <p>Hensby Makes Appearance</p>
        <p>Mark Hensby of Australia, who shot a five-under-par 67 Thursday, won the John Deere Classic last year to qualify for the British Open at Troon but skipped it when he ran into travel difficulties.</p>
        <p>''I don't know anyone in the White House,'' Hensby said. ''I didn't have my passport at the time. I was trying my best to get here, but it never turned out. There's definitely no lack of desire to play in a major.''</p>
        <p>Just Another Tournament</p>
        <p>Todd Hamilton, who opened with a two-over-par 74, said he did not feel added pressure at St. Andrews after winning the British Open last year and had not changed his approach.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the bookies didn't either,'' Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Hamilton was listed at 250-to-1 in some British gambling houses. This year?</p>
        <p>''I was 200-to-1, I think,'' Hamilton said. ''I just look at it as another golf tournament. It's not, but that is how you have to look at it, otherwise you just get very tense. Everything gets magnified in these tournaments, all the bad bounces.''</p>
