        <p>IN THE SHADOWS OF HISTORY: Fifty Years Behind the Scenes of Cold War Diplomacy. By Chester L. Cooper. (Prometheus, $28.) The unmasking of W. Mark Felt as Deep Throat is a reminder of the power of a No. 2: he wasn't the boss, but he was twice as dangerous. Cooper's political memoir opens with the claim that in his long career as a senior officer in the C.I.A. and various other federal agencies -- ''as deputy or special assistant to, of or for somebody or something'' -- he has had a wisdom far beyond that of his high-powered but short-term bosses. A promising hypothesis, but what Cooper's experience shows -- from minor O.S.S. operations in China during World War II through Korea, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam and other conflicts -- is that bureaucratic work, even all the way (or almost all the way) to the top, is always dull and usually inconsequential. During the Suez crisis of 1956, as the British-French-Israeli plan to recover the canal from Egypt builds to a dangerous standoff, our hero wrings his hands for a while and then plays Monopoly with his family; in 1966 he rubber-stamps an empty promise from President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw troops from Vietnam within six months. Cooper describes every diplomatic tea party and handshake in fetishistic detail, but his role is never clear, nor are any of those vital lessons from history. Sometimes a fly on the wall is just a fly.</p>
        <p>THE LAST VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS: Being the Epic Tale of the Great Captain's Fourth Expedition, Including Accounts of Swordfight, Mutiny, Shipwreck, Gold, War, Hurricane, and Discovery. By Martin Dugard. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) Vast new lands, strange new peoples, Edenic flora and fauna aside, Columbus's four voyages to the new world were commercial enterprises, with a nervous Spanish court expecting a return on its investment. In a rich, fluent account, Dugard offers both a gripping naval adventure and a revealing history of the competitive mercantile politics of the turn of the 16th century, and portrays Columbus as a star-crossed striver eager to legitimize his quest. Reined in by hard-nosed administrators and for a time imprisoned for failing to maintain order in the critical outpost of Santo Domingo, the Admiral of the Ocean Sea made a final, desperate attempt in 1502 to find that elusive passage to India. Perhaps he knew it was doomed when, while searching for gold in the lush Panamanian jungle, a scout was told by angry inhabitants that ''these people were going to burn our ships and kill us all,'' a threat they nearly carried out. The leaking fleet escaped, only to be marooned in Jamaica for a year. But Columbus's ingenuity never failed him. In an archetypal high-seas scam, when the local tribe in Jamaica began to cut off the castaways' food supply, he consulted an astronomy text and told the Indians ''God would send them a clear token from heaven of the punishment they were about to receive'' if they didn't cough up the daily victuals; right on schedule a lunar eclipse came, the Indians cried for mercy, and that was that. Dugard's detailed reconstructions, while sometimes far-fetched (how could he know that Columbus's prison shackles were ''clattering lightly'' as he wrote an apology to Ferdinand and Isabella?), rely on ships' logs, journals, letters and other contemporary accounts, letting the participants describe these extraordinary adventures themselves.</p>

        <p>ICON. Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business. By Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon. (Wiley, $24.95.) Are exaggeration and hyperbole necessities of big business, or just big-business biographies? To spice up Steve Jobs's familiar trajectory (co-founder of Apple Computer at 21, forced out at 30, he regained his crown and made a bundle in the digital music market) Young and Simon resort to an overheated, dubious pitch. Jobs is not just a smart and lucky businessman, he is ''an all-around mythic American figure'' whose every product demonstration is ''an absolutely incredible performance.'' Jobs is a master hype man, to be sure -- he sold $25,000 worth of Apple's first product before it was even built. But while the authors hint at tragic character flaws -- solitary and self-absorbed as a child, he long denied paternity of his first daughter, and in one conference-room episode he exploded with anger when another executive usurped his precious dry-erase board -- the second half of the book is a guileless hagiography, with little insight into the recent workings of the company and no skepticism about, say, its reliance on the fickle consumer music business. Strange, then, that before ''iCon'' was published Jobs banned all the publisher's titles from Apple's retail stores. Perhaps he was frightened by the ambiguous title, which, though never explained, suggests that Jobs may be the perpetrator of a great business ''con.'' But in falling for a prodigal-son myth and hyping the Apple ''revolution,'' it was the authors who got snookered.</p>
        <p>MEDICI MONEY: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence. By Tim Parks. (Atlas/Norton, $22.95.) The Renaissance may have been the beginning of modern history, but to the Medici bankers of the 15th century, as Parks argues in a swift and brilliant synthesis of finance, politics and history, it must have felt like an aftermath. The plague had killed a third of Europe, and in Italy the feudal system had broken down, forcing vulnerable city-states into open conflict. And all that labyrinthine medieval theology wasn't good for business. Usury was a ''detestable sin'' (Dante put moneylenders with sodomites in the third ring of the seventh circle of hell), but since the church had a need for letters of credit to transfer the tribute flowing in from all over Europe, and since many priests knew firsthand the benefits of discretionary (savings) accounts that paid gifts (interest), elaborate loopholes were devised to permit it. Parks's deft primer on the Medici, from the founding of the bank in 1397 to its collapse 97 years later -- a Gibbonesque decline in miniature -- mingles the family's political, financial and aristocratic ambitions. (The subtitle is inapt: though patronage of art and the ''metaphysics'' of wiggling around church doctrine were always a part of Medici life, Parks's real subjects are money and politics.) As its empire spread throughout Europe, the family increased its manipulation of Florence's hopelessly corrupt government and married its most famous son, Lorenzo il Magnifico, into nobility. Turns out Lorenzo had more interest in writing poetry than in running a bank, so one by one the branches shut down, unable to collect on huge loans to the church and various heads of state, ''people who actually feel it is undignified to repay.'' When the family was expelled from Florence, the only thing that saved it was a pope: Leo X, Lorenzo's son Giovanni, maintained the fortune and supported the family's return. Not so modern after all.</p>
        <p>NASTY: My Family and Other Glamorous Varmints. By Simon Doonan. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24.) To hear Doonan tell his story, it's a wonder not everyone raised in mid-century Reading, England, turned out to be as foppish and superficial as he did. In a memoir of style consciousness and gay life never quite as witty as it pretends to be, Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, describes in exorbitant detail his lifelong scheme to escape the ''life of low expectations'' in his gray industrial hometown and to find ''the Beautiful People'' -- those ''effortlessly stylish trendsetters'' in the pages of magazines -- wherever they may be. So off to a squalid glam-era London flat decorated with little more than a gigantic floor pillow; David Bowie was not found, but Rita, a prostitute who each night performed a ''horrifying, apocalyptic Wagnerian symphony of noises'' through the thin walls, was all too available. At some unaccounted point Doonan drops his quest for the Beautiful People in favor of an all too tidy and disingenuous embrace of the quirks of humanity, embodied by his proudly unglamorous mother. Her foibles -- her loose dentures and so-out-it's-in World War II-era hairdo -- and therefore his, are more than once praised as life-enhancing. But behind this shallow thumbs-up lies a vulnerable self-image that Doonan fails to explore: ''It is your duty,'' goes his mother's philosophy, as he sees it, ''not to inflict your innate troll-like appearance upon the people around you and to do everything in your power to camouflage it.'' Doesn't sound so life-enhancing, does it</p>
