        <p>Neall Epstein, 27, a biochemist and snowboard guide from Vancouver, British Columbia. "I was at a surf camp in Taghazout, but the waves were very small, and Grilo, the guy sitting behind me on the camel, said 'I know this really cool area. We'll have to take camels, and not everyone's allowed to go there because it's where the king's summer palace is. Don't worry though, because I know the head security guard.' These guys we met loaded up their camels. For some reason ours was the only one that didn't want surfboards. At the beach, two guards came out with guns and started asking questions. Grilo said, 'I know your boss and I've spoken with him many times before. You can either go find him, waste his time and he'll tell us its o.k., or you can go and have lunch.' They went and had lunch. It was one of the best days of surfing we had.''</p>
