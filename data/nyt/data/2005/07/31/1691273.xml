        <p>Mark Batson is a busy man. A long-established jazz and R&amp;B keyboardist, Mr. Batson has become ubiquitous as a producer. Since producing, performing on and co-writing songs for the R&amp;B singer India.Arie's debut album, ''Acoustic Soul,'' in 2001, he has had a hand -- more often two -- in creating music by a variety of artists, including Seal, Gwen Stefani, 50 Cent and the Game. Most recently he collaborated with the Dave Matthews Band on the album "Stand Up" (RCA). Mr. Batson spoke with Joel Topcik last week between studio sessions with the hip-hop producer Dr. Dre:</p>
        <p>k-os</p>
        <p>''Joyful Rebellion'' (Astralwerks), from the Canadian rapper k-os (pronounced like ''chaos''), is the most adventurous hip-hop album I've heard. The use of live instruments and the production are what really make it work. At its root, it's still a hip-hop album, but with the live drums, the acoustic and electric guitars, the string arrangements, it's much more than that in the same way OutKast's last record was. The lead track, ''Emcee Murdah,'' and ''B-Boy Stance'' especially grabbed me.</p>
        <p>The White Stripes</p>
        <p>I've got one or two of the White Stripes' earlier records, but ''Get Behind Me, Satan'' (V2) really caught me. I like Jack White's switch from guitar to piano. The raw piano-and-drum combination sounds like they set up mikes in a room and just played. I like to hear people on records, and you can get that sometimes when someone isn't necessarily a virtuoso player. I wouldn't say Jack White is an accomplished pianist, but the sound has a great feel, like the piano on old Tom Waits records.</p>
        <p>Common</p>
        <p>There's a beautiful thing happening in hip-hop these days where an artist will get with a producer and they'll make an album. Sounds simple, but a lot of hip-hop records have so many producers, and different producers on different tracks, that it's hard to get a unified feel. On ''Be'' (Geffen), which came out in May, Kanye West stepped up and made a real album for Common. I listen to it all the way through, which I rarely do with a hip-hop album. I might have added a little arrangement, along the lines of k-os's album, but I like the way Kanye crafted enough space for Common's energy to come through.</p>
        <p>Foxy Brown</p>
        <p>''Come Fly With Me'' is the new single from Foxy Brown's upcoming album, ''Black Roses'' (Def Jam), which comes out next month. She really jumped into two pots for this one, mixing up her rap thing with Jamaican patois. Foxy has crazy skills, and she's a real lyricist who plays with words. On ''Come Fly With Me,'' she's rhyming Jamaican expressions, mixing them into her raps, and using really intricate rhythms. I don't think anyone has ever done that before, and if they have, they didn't do it this well. The beat has a Caribbean element, but it's a hip-hop song at heart. And with the dancehall singer Sizzla on the chorus, forget about it -- the energy and emotion really come through. I've been playing it every day.</p>
        <p>Amerie</p>
        <p>Amerie is an artist who's bringing energy back to R&amp;B. It used to be you would listen to R&amp;B records by groups like Earth, Wind and Fire or Sly and the Family Stone, and you just couldn't wait to hear the songs live, they had so much energy. Now a lot of records sound too smooth. It's hard, as a producer, to capture that balance between the production and letting the emotion come through. Hip-hop has been finding that balance in the last five or so years; R&amp;B is starting to catch up. The producer Rich Harrison found it for Amerie's single ''1 Thing'' (Sony Urban). He uses a Meters sample in the song, and I'm a die-hard Meters fan.</p>
        <p>Sweet Honey in the Rock</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago I went to see the documentary ''Raise Your Voice,'' which follows the all-female a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock on its 30th anniversary tour in 2003. The DVD has interviews and great performances of those important freedom songs that give you a feel for the history of the music and the civil rights era. Bernice Johnson Reagon, the group's founder, is probably one of the last living warriors, like Paul Robeson -- someone who sang and got people to listen long enough to stop fighting. The emotion she has been able to express with her voice, and then put into a group arrangement, is a whole other level of artistry. She's more than just a voice, a singer of songs; she's a defender of people.</p>
        <p>50 Cent</p>
        <p>I've worked with 50 Cent before, but I didn't get a chance to work with him the way I wanted. I'm a big fan of the folk-blues singer Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter), and that's how I think of 50 Cent -- as a blues singer. Songs like ''Ski Mask Way'' on his recent album ''The Massacre'' (Shady Records/Aftermath) are like money hymns: they capture the drama and the emotion of wanting to be paid. That's the American dream. There are a lot of great songs on ''The Massacre,'' ones that will last for a while. But there are too many songs on the record, and the sequencing isn't great, so it doesn't make a complete statement. When I listen to it, I use my own sequence and add other 50 Cent songs like ''I Run New York,'' with Tony Yayo, and ''The Way We Came Up.''</p>
