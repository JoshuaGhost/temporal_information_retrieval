        <p>ABOUT two years ago, the people at the Popcorn Park Zoo in Forked River were still trying to wrap their heads around what had happened at their little oasis one night that May. Three teenagers had broken into the zoo, which takes in abused and unwanted animals, and wreaked the very kind of terror that the creatures had come there to escape. Eight birds, emus and rheas among them, were killed.</p>
        <p>The attacks drew widespread notice, and so did the aftermath -- probation for all three young men, sentences that left many animal lovers fuming. It's a common pattern involving cruelty to animals: grotesque crime, not-quite-adequate punishment. But lately, some people are trying to break that cycle.</p>

        <p>ABOUT two years ago, the people at the Popcorn Park Zoo in Forked River were still trying to wrap their heads around what had happened at their little oasis one night that May. Three teenagers had broken into the zoo, which takes in abused and unwanted animals, and wreaked the very kind of terror that the creatures had come there to escape. Eight birds, emus and rheas among them, were killed.</p>
        <p>The attacks drew widespread notice, and so did the aftermath -- probation for all three young men, sentences that left many animal lovers fuming. It's a common pattern involving cruelty to animals: grotesque crime, not-quite-adequate punishment. But lately, some people are trying to break that cycle.</p>
        <p>''Somehow humane treatment just needs to be instilled at a younger age,'' said Assemblyman Douglas H. Fisher, a Cumberland County Democrat.</p>
        <p>That's why he recently introduced a bill that would require public schools to provide instruction about the humane treatment of animals as part of the core curriculum. (Stephen M. Sweeney has introduced the same bill in the Senate.) The measure, aimed at kindergarten through eighth grade, is nothing fancy. ''It just says that there needs to be in the curriculum an opportunity to talk about compassion,'' Mr. Fisher said.</p>
        <p>Roseann Trezza, executive director of the Associated Humane Societies, which runs the Popcorn Park Zoo and four animal shelters in the state, sees evidence of the need for humane education with dismaying regularity. Many of the calls come at this time of year, when wild animals creep out of the woodwork with their young: two baby raccoons with their eyes and mouths stapled shut; a groundhog set on fire; a crowd trying to stone a perplexed baby raccoon to death.</p>
        <p>''It was youths and adults, and they were all laughing,'' Ms. Trezza said of the last incident. ''These animals don't know enough to run away.''</p>
        <p>The whole subject overwhelms Ms. Trezza; her stories come out in fragments. ''I am speechless when I try to talk about this,'' she said. ''The things that you never thought a child could do to an animal. You just don't know where all the anger comes from.''</p>
        <p>She said she would like to see an hour's instruction a week, though she wonders if humane education in lower grades is undone by animal dissections in upper grades (a practice addressed in another piece of pending legislation). Although treating animals humanely may seem obvious, apparently in some households the reigning philosophy is indifference at best, outright cruelty at worst.</p>
        <p>''I don't see a common denominator except that it starts in the home, when they're kids,'' Ms. Trezza said. ''Young kids. Teach them gentleness.''</p>
        <p>At Popcorn Park on a recent Friday, the nightmare of two years ago was being banished by a swirl of activity. Children were tumbling out of buses and minivans to visit the animals and absorb their stories. Those stories range from relatively benign (a donkey that had been someone's 4-H project until that someone went off to college) to frightening (a goat tied up on a Newark rooftop, possibly to become a cult sacrifice).</p>
        <p>Among the newest additions to the menagerie are, incongruously for New Jersey, three bears from Ohio. The Garden State, of course, has plenty of bears of its own, but these three are too domesticated for release in the wild.</p>
        <p>John Bergmann, the director of the zoo, said they were owned by a breeder who apparently lent them out for photo shoots and such when they were cubs but couldn't handle them once they grew older. The sign on the fence of their new home says they kept escaping from their pen in the town of Xenia, alarming parents of children in a day care center.</p>
        <p>Had Popcorn Park not taken the bears, Mr. Bergmann said, ''there's a good possibility that their gallbladders were going overseas'' for black-market medicinal use.</p>
        <p>Maybe the gesture of saving a few animals is futile. Maybe the proposal for humane education is, too. Perhaps cruelty can't be cured and teachers don't need another mandate loaded onto their backs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fisher says it's worth a try. ''I'm mindful of the fact that we can't say, every time someone has an initiative, that we need it to be part of the curriculum,'' he said. ''But this has universal appeal.''</p>
        <p>And perhaps it's not really about bears and emus at all. The ''animal'' a human being is most likely to abuse is another human being. Teach compassion toward all creatures and maybe, some day, the headlines about what we're doing to ourselves will become less gruesome.</p>
