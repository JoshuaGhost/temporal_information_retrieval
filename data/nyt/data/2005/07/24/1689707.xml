        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>David Toms disqualified himself from the British Open because he thought he might have hit a ball in motion, thereby incurring a penalty that was not on his scorecard. No one but Toms saw the possible infraction of the rules during the opening round. By his action, Toms forfeited any chance for a big paycheck and the attendant prestige should he have won.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>David Toms disqualified himself from the British Open because he thought he might have hit a ball in motion, thereby incurring a penalty that was not on his scorecard. No one but Toms saw the possible infraction of the rules during the opening round. By his action, Toms forfeited any chance for a big paycheck and the attendant prestige should he have won.</p>
        <p>Now look at so many other professional athletes. There are reports of performance enhancers, illegal equipment modifications and a general disregard for the rules if the athletes can get away with it. They claim a catch or an out or a goal when the opposite may be true, and leave it to others to sort it out.</p>
        <p>Violations that incur league suspensions bring about a hue and cry from the perpetrators as being too severe. Now add to this the huge contracts for nonperformers and contrast this to golfers, who must earn their money every week without guarantee, and the picture is complete.</p>
        <p>It seems honesty in sports is relegated to a precious few.</p>
