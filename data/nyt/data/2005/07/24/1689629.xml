        <p>No Shakin' Goin' On</p>
        <p>Q. What is that steel-girder platform attached to the west pier of the Brooklyn Bridge? Is it permanent? And what was that barge doing tied up near the pier?</p>
        <p>A. They were there for earthquake protection.</p>
        <p>Don't be alarmed: No earthquakes have damaged the bridge or its approaches. But the bridge, which is to undergo a major rehabilitation of ramps and approaches in a few years, is considered a ''critical structure'' under state and federal law and is required to have a seismic evaluation as part of the renovating, said Kay Sarlin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department. Results of the seismic study, which has already been performed on the Brooklyn tower, will determine whether the bridge needs extra work to make it earthquake-resistant. The work has been going on since March 2004.</p>

        <p>Q. What is that steel-girder platform attached to the west pier of the Brooklyn Bridge? Is it permanent? And what was that barge doing tied up near the pier?</p>
        <p>A. They were there for earthquake protection.</p>
        <p>Don't be alarmed: No earthquakes have damaged the bridge or its approaches. But the bridge, which is to undergo a major rehabilitation of ramps and approaches in a few years, is considered a ''critical structure'' under state and federal law and is required to have a seismic evaluation as part of the renovating, said Kay Sarlin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department. Results of the seismic study, which has already been performed on the Brooklyn tower, will determine whether the bridge needs extra work to make it earthquake-resistant. The work has been going on since March 2004.</p>
        <p>''We will be doing seismic retrofitting on all East River bridges and the Harlem River bridges and some bridges on the Belt Parkway as well as other locations that are considered critical evacuation routes,'' Ms. Sarlin said. This retrofitting, she said, was part of a general evaluation of critical structures across the country and was not related to 9/11.</p>
        <p>The platform, which is not there now, was erected temporarily to aid drilling operations to test the remaining strength of materials in the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
        <p>The barge at the Manhattan tower was used by Warren George Inc., a subcontractor of the Transportation Department, to drill into the caisson and the rock around the tower as part of the seismic study. This was the first time anyone had drilled into the actual caisson that was sunk in the East River in the 1870's under the direction of John and Washington Roebling. The drilling began in January and has been completed, and no cracks or slippage as a result of earthquakes was found, Ms. Sarlin said.</p>
        <p>The City on Long Island</p>
        <p>Q. How did Long Island City get its name? Seems odd to have a city within a city.</p>
        <p>A. Think of small villages yearning to move up in rank. Before the five boroughs were consolidated as New York City in 1898, there was a smaller consolidation by the Queens villages of Hunters Point, Astoria, Ravenswood and Dutch Kills. They, or parts of them, incorporated as a new political entity, Long Island City, in 1870. They had formerly been part of the town of Newtown, which had been set up in 1789 to govern rural hamlets. Its headquarters were fairly far away in present-day Elmhurst and it was run by a corrupt municipal government.</p>
        <p>''The contrast between busy up-to-date Long Island City with its many buildings, sizable population, crowded ferries, extensive industry and street railways and sleepy, backward Newtown was ludicrous,'' Vincent F. Seyfried wrote in ''300 Years of Long Island City.'' From 1870 to 1898 Long Island City had its own mayor and government, as did the towns of Newtown, Jamaica and Flushing.</p>
