      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Kurmanbek S. Bakiyev, a former opposition leader who had become interim president of Kyrgyzstan, was declared Monday to be the winner of the presidential election by a landslide, capturing nearly 90 percent of the ballots cast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakiyev's overwhelming victory marked a consolidation of the revolution this spring that forced out the former president, Askar Akayev, and gave the interim president the mandate he sought to begin work on Kyrgyzstan's abundant problems.</p>
        <p>With more than 99 percent of the votes counted in the six-way race, Mr. Bakiyev had 88.7 percent of the vote, the Kyrgyzstan election commission reported. His closest competitor received less than 4 percent.</p>
        <p>''It was a persuasive victory of our people,'' he said at a news conference. ''The trust that people displayed in us is high, and obliges us to do many things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakiyev faces pressing concerns, both domestically and abroad.</p>
        <p>The most pressing is the fate of more than 400 Uzbek refugees who fled to Kyrgyz soil after surviving a bloody crackdown in May following a prison break and antigovernment demonstrations in Andijon, Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan has been pressing to have 131 of the refugees returned. Western governments and human rights organizations warn that would violate international conventions and endanger the refugees.</p>
        <p>As interim president, Mr. Bakiyev equivocated on the question of the refugees' fate. He is under intense pressure from Uzbekistan, upon which Kyrgyzstan depends in part for fuel and trade.</p>
        <p>What is at stake, said Jerzy Skuratowicz, the United Nations resident coordinator here, is the reputation of the country in the opening moments of a new presidency. ''The way that Kyrgyzstan will deal with the refugees will basically be part of the image that will make the world understand whether Kyrgyzstan is one of the countries that will do what it says, and whether it is a country that will live within the rule of law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakiyev must also make a decision about a United States military base at the airport outside the capital. The base supports the Pentagon's operations in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Last week the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an alliance of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, demanded that the United States set a date for the withdrawal of its military from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakiyev also avoided providing a direct answer about this issue, indicating only that he supported the alliance's position and saying it was possible to discuss a timetable for withdrawal, suggesting a degree of flexibility.</p>
        <p>Domestically, Mr. Bakiyev faces a slate of post-Soviet problems, including economic malaise, soaring unemployment, systemic corruption, near universal poverty and decaying infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz have left the country in search of work, and its population is becoming younger and in need of new jobs.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bakiyev said people would have patience as he began his five-year term, because they ''see that the problems emerged not yesterday and not three months ago.''</p>
        <p>His position is not enviable. As he seeks to invigorate the economy and attract investment, Mr. Bakiyev will work with a Parliament that came to office this spring in tainted elections, and in which people have little faith. Two-thirds of those surveyed in a pre-election poll of 1,000 citizens by InterMedia, a Washington-based research firm, said they wanted new parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>Although election observers from local and international organizations noted that the conduct of the election on Sunday was an improvement over the parliamentary elections, it was not without considerable flaws.</p>
        <p>The observers said progress had been most evident in allowing free expression and assembly during the campaign, and in sharply reducing vote-buying, which had been widespread in parliamentary elections. But there were signs of vote-count manipulation and ballot stuffing.</p>
        <p>Kimmo Kiljunen of Finland, head of the observer delegation from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said a particular concern was the trimming of voter lists. A presidential election is not valid unless 50 percent of registered voters cast ballots. The official turnout announced by the Central Election Commission was 74.7 percent, a figure so high that Mr. Kiljunen called it ''implausible.''</p>
        <p>Observers said election officials at polling places reduced the registration lists before and during election day in an effort to make it easier to reach the 50-percent threshold. Such conduct would raise questions about the integrity of the political culture that Mr. Bakiyev has inherited.</p>
