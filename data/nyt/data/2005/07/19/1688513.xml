        <p>When Schumann claimed he was taking musical dictation from Schubert, his aural experience was creative and novel (''Brain Becomes an iPod'').

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When Schumann claimed he was taking musical dictation from Schubert, his aural experience was creative and novel (''Brain Becomes an iPod''). When Aunt Sadie hears the Andrews Sisters' tune from her high school prom over and over again, her experience is a simple repetition, more or less accurate, given the quality of her musical ear and memory.</p>
        <p>Are these experiences not radically different? The difference between minds that are tape loops and creative minds (in the case of Schumann, creative genius) does not seem to have interested any experimenters involved in this phenomenon. What a pity!</p>
