        <p>America  James Cohan  533 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through Sept. 24</p>
        <p>Now in spanking new 16-by-20-inch black-and-white prints, the cool and wry photographs of life in the American suburbs that Bill Owens made in the late 1960's and 70's still beguile. It may seem odd that the Vietnam War, domestic protest against the war and other sorts of countercultural ferment of the period should be so far away from Mr. Owens's viewfinder, but that is partly what makes his pictures so riveting.</p>

        <p>America  James Cohan  533 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through Sept. 24</p>
        <p>Now in spanking new 16-by-20-inch black-and-white prints, the cool and wry photographs of life in the American suburbs that Bill Owens made in the late 1960's and 70's still beguile. It may seem odd that the Vietnam War, domestic protest against the war and other sorts of countercultural ferment of the period should be so far away from Mr. Owens's viewfinder, but that is partly what makes his pictures so riveting.</p>
        <p>His photographs bypass the topical to explore the strange lives of white people in a peaceful never-never land of tract houses. Framed by perfect compositions and studied with what seems like a kindly extraterrestrial curiosity, Mr. Owens's suburbanites appear as vividly peculiar as they are normal: the serious boy with the buzz-cut hair and a toy rifle on a plastic Big Wheel; the teenage leaf rakers, one up in a small tree to remove the last leaves at his father's behest; the two couples stiffly dancing in an airlessly neat living room; the whole neighborhood gathered for a block party. These and other subjects are defamiliarized, but so tactfully that viewers of a certain background may still feel that they know them with heart-squeezing intimacy. Surely Steven Spielberg and Gregory Crewdson have learned much from Mr. Owens.</p>
        <p>But something is lost in Mr. Owens's larger color pictures from the 80's, like the one of a pretty girl sniffing cocaine in a nightclub bathroom. Because they reiterate a kind of knowledge made familiar by magazines, tabloids and movies, they lack the feeling of poetic discovery that animates the earlier pictures.</p>
