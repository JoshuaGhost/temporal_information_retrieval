        <p>Arts, Briefly column; CBS, for second consecutive night, wins overnight Nielsen ratings (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For the second night in a row, CBS won both in total viewers and among 18-to-49-year-olds in Nielsen's estimates. Its Tuesday night military crime show, ''NCIS,'' continued to do well in summer repeats, drawing 8.73 million viewers. Following that, ''Big Brother'' brought in a slightly smaller audience (8.37 million), but scored higher than ''NCIS'' in the 18-to-49 demographic. Those strong numbers bolstered the languid ''Rock Star: INXS'' at 10 p.m. The episode of ''Rock Star,'' in which the contestants performed, was No. 2 in its hour with 6.28 million viewers, but it took first place among adults 18 to 49. Its main competition was NBC's ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' rerun (7.56 million), which lifted NBC into second place for the night in households. Also at 10 p.m., the ABC miniseries ''Empire'' came to a conclusion, but only 4.33 million viewers know what that conclusion was.</p>
