        <p>The homeless man arrested last week on charges of stabbing a White Plains woman to death near a busy mall told the police that he had waited for hours in a stairwell for a white victim, the Westchester County district attorney's office said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>On the day the victim was buried, prosecutors played a 55-minute videotaped confession at a hearing for the defendant, Phillip Grant, who appeared before a White Plains City Court judge, Eric Press. On the tape, Mr. Grant, who is black, told his interrogator that ''the first person I see in this mall that looks white, I'm killing.''</p>
        <p>In the confession, a police officer asked Mr. Grant on the tape if he had ever seen the victim before. He replied: ''No, and I didn't care. As long as she had blond hair and blue eyes, she was going to die.'' The victim, Concetta Russo-Carriero, 56, had blond hair.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant, who refers in the tape to a ''race war,'' also said he had waited in the stairwell of a parking garage for several hours to find his victim, according to the district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro added that Mr. Grant said on the tape that he planned to kill other white people if they came to the aid of Ms. Russo-Carriero. Instead, he left the scene, but the police picked him up nearby moments after the attack, which occurred at 1 p.m. last Wednesday. ''He had no remorse and he was hoping to kill even more people,'' Ms. Pirro said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Russo-Carriero was discovered bleeding and unconscious on the top floor of the municipal parking garage next to the popular Galleria mall. She was a receptionist at a law firm not far from the garage, where she had a monthly parking permit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant was charged on Thursday with second-degree murder. Ms. Pirro said the case would now go to a grand jury, which will decide whether to indict Mr. Grant.</p>
        <p>Because of Mr. Grant's comments, Ms. Pirro said she would present the case as a hate crime. If he is convicted, the punishment would then increase to a minimum of 20 years to life from 15 years to life.</p>
        <p>The slaying of Ms. Russo-Carriero unnerved residents and workers in this relatively safe city, which has undergone a building boom in the past few years, with sleek new apartment towers, shops and restaurants downtown.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the arrest of Mr. Grant, a convicted rapist, elected officials began calling for passage of a civil commitment law that would allow the indefinite confinement of violent sexual predators.</p>
        <p>Such laws are now in place in more than a dozen states, including New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant, 43, who served almost 24 years in prison after his conviction in 1980, is classified as a Level 3 sex offender, considered the most dangerous.</p>
        <p>For the past two years, he has stayed at a shelter and a drop-in center for the homeless that are run by Westchester County at the county airport. County officials say there are a handful of Level 3 sex offenders at the shelter. The police said the attack on Ms. Russo-Carriero did not appear to involve any kind of sexual assault.</p>
        <p>The killing galvanized opponents of a new, larger homeless shelter the county hopes to open on county property known as the Grasslands Reservation, in Valhalla. It would replace the shelter at the airport, which the county plans to close at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The Grasslands Reservation also houses the county jail, Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College, among other institutions.</p>
        <p>In recent months, critics of the planned shelter have organized to oppose it, arguing that the county would be moving sex offenders who are among the homeless to an area with many more homes and schools.</p>
        <p>The Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, has asked state officials for permission to turn violent sex offenders away from county homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of mourners attended Ms. Russo-Carriero's funeral on Tuesday. Relatives, friends and colleagues filled St. Anthony's of Padua Church in West Harrison, remembering the victim's warmth and her devotion to her husband, John, and her two grown sons, Jonathan and Michael.</p>
