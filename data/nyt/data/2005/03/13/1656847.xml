      <block class="full_text">
        <p>She was the rebellious, incorrigible one in the Floyd family. Adopted at age 6, a mother at 14, pregnant again and a runaway at 16. That was Shanta.</p>
        <p>Even now, Cliff Floyd of the Mets treads lightly around his sister. In the off-season, the Floyds live together in Sunrise, Fla.: Cliff; his parents, Cornelius and Olivia; and Shanta and her son, Jaylen, 6, and daughter, Shariyah, 2. With the Mets well into spring training, Cliff is not around much, which makes what is happening with Shanta these days so hard for him to take.</p>
        <p>Shanta developed breast cancer two years ago at age 18, and she now faces another fight for her life. Two months ago, Shanta developed severe headaches, and a biopsy revealed cancer in her brain. She has begun radiation and steroid treatments, and though Olivia Floyd remains hopeful, Cliff is prepared for what may come.</p>
        <p>''It's tough,'' he said this week in the Mets' clubhouse. ''I can't imagine what she's going through, and I don't have the words to say to her. I say, 'How you doing?' If I don't have the right words, she'd probably curse me out.''</p>
        <p>The old Shanta might have. That is the thing Olivia Floyd grabs onto in all this, the transformation of her daughter from rebel to, in Olivia's words, ''a sweetie.'' Amid the sadness, Olivia has found a certain amount of comfort. And that, Cliff Floyd said, is the thing keeping his family together.</p>
        <p>''My mom has been really, really a brick, a foundation,'' he said. ''She's been holding it down, keeping our spirits up.''</p>
        <p>Cornelius and Olivia Floyd adopted Shanta when they lived outside Chicago. Floyd had just begun his minor league career with Montreal when Olivia Floyd, volunteering at the elementary school her younger son, Julius, attended, noticed a waiflike girl whose adoptive parents could not handle her and gave her up.</p>
        <p>It did not take long for the Floyds to find out why after they adopted her. Angry at being abandoned again, Shanta fought constantly with her new mother and siblings, and it continued into her teenage years.</p>
        <p>''I was just rebellious,'' Shanta said Saturday as she and her family watched Cliff and the Mets play the Cardinals at Tradition Field. ''I just wanted to do my thing my own way. I was a typical teenager. I didn't need anybody.''</p>
        <p>''She repelled everybody,'' Olivia Floyd said. ''She wasn't likable. Clifford was like: 'Why don't you do something about her? Why don't you send her back?' I said: 'You can't do that. She's a person.'''</p>
        <p>Mother and daughter fought when Shanta became pregnant the first time. Olivia said she had to be more of a mother than a grandmother to Jaylen. Then Shanta headed for Minnesota and left him behind rather than tell the family she was pregnant again. She got a job working at Camp Snoopy in the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, for $9 an hour.</p>
        <p>But Shanta called occasionally. About a year later, in October 2003, Olivia Floyd said, the family coaxed Shanta to return with her newborn daughter. ''I was raising Jaylen, and I thought we had to be a family again,'' Olivia said.</p>
        <p>Since Shanta returned home, Olivia Floyd said, she has the daughter she always hoped for. Shanta takes responsibility for the children, prays with her mother and shares things she never shared before.</p>
        <p>The night she returned to Florida, Shanta lay in bed talking to her mother when she complained about pain in her left breast. It was cancer, and that stunned everyone. The National Cancer Institute does not keep statistics on the likelihood of women under 30 contracting breast cancer because it occurs so rarely.</p>
        <p>A mastectomy and chemotherapy appeared to put the cancer in remission. Then came the headaches, and more heartache.</p>
        <p>''She had started growing her hair back,'' Cliff Floyd said. ''She was looking nice again. I called them and it was like, man, she's losing it again.''</p>
        <p>Floyd calls every day and visits when he can, as he did Wednesday and Thursday nights, before and after the Mets played the Orioles in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for me to get really deeply into it,'' Floyd said. ''There's not too much you can really do, just support her.''</p>
        <p>Baseball gives Floyd, who is divorced, a respite from the sadness.</p>
        <p>''Baseball separates from real life,'' he said. ''It's like going to sleep. When you check somebody who's sleeping, they look peaceful. Baseball allows you to be peaceful. Then you step off the field and come to the locker room, and real life is hard. Baseball, it's not hard at all.''</p>
        <p>Unless you are injured, as Floyd has been since signing with the Mets. After two subpar years brought on by leg problems, Floyd, who turned 32 in December, said he was finally running normally.</p>
        <p>Last season, the always-candid Floyd acknowledged that his injuries were taking a toll and that he might retire when his contract ran out after the 2006 season. The comments created consternation within the Mets' front office, although Floyd was guilty only of honesty.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how much time I've got left in this game, but I'm going to appreciate every day and go from there,'' he said. ''If I stay on the field, I'll do what I'm supposed to do.''</p>
        <p>Off the field, he thinks of Shanta. One day last week, he called home to check on her. Cancer patients have good days and bad days, and this was a good one for Shanta, a petite young woman with big, expressive eyes and a smile as warm as a Florida afternoon.</p>
        <p>''My mom and dad are strong people,'' Floyd said. ''They're holding up good. My mom can't see any other way, bless her heart. All I have to do is do my job.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets be at the Cardinals, 3-2, in Port St. Lucie, the difference being Carlos Beltran's fifth-inning solo homer. Tom Glavine pitched four no-hit innings, getting 10 of 12 outs on grounders. José Reyes had three hits and stole his sixth base, and David Wright doubled in two runs.</p>
