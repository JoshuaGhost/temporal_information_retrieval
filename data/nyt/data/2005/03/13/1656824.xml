        <p>Iraqi Weapons Were Looted  Looters dismantled and removed machinery from weapons installations after Baghdad fell in 2003, including some with equipment capable of making parts for nuclear arms. An Iraqi official said it appeared that a operation made the plants its targets, looking for dual use equipment, which can be used for both military and civilian applications.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Gunmen in Mosul killed three Iraqi police officers as they drove to a colleague's funeral. In Baghdad, American military officials said they had begun an investigation into the possible mistreatment of civilian detainees by six marines.</p>
        <p>20</p>
        <p>The Iraqi insurgency appears to have mounted a full-scale propaganda war. Most militant groups now rely on the Web to recruit new adherents, but the recent flurry of propaganda from Iraq has a distinctly defensive sound.</p>
        <p>22</p>
        <p>Syrian Lebanon Withdrawal  President Bashar al-Assad of Syria agreed to carry out the terms of a United Nations resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from Lebanon, offering to set a timetable for the pullout as well, according to the Syrian official news agency and a United Nations envoy.</p>

        <p>Hamas Ends Election Boycott  The Islamic group Hamas confirmed publicly that it will participate in Palestinian legislative elections, ending a 10-year boycott of the Palestinian Authority. The announcement is a victory for the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who is trying to bring Hamas and its militant ally, Islamic Jihad, into mainstream Palestinian politics.</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>Iran Clings to Nuclear Power  Iran reacted testily to a statement from the United States that it should give up its nuclear program in return for economic incentives, saying that it would not give up its right to nuclear power.</p>
        <p>14</p>
        <p>New Education Policy in China  China will begin eliminating rural school fees in response to growing criticism that the education system is increasingly corrupt and discriminates against poor rural students.</p>

        <p>Atlanta Suspect Arrested  A killing spree that terrorized Atlanta ended when a man accused of killing a judge and two other people during a courthouse rampage surrendered peacefully after a SWAT team cornered him in the apartment of a woman he had taken hostage. The police said that the man is also a suspect in the shooting death of an off-duty federal customs agent.</p>
        <p>24</p>
        <p>Prepared News Reports  At least 20 federal agencies have made prepackaged, ready-to-serve television news segments in the past four years and distributed them to local stations across the country, and many were broadcast without any acknowledgement of the government's role in their production.</p>

        <p>Judge Blocks Detainee Transfer  A federal judge prohibited the government from transferring 13 Yemeni prisoners from the military's detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, until a hearing could be held on their lawyers' fear that they might face torture if sent to another country..</p>
        <p>29</p>
