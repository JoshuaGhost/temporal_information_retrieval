        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Avoiding the Past, a Role Model Is History'' (March 18) by George Vecsey: Mark McGwire is concerned about one thing: being voted into the Hall of Fame. After hitting 70 home runs in 1998, he was an odds-on favorite to gain induction.</p>
        <p>McGwire and his attorney decided to employ a ''rope-a-dope'' strategy (to quote one congressman) during the hearings on steroid use by baseball players. McGwire repeatedly refused to discuss the role of steroids in his career, and tearfully volunteered to lead a campaign against their use by young athletes. The strategy was a colossal disaster.</p>
