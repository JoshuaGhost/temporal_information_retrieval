        <p>So far, the best moment on ''Wonder Showzen,'' the scrappy new variety show on MTV2, came during a special report in which Trevor, a smart-aleck kid, told a racetrack regular that he wanted to do an impression of him.</p>
        <p>''Let me see what you're going to do,'' the man said.</p>
        <p>Trevor geared up and took the microphone. ''Gamble, gamble, gamble, die,'' he said. The boy collapsed into a cartoonish death pose.</p>
        <p>Um. The old man surveyed the track. ''This is a bad habit,'' he agreed.</p>
        <p>O.K., there has been another memorable moment, in what is shaping up to be a freaky and funny show. (''Wonder Showzen'' started on March 11; new episodes are televised on Fridays.) It was the song ''Slaves,'' which immediately followed Trevor and the gambler. ''Slaves'' was accompanied by a video showing children cavorting against dropped-in backdrops of Egypt, Greece and Mount Rushmore.</p>
        <p>''Slaves!'' went the unlikely song: ''Built the pyramids! Slaves! Built the Parthenon! Slaves! Built America! Slaves -- this is your song. Thank you, slaves.'' The gentle synth-driven ending was surprisingly stirring.</p>
        <p>The truth is, in this jumpy, bullying and in many ways off-putting show, there have been at least a dozen moments of humorous provocation. ''Wonder Showzen'' is a messy mix of animation and live action, part ''Sesame Street'' parody, part stoner indulgence, part lazy censor-baiting, part pure inspiration. Sometimes, as at the racetrack and with the ''Slaves'' song, the humor has the right bite. And when it doesn't, there's always another sketch that might hit, and anyway at every turn there's something hypnotic about the show's fleeting visual risks.</p>
        <p>For instance, ''Wonder Showzen'' is big on iconoclastic uses of children. On the first episode it played vintage film of children being exploited in stunts (a little girl enduring a knife-throwing demo, a baby wailing on Santa's lap) alongside the image of little John F. Kennedy Jr., saluting his dead father. Yikes. Not gentle humor; rather, a genuine risk, an invitation to twist that old image. Is it still too soon?</p>
        <p>Just so it's clear, the show, which uses children's voices and images and was originally called ''Kids' Show,'' is not for kids. A preshow warning reads, in part, ''Wonder Showzen contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children,'' adding, ''If you allow a child to watch this show, you are a bad parent or guardian.''</p>
        <p>If it's not for boys of 11 or 12, who's it for? Adults, apparently, or whoever watched ''Beavis and Butt-head'' on MTV and whoever now watches ''Crank Yankers'' and ''South Park'' on Comedy Central. Its crudeness and tone is in line with those shows, but its preoccupations are somewhat different.</p>
        <p>Meat, for one, seems to fascinate the ''Wonder Showzen'' creators, John Lee and Vernon Chatman. Characters call one another ''meat-faced'' and some children narrate a disturbing tour of a hotdog factory. (''Delicious murder!'' ''Hotdogs give me energy so I can fight off my demons!'') Trevor, who does sleuthing in a trench coat in a segment called ''Beat Kids,'' visits a butcher in one sketch. Surveying the carnage, he asks the boss, ''Who's going to pay for these steaks -- I mean, spiritually?''</p>
        <p>These questions don't seem to be jokes, entirely. And another sketch, involving the ''Sesame Street''-style puppets, sounds serious, too. It might even be the overarching point of this dark show, which makes a theme of its self-loathing: ''We're on an adventure! You're not on an adventure! 'Cause you're sitting on your couch like a loser. Smash your TV and have adventures.''</p>
        <p>'Wonder Showzen'</p>
        <p>MTV2, tomorrow night at 9:30, Eastern time; 6:30, Pacific time.</p>
        <p>Creators and executive producers, John Lee and Vernon Chatman; executive producers for MTV2, Tom Calderone, Michele Dix and Jesse Ignjatovic.</p>
