      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Canadian violinist Corey Cerovsek is a well-kept secret, at least in New York, where he seldom performs. But Mr. Cerovsek is a formidable talent whose playing combines an exciting spontaneity and a powerful technique with an old-world charm that was no doubt encouraged by his former teacher, Josef Gingold, a great American pedagogue with links to the 19th-century Franco-Belgian violin tradition.</p>
        <p>All this came through in a program of Beethoven Sonatas he performed on Thursday night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, together with an excellent Finnish pianist, Paavali Jumppanen.</p>

        <p>The Canadian violinist Corey Cerovsek is a well-kept secret, at least in New York, where he seldom performs. But Mr. Cerovsek is a formidable talent whose playing combines an exciting spontaneity and a powerful technique with an old-world charm that was no doubt encouraged by his former teacher, Josef Gingold, a great American pedagogue with links to the 19th-century Franco-Belgian violin tradition.</p>
        <p>All this came through in a program of Beethoven Sonatas he performed on Thursday night at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, together with an excellent Finnish pianist, Paavali Jumppanen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cerovsek, 32, was a child prodigy. And while his boyish looks, floppy curls and casual manner still make him seem quite young, his playing suggests something deeper and more mature.</p>
        <p>The program consisted of the Sonatas Nos. 3, 6 and 9, the last of these being the famous ''Kreutzer'' Sonata. It is a risky calling card for a fiddle player, since it is so easy to lose one's individuality in the imposing shadow cast by such a war horse.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cerovsek did nothing of the sort, attacking the outer movements with a crackling energy and a striking technical prowess put to the service of musical demands. His creative variation in fingering made repeated figures sound different each time, and he rendered Beethoven's tumbling passagework with an unusual combination of sweeping momentum and clarity.</p>
        <p>There were also touches of a more vintage elegance in the sweetness of his tone and the occasional sprinkling of portamento. At the same time, his love for climbing perilously high on the instrument's lowest string gave the reading an exciting virtuoso flare.</p>
        <p>The other sonatas were also strong, though the various slow movements were less focused and entrancing. Mr. Cerovsek seemed content to point out doorways to the music's more sublime regions without actually taking us through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jumppanen, who has recorded a new disc of solo piano music by Pierre Boulez, was a deft and sensitive partner: rhythmically incisive, harmonically aware and, like Mr. Cerovsek, an unassuming presence who makes a bold statement.</p>
