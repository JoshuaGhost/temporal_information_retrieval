      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial calls for Supreme Court to restore free speech rights of Ulysses Tory, who was ordered by California court not to talk about lawyer Johnnie Cochran ever again in public in culmination of longtime dispute between them; case arose when Tory hired Cochran to bring suit on his behalf but had numerous complaints about firm's work, which he was not shy about verbalizing; Cochran complained he was being defamed</p>

        <p>Johnnie Cochran is known for being able to wring almost any result he wants out of the legal system. If he didn't prove that in the O.J. Simpson trial, he surely has in the bizarre case of Tory v. Cochran, which was argued in the Supreme Court this week. Mr. Cochran convinced a California court to order Ulysses Tory, a longtime critic, never to talk about him again. That is brilliant lawyering, but terrible First Amendment law. The Supreme Court should restore Mr. Tory's free speech rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tory hired Mr. Cochran's firm to bring a civil rights lawsuit on his behalf after he was fired on by law enforcement officers while leaving a fish market. He had numerous complaints about the firm's work, and eventually began standing outside Mr. Cochran's Los Angeles offices with disparaging signs, including ''You've been a BAD BOY, Johnnie L. Cochran.''</p>

        <p>Johnnie Cochran is known for being able to wring almost any result he wants out of the legal system. If he didn't prove that in the O.J.

Mr. Cochran convinced a California court to order Ulysses Tory, a longtime critic, never to talk about him again. That is brilliant lawyering, but terrible First Amendment law. The Supreme Court should restore Mr. Tory's free speech rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tory hired Mr. Cochran's firm to bring a civil rights lawsuit on his behalf after he was fired on by law enforcement officers while leaving a fish market. He had numerous complaints about the firm's work, and eventually began standing outside Mr. Cochran's Los Angeles offices with disparaging signs, including ''You've been a BAD BOY, Johnnie L. Cochran.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran sued Mr. Tory for defamation. He didn't ask for damages. Instead, he asked that Mr. Tory be stopped from speaking in the future. Mr. Cochran prevailed, and got a court order that Mr. Tory could not say anything about him in any public forum. Mr. Tory appealed, arguing that this sweeping prohibition violated his free speech rights. Incredibly, two appeals courts refused to overturn it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran has tried to justify the order by saying that Mr. Tory was picketing in an attempt to extort money. But what is being suppressed here is speech, plain and simple. The best deterrents to defamation and extortion are criminal charges and civil lawsuits for damages, not court orders prohibiting people from speaking. If Mr. Tory says anything in the future that meets the legal definition of defamation or extortion, there are few people in the world in a better position to make him pay than Mr. Cochran.</p>
