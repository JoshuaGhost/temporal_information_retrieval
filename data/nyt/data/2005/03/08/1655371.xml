        <p>The Colorado Ballet provided dancegoers with a sample of its wide repertory on Sunday afternoon. Its performance at Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College included two ambitious ensemble pieces for 12 dancers.</p>
        <p>Konstantin Uralsky, a Russian-born, Bolshoi-trained choreographer, created ''Rachmaninoff Second'' to that composer's Piano Concerto No. 2. The ballet has some striking moments, including the opening sequence in which dancers step carefully forward until they find themselves swept away by the music. There are attractive slow-motion sequences during the concerto's second movement, and the finale is notable for its quick entrances and exits,</p>
        <p>But Mr. Uralsky's choreographic invention only fitfully matches the power of the score. Too often, this is a polite ballet to passionate, sometimes unruly, music. Yet it did demonstrate that the Denver company, which Martin Fredmann directs, can dance strongly and lucidly.</p>
        <p>Darrell Grand Moultrie's ''Vital Sensations,'' which concluded the matinee, was a festive suite that set its cast slinking and slithering to Latin American and Caribbean rhythms. At last, everyone seemed infected with a happy choreographic fever.</p>
        <p>All the dances were performed to recordings, and between the ensembles came snippets of varying quality. A pas de deux from ''The Talisman,'' which Marius Petipa choreographed in 1889, received a bravura performance by Sharon Wehner, whose point steps were delicate and precise, and Koichi Kubo, who whirled and leaped with brio.</p>
        <p>An attractive excerpt from Christopher Wheeldon's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' showed Titania (Maria Mosina) and Oberon (Igor Vassin) reconciled after a quarrel over a changeling child (Alyssa Cannalte). Mr. Wheeldon expressed their joy with smooth, softly flowing movements.</p>
        <p>Two other tidbits were less effective. Toru Shimazaki's ''Without Words,'' danced by Ms. Mosina and Chauncey Parsons, was crammed with so many odd off-balance tilts, clutches and distraught gesticulations that it threatened to produce visual indigestion. In a sequence from Michael Pink's ''Dracula,'' Oleg Dedogryuk, as Dracula, loomed menacingly over Chandra Gercke. But, out of context, this excerpt had little dramatic impact.</p>
