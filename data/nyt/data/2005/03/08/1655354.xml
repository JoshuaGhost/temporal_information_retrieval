        <p>The Yellow Pages Group, Canada's largest publisher of telephone directories, secured most of the Canadian market on Monday, saying it would purchase Advertising Directory Solutions Holdings from Bain Capital for 2.55 billion Canadian dollars ($2.07 billion).</p>
        <p>The Yellow Pages Group controls most of the directory business in eastern Canada, while A.D.S., which is being sold by Bain Capital, is the leading publisher in the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Bain is based in Boston.</p>
        <p>''The walking fingers go west,'' Marc Tellier, chief executive of the Yellow Pages Group, which is based in Montreal, said in a conference call with analysts. ''This will give us a single brand coast to coast.''</p>
        <p>Both the Yellow Pages Group and A.D.S., which markets its directories under the SuperPages name, are offshoots of telephone companies.</p>
        <p>The Yellow Pages Group was acquired in 2002 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan from BCE, the parent company of Bell Canada. The following year it was converted to a publicly traded income fund, which distributes all profits in cash to unit holders.</p>
        <p>A.D.S., which is based in Burnaby, British Columbia, is now on its third owner. The Telus Corporation, the dominant phone company in British Columbia and Alberta, sold it to Verizon in 2001 for $520 million. Bain Capital then acquired it last September for 1.99 billion Canadian dollars. The Yellow Pages Group was an unsuccessful bidder at that time.</p>
        <p>One of Bain's first moves was a decision in December to shut down all A.D.S. operations outside of British Columbia, Alberta and northeastern Quebec. The company's SuperPages struggled badly in areas where it was in direct competition with the Yellow Pages. By some estimates, the eastern Canadian operations were losing about 25 million Canadian dollars a year.</p>
        <p>Timothy Weil, a spokesman for the Canadian government's competition bureau, said that the agency would review the planned merger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tellier estimated that the merger would increase the cash available for distribution to Yellow Pages unit holders by 6 percent. Yellow Pages anticipates that the combined company will post earnings of 587 million Canadian dollars on sales of 1.52 billion Canadian dollars.</p>
