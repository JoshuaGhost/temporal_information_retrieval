        <p>The paisley pill sure looks friendly, waving as it walks jauntily across the computer screen. It's called Progenitorivox, and is apparently good for what ails you. But look out for those side effects, which include, in rhyme, ''constipation, male lactation'' and ''rust-colored urination.''</p>
        <p>Progenitorivox is a fake pill -- not a placebo, but a fiction devised as part of a campaign by Consumers Union to pass legislation requiring drug makers to disclose the side effects of their products.</p>
        <p>The turn to humor is out of character for Consumers Union, admitted its Internet advocacy manager, Kathy Mitchell, who added, ''We're the test-and-inform people.''</p>
        <p>The group commissioned the goofy tune, ''The Drugs I Need,'' from the Austin Lounge Lizards, a band that plays a twisted blend of folk, country and bluegrass, with eclectic forays into gospel, surf music, grunge and jazz.</p>
        <p>Their music has always tweaked convention in the name of fun, and often with a political tang; their other songs have titles like ''That Godforsaken Hellhole I Call Home,'' and ''Jesus Loves Me but He Can't Stand You.''</p>
        <p>The drug song (online at www.consumersunion.org) skewers not just side effects, but also the escalating price of drugs, the billions spent on advertising and the rapid-fire disclaimers at the end of real drug ads. The Progenitorivox warnings include ''do not resume sexual activity while operating heavy machinery without consulting your physician,'' and ''for erections lasting longer than four hours, insert your own joke here.'' The video will also be featured on the political comedy site JibJab.</p>
        <p>The pharmaceutical industry does not find the video all that amusing. ''It's a catchy jingle all right and good for a laugh,'' said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, ''but we really ought to be having serious conversations about how best to help doctors and their patients choose the right medicines.'' He said information on drugs could be found at sites like www.clinicaltrialresults.org.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Hank Card, a co-founder of the group, said that ''bluegrass has traditionally, by definition, been more resistant to change than promoting social change.''</p>
        <p>He noted, though, that the song was not pure bluegrass; it has a swing flavor. ''We're taking bluegrass,'' he said, ''where it was never meant to go.''</p>
