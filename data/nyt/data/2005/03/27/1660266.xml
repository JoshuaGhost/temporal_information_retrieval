        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was enchanted by Nikki Finke's article about the Plaza (''Back When the Plaza Was the Plaza,'' March 20). As a child of the 60's I missed the debutante balls. I spent my teenage years in Central Park in what my mother called ''shmattes,'' Yiddish for rags. I was, however, a princess under the ripped jeans and tie-dyed T-shirt. I had been at the Plaza for tea at the Palm Court. I would not stoop to using the public toilets at the Central Park Zoo, but held out for the ladies' room in the Plaza. At that time it was just inside the main entrance to the right and could be accessed without notice by the staff. I have since been to the Plaza for parties and conferences, but my fondest memories are of the sheer relief of being in the Plaza bathroom after pretending to be a hippie for the afternoon!</p>
