        <p>DAVID PASTERNACK has the culinary equivalent of a wicked sense of humor.</p>
        <p>Five years ago at Esca, the Italian seafood restaurant, Mr. Pasternack decked raw fish in oil and herbs, declared it crudo and delivered to calorie-conscious, carbohydrate-phobic diners a protein-centric gift that kept on giving. New York morphed into a crudo-palooza, and Mr. Pasternack watched what might have been an evanescent fad turn into an apparently enduring fixture.</p>
        <p>His follow-up? Potatoes. At Bistro du Vent, Mr. Pasternack, in partnership with Joseph Bastianich and Mario Batali, has created his own private Idaho, a place where, if I may mix my geographical metaphors, diners heretofore victorious over starches are bound to meet their Waterloo.</p>
        <p>How will they resist the thin slices of potato that accompany the lamb? These are cooked beneath that lamb and other meats (pork, chicken) on the restaurant's busy spit so that they soak up the drippings.</p>
        <p>Or the lofty, regally golden potato cake that accompanies the chicken? This cake is oily in the center and crunchy at the edges to precisely the right degrees, like an order of hash browns that's been to finishing school and graduated first in its class.</p>
        <p>Or, most insidious of all, the ''pommes frites''? They come, as they must, in a salty heap beside a grilled sirloin steak, although they can also be ordered on their own, and they exemplify Mr. Pasternack's willingness to throw nutritional vogues and cardiovascular concerns to the wind.</p>
        <p>The restaurant fries them in a combination of peanut oil and lard, with blissfully addictive results. A friend of mine suggested that they be advertised, in the manner of special fish, as ''line-caught.''</p>
        <p>While the potatoes may be mere sides, they're central to understanding Bistro du Vent, which cares less for wowing diners than for sating them. It stakes its claim on mostly familiar turf, with appealing iterations of the kind of French fare -- with an emphasis on southern French fare -- known more for its robustness than refinement. This restaurant's mission is not invention but accessibility.</p>
        <p>The prices reflect that goal. An entree of braised beef, so tender that it seems to sigh when a fork presses into it, is $18. A very deep crock of very filling onion soup, thickened not only with croutons but also with marrow, is $6. Two fantastic appetizer skewers of lamb hearts, veal kidneys and squares of bacon are $7, which may well qualify as the best flavor-for-buck deal in the city.</p>
        <p>Not everything on the menu is a similar bargain, but nothing is unreasonable, and the entree portions tend to be generous. The entirely French wine list includes many inexpensive selections.</p>
        <p>All in all, a diner can leave Bistro du Vent with a light head, a swollen belly, a sense that he or she has witnessed the genuinely accomplished efforts of extremely savvy restaurateurs and the added satisfaction of not having gone broke in the process. That's an almost criminally rare experience in the central precincts of Manhattan these days, and Bistro du Vent gets big points for it.</p>
        <p>It needs them to compensate for significant shortcomings. The restaurant occupies a sometimes desolate, windy (''vent'' means wind in French) and ugly stretch of 42nd Street, and its interior is no more blessed. The cramped bar area is a terrible place to wait for a table, and the main dining room has a low-ceiling, dead-end dreariness that seems to resist the restaurateurs' poignantly dogged efforts at improvement.</p>
        <p>Since Bistro du Vent opened in January, I have watched the color of the walls above the tufted red leather banquettes change from antique white to chartreuse-tinged mustard, and I have seen a set of garishly unattractive light fixtures yield to lovely ones. But at night the dining room remains a downer, and a sometimes ear-splitting one at that. By day it's calmer and more cheerful, and I'd be tempted to designate Bistro du Vent a better lunch than dinner destination if its menu didn't seem more suited to end-of-day appetites.</p>
        <p>About three-quarters of the dishes are good or even better, a success rate matched by few restaurants in its sub-section of midtown. The only out-and-out clunker that I encountered among the appetizers was the grilled shrimp.</p>
        <p>I couldn't summon much excitement for the country pâté or the red and yellow beets, either. But ample redemption came in the forms of a luscious mousselike chicken liver pâté, a fantastic boudin blanc of chicken and sweetbreads, and a textbook frisée aux lardons that avoided the over-vinegary errors of so many of its peers around town.</p>
        <p>Among entrees Bistro du Vent excels at beef. In addition to the terrific sirloin, which comes with anchovy-rosemary oil atop it, and the braised beef, which has hints of orange and olive, there's a rib-eye for two. It has less adornment, and rightly so. Meat this fine needs little assistance.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's spit turns out to be a fickle friend. It did not fail the pork loin the two times I tried it. But while it once produced a near-perfect half chicken, the skin of which was exalted by black truffles, it twice yielded slightly dry breast meat. The lamb shank, seasoned with nutmeg, cloves and cardamom, was commendably tender on one visit and slightly stringy (though still flavorful) on another.</p>
        <p>Among seafood entrees, I had a delightful grilled dourade, seasoned with Meyer lemon and tarragon oil, and an equally delightful white stew of monkfish and cod in a pool of fish stock, aioli and almonds.</p>
        <p>Desserts proved to be a trickier arena. Only the apple tart thrilled me, while pot de crème and a lemon tart simply accomplished their pleasant paces. The pink peppercorn ice cream with spit-roasted pineapple actually frightened me. The profiteroles were irritating. It's one thing for a restaurant to make them crunchier than usual. It's quite another to end up with veritable fortune cookies.</p>
        <p>At least Bistro du Vent's errors of judgment or execution were not the result of self-conscious whimsy. What I respect so much about Mr. Bastianich and Mr. Batali, the duo behind Babbo, Otto, Lupa and Casa Mono, is that their formidable successes have given them every reason for vanity, but their restaurants are mostly purged of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pasternack, who joined forces with them first as the chef at Esca and now as the chef at Bistro du Vent, seems to share their values. His crudo clairvoyance could have made him intent on a visionary next act. But his new restaurant borrows humbly and affectionately from the past.</p>
        <p>It's a place for diners who are suffering dazzle fatigue, and who have the wisdom to recognize a potato thoroughbred and the flexibility to submit to its spud service.</p>
        <p>Bistro du Vent **  [Rating: Two Stars]  411 West 42nd Street, Midtown; (212) 239-3060.</p>
        <p>ATMOSPHERE -- The look and feel of a classic bistro, but with an often cramped bar area and a drearily dark dining room that undercuts the conviviality.  SOUND LEVEL -- At some tables, loud enough to make conversation difficult.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Frisée aux lardons; brochettes with lamb hearts and veal kidneys; boudin blanc; chicken liver pâté; braised beef; pork loin; steak frites; apple tart; hazelnut sour cherry cake.  WINE LIST -- About 275 wines, all French and many very affordable. About 14 wines available by the pichet, a carafe that is about one-third of a bottle.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $6 to $14. Entrees, $16 to $30. Desserts, $7.  HOURS -- Lunch, 11:45 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. daily. Dinner, 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, and from 5 p.m. all other days.  RESERVATIONS -- For prime dinner times, it is wise to call about a week ahead.  CREDIT CARDS -- All major cards.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- Front part of dining room and restrooms at street level.</p>
        <p>WHAT THE STARS MEAN:  (None) Poor to satisfactory  * Good  ** Very good  *** Excellent  **** Extraordinary</p>
