        <p>SMOKING is frowned upon at work, in restaurants and in courtrooms and legislatures. But there is one place where tobacco has been not only accepted but also preferred: Wall Street. Shares of tobacco companies have been stellar performers: those in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index were up 8.6 percent this year , though the index over all gained only 0.8 percent.</p>
        <p>A similar pattern has held up over the last five years. The S.&amp;P. 500 fell 2.2 percent, annualized, over that turbulent time, while the tobacco component shows an annualized gain of 26.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Yet there are fears on Wall Street that an end to the big gains, or any gains at all, may be at hand.</p>
        <p>Certainly, some analysts are confident that the stocks will stay strong. The companies earn good money and have dividend yields of about 4 percent to 6 percent -- bigger than those of almost every other market sector. But the industry has many doubters, especially because of the stocks' already-long bull run. To them, the legal and social headwind makes the sector too risky and makes the prospects for continued growth questionable.</p>
        <p>''Most investors don't want to touch these things,'' said Gil Knight, senior fund manager at Gartmore Global Investors near Philadelphia. ''There is such a furor over smoking that people feel the potential ramifications make tobacco something they don't want to mess with.'' Beyond the steady stream of lawsuits, many states and municipalities have outlawed smoking in indoor public places.</p>
        <p>Although tobacco companies will keep making appearances in court, many investors are finding the litigation environment more encouraging for the industry than it has been in the recent past. Damage awards are being overturned or cut, and a federal appellate panel last month tossed out a damage claim in a government lawsuit with the trial still in progress.</p>
        <p>A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that tobacco makers, being prosecuted under racketeering laws, could not be forced to hand over $280 billion -- an estimate of the profits earned on cigarette sales between 1971 and 2000 -- if they lose their case, as the government had sought.</p>
        <p>David Adelman, who follows the industry for Morgan Stanley, told the bank's clients that ''an awful lot would have to go wrong'' for the ruling to be reversed. He said he expected the ruling to be ''the last word on the issue.''</p>
        <p>Suzanne Chamberlain, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in New York, agreed that the ruling ''absolutely helped'' the industry. Anticipation of it was buoying the stocks since November, she said.</p>
        <p>But absolutely may not mean finally. ''I don't think that's necessarily the last word,'' she said. ''The government can appeal, and rumor is that it's planning to do that.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, she said, scanning the legal backdrop, ''generally over the last couple of years things have become more favorable, and that has helped both the stocks and bonds'' of tobacco companies. While the authorities may want to keep the industry down, she added, they do not want to knock it out.</p>
        <p>''They get all this money back from tobacco'' in taxes, she noted. ''Do they really want to run these guys out of business?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adelman, at Morgan Stanley, has rated the industry ''attractive'' for the last two years. He recommends that investors be overweight in the Altria Group and the Carolina Group, compared with their proportion in stock indexes, underweight in UST and ''equal weight'' in Reynolds American, the company formed last year from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's acquisition of the Brown &amp; Williamson division of British American Tobacco.</p>
        <p>Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Smith Barney, said in a note to investors in late January that she is ''bullish on the tobacco industry due to both strengthening fundamentals in the U.S. and an improving litigation environment.''</p>
        <p>She called Altria, which makes Philip Morris cigarette brands, her top pick in the sector and raised her target price to $80 a share from $68. The stock now trades at $66.05. In her note, she cited ''several positive catalysts,'' including improved growth prospects abroad, especially in Japan.</p>
        <p>Altria is a nearly universal favorite. It is the only tobacco stock that Mr. Knight holds. He likes its dividend of 4.4 percent, but more important, he said, is the possibility that the company will split into separate entities for its tobacco and food interests, mainly the Kraft brands.</p>
        <p>''We think this is a special situation,'' he said. ''We think the breakup value is much greater than the current share price.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Herzog has ''hold'' ratings on Reynolds American and Carolina, which makes Lorillard brands. She raised her target price on Reynolds to $82 from $77, based on the company's ''improving fundamentals and the possibility that Reynolds American may try and grow its top line by expanding its business into smokeless tobacco.'' The stock now trades at $84.79.</p>
        <p>She raised her target on Carolina, too, to $31 from $29. Despite maintaining her hold rating, she said, ''we continue to recommend investors trade into this name for the short term.'' Carolina now trades at $32.87.</p>
        <p>But she advised selling stock of UST, a maker of smokeless tobacco products, arguing that it had risen substantially in the last year, to the point that she considered it overvalued.</p>
        <p>Tobacco purveyors may be fending off much of the legal challenge to their businesses in the United States, but some investors prefer to own companies that ply their trade abroad, where attitudes toward smoking are often more relaxed and courtroom brawls can be avoided.</p>
        <p>Hugh Young, the Singapore-based head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, likes tobacco stocks in Asia and Latin America for their ''good cash flow, good yield and lowish valuations,'' but he also appreciates their relative immunity from legal trouble, even if he is embarrassed to acknowledge it. ''It sounds dreadful, but yes, it helps,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Aberdeen holds three affiliates of British American Tobacco: BAT Malaysia, BAT Indonesia and Souza Cruz in Brazil. Mr. Young said he also has a stake in the parent company, which is based in Britain and trades on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Tobacco sellers in Europe may face less of a legal threat than their American counterparts, but that may not make them more appealing as investments.</p>
        <p>''European tobacco continues to be at a premium to the U.S. due to litigation fears hanging over the latter,'' said Tom Elliott, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in London. ''This is likely to persist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Elliott said he would rather hold off on investing in the industry after its strong run.</p>
        <p>''We like the global tobacco sector long term, but short term we are a bit apprehensive due to the re-rating the sector had last year,'' he said, referring to the climb in share valuations.</p>
        <p>EXCEPTIONS, he said, include Altria, because of its potentially higher value if the company is broken up, and Reynolds American, which he said is ''still reaping benefits'' from the deal that formed it last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight is less sanguine about growth prospects over the long haul and about tolerance for smoking overseas. He pointed out that governments in Europe and Asia were starting to restrict smoking.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to see usage of cigarettes actually going up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He conceded that the industry is ''a huge cash-flow machine,'' but he added that ''it's hard to put much of a growth case on tobacco, and there's a lot of risk investing in these stocks.''</p>
