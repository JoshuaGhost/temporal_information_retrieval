        <p>AN old recording of Stravinsky's ''Symphony of Psalms'' and Bach's ''Magnificat'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan suggested little more than that the estimable maestro was out of his depth at either end of the repertory. In an imaginative new coupling from ECM, on the other hand, the Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos, thoroughly in his element throughout, shows just how much Stravinsky and Bach have to say to each other.</p>

        <p>Stravinsky: 'Duo Concertant,' 'Suite Italienne'; Bach: Solo Violin Partita No. 1, Sonata No. 1Leonidas Kavakos, violinist; Peter Nagy, pianist. ECM New Series 1855; CD.</p>
        <p>AN old recording of Stravinsky's ''Symphony of Psalms'' and Bach's ''Magnificat'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan suggested little more than that the estimable maestro was out of his depth at either end of the repertory. In an imaginative new coupling from ECM, on the other hand, the Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos, thoroughly in his element throughout, shows just how much Stravinsky and Bach have to say to each other.</p>
        <p>As has often been noted, Stravinsky's ''Neo-Classicism'' of the 1930's could as aptly be called neo-Baroque. Just listen to the running accompaniment in the Cantilène that opens the ''Duo Concertant,'' as played by the Hungarian pianist Peter Nagy, and the skittish activity of both instruments in two movements that follow. And in the ''Suite Italienne'' Stravinsky goes right to the source, reworking material from his delightful ballet ''Pulcinella,'' which itself shamelessly pilfered tunes by Pergolesi and other Baroque composers.</p>
        <p>Dances weave through the program, from a Stravinsky gigue to a Bach allemande, a Stravinsky gavotte and a Bach siciliana. And there is beautiful song from both composers, starting with that Cantilène.</p>
        <p>Well, maybe not starting just there. You might want to change the order a bit, from Stravinsky-Bach alternations to Bach-Stravinsky, and end with the nose-thumbing ''Suite Italienne.'' As it is, the Bach sonata, coming right after, sounds needlessly sobersided.</p>
        <p>The performances, excellent in themselves, are given added immediacy by intimate miking, which even captures much of Mr. Kavakos's breathing. Mr. Kavakos (unlike Karajan) makes the necessary distinctions between the 18th century and the 20th, particularly in adjusting his use of vibrato.</p>
        <p>This is a conversation across the ages that you don't want to miss.</p>
