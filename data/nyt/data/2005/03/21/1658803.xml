        <p>ONE thing automotive claims investigators generally agree on is that would-be arsonists are not always the sharpest tools in the shed.</p>
        <p>''The stupid ones will pour gasoline around the front floor, throw in a lit book of matches and then close the door,'' said Salvatore R. Raimondi Sr., vice president of Automotive Forensic Services in West Palm Beach, Fla. ''Often the fire goes out because there's not enough oxygen.''</p>
        <p>It is a familiar occurrence in his line of work, investigating the aftermath of collisions, thefts, mechanical failures and other mishaps, including events that are thought to involve fraud.</p>
        <p>Peter A. Lynch, an attorney in San Diego, said he encountered some very incompetent arsonists while he was providing legal counsel to military personnel as a judge advocate in the Marine Corps. ''My clients weren't all that smart,'' he said. ''You'd expect them to put a little effort into the scenario, but they didn't have the capacity.''</p>
        <p>More recently, Mr. Lynch said, he has encountered cases of people setting fire to their own cars to avoid the penalties assessed when the mileage limit of a lease had been exceeded. ''Miraculously, the car catches fire just before the end of the lease.''</p>
        <p>The possibility that a car fire may have been deliberately set, and the litigation that may result from any accident, provide a livelihood for those in the specialized profession of automotive forensic investigations.</p>
        <p>The number of arsons could provide steady work: of 312,000 vehicle fires in the United States in 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available, some 10 percent were judged to have been set intentionally, according the National Fire Protection Association, which develops fire safety codes.</p>
        <p>Ralph Newell, a former police officer from Gainesville, Ga., who now conducts investigations for insurance companies and several carmakers, said that claims tend to multiply after an auto company issues a fire-related recall or technical service bulletin, an alert sent to dealership mechanics informing them of mechanical defects.</p>
        <p>''I investigate a lot of garage fires in which the owners say, 'It was the same model that got recalled, so that has to have been the cause,''' Mr. Newell said. ''But each fire is individual.</p>
        <p>''In 2001, I investigated a house fire in Mississippi that the local fire marshal said was started by the ignition switch in the owner's Lincoln Town Car. That meant Ford would be responsible.</p>
        <p>''But my investigation showed that it was caused by some aftermarket equipment the owner had installed, and the verdict went in favor of the carmaker,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In cases involving rare or valuable cars, investigators may be called upon to determine a replacement value when all that remains is a burned hulk. This does not always result in an insurance company whittling down the settlement by proving an owner has exaggerated a loss.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, when fires in the hills above Malibu, Calif., claimed many expensive homes along with their garages, Lance S. Coren, an investigator based in Prather, Calif., near Fresno, was called in to examine the remains of a 1971 Mercedes-Benz 600 limousine. The car was said to have once belonged to Milton Berle.</p>
        <p>''The insurance company was saying it was a standard 600, worth about $50,000,'' Mr. Coren said. ''But my research revealed it to be the more valuable and rarer long-wheelbase Pullman model, worth $100,000.''</p>
        <p>Independent investigators -- who sometimes work for carmakers, other times for insurance companies or private clients -- do not hesitate to suggest that their stories would make great television shows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coren says his work frequently brings him in contact with Hollywood celebrities. The shoulder-rubbing began with an accident involving Elvis Presley's 1972 Stutz Blackhawk, a gaudy limited-production model based on a Pontiac coupe. ''I shared a peanut butter and banana sandwich with Elvis at his home in Bel Air,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The everyday detective work for corporate clients, while less glamorous, requires special qualifications. Kip Diggs, a spokesman for State Farm Insurance, confirms that the insurer uses independent forensic investigators, but only for unusual cases, handled by its investigations unit, that require in-depth information.</p>
        <p>''We don't just pull people off the streets,'' Mr. Diggs said. ''They have to follow National Fire Protection Association guidelines and submit to regular audits of their reports so we can be sure they're doing the work they're supposed to be doing.''</p>
        <p>General Motors also uses forensic specialists. ''We hire outside investigators for work on litigation and recalls, and to satisfy intellectual curiosity,'' said Brenda Rios, a G.M. spokeswoman. ''We might want to know how something works, or why a car performed the way it did in an accident.''</p>
        <p>In the course of their work, forensic investigators are regularly presented with intriguing puzzles, and even the occasional murder mystery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coren investigated a disastrous fire last year that started inside an closed transporter truck loaded with upper-crust performance cars. En route from the West Coast to the East Coast on Interstate 10, the load ignited, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to cargo that included a Ferrari 550 Maranello, a Ferrari 360 Spider, an Aston Martin Vanquish and a Mercedes-Benz SL.</p>
        <p>''I was hired by an insurance company to investigate their liability exposure,'' Mr. Coren said. ''I determined that the 1989 Ferrari Testarossa in the top forward position caught fire due to an engine-related electrical short. That shifted the liability from the carrier's insurance company to the company of the Ferrari owner, which wasn't happy it was on the hook to repair all the damaged exotic cars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newell, the former police officer, knows well that Hollywood's penchant for making vehicle fires into dramatic disasters is unrealistic -- particularly the cliché of gas tanks blowing up at the slightest provocation. Contrary to popular belief (and the fireballs that are a staple of television thrillers), he says, a tank full of gasoline does not have much room for the oxygen necessary to support combustion. ''Cars only explode in midair on 'The A Team,''' he said.</p>
        <p>Cases that possibly involve a crime can entangle a busy investigator. In 2001, Mr. Newell was featured on CBS's ''48 Hours'' after investigating a 1996 crash and fire -- and perhaps a case of murder. In this incident, Sheila Bryan of Omega, Ga., was out for a drive with her 82-year-old mother, Freda Weeks, when her 1987 Mercury Cougar veered off the road and down an embankment, catching fire. Ms. Bryan escaped; Ms. Weeks did not.</p>
        <p>''I was a fire investigator retained by the vehicle's insurance carrier,'' Mr. Newell said. ''My research showed that the fuel cap was missing, the fuel door was open and there was evidence of accelerant pour patterns and fire at the gas filler neck.</p>
        <p>''The flame patterns were inconsistent with the car having caught fire after it came to rest,'' he said, implying that the car was ablaze before the crash.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bryan was arrested and charged with arson and murder. She was convicted in 1998, but her conviction was overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court the next year. During a second trial in 2000, the defense argued that a faulty ignition switch could have started the fire. Mr. Newell testified that such a cause was unlikely, but defense lawyers tried to cast doubt on Mr. Newell's credibility, pointing to his work as a consultant for Ford, leading a task force that investigated the switches, which were eventually recalled. Ms. Bryan was acquitted.</p>
        <p>The testimony raised interesting questions about the extent of Ford's use of private investigators. ''We're going to decline participation in this,'' said Dan Jarvis, a Ford spokesman. ''It gets into issues involving litigation and warranty recall.''</p>
        <p>Not all of Mr. Newell's cases attract so much publicity; consider one call to assist in the aftermath of a house fire.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Newell tells it, cocaine traffickers transported drugs across the country in the fuel tank of a Ford Expedition. When they arrived at their destination in suburban Atlanta, the plastic bags that held the contraband, dripping with gasoline, were tossed into a clothes dryer.</p>
        <p>''The explosion blew both of these geniuses out the front door,'' he said.</p>
