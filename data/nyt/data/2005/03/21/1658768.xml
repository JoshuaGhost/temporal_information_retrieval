        <p>The Jersey Journal is following the strategy of many English papers, moving from broadsheet to tabloid. Will other papers follow suit?</p>

        <p>The daily brew in The Jersey Journal is the stuff of tabloid heaven: a gambling boss bribes a cop; two robbers mistakenly gun down their 15-year-old accomplice; a police dog searches for the body parts of a dismembered woman whose head was found inside a bowling bag.</p>
        <p>Now the editors have decided it is time for form to match function. Today, they plan to announce they are taking the 138-year-old Jersey Journal from a broadsheet format to a tabloid.</p>
        <p>But the conversion, scheduled for April 25, is about more than finding an appropriate vessel for Jersey City's gritty news. Largely because of demographic shifts in the city, circulation at the newspaper has been dwindling for decades, to 26,600 today from more than 100,000 nearly 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>''We had to address the declining circulation of the daily,'' said Steve Newhouse, editor in chief of The Jersey Journal and chairman of Advance.net, which oversees the local Web sites of the Newhouse newspapers and the national Web sites of Cond√© Nast. ''We were nervous about putting out a tabloid, but we're making sure that The Jersey Journal has a future.''</p>
        <p>The Jersey Journal is not alone in hoping that a conversion from broadsheet to tabloid will help bring readers back. Owners of more traditional, upscale newspapers are looking at the option as well.</p>
        <p>Anthony Ridder, chairman of Knight Ridder Newspapers, said in an interview last week that he would soon identify two or three Knight Ridder markets where he planned to experiment with taking broadsheets to tabloid size. The company owns 31 daily newspapers, including The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Miami Herald and The San Jose Mercury News.</p>
        <p>''Tabs seem to work better in larger metro areas,'' Mr. Ridder said. ''Initially, people were recommending that we try this in smaller markets where there would be less at risk, but we're feeling now that to get the benefit out of it, we need to focus on our larger markets.''</p>
        <p>''So that's where we're headed,'' he added, declining to say in which markets he would start the experiment.</p>
        <p>While tabloids have caught on in Europe, American publishers have been balking because advertisers are not convinced they can get the same impact from tabloids as they can from broadsheets.</p>
        <p>But broadsheets are in a period of decline, with weakening circulation and little growth in advertising as they compete with a growing number of outlets -- including free metro tabloids -- for consumer attention and advertising dollars. With a nervous eye on long-term survival, newspaper executives are increasingly considering shrinking their formats and hoping that less will prove to be more.</p>
        <p>Scott Ring, the publisher of The Jersey Journal, said he did not expect to save much money by converting to the tabloid format. While the pages will be smaller, he said, he expects to print twice as many -- the newspaper currently has 24 pages -- and to expand sports, local news and the comics. ''It will be a wash,'' he said in terms of cost. But he hopes the new format will ''showcase the news in a more exciting way.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Jarvis, who is creative director of Advance.net and a former editor at the tabloid New York Daily News, also runs his own Internet Weblog and was a consultant on the tabloid project. He said his experience online showed him that it was necessary for newspapers to change but that they were often resistant. ''I'm amazed it took the industry this long to learn that readers preferred this format,'' he said of tabloids. ''And that the format doesn't have cooties.''</p>
        <p>But the format remains a psychological barrier for some publishers, who are ridding their vocabulary of the word tabloid and adopting instead the more up-market term ''compact.''</p>
        <p>''They don't call them tabloids,'' said Mario Garcia, a newspaper designer based in Tampa, Fla., who has overseen the conversions of 15 newspapers to smaller formats. ''Tab smells of down-market, of blood, sex and guts. You want to go to a compact. That makes you think of a small Mercedes, a small Jaguar.''</p>
        <p>In the 1600's, newspapers were pamphlets about the size of modern-day paperback books. But in England in the early 1700's, newspapers began to be taxed by their number of pages. To reduce taxes, publishers printed bigger pages and fewer of them, helping to create the broadsheet that is now considered standard.</p>
        <p>With the emergence of subways and commuters, tabloids became a staple of the culture. But the newspaper world paid new attention to tabloids in the fall of 2003, when The Independent in England, hitting a circulation crisis, offered itself in both tabloid and broadsheet form. Less than two months later, the venerable 218-year-old Times of London also offered a tabloid along with its broadsheet.</p>
        <p>Within half a year, the tabloids had proved so popular that the two newspapers dumped their broadsheets, prompting other newspapers across Europe to experiment with the smaller size and piquing the interest of American publishers.</p>
        <p>''It's in the air,'' Mr. Newhouse said.</p>
        <p>Len Kubas, president of Kubas Consultants, a media consulting firm based in Toronto, said he expected several American publishers to change to the compact size.</p>
        <p>''Newspapers are realizing that they can't continue flogging the same format and expect circulation to increase,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The European newspapers that have converted to tabloid have seen their circulations rise, especially among women and younger readers, whom advertisers covet. The Independent's readership climbed by 15 percent, though that was considered an anomaly; more typically, The Times of London was up by 3.4 percent after the switch.</p>
        <p>On the New York subway recently, Joanne Tehrani, 26, was happily reading amNewYork, one of the new tabloids being distributed for free in several metropolitan areas. ''I like the convenience of it,'' she said. ''I don't have to go to the newsstand, and I get these perfect little doses of news, which is just right for this ride.''</p>
        <p>Even in areas of the country without subways, readers seem to like the smaller size. ''We've had focus groups and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,'' said Julie Bechtel, publisher of The Bismark Tribune, a newspaper in North Dakota that will reduce its size in a few weeks. ''They were concerned they would get less news,'' she said, but readers preferred the change when shown the color, reproduction quality and ease of handling.</p>
        <p>But advertisers in Europe and elsewhere have been less enthusiastic than readers.</p>
        <p>Advertisers argue that a tabloid page is only half the size of a broadsheet page and say they should be charged only half the cost of a broadsheet ad. But newspapers argue that a full-page tabloid ad has the same impact as a full-page broadsheet and advertisers should pay the same rates.</p>
        <p>The result in Europe has been discounts, with advertisers in tabloids paying about 78 percent of what they would pay in a broadsheet, said Earl J. Wilkinson, executive director of the International Newspaper Marketing Association.</p>
        <p>He said the reduction in revenue would have a more pronounced effect in American newspapers because Americans rely on advertising for about 85 percent of their revenues, while Europeans rely on it less so, for 60 to 70 percent of total revenues.</p>
        <p>''European papers are in a better position to take a big risk like this than the Americans are,'' he said. ''In fact, I'm surprised North American papers are as far down the road to considering this as they are.''</p>
        <p>Over time, some of the fall-off in ad revenue could be made up with a gain in readers. This was the case at Le Matin, a Swiss newspaper, which lost 13 percent of its ad revenue after it converted, according to a recent study by McKinsey. But after two and a half years, the newspaper recaptured those losses as its readership rose 12 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition to advertisers, some journalists are wary of tabloids and suggest they spell a decline in editorial quality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ridder said that he did not expect the journalism at any reduced-sized Knight Ridder newspapers to change.</p>
        <p>''We're thinking of it as a different format, not that the content would change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he personally preferred reading broadsheets, but noted that he read his newspapers at home, not on a subway. ''What I like personally and what sells newspapers are two different things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia said that newspapers that kept printing their broadsheets while also offering tabloids were taking this wasteful step simply as ''therapy for the editors and reporters,'' most of whom, he said, worry that their stories will be shorter and taken less seriously.</p>
        <p>At The Jersey Journal, Judy Locorriere, the editor, said she expected stories to be shorter but said they would be ''punchier.''</p>
        <p>''We won't shortchange the reader,'' she said. ''We'll display the material differently.''</p>
        <p>Another adviser to Mr. Newhouse was Jim Willse, editor of The Star Ledger of Newark, also a Newhouse newspaper, and a former editor of The New York Daily News. Mr. Willse said journalistic concerns were overblown, and said the main goal of reformatting was to re-engage readers.</p>
        <p>''Whether you're in a classic Hudson County city or the sunny climes of San Jose, you're trying to come up with a product that has the virtues of a printed paper, that's tactile and easy to read, but is livelier, faster and visually engaging,'' he said. ''That's been the classic tab recipe. We're just rediscovering an old formula.''</p>
