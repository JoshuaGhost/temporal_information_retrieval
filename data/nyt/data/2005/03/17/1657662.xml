        <p>Billy Feeney's headband hangs from the rearview mirror of Danny Granger's car. The dresser in Granger's room at the University of New Mexico has pictures of the two, who were teammates and best friends. Granger's scrapbook has the newspaper accounts of the night when the friends separated for good.</p>
        <p>Granger, New Mexico's star 6-foot-8 forward, should be having the time of his life. The Lobos (26-6) are awaiting their first-round game in the N.C.A.A. tournament here Friday against Villanova. Barely recruited out of high school in Metairie, La., Granger, who transferred from Bradley, averaged 19 points and 8 rebounds in his senior season for the Lobos. N.B.A. scouts have told New Mexico Coach Ritchie McKay that Granger can expect to be drafted in the middle or latter stages of the first round.</p>
        <p>But Granger bows his head when he talks about Feeney, and he shakes his head slowly.</p>
        <p>''I think about him every day,'' Granger said. ''I have pictures of us together. He was the guy who kept me going when I transferred to New Mexico. He made it all right and helped me get through it.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 28, 2003, Patrick Feeney, known as Billy, hanged himself with the rope from a life preserver; it was tied around a light post in a downtown Albuquerque apartment parking lot. Feeney was a 6-foot-10 sophomore forward who had transferred from Portland State.</p>
        <p>''People talk about me playing in the N.B.A., but he was an N.B.A. prospect, too,'' Granger said.</p>
        <p>Granger said he and a teammate, Mark Walters, discovered Feeney talking to his sister on his cellphone in a downtown Albuquerque alley around 3 a.m., about two hours before he committed suicide.</p>
        <p>''He was drunk and distraught,'' Granger said. ''We tried to get him in the car. We talked to him for an hour and a half. He finally said he was going to walk to the bus station a block and a half away and go to Colorado.</p>
        <p>''I had no clue he was going to do that,'' Granger added, referring to the suicide. ''I should have gotten him in the car.''</p>
        <p>Granger said Feeney would have been a prominent part of this New Mexico team. Granger has gone on without him, and New Mexico has become his team.</p>
        <p>Granger was not recruited by a major Division I program. An honors student in high school, he was headed to Yale before the Bradley assistant Duane Broussard saw him play.</p>
        <p>Broussard said Granger was a good defensive player in high school and, though unskilled on offense, full of potential because of his athleticism.</p>
        <p>Granger averaged 11.1 points and 7.1 rebounds in his freshman season at Bradley, after which Coach Jim Molinari was fired. Granger averaged 19 points and 7.2 rebounds in 14 games as a sophomore before abruptly transferring to New Mexico in January 2003.</p>
        <p>Broussard resigned after Molinari was fired and became an assistant at New Mexico.</p>
        <p>''How does he decide in the middle of January that he is going to transfer to New Mexico?'' said Ken Kavanaugh, the Bradley athletic director. ''He was stolen by Broussard. We have the phone records to prove it.</p>
        <p>''It's been quite painful to watch him because he is a sensational player.''</p>
        <p>Broussard said he was cleared by the N.C.A.A., but New Mexico did receive a minor penalty: Broussard was required to attend a compliance seminar; he was not allowed recruiting contacts for a month; and New Mexico forfeited two days of that July's recruiting period.</p>
        <p>''They changed coaches, and the new coach and I did not get along,'' Granger said, referring to Jim Les. ''It was my decision to leave.''</p>
        <p>He just wishes Feeney had made the decision to stay.</p>
        <p>''I went home after we talked to him, and he called and said he bought the bus ticket,'' Granger said. ''The last thing he said to me was, 'Thanks, man, I love you.'''</p>
