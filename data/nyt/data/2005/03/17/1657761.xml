        <p>IN any kind of remotely fair Battle of the Saints, Joseph would smite Patrick all over the firmament. Patrick may be the patron saint of Ireland, but Joseph married the woman who soon gave birth to the savior of all Christendom.</p>
        <p>Down here in the United States, Patrick is the marquee name. Joseph's feast day falls two days after St. Patrick's, and it comes and goes without parades.</p>
        <p>But in certain corners of Brooklyn, on certain dining tables, Joseph rules. While millions will spend part of today washing down green pretzels with green beer, the borough's Italian bakeries and their customers will continue their seasonal worship of St. Joseph's pastries.</p>
        <p>The pastries are sfingi and zeppole, gifts of arterial blockage from Jesus' dietarily indulgent stepfather.</p>
        <p>The St. Joseph's zeppole, distantly related to the grease-and-air staple of countless street fairs, is a wobbly four-story structure of fried, swirled dough and vanilla custard, topped with sour-sweet amarena cherries. The sfingi is a lump of egg-based dough deep fried, split open, piled like a double-stuffed baked potato with ricotta cheese, sugar and chocolate chips (the same mixture that fills a cannoli) and crowned with a slice of candied orange rind, a maraschino cherry and a splash of green crushed nuts.</p>
        <p>Regional loyalties toward one or the other are fierce. At Fortunato Brothers bakery in Williamsburg, founded by sons of Naples, Bagio Fortunato insisted on the primacy of the zeppole.</p>
        <p>''This is the original one, made in honor of St. Joseph,'' Mr. Fortunato said on Saturday as he pointed to a custard-smeared display case. Mr. Fortunato says he sells about 100,000 St. Joseph's pastries during Lent, slightly more than half of them zeppole (including a ''light'' version built from baked dough, a concession roughly equivalent to putting diet ketchup on French fries).</p>
        <p>But Emanuele Alaimo, the owner of Villabate bakery in Bensonhurst and a proud man of Sicilian stock, sells zeppole only because he has to.</p>
        <p>''This was created as a joke,'' he said -- a sop to mainland Italians too timid to embrace the joys of ricotta. ''The sfingi is the real thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alaimo has nothing against paying lip service to St. Patrick's Day. ''I think it's great,'' he said. ''We make Irish soda bread, cupcakes. We try to cater to all races.''</p>
        <p>At Monteleone's Pasticceria in Carroll Gardens, the display window has been painted with the likeness of a man in green holding a shillelagh.</p>
        <p>It's a front. Back by the refrigerated cases, an elderly woman, Virginia Cuttitta, nee Brookhouse, was renouncing her Irish ancestry for a box of chocolate and vanilla sfingi.</p>
        <p>''You want five?'' her daughter Annette asked.</p>
        <p>''Will you eat them?'' Mrs. Cuttitta asked back.</p>
        <p>''Yeah.''</p>
        <p>''Then get six.''</p>
        <p>(For their part, the city's Irish bakeries -- all two of them -- do not carry St. Joseph's pastries. ''I've never heard about them,'' the assistant manager at the Traditional Irish Bakery in Woodlawn said before hurrying off the phone.)</p>
        <p>Back at Villabate, another customer, Anthony Trifilio, chided a tourist for eating a St. Joseph's pastry in the store. ''You've got to eat them at room temperature,'' he said. Mr. Trifilio, 45, who works in construction, was asked his impressions of St. Patrick.</p>
        <p>''He got rid of the snakes in Ireland, didn't he?'' Mr. Trifilio asked.</p>
        <p>And St. Joseph?</p>
        <p>''Joseph gave him a reason to get rid of the snakes.''</p>
