        <p>If he weren't from Colombia, a country devastated by protracted civil strife, Juanes might have made a fine career simply with his love songs. They are bright and catchy pan-American rock that can lope with the syncopations of Colombian cumbia or go bounding along like new wave rock. He sang plenty of them on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, proclaiming his passion, his loneliness or his longing for a lover's return. But he has more on his mind than romance, and so do his fans across the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
        <p>In Latin America, Juanes is a superstar. When he left his rock band Ekhymosis to start his own career in 1998, his first two albums brought him seven Latin Grammy Awards. And his most recent one, ''Mi Sangre'' (or ''My Blood'') from Surco Universal, could easily win more.</p>

        <p>Juanes merged romantic love and social compassion without sounding preachy or self-important at his show on Friday at Madison Square Garden.</p>

        <p>If he weren't from Colombia, a country devastated by protracted civil strife, Juanes might have made a fine career simply with his love songs. They are bright and catchy pan-American rock that can lope with the syncopations of Colombian cumbia or go bounding along like new wave rock. He sang plenty of them on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, proclaiming his passion, his loneliness or his longing for a lover's return. But he has more on his mind than romance, and so do his fans across the Spanish-speaking world.</p>
        <p>In Latin America, Juanes is a superstar. When he left his rock band Ekhymosis to start his own career in 1998, his first two albums brought him seven Latin Grammy Awards. And his most recent one, ''Mi Sangre'' (or ''My Blood'') from Surco Universal, could easily win more.</p>
        <p>Juanes, which is short for Juan Esteban Aristizabal, has a boyishly eager baritone and a pop heartthrob's looks. He plays brash, bluesy lead guitar. Throughout his set, women squealed at every ardent declaration when they weren't singing along. Juanes looked like a rock idol as video screens flashed behind him and an elaborate, mechanized sunburst logo -- matching one of his tattoos -- blinked overhead. Yet his serious side was never far away.</p>
        <p>On Friday night he started his set with ''Sueños'' (''Dreams''), which dreams not only of undying love but of ''peace in my bloodied country.'' In ''Rosario Tijeras,'' he mourned a street thug's dead-end life. And through the concert, he kept returning to somber but determinedly hopeful reflections on war and peace. For ''Qué Pasa?'' from ''Mi Sangre,'' images of wars from Vietnam to Colombia were projected behind him as he sang: ''Why must there be so much war?/Why must there be so much pain?''</p>
        <p>Like U2 in English-speaking rock, Juanes merges romantic love and social compassion, and listeners respond to both. Romance makes him approachable; compassion gives him depth. And his music radiates hope in its climbing chord progressions, its optimistic choruses and its easy command of rock and Latin rhythms. Juanes touches down regularly in cumbia and other Colombian styles, keeping the music rooted while the rhythm lightens some of his most pointed lyrics. Even a song as troubled as ''Fíjate Bien,'' or ''Watch Carefully,'' which warns people to look out for land mines, rode on danceable percussion.</p>
        <p>Socially aware rockers always risk sounding preachy or self-important. But Juanes carries his conscience with grace, melody and irresistible rhythms, and he drew the cheers to prove it.</p>
