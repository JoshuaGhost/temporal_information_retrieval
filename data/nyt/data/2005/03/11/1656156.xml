        <p>As suddenly -- and as oddly -- as it began, the Giants' whirlwind courtship of the free-agent receiver Plaxico Burress is over.</p>
        <p>After an overnight visit that included dinner at a Manhattan steak house and a contract offer that would have made him the deep threat the Giants so desperately need, the team abruptly announced yesterday that it had ended negotiations with Burress's representatives.</p>
        <p>''The New York Giants are no longer interested in free-agent wide receiver Plaxico Burress and have withdrawn their offer,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Accorsi was not available for comment, but according to several people who were briefed on how the talks evolved, the sticking point in the negotiations was that the Giants' offer did not meet Burress's expectations.</p>
        <p>Two other elite receivers who have signed contracts with new teams in recent weeks -- Muhsin Muhammad (Chicago) and Derrick Mason (Baltimore) -- reportedly received signing bonuses of $12 million and $7 million. The Giants' best offer to Burress included a bonus of about $8 million.</p>
        <p>''The numbers just weren't there,'' said a person close to Burress.</p>
        <p>The Giants' statement was designed to ensure that Burress could not use their offer as leverage during visits to other teams, according to those briefed on the negotiations.</p>
        <p>After releasing Ike Hilliard last week, the Giants need an established receiver to stretch defenses and help the development of quarterback Eli Manning, who will begin his first full season as a starter. And the lack of a first-round pick in next month's draft -- surrendered last year in the trade with San Diego to acquire Manning -- increased the Giants' urgency.</p>
        <p>Burress, 27, found himself in the middle of what is suddenly a soft market for receivers. Burress, considered one of the top-tier free agents, has not drawn the interest that might have been expected of a player of his caliber.</p>
        <p>His representatives confirmed this week that although Burress had been in talks with several teams, the trip to Giants Stadium on Wednesday -- contrary to earlier reports -- was his first official visit to a team.</p>
        <p>Burress's value in the market might have been affected by what is considered a strong pool of receivers in the draft. Or he might have found few suitors because of his capricious personality.</p>
        <p>In any event, the Giants' statement brought an end to a visit that began strangely when the receiver's representatives said that he was too sick to fly to New Jersey to visit the team.</p>
        <p>While Burress's representatives said there had been no subtext to the postponement, there was speculation that the move was designed to spur other teams to approach Burress when they learned of his pending visit to the Giants.</p>
        <p>Although it is impossible to know if that was the case, those briefed on the talks said that taken together -- the postponement, other delays and the tenor of the negotiations themselves -- Burress's actions led some within the Giants organization to question the legitimacy of his interest in joining the team.</p>
        <p>Now both sides move on to Plan B. Burress, according to those close to the talks, is headed next to Minnesota, one of a handful of teams that his representatives are said to have had cursory talks with in recent weeks. The Vikings, after trading Randy Moss to Oakland last week, are another team in need of a solid starter at wide receiver.</p>
        <p>The Giants are scheduled today to play host to receiver Corey Bradford, a free agent from the Houston Texans. Although not considered a player of Burress's class, Bradford, 29, does have the speed to stretch defenses and, as a seven-year veteran, has experience and savvy.</p>
        <p>He is also genuinely interested in joining the Giants. ''Sure,'' Bradford's agent, James E. Sexton, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''He wouldn't be coming if he didn't.''</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday whether the Giants envision the 6-foot-1, 201 pound Bradford as a starter; he was often used as a third receiver at the end of the season with Houston.</p>
        <p>''He'll know more when he gets there,'' Sexton said.</p>
