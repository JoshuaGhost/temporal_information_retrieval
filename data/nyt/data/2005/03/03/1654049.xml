        <p>Workers at a Wal-Mart store in Windsor, Ontario, will try to form a union for a second time, union officials said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The United Food and Commercial Workers Canada filed on behalf of the employees with the Ontario labor board Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Andrew Mackenzie, the union representative who led the organizing drive, said Wednesday that the union delayed its application more than two weeks after Wal-Mart said that a unionized store in Jonqui√®re, Quebec, would be closed in May. Workers at that store are in the process of negotiating their first contract.</p>
        <p>Andrew Pelletier, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Canada, said the company would challenge the petition on the ground that the union's definition of the store's bargaining unit was undemocratic. According to Mr. Pelletier, the union wants to exclude 50 hourly workers from the unionization vote. About 200 people work in the store.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie said the 50 were excluded because they all had the word ''manager'' in their titles. In 1997, the Windsor store, which was then in a different location, was organized by the Canadian arm of the United Steelworkers of America.</p>
        <p>After the union and the company failed to negotiate a contract, employees voted to remove the union in 2000.</p>
