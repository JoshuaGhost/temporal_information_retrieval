        <p>When you want to put your violin concerto before the public, it is helpful to have a master violinist to play it, even more helpful if she is your wife. When you want an orchestra to program your music, being music director doesn't hurt, either. There is no sin in the kind of three-way logrolling that went on at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday. New music should do anything it can to find an audience, and this way is better than many.</p>
        <p>The parties were André Previn, Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Oslo Philharmonic. They were in town this week for two concerts. Mr. Previn's three-movement concerto from 2001 was on Wednesday's program: a work refreshingly itself and having little patience with modernistic bitterness and bad temper. The piece's high, wide and handsome style, set off by billowing string sound, proudly advertises the cinematic music on which Mr. Previn cut his compositorial teeth.</p>

        <p>When you want to put your violin concerto before the public, it is helpful to have a master violinist to play it, even more helpful if she is your wife. When you want an orchestra to program your music, being music director doesn't hurt, either. There is no sin in the kind of three-way logrolling that went on at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday. New music should do anything it can to find an audience, and this way is better than many.</p>
        <p>The parties were André Previn, Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Oslo Philharmonic. They were in town this week for two concerts. Mr. Previn's three-movement concerto from 2001 was on Wednesday's program: a work refreshingly itself and having little patience with modernistic bitterness and bad temper. The piece's high, wide and handsome style, set off by billowing string sound, proudly advertises the cinematic music on which Mr. Previn cut his compositorial teeth.</p>
        <p>The orchestration, radiating with color, reflects both a long life of hearing how orchestras work and a love for the gorgeous sound of French and late Romantic composers. Call it Richard Strauss with palm trees. The concerto also makes use of Ms. Mutter's near miraculous control at the higher altitudes of the violin; Mr. Previn's high-energy songfulness prospers in her hands. Elsewhere, he sits us up straight with loose-limbed syncopation, finishing with a touching, sweetly singing tune to send us home.</p>
        <p>Richard Strauss himself was represented after intermission in a splendid performance of the ''Alpine'' Symphony.'' Up and down the mountain we went. Strauss's ability to make us believe in a literal narrative recast in musical terms, sound effects and other tone-painting tricks is extraordinary. There are cowbells in the mountain pasture, swirling mists, frightening thunder and lightning, and much more. The Oslo is a very good orchestra, with a warm, cultured sound and the physical wherewithal to make Strauss's sublime parlor tricks eminently believable.</p>
        <p>These concerts were unusually nonpatriotic: nothing from Norway or even a Scandinavian neighbor. The orchestra seemed to be indulging its music director's longstanding affections. Three pieces on Thursday were by Ravel. In ''Shéhérazade,'' the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, gorgeously gowned and looking terrific, added a touch of quiet vocal luxury to this elusive music. Ravel's second ''Daphnis et Chloé'' Suite had a nice transparency, as Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun'' had had the night before.</p>
        <p>''Alborada del Gracioso,'' also on Thursday, showed the patience of a truly professional conductor: Ravel's flamboyance was never allowed to run away with itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Previn is slow afoot these days, but he still plays the piano well, on Thursday the Gershwin Concerto in F. If the solo part sounded a little remote, circumstances conspired. Pointing the piano nose-in toward the orchestra made conducting easier but dispersed sound in the wrong directions. There was also Mr. Previn's delicate technique and a Bösendorfer piano built more for refinement than brash statement.</p>
