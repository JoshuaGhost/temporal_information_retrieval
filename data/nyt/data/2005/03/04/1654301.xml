        <p>For Video Gamers, E10+</p>
        <p>A new ratings classification for video games has been introduced by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, the regulatory organization established by the Entertainment Software Association in 1994. The new category, E10+, standing for Everyone 10 and older, is intended to enable consumers to differentiate between E-rated games, appropriate for the whole family, and games deemed suitable for ages 10 and up. In a statement, Patricia Vance, president of the rating board, said child-development experts and scholars had been consulted in creating the new category. The statement said that games carrying the E10+ rating might include ''moderate amounts of cartoon, fantasy or mild violence, mild language and minimal suggestive themes.'' Ms. Vance said: ''We expect that many of the best-selling sports, racing and adventure games will continue to receive E ratings appropriate for ages 6 and older. Games with content that may not be suitable for younger ages of 6 to 9, such as racing games with more extreme crashes or fighting games with superheroes, will now receive an E10+ rating.''</p>
        <p>Warehouse of Dramas</p>
        <p>With scripts by the award-winning filmmakers Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, below, and the Oscar-winning Charlie Kaufman, and with actors like Steve Buscemi, Peter Dinklage, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep, live readings of two so-called sound plays in the style of drama in the heyday of radio will be presented from April 28 to 30 at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn. Under the collective title ''Theater of the New Ear,'' the plays -- the Coens' ''Sawbones'' and Mr. Kaufman's ''Hope Leaves the Theater'' -- accompanied by sound effects and by music composed by Carter Burwell and performed by an eight-piece band, will also be seen on May 13 at Royal Festival Hall in London.</p>
        <p>Smits for President</p>
        <p>If a poll is any guide, Jimmy Smits, below, not Alan Alda, will succeed Martin Sheen as president of the United States, at least the United States that is the province of the NBC political drama ''The West Wing,'' The Associated Press reported. Because the second term of the Democratic president Josiah Bartlet, played by Mr. Sheen, is coming to an end, an election is impending. A poll by John Zogby, who often surveys the political leanings of Americans, determined that Mr. Smits, as the Democratic Representative Matt Santos of Texas, holds a 44 percent to 28 percent lead over the Republican Senator Arnold Vinick of California, played by Mr. Alda. ''While he and Santos are tied among men, each getting 35 percent of the vote, Santos leads among women, besting Vinick 53 percent to 22 percent,'' Mr. Zogby said. The poll was conducted from Feb. 18 to 25 and based on responses from 5,505 American adults nationwide who said they watched the show. The sampling error was plus or minus 0.7 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Trouble in Paradise</p>
        <p>Residents of northern Fiji are angry because Mel Gibson has bought Mago Island, The Associated Press reported. They say their ancestors were forced off the land. The sale of that Pacific hideaway to Mr. Gibson by the Tokyu Corporation of Japan for about $15 million was approved by the Fijian cabinet last month, Laisa Raratabu, a Fijian official, said. But some villagers have been raising money to challenge it in court, The Fiji Times reported. ''Our island was sold for 2,000 coconut plants, and stories told by our forefathers are that they were forced to leave at gunpoint,'' Timoci Waqalevu, a tribal member, said.</p>
        <p>Peet Replaces Tomei</p>
        <p>A last-minute change at the Public Theater: Amanda Peet, the increasingly busy film gamin, will replace Marisa Tomei in the cast of ''This Is How it Goes,'' a new drama by Neil LaBute about an interracial love triangle in a Southern town. Ms. Tomei is leaving the cast, which also includes Ben Stiller and Jeffrey Wright, because of an illness in her family. Ms. Peet will start rehearsals today, six days before previews begin. The opening is planned for March 27.</p>
