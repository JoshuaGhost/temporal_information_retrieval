        <p>Matthew Hale, the white supremacist convicted last year of plotting to kill a federal judge, sent a statement through his mother on Thursday condemning the murder of the judge's husband and mother as a ''heinous crime'' that he had nothing to do with.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale's mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said her son also told her, in their weekly 15-minute telephone call, that he was moved to a different cell after the slayings were discovered on Monday and that F.B.I. agents had visited the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to question him and nearby prisoners.</p>

        <p>Matthew Hale, the white supremacist convicted last year of plotting to kill a federal judge, sent a statement through his mother on Thursday condemning the murder of the judge's husband and mother as a ''heinous crime'' that he had nothing to do with.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale's mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said her son also told her, in their weekly 15-minute telephone call, that he was moved to a different cell after the slayings were discovered on Monday and that F.B.I. agents had visited the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago to question him and nearby prisoners.</p>
        <p>''There's simply no way that any supporter of mine would commit such a heinous crime,'' Ms. Hutcheson read from the statement, which she said Mr. Hale had written before calling his parents around 8:45 a.m. ''I totally condemn it, and I want the perpetrator caught and prosecuted.</p>
        <p>''I only hope they seriously want to apprehend the animal instead of railroading the innocent,'' his statement continued. ''Only an idiot would think I would do this. My sentencing date is April 6.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale, 33, faces up to 40 years in prison for two counts of obstruction of justice and one of soliciting his security chief to assassinate Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow of the United States District Court. Judge Lefkow had ordered him in 2002 to pay $200,000 for violating an Oregon group's trademark on the name World Church of the Creator. He is representing himself and is being held under special measures, reserved for terrorists, that restrict his contact with the outside world, allowing only his parents to visit him, each for an hour, every other week.</p>
        <p>''He sounded sad, he's worried, frantic, scared -- so many things,'' Ms. Hutcheson said, adding that Mr. Hale has no television but was monitoring news of the killings through radio. ''They've taken him out of his cell where he is working his case. All of his books and papers have been taken away from him after this.'' She said Mr. Hale had told her the F.B.I. ''had been questioning everybody that was on the floor he was on, the other inmates.'' She added, ''a couple of them, he said, they really interrogated them for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Judge Lefkow found her husband, Michael F. Lefkow, 64, and her mother, Donna Humphrey, 89, shot to death in their basement when she returned home from work on Monday.</p>
        <p>Two members of Congress called on Thursday for increased financing to protect federal judges and their families. Judge Lefkow had an extra security detail during Mr. Hale's trial last year, but it was disbanded after a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>''This is an urgent homeland security matter,'' Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat whose district includes part of Chicago, wrote in a letter to President Bush, saying the $485.9 million allotted for judicial protection in his proposed budget was insufficient. ''Federal judges all over the country are in need of protection from terrorism, both foreign and domestic.''</p>
        <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who nominated Judge Lefkow in 2000, said in a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, ''These cruel and cold-blooded killings are attacks not only on two innocent individuals, but on our criminal justice system as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Durbin did not make a specific request, but asked Mr. Gonzales to identify steps to improve safety, including emergency funds for the United States Marshals Service and money to set up security systems at judges' homes.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the marshals service, Dave Sacks, said it would be impossible to put round-the-clock security on the nation's 2,000 federal judges in 400 court facilities. He said as far as he knew, Monday's killings were the first of a judge's relatives, though three judges have been slain in the last 216 years. Mr. Sacks said that federal judges received about 600 security threats a year and that the marshals provided added security, like 24-hour guards, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>''You can never know when is enough and when to back off,'' Mr. Sacks said. ''I'm not going to say that something like this happened because we're underfunded.''</p>
