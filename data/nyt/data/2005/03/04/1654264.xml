      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Colombian rocker Juanes, shortened from Juan Esteban Aristizabal, sings about love and war, particularly the civil war that has torn Colombia apart. Amid the violence, Colombia has somehow generated extraordinary music, not only from Juanes but from musicians and bands as determinedly upbeat and proud of their country as Shakira, Carlos Vives, Cabas and Aterciopelados. Juanes, above, has not courted a North American audience by writing songs in English, but he's headlining at Madison Square Garden tonight anyway. He has become one of Latin America's superstars, with nine Latin Grammys among his many awards, and his popularity stems from something more than his good looks and his tunes, which draw easily on anything from Colombian cumbia to funk, new wave rock to bossa nova, reggae to waltz. He touches down in local music, then looks outward. For listeners across Latin America and Spanish speakers elsewhere, what comes across in Juanes's songs is an intense longing that spans romance, love of country and the yearning for peace. In ''Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor'' (''Nothing Matters Without Your Love''), a declaration of love that has been a hit in Colombia since last summer, he sings, ''I want to take back all the nights I lost, to conquer this overwhelming fear of death.'' For all his earnestness, Juanes never despairs. His songs are not complaints; they insist on hope. Straightforward love songs and songs like ''Sueños,'' (''Dreams'') in which Juanes imagines ''an end to this unjust war'' and ''walking the streets of my country and finding only peace,'' reinforce one another's seriousness and determined optimism, rallied by music that makes its way toward buoyant choruses. The songs envision the possibility of happy endings even if, for the moment, they seem far away. (Tonight at 8, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741.; tickets are $45 to $75.)</p>
