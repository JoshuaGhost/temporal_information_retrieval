        <p>As is customary with veterans of a certain stature, Mike Piazza rates two locker stalls in the Mets' clubhouse. On the low shelf in his storage stall Thursday, alongside three weathered catcher's mitts, rested a fresh new first baseman's glove, wrapped tightly with white twine to hold a baseball -- the time-honored way to break it in.</p>
        <p>One year after his unsuccessful switch to first base, Piazza has told the Mets' new manager, Willie Randolph, that he was willing to play there occasionally if needed. Piazza said he had taken a few grounders on back fields already so he would not be caught unprepared.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to shelve it,'' Piazza said. ''I enjoyed the experience. I don't know if I'll ever be a full-time first baseman in the future, but I wouldn't mind keeping the bag, so to speak.</p>
        <p>''This game is funny sometimes. I at least want to give them an option. It may not be the best option, but it's an option.''</p>
        <p>Randolph said he and Piazza had talked about it.</p>
        <p>''It probably won't happen often, but in a pinch,'' Randolph said, adding of Piazza: ''He said, 'I'll help any way I can.' That's what leaders do.''</p>
        <p>For now, though, Piazza is strictly a catcher hoping to regain his health and his hitting stroke.</p>
        <p>Until the spring home opener against the St. Louis Cardinals was rained out Thursday night, Piazza was scheduled to catch and bat cleanup between Carlos Beltran and Cliff Floyd.</p>
        <p>Tests for Heredia's Numb Hand</p>
        <p>Felix Heredia returned to New York for tests after losing feeling in his left hand Wednesday while pitching against the Washington Nationals. ''His hand just got numb and cold,'' General Manager Omar Minaya said.</p>
        <p>Heredia will be examined at the Hospital for Special Surgery. ''I don't think it's serious, but we don't have all the answers,'' Minaya said.</p>
        <p>Martínez Is Still the Starter</p>
        <p>The rainout did not change the Mets' pitching plans. Kris Benson and the three relievers scheduled to work Thursday night threw simulated innings in batting cages. Pedro Martínez remains the starter Friday in Jupiter against St. Louis.</p>
