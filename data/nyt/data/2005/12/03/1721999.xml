        <p>The United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to an American request to discuss human rights in Myanmar, where the military junta has just extended the house arrest of the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, left. The agreement fell short of placing the issue on the Council's formal agenda for follow-up action, but it called for a closed-door briefing of the 15 members arranged by Secretary General Kofi Annan. The move followed a report from an Asian human rights group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, accusing the Burmese military of ''brutal and systematic'' abuse and torture of political prisoners.</p>
