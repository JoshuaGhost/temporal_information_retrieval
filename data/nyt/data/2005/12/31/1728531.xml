        <p>THE Consumerist (consumerist.com), the newest blog in the expanding Gawker Media empire, displays a healthy antipathy toward everything it thinks is wrong with the retail and service sectors.</p>
        <p>It operates on the idea that since we are stuck with a business culture that is increasingly hostile toward consumers, we should make the best of it.</p>
        <p>''Shoppers bite back'' is the site's slogan, and so they do. Joel Johnson, the site's proprietor, posts e-mail messages from readers complaining about things like service at a local United Parcel Service store or a frustration-fraught experience with AirTran Airways that ended in an unreasonably small airplane restroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, who previously edited Gizmodo, another Gawker site, also highlights consumer-oriented news nuggets, funny pictures and shopping tips -- all with the same snarky tone that characterizes Gawker properties like Wonkette and Defamer.</p>
        <p>This week, he posted an impassioned plea for more imaginative advertising because ''the loud, braying ubiquity of advertising pretty much invalidates it without any effort on my part.'' He added, ''I don't notice advertising anymore, unless it is advertising that somehow makes my life a little more surreal, or stupid, or silly, or magical.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with the online Gelf Magazine (gelfmagazine.com), Mr. Johnson acknowledged his anti-corporate bias (it is, in fact, the blog's raison d'Ãªtre), going so far as to admit, ''I probably have more Marxist in me than most Americans.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''I still enjoy the little brain buzz I get from buying new things, even if I am cognizant of their ephemeral nature.''</p>
        <p>''It's O.K. to like capitalism, even the selfish parts, but we just shouldn't be so drunk on it.''</p>
        <p>But there is no worse way to kill the buzz than dealing with a company with an antagonistic attitude toward its customers or an incompetent service staff. Mr. Johnson is circumspect, however. ''I'm more interested in encouraging companies to come correct than fruitlessly, if humorously, whaling on them. But sometimes an angry pejorative is all you've got.''</p>
        <p>THE ART OF THE PLEA DEAL -- The Corporate Crime Reporter (corporatecrimereporter.com), a newsletter that costs $795 a year but that offers a fair amount of free Web content, published a report this week about the growing prevalence of federal and state prosecutors' offering major corporations special deals called deferred prosecution or nonprosecution agreements.</p>
        <p>Most often, the deals are offered in exchange for cooperation on prosecuting corporate officers. But Corporate Crime Reporter says they ''were originally intended for minor drug cases and juvenile delinquency cases.''</p>
        <p>Beneficiaries have included Adelphia, Computer Associates, KPMG, Merrill Lynch, Monsanto, Sears, Royal Duth Shell and WorldCom/MCI.</p>
        <p>The report examines 34 such agreements that have been reached since 2003, which the newsletter says ''relieve large U.S. corporations of their criminal liability in major bribery and fraud cases'' even when prosecutors are ''confronted with solid evidence of corporate criminal wrongdoing.''</p>
        <p>CLAIM THAT TUNE -- The Columbia Law Library Music Plagiarism Project (ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/law/library/introduction.html) features audio samples that compare songs that were involved in landmark copyright cases. Users can compare, for example, Gilbert O'Sullivan's ''Alone Again (Naturally)'' with ''Alone Again'' by the rapper Biz Markie, which sampled the original and lifted the lyrics.</p>
        <p>The site includes court decisions and commentary on them from the site's authors. The judge in the ''Alone Again'' case, the site says, missed the fact that ''apart from the gibberish chanted over O'Sullivan's ostinato, there is nothing original in Biz Markie's song or his recording except his performance of it.''</p>
        <p>Other songs featured on the site include ''Don't Fence Me In,'' ''Feelings'' and John Lee Hooker's ''Boogie Chillun.''' For some mysterious reason, the sound files are all encoded in the RealPlayer format.</p>
