        <p>In ''Trade, Oppression, Revenge'' (column, Dec. 25), David Brooks discusses the inability of the poor in Bolivia and other Latin American countries to prosper in a capitalist society. Aren't we seeing the same phenomenon develop in America?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Trade, Oppression, Revenge'' (column, Dec. 25), David Brooks discusses the inability of the poor in Bolivia and other Latin American countries to prosper in a capitalist society. Aren't we seeing the same phenomenon develop in America?</p>
        <p>The following contribute to a climate that could gradually lead to the loss of equal opportunity here: the cuts in the estate tax, which encourage formation of an ''aristocracy of the wealthy''; other tax cuts that go mainly to the rich; the development of huge conglomerates with less competition; fabulous salaries and bonuses for chief executives; lobbying and political donations by the rich that ''buy off'' elected officials; cuts to education, Medicaid and Medicare; and fewer differences between the political parties.</p>
        <p>It grows harder for anyone with a good idea to start a business, and harder for working people to make a decent living. America is looking more and more like the stratified societies described in Mr. Brooks's column.</p>
