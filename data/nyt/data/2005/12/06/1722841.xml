        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Hunting is as natural as bird-watching'' is how Nicholas D. Kristof absurdly concludes his justification for controlling deer population by hunting, both in the name of environmentalism, as well as a way to connect people with nature.</p>
        <p>Recreational hunting, which prefers the killing of bucks, does little to control overall deer population. Deer will quickly adjust to such hunting by more births as competition for food and habitat is reduced.</p>

        <p>Killing and maiming wildlife is a strange and twisted way to ''appreciate'' nature. To suggest otherwise defies common sense and basic humane values.</p>
