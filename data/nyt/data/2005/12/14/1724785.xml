        <p>Stones on the Beach in Rio</p>
        <p>The Rolling Stones plan a free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro in February, organizers said yesterday, and as many as 1.5 million people are expected to attend, Reuters reported. ''City Hall considers this show to be like another New Year,'' said Ana Maria Maia, a municipal official for special events. Officials said that more than 2,400 police officers would be on duty in three shifts for the show on Feb. 18, and that streets in the area would be sealed off. Rio is plagued by violent crime that often spills out of the slums, where drug gangs rule. The Stones -- Mick Jagger, above, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ron Wood -- are now in the United States on their Bigger Bang tour.</p>
        <p>Comic's Web Site Is Pulled</p>
        <p>The British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, below, and Kazakhstan are at it again. In their latest skirmish, Reuters reported, Kazakhstan has pulled the plug on the Web site of Borat Sagdiyev, the boorish, sexist, racist Kazakh television reporter who is Mr. Cohen's alter ego. Last month, the foreign ministry threatened ''legal action'' against Mr. Cohen, known for his portrayal of Borat on ''Da Ali G. Show.'' Mr. Cohen, who is Jewish, used the Web site, www.borat.kz, to respond. Yesterday, the government-appointed organization that regulates Web sites ending in the .kz domain name for Kazakhstan confirmed that Mr. Cohen's site had been suspended. Nurlan Isin, president of the Association of Kazakh IT Companies, said: ''We've done this so he can't badmouth Kazakhstan under the .kz domain name. He can go and do whatever he wants at other domains.''</p>
        <p>James Dean Museum Will Close Soon</p>
        <p>The James Dean museum in Gas City, Ind., will close on Dec. 31, The Associated Press reported. ''The operating expenses and upkeep and payments are just more than we can handle,'' said David Loehr, the owner. He moved the James Dean Gallery two years ago to Gas City from Fairmount, Ind., where Dean, the star of films including ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' ''Giant'' and ''East of Eden,'' attended high school. Dean was 24 when he died in a car crash in Cholame, Calif., in 1955. Mr. Loehr, who opened the museum and gift shop in 1988, said he planned to store his collection, including a dozen pieces of wardrobe worn in Dean's major films, as well as school papers, paintings, posters, books and magazines.</p>
        <p>Colin Farrell in Treatment</p>
        <p>Colin Farrell, top right, the star of ''Alexander'' and ''Phone Booth,'' is under treatment for exhaustion and dependency on prescription medication, The Associated Press reported. Danica Smith, a spokeswoman for the 29-year-old Irish actor, right, said in a written statement that the medication was prescribed after he suffered a back injury. She did not say where he was receiving treatment, but the statement said he had checked himself in.</p>
        <p>Young Buck Sentenced</p>
        <p>The rapper Young Buck has been sentenced to three years' probation and 80 hours of community service after pleading no contest to an assault charge stemming from a stabbing at the Vibe Awards show last year in Santa Monica, Calif., The Associated Press reported. Young Buck, 24, whose real name is David Darnell Brown, entered the plea to a charge of assault likely to produce great bodily harm. He was accused of stabbing Jimmy James Johnson, 27, who attended the show, after Mr. Johnson punched the producer Dr. Dre. Mr. Johnson pleaded guilty in September to felony assault and was sentenced to a year in jail and placed on probation for three years. Young Buck, signed to Dr. Dre's label as a member of 50 Cent's G-Unit rap crew, is also due in court next month in New York, where he pleaded not guilty to felony gun possession after he and Lloyd Banks, another member of G-Unit, were arrested in a van after performing at Madison Square Garden on the Anger Management tour.</p>
        <p>Time Out at 'Daily Show'</p>
        <p>Fans of ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' got a rerun instead of the planned original episode on Monday night, said Tony Fox, executive vice president of corporate communications for Comedy Central. Production was suspended after the staff learned that Bill Clarey, 25, a receptionist for the show in New York, had committed suicide over the weekend. Mr. Fox said normal production resumed yesterday.</p>
