        <p>After several days of serious accusations about the validity of a prominent article on the cloning of human cells, the senior author, Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh, has asked for his name to be removed as co-author, the editors of the journal Science said yesterday.</p>

        <p>After several days of serious accusations about the validity of a prominent article on the cloning of human cells, the senior author, Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh, has asked for his name to be removed as co-author, the editors of the journal Science said yesterday.</p>
        <p>They also said they were refusing the request because authors could not withdraw their names unilaterally and Dr. Schatten's Korean co-authors, who did all the experiments, had not yet agreed to retract the article.</p>
        <p>The lead Korean author is Hwang Woo Suk, a veterinary researcher at Seoul National University who came to sudden prominence with several striking successes in the cloning field in the last two years. In February 2004 Dr. Hwang reported in Science online that he had established a line of human embryonic stem cells by transferring the nucleus of adult cells to a human egg whose own nucleus had been removed. In June 2005 he said he had done the same procedure with 11 patients, using far fewer human eggs.</p>
        <p>The report was hailed as the first step toward the goal of treating people with their own tissues, generated through embryonic cells.</p>
        <p>For reasons that are unclear, Dr. Hwang invited Dr. Schatten to be the senior co-author of the article, and he accepted. But last month Dr. Schatten severed his collaboration with Dr. Hwang over the way human eggs were procured for the experiment and placed a correction in Science saying that his only role in the paper had been to analyze data and prepare the paper for publication.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the paper has come under increasing criticism from Korean scientists. Their accusations, posted anonymously on Korean Web sites, first showed that some of the photographs of the 11 cell colonies were duplicates. Science acknowledged that the accusation was correct but said the duplication occurred when originals were replaced with photographs of higher resolution.</p>
        <p>The critics then showed that several of the photographs overlapped, even though they were supposed to be of different cell colonies. Indeed, they said it seemed that as few as two cell colonies had been used to generate photographs.</p>
        <p>The critics also noticed a strange feature in the DNA fingerprints taken of the cell colonies and the donors from whom they were supposedly derived. In several cases the pairs of fingerprints seemed to be identical, lacking any of the subtle differences expected in two independent tests.</p>
        <p>If this were true, critics say, the paper would not have any evidence that the cell colonies came from the donors or that Dr. Hwang ever performed any successful nuclear transfer experiments.</p>
        <p>Eight leaders in cloning technology, including Dr. Ian Wilmut of Edinburgh University, John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins and Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology, have written to Science saying that they encouraged Dr. Hwang ''to cooperate with us to perform an independent test of his cell lines'' to see if they matched the donors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schatten's confidence in Dr. Hwang's results has also been shaken. In his letter to Science, released yesterday by the University of Pittsburgh, he said he wished to retract his co-authorship of the June 17 article because ''my careful re-evaluations of published figures and tables, along with new problematic information, now casts substantial doubts about the paper's accuracy.''</p>
        <p>He also said that over the weekend he had ''received allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated.''</p>
        <p>The individual was not named, and Dr. Schatten was unavailable for comment yesterday, but Korean press accounts have quoted Kim Sun Jong, a member of Dr. Hwang's laboratory who now works at the University of Pittsburgh, as saying in an interview with MBC-TV in South Korea on the program ''PD Diary'' that he was told by Dr. Hwang to make 11 or so cell lines out of the two or three he had in his possession.</p>
        <p>The promise of Dr. Hwang's Science paper is that it seemed to make the long-sought goal of therapeutic cloning quite practical by using only 10 or so human eggs per patient, compared with the 242 used in his 2004 experiment. If the article should turn out to have been fabricated, it would ''give a black eye to science in general,'' Dr. Gearhart said.</p>
