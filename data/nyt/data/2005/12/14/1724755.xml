        <p>Explosions of artillery rattle the walls at the opening and the close of ''The Other Side,'' the new play by Ariel Dorfman that opened last night on City Center's Stage I, courtesy of Manhattan Theater Club. Violent warfare is roiling the countryside where an old couple, played by the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum, toil in solitude, burying the dead and awaiting the balm of a long-promised peace.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not much theatrical firepower is expended during the hour and change between those nerve-jangling aural assaults. In ''The Other Side,'' Mr. Dorfman has set out to denounce the cruelty of global feuds fired by nationalism and ethnic prejudice.</p>
        <p>But he has expressed this unexceptionable sentiment in the form of a ponderous comedy-drama that could itself be accused of a human-rights violation, albeit a minor one: the wholesale waste of two first-rate actors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorfman, the Chilean-American playwright, poet and novelist, is best known for ''Death and the Maiden,'' the suspense drama set in a vaguely defined South American country in recovery from the depredations of a brutal dictatorship. A highbrow hot ticket on Broadway in the early 90's, thanks to the seductively starry cast of Richard Dreyfuss, Glenn Close and Gene Hackman, it was later filmed by Roman Polanski with Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver.</p>
        <p>''The Other Side,'' directed a little tentatively by Blanka Zizka, is set in similarly blurred but familiar terrain, a strip of land near the border dividing two countries engaged in a protracted war. The brutal recent history of the Balkans was obviously the inspiration, but Mr. Dorfman's play also has pointed applications to the latest developments in the seemingly endless Palestinian-Israeli stalemate.</p>
        <p>As the play opens, Atom Roma (Mr. Cullum) and Levana Julak (Ms. Harris) are seen puttering around their squalid but neatly kept house, rendered in admirably precise if unnecessary detail by the designer Beowulf Boritt. Their shack is just inside the border of Tomis, Atom's homeland, which has been at war for two decades with the neighboring Constanza, where Levana was born.</p>
        <p>Atom and Levana scrape a living by burying the anonymous victims of the war from both sides, hoping for the return of peace and of their son, who disappeared into the maw of war many years ago and hasn't been heard from since.</p>
        <p>For Atom, hope has ebbed away, leaving a puddle of mordant cynicism. Snapping off the radio, he mutters, ''An important announcement: peace will be here tomorrow. Electricity will be here tomorrow. Tune in tomorrow. Meanwhile, keep fighting.'' Levana carefully nurtures a few green shoots of optimism. ''It has to end sometime,'' she says. Atom retorts, ''Why's that?''</p>
        <p>Levana is ultimately proved right when another crackle from the radio brings reprieve: tomorrow has arrived, peace is here. But so, too, is the mad bureaucracy of the armistice, blind to the human cost of political policy. As Atom and Levana contemplate the possibility of a happier future, the back wall of their house explodes to reveal a goggled guard in military uniform, energetically redrawing the officially decreed border between the two countries. It happens to run right through Atom and Levana's double bed, which he soon bifurcates with a coil of barbed wire. Atom is ordered to stay on his side of the room, Levana on hers. Oh, the irony!</p>
        <p>The guard, played with tireless exuberance by Gene Farber, turns out to be something of a standup absurdist, as Mr. Dorfman laboriously embroiders on his cosmic joke. Ordering Levana to her side of the divide, the guard stops her at the new ''border'': ''Wait! Have you anything to declare? Did you buy anything while in Tomis? No liquor? No cigarettes? No agricultural products? You haven't visited a farm? Acquired a firearm?'' Atom and Levana, 30 years married, will now need visas to visit each other and to perform essential daily tasks -- cooking, going to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorfman's lumbering gag has gone stale long before he introduces another wrinkle into the proceedings, when Levana announces that she believes the guard is in fact the couple's long-lost son, an idea met with skepticism by Atom and dismissed by the guard himself, who insists he comes from elsewhere and buried his parents long ago. This device seems to be borrowed from ''Death and the Maiden,'' which also turned on an is-he-or-isn't-he question, for purposes of symbolism and suspense. It doesn't supply much of either here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorfman also borrows freely from several dramatic styles -- Pinteresque obliqueness, the absurdity of Ionesco, the bleak lyricism of Beckett -- without establishing a singular or consistent voice. The performers must do what they can to supplement the hollow writing with human specifics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harris brings a surge of anguished conviction to a poetic litany in which Levana mourns the blank future: ''We'll feed off the dead. We'll sell the dead. One by one. The only thing this place produces. We'll trade the dead, we'll buy milk with the dead, we'll warm ourselves with the coal of the dead.'' But there is more dutiful professionalism than passion in her performance, and in Mr. Cullum's spry turn as the pessimistic Atom.</p>
        <p>Writing for characters who are meant to stand for all of Suffering Humanity, Mr. Dorfman has come up with a kind of generic theatrical Esperanto that challenges even the formidable talents of these wonderful actors.</p>
