        <p>Ice, Ice Baby: Urban Twists On an Old-Fashioned Tale</p>
        <p>''Every story lives in the past, the present and the future, all at the same time.'' This observation, made by a character in Stanton Wood's adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen tale ''The Snow Queen,'' also applies to the production. Featuring samba rhythms, urban raps, a cross-dressing reindeer and hip-hop-embracing adolescents, this magical ''Snow Queen'' manages to be both undeniably New York and authentically Andersen.</p>
        <p>Presented by Urban Stages, the show retains the core of the original story: Gerda, the heroine, embarks on a selfless quest to find her friend Kay, whose vision is warped when a sliver of the Snow Queen's broken mirror flies into his eye. Turning cold and hostile, he eventually vanishes. But because this is modern Manhattan, Gerda (Susan Heyward) at first responds by spraying the neighborhood with graffiti about her missing friend. When she follows the advice of her grandmother (Ned Massey), she first ends up on the shores of Brazil. A goddess there insists that her grandmother must be a witch, and Gerda replies: ''No. She's a cashier at Macy's.''</p>

        <p>Ice, Ice Baby: Urban Twists On an Old-Fashioned Tale</p>
        <p>''Every story lives in the past, the present and the future, all at the same time.'' This observation, made by a character in Stanton Wood's adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen tale ''The Snow Queen,'' also applies to the production. Featuring samba rhythms, urban raps, a cross-dressing reindeer and hip-hop-embracing adolescents, this magical ''Snow Queen'' manages to be both undeniably New York and authentically Andersen.</p>
        <p>Presented by Urban Stages, the show retains the core of the original story: Gerda, the heroine, embarks on a selfless quest to find her friend Kay, whose vision is warped when a sliver of the Snow Queen's broken mirror flies into his eye. Turning cold and hostile, he eventually vanishes. But because this is modern Manhattan, Gerda (Susan Heyward) at first responds by spraying the neighborhood with graffiti about her missing friend. When she follows the advice of her grandmother (Ned Massey), she first ends up on the shores of Brazil. A goddess there insists that her grandmother must be a witch, and Gerda replies: ''No. She's a cashier at Macy's.''</p>
        <p>It's to Mr. Wood's credit that the contemporary humor never diminishes the tale's tenderness. He has increased the story's resonance by giving Kay (Utkarsh S. Ambudkar) a concrete reason for his misery (his parents' arguing) and by making the Snow Queen (Lanna Joffrey) a bereaved mother who is less a fairy-tale villain than a haunting symbol of the dangers of grief turned inward.</p>
        <p>Directed by Daniella Topol, the production includes ingenious puppets by Eric Wright and ethereal backdrops by Mikiko Suzuki. Children over 5 will enjoy Gerda's icy journey, an odyssey that is ultimately all the warmer for having begun so close to their own homes.</p>
        <p>''The Snow Queen,'' through Jan. 15 at Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan. Today at 2 and 7 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 p.m. Full schedule: urbanstages.org. Tickets: $30; Smarttix, (212) 868-4444.</p>
        <p>Staten Island as British Isle</p>
        <p>Although Charles Dickens visited both Manhattan and Brooklyn, accounts of his American travels do not indicate that he ever set foot on Staten Island. But that lapse is being corrected now at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, where Dickens is everywhere. The center's first Dickens Festival features not only performances and workshops about the author but also a genuine Mr. Dickens.</p>
        <p>He is Gerald Charles Dickens, the author's great-great-grandson. Mr. Dickens, who impersonates his famous ancestor, presents one-man shows based on Dickens's work. Today at 2, he will offer ''Mr. Dickens Is Coming!,'' and tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., ''Republic of My Imagination,'' inspired by Dickens's first American visit. Most dramatic, perhaps, will be ''Sikes and Nancy,'' tomorrow at 1.</p>
        <p>''Dickens would re-enact the deaths of Nancy and Sikes from 'Oliver Twist,' '' explained Christopher Catt, the center's director of performing arts, referring to the good-hearted young woman who befriends Oliver and the thuggish boyfriend who kills her.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow at 2 p.m., fans of ''Oliver Twist'' can also enjoy ''Oliver!,'' a concert production of the musical, featuring a chorus of 18 children as Fagin's ragamuffins. ''We took a lot of material from the book and used it for narration,'' Mr. Catt said.</p>
        <p>The festival's other highlights include the Dombey and Son Traveling Circus (tonight at 7); children's shows and workshops by the Mock Turtle Marionette Theater; the Crummles Stage Company, named after the players in ''Nicholas Nickleby''; and Victorian shops and pubs.</p>
        <p>''It's different than other festivals, which quite frequently are in a town with tours of Victorian homes,'' Mr. Catt said. ''Ours is a lot of performing arts, and it's all indoors.'' That will be very welcome if nature also recreates London weather.</p>
        <p>Dickens Festival, today, noon to 9 p.m., and tomorrow, noon to 7 p.m., at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston; (718) 815-7684 or snug-harbor.org. Admission: $10; students, 65+ and members, $8. Circus tickets ($5) and ''Oliver!'' tickets ($7) are additional.</p>
        <p>The Cultures of Kwanzaa</p>
        <p>Kwanzaa is an African-American festival, but to the American Museum of Natural History, it isn't just African and American; it's also Caribbean and American Indian.</p>
        <p>That's because the story of black America winds through several cultures, and the museum's Kwanzaa festivities, which began yesterday and end tomorrow, visit them with games, performances and art workshops. Today at 1:15 p.m., for instance, visitors can explore the roots of jazz dance and music with Clyde Wilder and Ayanna Perrin.</p>
        <p>''The aerial lindy hop is an extension of African dance, as is the Charleston,'' said Elaine Charnov, the museum's director of public programs/education. And at 3:30, performers will present ''Oriki Omi Oddara (Homage to the Clear Water),'' which links Cuban music to African folklore traditions.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's programs include demonstrations by the Indoda Entsha Percussion Ensemble; a show by the Asase Yaa Dance Theater, which uses West African traditions to create ballets; and a presentation of Cherokee folktales by Taalibah Reape, known as Blue Sky. ''It shows the extension of the African-American culture into Native American,'' Ms. Charnov said.</p>
        <p>Families can also bring their own traditions to the mix. Today, children over 8 are invited to arrive with photocopies of a meaningful image to use in collage workshops.</p>
        <p>Kwanzaa celebration, today and tomorrow from 1 to 5 p.m. at the American Museum of Natural History, 79th Street and Central Park West; (212) 769-5315. Free with suggested admission: $14; students and 65+, $10.50; children, $8.</p>
