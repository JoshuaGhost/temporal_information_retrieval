        <p>Big Mac lovers in Hong Kong beware: an antiglobalization protester best known for attacking McDonald's restaurants in France has been permitted into the territory and has even been granted a security pass to the World Trade Organization conference that starts here on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>José Bové, who served six weeks in prison in 2002 for his first attack on a McDonald's three years earlier, was detained by immigration officials at Hong Kong's airport upon arrival Monday afternoon.

        <p>Big Mac lovers in Hong Kong beware: an antiglobalization protester best known for attacking McDonald's restaurants in France has been permitted into the territory and has even been granted a security pass to the World Trade Organization conference that starts here on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>José Bové, who served six weeks in prison in 2002 for his first attack on a McDonald's three years earlier, was detained by immigration officials at Hong Kong's airport upon arrival Monday afternoon. The government here is trying to exclude protesters with histories of violence during the trade talks, scheduled to end Sunday.</p>
        <p>From detention, Mr. Bové phoned a national radio call-in show in France on which Pascal Lamy, the W.T.O.'s director general and a fellow Frenchman, was being interviewed. Mr. Bové was connected with Mr. Lamy, who is also in Hong Kong, and complained about the openness of the W.T.O. process when he could not get past the airport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamy immediately contacted Hong Kong officials, who released Mr. Bové. A French official said the French consulate also helped after the intervention of Mr. Lamy, a former French treasury official.</p>
        <p>Keith Rockwell, the W.T.O.'s chief spokesman, said Mr. Bové had been granted passes as a nongovernmental organization representative to each W.T.O. ministerial conference since at least the Seattle conference in 1999, and had been invited to this week's event.</p>
        <p>Paula Stern, a former chairwoman of the United States International Trade Commission who is here to observe the talks, said Mr. Lamy, who assumed his current job on Sept. 1, showed political adroitness in rescuing Mr. Bové from detention.</p>
        <p>And having Mr. Bové in town is not likely to make the job of the Hong Kong police much tougher. With thousands of protesters already converging here from around the world, Ms. Stern said, ''They have so many headaches already.''</p>
