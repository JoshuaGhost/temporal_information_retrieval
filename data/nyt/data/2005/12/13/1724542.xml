        <p>''Seoul Train,'' a documentary tonight on PBS, is the work of amateurs -- as its creators, Lisa Sleeth and Jim Butterworth, concede. They made the film having never so much as used a camera before, solely on the strength of their concern for the predicament of North Korean refugees.</p>
        <p>It's an earnest and enterprising project, if not a brilliant documentary. Ms. Sleeth and Mr. Butterworth managed to acquire film shot by refugees and activists of the Asian Underground Railroad, some of whom escaped North Korea, where defection is a capital crime, only to re-enter that desperate, dangerous country and document conditions there. These sequences -- images of what Human Rights Watch has called ''the world's largest prison camp'' -- are what make the film: they show improvised encampments of children scrabbling for food, far from the absurdist pageantry of Kim Jong Il.</p>

        <p>''Seoul Train,'' a documentary tonight on PBS, is the work of amateurs -- as its creators, Lisa Sleeth and Jim Butterworth, concede. They made the film having never so much as used a camera before, solely on the strength of their concern for the predicament of North Korean refugees.</p>
        <p>It's an earnest and enterprising project, if not a brilliant documentary. Ms. Sleeth and Mr. Butterworth managed to acquire film shot by refugees and activists of the Asian Underground Railroad, some of whom escaped North Korea, where defection is a capital crime, only to re-enter that desperate, dangerous country and document conditions there. These sequences -- images of what Human Rights Watch has called ''the world's largest prison camp'' -- are what make the film: they show improvised encampments of children scrabbling for food, far from the absurdist pageantry of Kim Jong Il.</p>
        <p>Similarly absorbing is film shot with smuggled cameras during harrowing escape attempts. Many of the images are, perforce, of the floor, the ground and people's feet. The fearsomeness of the undertaking is visible in every odd angle. (In a horror movie, this might be called the ''Blair Witch'' effect, with its suggestion of trembling, concealed cameras, limited eye contact and obstructed views.)</p>
        <p>In one attempt, the refugees, led by a handsome hero of the Underground Railroad called Chun Ki-won, make it to a safe house in Yanji, China; they also give interviews to the camera. They appear to be taking a breath before their next sprint -- one would hope to Mongolia, where the authorities are less apt than the Chinese to return them to North Korea. A 17-year-old girl is shown calling her grandmother in South Korea, promising to see her soon. The others talk about their religious faith. ''I can't feel good or bad,'' one woman says. ''Everything now is up to God.''</p>
        <p>Another family, including a 2-year-old girl named Han-mi, plans to dart through the gates of the Japanese Consulate in Shenyang, China, and ask for asylum. They are thwarted in a horrible scene: Han-mi watches as her mother is pushed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Less interesting material rounds out ''Seoul Train,'' including interviews with concerned talking heads who contribute little but more concern. There is some shifting of blame: from the North Korean government to the Chinese authorities who send refugees back; and then from the Chinese to the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, which, some maintain, has not attended closely enough to the North Koreans at the border.</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, appears as a prophet here, saying: ''We're going to look back in 10 years after North Korea opens up. We're going to see millions of people dead. And we're going say: 'Why didn't you act? Why didn't you do something?' ''</p>
        <p>Some of the efforts to add gloss to the film's rough reportage plainly detract from it. The film's title, ''Seoul Train,'' is a pointless pun, someone's bad idea. An opening sequence locating North Korea on the planet earth seems designed for a junior-high audience. And the haunted, superproduced music of Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke on the soundtrack here is beautiful but too familiar. Surely there is other music -- or perhaps just the rough sound of whispers and the awkward manipulation of a clandestine camera -- that can communicate paranoia, secrecy and half-stifled hope.</p>
