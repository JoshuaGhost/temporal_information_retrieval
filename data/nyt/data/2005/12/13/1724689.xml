        <p>Ron Artest, the Indiana Pacers' troubled and talented star, asked to be traded over the weekend from the team that had supported him through his 73-game suspension for his role in a brawl last season. Yesterday, the Pacers' chief executive, Donnie Walsh, said he was tired of the distraction and would grant Artest's request.</p>
        <p>As the sweepstakes for Artest started, Walsh told him not to go to practice and said he would keep him on the inactive list this week. Artest, a former All-Star forward and defensive player of the year, had a wrist injury and was not scheduled to play in the Pacers' game at Boston tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'Look, with your statements, they are at the point now that they are a distraction to the team,' '' Walsh said in a telephone interview. '' 'I will look to see if you can be traded.'</p>
        <p>''One thing rang true to me. I told him: 'As long as you're here, you got a lot of baggage over your head. It's worse on you and worse on us.' I'm at the point when I have to get rid of the baggage. It's better for both situations if we look to see somebody out there to do a deal with.''</p>
        <p>The Indianapolis Star quoted Artest saying Saturday that he felt he could not get away from reminders of the brawl as long as he was in a Pacers uniform. Artest said that he wanted to play in New York -- he grew up in Queens and played at St. John's -- but later amended that statement by saying he would go to any team, including a losing one.</p>
        <p>Despite Artest's history of volatility and his role as the instigator of the brawl with the Detroit Pistons, several teams are interested because of his tenacious defense and all-out effort on the court.</p>
        <p>The Pacers have had an uneven start to the season, but their record is tied for second best in the Eastern Conference at 12-7, four games behind the Pistons, the Central Division leaders. Artest, in his seventh full season, leads the team in minutes (37.7) and has averaged 19.4 points and 2.63 steals.</p>
        <p>''With all that people are saying about us, we still have the second-best record in conference,'' Walsh said. ''You pick up the paper and it's all about Ron Artest and nothing about the team.''</p>
        <p>Jermaine O'Neal, the Pacers' captain, was quoted by The Associated Press yesterday as saying: ''I'm not going to answer any more questions about Ron Artest. Ron doesn't want to be here, so Ron doesn't matter anymore.''</p>
        <p>But he will matter to other teams.</p>
        <p>Out of respect for the Pacers' organization, Isiah Thomas, the Knicks' president, has not called to inquire about Artest. Thomas, who has coached Artest and is said to have a good relationship with him, is monitoring the situation. If anyone is familiar with the risk-reward scale for Artest, it is Thomas. Coach Larry Brown said he and Thomas had not spoken about acquiring Artest.</p>
        <p>''He's great on both ends of the court,'' Brown said. ''I think he's tremendous. Every night, he goes out and gives an unbelievable effort. That's huge in this league.''</p>
        <p>But Brown noted that perhaps the Knicks were not the best fit for Artest. ''He said he wanted freedom,'' Brown, who is known for keeping tight reins on his players, said with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>There are limits to what the Knicks would do to make a trade for Artest. Artest has a moderate salary, making $6.8 million this season, and his contract expires after the 2007-8 season. Knicks officials have made it clear that they would be reluctant to part with the rookie Channing Frye, who is their most attractive asset. The Knicks' other young prospects -- the rookies Nate Robinson and David Lee and the second-year pro Trevor Ariza -- are unproven and thus unlikely to be enough to acquire an All-Star talent like Artest.</p>
        <p>Any deal involving the Knicks' rookies would also be complicated by league rules that require a roughly equal amount of salary on each side of the trade. Frye makes $2.2 million, Robinson $1.1 million and Lee $861,000.</p>
        <p>The Knicks could offer Jamal Crawford ($6.5 million) or Quentin Richardson ($6.9 million) in a straight-up deal, but the Pacers are certain to receive stronger offers. Indiana is already set at point guard, with Jamaal Tinsley and Sarunas Jasikevicius, so the Pacers would probably not want Stephon Marbury.</p>
        <p>The Nets desperately need the defensive toughness that Artest offers. One Eastern Conference executive, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the Nets' intentions, said the Nets would probably discuss Artest, although his instability would be a concern. The Pacers took measures to protect Artest and nurture him after the brawl and at the beginning of this season. Until last weekend, they were not seeking to trade him, and Walsh said Artest was a ''model citizen.''</p>
        <p>Walsh said he believed that a fresh start would be best for all parties.</p>
        <p>''He feels like there's a lot of overreaction to what he says and does,'' Walsh said, ''It's true, if Ronnie goes out on the court and hits a player, say a flagrant foul, right away I'm flinching. If he does it, it's a major thing. He doesn't come with the same baggage if he goes to a new franchise. He can have a new history.''</p>
