        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Broken Chord'' by Daniel J. Wakin [Dec. 11]:</p>
        <p>As a wind player whose mate usually plays first violin in several string quartets I can shed some light on the inner conflicts of string quartet playing. There will always be some problems between the first and second violinists, just as with Hertz and Avis.</p>
        <p>The first violin is not only the nominal leader but also the musical director, while the cello maintains the tempo and sets the pitch. Each member has to sacrifice some individuality to create one magnificent voice. In most quartets, the members defer to the musical ideas presented by the first violin. The fact that other violinists came and went is an indication that the three members want to control the first violin part, like the tail wagging the dog. It is a pity that so many had to suffer financially in the pursuit of art.</p>
