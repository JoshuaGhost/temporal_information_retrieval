        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I really do not understand the logic that by buying an artificial Christmas tree, one more real tree would still be standing in a field (''In a Cold Sweat,'' Dec. 18). What happens if there are no buyers for the trees on the New Jersey Christmas farms? A new crop of condos will sprout up, and those who want real trees will buy ones trucked down from Nova Scotia. Perhaps I am wrong in thinking that ''buy local'' applies to Christmas trees. But it's better to buy local than support the petroleum industry by buying an artificial tree.</p>
