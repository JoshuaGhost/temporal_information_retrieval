        <p>The Teamsters' general secretary-treasurer, C. Thomas Keegel, was riding high last week after noting that the Coca-Cola Company recently acceded to the union's plea on executive compensation. The company agreed to ask shareholders before agreeing to executive severance agreements that total at least 2.99 times the annual salary and bonus of the executive being severed.</p>
        <p>Coke investors may see this as good news. The company gave one former chairman and C.E.O., M. Douglas Ivester, a $119 million severance package after only three years in the corner office; Coke's share price fell more than 10 percent in that time. The man he beat out for the job, Steven J. Heyer, got a $24 million send-off, also after three years on the job. And Mr. Ivester's successor, Douglas N. Daft, received $36 million when he left after just four years.</p>

        <p>The new Coke policy will apply to its current chief executive, E. Neville Isdell. But it certainly does not apply to Coca-Cola Enterprises, a bottling company about one-third owned by Coke.</p>
        <p>The bottler's C.E.O., John R. Alm, is about to retire after two years in the top job, where he earned a shade over $1 million last year. The company said it would send him off with $6.48 million in cash and $4 million in stock.</p>
