        <p>One of the more colorful developments in the soap opera known as ''who will Jon S. Corzine choose as his successor for the United States Senate'' was the latest flare-up between the former Senator Robert Torricelli and Representative Robert Menendez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, it is said, ushered Mr. Corzine into politics by encouraging him to run for the Senate, and continues to provide advice. And Mr. Menendez was one of Mr. Corzine's leading allies during the governor's race this year.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Menendez may have a common ally, Mr. Corzine's election has clearly not brought them closer together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli told The Philadelphia Inquirer last week that there were ''inherent risks'' for Governor-elect Corzine if he planned to follow through with the widely anticipated choice of Mr. Menendez to succeed him when he vacates his Senate seat on Jan 17.</p>
        <p>''I think the choice is enormously important for Corzine because it's the first look at his priorities and judgment,'' Mr. Torricelli said in the interview, referring, no doubt, to articles about Mr. Menendez's relationship with a female former staff member who is now a successful lobbyist. ''So who this individual is will reveal a good deal about Jon Corzine, and I think he knows that.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Menendez responded in kind. ''Bob Torricelli is the last person to be giving ethics lessons to anyone,'' said the spokesman, Matthew Miller, referring to an ethics scandal that drove the former senator out of a race for re-election in 2002.</p>
