        <p>WILSON -- Katherine Stern. Age 79, died on Friday, November 25, surrounded by members of her devoted family. Death was due to complications of cancer and came only after a long and courageous fight. She is survived by her husband Philip, two daughters: Lucy and Elizabeth Watson; three sons: William Watson, Patrick and David Wilson; and ten grandchildren, all of whom are overcome by their loss, and struggling with the reason as to why. Kit was a delightful, caring person who made the world a better place in which to live. She was an avid reader, but enjoyed social interaction and had a quick wit. She could exchange jokes with the best. She was also proficient in many athletic pursuits, but the game of tennis, the skills of which she acquired as a teenager from the incomparable teachings of Dorothy Wightman, was her first love. She practiced it artfully and effectively much to the dismay of opponents, the gratitude of partners and the admiration of all. Kit also derived much pleasure from the intimate and enduring friendships she maintained with many persons from all over. These relationships were of utmost importance to her and remained at the top of her mind until the bitter end. Were she able, she would be the first among her family to thank all those dear friends for their tender condolences, for which the severity of her illness impaired direct and timely acknowledgement; likewise to express her and our gratitude to the loving and tireless caregivers who comforted her and her family during her passing. No burial service is planned.</p>
