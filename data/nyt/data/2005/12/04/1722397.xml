        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''More Options to Answer 'What About the Kids?' '' (Nov. 27):</p>
        <p>Congratulations on a well-written piece. The key critical issue was raised up front -- that any comparisons between children of divorce and those of intact families must look at high-conflict intact families. Elizabeth Marquardt is described as a scholar associated with a pro-marriage organization. Her conclusions, however, seem to be based on an unpublished, not peer-reviewed, survey that supports her individual feelings and the bias of her organization.</p>

        <p>Congratulations on a well-written piece. The key critical issue was raised up front -- that any comparisons between children of divorce and those of intact families must look at high-conflict intact families. Elizabeth Marquardt is described as a scholar associated with a pro-marriage organization. Her conclusions, however, seem to be based on an unpublished, not peer-reviewed, survey that supports her individual feelings and the bias of her organization.</p>
        <p>As a psychologist who has done hundreds of custody mediations and studies, I do not believe we need moralistic junk science foisted on parents who already feel tremendous guilt over their decision to separate. Those who end up in court are often in high-conflict relationships, where the kids are glad to be out of a stressful and sometimes dangerous household.</p>
        <p>We can all agree that what kids really need is one or two loving parents with similar values, who work together to raise them, whether in one household or two.</p>
