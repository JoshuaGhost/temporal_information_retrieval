        <p>THE FOUR FEATHERS (1939)  Saturday at 10 p.m. on TCM.  Lt. Harry Faversham (John Clements) is descended from a long line of military heroes, but he's a pacifist himself. When he faces up to that and resigns his commission, the men in his unit call him a coward. But after they are captured during a mission in Sudan, he proves them thoroughly wrong by disguising himself as an Arab fighter and setting out to free them. When this action film first opened in New York, B. R. Crisler, writing in The New York Times, declared it ''fine, stirring, gorgeously Technicolored'' and ''explosively cinematic.'' The film also stars C. Aubrey Smith, as a general who loves telling people how he won the Crimean War, and a very young Ralph Richardson (above). Zoltan Korda (brother of Alexander) directed.</p>
        <p>IMAGINE: JOHN LENNON (1988)  Sunday at 10 a.m. and Thursday at 1 p.m. on HBO2.  The great thing about this documentary is that Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, handed over 240 hours of film and videotape to the director, Andrew Solt, and this is the result. And Lennon (left, with Ms. Ono in 1972) narrates the film himself, having given a few interviews over the years and having taped 40 hours or so of looking-back-at-life thoughts just weeks before his death. It's all here: Lennon's childhood, his well-documented private life (two marriages, two sons), the Beatles' rise to fame, his political activism and his final years. Lennon was murdered on Dec. 8, 1980, 25 years ago this Thursday.</p>
        <p>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 4.  We know the story well. George Bailey (James Stewart), a small-town boy who had always meant to get out, is on the verge of suicide when a slightly dopey angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) intervenes. Clarence shows George just how awful life would be for a number of people -- the whole town of Bedford Falls, in fact -- if he had never been born. George's wife, Mary (Donna Reed), for instance, would have been a very frumpy old-maid librarian. It all begins when the easily distracted Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell, right, with Stewart) loses $8,000 at the bank. Frank Capra directed.</p>
        <p>YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS (1998)  Saturday at 8 and 11:45 p.m. on IFC.  This was Neil LaBute's second film, after ''In the Company of Men,'' which had made a splash the year before, and he was just getting up to speed in his reflections on contemporary human cruelty. Three urban couples -- played by Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhart, Catherine Keener, Ben Stiller, Nastassja Kinski and Jason Patric (left, with Ms. Keener) -- have joyless sex in their own ways. Then they meet. Mr. Eckhart's character, like his scheming businessman in ''In the Company of Men,'' is memorable for his misogyny.</p>
