        <p>Cornelia Street, a cozy, historic lane that runs from West Fourth Street to Bleecker Street, is home to so many small, alluring places it is often referred to as the restaurant row of Greenwich Village. Here are six choices along the block.</p>
        <p>CORNELIA STREET CAFE  (212) 989-9319; 29 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 7/23/02.</p>
        <p>From readings of poetry to art exhibitions and jazz, this spot has been praised more for cultural nourishment than culinary exploits. But the succulent steamed mussels and hearty soups prove that there is more to this friendly place than great entertainment.</p>
        <p>HOME  (212) 243-9579; 20 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 11/6/02.</p>
        <p>Home serves stylized renditions of American classics. The husband-and-wife owners, David Page and Barbara Shinn, offer dishes that touch a nostalgic chord without being sentimental, like meaty pork chops and, at lunch, a terrific hamburger served with rich homemade ketchup and onion rings.</p>
        <p>LE GIGOT  (212) 627-3737; 18 Cornelia Street; $$; Article: 12/22/00.</p>
        <p>If memories of Paris stimulate your romantic nerve, Le Gigot should set you atingle. From the beautiful parquet floor to the mirrored walls crisscrossed with polished wood to the little zinc bar and window seats, Le Gigot pulses with the welcoming spirit of a Parisian hangout. The current menu includes bouillabaisse, duck confit and crab cakes.</p>
        <p>LITTLE HAVANA  (212) 255-2212; 30 Cornelia Street; $; $25 and Under: 2/18/98, Article: 3/17/00.</p>
        <p>This restaurant combines classic Cuban dishes like black bean soup; shredded skirt steak with rice and beans; and arroz con pollo with an appreciation for organic, healthy ingredients. The result is lighter Cuban food that sacrifices little of the flavor.</p>
        <p>PEARL OYSTER BAR  (212) 691-8211; 18 Cornelia Street; $; Article: 8/27/03.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Charles founded Pearl Oyster Bar in 1997 in homage to the fresh seafood she grew up eating on summer vacations in Maine. Beyond the oysters, lobster rolls are meaty and delicious, chowder is made with smoked bacon and clams, and the blueberry pie is sensational.</p>
        <p>PÓ  (212) 645-2189; 31 Cornelia Street; $; $25 and Under: 6/6/01.</p>
        <p>This Italian bistro was made famous by its original owner, Mario Batali. In 2000 Mr. Batali officially cut his ties to Pó, leaving it solely in the hands of his partner, Steven Crane. Today the food is as good it was years ago. What's more, the prices have stayed remarkably reasonable.</p>
        <p>Current selections include grilled Italian sausages served with white beans, broccoli rabe and black olive pesto; and veal Marsala.</p>
