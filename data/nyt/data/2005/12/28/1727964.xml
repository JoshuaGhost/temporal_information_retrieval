Alito Jr. faces hearings may depend on how President Bush recovers from the damage his approval ratings from the botched response to Hurricane Katrina and the leak investigation that threatens the White House's political genius, Karl Rove, surely one man in this administration, other than Mr. Bush himself, who really can make a difference.</p>
