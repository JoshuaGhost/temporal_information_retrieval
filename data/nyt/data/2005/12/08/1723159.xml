        <p>JEWISH immigrants who arrived in the United States in great numbers in the middle of the 19th and 20th centuries did so, by coincidence, at moments of major advancement in apparel manufacturing. As an exhibition that opened at the Yeshiva University Museum in Manhattan this week demonstrates, it was a convergence that shaped both the fashion industry and the Jewish experience for more than a century.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Goldstein, the curator of the exhibition, which examines the history of the garment industry from 1860 to 1960, said the histories were so closely tied that for much of the 20th century virtually every step of apparel production in this country involved manufacturers or stores that were owned by Jewish families.</p>

        <p>JEWISH immigrants who arrived in the United States in great numbers in the middle of the 19th and 20th centuries did so, by coincidence, at moments of major advancement in apparel manufacturing. As an exhibition that opened at the Yeshiva University Museum in Manhattan this week demonstrates, it was a convergence that shaped both the fashion industry and the Jewish experience for more than a century.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Goldstein, the curator of the exhibition, which examines the history of the garment industry from 1860 to 1960, said the histories were so closely tied that for much of the 20th century virtually every step of apparel production in this country involved manufacturers or stores that were owned by Jewish families.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you went to a family bar mitzvah, it ended up being a garment industry convention,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Advances in manufacturing, like the invention of the first commercially successful sewing machine; sociological events including the demand for ready-made clothing at the beginning of the 20th century; and moments in history, like the Civil War, which created a great demand for military uniforms, all acted as catalysts for the growing industry, Mr. Goldstein said. These developments gave the more than three million Central and Eastern Europe immigrants then entering the United States a chance to prosper. Mr. Goldstein called the confluence, and the Yeshiva exhibition, open through April 2, ''A Perfect Fit.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition offers an inclusive view of manufacturing and retail from Baltimore to Los Angeles, from early examples of underwear to the symbiotic relationship between Hollywood and fashion designers. A 1940 film, ''Susan and God,'' with Joan Crawford in an Adrian dress, was shown with a clip that directed audiences to department stores for line-for-line copies.</p>
        <p>Many of the most famous names in American fashion grew out of businesses founded by Jewish families, including Levi Strauss, Hickey Freeman, Nettie Rosenstein, Hattie Carnegie, Anne Klein and Bloomingdale's. Some of the most famous Jewish designers adjusted their names: Nudie Cohn, the tailor of outrageous Western wear on Rodeo Drive, was born Nutya Kotlyrenko in Kiev; Norman Norell, one of the founders of American fashion design, was born David Levinson; and Arnold Scaasi, the evening-wear designer, created his brand by spelling his birth name, Isaacs, backward.</p>
        <p>''The industry was so informed by its Jewish presence and involvement that one could not fully understand its history without looking at the role the American Jew has played,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''And you cannot understand the Jewish experience without looking at the history of the industry.''</p>
        <p>I Read It on a DVD</p>
        <p>In the first issue of the latest magazine to focus on fashion, Alex Freund photographed Zac Posen's spring collection on a model lying on a hardwood floor. Tiziano Magni conveyed the spirit of a Calvin Klein dress by showing a naked woman taking a shower. This is conventional storytelling by fashion standards, but the format has changed. The quarterly magazine, called Fly, is presented on a DVD, which adds to the traditional two-dimensional paper format the components of motion, dialogue and music.</p>
        <p>''This allows us to present material in a different way,'' said Nima Abbasi, the publisher of Fly. The project was put together by a group of friends in fashion and publishing. They call the company Vandelay Industries, a name plucked from episodes of ''Seinfeld.''</p>
        <p>The stylist Lisa Mosko began working with Catherine Kushman and Stephen Ghukfvin, the creative director and editor of Fly, to encourage designers to support the idea of a magazine that presents fashion in a new medium. Although they were unable to secure advertising for the first issue, several influential retailers, like Colette in Paris, 10 Corso Como in Milan and the Dover Street Market in London, will stock the $45 DVD. In New York, it will be available at Seven New York and Soho House next week.</p>
        <p>The first issue offers a slick and seamless presentation of 14 collections and numerous features, with links that let a viewer connect to the designers' Web sites when viewing the DVD on a computer.</p>
        <p>But if there is a thing that DVD really can't do, it is to make models into actors.</p>
        <p>''We weren't trying to achieve Chekhov,'' Ms. Kushman said. ''It's supposed to be fun.''</p>
