        <p>Don Imus, below, and Walter Cronkite were among the 32 members elected to the inaugural class of the New York State Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame on Thursday night. The Gambling family, whose roots in New York radio date to 1925, was honored with three inductions: John B., John A. and John R. Gambling, each representing a different generation of hosts of the famous ''Rambling With Gambling'' program on WOR (710 AM). Frankie Crocker, the former program director of WBLS (107.5 FM) and WLIB (1190 AM), who died in 2000, was also inducted. So was Mr. Cronkite's old boss, the CBS and Museum of Television and Radio founder, William S. Paley, who died in 1990. The Broadcasters Association is a nonprofit organization based in Albany.</p>
