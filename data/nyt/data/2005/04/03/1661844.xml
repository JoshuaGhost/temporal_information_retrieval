        <p>Some writers win Nobel Prizes. Some inspire parody contests. Some -- well, Ernest Hemingway -- do both. So there's still hope for David Mamet, subject of a ''Write Like Mamet'' contest at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. Nearly 100 aspiring tough guys (and gals) entered the derby, held to publicize the premiere of Mr. Mamet's adaptation of Harley Granville-Barker's ''Voysey Inheritance.'' The 10 winners had their expletive-laced entries read at the Geary Theater after performances of ''Voysey'' on Friday and Saturday. As these excerpts show, the winners found ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' to be Mr. Mamet's most imitable, or at least most familiar, work. Unlike the real estate salesmen of ''Glengarry,'' the writers didn't stand to win a Cadillac or even a set of steak knives. But as far as we know, they weren't viciously insulted by Alec Baldwin.</p>

        <p>ALEC Daniel's out.  STEPHEN He's  ALEC Out, Stephen. It is my belief, and hence a Fact to the two of you, that our good brother Daniel has been a Baldwin for far too long. He is, even more than the two of you, he is a disgrace to my name. As such, he no longer gets to use it.  BILLY But why?  ALEC Why? Why? Because I said so, that's why.  STEPHEN Look, Alec--  ALEC Don't you dare interrupt me! Stephen: you were paid for ''Slap Shot 2,'' right? You made money from it, you didn't do it for the Artistic Merit, did you?  STEPHEN I was paid, yeah.  ALEC And so: In your cute little three-room, you are able to afford basic cable, is that correct?  STEPHEN Al, I--  ALEC I assume, then, you're familiar with VH1.  STEPHEN I was even on an episode of ''I Love the 90's,'' Al.  ALEC Well, that's [expletive] neat for you. The Point Is: Our good brother Daniel has decided it is within the Realm of the Acceptable to trade on my good name to appear on a show they call ''Celebrity Fit Club'' Do you know what ''Celebrity Fit Club'' is, Billy?  BILLY It's a reality show, isn't it?  ALEC It is Company for Fat Housewives. Do I want my name associated with fat housewives, Billy?  BILLY No.  ALEC I do not. Hence: Daniel is no longer a Baldwin. As the two of you still are, he is no longer your brother. Is that understood?</p>
        <p>'MAMLET'  By Nihar Patel (Los Angeles)</p>
        <p>An empty stage. All performers are dressed in modern business suits.  CLAUDIUS (Ricky Jay) You are a gentlemenly fool. And you haven't closed a castle in months. You're old hat, and that comes from downtown.  MAMLET (William H. Macy) Old hat? Old hat. Let's wait Claudius. Claudius, wait, back up here. I can close, all I need are those Elsinore leads. I want them and I want them posthaste.  CLAUDIUS Go to Norway Mamlet. Will you.  MAMLET Give me two good leads. Anon.  CLAUDIUS Just go to Norway.  MAMLET I don't want to go to Norway.  CLAUDIUS Go to Norway, Mamlet.  MAMLET Where does he get off to talk that way to a Prince? It's not  CLAUDIUS Will you get out of here. Will you get out of here. Will you. I'm trying to run a kingdom here. Will you go to Norway? Go to Norway. Will you go to Norway?  MAMLET You stupid [expletive][expletive].  Mamlet stabs Claudius.</p>
        <p>'THE GENTLEMAN CALLER'  By Jonathan Joy (Proctorville, Ohio)</p>
        <p>Ricky Roma from ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' and Laura from ''The Glass Menagerie'' are talking.  ROMA I'm not here to judge you. You want to collect glass pieces, you do it. You want to take care of your brother when he comes stumbling in that door every night, so be it. You want to sit on this couch and listen to your mother talk about all the gentleman callers she had and point out the lack of men you got walking through that door, that's fine.  LAURA I can't --  ROMA This may be the only opportunity you have to get away. You think your brother is going to stick around much longer? Hell, no. He'll be out the door and on to live his own life and you'll be stuck here taking care of Amanda Wingfield until the day she dies. Then what?  LAURA I don't know.  ROMA Then you'll be on your own with nothing to show for it. I'm offering you a future, Laura. Your own land. A beautiful piece of property on the coast of Florida.</p>
