        <p>THIS year's Forbes list of the world's billionaires is out, and as usual, the news is bad. You didn't make it. Neither did I.</p>
        <p>But you may have imagined that you did. You may have fantasized about what it would be like to have multiple homes, to cruise around on your yacht and spend time counting your cash. If you are in business, you may even derive some tepid comfort from knowing that the club isn't closed. Indeed, the overall number of billionaires found by Forbes was 691 this time around, up from 587 the previous year. In other words, there's hope.</p>

        <p>THIS year's Forbes list of the world's billionaires is out, and as usual, the news is bad. You didn't make it. Neither did I.</p>
        <p>But you may have imagined that you did. You may have fantasized about what it would be like to have multiple homes, to cruise around on your yacht and spend time counting your cash. If you are in business, you may even derive some tepid comfort from knowing that the club isn't closed. Indeed, the overall number of billionaires found by Forbes was 691 this time around, up from 587 the previous year. In other words, there's hope.</p>
        <p>But even if billionaire status never arrives, allow me to set your yearnings at ease. Do not envy these people. For most of the superrich, the benefits of each additional dollar of wealth reached the vanishing point long ago. I can't speak from experience, of course, but in all likelihood, having billions does not offer significant advantages over having mere millions and it imposes the disadvantage of some major burdens. The focus on billionaires obscures a sad fallacy, one embodied for most of us not so much in the assets of Bill Gates -- still at the top of the Forbes list -- as in the lure of the lottery.</p>
        <p>The prospect of big lottery prizes typically sets off a ticket-buying frenzy among throngs of people who variously hope to quit their boring jobs, pay their debts and secure their children's future by winning. But their behavior makes little sense, except to the extent that they are buying entertainment. For most of them, a scant million or two would solve almost all the problems that a billion would. Sensible lottery players seek the more favorable odds of winning a smaller but still transformative prize instead of lining up for an infinitesimally small chance of winning a meaninglessly gigantic sum that offers few marginal benefits.</p>
        <p>People make this kind of mistake all the time. That humans are so strikingly bad at weighing risks and rewards is one of the great paradoxes of evolution, and it makes you wonder how we outlasted the mastodons.</p>
        <p>The lottery fallacy is sad because so many more of us could become millionaires, as was amply demonstrated by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko in their fascinating book, ''The Millionaire Next Door.'' They found that inheritances or even extended educations aren't necessary; the main requirement, given time and a decent income, is thrift.</p>
        <p>Becoming a millionaire offers a measure of security, as well as access to better health care and schools. Consider that each $1 million in capital invested in a conservative mix of stocks and bonds would comfortably throw off something like the average annual household income -- about $44,000. While a net worth of $1 million would put you in the top 7 percent of American households, you should not assume that it will make you deliriously happy; the weak connection between money and happiness is well established, at least for those of us already fortunate enough to be living a standard middle-class lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Billions of dollars, on the other hand, would distort your life in so many ways that they just aren't worth it. Billionaires often worry about their personal safety and that of their families. They may also worry about whether people really like them or their money, about how to avoid producing hopelessly spoiled or feckless children and about their own potential for psychologically destructive ''maximizing'' behavior. ''Maximizers'' search compulsively for the best of everything, with perennial disappointment a main result.</p>
        <p>If there are good reasons to become a billionaire, they are largely altruistic. Making all that money means that you are probably providing something that people need or want -- a good thing in its own right. The capital you have accumulated should result in jobs, innovation and economic growth, even as your tax payments underwrite services for the rest of society. If you like, you can create a foundation to direct the earnings of your capital to good works. You can even give all the money away.</p>
        <p>All in all, billionaires are useful to society, and assuming they didn't become rich by nefarious means, we should thank them for taking the trouble. It's a dirty job, after all, but somebody's got to do it.</p>
