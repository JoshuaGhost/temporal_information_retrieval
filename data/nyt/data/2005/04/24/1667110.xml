        <p>BELLOW'S BREAKTHROUGH: Saul Bellow, who died earlier this month at 89, won the Nobel Prize, three National Book Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, yet he was no stranger to the Times best-seller list. For a stretch of almost 30 years -- from the publication of ''Henderson the Rain King'' in 1959 through the release of ''More Die of Heartbreak'' in 1987 -- nearly everything Bellow wrote appeared for two months or so on the hardcover fiction or nonfiction list. It took the public time to pick up on Bellow's busy, rueful, comic charms. None of his first four novels -- ''Dangling Man'' (1944), ''The Victim'' (1947), ''The Adventures of Augie March'' (1953) or ''Seize the Day'' (1956) -- made this page. Bellow's real breakthrough came in 1964 with ''Herzog,'' a novel about a failed academic whose wife leaves him for his best friend. The book was praised on the cover of the Book Review and held on at No. 1 for more than seven months. (The book it bumped out of the top slot: John le Carré's ''Spy Who Came In From the Cold.'') Twenty years after the publication of his first novel, Bellow was financially secure. In his biography of Bellow, James Atlas writes that female readers were particularly taken with ''Herzog,'' and with its dashing author. Women would write to him, Bellow said in a television interview, ''to ask me how they should behave with intellectuals, for recipes of dishes mentioned in the book. They make me feel like an editor of Vogue.''</p>
        <p>CHANGING PLACES: There are new No. 1 and No. 2 books on both hardcover lists this week. On the nonfiction side, ''My Life So Far,'' by Jane Fonda, and ''The World Is Flat,'' by Thomas L. Friedman, knock off last week's Nos. 1 and 2, Malcolm Gladwell's ''Blink'' and Catherine Crier and Cole Thompson's ''Deadly Game.'' On the fiction list, Mary Higgins Clark's ''No Place Like Home'' and Sue Monk Kidd's ''Mermaid Chair'' climb atop Dan Brown's ''Da Vinci Code'' and Matthew Stover's ''Revenge of the Sith.'' Of these four new books, Sue Monk Kidd's is the stealth best seller. ''The Mermaid Chair'' is her second novel; her first, ''The Secret Life of Bees,'' was published in 2002 and caught on gradually with readers in its softcover edition -- it appeared on the paperback list for more than 80 weeks. Before she turned to fiction, Kidd published several books about spirituality and was a contributing editor for Guideposts magazine. She wasn't fully aware of how popular ''The Secret Life of Bees'' had become, she has written, until she turned on ''Jeopardy!'' in a hotel room one night and heard a contestant select the category ''Women Writers'' for $600, after which Alex Trebek intoned, ''Sue Monk Kidd's debut novel is about this insect.'' The answer: ''What are bees, Alex?''</p>
