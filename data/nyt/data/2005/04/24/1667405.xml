        <p>St. Peter's Square will again be flooded with pilgrims and pageantry on Sunday when Pope Benedict XVI is installed as leader of the Roman Catholic Church at an outdoor Mass marked by both innovations and long-forgotten traditions.</p>
        <p>While Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected by the College of Cardinals as the 265th pope on Tuesday, and has made several appearances and speeches in his new white robes, the 78-year-old German formally takes the papal throne during Sunday's ceremony of investiture.</p>
        <p>Italian officials expect about 100,000 people from Germany alone to come to the Mass. On Saturday, Vatican workers laid grass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica while Rome's civil protection workers prepared for the huge crowds by lining guardrails along the Via della Conciliazione, the broad avenue that leads to the Vatican.</p>
        <p>The two-hour ceremony, celebrated by the senior cardinal deacon, Jorge Arturo Medina Estévez, a Chilean who announced Benedict to the world, will have the familiar framework and rituals of a regular Sunday Mass.</p>
        <p>But the Vatican said Saturday that there would also be some novelties.</p>
        <p>Before the ceremony begins, the pope will for the first time make a solemn visit to what Catholics believe is the tomb of St. Peter, in the basilica's crypt. Waiting for him there will be the symbols of his papal authority, the Fisherman's Ring and pallium, a narrow stole of white wool.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Crispino Valenziano, an expert on liturgical rites at the Vatican, said at a news conference Saturday that officials from the Association of Rome's Goldsmiths fitted the pope for the Fisherman's Ring two days ago, and that when Benedict was told he wore a size 24 ring, he said, ''I like 24, it's the double of 12,'' referring to the number of apostles.</p>
        <p>Father Valenziano also said that the Mass would mark a clear return to early church traditions. Pope Benedict will don a style of pallium that has not been worn for about a millennium. The longer, wider cloth is embroidered with five red silk crosses, three of them pierced with pins to signify the nails used to crucify Jesus Christ. The black hem represents the hooves of sheep.</p>
        <p>After the Mass, the pope is expected to make a tour of the square, though Father Valenziano suggested that he would probably not use the ''popemobile,'' often used by Pope John Paul II.</p>
        <p>Italian officials plan to bolster security on Sunday, closing airspace within a five-mile radius of the Vatican from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and shutting down one of Rome's airports.</p>
        <p>Representatives and religious leaders of more than 30 countries are expected on Sunday morning, including Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany; Prince Albert II of Monaco; King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía of Spain; the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Rowan Williams; Chrisostomos, a top envoy for Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world's Christian Orthodox; and a senior representative of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Kirill.</p>
        <p>The American delegation will be led by President Bush's younger brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.</p>
        <p>''He is a man of God and a deep thinker,'' said Governor Bush, who converted to Catholicism in 1995. ''I think he will be a fine leader of the church.''</p>
