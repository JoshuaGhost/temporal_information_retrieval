      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Steve Shaw, a Brooklyn investment banker seeking the Republican nomination for mayor, likes to knock Michael R. Bloomberg, a former Democrat, for being an opportunistic latecomer to the party.</p>
        <p>''I'm the only Republican in the race,'' he said in December.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that Mr. Bloomberg has been a Republican longer than Mr. Shaw, who only registered with the party last year, shortly before he announced his long-shot bid to unseat the mayor. Prior to that, Mr. Shaw was listed in voter registration records as ''nonpartisan,'' and he confirmed yesterday that he ''was always independent until I decided to run for political office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaw's status as a lifelong independent serves as yet another reminder of the difficulty the city's Republicans have finding candidates -- and voters -- whose Republican bona fides run deeper than a coat of varnish.</p>
        <p>Registered Democrats in the city outnumber Republicans five to one, making for an unbalanced political seesaw that is reflected in, among other places, the City Council, where only 3 of the 51 members are Republicans. Most of the major Republican candidates for mayor in recent years -- Mr. Bloomberg, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Herman Badillo -- were Democrats who switched parties, largely for pragmatic purposes and not because they were ideologically conservative.</p>
        <p>This year, the only mayoral candidate whose membership in the Republican Party predates the new millennium is Thomas V. Ognibene, a former City Councilman from Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaw, 30, emerged on the scene seemingly out of nowhere last year. Raised in Pennsylvania, he moved to New York eight years ago and, by his own account, had no prior involvement in politics before deciding to run for mayor and was not registered with any political party.</p>
        <p>He has since cloaked himself in conservative Republicanism, posting on his campaign Web site a paean he wrote to Ronald Reagan, attacking Mr. Bloomberg for betraying core Republican priorities on taxes and the economy, and belittling the mayor's pre-election decision to join the party in 2000 as ''rent-a-party'' expediency done to avoid competing in a crowded Democratic field.</p>
        <p>Asked whether his own recent switch to the party was similar to Mr. Bloomberg's, Mr. Shaw vigorously disagreed.</p>
        <p>''It's entirely different; my philosophy has always been conservative,'' he said. ''It's just a matter of crystallizing that with a party affiliation. Mr. Bloomberg has always been a liberal. You'll never see that in any of my history.''</p>
