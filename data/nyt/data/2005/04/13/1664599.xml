        <p>A beluga whale appeared here Tuesday in the Delaware River, drawing hundreds of camera-bearing onlookers to the shore and worrying wildlife officials.</p>
        <p>Eighty miles upstream from the ocean, the whale was also more than 500 miles from the waters off Canada, where it should be at this time of year.

        <p>TRENTON, April 12 - A beluga whale appeared here Tuesday in the Delaware River, drawing hundreds of camera-bearing onlookers to the shore and worrying wildlife officials.</p>

        <p>A beluga whale appeared here Tuesday in the Delaware River, drawing hundreds of camera-bearing onlookers to the shore and worrying wildlife officials.</p>
        <p>Eighty miles upstream from the ocean, the whale was also more than 500 miles from the waters off Canada, where it should be at this time of year. It had already braved river traffic on its way north from the Delaware Bay past Wilmington, Del., Camden and Philadelphia to the fairly tranquil waters here.</p>
        <p>''It's extraordinary for a beluga whale to be outside its range and in waters this fresh and this shallow,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, the state commissioner of environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Jay Pagel, a senior field technician at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, said this beluga was only the second, to his knowledge, that the center had encountered in 25 years. Mr. Pagel said he and the center's director would leave Trenton in the morning, hoping that the whale would be on its way downstream by then.</p>
        <p>The white whale -- estimated by scientists and onlookers at 8 to 15 feet in length, with its age and sex undetermined -- was identified as a beluga by a state biologist called to the river's edge after workers at a marina spotted it, Mr. Campbell said. It spent the afternoon circling just south of the landmark ''Trenton Makes, the World Takes'' bridge between the Capitol district and Morrisville, Pa.</p>
        <p>By late afternoon, whale-watchers lined the river bank, watching for a white arc breaking the surface at long intervals. As evening rush traffic jammed the bridge, television news helicopters churned overhead, and conservation officers in a small boat kept watch.</p>
        <p>(A state police marine unit that was assigned to keep boaters away from the whale suddenly raced off in the early evening to rescue a man whose sailboat had capsized about 10 miles south.)</p>
        <p>''Our priority is to keep traffic and any other kind of disturbance away, so it's not driven farther upriver,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''The least risky path, and our hoped-for path, is for the whale to find its way back to the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell said the whale could be ill but that no further information was expected until marine biologists arrived on Wednesday. He said the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Marine Mammal Stranding Center would send experts.</p>
