        <p>Article on television's latest genre, fictionalized shows about entertainment business, including HBO's Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Unscripted, Showtime's Fat Actress starring Kirstie Alley, and ABC's Jake in Progress; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For decades, Hollywood enticed audiences by creating television shows that promised them a clear view into the inner workings of police stations, hospitals and law offices. But after dozens of shows pulled back the curtains on those professions, their mystery and allure began to fade. So, locked in the writing room, sitting through endless pitch meetings, Hollywood found gold, or at least dramatic fodder, in its own bellybutton.</p>
        <p>Now all kinds of Hollywood procedurals are sprouting on television, offering shows that render the entertainment business in all of its tawdry glory. HBO's ''Entourage'' pivots around an entitled posse trailing in the wake of the industry's next bright young thing. ''Fat Actress,'' which began recently on Showtime, follows the corpulent arc of a barely fictionalized Kirstie Alley as she tries to revive her career. Lisa Kudrow will try a thinner version of the same premise on ''Comeback,'' which will be on HBO this spring.</p>

        <p>For decades, Hollywood enticed audiences by creating television shows that promised them a clear view into the inner workings of police stations, hospitals and law offices. But after dozens of shows pulled back the curtains on those professions, their mystery and allure began to fade. So, locked in the writing room, sitting through endless pitch meetings, Hollywood found gold, or at least dramatic fodder, in its own bellybutton.</p>
        <p>Now all kinds of Hollywood procedurals are sprouting on television, offering shows that render the entertainment business in all of its tawdry glory. HBO's ''Entourage'' pivots around an entitled posse trailing in the wake of the industry's next bright young thing. ''Fat Actress,'' which began recently on Showtime, follows the corpulent arc of a barely fictionalized Kirstie Alley as she tries to revive her career. Lisa Kudrow will try a thinner version of the same premise on ''Comeback,'' which will be on HBO this spring.</p>
        <p>Earlier this season, HBO weighed in with ''Unscripted''; while the dialogue in the series, produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, may have been unscripted, the story lines about young actors trying to claw their way into the business were carefully wrought critiques of some of show business's more mundanely brutal aspects.</p>
        <p>And the trend is not restricted to cable television. Last month, ABC trotted out ''Jake in Progress,'' a weekly portrait of a press agent who specializes in repairing the train wrecks celebrities often make of their lives.</p>
        <p>These shows-about-shows are distinct from productions that merely perform lurid taxonomy on celebrities. ''The Osbournes'' is a show about a highly dysfunctional family that happens to be led by a onetime rock god now gone to seed, while ''The Simple Life'' is about celebrities-in-training behaving badly. But there is a group of shows that take an anthropological approach, examining celebrities or people playing celebrities in a cultural context that is meant to critique and send up modern show business.</p>
        <p>While ''Fat Actress'' may be nominally about Kirstie Alley, it has the larger ambition of showing how shallow and objectifying television and film executives can be. Though that could hardly rate as an epiphany -- the Beautiful People will always be beautiful -- the show, along with ''Jake in Progress'' and ''Entourage,'' presumes a public interest in the folkways of show business. It is a gamble -- watching a show that happens to be about a comic or a television writer is a fundamentally different experience from spending time staring at the inner workings of a business that makes its living by creating illusion. The realities of any business -- whether rendered as reality, faux-reality or drama -- are not necessarily intrinsically interesting.</p>
        <p>Like most things on television, the shows are hardly without precedent. In the 1990's HBO delivered ''The Larry Sanders Show,'' a dark look at the bright lights of a television talk show, which was a huge industry favorite but met with indifference from audiences. More recently ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' has found a significant cult of viewers for Larry David's daily adventures in modern Los Angeles living.</p>
        <p>And those who would suggest that shows about show business are one more sign of the bankruptcy of the entertainment industry would do well to recall that ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ''I Love Lucy'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' the holy trinity of the modern sitcom, all had their roots in the media-entertainment complex. And let's not forget that ''Seinfeld,'' which may have been less about the entertainment business than nothing in particular, still used the life of a comic as its chief framing device. But the newer crop of shows are more apt to head right into the entrails of the entertainment business in search of laughs. And part of their appeal is that they go a long way toward life-sizing celebrities and their daily lives.</p>
        <p>''Larry shows that people actually live in Hollywood, and those people can be just as ordinary in their eccentricities,'' Chris Albrecht, the chairman of HBO, said in a reference to Mr. David's show. After a decade of intense celebrity coverage in magazines like Us Weekly and Entertainment Weekly, and nightly doses of industrial-strength news on ''Access Hollywood'' and ''Entertainment Tonight,'' producers are betting that audiences are in on the joke and ready to laugh about it.</p>
        <p>''A generation ago, the sum total of what people knew about show business was what they heard discussed on the Johnny Carson show every night,'' said Robert J. Thompson, a professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University. ''Now there are 24-hour television channels dedicated to entertainment news.''</p>
        <p>The ubiquity of the coverage may have those being covered wondering why they should not have a piece of the pie.</p>
        <p>''Kirstie Alley has already been starring in a show called 'Fat Actress' for the past four years,'' Mr. Thompson said, pointing to the relentless coverage of her ballooning figure and shrinking prospects. ''It is just now she is the one who should be writing the story and getting a piece of the action.''</p>
        <p>But just because increasing numbers of Hollywood writers are adhering to the dictum ''write what you know'' does not mean that people will tune in by the millions. The ratings of ''Fat Actress'' dropped significantly after its first episode, ''Entourage'' is still looking for its own audience on HBO, and ''Jake in Progress'' has not been piling up big numbers either.</p>
        <p>In the first episode of ''Fat Actress,'' Ms. Alley (playing herself) tries to talk John Travolta (playing himself) into making ''Look Whose Talking 4'' before meeting with the NBC executive Jeffrey Zucker (playing himself), who plays a video game under his desk while Ms. Alley prattles on.</p>
        <p>In ''Jake in Progress,'' two competing press agents taunt each other about who has the better items on Page Six, the celebrity-obsessed gossip column of The New York Post. ''Entourage'' features a heavy-lidded star who is more interested in car shopping with his buddies from back home than reading the scripts that are sent to him. This may convulse industry insiders with laughter, but questions remain about whether viewers are interested in watching the show business sausage get made.</p>
        <p>Austin Winsberg, an executive producer of ''Jake in Progress,'' said that like many popular shows, ''Jake'' gains contemporary resonance by feeding off current events. '''Law &amp; Order' always takes these ripped-from-the-headlines news stories and uses them for dramatic effect,'' he said. ''I thought it would be interesting to do the same thing for our show as well, but the headlines would be ripped from Entertainment Weekly or Us Weekly.''</p>
        <p>In that spirit, this season the show has done or will do a take on ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,'' the December-May romance between Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher and the teen-queen throwdown between Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan.</p>
        <p>''There is a very high interest in the mundane aspects of celebrity life,'' said Bonnie Fuller, editorial director of American Media, which publishes Star magazine. ''Magazines like The Star have created interest not just in the glamorous parts of their life, but every other aspect as well.''</p>
        <p>Kurt Andersen, who wrote a very insiderish novel about the entertainment industry called ''Turn of the Century,'' said that what had grown was not so much the public's appetite as the ability to segment and reach niche audiences. ''There is always going to be a million or two million people who are sufficiently versed in the ins and outs of Hollywood, and the economics of cable allows you to reach those people and make a business of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Robert Greenblatt, president of entertainment for Showtime Networks, said shows like ''Fat Actress'' needed to walk a fine line. ''There is much more interest in the inner workings of the business, but we try to stay away from too much of that,'' he said. '''Fat Actress' is about a comeback, which is pretty universal. More than that, I think that cable offers a more sophisticated audience that is tuned into this stuff.''</p>
        <p>But it is tough to swim in those waters without leaving the audience feeling it might need a shower afterward.</p>
        <p>''We are pretty careful of getting too inside,'' said Michael Hirschorn, an executive vice president at VH1, which has found success with ''Celebrity Fit Club,'' ''Celebrity Couples'' and ''The Surreal Life.'' ''Viewers want to see the artist or celebrity go through the annealing, ennobling process of being a pop culture product. They aren't that hip to, or interested in, the business part of that.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hill, creative director of TV Land, a cable channel that features reruns, is not so sure there are many of the uninitiated left.</p>
        <p>''When I talk to viewers, they know what acquisitions are, they know what a promo schedule is,'' he said. ''We don't get as many innocent questions about why shows go away anymore. They know it's ratings.''</p>
        <p>''We're all insiders now,'' he said.</p>
