        <p>A pregnant woman whose body was found floating in the Hudson River on Sunday was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head, the city medical examiner's office said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The woman, Lisa D. Eatmon, 33, of New Lots, Brooklyn, was found near Pier 61 in Chelsea about 7 a.m. The police said that she had not been in the water for long, and that it was believed that she had drifted downstream. The child she was carrying, said by neighbors to be a boy, was in its eighth month, the police said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eatmon was last seen Sunday at 2 a.m. by her 12-year-old daughter, the police said.</p>
        <p>Her family said that the unborn child's father was Roscoe Glinton, 42, a New York City sanitation worker. Last night, two detectives arrived at Mr. Glinton's home in East New York, Brooklyn, and, soon after, left with him. Mr. Glinton left the 10th Precinct on West 20th Street about 10.30 p.m. after being interviewed by detectives. He told reporters, ''It wasn't me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glinton's wife, Deborah Glinton, disappeared in 1998, a law enforcement source said. Her skeletal remains were found along the New York State Thruway more than three years later near Newburgh, where she and Mr. Glinton had lived.</p>
        <p>In 2002, three months after they were discovered, the remains were identified and the state police questioned Mr. Glinton, according to the source. He was never charged with a crime, the source said.</p>
        <p>''We're aware of who he is and of his history,'' said Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>A friend of Ms. Eatmon's, Omar Frye, 45, said he last saw Ms. Eatmon on Saturday night. He said she had told him she wanted to have the baby without Mr. Glinton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eatmon had served in the Army after high school, said a woman answering the phone at Ms. Eatmon's parents' home in Philadelphia. She had been working for Toshiba in New York as a repairwoman, said the woman, who identified herself as an older cousin but declined to give her name.</p>
        <p>A friend from a neighborhood laundry, Maria David, 34, said Ms. Eatmon had been thrilled to be expecting a son, since she already had a daughter.</p>
        <p>''She used to laugh all the time,'' Ms. David said. ''That girl was happy about her baby.''</p>
