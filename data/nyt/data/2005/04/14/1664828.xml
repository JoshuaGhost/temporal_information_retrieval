        <p>The National Court indicted 11 Pakistani men on charges that they raised money for Al Qaeda sympathizers and conspired to commit terrorist acts in Spain. All were arrested last year on suspicion of forming a terrorist cell in Barcelona. Court documents say the recipients of the group's money included Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, known as Muhammad the Egyptian. He is charged with helping to carry out the Madrid train bombings in March 2004 and has boasted that he was their architect. The documents also say the group sent money to the Islamic militants suspected of killing a Wall Street Journal reporter, Daniel Pearl, in 2002 in Pakistan.</p>
