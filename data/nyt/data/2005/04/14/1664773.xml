        <p>A longstanding but controversial plan to rebuild West Street-Route 9A as a tunnel alongside the World Trade Center memorial and Freedom Tower sites has been given up by New York State officials.</p>
        <p>Taking into account many objections -- including protests by Verizon and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, which planned to build a new headquarters on West Street -- the state's Department of Transportation will recommend rebuilding the highway as an eight-lane boulevard at the same grade as surrounding streets.</p>
        <p>It is too early to say whether the abandonment of the tunnel will affect Goldman's decision, disclosed nine days ago, to suspend negotiations on the West Street parcel and look for a site elsewhere in Manhattan. A company spokesman declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>But by embracing a surface boulevard, state officials may have broken one of the bigger logjams in the reconstruction of the trade center site. The at-grade plan will cost about $700 million less than a tunnel, will take less time to build and will cause less disruption of utility lines and other nearby building projects, like Freedom Tower.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki ''believes that this recommendation is the result of an inclusive process which reflects the input of the community and other Lower Manhattan stakeholders,'' a spokeswoman, Lynn Rasic, said yesterday. ''This is the solution that best addresses the needs and concerns that have been raised.''</p>
        <p>She added that Mr. Pataki hoped some of the federal transit money that would have gone into the tunnel could be applied to a direct rail link between Long Island and Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki endorsed the West Street tunnel two years ago, saying it would ''divert loud, fast-moving highway traffic underground to protect the dignity of the memorial, while also providing an elegant welcome at the front door of the World Financial Center.''</p>
        <p>Another argument in favor of a tunnel was that it might serve as a deterrent to car and truck bombs.</p>
        <p>Despite the governor's endorsement, the transportation department had never formally recommended a tunnel. Instead, under the environmental review process, the agency was studying alternatives for rebuilding West Street-Route 9A between Vesey Street and West Thames Street in Battery Park City, just south of Rector Street.</p>
        <p>''Based on the cost difference, the construction impacts to the community, the impacts to utilities and the length of construction, the at-grade alternative fits the goals we outlined in the environmental impact statement,'' said Timothy J. Gilchrist, the agency's director for downstate transportation strategy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilchrist said the state would notify the Federal Highway Administration of its decision in a few weeks. Should federal officials accept the recommendation, he said, design could begin in early summer and take about 18 months. Construction would cost about $225 million, depending on the number of pedestrian bridges and the amount of landscaping and other amenities. It would take about two years to complete.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has been waiting for this decision,'' said William C. Rudin, chairman of the Association for a Better New York. He said the recommendation would ''solve a lot of pieces of the puzzle.''</p>
        <p>Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said that the decision on West Street ''allows us to move forward'' on many fronts.</p>
        <p>Like the governor, Mr. Rampe had earlier described the tunnel as the best buffer between highway traffic and a solemn memorial, but yesterday he said that transportation officials had been ''very good about ensuring that whatever would be done would be respectful of the memorial and the site.''</p>
