        <p>''HALSTON meets Studio 54 gone berserk, plus sleaze,'' said Dah Len, the photographer, describing the effect he tried to create in his design scheme for Movida, a Greenwich Village club he has fashioned into a luxury yacht. ''What happens in Movida stays in Movida,'' he added. ''Do you catch my drift?''</p>
        <p>The basement, the point of disembarkation, is submerged in the color aqua, from the walls to raftlike cushions, which hug the room like soft waves. Upstairs is the ship's deck. A crystal 1970's-era chandelier illuminates the dance floor. One Thursday night, against lights the shade of pink grapefruit, a large porthole-shape plasma screen displayed a psychedelic sunset, which Dah Len said would change seasonally.</p>

        <p>''HALSTON meets Studio 54 gone berserk, plus sleaze,'' said Dah Len, the photographer, describing the effect he tried to create in his design scheme for Movida, a Greenwich Village club he has fashioned into a luxury yacht. ''What happens in Movida stays in Movida,'' he added. ''Do you catch my drift?''</p>
        <p>The basement, the point of disembarkation, is submerged in the color aqua, from the walls to raftlike cushions, which hug the room like soft waves. Upstairs is the ship's deck. A crystal 1970's-era chandelier illuminates the dance floor. One Thursday night, against lights the shade of pink grapefruit, a large porthole-shape plasma screen displayed a psychedelic sunset, which Dah Len said would change seasonally.</p>
        <p>Overlooking the deck is the mezzanine, a V.I.P. room dark as night, with votive candles on tiny tables and pinhole lights dotted on the low ceiling. Under these constellations three women in their 20's spilled over the brass balcony, hooting and hollering to a a woman in capri-length jeans and a white shirt who had mounted the stripper pole, starboard of the D.J. booth. More Crunch cardio strip class than Stringfellows, she slid her long body up, down and around as cameras flashed. Dah Len's partners -- the D.J. Jason Swamy (Le Souk, Crobar) and the bar owner Johnny T (Niagara, Black &amp; White) -- had mixed a crowd of bankers, club kids and old-timers nostalgic for New York's wanton dance scene.</p>
        <p>Two bands, DFA and the Rapture, darlings of the hipster cognoscenti, were onboard, and their East Village and Williamsburg cohort followed.</p>
        <p>''I just bought a Red Stripe beer for $8, so I'm not sure how often I am going to come back,'' said Maxime Pasquier, 32, a D.J. who spins at Hiro, ''but I'd love to work here.''</p>
        <p>A blonde in a strappy silk shirt jiggled her torso toward a friend and sang, ''It's getting hot in heeere!'' Giggling ensued and a toast. ''I'm here for the hedonistic discovery,'' said the blonde, Lori Beth Katz, 23, a modern-dance performer from New Jersey. Her friend Rachel Haber, a Pilates instructor, also 23, leaned over to light her cigarette. ''That's what it said on the Web site.''</p>
        <p>Movida  28 Seventh Avenue South; (212)206-9600.</p>
        <p>GETTING IN -- Make friends with the owners.  DRESS CODE -- Anything goes, just don't look square.  D.J. PICKS -- Michael Jackson's ''Wanna Be Startin' Something,'' Talking Heads' ''Once in a Lifetime.''  SIGNATURE DRINK -- Monaco ''F.C. 7th Avenue'' (pineapple- and vanilla-bean-infused vodka, muddled pineapple, Chambord, Champagne), $12.</p>
