        <p>A plastic figure of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's in northern Lille over the weekend was discovered hanged beneath a city bridge with a ball and chain attached to one foot. The police said it remained unclear who stole the larger-than-life-size figure or why it was hanged. Though the fast-food chain remains popular with the French, it has often been the butt of criticism for its supposed role in debasing French cuisine. In 1999, a McDonald's under construction in southern Millau was bulldozed by José Bové, a radical rural leader.</p>
