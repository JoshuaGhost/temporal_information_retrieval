        <p>The judge in the Michael Jackson trial allowed two books of photographs of adolescent boys into evidence on Friday over the objection of Mr. Jackson's lawyers.</p>
        <p>The two large-format books, ''Boys Will Be Boys'' and ''The Boy: A Photographic Essay,'' were seized from a locked file cabinet in a closet in Mr. Jackson's bedroom at his Neverland ranch as part of a 1993 police investigation into accusations that he sexually molested a young boy.</p>
        <p>One of the Santa Barbara County prosecutors, Ronald J. Zonen, said the art books, which show boys playing, running and swimming in various states of undress, were evidence of Mr. Jackson's ''prurient interest in adolescent boys.''</p>
        <p>But one of Mr. Jackson's lawyers, Robert M. Sanger, countered that the books had no relevance to the current case and were highly prejudicial. ''It's just plain stale,'' Mr. Sanger said.</p>
        <p>He said the prosecution sought to show the books to the jury simply to bolster a weak case.</p>
        <p>The 1993 investigation was dropped after Mr. Jackson reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with his accuser. But it has formed the background for the current case, which is being directed by the same prosecutor, Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the Santa Barbara County district attorney, whose desire to prosecute Mr. Jackson was frustrated more than a decade ago. The current case involves a different accuser.</p>
        <p>Under California law, evidence of prior sexual misconduct can be introduced into evidence even if the earlier acts were not prosecuted or even reported to authorities.</p>
        <p>The two books were admitted under that section of California law, which allows evidence that a defendant has a propensity to engage in sexual molestation, even if never previously convicted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson is charged with molesting a 13-year-old recovering cancer patient at his ranch in February or March of 2003.</p>
        <p>One of books introduced today, ''The Boy,'' was apparently a gift from a fan, who inscribed the flyleaf with a heart and the words, ''From your fan, xxxooo, Rhonda.'' The notation ''1983 Chicago'' also appears on the page.</p>
        <p>The other, ''Boys Will Be Boys,'' contains the following note on the flyleaf: ''Look at the true spirit of happiness and joy in these boys' faces, this is the spirit of Boyhood. A life I never had and will always dream of. This is the life I want for my children.'' The note is signed ''MJ'' in what appears to be Mr. Jackson's hand.</p>
        <p>The books have been in police custody for the last 12 years.</p>
