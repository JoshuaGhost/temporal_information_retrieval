        <p>As NASA pushes toward returning the shuttle fleet to space, some current and former employees are questioning how serious the space agency is about fixing the ''broken safety culture'' that investigators have said was a major cause of the loss of the Columbia and its crew two years ago.</p>
        <p>''The culture has not changed at NASA,'' James D. Wetherbee, a former shuttle commander who recently served as a leading safety official at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said in an interview. ''I don't know how many times we have to have an accident to learn these lessons.''</p>

        <p>As NASA pushes toward returning the shuttle fleet to space, some current and former employees are questioning how serious the space agency is about fixing the ''broken safety culture'' that investigators have said was a major cause of the loss of the Columbia and its crew two years ago.</p>
        <p>''The culture has not changed at NASA,'' James D. Wetherbee, a former shuttle commander who recently served as a leading safety official at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said in an interview. ''I don't know how many times we have to have an accident to learn these lessons.''</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Wetherbee retired in January, he headed the shuttle side of the center's Independent Technical Authority, an organization dealing with technical and safety issues that was created at the recommendation of the panel investigating the Columbia accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wetherbee is one of a number of workers and officials who say the agency is doing too little to change the culture, though he is one of the few who is willing to speak for attribution. He first voiced his reservations about culture change in the space program last month to USA Today.</p>
        <p>Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say they are campaigning to change the agency's culture, and making significant progress. ''It's a totally different kind of philosophy than what was espoused before the accident,'' said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the deputy manager for the shuttle program.</p>
        <p>In the months after the Columbia disaster in February 2003, the space agency started several initiatives to enhance safety, including the creation of an Engineering and Safety Center at its Langley Research Center in Virginia. It has worked with Behavioral Science Technology, a company based in Ojai, Calif., to train managers and workers in effective communication and decision-making techniques. Behavioral Science Technology was also commissioned to conduct surveys of workers across the agency to measure their changing attitudes toward safety issues. In a report issued in February, Behavioral Science Technology said the agency was making ''solid progress'' toward that goal.</p>
        <p>The independent board that investigated the loss of Columbia called for 15 short-term ''return to flight'' recommendations to fix the problems that led to the fatal hole in the shuttle's wing. NASA officials say they are closing in on completion of all 15 and hope to fly again as early as May 15, though there are mounting indications that the mission may have to be delayed.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Wetherbee, the deeper cultural problem at NASA is the same one that has dogged the agency for decades: under pressure to stick to budget and schedule, managers suppress safety concerns from engineers and others who are closest to the equipment and the astronauts. Engineers' concerns about launching in cold weather were played down before the space shuttle Challenger was lost in 1986, and requests for greater attention to the insulating foam that struck the Columbia on liftoff in 2003 were repeatedly denied by mission managers.</p>
        <p>That has not changed, he said. Managers ''ask for dissenting opinions, because they know they are supposed to ask for them,'' but the managers ''are either defending their own position or arguing against the dissenting opinion'' without seriously trying to understand it, he said. The squelch can be as subtle as a manager's raised eyebrow, he said, but the pressures to fly are the same, with managers saying, ''They will close the doors to the space station if we don't get there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wetherbee said that even after the Columbia disaster, NASA's management did not see safety clearly, and he noted that the previous administrator, Sean O'Keefe, had spoken about how much risk was ''acceptable.''</p>
        <p>''That's the wrong question to be asking,'' Mr. Wetherbee said. ''The question we need to be asking is what risk is necessary, and how do we eliminate the unnecessary risk?''</p>
        <p>Dr. John Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said he found Mr. Wetherbee's comments ''worrisome.'' As a former shuttle commander, a senior official in the shuttle program and a trusted member of the space community, ''if someone like him does not know the character of the organization, who does?'' Dr. Logsdon said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Logsdon, a former member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, noted that it had set changing the culture of NASA as part of a set of long-term goals, and did not expect those fundamental changes to be accomplished before the space agency returned to flight. The board, he said, ''never thought it would happen very quickly, because the root of this is so deeply embedded.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Wetherbee, Dr. Logsdon expressed optimism that the newly appointed NASA chief, Michael Griffin, could bring change and strong leadership to the agency.</p>
        <p>The survey, performed at several NASA centers by Behavioral Science Technology, found that managers ''perceive actual change more than nonmanagers at this point.'' About 40 percent of managers in Kennedy Space Center's safety and mission assurance office who provided comments for the survey said the culture was improving. Among workers, only 8 percent said they saw change for the better. A worker at Johnson Space Center in Houston, quoted anonymously in the report, said, '' I have seen the managers who have created our current cultural problems 'dig their heels in' in order to do everything within their power to keep things from changing.''</p>
        <p>The president of Behavioral Science Technology, R. Scott Stricoff, said the agency was doing well. Mr. Stricoff said the dissenting voices that appeared in his company's surveys were to be expected. ''If we weren't seeing that, I would be suspicious -- I would think they were telling us what we wanted to hear,'' Mr. Stricoff said.</p>
        <p>An engineer who tried to raise warnings during the ill-fated Columbia flight and saw his efforts blunted by managers says that he has seen improvement. Rodney Rocha, who unsuccessfully tried to get NASA to ask for detailed images of Columbia by telescopes based on the ground and in space during the mission, said that his team now has better access to managers and greater comfort in raising concerns. ''We have a voice,'' Mr. Rocha said. ''Engineering is more independent than ever, more assertive than ever, and more in your face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale, the shuttle program official, said that he and other managers had worked hard at bringing about a culture change at the space agency, taking steps like putting a round table in the meeting room, setting up a suggestion box for anonymous notes, letting once-taut meeting schedules run on and pulling back from ''ops tempo,'' the fast pace that takes over during missions. ''Our meetings aren't half an hour long anymore,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The managers have taken classes to learn techniques of ''actively listening'' and now ''we really are convinced if we are going to avoid the next accident, we are going to have to pay attention to the concerns of the folks,'' he said. ''That is the only way we are going to avoid disaster.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Hale said, sometimes managers still slip; he saw one of his managers get ''a little irate, and said some things that would probably discourage people from talking to him.'' Mr. Hale pulled him aside for what he called a ''one-on-one counseling session'' about the incident, and he said that the manager realized his error. ''He said, 'Oh, my goodness, I know better than that,''' Mr. Hale recalled.</p>
        <p>That is real culture change, he said, because ''we were trained, lo these many years, to be tough.''</p>
