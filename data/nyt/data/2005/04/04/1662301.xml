        <p>Perseus Books Group, one of the largest independent publishers of general-interest books, is expected to announce today that it is acquiring Client Distribution Services, one of the industry's biggest providers of sales, distribution and back-office services to small publishers.</p>
        <p>Both companies are privately held, and terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Perseus, with annual sales of about $100 million, publishes under seven imprints, including Basic Books, Counterpoint and Da Capo Press.</p>
        <p>Client Distribution Services, whose majority owner is Olympus Partners, a private equity firm, provides services to more than 50 independent publishers including Harvard Business School Press, Taschen, Black Dog Publishing and Abbeville Press. Those publishers sell a total of about $200 million in books annually and Client Distribution Services is paid a percentage of those sales -- usually from 5 percent to 15 percent -- for its work.</p>
        <p>Perseus Books Group previously contracted out the distribution of its books to HarperCollins. David Steinberger, the president and chief executive of Perseus Books Group, said that the acquisition would allow it to increase profits more quickly.</p>
