        <p>Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating of General Motors' debt to Baa3, its lowest investment grade rating, and put the Ford Motor Company under review for a possible downgrade. Moody's now has Ford's debt rated Baa1, two grades above the new G.M. rating. Moody's also put G.M. on a negative outlook, suggesting a further downgrade to a junk bond rating is possible. The move brought Moody's rating of G.M.'s debt in line with the ratings of the other two major ratings firms, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch. The downgrade was prompted by G.M.'s announcement last month that it was scaling back its projections for earnings and cash flow for this year.</p>
