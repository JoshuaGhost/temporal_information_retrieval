        <p>Molly Pearson's first advertisement in the trade magazine Backstage read, ''Forming Theater Company: Seeking a small group of actors and actresses in their 20's '' She got more than 300 responses, but one, brimming with enthusiasm and almost painful sincerity, stuck out. ''I realize that your fledgling theater company is exactly what I've been looking for,'' Chad Beckim wrote, ''and I can offer you everything I have.''</p>
        <p>The two met for coffee in the East Village and ended up forming Partial Comfort Productions, adding to the scores of shoestring Off Off Broadway theater companies in New York that run on obsessive devotion, day jobs and nonstop pleas for donations.</p>
        <p>That was in 2001. Now, less than four years later, they have achieved what hundreds of people come to New York every year to do: make a mark on the city's fiercely competitive theater world. They managed to stage a new play -- '' A Matter of Choice,'' by Mr. Beckim, finished a three-week run this month at Chashama -- get mostly good reviews and have enough money left to do it all over again.</p>
        <p>That's the end of the story, but what about the beginning?</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Beckim, 31, and Ms. Pearson, 25, had long nursed theatrical ambitions. Ms. Pearson arrived in New York from Hartford in 1995 at 15, determined to make it as an actress. She attended the Professional Children's School with classmates like Macaulay Culkin and Christina Ricci, and then went to Los Angeles, but out there, she said, ''if I didn't do something different, I would be just another young blond girl in the crowd.'' So she moved back to New York.</p>
        <p>To stay afloat financially, she does makeup for head-shot photographers and builds Web sites when not auditioning. At a recent tryout in SoHo for a ''quirky angel'' to be in a Philadelphia Cream Cheese commercial, she had to consume enthusiastically a large quantity of cream cheese spread on Rice Krispie treats, even though she is lactose-intolerant. (She didn't get the job.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckim came to New York in 1997 to work as an actor after winning a talent show in Maine, his home state. He found regular work on ''All My Children'' and commuted by bus from Maine two or three days a week. He had no home base in New York, so for six months he slept in the Port Authority Bus Terminal or crashed on friends' floors; then a friend with whom he played basketball offered to share his home in Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckim moved in right away, sharing the apartment with nine others -- three generations of a Dominican family -- who treated him like one of their own. ''They gave me a curfew,'' he recalled. ''If I wasn't home on time, I'd get paged.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Beckim lives in Astoria, Queens, and works full time as an administrative assistant at J.P. Morgan, fervently resisting a promotion there, he said, so he will still have time to write plays and run the theater company.</p>
        <p>He based '' A Matter of Choice'' on his own experiences. The play examines the effect of the Second Avenue subway line's construction on three 20-something friends -- Diggs, who is white; Chastity, who is Latina; and Webb, who is gay and black -- sharing a Harlem apartment that is to be demolished for the project.</p>
        <p>Auditions began in January in a small rehearsal studio in the Flatiron district. A well-built, sleepy-eyed actor came to read for Diggs, wearing baggy jeans and a sleeveless white undershirt that revealed a tattoo of the letter D on his arm.</p>
        <p>''Is that real?'' asked the director, John Gould Rubin, wondering if it was an attempt to get into the character of Diggs. (It was real.) Then the actor read. Excellent, everyone agreed. His headshot went into the call-back pile.</p>
        <p>Then a reader for Webb came in. During the audition, Mr. Rubin suggested that the actor invest his reading with more anger.</p>
        <p>''He has the persona,'' Mr. Rubin said after the actor left, ''but he doesn't know how to act. He didn't take my notes.'' The head shot went into the ''No'' pile.</p>
        <p>At 54, Mr. Rubin doesn't quite fit the mold of the young upstart. He is on the board of directors of the LAByrinth Theater Company, for which he produced ''Our Lady of 121st Street,'' ''Dirty Story'' and ''Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train.''</p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe John would do this and asked him why he would want to be a part of such a small show when he was doing this kind of work 30 years ago,'' Ms. Pearson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin explained: ''I'm attracted to them because they're really driven to do good work. Chad's play was in rough shape when I signed on, but that's the point. If I turn it down on those grounds, then it's like being fresh out of drama school and turning down work because it's not up to your standards. There's no money in theater, so your rewards have to be intrinsic.''</p>
        <p>Once the cast was in place, Ms. Pearson, Mr. Beckim and Mr. Rubin could finally start thinking about a design for the space they had been negotiating for all winter: a converted dress shop on West 37th Street, one of the theater spaces run by the arts organization Chashama.</p>
        <p>One Thursday morning in mid-February, Ms. Pearson, Mr. Rubin and the show's designer, Lex Liang, showed up at the space, coffee in hand, for a walk-through.</p>
        <p>''Uh, I don't remember this being here,'' Ms. Pearson said, fingering a four-foot hole in the wall. Meanwhile, Mr. Liang was measuring every inch of the space and taking digital photos.</p>
        <p>A week later, Mr. Beckim and Ms. Pearson, tired and fidgety, arrived at Ron Lasko's small Lower East Side apartment and publicity office.</p>
        <p>''You really need to take pictures right away,'' Mr. Lasko said. ''Want to hear something awful? American Theater wanted to put 'Play' on the cover,'' he said, referring to one of their previous productions, ''but your pictures weren't good enough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pearson looked as if she were about to cry.</p>
        <p>With three weeks before opening, and four or five rehearsals a week, things were finally going well. Many of the actors were no longer using scripts; they had all the moves down for the fight scene. ''Sometimes it feels like Chad and I have been married since 2001, and the company is our kids,'' Ms. Pearson said. ''My boyfriend's a little sick of it.''</p>
        <p>Then, on the last day of February, one of the show's stars, Maduka Steady, who played Webb, quit the show to take a movie deal.</p>
        <p>''He called me at 10:30 at night and said, 'We need to talk,''' Mr. Beckim recalled. ''I panicked,'' he said, after cursing heavily. Luckily, the company's second choice for the role, Nyambi Nyambi, was available. Crisis averted.</p>
        <p>Then, just a week before the first preview, the sound designer quit. It's some consolation to the group that she might have trouble finding more work. ''I'm not saying Rubin is the Godfather,'' Mr. Beckim said, ''but he knows a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>Then, at last, opening night: Friday, March 24. As friends and families lined up, Mr. Beckim looked as if he would explode.</p>
        <p>The show went off without a hitch. An hour and 45 minutes later it was done. The audience whooped.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the cast headed downtown to Club Discotheque on West 19th Street and made its way through the dancing throngs to a curtained back room. One company member handed out white roses. Several others moved aside tables and started dancing. There was elation, but also wary speculation about the reviews. A good review from a major publication could mean a sell-out run and more donations; a bad one could endanger a new company's future. As it was, the show had cost $15,000, half of Partial Comfort Productions' annual budget.</p>
        <p>The following Monday, Andrea Stevens, reviewing '' A Matter of Choice'' for The New York Times, took issue with the length and some of the production design but called the play ''frequently compelling'' and singled out several actors for praise.</p>
        <p>''I'm actually quite surprised that this was so favorable,'' a giddy Mr. Beckim said the morning the review appeared. Some theater stars, like Wendy Wasserstein, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Sigourney Weaver came. Mr. Beckim and Ms. Pearson hoped for an extension, or even a transfer to Off Broadway. But they didn't have the finances, so the show closed April 9 as planned.</p>
        <p>Since the play closed, Mr. Beckim has received praise from heroes of his like John Patrick Shanley, a friend of Mr. Rubin's and the winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for drama for his play ''Doubt. '' Mr. Beckim said he had received calls from ''the strangest people, agents, commercial producers.''</p>
        <p>''It's quite flattering,'' he added. ''And frightening.''</p>
        <p>Now, though, Mr. Beckim said he was going through ''a major depression,'' caused by the end of the run.</p>
        <p>But it's time to move on. Casting for ''Bigger Man,'' by Sam Marks, a company member, starts in mid-May; rehearsals begin in June.</p>
        <p>''The to-do list is a mile long,'' Mr. Beckim said. ''It's a blessing.''</p>
