        <p>IT has to have been a bewildering few weeks for Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group. One minute his company is producing record revenues and he is high-fiving himself on Congress's passage of tort reform, one of his passions. The next minute he is dumped from the company he has run for almost 40 years and finds himself facing an under-oath interview with prosecutors from the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general's office, the same guys he used to bully on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>IT has to have been a bewildering few weeks for Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group. One minute his company is producing record revenues and he is high-fiving himself on Congress's passage of tort reform, one of his passions. The next minute he is dumped from the company he has run for almost 40 years and finds himself facing an under-oath interview with prosecutors from the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general's office, the same guys he used to bully on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>You almost feel sorry for the man. Exalted for so long, he forgot what it was like to be questioned.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to get inside someone else's head, of course, but one of the most puzzling aspects of Mr. Greenberg's downfall, to him at least, might have been the role his 10 outside directors played in it. The people who ultimately pushed him from power were, after all, his hand-picked colleagues, people who had been with him, in some cases, for more than a decade. Many of them were also people he encountered in other high-powered orbits, and he donated generously to their favorite causes.</p>
        <p>A.I.G.'s directors include M. Bernard Aidinoff, retired partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell; Pei-yuan Chia, retired vice chairman of Citicorp; Marshall A. Cohen, former chief executive of the Molson Companies, a Canadian brewer; William S. Cohen, the former senator and secretary of defense; Martin S. Feldstein, the Harvard economist who is mentioned as a possible successor to Alan Greenspan.</p>
        <p>Joining those five luminaries are Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History in New York; Carla A. Hills, former United States trade representative; Frank J. Hoenemeyer, retired vice chairman of the Prudential Insurance Company of America; Richard C. Holbrooke, former ambassador to the United Nations; and Frank G. Zarb, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and senior adviser to Hellman &amp; Friedman, a private investment firm.</p>
        <p>Clearly a star-studded board.</p>
        <p>And a collegial one, too. Besides their common interests in the workings of A.I.G., many of the outside directors also share Mr. Greenberg's interest in world affairs. Half are directors or members with Mr. Greenberg at the Council on Foreign Relations, an independent policy group.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Greenberg connected with many of his outside directors in another way: by making big donations through the Starr Foundation, a nonprofit organization he controls, to institutions that some A.I.G. directors led or belonged to.</p>
        <p>Contributions to such outfits surpassed $44 million from 1998 to 2003, the most recent figures available. (The information for 1999 was incomplete.) This is a sizable sum, to be sure. Still, it is less than 5 percent of the donations that Starr has made during the five years for which public figures are available.</p>
        <p>The Starr Foundation was created by C.V. Starr, the founder of A.I.G., in his will. According to the most recent filing, it had roughly $3.6 billion in assets, mostly in A.I.G. shares. It is a major contributor to education: 34 percent of the $190 million it distributed in 2003 went to academic scholarships. The rest went to cultural and charitable institutions like Carnegie Hall, the Children's Aid Society and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. It also made donations to New York Times Company Foundation projects.</p>
        <p>Florence A. Davis is president of the Starr foundation, but Mr. Greenberg is its chairman and, according to the filing, devotes 200 hours a year to its business. Ms. Davis did not return a phone call seeking comment. Mr. Greenberg, through his lawyer, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest recipients of Starr funds is the Asia Society, which aims to educate Americans about Asia. In 2003, Starr paid $2.6 million to the society, of which Mr. Greenberg is a trustee. Mr. Holbrooke is both a trustee and the chairman of the society's executive committee.</p>
        <p>Large contributions -- more than $26 million -- have also gone to the American Museum of Natural History, where Ms. Futter is president. The foundation gave the museum $1 million in 1998; Ms. Futter joined the A.I.G. board the next year. In 2000, Starr contributed $100,000, but it gave an astounding $25.1 million in 2001. An additional $100,000 came the museum's way in 2003.</p>
        <p>Groups that Ms. Hills has been associated with have also received considerable donations from Starr. The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations received a total of $1.85 million during the period, while the Institute for International Economics got $3.2 million. The Trilateral Commission received $120,000.</p>
        <p>The Brookings Institution, which counts Mr. Aidinoff as a council member, received $1.95 million from Starr during the period. And the Council on Foreign Relations received almost $7 million.</p>
        <p>THEN there is Mr. Feldstein's National Bureau of Economic Research, which has received about $3 million since 1998. The William S. Cohen Center for International Policy and Commerce, at the University of Maine, received a total of $1 million in 1999 and 2000, four years before Mr. Cohen joined the A.I.G. board.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Frank G. Zarb School of Business at Hofstra University took in $675,000 in 2003; Mr. Zarb joined the A.I.G board in 2001.</p>
        <p>Chris Winans, an A.I.G. spokesman, said, ''The board's decisive actions have demonstrated its strong independence.'' He added that Mr. Zarb had no knowledge of any donations that the Starr Foundation made to the Frank G. Zarb School of Business since Mr. Zarb joined the A.I.G. board. None of the other independent directors who are connected to groups that received Starr donations would comment.</p>
        <p>A.I.G., in its most recent proxy statement, says directors can be considered independent as long as contributions to the nonprofit organization they run do not exceed $1 million or 2 percent of the charitable organization's gross revenues for the most recent year.</p>
        <p>The donations to Mr. Feldstein's National Bureau of Economic Research did exceed those amounts. But the proxy said the board, on the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, had determined that the contributions did not ''impair'' his independence. The proxy also said Mr. Feldstein had advised the committee that there was ''no present intention to seek additional funding for the bureau from the Starr Foundation.''</p>
        <p>Did the foundation's contributions to the directors' favored organizations influence them as the recent crisis unfolded at A.I.G.? None of the directors would comment on that.</p>
        <p>Still, human nature being what it is, the contributions could not possibly have made the directors' decision to defenestrate Mr. Greenberg any easier.</p>
        <p>The Starr Foundation is clearly doing crucial work in the arts, medicine and education. But shareholders have a right to wonder if all those donations to the directors' favorite charities are clouding their judgment.</p>
