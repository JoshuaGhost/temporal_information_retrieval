        <p>There's a warm and fuzzy name for many of those deliberate, violent and thrilling collisions that happen almost routinely each week at racetracks throughout the Nascar circuit.</p>
        <p>It's called bumping -- or rubbing bumpers -- as if something that gentle could possibly occur when a driver uses his car to move an opponent out of the way at dangerously high speeds. Fans, by the way, figure to see plenty of rubbing Sunday during the Advance Auto Parts 500 Nextel Cup race at Martinsville Speedway.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, what we do is competitive, and what we do is exciting to watch, and what we do borders on craziness, and that's why it's fun to watch,'' the driver Jeff Burton said Friday before practice and qualifying at Martinsville.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Nascar has made a living off of the confrontations that occur weekly on racetracks. Dale Earnhardt was equally revered and despised because he was an expert practitioner. Robin Pemberton, a longtime crew chief who is now Nascar's vice president of competition, boasted of the bump, ''We are proud of it.''</p>
        <p>But it seems to be happening more often these days -- more bumps and more wrecks and more angry drivers at the end of race day. At Bristol Motor Speedway, a short track where cars are bunched and tensions always run a little higher, Burton was the victim of a bump by the points leader Jimmie Johnson last Sunday during the Food City 500. The result: Burton spun out of control and was hit head-on by the defending Cup champion Kurt Busch. Burton and Busch were each done for the day.</p>
        <p>The collision between Busch and Burton was so violent that Busch, noticeably shaken after leaving his racecar, visited a doctor days later to make sure his neck was not injured. Burton wasn't hurt, but he was so furious that he got out of his racecar and pointed angrily to Johnson as Johnson drove by.</p>
        <p>There were nine wrecks last Sunday. Of course, that was nothing compared to the confrontation a day later in the Busch Series race at Bristol; there were a track-record 14 cautions over 250 laps.</p>
        <p>After a late crash between the veteran Dale Jarrett, a former Cup champion, and the young Shane Hmiel on Monday, an in-car camera caught Hmiel motioning with an obscene hand gesture, not an uncommon sight in Nascar. Hmiel, who had bumped Jarrett, was penalized 25 points and fined $10,000.</p>
        <p>Tensions usually don't ease at Martinsville, yet another short track where wrecks are common. Nascar has put races at Bristol and Martinsville back to back in a quirk of scheduling that could lead to some retaliation Sunday.</p>
        <p>But no matter where the races are, bumping is on the rise, according to drivers. That's because competition is tougher than it used to be.</p>
        <p>''If you want to talk about how close the cars are, how competitive they are, put 43 cars at Bristol, separate them by three-tenths of a second, you're going to have wrecks,'' Burton said. ''There's no way around it.</p>
        <p>''Look at the teams from 1st to 35th, 36th, 37th, 38th -- there's no junk cars in there. It's all good cars with good drivers, and that creates competitiveness on the track. That creates the wrecks.''</p>
        <p>So does youth. Nascar is full of young drivers who haven't learned the art of bumping -- doing it without wrecking the car in front of you.</p>
        <p>''That is a technique that you have to work on,'' Pemberton said. ''Some come by it naturally, some are forever trying to hone their craft and some will never get it.''</p>
        <p>And perhaps there are some who believe they don't need to hone it. The four-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon said drivers feel safer than they have ever been in race cars. Could it be that they are crashing more because they feel impervious to the result?</p>
        <p>''I think there's some that drive like that,'' the driver Ryan Newman said.</p>
        <p>At some racetracks where passing is difficult, bumping is the preferred method of moving ahead of the car in front.</p>
        <p>As the four-time champion Gordon said, sometimes it's the only way to get ahead.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, you don't want to have to bump anybody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's only when you go to a racetrack that you can't pass on. If you're faster than the guy in front of you and it's a one-groove racetrack like here at Martinsville and Bristol, you get to that point where, 'O.K., I've tried everything that I can; I'm faster than this car.' My only other option is to hit him.''</p>
        <p>The key is where drivers bump their opponents. If it happens in a corner, instead of a straightaway, a crash is probably imminent.</p>
        <p>''From restaurants to real estate and racing,'' Pemberton said, ''location is everything.''</p>
        <p>At superspeedways like Daytona, bump-drafting at 190 miles an hour is a common practice. It was a Johnson bump, in fact, that led to Gordon's victory in the Daytona 500 in February. Johnson essentially rammed his car into Gordon's back bumper, propelling Gordon past Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the latter stages of the race.</p>
        <p>''I don't necessarily agree with it there, either,'' Gordon said of the bump draft. ''None of us wants to do that. But that's the nature of the draft and the nature of a track that you can't pass on, period. And Daytona's a track you can't pass on.''</p>
        <p>So is Martinsville, a one-groove track where drivers will play bumper cars for 500 laps Sunday. Wrecks to follow.</p>
        <p>As Burton said, ''Would ya'll want it any other way?''</p>
