        <p>LEAVE the house before dawn on Fridays to beat the weekend traffic. Bring a clear plastic purse for personal items and lots of quarters for the vending machines. Do not take pat-downs or surly guards personally. And never, ever say loudly that the person you are visiting is thrilled to be there, lest the people in charge conclude he isn't paying his debt to society and ship him farther from home.</p>
        <p>Such is the advice for Patricia Rowland from people whose friends and relatives were transferred to out-of-state prisons while her husband, John, was governor.</p>
        <p>As a tough, law-and-order Republican governor, Mr. Rowland had supported the transfers as a ''good deal'' for Connecticut because they saved money, eased overcrowding and thwarted gangs, and he pushed to include as many as 2,000 inmates in the program, up from the 500 initially allotted in 1999.</p>
        <p>But as a fallen public official facing sentencing last month for conspiracy, he lobbied to be assigned to a prison in Ayer, Mass., roughly 90 minutes from his home in West Hartford. While the sentencing judge, Peter C. Dorsey, supported the recommendation, the federal Bureau of Prisons, weighing many factors, placed him instead at a minimum-security camp in Loretto, Pa., about 90 miles east of Pittsburgh and nearly 400 miles from where his wife and children live, a seven-hour drive.</p>
        <p>Interviewed in the past week, friends and relatives of people who had been in state custody under Mr. Rowland said it was not lost on them that it was Mrs. Rowland's turn to experience the strain and hardship distant assignments place on prisoners' support systems back home.</p>
        <p>''It's fair he's far away,'' said Sally Joughin, one of the organizers of People Against Injustice, an advocacy group. ''He can find out that maybe it isn't such a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Her group favors more liberal use of alternatives to incarceration and provides support for inmates' families. Mr. Rowland pleaded guilty in federal court in December to one felony count of having abused his office, and was sentenced last month to a year and a day in prison. It was a given that any term would be served outside Connecticut because the only federal facility in the state, in Danbury, serves only women. Still, few, including the sentencing judge, expected Mr. Rowland to be assigned to western Pennsylvania, just within the Bureau of Prisons policy of keeping inmates when possible within 500 miles of their homes.</p>
        <p>Anne McNamara, a Stamford office worker, said she could imagine what Mrs. Rowland's weekends will now be like. For nearly four years, every chance she got, Ms. McNamara said she drove or took the bus to Jarrett, Va., where her son was serving a sentence imposed on him in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''It's exhausting,'' she said of trips that took her 10 to 12 hours each way. She had to ask her boss for Fridays off so she could hit the road by 4:30 a.m. Many weekends cost her $300 just for hotels and gas. She considered herself fortunate when she made it back to Connecticut by midnight on Sunday and got some sleep before the work week began.</p>
        <p>Her son was returned to a state-run facility last fall after Mr. Rowland's successor, Gov. M. Jodi Rell, decided one month after taking office in July to end the practice of exporting prisoners to other state prisons. She also promised to repatriate all 428 out-of-state prisoners, then housed in Virginia under contract.</p>
        <p>''This approach is in the best interests of the inmates, their families and our correction system,'' Mrs. Rell said. ''It will keep offenders closer to their families, their communities and to the support that is so critical for their successful reintegration into society.''</p>
        <p>Inmates' families said they are grateful to Mrs. Rell for having acted so quickly.</p>
        <p>In his section of Loretto, Mr. Rowland is allowed four visits per month, but guests who return twice in one weekend count as two visits. Food cannot be brought in, but can be purchased from vending machines. Handholding during visits must be in plain sight. Mr. Rowland is also allowed 300 minutes of collect phone calls a month, but inmates' families warn that talk isn't cheap: 15 minutes can cost $10.</p>
        <p>Though she once lived in the governor's mansion surrounded by help, Mrs. Rowland should ''try to be one of the crowd,'' said Larry Fassler, the author of ''Busted by the Feds: A Manual for Defendants Facing Federal Prosecution.''</p>
        <p>''Don't put on airs,'' said Mr. Fassler, a former inmate. ''Don't drop names. Don't expect special consideration. They'll know who she is, and if they are going to give her special consideration, they'll do it on their own. But if she seems to be acting like she's entitled to it, they'll have a negative reaction.''</p>
        <p>Shelley Stellmacher of Waterbury said she hoped Mrs. Rowland's marriage fared better than her own.</p>
        <p>''Being in prison is one thing, but to be so many miles away is very disheartening,'' said Ms. Stellmacher, who ran up huge bills visiting and calling her husband, Russell, while he was incarcerated in Virginia. He, too, was recently relocated to a facility in Connecticut, but the move came too late to save her marriage. The distance, ''puts a real strain on marriages,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On friendships, too. Robert M. Casale, the defense lawyer who represented Mrs. Rowland in the state and federal investigations that drove her husband from office, said he ''was going to run up and see him in Fort Devens,'' referring to Mr. Rowland's first-choice assignment in Ayer, Mass. ''But sticking him in western Pennsylvania makes it a little inconvenient.''</p>
        <p>He said he would not be surprised if the time behind bars turned ''a conservative law-and-order governor'' into ''a bit of a liberal.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Fair of West Haven, an official of People Against Injustice who was active in criminal-justice reform even before her own son was sent to a Virginia prison, said she predicted long ago that Mr. Rowland would someday rue taking a hard line on crime. She recalled being ignored by Mr. Rowland once when she tried to give him one of her fliers near his office in the Capitol. At which point, she said, she yelled, ''You'll appreciate this when you're sitting behind bars.''</p>
