        <p>American Ecology will ask its shareholders to approve a new director next month. The company, which cleans up radioactive and other hazardous wastes, notes his close relationship with the federal government, a big customer. Stephen A. Romano, American Ecology's chief executive, added that the new director would bring ''valuable ethics and oversight perspective'' to the company.</p>
        <p>Left unsaid was that the nominee, Richard T. Swope, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, is one of eight officers who were criticized by the Air Force inspector general, who said that they could have done more to stop sexual abuse of female cadets at the Air Force Academy in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for General Swope, the acting Air Force secretary, Peter B. Teets, concluded -- in a memo to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, three days before Mr. Teets retired on March 24 -- that disciplinary action against the officers was ''not warranted.''</p>
        <p>Senator Wayne Allard, a Colorado Republican, disclosed the decision on March 28, calling it ''inexcusable.'' The company announced the general's nomination two days later. It declined to discuss the timing of its decision.</p>
