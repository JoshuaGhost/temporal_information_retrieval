        <p>One might have thought Richard Meier would be reluctant to return to the site, given that the two $50 million glass-and-steel apartment towers he designed on Perry Street and West Street overlooking the Hudson River had attracted so much negative publicity. Celebrity watchers had reveled in reports of leaks, construction delays and other problems that inconvenienced rich and famous tenants like Nicole Kidman, Calvin Klein and Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Meier was undaunted, having now designed another glass condominium building next door, at 165 Charles Street, to be completed in October. Striding through the construction site in the West Village the other day, his white hair flowing out beneath his hard hat, dust coating the trim of his black trench coat, he seemed anything but chastened as he surveyed his new 16-story transparent tower.</p>

        <p>One might have thought Richard Meier would be reluctant to return to the site, given that the two $50 million glass-and-steel apartment towers he designed on Perry Street and West Street overlooking the Hudson River had attracted so much negative publicity. Celebrity watchers had reveled in reports of leaks, construction delays and other problems that inconvenienced rich and famous tenants like Nicole Kidman, Calvin Klein and Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Meier was undaunted, having now designed another glass condominium building next door, at 165 Charles Street, to be completed in October. Striding through the construction site in the West Village the other day, his white hair flowing out beneath his hard hat, dust coating the trim of his black trench coat, he seemed anything but chastened as he surveyed his new 16-story transparent tower.</p>
        <p>''I love being here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the Perry Street experience was exasperating, Mr. Meier said, but it taught him an important lesson: how crucial it is to have greater control over the construction and the interior design of his projects.</p>
        <p>Buildings usually go through value engineering, for example, when a consulting architect comes in to suggest how things could be done for less. Not 165 Charles Street. ''I've been through that,'' he said. ''I know what that does. In the end, it compromises everything.''</p>
        <p>And typically, details inside apartment buildings are handled by interior designers, not the architects themselves, who do not usually get involved with finishes, fittings and fixtures.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the developers of Charles Street were willing to oblige Mr. Meier, the celebrated architect whose projects include the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, the Jubilee Church in Rome and the Manhattan restaurant 66.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier has taken a similar hands-on approach to a residential building he is designing in Brooklyn on Grand Army Plaza overlooking Prospect Park. The 30-story condominium includes 120 units, most of which have balconies with park views.</p>
        <p>Because there was no value engineering at Charles Street, banks would finance only about 60 percent of the $90 million building, rather than the standard 80 to 90 percent. ''It could have saved me a lot of money,'' said Izak Senbahar, one of the developers, but he chose not to cut any corners. ''I thought it was a better decision to just go for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier designed the interior of all 31 apartments himself, as well as the building's 50-foot pool with waterfall, 35-seat screening room, wine cellar and fitness center. The developers also paid handsomely for every architectural detail. There are no baseboards; instead the walls float one-quarter inch off the floors like those at the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art -- with the same crew doing the installation. The nine-foot-tall bathroom doors, made of opaque glass, were $6,500 each. The African wenge wood floors are being put down by the same team responsible for the Getty's flooring. There is humidity control for people with art collections.</p>
        <p>At the Perry Street towers, developed by Richard Born and his partners and opened two years ago, the apartments were delivered as raw space for tenants to configure with their own designers.</p>
        <p>At Charles Street, Mr. Meier has had uncommon leeway in keeping tabs on construction. ''We have given the architect the right to come in more often to the job site and make sure it is all happening according to plan,'' Mr. Senbahar said. ''The usual deal is, they design it, you build it,'' he added. ''But we have gone the extra distance to give Richard what he wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier said he hoped his Charles Street experience would be instructive for the many other architects who have turned their attention to residential buildings in New York.</p>
        <p>Steven Holl, Zaha Hadid, Santiago Calatrava, Frank Gehry, Christian de Portzamparc, Richard Rogers, Architectonica, Norman Foster, Enrique Norten, Robert A.M. Stern, Charles Gwathmey, Jean Nouvel, Tsao &amp; McKown, Winka Dubbeldam, Herzog &amp; de Meuron and Michael Graves are just some of those designing residential towers in New York.</p>
        <p>Louise M. Sunshine, the chairwoman and chief executive of the Sunshine Group, which is marketing Charles Street, said great architecture could add $400 to $1,000 per square foot in value to the purchase price. Charles Street is 60 percent sold, she said, at prices ranging from $3 million to $20 million.</p>
        <p>Celebrity architects have also become a selling point. ''It gives the building a certain cachet,'' said Deborah Grubman, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, a real estate company that has sold some of the Meier apartments. ''It's like having a signed painting.''</p>
        <p>But it is not as if Mr. Meier was some petulant artist asking for the moon, Mr. Senbahar said. ''He's built churches in Rome and museums in Barcelona,'' Mr. Senbahar said. ''He's a reasonable man.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, economics still rule. ''You can say, 'The architect should be able to do more,''' Mr. Meier said. ''But if the developer is not willing to spend the money, you have very little power.''</p>
        <p>When the architect Bernard Tschumi designed his new blue glass tower for the Lower East Side, for example, he had to shape the building to get the maximum space and still meet strict zoning regulations. ''The developer wants to get every square foot,'' he said. ''In New York, it seems to be strictly business.''</p>
        <p>The rewards, however, are heady: these architects are changing the New York skyline. Pass by the Meier buildings at night along the West Side Highway or from the Hudson River and you can't help but notice.</p>
        <p>As a New Jersey native who has lived in New York City all his adult life, Mr. Meier takes pride in this. ''It's like Rockefeller Center,'' he said. ''It makes a place in the city.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 14, 2005, Thursday  An article in The Arts on Monday about the architect Richard Meier and his hands-on approach to projects included outdated information provided by his firm about a residential building he is designing on Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn. It will be 15 stories, not 30.</p>
