        <p>Muslim Cleric Found GuiltyIn 'Virginia Jihad' Network  In the most significant case involving what prosecutors have dubbed the Virginia jihad network, an American-born Muslim cleric was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the United States just days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>

        <p>DNA Leads to Suspect In 25 Unsolved Rape Cases  A forgotten piece of evidence in a rape case from more than 30 years ago -- a pair of woman's underpants -- has led to the DNA identification of a suspect in at least 24 other rapes and sexual assaults stretching from New York to Maryland, authorities said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Death From Legionnaires'  NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, which said just days ago that a patient's death last month had not been caused by Legionnaires' disease, reversed itself, saying that an autopsy showed that the disease had indeed led to the death.</p>
