        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You call on Congress to re-examine its decision to allow the marketing of DHEA, a natural anti-aging supplement that has been safely marketed for decades (''Muscle Flexing in Congress,'' editorial, April 20).</p>
        <p>You did not mention one critical fact: Congress has already given the Drug Enforcement Administration the authority to schedule DHEA as a controlled substance.</p>
        <p>The same law that exempted DHEA based on its past history of beneficial use -- and lack of evidence of abuse -- also changed the criteria for adding to the controlled-substances list.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden, the law's lead sponsor, and I also agreed that if DHEA becomes an abuse problem and the D.E.A. fails to use this authority, we would change the law to protect the public health.</p>
        <p>We agreed that Congress should not restrict access to a product that has given health and vigor to millions. Instead, we should monitor its use and act promptly if the need arises.</p>
        <p>Orrin G. Hatch  U.S. Senator from Utah  Washington, April 25, 2005</p>
