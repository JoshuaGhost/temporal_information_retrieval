        <p>A cloned horse, the world's second, was born in February and is now 50 days old, said Cryozootech, the French company that created it. The foal is the clone of Pieraz, a gelding that was twice the world endurance champion in the 1990's. Pieraz is now in retirement in the United States with his owner, Valerie Kanavy. His little cloned self, called Pieraz-Cryozootech-Stallion, is intended to pass on the champion's traits rather than compete himself.</p>
