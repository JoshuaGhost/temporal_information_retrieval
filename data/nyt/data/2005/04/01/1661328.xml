        <p>''You must provide for your own existence.'' That's how the park service greets campers at Dry Tortugas National Park, an outpost of Florida 70 miles from Key West in the Gulf of Mexico. And for those who go to pitch their tents, it is probably part of the attraction.</p>
        <p>The Tortugas, eight remote islands shaded by the occasional palm tree and surrounded by coral reefs, attract about 70,000 people a year, but the usual visitor takes a day trip -- typically a package including high-speed ferry service from Key West, snorkel gear and a tour of Fort Jefferson, the derelict brick hexagon that dominates Garden Key, the 16-acre main island. At the end of the day, only a few visitors remain for an overnight stay at the park.</p>

        <p>''You must provide for your own existence.'' That's how the park service greets campers at Dry Tortugas National Park, an outpost of Florida 70 miles from Key West in the Gulf of Mexico. And for those who go to pitch their tents, it is probably part of the attraction.</p>
        <p>The Tortugas, eight remote islands shaded by the occasional palm tree and surrounded by coral reefs, attract about 70,000 people a year, but the usual visitor takes a day trip -- typically a package including high-speed ferry service from Key West, snorkel gear and a tour of Fort Jefferson, the derelict brick hexagon that dominates Garden Key, the 16-acre main island. At the end of the day, only a few visitors remain for an overnight stay at the park.</p>
        <p>Game for the more challenging experience, I watched from the coarse, coral sand beach a few weeks ago as the ferry I had ridden to the key shuddered at the dock and pulled away, leaving me and several fellow castaways behind.</p>
        <p>The park service allows primitive camping on Garden Key for $3 a night. The campers provide for their existence by bringing along food, charcoal for fires and drinking water (the Tortugas truly are dry). They pitch their tents on the sandy strip between the moat and the old coaling dock on the south side of the key. A few park rangers live on the island full time, in apartments inside the fort, but for the most part, campers are on their own. Once the ferries and seaplanes are gone, the Tortugas feel like what they are, a few slabs of sand tossed up by the sea.</p>
        <p>Historically, hidden shoals made the surrounding waters a graveyard for ships, including a fleet of galleons in 1622, carrying New World gold and silver, and the lack of fresh water kept out any settlers. The remoteness made the islands a logical place for pirate hideouts -- buried treasure is said to have been found on East Key in the 19th century -- and later, for the American version of Devil's Island. Now the isolation attracts campers looking for a few days beyond the horizon and the grid.</p>
        <p>ASIDE from the fort, the only structure that breaks the horizon is a lighthouse on 48-acre Loggerhead Key, the largest of the Tortugas, which rises above wind-ravaged palms reminiscent of ornaments in a plastic turtle aquarium. Visible for miles, the light is a beacon for Cuban refugees, who make for it in their makeshift craft. Each year, hundreds of immigrants reach the Tortugas, the southernmost outpost of the continental United States.</p>
        <p>Even before the Castro regime, Cubans were attracted to the Tortugas, which were rich in turtles, seabird eggs and fish. So were sport fishermen. It was in the Tortugas that Ernest Hemingway first met Gregorio Fuentes, the inspiration for the fisherman in ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' when both had been out fishing and were marooned there in a storm. (Mr. Fuentes himself told the story decades later, well after his years as the captain of Hemingway's Cuba-based fishing boat.) I hadn't come to fish, but I was interested in the marine life around the islands, now shielded in part of a great experiment to protect the sea around Florida. Since my last trip to the Keys on a research cruise in the 1990's, 151 square nautical miles of ocean around the islands have been designated as the Tortugas Ecological Reserve, a ''no-take'' zone: no nets, no traps, no trawls, no hooks or lines.</p>
        <p>On my first morning on Garden Key, I slipped into the clear, chilly water while the fort was still spilling long shadows over the sea. A stoplight parrotfish grazed on the bricks, feeding on algae, and several transparent pipefish hugged the moat walls. It was good to see several long-spined sea urchins, which had been devastated by disease in recent years, reducing populations by more than 95 percent around Florida. These well-armored echinoderms help maintain reefs by consuming fast-growing algae that can overgrow corals. According to one study, the loss of herbivores like these, through disease or overfishing, can be more devastating to a reef than a hurricane can.</p>
        <p>There is evidence that the no-take experiment is working: snappers and black grouper are more common than they were six years ago, before its creation, and life on the sea floor is thriving after years of being clawed by commercial trawlers.</p>
        <p>I swam to the nearby reef, an invertebrate hot spot of corals, sea stars, plume worms, urchins and sea whips. A huge jewfish peered out between the brain coral, and over my shoulder a three-foot barracuda followed me with a quizzical scowl.</p>
        <p>In the abandoned coal docks along the harbor, a tight school of 60 or so bluestriped grunts swayed in the current, like palm fronds in the breeze. I came face to face with a doe-eyed porcupinefish. Rather than defend itself by inflating into a beachball with spines, it took the easy way out and retreated behind a pylon. I looked up. Two terns and a pelican peered down at me, as if to ask, ''And who do you think you are?''</p>
        <p>When the Spanish explorer Ponce de León came upon these islands in 1513, he named them for the numerous turtles, or tortugas, nesting there. Because turtles could be kept alive onboard for months, the Tortugas became an important stopover for fresh meat and eggs. ''The turtle nests were just ravaged,'' Mike Ryan, a park ranger, said. ''By the 1880's and 1890's, there were fewer than a dozen nests annually in the Dry Tortugas.'' Since the park service took over, things have become much better: last year the service counted more than 100 loggerhead and 59 green-turtle nests and three leatherback turtles -- the eight-foot giants of the turtle world -- nested on the islands for the first time since studies began. In 1846, the Army began building Fort Jefferson to guard the shipping lane between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico; during the Civil War, the fort helped obstruct Confederate shipping and served as a Union supply depot. Later the fort became an isolated island prison, like France's Devil's Island, though never so notorious. Dr. Samuel Mudd, sent there for setting John Wilkes Booth's leg after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, helped out in a yellow fever epidemic and was pardoned and released by President Andrew Johnson.</p>
        <p>After the development of artillery that could fire shells through thick brick walls, the Army abandoned the fort, which probably didn't break any soldiers' hearts. Cisterns built to catch rainwater had inevitably filled up with seawater; small pox, typhoid and heat stroke had taken many lives; and scorpions had crawled into tents. According to Calvin Shedd, a Union soldier, the only cure for a sting was enough whiskey to render the victim ''dead drunk.''</p>
        <p>I never saw a scorpion on the island, though I did find a magenta hermit crab jonesing for a meal in my sandwich bag.</p>
        <p>Like all visitors, I toured Fort Jefferson, mostly vacant and starting to crumble. Within the massive brick walls are a visitor center, a diesel-powered generator and a few park service apartments. Each year, marine researchers use the fort as a base to study the mating habits of nurse sharks in the shallow waters off Bush Key.</p>
        <p>Since its closing in 1874, the fort has been settling into the coralline sands. Bricks slough into the moat, exposing invertebrate ossuaries of staghorn and brain corals, conchs and clams: when the fort was built, the offshore reefs were mined for fill and mortar.</p>
        <p>Looking out from the fort, the blood-red cannon portals set a striking frame for the sea. In spots, the ocean appears swimming-pool blue; in others it takes on the deeper hues of turtle grass, red algae, late afternoon, night. The palette is determined by water depth, reefs and wrecks, cloud cover, even the passing silhouettes of seabirds.</p>
        <p>I SPENT much of one afternoon reading and watching magnificent frigate birds soar overhead. They cruised in from offshore and turned their seven-foot wingspans into the wind, rising with the updraft over the fort. On occasion, a male showed off its bright red throat patch, an indication that mating season wasn't too far off. One of these scissor-tailed seabirds had excellent aim, letting loose on my open book, ''The Birds of Heaven'' (page 5). It was an exclamation point to a fine afternoon.</p>
        <p>For birds, spring in the Tortugas is a mob scene. Migrating species stop by, and tens of thousands of sooty terns and brown noddies flock to Bush and Long Keys, their only significant nesting grounds in North America. They're a raucous, restless bunch, seeming to cover every bay cedar tree, every grain of sand.</p>
        <p>When the ferries arrived again on my second day, bringing scores of new visitors to Garden Key, I felt crowded myself, though I knew they would stay for only about four hours. By now I had also found I could feel squeezed even in the tiny, thinly populated campground.</p>
        <p>The whole point to sleeping out is to get away, after all, not to watch my neighbors cook a meal that is inevitably better than mine. During my stay, I shared the grounds with a family of four from somewhere far away (big on the sausages); Mr. Outside Magazine, who traveled with his kayak, fishing rod, snorkel gear, big bag of beef jerky and Marlboro Lights; and a couple who seemed to eat nothing at all, spending most of their time on the empty beach, the woman's navel in permanent transit across a blue-sun tattoo.</p>
        <p>But campground closeness is a minor quibble. Once the ferry rounds the reefs, Garden Key reclaims its desert-island status. Ghost crabs dig out of their burrows, throwing up fresh mounds of sand on the beach. The shade of a buttonwood tree provides a welcome escape from the sun. And a rampart overlooking the fort is a fine place for watching the terns and frigate birds swoop in from offshore. You might want to wear a hat.</p>
        <p>IF YOU GO  Dry and Wild</p>
        <p>TWO high-speed ferries make daily excursions from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. Sunny Days Catamarans charges $110 round-trip for day-trippers; campers are charged $150 (800-236-7937; www.sunnydayskeywest.com). Yankee Freedom II charges $129 round-trip for day visitors and $159 for campers (800-634-0939; www.yankeefreedom.com). Both boats depart at 8 a.m.; reservations are recommended. Don't forget to bring plenty of water and a camping stove or charcoal .</p>
        <p>Day-trippers can also travel to Fort Jefferson on a 45-minute flight with Sea Planes of Key West for $189 a person (800-950-2359; seaplanesofkeywest.com).</p>
        <p>The park charges a $5 entrance fee, which is collected by the ferries. For campers, there is a $3 charge a night; only cash and personal checks are accepted at the campground. It's first come first served, but, according to the ranger Mike Ryan, no one has ever been turned away. The park's Web site is www.nps.gov/drto.</p>
