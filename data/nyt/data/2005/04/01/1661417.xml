        <p>'Incidents'  Julie Saul Gallery  535 West 22nd Street  Chelsea  Through April 23</p>
        <p>Surely one of the wackier manifestations of the widespread rage for auto-photography is ''Untitled (Self-Portrait-Globus),'' by Gonzalo Puch, a Spanish artist having his first solo show in this country. A large c-print, it depicts Mr. Puch lying on the floor, his mouth affixed to a tube. He is engaged in the inane activity of blowing up a huge erratically shaped globethat rests on his belly.</p>
        <p>The ''globe'' is built of maps haphazardly glued together in an arrangement bearing little relation to the traditional orb. It seems to puff and strain at its own crankily rock-shaped outline as the artist's breath goes in.</p>
        <p>It's the punchiest in this show of five, well, metaphysical photographs that seem to comment ironically on science, art, their ambitions and intersections. (One way of reading this particular image may be as a sendup of several features that characterize today's art world: the fetish for outsize imagery, the size of artists' egos, and the dream of making it big.)</p>
        <p>In another scene, a young man sits in front of a huge red-papered wall, plastered all over with cut-out white numbers, some large, some small. Surrounded by remnants of white paper, he's intensely engaged in scissoring still more of these meaningless digits to affix to the wall.</p>
        <p>It's harder to infer a meaning from Mr. Puch's other endeavors. Still life arrangements that use legible props like plants, blackboards, lab flasks and terrariums, they are more arcane, perhaps less interesting because they lack human presence. Still, it's not easy to do conceptually oriented photographs with pizazz, and a score of two winners out of five is not to be dimissed.</p>
