        <p>While many large colleges and universities are identified with cities, community colleges are more likely to be associated with the suburbs. But in parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, community colleges, often working closely with public officials, are taking important roles in the renewal of downtown areas.</p>
        <p>In Peekskill, N.Y., for example, Westchester Community College was a catalyst a decade ago in a redevelopment that has led to the restoration of a number of vacant or underused properties. Now, community colleges have announced plans that could have positive effects on the future development of downtown New Haven and of Riverhead and Sayville on Long Island.</p>

        <p>While many large colleges and universities are identified with cities, community colleges are more likely to be associated with the suburbs. But in parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, community colleges, often working closely with public officials, are taking important roles in the renewal of downtown areas.</p>
        <p>In Peekskill, N.Y., for example, Westchester Community College was a catalyst a decade ago in a redevelopment that has led to the restoration of a number of vacant or underused properties. Now, community colleges have announced plans that could have positive effects on the future development of downtown New Haven and of Riverhead and Sayville on Long Island.</p>
        <p>In New Haven, the state of Connecticut, along with city officials, announced a $230 million development in June 2004 to relocate both the Long Wharf Theater, which is now on Sargent Drive, and Gateway Community College. They would be moved to a long-struggling part of the city's downtown, with about $140 million earmarked for the project.</p>
        <p>Gateway is now split into two campuses. Preliminary plans call for two new buildings on opposite sides of George Street, covering about 359,000 square feet. The two-story buildings would be connected by a pedestrian bridge and would take up two large blocks that formerly housed two department stores: Macy's and Malley's. Although the former Macy's is still standing, the Malley's store was razed in 1997.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, the revitalization plans are smaller in scope, but still noteworthy, development officials say. Suffolk County Community College is completing plans to expand its nursing program to downtown Sayville and move its rapidly growing culinary arts program, which now has 80 students, to a building to be built in downtown Riverhead by the Parr Organization, a developer based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Phil Cardinale, the town supervisor, said that the two-story 28,000-square-foot building would be built on the largest piece of vacant land downtown, a site that has been designated for urban renewal since 1998.</p>
        <p>George Gatta, vice president for work force and economic development at Suffolk County Community College, said the site had been picked because it was close to the college's Riverhead campus, which is about three miles away, and because tourism was growing rapidly in Riverhead and the demand for culinary workers is rising. The culinary arts program is expected to expand to include hotel and resort management and to accommodate 250 students by 2010.</p>
        <p>David M. Feehan, president of the International Downtown Association, a Washington-based group that represents many business improvement districts, said that community colleges were opening more urban campuses, both to gain a broader range of students and to make use of the public transportation that is often available. In the process, they are helping to revitalize many downtowns.</p>
        <p>That is certainly the case with Westchester Community College, whose main campus is on 218 bucolic acres in Valhalla, N.Y. But it has also established major operations in the downtown areas of Peekskill, Mount Vernon and Yonkers. ''I would say that our biggest accomplishment has been access,'' said Joseph N. Hankin, the president of the college.</p>
        <p>In Peekskill, city officials say that Westchester Community College deserves credit for helping to revive the downtown area, which continues to draw new business, especially in the arts. In 1994, the college opened a 10,000-square-foot extension site for the arts in Peekskill on the site of an old Woolworth store, and in 2003 it took over the entire 20,000-square-foot building.</p>
        <p>That same year, the college opened an extension site in downtown Mount Vernon, in a renovated 16,000-square-foot building that once housed a Sears store. Mr. Hankin says the college is considering establishing an extension campus in downtown Port Chester as well.</p>
        <p>Development officials laud that kind of interest. They say community colleges often bring broader economic benefits to downtown areas than traditional colleges do because their student bodies tend to be older and more diversified and many students already have jobs.</p>
        <p>''Community colleges add diversity in every respect,'' said Cathy Coleman, executive director of the Downtown Norfolk Council, a group that manages the business improvement district in Norfolk, Va., where Tidewater Community College opened a campus in 1997 by renovating old buildings. Ms. Coleman says the campus has helped to stimulate further development, including two new office buildings and a one-million-square-foot shopping center.</p>
        <p>In the New York area, some community colleges have long been in downtowns, like the Borough of Manhattan Community College and Monroe College, which offers both associate and bachelor degrees in downtown New Rochelle. When Monroe moved to New Rochelle in 1983 from the Bronx, it occupied half of an old government agency building on Main Street. Since then, it has expanded to cover about three city blocks, on property that either needed upgrading or was vacant, like the long-empty Librett hardware store on Main Street.</p>
        <p>In downtown Trenton, the James Kerney campus of Mercer County Community College, based in West Windsor, N.J., is about to expand again. The 75,000-square-foot campus has enlarged twice since it was established in 1975, and now it is about to build a large all-glass facade to make the college more visible and to attract more local development, said Beverly Richardson, the campus provost.</p>
        <p>Developers are alert to such expansion opportunities. On Long Island, Ron Parr, the head of the Parr Organization, is enthusiastic about plans that Suffolk County Community College now has for a 3,000-square-foot bistro and cafe at its new building in Riverhead, and he is considering building 250 apartments in downtown Riverhead to cater to younger home buyers. ''We think the college will be a catalyst for other development,'' Mr. Parr said.</p>
