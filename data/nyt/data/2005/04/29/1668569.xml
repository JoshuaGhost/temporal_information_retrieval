        <p>A judge handed down murder convictions for a farm owner and an employee who were accused of beating a rural laborer and then throwing him to 20 rare white lions. The farmer, Mark Scott-Crossley, left, and his employee, Simon Mathebula, were said to have attacked Nelson Chisale with knives in January 2004, after Mr. Chisale, who had been fired, came to collect his belongings. Mr. Chisale was tied to a tree and beaten, then driven to the lion enclosure and thrown over its fence. Only part of a skull, a few bones and shredded clothes remained when the police searched the pen. Testimony never established whether Mr. Chisale was alive when he was tossed to the lions. The spectacular case was held up as an example of continuing racism in rural South Africa. Mr. Scott-Crossley is white, his employee and Mr. Chisale black.</p>
