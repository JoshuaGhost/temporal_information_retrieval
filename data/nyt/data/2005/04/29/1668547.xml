        <p>ATLANTA, April 28 - A suburban Atlanta woman vanished days before she was to be married, and the police said Thursday that they were pursuing a criminal investigation.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A suburban Atlanta woman vanished days before she was to be married, and the police said Thursday that they were pursuing a criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>The search for the woman, Jennifer Wilbanks, stretched through a second day in the northeast suburb of Duluth, where hundreds of neighbors, police officers and wedding guests scoured neighborhoods and riverbanks and passed out fliers.</p>
        <p>Chief Randy Belcher of the Duluth police said Ms. Wilbanks's fiancé had been asked to take a polygraph test. Her fiancé, John Mason, was the last person known to have seen her. The chief called the request routine and said there were no suspects and, for that matter, ''no indication that a crime has been committed.'' The case was labeled a criminal investigation, he said, because there was nothing else to explain why Ms. Wilbanks, 32, had vanished.</p>
        <p>She was last seen Tuesday by Mr. Mason around 8:30 p.m. as she left to go running, the police said. Her family said she had left behind her keys, her cellphone and her diamond ring, carrying only an MP3 player. When she did not return on time, Mr. Mason went looking for her, then called the police, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Chief Belcher said Thursday that Ms. Wilbanks had no regular jogging route.</p>
        <p>A search covering five square miles on Wednesday was expanded early Thursday after investigators learned that Ms. Wilbanks had run in marathons. Chief Belcher said searchers in several locations had found a variety of sweatshirts and sweatpants, and what appeared to be a clump of hair. Those were being analyzed.</p>
        <p>Bloodhounds were called in, and officers searched the Chattahoochee River, which passes by at least three parks and several trails in Duluth, a park ranger said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were checking tips.</p>
        <p>Friends and family who expected to be at Ms. Wilbanks's wedding on Saturday waited tensely at the home she shared with Mr. Mason. ''We're just standing by,'' said Mike Satterfield, an uncle.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilbanks's family dismissed any suggestion that she may have gotten cold feet about the wedding, telling investigators that running away was not in her character.</p>
        <p>Still, Chief Belcher would not rule it out. ''I mean how many husbands have gone out to go get a pack of cigarettes and never came back home?'' he said. But in the end, he voiced frustration.</p>
        <p>''We have nothing,'' he said. ''This is just a case where a lady went and jogged and didn't come back.''</p>
