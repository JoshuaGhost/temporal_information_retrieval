        <p>''Ladies in Lavender'' offers the opportunity to watch two beloved dames of the British Empire rattle around a house in Cornwall, exchanging snippets of subtext-heavy dialogue in the breaks between picking flowers, knitting and listening to the radio. The year is 1936, and through the static we discern that across the English Channel, world war is a-brewing.</p>
        <p>Those facts should stir the hearts of diehard Anglophiles of a certain generation into a frothy pitter-patter. What bliss that these purple personages should be played by none other than Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith!</p>

        <p>''Ladies in Lavender'' offers the opportunity to watch two beloved dames of the British Empire rattle around a house in Cornwall, exchanging snippets of subtext-heavy dialogue in the breaks between picking flowers, knitting and listening to the radio. The year is 1936, and through the static we discern that across the English Channel, world war is a-brewing.</p>
        <p>Those facts should stir the hearts of diehard Anglophiles of a certain generation into a frothy pitter-patter. What bliss that these purple personages should be played by none other than Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith!</p>
        <p>But don't set your expectations too high. As Ursula and Janet Widdington, twittering sisters of late middle age who share a house on a bluff with their fussy housekeeper, Dorcas (Miriam Margolyes), these two great actresses sink into their roles as comfortably as house cats burrowing into a down quilt on a windswept, rainy night. (And since this is Cornwall, such nights are plentiful.)</p>
        <p>But those hoping to see two pedigreed felines arch their backs and claw at the scenery will be disappointed. The most high drama unleashed by either sister is the discreet, disapproving little hiss that Janet (Dame Maggie) releases in reaction to the romantic disorientation of her emotionally vulnerable younger sister, Ursula (Dame Judi). Otherwise, Dame Maggie keeps her withering hauteur firmly in check.</p>
        <p>One morning after the latest piece of major weather has blown by Cornwall, what should the sisters discover on the rocky beach below their home but an unconscious young man washed up by the angry sea? The rest of the movie explores the identity of this mystery guest, as the doting duo revive and nurse him back to health with the assistance of a local doctor (David Warner). While recovering his health, the stranger is revealed to be -- what else? -- a violin virtuoso!</p>
        <p>Only in bittersweet dramas about lonely older women do shipwrecked young men with princely airs emerge from the sea to stir the dying embers in the hearth. For this amiably far-fetched film, the direction of Charles Dance, who adapted the screenplay from a short story by William J. Locke, heralds the return of the Comfy Movie (increasingly rare nowadays), the cinematic equivalent of a visit from a cherished but increasingly dithery maiden aunt.</p>
        <p>In this fading, sentimental genre peopled with grandes dames (usually English) making ''grande'' pronouncements, the world revolves around tea, gardening and misty watercolor memories. Terence Rattigan and No l Coward perfected the Comfy Movie's tone of stiff-upper-lip sadness and nobility leavened with enlightenment.</p>
        <p>The handsome stranger on the shore, Andrea Marowski (Daniel Brühl), is eventually revealed to be a Polish émigré fleeing to the United States. Exactly how he was pitched into the sea is left to our imaginations. All we're given is a fleeting, clumsily inserted flashback of the young man flailing around underwater.</p>
        <p>Janet, who lost her husband in World War I, has known true love and accepted its loss, but Ursula, whose maternal doting on Andrea mutates into a romantic fixation, hasn't. The delicate kernel of the story follows Ursula's increasingly besotted state and her embarrassment as Andrea recovers and casts his eyes elsewhere.</p>
        <p>A nearby cottage is occupied by an attractive young painter, Olga Danilof (Natascha McElhone, looking alarmingly cadaverous, with sunken cheeks and zombie eyes), a summer visitor who spends her days perched in front of an easel overlooking the sea. Olga, drawn by the sound of Andrea playing a borrowed fiddle, strays onto the Widdington property and is immediately perceived as a threat. That doesn't prevent her from asking Andrea if she can paint his portrait.</p>
        <p>As its romantic score (composed by Nigel Hess and played by Joshua Bell) billows and swells, ''Ladies in Lavender'' suggests a more level-headed variation of ''Humoresque.'' Here, at least, nobody ends up walking into the sea in an alcoholic funk to the strains of the ''Liebestod'' wafting over the radio. Joan Crawford had to die for our sins. These staunch English ladies wouldn't dream of making such a stupid sacrifice.</p>
        <p>''Ladies in Lavender'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.</p>
        <p>Ladies in Lavender  Opens today in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California.</p>
        <p>Directed by Charles Dance; written by Mr. Dance, based on the short story by William J. Locke; director of photography, Peter Biziou; edited by Michael Parker; music by Nigel Hess, with violin solos performed by Joshua Bell; production designer, Caroline Amies; produced by Nicolas Brown, Elizabeth Karlsen and Nik Powell; released by Roadside Attractions.
