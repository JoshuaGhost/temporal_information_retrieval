        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While some may be excited about the new-found ability of postmenopausal women to become pregnant ("Menopause Is Found No Bar to Pregnancy," front page, Oct. 25), I am much more dismayed than excited by the prospect. As the case of surrogate motherhood in Santa Ana, Calif. (news article, Oct. 23), taught us, new technology in fertilization can make more problems in defining who are the parents than it solves by allowing an infertile couple to conceive. So, too, this new fertilization technique using donated eggs is sure to give rise to lawsuits that will vainly try to answer the question, "Who is the mother of this baby?"</p>
        <p>Now it's true that men have been semen donors for years, and the issue of paternity only rarely, if ever, comes up. But with women donating eggs there is much less anonymity, and there is a natural bond that a woman feels to her child.</p>
        <p>So it's a sad day for me, and for others who are confronted by these "new families." As usual, a sad day for me means a happy one for lawyers. JOSEPH M. SCHELLER, M.D. Associate Director Pediatric Teaching Program Mercy Hospital and Medical Center San Diego, Nov. 2, 1990</p>
