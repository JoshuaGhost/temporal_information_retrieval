        <p>THE GERMANS: A People at the Crossroads.  By David Marsh. (St. Martin's, $22.95.) There is a hint of pretentiousness about books on whole nations that are titled with a "the" -- as in "The Germans" or "The Russians." But let us see -- does the author deliver? David Marsh, chief German correspondent of the London Financial Times, has updated the 1989 British edition of his book, "The Germans," with some cutting and pasting to bring us beyond the fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of the Communist system in East Germany and the express-train rush toward unification of the two German states. His thesis is that "Germany's destiny will shape the future of Europe" either to the Continent's benefit or to its risk. So far, so good, although I think one could argue with equal force that Europe's destiny will shape the future of Germany, as it has increasingly in recent decades. But to propose to inform readers about the nation and then largely or completely ignore the women of Germany, the writers of Germany, the film makers of Germany and even some of the major postwar politicians like Herbert Wehner or Theodor Heuss who played central roles in shaping modern Germany is to leave yawning gaps. "The Germans" is further marred by sloppy and turgid writing, awkward usages like "ecumenicalism" -- to describe the role of a church in northern Germany -- and an excess of material taken over unrevised from the previous edition that is now obsolete or irrelevant. On the plus side, Mr. Marsh has dealt at some length with the still unresolved problem of German national identity, which is the core of understanding this strange people, and with demography -- the peculiarity of a declining birth rate for the Germans themselves and the burgeoning of foreign-born people in their midst, now exceeding 5 million in what was West Germany. The best material in this book may be the lengthy quotations the author has assembled in the course of numerous interviews with politicians, bankers and some less extraordinary Germans. They at least give a sense of how contemporary Germans think about themselves and their world. Mr. Marsh is far less eloquent than his subjects.</p>
