        <p>Barring a collapse brought about by the wave of political violence now afflicting Guatemala, the general elections on Sunday and the inauguration of a President in January should mark a democratic watershed: the first transfer of power from one elected civilian to another in the country's history.</p>
        <p>That would be a significant step for the United States-backed effort to end a tradition of military dictatorship and build a working democratic system.</p>
        <p>But Western diplomats say the political violence illustrates President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's failure to gain control over the armed forces and end the institutionalized terrorism that limits political expression to the right and the extreme right.</p>
        <p>"The only left here is in the mountains," said Juan Francisco Alfaro, secretary general of the Confederation of Guatemalan Union Groups, the largest labor organization in the country, in referring to a three-decade-old guerrilla movement. Only Hints at Reform</p>
        <p>Most leading candidates have announced ambitious programs to stabilize the foundering economy. But they have not dared to do more than hint at plans for demilitarization, agrarian reform, population control or land redistribution. Such programs would address the problems most often cited as the causes of the pervasive poverty and political repression that have led to two decades of war and bloodshed.</p>
        <p>The results have been growing apathy and hopelesses in the face of growing violence, a resurgent guerrilla movement and corruption by the ruling Christian Democrats. Increasingly, Guatemalans equate democracy with anarchy and yearn for the strict hand of military government.</p>
        <p>"People are asking themselves: Is this what we wanted? Is this the system we fought for?" said Edmond Mulet, a senior opposition deputy. "There's enormous frustration. In only five years the whole system is besieged. Whatever happened to our dreams?"</p>
        <p>In a startling turnaround from the national jubilation that greeted Mr. Cerezo's 1985 election, polls now find a five-point preference for military regimes over democratic governments. But the army, which squashed two right-wing coup attempts against Mr. Cerezo, is expected to accept any of the three leading candidates. A Wealthy Front-Runner</p>
        <p>Polls show that the front-runner is Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a wealthy newspaper publisher and founder of the National Center Union. In an effort to broaden his appeal in the private sector, he enlisted as his running mate Manuel Ayau Cordon, a businessman who started as a presidential candidate of the far-right National Liberation Movement.</p>
        <p>Senior members of the National Center Union have acknowledged that it was unlikely that the ticket could win the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff in January. That has made the campaign into a scramble for second place between Alvaro Arzu, the wealthy former mayor of the capital and the ex-president of the National Liberation Movement, and Jorge Antonio Serrano, an evangelist and the president of the council of state during the regime of the dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt.  The General's Reputation</p>
        <p>Mr. Serrano has benefited from the collapse of the general's own candidacy, which ended last month when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional provision barring former dictators from power. In the most obvious sign of the country's disillusionment with democracy, the general was until then the front-runner, even though thousands of civilians were killed during his rule in the early 1980's. But his 16-month tenure is now remembered more for stability than for bloodshed.</p>
        <p>The national dissatisfaction seems to have buried the chances of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the candidate of the ruling Christian Democrats, who by law may not renominate the President. Mr. Cabrera's campaign has faltered since he was stricken with pancreatitis earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cerezo spent his first two years as President pushing demilitarization and Guatemala seemed to be fertile soil for democracy.  But Guatemalan politicians say their President appeared to give up and became content to finish his term. He stopped going regularly to his office, and his aides were replaced by girlfriends who surrounded him in what has been described as "a thicket of pretty legs."</p>
        <p>Violence began to mount. In the first nine months of this year, there were 276 political murders and 145 disappearances, according to the congressionally appointed Human Rights Ombudsman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cerezo has described the human rights abuses as the final spasms of a dying era. But many Guatemalans blame the President, saying he allowed himself to become a captive of the army. They note the military staffs his country estate, providing even the servants. When aides went to see him there earlier this year, they said they were required to park their cars and ride the last two miles on Army buses.</p>
        <p>"He became the caged pet of the army," Jorge Skinner Klee, a senior opposition Congressman, said.</p>
        <p>But some diplomats say Mr. Cerezo came to rely on the army because it is the only bureaucracy that works. He asked civilian aides two years ago to prepare his position papers for a summit meeting in Mexico. They never produced. Finally, he turned to the army. It had a series of detailed plans on his desk within a week.</p>
