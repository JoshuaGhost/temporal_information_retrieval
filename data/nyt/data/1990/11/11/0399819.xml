        <p>JUST a half-mile east of the intersection of Route 80 and the New Jersey Turnpike lies an unlikely suburban oasis. On the eastern bank of Overpeck Creek, behind the high willows and thick green pin oaks, the persistent roar of rushing traffic quickly gives way to the gentle rhythm of neatly timed hoofs in an easy canter.</p>
        <p>The Overpeck Riding Center in Leonia, home to 58 horses and one international competition rider, seems oddly out of place in the center of densely populated southeastern Bergen County. Indeed, residents say, it is.But that is just what gives it its charm.</p>
        <p>"When I look out my window and see the trees and the creek and the horses, I forget that I live next door to the New Jersey Turnpike," said Heidi Ericksen, the 37-year-old resident manager of the 44-acre riding center.</p>
        <p>The center, which lies at the southern tip of Bergen County's Overpeck Park, is a tree-shaded refuge bordered by picnic tables and playgrounds on one end and pasture and meadows on the other.</p>
        <p>Though owned by Bergen County, the center is operated by the Claremont Riding Academy under a five-year lease agreement signed in 1987.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ericksen was a reserve member of the United States Olympic Equestrian Team for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.  Though as reserve rider she did not get a chance to compete, the designation won her wide recognition as one of the top riders in the country.</p>
        <p>Her position at Overpeck, Ms. Ericksen said, allows her to earn a living doing what she loves most, teaching students and training horses, and at the same time gives her time to practice with her 11-year-old Swedish-warmblood stallion, Prego.</p>
        <p>But practice time often slips away, she said, with the increased responsibilities associated with running the center. After two years in business, the stable now has 58 horses and 26 employees, 16 of whom are instructors giving as many as 350 riding lessons a week.</p>
        <p>"I don't really take vacations," said Ms. Ericksen, who lives in a small apartment at the center and gives a full schedule of lessons herself. "This is too much fun."</p>
        <p>The Overpeck Riding Center is considered by those who train and board horses there to be one of the best stables in the New York metropolitan region. It consists of a barn, two outdoor rings and two indoor rings, one of which is Grand Prix size -- 200 by 300 feet. In addition, boarders use about 40 acres of trails that meander along the banks of Overpeck Creek.</p>
        <p>For most of the students at the center, however, the trails are an unnecessary diversion from the real work of learning to ride.</p>
        <p>"My daughter started me on this," said Victoria Renard of Queens, who had just completed a lesson. Mrs. Renard's 10-year-old daughter, Valerie, had been taking lessons at the center while her mother watched.  But after a few weeks of watching, Mrs. Renard signed up for some lessons of her own.</p>
        <p>"It's a great feeling to get on an animal like that and make it do what you want it to do," Mrs. Renard said after a recent lesson.  "And riding at a fast trot is like going 80 miles per hour in a Maserati on an open stretch of road." 'Become One With the Horse'</p>
        <p>But for other riders at Overpeck, speed takes second place to precision, the precision found in dressage and jumping.</p>
        <p>In dressage competition, the goal is essentially to persuade a horse to do that which it is most unlikely to do on its own. Like walking sideways -- gracefully.</p>
        <p>"You must become one with the horse," said Karensa Muller, 24, who came to Overpeck from her home in the Netherlands to train horses and to practice her own skills.  "It's a kind of ballet: you don't see the rider do anything, it's just one big picture, the horse just moves." Ms. Muller, who will soon be returning to the Netherlands, said she hoped eventually to compete internationally.</p>
        <p>"I'm learning," she said. "I know I've got the feeling. I've just got to develop it more."</p>
        <p>And while Ms. Muller teaches her horse to dance, Brian Young, 19, of Leonia, teaches his to fly.</p>
        <p>"At first it's difficult," Mr. Young said after practicing in the outdoor jump ring with Anshante, an 8-year-old Dutchwarm blood he trains for a boarder at the center.  "You have to first learn to accept the horse's attitude," he said. "Then you have to get the 1,200-pound monster to jump."</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, who recently won third place in the National Intercollegiate Horse Show Association Championships, is a sophomore at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck. Training Other People's Horses</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, like Ms. Ericksen, gets most of his practice by training other people's horses. Anshante's owners, for example, bought their horse primarily for competition, boarded him at Overpeck and hired Mr. Young to train him.</p>
        <p>But others who keep horses at Overpeck have different motives for paying the $600 a month it costs to board there.</p>
        <p>"It's a total family commitment," said Nicholas P. Gamarello, 35, of Hasbrouck Heights. "We revolve our life around equestrian interests."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gamarello, his wife, Mary, and their daughters, Gabrielle, 8, and Ashley, 6, are the owners of Indian, a 7-year-old sorrel-and-white Overo paint.</p>
        <p>"Paint is a breed and Overo is a variety of paint," Mr. Gamarello explained as he tidied up Indian's stall while Mrs. Gamarello rode the horse in the Grand Prix ring.</p>
        <p>"We found him in Wyoming while we were on vacation," Mr. Gamarello said, "and we brought him back with us. He's a Western horse that made the transition to English, and I've never seen him happier."</p>
        <p>English riding, the type taught at Overpeck, uses a smaller, lighter saddle and more subtle commands than Western riding, Mr. Gamarello said. As a result, he said, English is slightly more difficult for the novice rider to learn, but much less stressful for the horse. "You communicate with your body," Mr. Gamarello said. "You're not dictating to them, 'Do this and do that.' You're working together."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gamarello said that though he had been to other stables in the area, "some more expensive, some less expensive," none compared to Overpeck for cleanliness, professionalism of the staff and care for the animals.</p>
        <p>"The thing that makes this stable so beautiful is that there's such a sincere love of horses among the people who work here," he said. "It's almost like a fraternity. They don't penny-pinch on food, it's always clean, and the horses always seem happy and healthy."</p>
        <p>"Look at that stall," Mr. Gamarello added, pointing to Indian's sparse wooden apartment. "I could sleep in there."</p>
        <p>Residents also appreciate the center and the rural atmosphere it lends to the busy bedroom community just eight miles away from Manhattan. 'Like an Instant Escape'</p>
        <p>"I can look out my window and see a beautiful sunset and horses running in a field," said Teri McNamara, 34, who lives in a row of homes behind the center. "It's like an instant escape. It's one of the reasons I bought here."</p>
        <p>Dorothy Anne Droser, a Leonia resident for 22 years, was with her grandson, Clifford Casey, as he watched riders and their horses practicing in the jump ring.</p>
        <p>"It's amazing," Mrs. Droser said, "to have something this rural so close to New York."</p>
        <p>She steadied her grandson as he climbed to the top rail of the fence for a better view.  Once settled there, Clifford volunteered his own equestrian credentials.</p>
        <p>"A long, long time ago," the 4-year-old on the fence said, "I went for a ride on a pony."</p>
