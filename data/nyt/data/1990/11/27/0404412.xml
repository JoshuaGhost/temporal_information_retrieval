        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Once again, New York City is faced with a financial deficit and must cut back on each department's budget. Sadly, these cuts usually result in loss of service to the public.</p>
        <p>This does not have to be the case with the New York City Fire Department. By transferring the responsibility for marine fire protection to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the city would be relieved of a multimillion-dollar expense without any curtailment in service to the citizens of New York.</p>
        <p>The marine companies of the Fire Department have the highest expense and capital budgets of all fire units. The fireboat fleet, maintained by the city, provides fire protection for the piers and shipping in New Jersey, as well as New York. Indeed, most of the marine firefighting is done in and around New Jersey waterways. New Jersey has no marine fire protection and does not contribute to the protection provided by New York.</p>
        <p>Since New York is providing a bistate fireboat fleet, it seems logical that a bistate agency should be willing to assume the burden borne so many years by New York City.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority is already responsible for all aircraft fires at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports. With this background, it should be a relatively easy matter for the authority to absorb the marine fire protection for the waters of the Port of New York.</p>
        <p>This transfer can be effected with no loss of jobs or benefits. The firefighters could be transferred to land companies and the licensed personnel -- pilots and marine engineers required by Coast Guard regulations -- would continue in the same occupations under the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>Instead of closing fire companies, as under the present plan, effect this transfer and greater savings will result without any diminution of service. CHARLES T. RYAN  Staten Island, Nov. 14, 1990 The writer is professor emeritus of fire science at John Jay College.</p>
