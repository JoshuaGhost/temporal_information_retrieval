        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In Fred Hechinger's column about the Central Park East Secondary School (Education page, Nov. 7), the school's lack of violence is treated as an unusual and almost unexplained situation.</p>
        <p>But those of us who have been involved with alternative education have known about this phenomenon for more than 20 years. The key is that the students at Deborah Meier's school like to be there and feel empowered or, to use Ms. Meier's word, "engaged" with their own education.</p>
        <p>Children are natural learners, yet we are willing to believe that children "naturally" don't like school.</p>
        <p>At hundreds of alternative schools (not to mention hundreds of thousands of home schools), the children like the education with which they are involved.</p>
        <p>As editor of a directory of alternative schools, I have visited more than 150 such schools, and I have never seen one in which violence -- or, for that matter, vandalism -- constituted a problem.</p>
        <p>There are virtually no studies about this, because the alternative schools have had to keep a low profile to survive the 1980's. They have almost become black holes, having to be satisfied with the support and gratitude of the parents and students in each school, without trying to influence the educational establishment.</p>
        <p>It's about time that the secret got out, that there are true educational alternatives that are working. The educational establishment had better learn about them -- quick. The success at Central Park East is significant, but not unique. JERRY MINTZ  Roslyn Heights, L.I., Nov. 7, 1990</p>
