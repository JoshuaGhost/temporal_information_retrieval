        <p>A tenement neighborhood in the eastern part of the city was shaken by violence today when about 1,500 heavily armed police officers with tear gas and water cannons were sent to clear houses being held by squatters.</p>
        <p>For nearly six hours beginning early today, a block-long stretch of Mainzer Strasse in the largely working-class Friedrichshain district resembled a battlefield.

        <p>A tenement neighborhood in the eastern part of the city was shaken by violence today when about 1,500 heavily armed police officers with tear gas and water cannons were sent to clear houses being held by squatters.</p>
        <p>For nearly six hours beginning early today, a block-long stretch of Mainzer Strasse in the largely working-class Friedrichshain district resembled a battlefield. Gangs of squatters on rooftops, some masked, bombarded police officers with cobblestones and gasoline bombs, and the police fired tear gas and water cannons.</p>
        <p>The squatters, mostly from western Berlin and western Germany, first fought with the police late Monday night, then constructed a veritable fortress throughout the area, digging deep ditches with a stolen excavator, stringing barbed wire and storing stones, gasoline bombs and railroad flares as weapons.</p>
        <p>This evening, thousands of squatters and their supporters marched through Berlin to protest the action, in which the authorities said at least 85 people, including 70 police officers, were injured and 350 people were taken into custody.</p>
        <p>Speakers Denounce the Police</p>
        <p>Speakers at the rally, which wound its way toward the Red Town Hall in eastern Berlin, denounced the police for their raid and called for written guarantees for the squatters, who have occupied more than 100 apartments in the rundown eastern part of the city. Others demanded the resignation of the Interior Minister, Erich Patzold, a Social Democrat and ally of Mayor Walter Momper.</p>
        <p>"I am not a supporter and I am not a sympathizer of the squatters," said Steffen Weste, a 20-year-old who marched with his girlfriend, "but I am against violence regardless of the reason."</p>
        <p>Tonight, long after most demonstrators had left the area, roaming bands of youths hurled gasoline bombs and smashed store windows along Frankfurter Allee, and then were chased by heavily armed police throughout an area stretching toward Warschauer Strasse.</p>
        <p>The fighting posed a serious challenge to Mr. Momper's city government, which relies on a coalition of his own Social Democrats and the leftist Alternative List. People close to the government said "councils of war" were under way this evening at which leaders of the the Social Democrats and the Alternative List, which supports the squatters, will decide the city government's future. The people who discussed the meetings said Mr. Momper may be forced to govern Berlin, a city of more than three million, with a minority government until local elections on Dec. 2, which coincide with voting for a new federal legislature in Bonn.</p>
        <p>Several Alternative List leaders who joined the squatters today in a gesture of solidarity were detained but were later released. The group's city council leader, Renate Kunast, denounced the police action and endorsed the squatters' demand for a peaceful discussion of their claims.  Violence 'of the Worst Kind</p>
        <p>Addressing a news conference, Mr. Momper shielded the police officers, who were reinforced by units from western Germany, and condemned the fighting as "quite simply, criminal violence of the worst kind."</p>
        <p>"Whoever shows solidarity with them, shows solidarity for the wrong people," he said of the squatters.</p>
        <p>In what used to be West Berlin, young people with counterculture ways, some of them sympathetic to the urban terrorism that has plagued West Germany for almost two decades, had occupied numerous neighborhoods, mostly in the Kreuzberg district of the city. Since the opening of the Berlin wall about a year ago, some have settled in the east, and the police offensive this week is thought to have been intended to put a stop to their illegal squatting.</p>
        <p>The violence started on Monday when the police evicted squatters from several apartments in the Prenzlauer Berg district, also in the east, provoking heavy fighting late Monday night between the police and squatters.</p>
        <p>The Government in Bonn is also paying close attention to the clashes, which were only the latest in a recent wave of violence in former east Germany. On Tuesday, the authorities let it be known that they were taking the unusual step of canceling a major soccer match scheduled for Nov. 21 in the southern city of Leipzig because of clashes there this month in which police officers shot to death one youth and seriously injured three others.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, the police used water cannons, dogs and tear gas to disperse gangs of youths who rampaged after soccer games in Magdeburg and Rostock, both in what used to be East Germany.  'Terror in the Streets'</p>
        <p>In Bonn, the State Secretary in the Interior Ministry, Horst Waffenschmidt, today pledged federal support so that newly established freedoms in former East Germany were "not put in danger by terror in the streets."</p>
        <p>The Christian Democrats of Chancellor Helmut Kohl have been using the violence and disorder as ammunition in the campaign for the election in December, suggesting that a vote for leftist parties like the Social Democrats would be a vote for chaos.</p>
        <p>The issue also affects discussions about the future site of the all-German seat of government, to which Berlin lays claim. The Christian Democrats, who command the largest bloc in the Bonn legislature, have suggested that a Berlin governed by leftist groups like the Social Democrats and Alternative List would be an unreliable seat of Parliament and the ministries.  East's Social Problems Blamed</p>
        <p>Today, speakers for the Alternative List blamed increasing social problems in eastern Germany, notably unemployment, for the violence, and emphasized that 27,000 apartments stand empty in eastern Berlin, many deserted by East Germans who fled to the west over the last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Momper acknowledged that social conflicts were behind some of the clashes and chided the Bonn Government for delaying the resolution of important social questions, like the ownership of many formerly state-controled buildings in the east. He warned his political opponents against using the issue as campaign ammunition, though he conceded that "Berlin mirrors the social conflicts of all Germany and the social problems of unification."</p>
        <p>"Housing shortages, unemployment and decay are social explosives that can detonate anywhere," he said.</p>
        <p>Until now, there has been relatively little unrest stemming directly from deteriorating economic conditions in eastern Germany. But in Gera, an industrial city of 130,000, it was reported today that thousands of workers demonstrated to protest a decision to end about 3,500 of 4,000 jobs at Elektronikon, an electronics manufacturer that is Gera's largest employer.</p>
