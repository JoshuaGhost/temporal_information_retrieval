        <p>Oil prices tumbled nearly $2 a barrel yesterday as traders focused on market supplies in the absence of significant news from the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Crude for December delivery closed down $1.96 a barrel, at $31.16, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than erasing Tuesday's $1.25 gain. Later-month contracts also fell.</p>
        <p>Energy market analysts said there was little significant news on the confrontation with Iraq, which has been the focus of trading activity since early August.</p>
        <p>Instead, ample supplies heading into the winter months pushed crude oil prices downward, said Christian Gohler, a vice president and trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.</p>
        <p>Weekly figures issued by the American Petroleum Institute after the close of trading on Tuesday showed strong domestic supplies, indicating that the United States energy stockpile was not now threatened by the crisis.</p>
        <p>The Washington-based trade group reported a crude supply of 345.4 million barrels as of the week ended Nov. 9, up from 344.8 million a week earlier but down slightly from 347.1 million a year ago. Stockpiles of gasoline and home heating oil were also plentiful.</p>
        <p>The oil market has fluctuated on the basis of traders' perceptions of whether war in the Middle East is imminent. An armed conflict would threaten world oil supplies and drive prices up.</p>
        <p>Crude oil prices gained on Tuesday on strong war words by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. But market fundamentals like supplies and other technical factors played a larger role yesterday.</p>
        <p>"As weeks go by and people are more comfortable with the situation -- to the extent that they feel war is not immediately around the corner -- those become more important in decision making," Mr. Gohler said.</p>
        <p>"From a fundamental point of view, the market is certainly relatively weak if you look at the numbers," he said.</p>
        <p>President Bush clashed yesterday with leaders of Congress who were trying to limit his war-making powers but he assured lawmakers that he had not decided to use military force to push Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gohler said the petroleum institute's statistics showing supplies of home heating oil 13 million barrels higher than a year earlier pushed down prices in that market.</p>
        <p>December-delivery contracts for wholesale home heating oil traded on the Merc fell 1.63 cents a gallon, to 86.64 cents, after rising 1.75 cents Tuesday. Later-month contracts also fell.</p>
        <p>Unleaded gasoline tumbled 2.72 cents a gallon, to 80.39 cents, with later months also lower. Natural gas rose 0.17 cent per 1,000 cubic feet at $2.428 after rising 0.1 cent Tuesday. Later-month contracts were mixed.</p>
