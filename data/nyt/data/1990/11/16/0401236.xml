        <p>Responding to criticism that it had delayed announcing a lifesaving treatment for people with AIDS, the Federal Government yesterday issued a defense in the form of an elaborate chronology of the events that occurred over a five-month period before letters were sent to doctors informing them of the treatment.</p>
        <p>The Government says that after a panel of experts determined in May that the treatment saved lives it then had to work out details like the proper dosages and the particular patients who would be helped. In any event, officials say, the treatment was publicized while the group was debating.</p>

        <p>Responding to criticism that it had delayed announcing a lifesaving treatment for people with AIDS, the Federal Government yesterday issued a defense in the form of an elaborate chronology of the events that occurred over a five-month period before letters were sent to doctors informing them of the treatment.</p>
        <p>The Government says that after a panel of experts determined in May that the treatment saved lives it then had to work out details like the proper dosages and the particular patients who would be helped. In any event, officials say, the treatment was publicized while the group was debating.</p>
        <p>But many practicing physicians with AIDS patients said they had never heard of the treatment, and critics said the delay was still unreasonable.</p>
        <p>The treatment was a surprising one, based on a finding that steroid hormones, which actually suppress the immune system, can cut in half the death rate for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the major killer of people with AIDS. Dramatic Gains Found</p>
        <p>On May 15, a panel of 16 AIDS specialists and statisticians was convened in San Diego by the National Institutes of Health and the University of California at San Diego to review data from five unpublished studies of the treatment. Four of the five studies showed dramatic positive results from the steroid treatment, and the panel immediately concluded that steroids were effective.</p>
        <p>Yet it was not until Oct. 15 that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases formally notified doctors of this finding, and even then it mailed letters to just 2,500 of them. During the discussions that took place since the May meeting, two panel members said, some of the researchers voiced concerns about releasing their data in advance of publicity, fearing that if they did so that would preclude publication in a prestigious medical journal. Most such journals have an embargo policy in which they will not publish a paper whose principal results have already been made known.</p>
        <p>In reaction to news of this delay, published Wednesday in The New York Times, the institute of infectious diseases released the chronology and members of the panel also gave their views of the delay. Reaching a Consensus</p>
        <p>According to the institute, the panel took three months to reach a consensus because its members "felt it was essential that the statement contain sufficient evidence from the five studies to assure credibility in the scientific community." But the bulk of the data from the five studies were available by the May 15 meeting and, according to the chronology, the time since was spent in communications among the panel members.</p>
        <p>The allergy institute also said the delay in reaching a consensus was moot because the findings were announced in various forums, such as at an international AIDS conference held in San Francisco in June and in The Annals of Internal Medicine, which published one of the five studies on July 1. But the published study was the least persuasive of the five, since it showed no improvement in survival of the patients treated with steroids, although they did breathe better.</p>
        <p>The panel's chairman, Dr. Henry Masur, chief of the critical care medicine department at the National Institutes of Health, wrote an editorial accompanying the publication of the paper giving a "tentative recommendation" to use steroids. Studies with more favorable results were in hand, he noted, but "definitive conclusions and recommendations must await final analysis and peer review."</p>
        <p>In any case, many physicians said the editorial was not effective in getting out the word on the new treatment, since they missed those announcements.</p>
        <p>Dr. Masur said yesterday that the panel moved with speed in coming to a final consensus on Aug. 31. "I think it's impressive that it got done as rapidly as it did," Dr. Masur said.</p>
        <p>Asked why panel members, having decided that use of steroids resulted in a 50 percent reduction in mortality, did not simply sequester themselves with the data until they had reached final agreement, Dr. Masur said members simply did not have the time to devote to a single-minded pursuit of a consensus.</p>
        <p>"All the people are involved in a lot of other issues," he said. "They are in crucial managerial roles and they cannot be sequestered in meetings," he explained.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Meier, a statistician at the University of Chicago who was vice chairman of the panel, said yesterday that he thought the group could have worked faster but that he believed the news about the steroid treatment was getting out anyway.  Concerns About Publication</p>
        <p>Besides discussing the data, Dr. Meier noted, some panel members with yet-to-be published papers on the subject also expressed concerns about jeopardizing their chances of having the papers accepted in prestigious medical journals. For example, Dr. Meier said, one panel member declared, "This must not come out until my paper is published" Dr. Meier declined to name the panel member.</p>
        <p>Dr. Masur said "there were a lot of discussions" about how and when to coordinate the publication of the papers and the panel's consensus statement, but these did not delay the panel in its work.</p>
        <p>The allergy institute also explained in its chronology that The New England Journal of Medicine accepted the final consensus statement for publication on Sept. 11, and waived its usual embargo on prepublication release, saying the institute could hold a news conference to announce the findings. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the institute, decided instead to send a letter about the findings to 2,500 doctors on a list supplied by the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company.</p>
        <p>The chronology said that the reason for Dr. Fauci's decision not to hold a news conference was to "avert criticism that we are distributing too little information or data that has not been peer reviewed." Dr. Fauci did not return calls to his office yesterday.  Letter Submitted as Courtesy</p>
        <p>After the decision to prepare a letter, the panel members spent from Sept. 27 to Oct. 5 drafting the three-page letter to send to doctors. On Oct. 5, they submitted the letter to The New England Journal of Medicine for approval, which came on Oct. 9. A spokeswoman said the letter was submitted as a courtesy to the journal.</p>
        <p>The two papers and the consensus statement will appear in the journal on Nov. 22.</p>
        <p>Some doctors insist that the delays were immaterial because they did hear news of the treatment from researchers. Dr. Donald Abrams, an AIDS researcher at San Francicsco General Hospital said he and his colleagues learned of the consensus immediately, since three of the panel members were from his group and began rapidly to spread the word.</p>
        <p>But other doctors did not receive the news. "I heard nothing about it," said Dr. Devra Marcus, an internist in Washington who treats AIDS patients.</p>
        <p>Even some doctors who are part of the AIDS network said they were in the dark. "I had heard nothing about it," said Dr. Bernard Bihari, executive director of the Community Research Initiative, a group of private doctors in New York that tests new treatments for AIDS. "A lot of community doctors were very concerned" about whether or not to give pneumonia patients steroids, he added.</p>
        <p>Describing the delay as "very sad," he said: "There must have been hundreds of people whose lives would have been saved if the information had gotten out earlier. I think that researchers have to live in the real world of people who are sick and dying every day. There seems to have been a lack of the emotional understanding of the urgency."</p>
