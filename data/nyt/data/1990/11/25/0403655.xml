        <p>About 30,000 demonstrators rallied to back Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov today, one day after he narrowly survived a no-confidence vote. Opponents of his Socialist Government blocked a main boulevard in protest.</p>
        <p>Some fights broke out between Government supporters and opponents, but hundreds of police officers intervened to prevent serious clashes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lukanov told the crowd that he was "no coward" and accused the opposition of trying "to establish a new political monopoly." He was among a group of Communist Party leaders who toppled the longtime ruler Todor Zhivkov last year, renamed the party and oversaw parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>The parliamentary vote on Friday followed months of wrangling between the former Communists and the opposition on how to turn around the moribund economy and end the country's political paralysis.</p>
        <p>The Government's failure to stop the economic decline and improve supplies of foods and consumer goods led to demands for Mr. Lukanov's resignation from frustrated citizens, who demonstrated each day of the last week.</p>
        <p>Despite having survived the vote, his Socialist Government faces more pressure from the main opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces. The opposition has calling for a mass demonstration in Sofia on Sunday, and a trade union confederation has called a general strike for Monday if Mr. Lukanov does not resign by then.</p>
