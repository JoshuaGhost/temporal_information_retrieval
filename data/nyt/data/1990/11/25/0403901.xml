        <p>AFTER more than three months and a commitment of almost 400,000 American soldiers, the Bush Administration and its Arab allies still wonder how to get Saddam Hussein's undivided attention.</p>
        <p>The question last week in Washington, at the pan-European summit meeting in Paris and in Arab capitals was whether the Iraqi President gets the message: Withdraw from Kuwait and free all hostages, immediately and unconditionally, or face what President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has called the "greatest concentration of military force I have ever seen in the area."</p>

        <p>AFTER more than three months and a commitment of almost 400,000 American soldiers, the Bush Administration and its Arab allies still wonder how to get Saddam Hussein's undivided attention.</p>
        <p>The question last week in Washington, at the pan-European summit meeting in Paris and in Arab capitals was whether the Iraqi President gets the message: Withdraw from Kuwait and free all hostages, immediately and unconditionally, or face what President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has called the "greatest concentration of military force I have ever seen in the area."</p>
        <p>"It seems to me he doesn't realize the danger," Mr. Mubarak said, searching for a rational explanation for President Hussein's adamantly consistent position of wanting to talk to the United States while refusing to withdraw from Kuwait.</p>
        <p>"Not until he feels the heat of the edge of the knife at the back of his neck will he withdraw," said Taseen Bashir, a former Egyptian official.</p>
        <p>Last week, the knife finally became visible, if not yet hot, as the Soviet Union signaled its willingess to work with the United States to draft a Security Council resolution that force can be used unless Iraq leaves. The Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, refused to say Monday that he would support such a resolution. But on Tuesday Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said "the time has come" for the United Nations to decide whether Iraq is ready to heed the world's demands that it withdraw from Kuwait, and to "adopt new resolutions" if it will not.</p>
        <p>The kind of resolution the United States wants, authorizing force to expel Iraq, could supply the real heat of the knife, and this has alarmed countries that opposed the American presence in the region in the first place -- especially Jordan and Algeria, and Yemen, which will hold the Security Council chairmanship next month. Mohammed Sahnoun, the diplomatic adviser to Algeria's President, Chadli Benjedid, said the pressure on Mr. Hussein "should not mean an actual blow rather than a credible threat." Algeria and others that share the goal of getting Iraq out of Kuwait but reject the use of force have tried through quiet diplomacy to persuade Iraq to leave. Most of their mediating efforts are known to the United States, which quietly approves. Little Rancor</p>
        <p>In fact, there has been surprisingly little rancor between Washington and its Arab critics. The United States has even tried to help patch up Arab quarrels over Riyadh's invitation to foreign forces to defend it, Arab leaders said. During his recent visit, for example, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d urged the Saudis to resume oil deliveries to Jordan. In interviews before President Bush visited the region last week, senior officials of Jordan, Yemen and Algeria described relations with Washington as good, despite strains over how and when to force Iraq out of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Most Arab governments do not criticize the Bush Administration for failing to detect in advance the danger Iraq posed to Kuwait. Nor do they echo arguments heard earlier in the region about America's lack of "stamina," assessments frequently aired after the United States left Lebanon within a few months of the 1983 bombing of the Marine compound in Beirut and a subsequent showdown with Syria.</p>
        <p>In the current crisis, these Arabs have instead been impressed by President Bush's ability to sustain the anti-Iraq coalition, which they had predicted would be destroyed by tactical disputes and divergent interests. Supporters of the coalition, in particular, cite the deft handling of the Chinese and the Soviets, the effort to include Syria and the steady escalation of pressure on Baghdad. What this region respects, they say, is strength. And the Americans are being seen as people who will no longer cut and run, as they are perceived to have done in Vietnam and Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Algeria, Jordan and Yemen do not share this view. Their officials express anger about what King Hussein of Jordan last week called America's "double standard" toward Israeli and Iraqi occupation of Arab land. In a speech, the King cited the many resolutions passed over many years urging Israel to withdraw from occupied lands; none, he said, was backed by American troops. Officials in Algiers, Amman and Sana are not interested in discussing the differences between Iraq's aggression and how Israel came to occupy Palestinian land. "The new international order you are trying to build must begin with Israel if it is to have any credibility among Arabs," said Sid Ahmed Ghozali, Algeria's Foreign Minister.</p>
        <p>In addition, these officials argue that force will bring chaos to the region and have other effects that Washington underestimates. "The push toward democracy in this region will be a casualty of force," Mr. Ghozali warned. These officials criticized the Bush Administration's unwillingess to offer President Hussein what they call "face savers" -- terms that the Administration has dismissed as "rewards for aggression." A senior Arab official said that President Hussein recently told the Soviet envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, that unconditional withdrawal would mean death or the overthrow of his Government.</p>
        <p>Moreover, critics of United States policy doubt that America's ultimate goal is limited to forcing Iraq out of Kuwait. They cite other objectives, such as insuring access to and a low price for oil, and insuring that Iraq does not threaten Israel. "The Bush Administration wants to destroy Iraq as a military power," said one Arab leader. "Kuwait, for you, is a mere pretext."</p>
        <p>The difference between war and peace may well depend on which Arabs are right -- those who think a credible threat will, in the end, persuade Mr. Hussein, and those who say only concessions can work.</p>
