        <p>A CZECH journalist, asked recently to examine the puzzling absence of women from public life in Eastern Europe's new democracies, offered a simple explanation. "Maids," she said, and she was only half joking. "The day we have someone to help us will be the day we have the time and energy to get into politics."</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed with problems close to home, women in Eastern Europe have been strangely silent during the last year of sweeping changes, even as they face the possibility of losing much of whatever they may have gained during 40 years of socialism. The revolutions that toppled Communist regimes throughout the region have left women in a paradoxical situation, only tenuously retaining equal rights and generous benefits that some now say they never wanted, but still way behind in the more basic fight for a place in traditional male-dominated societies.</p>

        <p>A CZECH journalist, asked recently to examine the puzzling absence of women from public life in Eastern Europe's new democracies, offered a simple explanation. "Maids," she said, and she was only half joking. "The day we have someone to help us will be the day we have the time and energy to get into politics."</p>
        <p>Overwhelmed with problems close to home, women in Eastern Europe have been strangely silent during the last year of sweeping changes, even as they face the possibility of losing much of whatever they may have gained during 40 years of socialism. The revolutions that toppled Communist regimes throughout the region have left women in a paradoxical situation, only tenuously retaining equal rights and generous benefits that some now say they never wanted, but still way behind in the more basic fight for a place in traditional male-dominated societies.</p>
        <p>As many women here will say without the least prompting, they are tired -- tired of doing two jobs, one at home, one at work, and tired of trying to figure out whether they were beneficiaries or victims of Communism's enforced egalitarianism. For the region's few active feminists, the dilemma now is how to get women to speak out on their own behalf, in the new conditions of democracy.</p>
        <p>So far, no broad-based women's movements have sprung to life in Eastern Europe -- a curious silence in a period when more peripheral groups have managed to make themselves heard. Relatively few women have been elected to the newly democratic parliaments, typically less than 10 percent. The top echelons of government in Hungary and Romania are exclusively male; in Poland, only the Minister of Culture is a woman. In all the countries, even women candidates have a hard time locating the women's vote on the political map.</p>
        <p>"We tried to bring up the role of women during the campaign last spring," said Rozse Hodosan, a member of the Hungarian parliament from the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, "but we realized quickly that people were not interested. We did much better sticking to issues like land, real estate and economics."</p>
        <p>As these countries make the transition to a free market economy, women are in danger of losing the job security, generous maternity benefits and other social guarantees that had been the hallmark of the old order, whatever its defects in other regards.</p>
        <p>In most countries, an overwhelming proportion of women work; in Hungary, for instance, the figure is 80 percent, many of them in middle management and in light industry, two fields bound to be buffeted in the coming economic storms. In the Polish city of Lodz, for instance, which manufactures synthetic materials primarily for the Soviet and Eastern European market, the work force is almost entirely female, and highly vulnerable to mass layoffs.</p>
        <p>"I don't think women realize that the tide is turning," said Zsuzsa Ferge, a sociologist at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest.</p>
        <p>By law, each Hungarian woman gets a 24-week maternity leave at full pay, followed by a three-year leave at partial salary, with a promise that her job will be there when she returns to work.</p>
        <p>"No market economy is going to guarantee a job after a three-year absence," Mrs. Ferge said. There are also liberal policies for parents with sick children -- 84 days a year for children under 3, 42 days for children between 3 and 6, with these allowances doubled for single parents.</p>
        <p>The Association of Hungarian Women, an organization that succeeded the old Communist Women's Council, predicts that as unemployment rises, women will be proportionately more affected than men, and not only because their jobs are more expendable. Sex discrimination, which always existed, has become more explicit; the association has taken issue with ads that specifically seek male applicants, and it is offering legal help to women who feel that they were let go, or not promoted, because of their sex.</p>
        <p>In Belgrade, a human rights campaigner and feminist, Sonja Licht, has a similar concern. "Already there is a tendency to think that the women must be sent home," she said. "If you have to choose who is going to lose a job, then of course, you would choose women first, because, after all, they are mothers anyway." The Abortion Battle  More Influence For the Church</p>
        <p>In addition to the economic shakedown, women face resurgent nationalist movements that advance the notion that the best place for women is at home, caring for the next generation of Hungarians, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, or whatever national group is perceived to be in danger of being outnumbered or somehow diminished.</p>
        <p>In some countries, this argument has reinforced a church-backed move to restrict abortion, which throughout Eastern Europe had become a chief means of birth control in the absence of a reliable supply of contraceptive devices. The anti-abortion movement has been strongest in Poland, where politicians, faced with the power of the Catholic Church, are apparently unfazed by polls showing that most women are against a proposed ban on abortion that has already cleared the Polish Senate, with the only real opposition coming from the discredited Communists.</p>
        <p>In Yugoslavia, an abortion battle is shaping up in the Croatian republic, where the Catholic Church is a political force, while in Serbia, where nationalism has taken a particularly virulent form, married couples with no children are being threatened with a punitive tax.</p>
        <p>"Conservative attitudes towards women are resurfacing throughout Eastern Europe, usually with strong ties to nationalism," said Ms. Licht. "I often call the newly emerging democracies male democracies."</p>
        <p>In Hungary, early hints from the ruling center-right Government that it might target abortion have galvanized women's groups as no other issue has managed to do. Polls have shown that 85 percent of Hungarian women oppose any restrictions on their right to abortion, although the practice of abortion is, paradoxically, less prevalent here than in Poland."Abortion is not a pleasure, it is not something anyone wants," said Judit Thorma, president of the Association of Hungarian Women, "but a woman must have the right to get the help she needs. Without abortion, women are slaves.</p>
        <p>"Women's groups in Hungary are divided on many things, but on abortion we are united," Mrs. Thorma said. "If it comes up in Parliament, we will be ready with questionnaires and petitions. And if we are not successful in this way, then we will -- if necessary -- go out onto the streets."Yet Mrs. Thorma agreed that for the most part women in Hungary have sat out this round of democratic transformation.</p>
        <p>"Women are suspicious of democracy and a little withdrawn," she said. "For 40 years, they had a hard life, with few good results. Now, they have no time for politics, and no interest. They want to wait until they see some results."</p>
        <p>Even among women politicians, there is a reluctance to coordinate efforts as women on behalf of women. Of the 25 women in the Hungarian Parliament, only 10 were interested in forming a women's caucus, according to Zsuzsanna Szelenyi, a member of Parliament with the Federation of Young Democrats. Even within her own party, Ms. Szelenyi said, the idea of a women's committee was rejected, partly because of young women's distaste for the public image of the women's movement in the West.</p>
        <p>Such passivity has roots in the traditional rural cultures that still predominate in much of this troubled region, but also in the conflicting legacy left by Communist rule. Long before it was true in Western Europe, working women were the norm in Eastern Europe; university admissions were equally distributed between men and women, and women were more proportionately represented in public life -- with, for instance, at least 30 percent of the seats in most parliaments. In Romania, professional women got an indirect boost from Elena Ceausescu, who successfully manipulated her husband's dictatorial powers to enhance her own image, and by extension that of her sex. This undeserved homage helped feed a counter reaction and, some Romanians say, the defeat of many women candidates in elections this year. Of 397 members of the House of Deputies only 21 are women, and of the 119 members of the Senate only one is a woman.</p>
        <p>In Hungary, too, some see a similar rejection of the window-dressing women provided for the Communist system. "People looked with suspicion on women in responsible positions, and figured they had to be there because of their party connections," said Katalin Filo, a member of the Hungarian Parliament from the Hungarian Democratic Forum, now the country's leading party.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of women's achievements under Communism looked better in government pamphlets than they did in real life. With notable exceptions, women were often shunted into feminized professions, such as teaching or medicine, where both the pay and the prestige were correspondingly low. Throughout the economy, the sexes assumed their places; for instance, women were bookkeepers, men were economic managers. Overall, the difference in pay was 20 to 30 percent. In politics, women were assigned quotas and regarded as decoration. Even the benefits women accumulated were part and parcel of a welfare state, handed out to make up for an overall dismal standard of living. Embracing Old Values  The Freedom Not to Work</p>
        <p>Now women are engaged in a new debate: Was their experience over the last 40 years exploitation or emancipation? Many now argue that women were made to work, often at demeaning jobs, at the expense of themselves and their families. Now, they say, the goal should be to create an economy where women do not have to work -- a view that dovetails with the rising emphasis on the importance of traditional values, large families and religion.</p>
        <p>"In the last 40 years, women have been dragged out of the family and forced to work," said Mrs. Filo, whose party has been a proponent of preserving Hungarian values. Now, said Mrs. Filo, the goal should be to make sure men can support their families, allowing women to choose, if they want, not to work and to raise large families, thus helping the nation restore its identity.</p>
        <p>And yet, others argue, women did manage to score some real achievements in the Communist period, the most important being financial autonomy. This is particularly significant in countries where the divorce rate is high -- Hungary has the fourth highest divorce rate in Europe after the Soviet Union, the old East Germany and the United Kingdom -- since it means women, left alone to bring up their children, are able to do so without sinking into poverty.</p>
        <p>Some benefits, particularly those connected to children, are likely to remain protected in the new era. Despite a mounting budget deficit, Hungary for instance is raising monthly state family allowances, now set at about $33 per child, to offset the 30 percent inflation rate.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that whatever achievements women reached in this period, they did so without feelings of accomplishment. "Because the political system was what it was, women felt these things were forced on them," said Mrs. Ferge. "Therefore, many will tell you that they worked because they had to, not because they wanted to, when in fact they say this because they felt powerless." Beyond Economics  Seeking a Life Outside the Home</p>
        <p>Work provided women not only with money, but also with a life outside the home, a chance to prove and express themselves and to gain an identity of their own. To preserve these options for those who also want more time for their families and children, women's rights campaigners are trying to open a debate on a range of new options that would include more part-time jobs, job sharing and a chance for professionals to resume their careers after their children are grown.</p>
        <p>"We have equal rights written in the law," said Mrs. Thorma, "but the idea of equal opportunity is still not written in people's minds, not just men but women."</p>
        <p>In Eastern Europe, the writing of equal rights into the law was never accompanied by any attempt to change assumptions about how men and women should divide their roles in society. As a result, women ended up with two jobs, one at work and the other at home, and that led to the kind of bone-tiredness that afflicts women of all ages. Household chores and child-rearing are still seen as women's work -- a notion that women may challenge over a sinkful of dirty dishes, but not in a public arena.</p>
        <p>Even Mrs. Hodosan, married to Gabor Demszky, Budapest's newly elected liberal mayor, said that while her husband has been supportive of her political career, there are times when even he turns to her with complaints about an empty refrigerator or an untidy apartment."This was a macho society and it still is," said Mrs. Ferge, "and women have never revolted against machoism, even when the opportunity came our way."</p>
        <p>Now, with the new freedoms and a wide-open political arena, one such opportunity may have arrived. But many women worry that with economies in turmoil, and ethnic tensions rising, this may not be the best time to tackle women's issues.</p>
        <p>"Women have so many worries that the least of them is whether they are emanicipated," said Mrs. Ferge. "The first is where to buy milk for the children. For now, politics for them is a luxury. When we have normal politics, then we will have a normal number of women in politics."</p>
