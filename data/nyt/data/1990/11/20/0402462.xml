        <p>The public statements and bold smiles of the leaders gathered for the summit of 34 nations were generally as glittering as the city that provided the backdrop.

        <p>The public statements and bold smiles of the leaders gathered for the summit of 34 nations were generally as glittering as the city that provided the backdrop. But many a participant might have been distracted by private thoughts on a more pedestrian level, given the problems waiting at home.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for one, was all smiles and trademark confidence as she strolled from the British Ambassador's residence a few doors down to Elysee Palace for lunch. Yet she must have wondered at times whether she might not be out on the street for good if she is defeated in a brutal leadership struggle in her Conservative Party on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>"It is not time to write my memoirs yet," she declared.</p>
        <p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the proclaimed hero of the proceedings as the man who conceived of the summit and whose policies made it possible, must have had a few things on his mind, too. He had left Moscow after assuming broad new powers to combat the disintegration of his land, and his spokesmen had their work cut out trying to conceal how little they really knew of what was happening.</p>
        <p>What sort of government did Mr. Gorbachev envision? "Something between the American and French system," explained Georgi K. Shakhnazarov, a member of the President's Council, at a Soviet briefing of the media. "It won't be a federation, nor a confederation, but some form of union of independent republics."  Barring the Baltic Three</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Shakhnazarov spoke, three of the candidates for that union were venting their spleen at a news conference across town. The foreign ministers of the three independence-minded Baltic republics -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- had come here thinking they would at least sit in on the party as "distinguished guests of the French Government."</p>
        <p>But when they showed up, they were told they were being barred because all decisions were taken by consensus, and somebody had objected to their presence. The three officials bitterly blamed the Soviet Union for their exclusion, but few of the other participants seemed in a mood to further undermine Mr. Gorbachev by publicly backing the Balts.</p>
        <p>"We didn't have any illusions," said Foreign Minister Lennart Meri of Estonia. "We knew that the way back to Europe would be the long way."  The Helsinki Perspective</p>
        <p>If the assembled leaders start thinking too much about problems of politics, protocol and proportions, there is a bit of history that might provide some sobering perspective.</p>
        <p>The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose summit meeting this is, is a direct descendant of the 1975 meeting in Helsinki at which 35 heads of state and Government signed the "Final Act" outlining guidelines for peace, cooperation and human rights.</p>
        <p>Of those who were present in Helsinki, however, only one came to Paris:Agostino Cardinal Casaroli of the Vatican.</p>
        <p>Of the others, according to a list compiled by Reuters, 12 are dead, including Leonid I. Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, whose idea the summit had been. Two were assassinated -- Aldo Moro of Italy and Olof Palme of Sweden -- and one was executed -- Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania.</p>
        <p>One of the original countries, the German Democratic Republic, has vanished. A Matter of Protocol</p>
        <p>A major function of the summit, in fact, is to affirm the arrival of a united Germany as a full and sovereign member of the family of nations. It was unclear, however, at least to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whether that made the powerful new united Germany first or last.</p>
        <p>Protocol called for leaders to arrive at Elysee Palace in reverse protocol order -- heads of government followed by heads of state followed by those who were heads of state and government.</p>
        <p>President Bush was to arrive last. But in fact, Mr. Kohl arrived last, leaving onlookers to wonder whether he got his signals mixed, whether he was just not punctual or whether his Mercedes limousine broke down. All these explanations were so un-German, however, that some darker minds got to pondering whether he had decided that the last shall be first.  Security and the Insecure</p>
        <p>The extraordinary security at a summit called to mark the end of the cold war and to sign the most far-reaching disarmament treaty to date underscored the point made by many a leader that the new world they were introducing had its own new threats.</p>
        <p>Or, as Mr. Gorbachev put it: "We would succumb to impermissible euphoria should we conclude that a truly great accomplishment in the form of a virtual elimination of the threat of a major war in Europe has totally ruled the likelihood of sharp conflict situations in the continent."</p>
        <p>Right on cue, word came that a disgruntled Soviet soldier had gone amok in an armored personnel carrier, driving it from Potsdam into Berlin.</p>
        <p>No one was hurt in the incident, in which the Berlin police said the soldier drove for about 40 miles, including a trip through Berlin, before he was stopped by the police after ramming cars and smashing barricades.</p>
        <p>The police said later that the soldier, identified only as a 20-year-old sergeant from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, had received a letter from his girlfriend that broke his heart.</p>
