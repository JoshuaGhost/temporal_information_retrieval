        <p>Barry Bonds spent a childhood and the bulk of his major league career trying to accomplish statistical feats that would allow him to join "clubs" statistically established by his father. Yesterday, Barry Bonds entered a club that his father, Bobby, never gained access to, that belonging to major leaguers voted the most valuable player of their leagues by the Baseball Writers Association of America.</p>
        <p>Bonds, a 26-year-old left fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates, won that distinction when the writers' association announced their selection in the National League. Like his teammate, Doug Drabek, who won the Cy Young Award last week, Bonds came within one vote of making it a unanimous selection. His teammate and close friend, Bobby Bonilla, received the only first-place vote that Bonds did not get out of 24 cast.</p>

        <p>Barry Bonds spent a childhood and the bulk of his major league career trying to accomplish statistical feats that would allow him to join "clubs" statistically established by his father. Yesterday, Barry Bonds entered a club that his father, Bobby, never gained access to, that belonging to major leaguers voted the most valuable player of their leagues by the Baseball Writers Association of America.</p>
        <p>Bonds, a 26-year-old left fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates, won that distinction when the writers' association announced their selection in the National League. Like his teammate, Doug Drabek, who won the Cy Young Award last week, Bonds came within one vote of making it a unanimous selection. His teammate and close friend, Bobby Bonilla, received the only first-place vote that Bonds did not get out of 24 cast.</p>
        <p>Bonds's victory was made possible by a year of across-the-board consistency as well as the blend of power and speed that his father made a family trademark in the 60's and 70's. Although Bonds led the league in only one category -- slugging percentage (.565) -- his name was sprinkled liberally throughout league-leader categories. Bonds hit .301, slammed 33 home runs, stole 52 bases and drove in 114 runs.</p>
        <p>Father Was Third in '73</p>
        <p>The highest Bonds's father ever finished in such voting was third, in 1973, when he finished behind Pete Rose and Willie Stargell after hitting 39 home runs and stealing 43 bases.</p>
        <p>Bonds is often compared to his father, who holds a record with five seasons in the 30-30 club (at least 30 stolen bases and 30 homes runs). Between father and son, they accomplished that feat 6 of the 13 times both plateaus have been reached in one season.</p>
        <p>But the son accomplished more, much more, this past season. He was the first player in history to both score and drive in more than 100 runs, hit more than 30 home runs, steal more than 50 bases and hit over .300.</p>
        <p>"I'm very proud of that, doing something that no one else has done in the history of baseball," Bonds said.</p>
        <p>As for receiving the award, Bonds said: "It's a relief, after all my hard work in the offseason. It's just a great feeling, but I was only as good as the guys around me. The ones getting on base deserve the award, too."</p>
        <p>Tips Cap to Bonilla</p>
        <p>Bonds took care to mention one teammate in particular, Bonilla. "I wish I could split it and give half to Bobby," Bonds said. "I wish I could share it. To me, he's just as much the m.v.p. as I am."</p>
        <p>Voters saw it otherwise and Bonds outpolled Bonilla in the overall point total by 331 to 212. Darryl Strawberry finished a distant third in the voting with 167 points. Ryne Sandberg, the second baseman for the Chicago Cubs, and Eddie Murray, the first baseman for the Los Angeles Dodgers, rounded out the top five.</p>
        <p>Bonds is the first Pirate to win the award since Stargell shared the honor with Keith Hernandez of the Cardinals in 1979. Other Pirates winners were Dick Groat in 1960, Roberto Clemente in 1966 and Dave Parker in 1978.</p>
