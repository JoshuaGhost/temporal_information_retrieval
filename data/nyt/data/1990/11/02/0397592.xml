        <p>The MBNA 90-B Trust, established by MBNA America, a unit of MNC Financial, is making a $600 million global offering of certificates backed by Mastercard credit card receivables through Merrill Lynch &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The certificates carry a coupon of 8 3/4 percent and are priced at 99.59375 to yield 8.938 percent, or about 110 basis points more than the when-issued three-year Treasury note.</p>
        <p>The certificates are rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by Standard &amp; Poor's, partly on the strength of the underlying credit card receivables and a 10 percent letter of credit issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland as additional support for the financing.</p>
        <p>MBNA stands for Maryland Bank, N.A.</p>
