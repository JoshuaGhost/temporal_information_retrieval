        <p>The luck of the Irish may have extended to Charlottesville and Lincoln, where losses Saturday by Virginia and Nebraska enabled Notre Dame to reclaim the top spot in the news-agency polls. But giving up 31 points to lowly Navy dropped the Irish in The Times's computer ranking from No. 9 to No. 11.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame was placed first by both The Associated Press and United Press International, while The Times's computer put Washington, which qualified for the Rose Bowl on Saturday by routing Arizona, 54-10, on top. The Huskies occupied the second spot in both the news-agency lists.  First Losses</p>
        <p>The losses by Virginia (to Georgia Tech, 41-38, on a last-seconds field goal) and Nebraska (to Colorado, 27-12) were their first of the season and resulted in large slides in the rankings.</p>
