        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that Sharman Yoffie makes the case for adequate compensation for New York City teachers in "Quit Trashing Teachers" (Op-Ed, Nov. 10) by trashing other city employees, including those I represent -- sanitation workers.</p>
        <p>No one can dispute that teachers should be fairly compensated for the difficult and important job they perform. But the men and women who collect and dispose of the city's refuse, and who keep the city clean, also perform an essential function. Through their working careers each will walk thousands of miles and lift an equivalent weight to 17,000 cars. It's tough work, day in and day out, in the most adverse conditions, but performed by honest, hard-working, respectable people.</p>
        <p>In disparaging the work of these 7,000 men and women, Ms. Yoffie clearly -- if perhaps unconsciously -- demonstrates the true difference between "trash collectors" and teachers like herself, because we respect all workers for the jobs they do, even if those jobs are different from our own.</p>
