        <p>Two prosecutors in New York City have been nominated for Federal judgeships, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sterling Johnson Jr., the city's Special Narcotics Prosecutor for 16 years, has been nominated to the Eastern District. Louis J. Freeh, the third-ranking member of the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan and a former F.B.I. agent, was nominated to a vacancy in the Southern District, Mr. D'Amato said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh, 40, is now preparing to lead the prosecution of the Atlanta bombing case in which a Georgia man is accused of mailing bombs to a Federal judge and a civil rights attorney, killing both.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, 56, was a city police officer from 1956 to 1967 and a Federal prosecutor for three years after leaving the force.</p>
        <p>Asked if he could fight drugs as effectively as a judge, Mr. Johnson said: "Power is not the name of the game. Now it's time to make another kind of contribution."</p>
