        <p>Berlin said today that a huge stockpile of food built up by West Berlin in case of a cold war crisis would be sent to help the Soviet Union, the power that once blockaded the city.</p>
        <p>Berlin said it was ready to send the 300,000 metric tons of food and other supplies worth $480 million to its former enemy.</p>
        <p>The only outstanding question was how to move the goods from 280 warehouses across the city to their destination.</p>
        <p>West Berlin established its emergency stockpile in 1953, four years after enduring a yearlong blockade of the enclave city by the Soviet Union and its East German ally.</p>
