        <p>Since Aug. 2, our attention to events beyond our borders has been confined largely to the Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf. In recent days, our preoccupation with Iraq has been magnified by the debate that was triggered by President Bush's announcement of new U.S. military deployments to the region.</p>
        <p>However, three other ominous foreign policy problems -- serious energy shortfalls in Eastern Europe; severe food shortages in the Soviet Union and the chronic ills of the Middle East -- lurk just over the horizon. These problems lack the immediacy of the gulf crisis but if left unaddressed could spawn crises of even greater magnitude.</p>
        <p>While the countries of Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, face potentially crippling energy shortfalls, their traditional supplier, the Soviet Union, is suffering its own oil production and energy problems. In addition, Moscow says it will soon shift to world prices and hard currency in its trade with former client states, which could mean billions in additional fuel costs for Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>These countries had planned to receive Iraqi oil in payment for past sales of Eastern European arms and other exports to Iraq. For the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, the U.N. embargo means we will not buy oil from Iraq. For Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the embargo means these countries will not receive the oil Iraq already owes them.</p>
        <p>The world community cannot neglect Eastern Europe as it struggles to overcome an impending energy crisis that could doom its quest for market economies and even jeopardize its emerging democracies.</p>
        <p>In addition to asking the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to increase assistance to Eastern Europe, which the Administration is doing, I believe Saudi Arabia and our other friends among the oil producing states should be called upon to help. This should not pose an undue burden to the oil producers. Saudi Arabia alone has already realized a windfall profit of about $16 billion to $20 billion from higher oil prices and increased oil output.</p>
        <p>We should urge the Japanese to help Eastern Europe with grants and low interest long-term loans, preferably through international organizations. This could be a much more meaningful Japanese contribution to stability than sending a few thousand Japanese troops to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>As for the likelihood of serious food shortages in the Soviet Union, here is how a leading Soviet economic expert describes the domestic economic situation: "The market has collapsed, the budget deficit is dreadful . . . monetary circulation and the financial system are on the brink of complete disaster." Against this gloomy backdrop, much of the fall harvest has been lost because of bad weather, poor transportation and inadequate storage and processing facilities. Moreover, because the ruble has become virtually worthless, farmers are refusing to sell their output to the central Government.</p>
        <p>Should we help the Soviet people overcome a potential crisis of food supply as they struggle to move from a command to a market economy, from dictatorial one-party rule to representative democracy? The answer is yes: Chaos in a nation that possesses 10,000 nuclear weapons is not in our national security interests.</p>
        <p>Two measures would help us as well as the Soviet Union. We should bring the recently initialed U.S.-Soviet trade agreement into force and waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which denies the Soviets most- favored nation treatment and U.S. Government credits. The President has said he would not initiate waiver action until the Soviet Parliament passes a suitable law governing emigration. Though the Parliament has not yet done this, Soviet emigration to Israel and other countries is booming. Free emigration is why the Jackson-Vanik amendment was originally passed. President Bush should forget the formalities and deal with the realities.</p>
        <p>Waiver, rather than repeal, of the Jackson-Vanik amendment would keep its sanctions in our arsenal, in case Soviet emigration practices take a turn for the worse. Meanwhile, such U.S. Government programs as Commodity Credit Corporation credits, intended to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural products, would be able to swing into action. This would help the American farmer and our economy while providing relief to the Soviet people as they weather a particularly difficult phase of their economic transition.</p>
        <p>Second, the Soviet Union has under-exploited proven oil reserves and inadequately explored potential oil reserves. This overall energy potential cannot be realized quickly. But it is a valuable and needed asset, and U.S. companies have the expertise to enhance current oil extraction and explore new oilfields in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The bottom line here is an exchange of the Soviet Union's energy resources for our agricultural products. To make this happen, we need to clear away outmoded legal and bureaucratic obstacles that handicap our businessmen and farmers and needlessly complicate such logical, mutually beneficial deals.</p>
        <p>The third problem is the stability of the Middle East after the gulf crisis. There are four factors that predate the current crisis and exist independently from it, but which make it more complex and dangerous: the wide gap between the have and have-not Arab states; the Arab population boom throughout the region; the lack of democracy in Arab states as well as a lack of regional economic cooperation among the Arab countries, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the problems make difficult the possibility of peaceful economic and political development within and among Arab states. The per capita gross national product in the region varies from more than $10,000 in the richest countries to under $1,000 in the poorest, with the bulk of the population living in the poorer countries.</p>
        <p>A present Arab population of something over 200 million could swell to some 500 million by the year 2025, placing unprecedented demands on limited resources, including water. And at the moment there is neither a genuine working democracy among the Arab countries nor any significant regional economic cooperation among them. Interrelated problems of this magnitude defy easy solution. There is an encouraging historical precedent, however.</p>
        <p>In the late 1940's, the United States responded to economic stagnation in Western Europe with the Marshall Plan, which offered economic assistance once the European countries developed a common plan for economic recovery. Despite the obvious differences between postwar Europe and today's Middle East, the Arab countries need to think in terms of a similar area-wide approach, financed primarily by the region's oil exporting countries.</p>
        <p>Regional cooperation should help to ease population pressures and vast economic disparities among Arab states, which taken together with the absence of democratic government contain the seeds of desperation and confrontation. The United States and other democracies should work with the countries of the Middle East to assist their transition to genuinely representative government.</p>
        <p>Regional stability cannot be achieved, however, without settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is no time for high-profile initiatives that could exacerbate tensions between the Israelis and Arabs. But at some point the conflict will have to be settled through negotiations. Left unattended, the Arab-Israeli problem polarizes and radicalizes the peoples of the region. It provides cover for militarization and military rule in the area. It fuels an ever more lethal regional arms race.</p>
        <p>This problem is distinct from the gulf crisis created by Saddam Hussein. Yet out of the current crisis could come a coalition of Arab nations willing to pursue peace directly with Israel. The goal of quiet and creative U.S. diplomacy should be to facilitate renewal and success of the peace process, in the light of changing Middle East realities. Benign neglect is not an acceptable option.</p>
