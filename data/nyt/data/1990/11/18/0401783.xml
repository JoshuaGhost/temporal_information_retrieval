        <p>HERE in the land of new beginnings, what might be called the end of politics has begun.</p>
        <p>A new Governor waits in the wings, having been elected by the lowest turnout in California history. Members of the State Legislature return to work next month, having had their budgets, staffs and terms clipped by angry voters. And if representative democracy has approached paralysis in California, the voters have also spurned the alternative, direct democracy by voter initiative, at least for now. This month, in a spasm of exasperation, confusion and resentment against new taxes, the voters said 'no' to almost everything on their ballot; one of the few exceptions was the proposition putting sharp limits on the terms of their representatives and leaders in Sacramento.</p>
        <p>If, as the cliche goes, California leads the nation in trends, few would want to follow now when it comes to government. Chronic optimism has changed to pessimism in this state of irrepressible prosperity, the Golden State, which has reached a population of 29.3 million and is expected to grow by more than half a million people a year if recent trends persist. And if they find smog, congestion and crime at the end of the California rainbow, it is not clear that political leadership can help.</p>
        <p>Nor does it seem that anyone can break the gridlock into which circumstances have forced the state government. "I try to be an optimist, a reformer," said Walter A. Zelman, former executive director of California Common Cause. "But I think we are in for a very bleak political period."</p>
        <p>On Election Day, the voters of California seemed to say to their lawmakers: We pay you to write our laws. Don't make us do it. At the same time they took much of the legislators' power away, by imposing lifetime term limits of six years in the Assembly and eight years in the Senate and cutting their budgets by about 40 percent. Already, many senior lawmakers are looking for other work or offices to run for.</p>
        <p>Most political scientists agree that this has shifted the balance of power from the Democratic-controlled Legislature toward the Republican Governor-elect, Senator Pete Wilson.</p>
        <p>All of this represents something of a reversal of a generation-long trend in California government. From a corrupt amateur Legislature that could be bought for the price of lunch from the famed lobbyist Artie Samish, who ultimately was convicted of tax evasion in 1953, the Legislature was turned into a full-time professional body in 1966 under the late Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Jesse M. Unruh. That trend spread nationwide.</p>
        <p>"But we have now entered into a phase of weakening of the Legislature, and the Governor's office may try to pick up the slack," said Prof. Bruce Cain of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wilson faces no picnic. He is regarded as a moderate and expected to work much more closely with the Legislature in Sacramento than the fiscally conservative Republican incumbent, George Deukmejian, but he is not fully beloved among lawmakers of either party, who widely believe that it was his support for the term-limits measure, called Proposition 140, that put it over the top.</p>
        <p>The day after his victory over Dianne Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Wilson said he would "get along just fine" with the Legislature; in response, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, David Roberti of Los Angeles, said, "We are going to be sitting across the table from this guy who helped bring in this 300-pound gorilla named Prop 140, and it's going to be hard to forget that in human terms." The view was no different in the office of the powerful Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The first thing that Mr. Wilson and the Legislature will tangle over is the politically charged question of how to erase a shortfall in the state's $55 billion budget that is expected to reach $2 billion by the time Mr. Wilson takes office on Jan. 7. With tax revenues falling and demands for government services rising because of the weakening economy, it is now questionable whether Mr. Wilson can keep his campaign pledge not to raise income taxes and to respect the voters' resounding rejection of more taxes and spending. After that, he and the Legislature will face off on reapportioning Congressional districts in California, which is to gain seven seats in 1992. Amid this, hundreds of the Governor's political appointees will have to pass muster in Mr. Roberti's Senate.</p>
        <p>"The potential for public policy gridlock has never been greater," observed Mr. Roberti's spokesman, Bob Forsyth.</p>
        <p>Critics say the Legislature is gridlocked because it is excessively beholden to industry special interests for campaign funds, and the conviction of a State Senator and former Senator earlier this year on vote-selling charges in part of a widening Federal corruption investigation has done little to alter that view.</p>
        <p>Instead, voters in recent years have turned to the initiative, that especially California tool of making law by dynamite that began in 1911 as part of Gov. Hiram Johnson's Progressive Era measures to clean up government. The process remained mostly dormant until the late 1970's, when it became a "de facto branch of government," in the words of Bill Bradley, editor of New West Notes, a California political newsletter. Over and over again, voters here made law and history -- with Proposition 13 in 1978, which capped property tax increases, with Proposition 65 in 1986, which forced the labeling or reformulation of products with hazardous ingredients, with Proposition 103 in 1988, which promised to roll back insurance rates. And over those years, voters in the 22 other states that permit voters to make law by ballot intiative joined this revolution.</p>
        <p>But this year the revolution seemed to turn against the initiative process itself, which Prof. Eugene C. Lee of Berkeley calls "an idea whose time has passed." Paradoxically, this citizen tool of government has become just another tool of well financed interests that have seized on it to write law without the hindrance of legislative compromise. The growing accumulation of such initiative-passed laws has also tied the hands of the Governor and the Legislature because the ballot measures often award set budget allocations to programs that cannot be trimmed in the budget process.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 6, the voters of California rejected all but 6 of the 28 statewide initiatives and bond measures on the ballot, including the environmental initiative known as Big Green, which was once thought a sure winner, higher taxes on alcholic beverages, and even bonds for child care centers, parks, water projects and prison construction. "The despair over the lack of efficacy of government institutions has now spread to the initiative process," said Mr. Bradley.</p>
        <p>Among the few measures that passed were one that forbids use of gill nets for fishing that snare marine mammals and another that will exclude building improvements to strengthen against earthquakes from property tax assessments. Both are the California equivalent of apple pie.  No on Everything</p>
        <p>"Many people simply decided to vote no on everything, either in disgust or out of feeling that the Legislature ought to be handling this stuff," said Prof. Gordon Baker, a political scientist at the University of California's campus in Santa Barbara. "But it's ironic because the reason they are on the ballot is that the Legislature hasn't handled them."</p>
        <p>Some said that this was just a passing voter mood, that people were voting their pocketbooks, and they note that much the same happened in other states, in Virginia, Washington, Oregon. New York State's big environmental bond proposal, which would have cost $800 million, also failed.</p>
        <p>If the voters were resisting the price of the ballot initiatives rather than the idea of initiatives, this argument goes, the next California ballot will again be jammed with confusing proposals. "If there is a temporary learning, I have complete faith it will be forgotten," said Professor Cain.</p>
        <p>A movement is growing to make it more difficult to govern by ballot measure, by raising the number of signatures required, requiring them to pass pre-election technical review and permitting the Legislature and Governor to amend or repeal them after a certain time. Anticipating this, the remnants of Howard Jarvis's and Paul Gann's anti-tax and spending crusades of a decade ago put together an initiative that would have changed the California constitution to require that any change in the initiative and referendum process be approved by the voters. But that measure failed, too, by 55 percent to 45 percent.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, California continues to grow, its lure for migrants, American and foreign -- drawn by its glamor, wealth, climate, opportunities -- hardly diminished by its problems. How long this persists may well depend on whether a new Governor and newly chastened legislators can resolve their differences and get on with the public's business.</p>
