        <p>Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly arrived unexpectedly in Damascus today for talks with Syrian leaders on the Persian Gulf crisis, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly is accompanying Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on a tour of the region. Officials said he would meet with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.</p>
        <p>Diplomats expected Mr. Kelly to face tough questions from Syria on increased American military and economic aid to Israel since the outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>Syria became Washington's unlikely ally in the gulf crisis when it sent troops to join a United States-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Officials said today that the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Prince Saud al-Faisal, would come to Damascus on Friday to discuss with Mr. Sharaa how to form a united Arab front against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>"The ministers are expected to reiterate that a peaceful settlement of the gulf crisis could never be achieved unless Iraq unconditionally pulls its forces out of Kuwait and the Kuwaiti Government is reinstated," an official said.</p>
