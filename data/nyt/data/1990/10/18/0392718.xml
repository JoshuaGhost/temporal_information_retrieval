        <p>LEAD: Milwaukee's most celebrated killer and fugitive, Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenek, was arrested here today, ending three months of freedom with the fiance she met in prison.</p>
        <p>Milwaukee's most celebrated killer and fugitive, Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenek, was arrested here today, ending three months of freedom with the fiance she met in prison.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bembenek was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police after she was recognized by a restaurant patron who had seen her on Friday on the Fox television program ''America's Most Wanted,'' said Constable Andrew Rozdolsky of the Mounties.</p>
        <p>A former police trainee and Playboy Club bunny, the 31-year-old Ms. Bembenek had been working at a restaurant near the police station in Thunder Bay, the authorities said. She was arrested with Dominic A. Gugliatto, a 34-year-old factory worker from Milwaukee, in their basement apartment. The couple had met late last year while Mr. Gugliatto was visiting his sister, an inmate at the prison.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bembenek and Mr. Gugliatto are being held in a jail here on charges of not having proper visas, and are expected to have a court hearing early next week.</p>
        <p>The two had been missing since July 15, when Ms. Bembenek squeezed through a laundry room window, climbed a seven-foot barbed-wire fence and fled from the Taycheedah Correctional Institution about 60 miles north of Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bembenek's escape electrified Milwaukee, and there was considerable sentiment that she was not guilty of the killing. Hundreds of people attended rallies and benefit concerts in her honor last summer. Vendors sold ''Run Bambi Run'' T-shirts and restaurants offered specials named after her.</p>
        <p>She had been convicted in the 1981 shooting death of Christine Schultz, the former wife of the police detective to whom Ms. Bembenek was married at the time.</p>
