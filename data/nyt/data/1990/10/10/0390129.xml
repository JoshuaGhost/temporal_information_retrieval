        <p>LEAD: American yeshivas and Hebrew schools are transforming thousands of immigrant Jewish children bred in the atheistic culture of the Soviet Union into observant Jews, carrying more than a few parents along in the process.</p>
        <p>American yeshivas and Hebrew schools are transforming thousands of immigrant Jewish children bred in the atheistic culture of the Soviet Union into observant Jews, carrying more than a few parents along in the process.</p>
        <p>The metamorphosis is most palpable at the Torah Academy in Richmond Hill, Queens, where boys who just a year ago were scarcely aware they were Jewish are now wearing yarmulkes on their heads and ritual fringes dangling over their belts. But it can also be found in Atlanta, Baltimore, San Diego, Youngstown, Ohio, or any of the two-dozen communities where most of the Soviet families are settling.</p>
        <p>In this season of Jewish holy days and holidays, almost 200 immigrant boys and girls at the Torah Academy are studying the significance of the succah, the type of temporary dwelling that sheltered the biblical Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt. As in the dim and dusty cheders of a Europe that is no more, pale and dark-eyed children are learning the unfamiliar Hebrew alphabet, repeatedly chanting the letters and dotted vowels, even as they struggle to master another unfamiliar alphabet -the one used for English.</p>
        <p>Parents who never honored so basic a Jewish ritual as circumcision are, in response to challenges from their children, observing intricate dietary laws, keeping the Sabbath, learning Hebrew. Some men are asking for painful circumcision operations for themselves and their sons.</p>
        <p>The transformations have not been without their moments of family differences. In the Khanin family of Kew Gardens in Queens, Irina Khanin serves separate meat and dairy dishes and struggles to observe the Sabbath. But her husband, Victor, a geologist, must work on Saturdays, sometimes brings home food that is not kosher and is mystified by his family's religious revival. Yet, Mrs. Khanin said, he has had himself circumcised and takes deep pleasure that their sons, Dan, 15 years old, and, Michael, 10, are attending yeshivas.</p>
        <p>''I want them to have options in the future, to choose what kind of life they will lead,'' Mrs. Khanin said. ''If I cut this religious upbringing, they won't have the option to choose.''</p>
        <p>Chaya Kessler, a teacher at Akiva Academy in Youngstown, which has taken in 14 Soviet children on full scholarships, said that when parents see offspring observing Jewish customs, the memories of a grandmother's Sabbath habits may come to mind. But, Mrs. Kessler said, some ''think it's phony.''</p>
        <p>'You Become a Believer'</p>
        <p>''You were an atheist before and here you become a believer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Board of Jewish Education of Greater New York says there are 5,500 Soviet children among the 190 yeshivas and day schools, which are somewhat more secular than yeshivas, in the New York metropolitan area. They now make up almost 8 percent of the nearly 70,000 yeshiva students in the area.</p>
        <p>The numbers have spurted as a glasnost-minded Soviet leadership has recently permitted 40,000 Jews a year to emigrate, with 19,000 settling around New York. Last year, 2,200 Jewish children entered the New York yeshiva system, said David Mann, the board's executive director. By comparison, 2,500 Soviet Jewish children entered the public school system, according to the city's Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Orthodox schools are not the only ones absorbing Soviet children. On the West Side of Manhattan, the Abraham Joshua Heschel School, which draws children from Conservative, Reform, Orthodox and secular homes, took in 10 Soviet children this year and waived the more than $8,000 annual tuition for each. ''We are reacting ourselves to a group of people, who though estranged for 60 or 70 years, are the roots of American Jewry,'' said Peter Geffen, the school's founder.</p>
        <p>A Lifetime of Alienation</p>
        <p>He said he had no illusions that the Soviet immigrants would all become devoted Jews. ''We will affect a percentage of these families permanently, but we have to acknowledge the distance they have to go to overcome a lifetime worth of alienation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His comment touches the principal question hovering over the phenomenon: will it have an enduring impact?</p>
        <p>When the first Soviet Jews came to the United States in the mid 1970's, Jewish organizations furnished shelter and job training but naively assumed that education would take care of itself, just as it had for earlier generations of other immigrants. But they failed to appreciate how cut off from Judaism the Soviet immigrants had been. In fact, few children enrolled in yeshivas, and of those who did, few remained.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Mann said, recent immigrants seem more aware of their Jewish identity, probably as a result of more tolerant official Soviet attitudes toward religion. They arrive knowing there is a Jewish educational network in America, Mr. Mann said, and in some instances ask for specific schools. Families with few relatives or friends in the United States often find in yeshiva circles a sense of belonging.</p>
        <p>A Spontaneous Effort</p>
        <p>This time, he said, Jewish groups are alert to the educational needs. In New York, five schools exclusively for immigrants have sprung up almost overnight. Together, they instruct 800 children.</p>
        <p>The Torah Academy was formed two years ago as a spontaneous effort by Orthodox Jews concerned that standard yeshivas could not handle the influx of Soviet Jews and, in lesser numbers, Iranian Jews. Its goal was to teach children for a year or two until they were prepared to enter the established yeshivas.</p>
        <p>With donations from business executives, the founders rented a dozen classrooms at a languishing Jewish center in Richmond Hill, recruited teachers and now, with a budget of $2 million a year, runs classes for kindergarten through sixth grade.</p>
        <p>Traditions and Grammar</p>
        <p>In the morning, students learn prayers, Torah, Jewish traditions and Hebrew grammar. In the afternoon, they study English subjects required by the state.</p>
        <p>On a recent school day, a teacher, Rivka Bloom, had fifth-grade children separate Hebrew words into masculine and feminine columns. Gitti Willner directed a third grade in succah decorations. Only one child, Ilana Kataev, remembered hearing the word succah before coming to this country.</p>
        <p>''When I was little, my mother told me about a succah,'' Ilana said. ''She said she was Jewish and she told me what is a succah.''</p>
        <p>Children come home and tell parents struggling with the new country what they are learning, and their influence, educators say, carries more weight than it would in a deeply rooted American home.</p>
        <p>''The children pick up the language and they become masters of the household,'' said Rabbi Avrohom Hecht, Torah Academy's director of special projects.</p>
        <p>'This Is Our Life'</p>
        <p>That is why, school officials say, they work hard at avoiding coercion of students and parents. Still, Laura Finkelman, director of outreach, who is from Kiev by way of Israel, says she warns parents: ''This is a yeshiva. The kid is not learning things as a legend or to be erudite. This is our life. Sooner or later, your kid will come home and say, 'Mom, I want to keep kosher.' ''</p>
        <p>Parents have asked the Torah Academy to give them Sabbath candelabra and hot plates for warming food on the Sabbath, when cooking is forbidden. Rabbi Zvi Sourkes, the headmaster, says he complies but also warns parents to move slowly, to wait until simple customs become familiar before trying more rigorous ones like keeping kosher.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is not to put a stamp on them,'' he said. ''It is not to make them Orthodox, Conservative or whatever. It's just to give them a good feeling about their Jewishness.''</p>
