        <p>Turkey has ruled out a rescue plan for the British conglomerate Polly Peck International P.L.C., and a bailout by Turkish banks is unlikely, Government officials and bankers said today. Last Friday, Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's chairman, secured a one-week freeze on the company's debts from 60 creditor banks. His affairs turned sour in August when he said he would bid for all of Polly Peck, whose interests include electronics and fruit, only to withdraw it five days later. The company needs about $200 million to cover its short-term debt.</p>
