        <p>LEAD: TELE-COMMUNICATIONS Inc., the nation's largest operator of cable television systems, has turned to Hal Riney &amp; Partners, San Francisco, for a warmly lit, feel-good campaign intended to improve its standing with the public. The ads will begin later this month on all the company's cable systems and on broadcast stations in 24 states.</p>
        <p>TELE-COMMUNICATIONS Inc., the nation's largest operator of cable television systems, has turned to Hal Riney &amp; Partners, San Francisco, for a warmly lit, feel-good campaign intended to improve its standing with the public. The ads will begin later this month on all the company's cable systems and on broadcast stations in 24 states.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows who their cable operator is, because they write us a check each month,'' Bob Thomson, the company's vice president for government affairs, said yesterday at a news conference introducing the campaign. ''But the customers don't really know us.''</p>
        <p>Hal Riney concurred: ''When they told me we were going to talk to T.C.I., I said 'Who's that?' The fact is, people see brands as people, and we're trying to make this company seem like a friend.''</p>
        <p>The theme for the campaign is, ''We're taking television into the future.'' Tele-Communications said it would cost ''a few million dollars.''</p>
        <p>One advertisement shows a group of old men of the West watching a televised French lesson while a waitress in the town's greasy spoon serves them gourmet food. ''Le mouton,'' the cowboys repeat obediently to the television screen. Then, other images of Fergus County, Mont., roll by and the voice-over says, ''All across the country, cable television is changing the way we live.''</p>
        <p>Thanks to cable, the ads tout, dusty cowtowns have been transformed into a vast land of the hipper-than-thou who like to read Gorbachev and watch German Expressionist films. In one commercial, for instance, old women do their quilting while watching sumo wrestling.</p>
        <p>Other spots stress the importance of cable television as a public service and education tool.</p>
        <p>''Trying to give consumers an image of some sort when people don't know what T.C.I. represents was our main goal,'' said Greg Wilson, a copywriter who worked on the spots.</p>
        <p>''This highlights the first phase of a huge public relations campaign that is not yet fully developed,'' said Mr. Thomson, the Tele-Communications vice president. ''We were quite unsophisticated about advertising techniques, but there is a need now to identify ourselves beyond programming, and we're going to do it.''</p>
        <p>The campaign comes at a time when the cable industry has been under siege from new competition and complaints about lax service and high prices. Congress recently tried to reimpose regulations on the cable industry, which was broadly deregulated in the 1980's. That legislation fell victim to parliamentary maneuvering last month, in part at the hands of Senator Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, the state that is home to Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the nation's seven regional telephone companies have been looking to Congress to allow them to enter the cable business, from which they are currently banned. And satellite broadcasters and ''wireless cable'' companies are also pushing for legislation that would make it easier for them to enter the field.</p>
        <p>In the face of such a barrage, cable companies have apparently become more sensitive. Tele-Communications spent almost $3 million over the last year to improve its customer service after surveys three years ago showed its service was lagging, according to Bob Drake, a researcher at Talmey &amp; Drake, a marketing company in Boulder, Colo. More recent polls suggest the effort was making headway, Mr. Drake said.</p>
