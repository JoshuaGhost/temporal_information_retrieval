        <p>LEAD: The Reader's Digest Association Inc. said yesterday that Kenneth O. Gilmore would step down at the end of the year as editor in chief of Reader's Digest because of poor health.</p>
        <p>The Reader's Digest Association Inc. said yesterday that Kenneth O. Gilmore would step down at the end of the year as editor in chief of Reader's Digest because of poor health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilmore, 59 years old, will be replaced after six years in the top editorial post by Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, 46, the deputy editor in chief.</p>
        <p>The company's announcement said Mr. Gilmore has Parkinson's disease and had decided to step down because ''I cannot carry as full a workload as the editor in chief role requires.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilmore became editor in chief at Reader's Digest in 1984. He joined the magazine in 1957 in the Washington editorial office, and moved to the company's world headquarters in Pleasantville, N.Y., in 1973 as assistant managing editor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tomlinson joined Reader's Digest as a staff writer in the Washington editorial office in 1968, held several positions with the magazine and moved to Pleasantville as senior editor in 1981.</p>
        <p>Reader's Digest is published in 15 languages and 39 editions and claims a readership of 100 million worldwide.</p>
