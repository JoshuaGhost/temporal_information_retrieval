        <p>LEAD: The Senate Banking Committee today approved a $57 billion financing request from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that would continue the savings and loan rescue program through next September.</p>
        <p>The Senate Banking Committee today approved a $57 billion financing request from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that would continue the savings and loan rescue program through next September.</p>
        <p>The action comes a day after the release of a letter Mr. Brady wrote to Congressional leaders warning that the program would ''virtually cease'' unless Congress provided money before adjourning.</p>
        <p>Some $40 billion of the money will be used to cover losses from failed savings and loan institutions. The remaining $17 billion will be used to finance a capital reserve that the Resolution Trust Corporation is required to maintain.</p>
        <p>The measure now goes to the full Senate. The House Banking Committee also met today but put off until further notice a vote on additional financing.</p>
        <p>The money is in addition to the $50 billion authorized under last year's savings industry rescue. It is also on top of about $60 billion in short-term borrowing, which is to be repaid as regulators sell assets inherited from bankrupt institutions.</p>
        <p>The Senate panel also agreed to delete from the proposal a provision that would end the Resolution Funding Corporation's unused borrowing authority.</p>
