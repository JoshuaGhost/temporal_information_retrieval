The 34-year-old right-hander was set loose Thursday when the Padres elected to exercise a $250,000 buyout clause in his contract rather than pick up Show's $1.1 million for 1991.

He finished the season with a 6-8 record and a 5.76 earned run average, having pitched in 39 games, including 12 starts. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
