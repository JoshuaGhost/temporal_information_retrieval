        <p>LEAD: Afghan rebels have opened a two-pronged attack on Kabul, and Government troops are fighting back with air and artillery strikes, officials and diplomats said today.</p>
        <p>Afghan rebels have opened a two-pronged attack on Kabul, and Government troops are fighting back with air and artillery strikes, officials and diplomats said today.</p>
        <p>Guerrillas belonging to the Islamic Party were spearheading the assault on the capital from two directions, a Government statement said, adding that so far 70 rebels have been killed.</p>
        <p>Aircraft were streaking across the Kabul skies, and loud explosions shook buildings, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Rebels in Pakistan said the fighting began Thursday morning and was concentrated 10 to 13 miles southeast of the city between Chahar Wazgai and Sarighar.</p>
        <p>One rebel, quoting radio messages from fighters near Kabul, said they had captured seven government posts on the outer defensive ring around the capital. He said fighting continued today in the same area and between Kabul's western outskirts and the nearby Paghman hills.</p>
        <p>Najibullah Briefs Diplomats</p>
        <p>President Najibullah called in heads of foreign missions in Kabul late Thursday and briefed them on the military situation, diplomats said.</p>
        <p>Officials said he renewed charges that Pakistan had stepped up support for the rebels since Benazir Bhutto was dismissed as Prime Minister in August.</p>
        <p>He also went to great lengths to play down last week's loss to the rebels of Tarin Kot, capital of Oruzgan Province in central Afghanistan, the diplomats said.</p>
        <p>Military experts said this was the first time that the Islamic rebels had wrested control of a provincial town or city from the Government since Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in February 1989.</p>
        <p>Kabul has bitterly criticized Pakistan, which it said had given the rebels a two-month deadline to capture a provincial capital before the Afghan winter sets in or lose its support as a supplier of arms and money.</p>
        <p>The guerrillas supported by the West and Pakistan have fought to oust the Government since Moscow sent troops into Afghanistan 11 years ago.</p>
