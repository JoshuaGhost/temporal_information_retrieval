        <p>LEAD: The Republican nominee for governor, upset that his opponent linked him with a Federal investigation into drug-money laundering, called her a liar to her face today and refused to shake hands.</p>
        <p>The Republican nominee for governor, upset that his opponent linked him with a Federal investigation into drug-money laundering, called her a liar to her face today and refused to shake hands.</p>
        <p>The remarks by the Republican, Clayton Williams, came in a rare joint appearance with Ann Richards, his Democratic opponent in one of the nation's most heated campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams walked to Ms. Richards's side of the stage to greet supporters. When Ms. Richards extended her hand, he declined to shake it, saying, ''I'm here to call you a liar today.'' She replied, ''I'm sorry, Clayton.'' 'You've Lied About Me'</p>
        <p>Speaking of the two Democrats Ms. Richards defeated in the primary, Mr. Williams then added: ''That's what you are. You've lied about me; you've lied about Mark White, and you've lied about Jim Mattox. I'm going to finish this deal today.''</p>
        <p>A Williams campaign spokesman, Bill Kenyon, said the Republican was upset that Ms. Richards was spreading ''unfounded rumors'' by trying to link him with a Federal investigation into money laundering.</p>
        <p>''We think she stepped over the line,'' Mr. Kenyon said. ''It is our intention that Ann Richards is no longer able to spread her venom. We want to make sure she is not able to destroy other people's careers and reputations. We will not sit there and let someone pound us with innuendo.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference Wednesday, Ms. Richards cited a newspaper report that said Federal agents were investigating allegations against a Houston loan broker, Lloyd G. Williams Jr., who has also done business with ClayDesta National, the Midland, Tex., bank owned by the Republican nominee.</p>
        <p>''I think it is incumbent on Clayton Williams to cooperate with the investigation and tell the voters of Texas what his relationship was with Lloyd Williams,'' Ms. Richards said.</p>
        <p>Tower Lashes Out in Omaha</p>
        <p>OMAHA, Oct. 11 (AP) - John G. Tower, the former Texas Senator campaigning for the Republican Senate candidate in Nebraska, said today that the Democratic incumbent, Senator Jim Exon, is reputed to be ''one of the two or three biggest boozers in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>''We were talking about standards a while ago,'' Mr. Tower said on the Omaha radio station KKAR. ''Senator Exon bore down on me heavily on the drinking thing when he's got the reputation in Washington of being one of the two or three biggest boozers in the Senate. So why did he take up the cudgel on that?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Exon, who opposed the doomed nomination of Mr. Tower as Defense Secretary last year, said that the accusations were false and that he would welcome any Senate inquiry into his reputation.</p>
