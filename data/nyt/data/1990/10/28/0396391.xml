        <p>There are few who would argue that one of the most important issues to be faced for our future is the protection and preservation of our natural environment. This is especially pertinent on Long Island, where our economic and individual survival is dependent upon the protection of our underground aquifer, the only source of drinking water for 2.6 million residents in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and on the preservation of our environmentally sensitive lands.</p>
        <p>In my four years in the State Legislature, I have seen and continue to see an ever-increasing awareness of, and commitment to, protecting the health of our environment by the citizens of New York State.</p>

        <p>There are few who would argue that one of the most important issues to be faced for our future is the protection and preservation of our natural environment. This is especially pertinent on Long Island, where our economic and individual survival is dependent upon the protection of our underground aquifer, the only source of drinking water for 2.6 million residents in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, and on the preservation of our environmentally sensitive lands.</p>
        <p>In my four years in the State Legislature, I have seen and continue to see an ever-increasing awareness of, and commitment to, protecting the health of our environment by the citizens of New York State.</p>
        <p>Recognition of the importance of Long Island's environmentally sensitive watershed areas, like the pine barrens in Suffolk and the Oyster Bay and North Hills Special Groundwater Protection Areas in Nassau, has been particularly strong. Accordingly, all levels of government have responded by implementing a variety of measures that attempt to safeguard these most important and necessary natural areas.</p>
        <p>In fact, the preservation of our precious natural resources -- our environment -- is no longer a luxury to be taken for granted, but is now recognized as an individual obligation and a governmental responsibility. Toward this end, programs that bring such lands into public ownership are of great significance.</p>
        <p>In a year in which there could be no agreement on a number of notable issues, the State Legislature overwhelmingly passed, and the Governor signed into law, the 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act. Itwill appear as Proposal One on the statewide ballot Election Day.</p>
        <p>If we are to preserve our irreplaceable natural and historic heritage, create and improve our municipal parks, provide assistance to local municipalities for closing unsafe landfills, safely handle medical waste and domestic sewage and establish regional recycling facilities, each of us must take affirmative action when we enter the voting booth this year.</p>
        <p>For a cost of less than 2 cents a person a day, we will have come one step closer to leaving a living legacy for future generations of New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Vote 'Yes' on Proposal One. THOMAS P. DiNAPOLI</p>
        <p>Assemblyman DiNapoli is co-chairman of the State Legislative Commission on Water Resource Needs of Long Island.</p>
