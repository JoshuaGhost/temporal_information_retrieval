        <p>Clark Gable, John Wayne, Gary Cooper and William Holden are gone. But there is still Sean Connery to remind moviegoers of what real stardom is all about.</p>
        <p>At 60 he's one of the few male actors who seem bigger than life and whose very appearance in a new film seems guaranteed to draw both men and women to the box office. And, best of all, his talent as an actor seems to be growing, with each new outing providing surprises.</p>
        <p>As evidence, there's a convincing portrayal in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER (1990, Paramount, $99.95), adapted from the Tom Clancy best-seller, which finds Mr. Connery the center of often hostile international attention as the defector-captain of the Soviet Union's most advanced nuclear submarine.</p>
        <p>The Scottish-born performer, who made his debut as a piece of beefcake in a London production of "South Pacific" in 1951, jumped to stardom with DR. NO (MGM/UA, $19.95) in 1962, and it is clear now that the combination of dry wit and athleticism that he brought to the role of 007 made him the best of James Bonds. Although there were predictions that the actor had made a fatal career choice in 1971 when he turned his back on the moneymaking Bond role after DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (MGM/UA, $19.95) -- never to return until NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN (Warner, $79.95) -- it is clear now that both Mr. Connery and moviegoers are the richer for his decision.</p>
        <p>A splendid array of captivating performances have followed. To list only a few, there is the aging Robin Hood (opposite Audrey Hepburn) in Richard Lester's geriatric love story ROBIN AND MARIAN (1976, RCA/Columbia, $59.95); the British soldier enthroned as god-king (with the connivance of Michael Caine) in Kipling's India in John Huston's MAN WHO WOULD BE KING (1975, CBS/Fox, $19.98); the incorruptible Chicago cop -- an Academy Award-winning turn -- in Brian De Palma's UNTOUCHABLES (1987, Paramount, $19.95), and, of course, Indiana Jones's salty father, the life of the party, in Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989, Paramount, $24.95).</p>
        <p>The man some people might have kept bottled in Bond turned out to be even better when uncorked.  HOME ENTERTAINMENTS/RECORDINGS CRITICS' CHOICES</p>
