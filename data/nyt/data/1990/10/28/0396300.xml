        <p>THE Bush Administration and leaders in the House and Senate finally cobbled together a budget agreement last week. And if it sticks, it might even have a real -- although small -- shrinking effect on the nation's budget deficit.</p>
        <p>But for the equity investor, the reduction will not be enough, by any stretch, to ease the growing capital supply problem that is coloring the economic outlook for the next year. Nor will the situation be helped even if the Middle East crisis is resolved relatively quickly.</p>
        <p>That is because the United States, which has become the world's largest debtor, will still need billions of dollars in foreign capital to cover its trade and budget deficits. And Eastern Europe will also be screaming for capital to rebuild itself after more than 40 years of Communist rule.</p>
        <p>Yet the world's two main creditors, Japan and Germany, have less to lend, perhaps much less. Japan, the largest exporter of capital, is pulling back as money is brought home to help recapitalize banks and cushion their losses from the Tokyo stock market's decline this year of nearly 50 percent. And Germany has to pay for the rebuilding of the old East Germany.</p>
        <p>This capital imbalance, at least for now, is the reason for the bear market outlook of David C. Roche, the co-director of research for Morgan Stanley &amp; Company in London. It accounts for his predisposition to invest in cash or bonds in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roche is worried that bankruptcies of major companies suddenly may start to pop up, shaking the financial markets. And he concludes that the worsening outlook for growth and inflation in Europe will aggravate the capital problem by enlarging deficits there next year.</p>
        <p>The consequence of meeting this capital demand, he said in an interview last week, is going to be a rise in overall savings. The attraction of high interest rates diverts consumer spending into savings, which in turn slows economic growth. This rise in savings and resulting slowdown was already under way before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Mr. Roche expects consumers to continue saving because rates will remain relatively high for the next few months.</p>
        <p>The question is just how severe the slowdown will be. Mr. Roche expects "recessionary periods," or quarters, next year in which growth will decline in Italy, Scandinavia and possibly in France and Spain. A recession is likely in Britain. Germany is still growing the most but it is not the engine it might have been for the rest of Europe. Because of its central role in the European economy, Germany has exported its high interest rates to its neighbors and that has been enough to offset the growth generated by rising European exports to Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roche has cut his forecast for growth in Europe in 1991 to 1.9 percent, from 2.7 percent. And he predicts earnings per share will drop by 2.6 percent, a dramatic shift from his previous forecast of a 4.5 percent increase.</p>
        <p>But because Mr. Roche believes the economic slowdown in Europe is being caused by rising savings, he also thinks a turnaround can come quickly with a decline in interest rates. He notes that household income in Europe has been rising this year, so consumers are not losing buying power. They are just deciding to save more because of the high rates they can earn.</p>
        <p>This all combines to form an approach to equities that inspires caution but also encourages investors to be ready to pounce.</p>
        <p>So while Mr. Roche still likes cash, he has reduced his cash position to 13 percent, from 19 percent, in order to buy bonds in Europe, especially Germany and France, because he feels interest rates are near their peak.</p>
        <p>And he has a new interest in Japan, where the recent rise in the yen and a small drop in interest rates have sparked a nice rally. "I just feel that the relative strength of Japan to Europe no longer directs such a strong overweight to Europe," he said.</p>
        <p>In Europe, Mr. Roche is staying away from chemicals, automobiles, machine tools, airlines (except for Germany's Lufthansa) and hotels. These will all suffer in the slowdown. He is also staying away from many banks for now, selling Credit Lyonnais in France and Banco Commerciale Italiana, among others. (But he is keeping his banks in Germany.) As for countries, he is avoiding investments in Italy (except for telecommunications), Greece, Turkey, Spain and Sweden; he does not think they will rebound quickly. Italy has deep budget problems, for example, and Sweden is facing an economic overhaul.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roche likes companies that will play a role in the remaking of the old East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe: road builders, telephone companies, office suppliers and utilities, among others.</p>
        <p>This theme has piqued his interest in Germany although he expects a 4 percent overall decline in earnings there next year. He thinks most of this decline will be borne by the chemical, auto and other stocks that he is avoiding. On his "buy" list: Siemens, Hochtief, Mannesmann and Bilfinger &amp; Berger. He also likes CGE and Saint Gobain in France.</p>
        <p>"I can find stocks," he said, "that are doing things that can get done despite the economic cycle."</p>
