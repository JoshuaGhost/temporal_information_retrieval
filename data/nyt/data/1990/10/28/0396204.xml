        <p>THE year was 1938. The Great Depression had taken a turn for the worse, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, through the previous five years, had tried repeatedly to balance the Federal budget, finally gave up the effort. Among other steps, he reversed a cost-cutting order to disband the Public Works Administration. Instead, he pumped $1 billion into the agency -- all borrowed funds -- to pay the salaries of thousands of newly hired workers.</p>
        <p>The story is recounted in "Balanced Budgets and American Politics" by James D. Savage, a political scientist and the author of one of half a dozen books published in the last several years that analyze the present national aversion to deficits. Rarely in American history has the outcry against deficits been as strong as it is today, especially during this fall's messy battle in Washington over deficit reduction. In response, most of the authors of this sampling of books try to calm the citizenry.</p>
        <p>They succeed, chiefly by offering their readers insights and history that don't often show up in daily news coverage. Roosevelt's experience is part of Mr. Savage's argument. Although the 32d President could never bring himself to acknowledge that deficit spending in peacetime was good policy, he accepted the practice in 1938 "as a positive and necessary activity if the economy were to recover," Mr. Savage writes. The strategy worked; the economy expanded in 1939 and kept right on growing. And for the next 40 years deficit spending became a proven and legitimate tool for regulating the economy. Not until the final year of Jimmy Carter's Presidency did the White House abandon, as standard policy, the sort of stimulation of the economy through Government programs proposed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes and first adopted in this country by F. D. R.</p>
        <p>What would move Mr. Carter to abandon one of the New Deal's hallmark economic policies? Inflation frightened him into budget cutting. As big deficits developed, Mr. Carter and others came to blame them for inflation and other problems -- arguing cause and effect relationships that do not hold up well when deficits are examined more closely, as they have been in a number of recent books. That is certainly the case when deficits are placed in a historical context, as Mr. Savage does particularly well, and also Herbert Stein, in his "Governing the $5 Trillion Economy." While Mr. Savage traces various Government budgets back to 1690, Mr. Stein, a leader among the nation's conservative economists and one of his profession's most lucid and succinct writers, covers the pertinent history in a few pages.</p>
        <p>The principal insight to be gathered from these accounts, and many others, is that a deficit should not be a nation's greatest concern; economic growth should be. Mr. Savage gives a five-page table of Government finances going back to 1789. It shows that deficits have been standard operating practice for two generations and the Federal Government has reported surpluses in only seven years since 1930.</p>
        <p>Deficits simply were not considered a problem as long as the economy generated more than enough new wealth to pay for the shortfalls. The deficit might rise by, say, $10 billion from one year to the next. But if national income went up by $15 billion, then Americans could finance the shortfall -- through tax payments or the purchase of Treasury securities -- and still have $5 billion in new wealth left over for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Until early in this century, the White House and Congress did not even think in terms of not having enough funds to pay for Government outlays. Only in 1911 did formal budgeting, as a means of allocating scarce resources, get under way, Mr. Stein notes. "The situation prior to that is something of a mystery," he writes. "The usual description is that, except in wartime, the Federal Government did not live with scarcity." In fact, from the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the 20th century budget surpluses were normal. As the nation spread rapidly westward in that period, the rising output of expanding agriculture, industry and railroads furnished more than enough wealth to pay for whatever services the Federal Government chose to offer.</p>
        <p>Except during the two world wars and the Great Depression, Government spending did not outstrip the capacity of the nation's economic expansion to provide revenues until the early 1970's. The rebirth of other industrial nations and stiff competition from foreign corporations then cut into the American market and into the American share of the global market. And in the 70's and 80's Social Security, Medicare, military outlays, farm subsidies, highway and airport construction, welfare, education and many other Federal outlays that had blossomed after World War II became a burden.</p>
        <p>What the recent books on the deficit reflect is that at that point the deficit became a political issue. Given an economy that no longer expands at its old, rapid rate, today's budget deficits represent a bigger percentage of the national wealth than they have at any time in the 20th century, except for the war and Depression years. That scared Americans into accepting the imposition a few years ago of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, which imposes a general sequestering of a percentage of the budget if Congress and the President cannot agree on certain levels of cuts in the deficit. And the fear of deficits explains why the recent struggle between President Bush and Congress, and among members of Congress, was so painful and disorderly as the two branches of Government tried to cut back services that are deeply entrenched in American society.</p>
        <p>As the political scientists Joseph White and Aaron Wildavsky, authors of "The Deficit and the Public Interest," put it: "The budget has been to our era what civil rights, communism, the depression, industrialization and slavery were at other times. Nor does the day of the budget show signs of ending." Mr. White and Mr. Wildavsky devote most of their 575-page text to an account of the annual budget negotiations since 1974 -- a history that helps to explain why the push for cutbacks has finally become such a crisis issue. Making the choice to reduce the deficit is more difficult than anyone seems to admit, the authors declare.</p>
        <p>BUT while budget deficits might be mostly a political issue, the daily debate highlights economics. Here the new budget literature is particularly useful in sorting fact from fiction. Nearly all the nation's economic ills are blamed these days on the deficit. It is linked to inflation, high interest rates, wasteful spending, lackluster investment, low productivity, the trade deficit and what is often presented as a fatal overdependence on foreign lenders.</p>
        <p>F. D. R. had also associated deficits with inflation, although deflation was the big problem in the 30's. Fear of inflation, in fact, had made him reluctant before 1938 to use deficits to regulate the economy. As the reader will find out from these books, the essence of the view that deficits cause inflation and other dire economic consequences is this: to finance the big deficits the Government has to borrow so much money through the sale of Treasury securities that not enough is left over to invest in expansion of the private sector. Inflation inevitably erupts because without strong new investment the economy can't grow fast enough to supply all that people demand, particularly the demands of a big-spending Government. And with investment funds scarce, interest rates rise to ration loans. The high rates, in turn, discourage many companies from investing in factories, offices and machinery, further inhibiting the creation of new wealth. Foreign lenders, attracted by the high interest rates, then step in, becoming big lenders to the Government. Paying the interest in the future on the debt held by foreigners means a further drain on the national wealth.</p>
        <p>In "Day of Reckoning," Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard University economist, lays out emphatically these doomsday economics of deficit spending. The other economists represented in this group of books mostly seem to disagree. They note, for example, that inflation and interest rates have been both high and low during years of big deficits, and so has investment. The deficit-doomsday links are hard to find in the record, they maintain.</p>
        <p>Robert Ortner, in "Voodoo Deficits," is particularly sarcastic about the alleged dire economic consequences of deficits. Mr. Ortner was the chief economist at the Commerce Department during the Reagan Administration, which made deficit cutting a major goal -- even though it took no substantive action to reduce the deficit. Among other arguments, Mr. Ortner notes that the annual deficit would be much lower if it weren't for the nearly $200 billion a year the Government spends on interest payments to service the $3 trillion accumulated national debt. Such big interest payments mean that less is available for Social Security, the military and other programs. But, Mr. Ortner argues, nearly 85 percent of the national debt is held by Americans, so the interest payments go mostly to them rather than to foreigners. They stay within the national family, so to speak, ameliorating the shortage of funds in the private sector.</p>
        <p>The accumulation of such arguments in most of the new deficit literature helps to explain why the deficits, big as they are, haven't yet produced much noticeable economic damage. Even Mr. Friedman, committed as he is to cutting the deficit, suggests that the American economy can still find ways to finance it, although it is approaching $300 billion in the current fiscal year, roughly 5 percent of the total economy, as measured by the gross national product. Only in the late 1940's, in the aftermath of World War II, and during the recession of the early '80's, has the percentage been that high.</p>
        <p>THE issue, then, is how to reverse the trend and make the deficit shrink as a percentage of the total economy, or least to prevent its rise. Most of these authors devote a chapter to their favorite proposals, and the last chapter of Mr. Friedman's book is eloquent. Among other ideas, he would as a last resort reverse Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, which reduced Federal revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars in the 1980's. If other measures prove politically unacceptable, he writes, "Then the best way to right our fiscal policy -- the way most likely to promote public understanding and thereby command public support -- is to admit that with Kemp-Roth  [ the name of the Reagan tax bill ]  we cut taxes too much, and fix our mistake."</p>
        <p>But raising taxes to reduce the deficit just as the American economy is sinking toward recession runs counter to the old Keynesian thesis that in hard times Government should be encouraging people to spend and invest, not restricting spending through higher taxes or cutbacks in outlays. Keynesian stimulus might be gone from the Administration's box of policy tools, but the principle involved remains very much in people's minds. Most politicians and economists are reluctant to cut Government spending in a weakening economy.</p>
        <p>Robert Eisner's "How Real Is the Federal Deficit?," first published in 1986 and now the granddaddy of the deficit books, stands today as a sort of classic reference work for those who want to restore the Keynesian approach to politics. Mr. Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University, argues that to a large extent, the deficits represent productive investments that increase the national wealth. For him, spending for highways, education, research, airports, even health care, increases the nation's productive capacity, just as the output from a new factory increases a corporation's revenues and profits. A well-educated worker, for instance, can produce more goods of better quality than a poorly educated one, and a wide new highway gets goods to market faster and less expensively than an older, rutted one.</p>
        <p>And just as the corporation uses the earnings from its new factory to repay the bonds floated to build it, the Government draws on the new wealth that flows from the nation's productive investments to finance the deficit. Separate the Government's "capital expenditures" from its outlays for consumption (including most military spending), and the startling deficits of the 80's shrink toward insignificance, Mr. Eisner argues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisner makes his case in somewhat technical language, while the economists Robert L. Heilbroner and Peter Bernstein, in "The Debt and the Deficit," covering the same ground, assume that their reader comes new to the deficit issue and they make it easier to grasp. The liberal Mr. Heilbroner and the conservative Mr. Stein, however much they differ in ideology, seem to agree that deficits are not the greatest dangers to society. The two men are probably the profession's easiest-to-read and most entertaining writers and their deficit books, each less than 140 pages, cover the ground well enough for most readers. What does the Heilbroner-Bernstein book conclude? "In normal times we favor a 'deficit', by which we mean growth-promoting expenditures . . . of 2 to 3 percent of G.N.P. -- perhaps $100 billion to $150 billion at today's values," they write. "And that is all. The lesson is over."  READING ABOUT THE DEBT</p>
