        <p>ELLEN STEWART, THE DIRECTOR and founder of La Mama Experimental Theater Club, climbs the stairs leading to the apartment she keeps on the top floor of the La Mama building on East Fourth Street in the East Village in Manhattan. In jeans, boots and T-shirt, her head crowned with white hair done up in tiny braids, she looks like a queen surveying her realm -- five stories of archives, theaters, offices and apartment in one building, which she owns. Down the block, in a building owned by the City of New York, is a second theater. On the way, she salutes playwrights, cajoles assistants, welcomes actors, obviously proud of her proteges.</p>
        <p>This week she is launching her new season, her 29th, with the premiere of "Elephant Memories," a theater piece by the experimental playwright and choreographer Ping Chong. Later this season she will present Richard Foreman's work "Eddie Goes to Poetry City" and Tadeusz Kantor's plays "Dead Class" and "Today Is My Birthday," along with scores of other offerings. While the furor continues over restrictions on Federal financing, with the Republican Senator Jesse Helms spearheading the movement toward tighter controls on arts grants, it seems to be business as usual at La Mama. Or is it?</p>
        <p>Some other organizations that, like La Mama, take pride in presenting work that pushes the limits of art (and whose welfare largely depends on grants from the National Endowment for the Arts) have marched into the fray. The New York Shakespeare Festival, the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival and the Bella Lewitzsky Dance Company in Los Angeles, among others, have refused financing rather than sign a pledge to comply with the Congressional directive banning the use of Federal money for work that might be deemed obscene or blasphemous. But at La Mama, Ms. Stewart quietly signed the pledge and accepted the check.</p>
        <p>La Mama depends mainly on grants; of its $1 million annual budget (including ticket sales), $226,000 comes from the National Endowment, and Ms. Stewart says she is not about to jeopardize such a major source of financing. "Many people expected me to close La Mama, not sign any papers, but I refused to be a martyr to this cause. I want La Mama to live. And if I have to work within the confines of censorship at this time, I will do it."</p>
        <p>Has la Mama lost her nerve? Is age -- she's past 70 -- making her soft? As she will remind you, Ellen Stewart is herself no stranger to charges of obscenity and pornography. She loves to tell the story of presenting Jean-Claude van Itallie's "America Hurrah" in France in 1965. In the play people dressed as robots destroyed motel rooms and drew pictures of phalluses on the walls -- a statement on pop culture and modern times that is still considered a 60's landmark. The French authorities took away Ms. Stewart's passport and charged her with pornography.  She claims to have been the first to present nudity and four-letter words on stage.  She is proud to have presented Holly Hughes, who is vocal and explicit about her lesbianism, and who was one of the four performance artists recommended for an endowment grant this year but turned down by the endowment's chairman, John E. Frohnmayer.</p>
        <p>But in spite of that record, Ms. Stewart is determined to follow the new National Endowment guidelines and will not produce a play or a show if it violates the spirit of the law. According to her longtime business manager James Moore, no production has been canceled on the basis of the new regulations, but in her inimitable manner, Ms. Stewart has told her artists, "Now, children, you're going to have to clean up your act."</p>
        <p>If this stance comes as a surprise or even a disappointment to anyone who expected Ellen Stewart to climb the barricades, she shrugs it off. She simply doesn't think she can afford any grand gesture. "I am not going to violate the law," she insists. "But I am going to work overtime to find a way to change it." How? "I don't know at this point."</p>
        <p>The law, in fact, may be changing. Congress is currently considering compromise legislation that would do away with the pledge, leaving obscenity judgments to the courts. Artists whose endowment-financed work was found to be obscene would be required to repay the grants.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Ms. Stewart believes that the obscenity debate will blow over, and that the Jesse Helmses come and go. Grant restrictions "might not allow works that are considered censorable to be shown, but it doesn't mean that they're dead," and, she says, it doesn't mean that the avant-garde impulse to push limits and take chances is dead.</p>
        <p>At a time when the viability of the avant-garde in the United States is being questioned, Ms. Stewart remains optimistic. "It's just that there hasn't been a focus on what we've been doing. In the 80's, we had the era of the yuppie, who was only interested in traditional theater, in everything that exemplifies success and comfort."</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart founded Cafe La Mama in 1961. The little basement coffeehouse on the Lower East Side (before it became the East Village) caught on right away as a haven for artistic experimentation. Among the playwrights whose early work was presented on its stage were Harold Pinter, Tom Eyen (author of the Broadway musical "Dreamgirls") Sam Shepard and Lanford Wilson; the actors Harvey Keitel, Jill Clayburgh, Bette Midler and Nick Nolte started out there.</p>
        <p>Harvey Fierstein created "Torch Song Trilogy" at La Mama, and more recently it has presented the work of Mr. Kantor, John Jesurun and a host of others. It has become a prolific theater center, presenting more than 85 new productions a year in its four performance spaces: the First Floor Theater, the Club, the Annex and the Galleria. Ms. Stewart still very much runs the show, and there is no talk of a successor.</p>
        <p>There is also no talk of trying to shock.  For Ellen Stewart, the avant-garde's role is to experiment and create new forms. "Honey, why does avant-garde have to shock? Did Picasso intend to shock? He was an avant-garde painter." In her view, it is the audience's perception that makes art avant-garde or shocking.  "A work becomes experimental to the degree that the audience is uninformed. Should the spectator become better informed, the work he is unfamiliar with becomes no longer experimental."</p>
        <p>The issue, as she sees it, is that much of the American audience is uninformed. "We have two Americas here. New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, a little bit of Chicago, occasionally a glimmer of light in Boston -- you can add Minnesota in there -- these places have a strong appetite for new kinds of theater. And then you have all the other cities in America that have never had an appetite for anything except traditional contemporary theater."</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart is incensed at the suggestion that experimental theater, though still vital in Europe, is losing its audience in America. If an artist like Robert Wilson is getting commissions to stage his work in Europe, she says, it's because "he can't get money here, that's all. It has nothing to do with the audience. An audience will support an artist like Robert Wilson in any one of those cities. You go outside of the cities, maybe he's not going to get 10 persons.</p>
        <p>"And not only is Robert Wilson not going to get 10 persons," she continues, "nobody is going to get 10 persons unless you do 'A Streetcar Named Desire' -- that's the American mentality. It's not that they are not interested; they have a different kind of expectation of what theater is. And the only thing that can change that is to start in kindergarten."</p>
        <p>One of her most cherished ideas is the belief that Americans have something to offer Europe and the rest of the world, that the rest of the world has something to offer America, and that mixing the two will create sparks. She sees herself as a a cook, or maybe a witch -- a good witch -- standing in front of a gigantic pot and feverishly adding spices to see what will come out. "We do not have a tradition of culture in this country," she says. "We do not have that to draw upon, but what is genetic to us is our incredible energy and curiosity and a willingness to try things. On the other hand, the academic person that comes from the other side of the world has many techniques that we don't have here. You mix them up, and you see what you get."</p>
        <p>She points to some differences in the artists' approach: "The sexual extremities that some of the performance artists go to in order to show their work is not something that is current" in Europe, she says. "Nudity is used a great deal in Europe, but that nudity is not necessarily sexual. It's much more part and parcel of a work, one of the textures."</p>
        <p>She still dreams of founding a repertory company, although without much hope that it will ever be possible, financially, for her. In 1985, she was the recipient of a MacArthur "genius" fellowship. She used the $300,000 grant to buy a medieval "ruin" in Italy, where she started a a small artists' colony. But she had to stop renovation when she ran out of money.</p>
        <p>For all of Ms. Stewart's professed optimism, it is clear that her dependence on Government support puts her in a precarious position. So maybe it's understandable, after all, that she is ready to compromise to survive. "Look," she says, "I feel that an artist should have free expression, but at the same time, I don't think that I, as an individual, have the right to impose my ideas upon anyone else. I think in this kind of controversy, there's got to be some give and there's got to be some take, there's got to be a compromise."</p>
        <p>And she compromises with good humor, as she stops to check on a rehearsal of the play "Hello Bob." The stage is occupied by a large, unmade bed, the blankets and sheets tossed to the side. "Don't get me into trouble, now," she jokingly tells the author and director Robert Patrick.  "Don't worry," replies one of the actors, who just walked in. "Everything steamy happens offstage."</p>
