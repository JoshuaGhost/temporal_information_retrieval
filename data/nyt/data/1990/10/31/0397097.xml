        <p>On the fifth day of the strike against The Daily News, Michael Katz, a sportswriter who covers boxing, stood with the men and women picketing behind police barricades yesterday, but his mind kept wandering to the other side of the fence.</p>
        <p>"I think the guild made a mistake," he said of his unit's decision to join eight other striking unions.

        <p>On the fifth day of the strike against The Daily News, Michael Katz, a sportswriter who covers boxing, stood with the men and women picketing behind police barricades yesterday, but his mind kept wandering to the other side of the fence.</p>
        <p>"I think the guild made a mistake," he said of his unit's decision to join eight other striking unions. He followed the Newspaper Guild out of loyalty, he said, but he brought his ambivalence with him. "Do I really believe that management will return to the negotiating table?" he said wearily. "Deep down, I don't."</p>
        <p>Doubts and fears like those were what drew nearly 80 striking reporters to a playground near the paper's mid-Manhattan office yesterday to debate the strike decision and to vent some of the tensions within their 750-member unit. It was their second such soul-searching effort since the strike began on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Though the group decided to stay the course a little longer, other colleagues did not. A few hours earlier, more than a dozen Daily News photographers crossed the picket line and returned to work after hearing that management had brought in several permanent replacements. Ambivalence and Gloom</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz did not speak for all his fellow guild members, most of whom have honored the strike order. But his ambivalence was widely shared, and it reflected a pessimism that has spread to even the pickets. Many of them spoke dolefully of their chances against management's intransigence, and of their chances of finding new jobs in an economically shaky city. Union leaders talk of victory, but most union members spoke of choosing between evils.</p>
        <p>"If I go back, management owns me; if I stay out, I become another unemployment statistic in the city," said Hulric Messam, who began working at The Daily News 16 years ago as a receptionist and is now a librarian. As he stood on the picket line, Mr. Messam said he had little faith in guild leadership and doubted it could obtain concessions from the Chicago-based Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News. He said he thought The News would probably "fold" because of the strike and likened his situation to suicide. "I'm on the chair, with the rope around my neck," he said, "trying to decide whether or not to jump."</p>
        <p>The Newspaper Guild, which also represents employees at The New York Times and The New York Post as well as at newspapers and print shops across the country, is not made up only of reporters and editors; clerical workers, advertising sales people and other white-collar employees are also members. Those who are striking The News, many of whom come from union families, expressed fewer qualms than reporters about the leadership's decision to call a strike, but some shared the reporters' sense of helplessness.  'I Believe in Loyalty'</p>
        <p>"I have very dim thoughts about this," said Aileen Dell, who until she joined the picket line had been a telephone room operator at The News for 17 years. "I was more optimistic in the 1978 strike," she added, referring to a three-month walkout by the guild and other unions. "I do believe the paper can go under this time, but I can't cross the picket line. I believe in loyalty, even if it means the demise of the paper."</p>
        <p>Her gloominess contrasted with the brisk optimism of Richard Brendow, an executive vice president of the guild who has worked at the newspaper for 33 years. "For the last 70 years we've had strikes, and management had always allowed people to come back to work with dignity," Mr. Brendow said as he marched on the picket line. "Past practices should continue. There shouldn't be any difference -- if this is the same New York City."</p>
        <p>Joel Siegel, the paper's transportation reporter, was adamant that times, and labor's clout, had changed. "We've all passed Eastern Airline strikers; they're all still there," he said. "I think we're caught in a larger force. Maybe we could prevail if this was 1970, but it's 1990."</p>
        <p>Joel Benenson, the newspaper's Albany bureau chief, spoke of defending principles without much prospect for reward. "You have to measure victory differently," he said, "and for me, I've decided I don't want to be a party to union-bashing."</p>
        <p>Andrew Kirtzman, a reporter who had covered City Hall, said he felt caught "between a rock and a hard place."</p>
        <p>"If we stay out, it could be the death of The Daily News -- or unemployment," Mr. Kirtzman said. Classic Dilemma</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Jensen, who covered the television industry for The News until the strike, said, "It's the classic definition of a dilemma -- choosing between two options, neither of which really seems right."</p>
        <p>Many of the 80 reporters and writers who had gathered for the meeting, at Robert Moses Park, had hoped that the group would decide to return to work en masse. But what began, as one member put it, as a "soul searching" effort led to a group decision to stay on strike a little longer. "It turned into a unity rally," Stuart Ain, a reporter in the newspaper's Queens bureau, said with a trace of disappointment. "I'd like to go back to work, but I'm not going to go back unless it's with the group."</p>
        <p>The meeting itself underlined certain strains within the guild. Reporters have repeatedly met among themselves to debate the strike decision, but the guild members who are not journalists have had no such meetings, and few have publicly questioned the guild's leadership. Rita Waterman, who has worked in advertising sales for 23 years, was one of the few non-journalist guild members to attend the conference, and she indignantly took the floor, chastizing the others.</p>
        <p>"Reporters think they are an elite within our union, but they are not," she said later. "We're all tormented. I may not have a byline, but I'm still a person." She felt there was only one choice for guild members -- to strike.</p>
        <p>For at least several who did return to work, the decision was painful. Bill Turnbull, a staff photographer who has worked at The News for 24 years, called his desk at 9 A.M. to report for work after receiving a call from a friend warning him that the newspaper had already hired replacement photographers. "If the paper shuts down, I'm out of work," he said. "If I stay out on the street, I'm out of work. This was my least undesirable option."</p>
        <p>Mr. Turnbull said he was relieved at having at last come to a decision, but added that he had one regret. "I wish," he said, "that I could go to bed, wake up, and find out that the past few days were all a terrible joke, a bad dream."</p>
