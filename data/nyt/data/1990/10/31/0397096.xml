        <p>Lawyers for Michael R. Milken filed a brief yesterday with their final arguments in the former financier's pre-sentencing hearing, contending that the evidence had disproved the "Government's portrayal of him as a 'master criminal.' "</p>
        <p>Government prosecutors had been scheduled to file their arguments as well with Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood but were unable to meet the deadline after the court ordered that certain references be deleted. The Government's memorandum is expected to be filed today.</p>
        <p>The defense brief, signed by Arthur L. Liman, Mr. Milken's lead attorney, contains no surprises. Rather, it is a step-by-step summary of Mr. Milken's arguments that he was not involved in any illegal activity in three other transactions that were the focus of the hearing.  The Government's Case</p>
        <p>Mr. Milken, the former head of the high-yield "junk bond" division of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty to six felonies in April. Judge Wood ordered the hearing to determine whether Mr. Milken's crimes were part of a broader criminal conspiracy, as the Government says, or were individual instances of going too far to help a client, as the defense contends.</p>
        <p>The Government chose three transactions to demonstrate that Mr. Milken committed more crimes than those he admitted. The first involved a 1986 manipulation of shares of the Wickes Companies Inc., in what the Government contends was an effort by Mr. Milken to push the stock price up to allow Wickes to redeem an exepensive preferred security.</p>
        <p>While agreeing a manipulation took place, the defense argued in its brief that the Government had no consistent evidence that Mr. Milken was part of it. Witnesses contradicted one another about their roles in the manipulation, a fact that the defense used to challenge the credibility of the evidence. A Conspicuous Absence &gt;HE&gt;</p>
        <p>The defense also argued that the Government's failure to call Ivan F. Boesky, the former arbitrager and a key witness in the Government's investigation of Mr. Milken, "looms especially large."</p>
        <p>The defense brief also contended that the Government failed to prove its case in the second transaction. That involved the 1985 buyout of Storer Communications Inc., in which prosecutors contended that Mr. Milken misappropriated an equity stake from the deal and bribed money managers with it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milken's lawyers said employee partnerships, which included Mr. Milken, received a large portion of the equity after committing to purchase $154 million worth of a risky preferred security. Such an investment in a Drexel deal was not unusual, given the relationship between Mr. Milken and the company, the document said. In 1985, Mr. Milken and his brother, Lowell, lent $27 million to the company, it said.</p>
        <p>Caesar's World Bonds</p>
        <p>Giving money managers of high-yield bond funds the opportunity to invest in a partnership that held the Storer equity was not a bribe to get their institutional funds to invest in the deal, the defense document contended. All the money managers called by the Government testified that they received the offer to invest in the partnership after the funds had already purchased their securities.</p>
        <p>In the last transaction, in which the Government contends Mr. Milken engaged in insider trading in the bonds of Caesars World Inc., the defense argued that Mr. Milken had no inside information at the time he made trades in the bonds. In addition, the document says a trade that was the focus of testimony at the hearing took place days after Mr. Milken left the country for a vacation.</p>
