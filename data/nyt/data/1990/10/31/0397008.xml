        <p>FEW other styles of cooking are more popular today among home and professional cooks than Provencal. In fact, I have been to a good number of restaurants that toss some garlic and tomato into their repertory and call themselves Provencal; the style is much more involved than that.</p>
        <p>For a dish to be Provencal, it should harmoniously combine some of the indigenous herbs of the region -- particularly rosemary, basil, sage, thyme, fennel and oregano -- with other typical ingredients, whether game, fowl, river fish or lamb. Of course, garlic and tomato are essential. Olives are common as well.</p>

        <p>FEW other styles of cooking are more popular today among home and professional cooks than Provencal. In fact, I have been to a good number of restaurants that toss some garlic and tomato into their repertory and call themselves Provencal; the style is much more involved than that.</p>
        <p>For a dish to be Provencal, it should harmoniously combine some of the indigenous herbs of the region -- particularly rosemary, basil, sage, thyme, fennel and oregano -- with other typical ingredients, whether game, fowl, river fish or lamb. Of course, garlic and tomato are essential. Olives are common as well.</p>
        <p>On those counts, the lamb dish below scored high. The chops are cooked quickly in a hot skillet, preferably cast iron, and when they are done a quick sauce is made in the same pan. This is done simply by adding the garlic, onions, vinegar, tomatoes, black and green olives and seasoning. Provencal cooking is more sensory than calculated, so you must taste for seasonings periodically -- and always before serving.</p>
        <p>Serve with a watercress and red onion salad and sauteed zucchini with oil and lemon. A little hot pepper in the zucchini adds another dimension to this dish. Allow about two minutes for cooking. Lamb Chops Provencal 4 lamb chops, about 1/2 pound each, with most of the fat removed  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1tablespoon olive oil  2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried  4 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried  2 tablespoons chopped onion  2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic  1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar  2 cups fresh tomatoes, cored, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes  1 bay leaf  1/4 cup pitted black olives  1/4 cup pitted green olives  4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or parsley.  1. Sprinkle the chops with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, large enough to hold the chops in one layer. Cook until brown on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn and sprinkle with rosemary and thyme. Cook 5 minutes more for rare, longer for medium rare or well done. Remove the chops to a warm platter and keep warm.</p>
        <p>3. Pour off most of the fat from the skillet and add the onion and garlic. Cook and stir until wilted. Add the vinegar, tomatoes, bay leaf, black and green olives, salt and pepper. Cook, stir and simmer for 5 minutes. Add any juices that have accumulated around the lamb chops.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the bay leaf and pour the mixture over the lamb chops and sprinkle with basil.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.  Sauteed Zucchini With Oil and Lemon</p>
        <p>6 small zucchini, about 1 1/4 pounds  2 tablespoons olive oil  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1/8 teaspoon red hot pepper flakes  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Trim off the ends of the zucchini and cut them into 1/8-inch thick slices.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat and add the zucchini, salt and pepper. Cook, shaking and tossing the skillet and stirring the vegetable around until it starts to take color. Add the pepper flakes and lemon juice and cover. Cook for about 2 minutes. Do not overcook. Serve sprinkled with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Watercress and Red Onion Salad  2 bunches watercress</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups thinly sliced red onion</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, minced</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon imported mustard, such as Dijon or Dusseldorf</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Trim off the tough stems of the watercress. Rinse the watercress and shake off excess moisture. Put in a mixing bowl and add the onion.</p>
        <p>2. Blend the vinegar, onion and mustard in a mixing bowl. Stir with a wire whisk, gradually adding the oil. Add salt and pepper and pour over the greens. Toss the greens with the dressing and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
