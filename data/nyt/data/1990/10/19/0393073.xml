        <p>LEAD: New York State yesterday shut down what it said was the worst polluter of New York Harbor, a labyrinthine network of oil- and sludge-hauling companies owned by a single family from New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>New York State yesterday shut down what it said was the worst polluter of New York Harbor, a labyrinthine network of oil- and sludge-hauling companies owned by a single family from New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>The action, announced by Thomas C. Jorling, the state's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, revoked the operating licenses of 19 barges owned by three companies controlled by the Frank family that carry petroleum products and sludge.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that the license of a company handling oil in New York Harbor had been revoked, Mr. Jorling said.</p>
        <p>Criminal Violations, Unpaid Fines</p>
        <p>Over 20 years, the Frank family businesses have continued to work for local governments while compiling an extraordinary record of civil and criminal environmental violations.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Berman Frank, the matriarch of the family and the chief executive of one company, faces a possible prison term after pleading guilty to criminal charges of illegally dumping sewage sludge in New York Harbor in 1987 and 1988.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Frank, who is in her 70's, appeared at a Superior Court hearing in Newark yesterday, where her sentencing was postponed for two weeks. She could receive as much as five years in prison and a $7,500 fine. The company, the General Marine Transport Corportation, has agreed to pay a $1 million fine.</p>
        <p>The 45 companies in the Frank empire owe thousands of dollars in other New Jersey and Federal fines. They owe more than $1 million in New York City and state taxes and private judgments, figures compiled by the Staten Island Borough President's office show.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Jorling pointed to a ''pattern of abuse'' that required employing the state's rarely used power to shut a business.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst performer with respect to the rule of law'' in the harbor, Mr. Jorling said.</p>
        <p>State law allows for halting an activity threatening public health or likely to cause irreparable damage to natural resources. The department is pursuing other investigations of the Frank interests, said David Markell, director of the Enforcement Division.</p>
        <p>The state's action was prompted by an oil spill last month from a Frank-owned barge in the Kill van Kull, which separates New Jersey from Staten Island. The 40,000-gallon spill came from a vessel that almost three years ago lost its Coast Guard certification to carry petroleum products.</p>
        <p>More than a million gallons of petroleum products have spilled this year into the harbor, where water quality has recently been improving.</p>
        <p>Hearing Set for Oct. 30</p>
        <p>The Frank businesses have seven days to empty the barges and move them to a family-owned Staten Island shipyard on the Kill van Kull. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 30, at which time the Frank businesses can contest the department's action.</p>
        <p>Telephone calls to the companies identified by New York State as the barge owners were not returned. The companies are Berman Enterprises of Manhattan and General Marine Transport and Standard Marine Services, both in Bayonne.</p>
        <p>Susan Frank, a family member and company officer, was New York City Commissioner of Ports and Terminals from 1983 to 1985. She came under scrutiny in the press for possible conflict of interest. Ms. Frank said then that she had cut all links to the family businesses.</p>
        <p>Calls to Justin Walder, a lawyer for Evelyn Frank, and Jared Stamell, Susan Frank's husband, a company lawyer, were not returned yesterday. Historically, the companies and their officers have offered little public response to charges against them.</p>
        <p>Groundings, Spills, Collisions</p>
        <p>The Franks' barges account for about 10 percent of the harbor's barge fleet. Mr. Jorling said the suspension would not pose problems for petroleum-carrying operations.</p>
        <p>Eight of the 19 known Frank barges lack Coast Guard inspection certificates, the Department of Environmental Conservation said. Five others have been cited for failure to complete required inspections.</p>
        <p>In the last seven years, the department said, the barges have been involved in 3 groundings, 9 oil spills, 2 collisions and 21 cases in which the Coast Guard assessed penalties for Federal safety violations. The $67,000 in penalties have never been paid.</p>
        <p>In August, the Standard Tank Cleaning Corporation, a Frank company that cleans and removes waste from ship tanks, was found to be discharging insufficiently treated waste water into the Kill van Kull. It was forbidden in court from continuing the practice. $16.7 Million in Contracts Despite their poor environmental record, the Frank companies have continued to obtain government contracts. Between 1983 and 1990, the businesses received about $16.7 million in contracts from New York City, Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, said Wednesday. . Mr. Jorling said revoking the Frank barge licenses from the Frank businesses, which play a big role in sludge hauling, would affect disposal for some sewage authorities in Westchester County and New Jersey, but that alternative arrangements with other private haulers were being discussed.</p>
