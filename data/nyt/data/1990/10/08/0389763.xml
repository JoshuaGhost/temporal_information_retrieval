        <p>LEAD: The governing Socialist Party won the Austrian parliamentary elections today. Its conservative partner, the People's Party, lost sharply but is being invited to continue in the coalition.</p>
        <p>The governing Socialist Party won the Austrian parliamentary elections today. Its conservative partner, the People's Party, lost sharply but is being invited to continue in the coalition.</p>
        <p>The far-right Freedom Party, which ran an aggressive campaign against what it called the inaction and ineffectiveness of the two larger parties, nearly doubled its number of seats in Parliament.</p>
        <p>According to preliminary official results, the Socialists won 43 percent of the vote, or 81 seats, a gain of 1 seat; the People's Party, 32 percent, or 60 seats, a loss of 17 seats; the Freedom Party, 17 percent, or 33 seats, a gain of 15 seats, and the Greens, 4.5 percent, or 9 seats, a gain of 1 seat.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said he would invite the People's Party to form a new coalition. In an interview with Austrian television, the head of the People's Party, Josef Riegler, would not say whether his party would join another coalition with the Socialists, which, as the party with the most votes, will be charged with the formation of a new government by President Kurt Waldheim.</p>
        <p>Turnout of 83 Percent</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow in the party committee, we will carry out a far-reaching discussion, and in reality there are the widest number of possibilities as to how Austria can be governed in the coming years,'' said Mr. Riegler, whose weak showing in television debates with Chancellor Vranitzky may have contributed to his party's loss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vranitzky has said he will not form a coalition with the Freedom Party, which is led by Jorg Haider.</p>
        <p>In an election that was expected to draw little interest, 83.2 percent of eligible voters went to the polls. But the turnout was lower than the 90 percent of four years ago. A poll in the Austrian daily Der Standard last week showed that as many as 23 percent of the voters were undecided late last week.</p>
        <p>The Socialists, who have come under heavy criticism for recent scandals, helped their cause by making the most of Mr. Vranitzky's popularity. Their campaign urged voters to show their support for the Chancellor by writing in his name on the ballot in a ''preferential vote'' arrangement.</p>
        <p>Last month, a former Socialist Chancellor, Fred Sinowatz, and two former Socialist ministers were charged with misuse of office in connection with the illegal sale of arms by the Austrian arms manufacturer Noricum to Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. Austria's Constitution prohibits it from selling weapons to countries involved in a war.</p>
