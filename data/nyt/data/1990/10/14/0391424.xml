        <p>LEAD: An Israeli officer who told his soldiers his conscience would not permit him to serve in the occupied Gaza Strip was jailed for 35 days beginning today.</p>
        <p>An Israeli officer who told his soldiers his conscience would not permit him to serve in the occupied Gaza Strip was jailed for 35 days beginning today.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Nir Kenaan, 22 years old, was the first Israeli career officer jailed for conscientious objection.</p>
        <p>More than 100 reservists have served jail terms for refusal to serve during a 34-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to Yesh Gevul, an organization representing the reservists. Its name means ''There is a limit.''</p>
        <p>Israel took possession of the West Bank area of Jordan and the Gaza Strip after the Middle East War of 1967.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Yesh Gevul said that Lieutenant Kenaan, a deputy company commander of the elite Golani unit, had served several times in the occupied territories prior to his refusal.</p>
        <p>Last week, the spokesman said, the officer called together the soldiers he commanded and told them he felt he could no longer serve in the territories and was prepared to pay the price for his refusal.</p>
