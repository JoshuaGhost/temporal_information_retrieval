        <p>LEAD: Donald J. Trump's new book, ''Surviving at the Top,'' has not survived at the top very long, and some booksellers believe its publisher, Random House, printed far too many copies of the book.</p>
        <p>Donald J. Trump's new book, ''Surviving at the Top,'' has not survived at the top very long, and some booksellers believe its publisher, Random House, printed far too many copies of the book.</p>
        <p>After seven weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, including two weeks as No. 1, the book tumbled off the list disclosed to the publishing industry yesterday. Mr. Trump's first book, ''The Art of the Deal,'' published in 1987, was on the best-seller list for 48 weeks.</p>
        <p>On the strength of the first book's success, Random House published and distributed close to 500,000 copies of the current work, and paid Mr. Trump an advance estimated by several publishers at about $2 million. Peter Osnos, the book's editor, would only say that ''it was certainly a seven-figure advance.''</p>
        <p>But after a brisk start, sales appear to have been disappointing. ''It is bombing heavily,'' said Carla Bayha, the purchaser of business books for Book Inventory Systems, a company that buys books for 23 independent stores. ''If the print run was 500,000, bombing heavily is a fair statement.''</p>
        <p>Harry Hoffman, the chief executive of Waldenbooks, said, ''It's not a bust, it's a moderate to good seller, but it's certainly not like the first book.'' Up to now, Waldenbooks has sold a total of 15,491 copies of the book. Traditionally, Mr. Hoffman added, Waldenbooks sales account for about 20 percent of total sales of a new book.</p>
        <p>Large Number of Returns Seen</p>
        <p>This would suggest that about 77,500 copies of the book have been sold in the two months since its publication and that, barring a sudden surge, a very large number of copies will be returned to Random House and end up on remainder tables. Although it is possible that the Christmas season will revive sales, John Helmas, a purchaser for the B. Dalton chain, said, ''It started fast and has fallen right away.''</p>
        <p>Alberto Vitale, the chief executive of Random House, said: ''It's much to early to say what the final sales will be or what our returns might be. From the financial point of view, it has not been a disaster, I don't think so. And even if it does prove a mistake, that's publishing.''</p>
        <p>Both the Christmas season and forthcoming books by Mr. Trump's wife, Ivana, could revive sales, Mr. Vitale suggested. Mrs. Trump, with whom the real estate developer and casino owner quarreled publicly this year, signed a seven-figure contract this month with Pocket Books for two novels to be written by her and a professional writer. Pocket Books is an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osnos said Mr. Trump's book had clearly made an impact and had gone ''as far as it could.'' He added that the seven-figure advance ''seemed appropriate when the contract was signed in 1988 and Trump's fortunes were going in all the right directions.''</p>
        <p>Trump Says He's Pleased</p>
        <p>Because paperback and foreign-rights sales are still being made, and the book continues to sell, albeit at a much reduced rate, it is difficult to estimate how Random House will fare financially from the book. But generally only hard-back sales of several hundred thousand copies can justify a seven-figure advance.</p>
        <p>Before the book's publication, which came at a time when Mr. Trump was reeling from financial difficulties, many people in publishing questioned whether it would sell even as many copies as it has.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump says he is delighted with the book's sales. ''I think it's been great,'' he said. ''No. 1 for two weeks: I'm very happy about that.'' He said Random House had informed him that it now expected to sell between 200,000 and 250,000 copies of the book, suggesting a return rate of at least 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Besides, Mr. Trump continued, this was ''a transitional book.'' ''The next one will be the real story, describing my comeback and the success of it all,'' he declared, adding that he would write it ''in a couple of years.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether Random House would be interested in publishing the third part of a Trump trilogy, Mr. Osnos paused for some time. Then he said: ''If Donald's career unfolds the way he is determined it will, his next book will make a great story.''</p>
