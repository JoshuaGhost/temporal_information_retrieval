        <p>LEAD: A day after one Wall Street credit-rating agency threatened to lower New York City's bond rating if it did not act aggressively to close budget gaps, another agency said yesterday that the city's recent actions had been responsible for ''increasing the level of concern'' about its credit rating.</p>
        <p>A day after one Wall Street credit-rating agency threatened to lower New York City's bond rating if it did not act aggressively to close budget gaps, another agency said yesterday that the city's recent actions had been responsible for ''increasing the level of concern'' about its credit rating.</p>
        <p>But the agency, Moody's Investors Service, said revenue shortfalls, rising costs, pressures for wage settlements and proposed police hiring should be ''analyzed as separate and distinct issues,'' though it added that ''they do represent competing expenditure pressures on an already tight budget.''</p>
        <p>Moody's said it would look for</p>
        <p>''an appropriate response to address each of these pressures'' when the city issues a scheduled revision of its financial plan next month.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Standard &amp;</p>
        <p>Poor's Corporation put New York City's general-obligation bonds on a ''credit watch,'' citing concerns about the same questions. Moody's does not have a similar warning but issued its advisory instead.</p>
