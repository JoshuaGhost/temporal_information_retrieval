        <p>Fashion took some odd turns in the spring ready-to-wear shows Tuesday night. First Gianfranco Ferre, who doubles as the designer of Christian Dior's couture collection in Paris, showed styles of such surpassing opulence that they reminded old-timers of overdone fancy-dress balls in Venice and Biarritz in the 1950's. Among the astonishing sights were enormous puffs of pink taffeta for skirts with taut black tops.</p>
        <p>Brown leather swimsuits were another arresting series. They were accompanied either by brown leather stoles or matching terrycloth wraps with thick jeweled borders. Swimming, anyone?</p>
        <p>Nudity was a problem, though not in swimsuits. A stretch jump suit with jeweled straps had a decolletage that opened to the waistline; the model kept her arms folded across her bare chest the whole length of the runway. Ball gowns with billowing skirts had tops as sheer as stockings decorated with a few strategically placed jewels. A bikini bottom had no top at all, just a separate collar.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the Fendi ready-to-wear show that followed was sedate, except for the bathing suits. These were inspired by the tops of 18th-century ball gowns, the designer, Karl Lagerfeld, said. They were as intricately seamed as corsets and were worn with either lace-top stockings or dark tights plus a fluffy bit of veiling. Better for a party than a pool, one would assume. Then again, they might start a fashion revolution in swimsuits. Probably not.</p>
        <p>Lagerfeld's play clothes were far more contemporary. They started with white T-shirts with ''Scorpione,'' ''Pesci,'' ''Sagittario'' and other signs of the zodiac inscribed on them. The lettering matched the peach, blue or yellow shorts with which they were shown. It's a cute idea.</p>
        <p>The best casual outfits were big white cotton shirts worn over tiny black skirts with black-and-white striped leggings. The only color was in the Balkan-type peasant embroidery on the round handbags the models carried. The designer is getting the hang of sports clothes.</p>
        <p>Throughout the collection long blouses floated over bicycle shorts as well as leggings.</p>
        <p>Dresses were soft and pretty. Pale silk styles were ornamented with flat tucks. White organdy dresses with low flounces had a charming little-girl look and would be fine for informal weddings.</p>
        <p>Flat shoes had one to four straps climbing up the ankles. The collection, except for the swimsuits, had an appealing, unpretentious look.</p>
        <p>With the exception of his bare-bosom styles, Ferre gives the feeling that more is more. Even when his clothes are simple, the embellishments make them look ornate. Buttons are the size of silver dollars, and beads on tailored navy suits seem as big as golf balls. Taffeta stoles are blanket-size over black patent-leather miniskirts. Bracelets climb up the arms and something - a taffeta sash, sometimes, or a jacket - is often tied around the hips.</p>
        <p>His nicely draped black swimsuits have long panels attached that nervously remind one of Isadora Duncan. Miniskirts are encrusted with thick jewels. Even before the heavily beaded chiffon dresses appeared near the end of the show, one was tempted to cry Basta! Enough! It was an embarrassment of riches.</p>
        <p>In spite of, or perhaps because of, the oil crisis, the Middle East has inspired bare navels, harem pants and even chador-like veils in several collections. In the case of Luciano Soprani, turned-under hems and caftans seem to have emerged from his feeling for loose, relaxed clothes. His tailored jackets are so relaxed they look sloppy, emphasized by the models' messy coiffures with wisps of hair flying over the face.</p>
        <p>The loose look works best in play clothes and some informal evening styles. Chiffon skirts tied on one hip like scarfs are attractively casual. His chiffon chadors cover the head but don't try to hide the face. They can, however, be drawn over the body to veil the midriff-baring bra. They are a bit exotic for fashion's current mood.</p>
