        <p>LEAD: The House failed today to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill cutting imports of textiles, apparel and shoes.</p>
        <p>The House failed today to overturn President Bush's veto of a bill cutting imports of textiles, apparel and shoes.</p>
        <p>The vote was 275 in favor of the override and 152 against, or 10 short of the two-thirds necessary to block the veto.</p>
        <p>The failure to overturn the veto had been expected, signaled by the House's inability to get enough votes for an override when it passed the legislation last month. The vote nevertheless gave Mr. Bush a legislative victory at a time when his leadership has been undermined by confusion over budget policy.</p>
        <p>The Parties Split</p>
        <p>The voting today showed Democrats as well as Republicans divided. Voting with the President were 103 Republicans and 49 Democrats, while 206 Democrats voted against the President, along with 69 Republicans.</p>
        <p>''We have absolutely no chance to get into foreign markets if we unilaterally close our own markets,'' said the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski. The Illinois Democrat is a strong opponent of textile protection.</p>
        <p>But Jamie L. Whitten, a Mississippi Democrat who heads the House Appropriations Committee, argued in support of the override motion. ''We're headed for a real recession in this country,'' he said, ''because we're letting everyone around the world have our domestic market.''</p>
        <p>Whip Sides Against Bush</p>
        <p>The Republican whip, Newt Gingrich, the No. 2 House Republican who led a successful fight last week against a budget agreement backed by the President, again opposed Mr. Bush, voting with the Georgia delegation to overturn the veto.</p>
        <p>The action winds up the textile industry's third attempt in the last five years to get Congress to mandate trade restrictions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the newest effort, cutting growth of textile and apparel imports to 1 percent a year and freezing footwear imports at 1989 levels, would not only increase clothing costs for consumers but also abrogate international agreements, destroying the Uruguay Round of global trade talks for freeing more trade.</p>
        <p>'A Very Bad Bill'</p>
        <p>''Of course, we're pleased that the veto has been sustained,'' said Torie Clarke, an aide to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills. ''It was a very bad bill, very protectionist and very damaging to U.S. efforts to achieve successful conclusion of the round.''</p>
        <p>Joseph P. O'Neill, the president of the National Retail Federation, a trade organization based here, observed that ''American consumers today got the only good economic news they will hear this week.''</p>
        <p>Despite Administration opposition, the House and the Senate had passed the measure in the last few months with large majorities. But the House vote came up short even then of the two-thirds needed to override any veto, which Mr. Bush had promised at the time.</p>
        <p>The broad support reflected the geographical diversity of textile, apparel and shoe manufacturers and a vigorous lobbying campaign by the industry asserting that American jobs are being lost to low-wage foreign suppliers.</p>
        <p>Sam M. Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said during today's debate that the cost of textile protection was comparable to the losses from the savings and loan crisis.</p>
        <p>According to the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the bill would cost consumers $30 billion over five years, with the burden falling most heavily on low- and middle-income Americans, since apparel and shoes make up such a high fraction of their household budget.</p>
        <p>William R. Cline of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, estimates that textile trade restrictions already cost American consumers $20.3 billion a year, or $238 annually for every American household.</p>
        <p>While the legislation might increase the number of textile jobs, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin, said in a letter to lawmakers last month that consumers would end up paying $70,000 for each job created.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have also cited the textile and apparel industries' improving profitability, noting that domestic shipments rose nearly 7 percent in 1989 and exports were up 27 percent.</p>
        <p>With the two earlier defeats of similar legislation, many trade officials and private analysts saw the new initiative as basically aimed at maneuvering for better leverage in the Uruguay Round, the final session of four-year trade talks that will be held in December in Brussels.</p>
        <p>Textiles are one of the keys to a successful round. To get developing countries to commit to better protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property and to open markets for services, like insurance and tourism, the United States and other industrial countries have offered to gradually remove protection for textiles and apparel.</p>
