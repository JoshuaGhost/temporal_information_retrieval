        <p>LEAD: The moon was rising over the oldest part of Baghdad when Saad Aziz arrived at the Maqha teahouse for a game of tawle, an Iraqi board game with links to backgammon. The game is a weekly event for Mr. Aziz and his friends, played after the group of men, Arab Christians, attend evening Mass at a church nearby.</p>
        <p>The moon was rising over the oldest part of Baghdad when Saad Aziz arrived at the Maqha teahouse for a game of tawle, an Iraqi board game with links to backgammon. The game is a weekly event for Mr. Aziz and his friends, played after the group of men, Arab Christians, attend evening Mass at a church nearby.</p>
        <p>Approached at his table on the tiled teahouse terrace, Mr. Aziz, a 33-year-old spice merchant, gestured quickly for space to be made on the straw-mat on the bench beside him. ''Welcome, welcome,'' he said, speaking English and calling for an extra cup of the Maqha's sugary tea.</p>
        <p>Then, to the tap-tap rhythm of dominos hitting the wooden boards at neighboring tables, he set out to discuss the situation in Kuwait, making a plea for the United States to withhold military action until a negotiated settlement can be worked out with President Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's going to be a war,'' he said, switching back and forth between English and his native Arabic, translated by a visitor's Iraqi guide.</p>
        <p>As his companions nodded, Mr. Aziz added: ''I think that peaceful negotiations will be held, and the reason I think so is that a war would be disastrous, not only for Iraq and the United States, but for the whole world. Remember, both sides in the war would possess very destructive weapons.''</p>
        <p>Few Signs of War</p>
        <p>As the Iraqi merchant spoke of the specter of Baghdad's being bombed, the scene around him suggested how little life has changed for many people here since Mr. Hussein's troops stormed into Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Although tens of thousands of soldiers have been rushed as reinforcements to Kuwait, there is little in the Iraqi capital to suggest that Mr. Hussein's Government is preparing for war. There is no curfew, and when soldiers appear at downtown intersections, it is usually only for a few hours, and then they disappear.</p>
        <p>Apart from the heavy defenses around Mr. Hussein's palace, there is no obvious sign of intensified military activity, no tanks rolling down the wide boulevards and no trucks filled with troops.</p>
        <p>So far as a visitor can tell, daily life here remains normal. Along the broad boulevards of the city center, there is a mix of horn-honking traffic jams, the bustle of shopping and the blare of Arab love songs and Western rock music from garishly lit nightclubs.</p>
        <p>Largely unseen are the workings of what is reputedly the Arab world's most ruthless police state, a pervasive network of agents and informers whose reports can lead to sudden disappearances, to long prison terms, even to death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aziz bantered with apparent ease, saying little that seemed likely to arouse the interest of Mr. Hussein's secret police. Only once did the merchant pause, when he was asked if he thought Mr. Hussein would be ousted if war broke out and Iraq lost. Before Mr. Aziz replied, the visitor's guide, a former soldier working part-time at the Information Ministry, interrupted with a flow of Arabic that sounded cautionary.</p>
        <p>''If we lose the war, at that point Saddam Hussein is going to find another job,'' the merchant said, choosing his words in Arabic with evident caution. ''But if they lose the war, are not President Bush and Mrs. Thatcher going to lose their jobs, too?''</p>
        <p>After moving a white checker, he said: ''We don't wish to fight America anyway. But if we do, Iraqis will be fighting at home, and Americans will not. When our soldiers die, they will be heroes. If Americans go home in coffins, who will remember them?''</p>
        <p>Talk of negotiations has been common here for the last week, as though it were obvious that the nations arrayed against Iraq will eventually bargain with Mr. Hussein. But so far, officials who have publicly discussed the matter have stopped short of conceding the only point that seems likely to interest Baghdad's adversaries, an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aziz, too, appeared hesitant on the point, saying that although Mr. Hussein has made a link between Kuwait's annexation and Israel's occupation of lands claimed by Arabs, that did not mean that Iraq would consider giving up Kuwait.</p>
        <p>''But if you want my personal opinion, that will not be easy, because Kuwait is part of Iraq,'' he said. ''It's a territory torn from its mother country by the British, and only restored to us two months ago. Whereas the West Bank is Arab land; even America says so.''</p>
        <p>Voice rising, he continued: ''For 40 years, America has offered the Palestinians nothing, nothing but sympathy for what they lost. Now, two months after Iraq occupied Kuwait, you have sent an army against us. Where is the justice in that?''</p>
        <p>A Message for Bush</p>
        <p>Mr. Aziz, looking at his watch, said that it was time for him to be going home to his wife and three children, but that he had a message before he left for President Bush, about the futility of hoping that the economic embargo declared by the United Nations would bring Iraq to its knees.</p>
        <p>''You tell this to Mr. Bush,'' he said. ''The embargo is how old now, two months? Well, that's eight weeks without food imports, and nobody has died here yet.''</p>
        <p>''Iraq is a country rich in agricultural land,'' he said. ''We have all the area of Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and the Euphrates, and we can grow all the grains there we want. So don't expect that we will collapse because of the embargo, and don't think that we are afraid of a war. We ordinary Iraqis want peace, just like people everywhere else. But if you come with your troops, you will never forget the result.''  THE MIDDLE EAST</p>
