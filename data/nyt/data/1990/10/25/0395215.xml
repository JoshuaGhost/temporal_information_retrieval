        <p>At one point in "More Myth of Modern Dance," Douglas Dunn confided, "In New York you can do anything and someone will come to watch it." What audiences were watching when he said that on Sunday afternoon at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery was a witty commentary on Mr. Dunn's own choreography. Presented by Douglas Dunn and Dancers under the auspices of the church's Danspace Project, "More Myth of Modern Dance" was simultaneously a treatise and a romp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunn could have been a professor delivering a lecture. Tracing his choreographic development, he explained how his interests had changed in recent years. When he started making dances, he said, he was concerned with formal structure and tended to minimize connotation, illusion, allusion and characterization. But these are among the things that now fascinate him.</p>

        <p>At one point in "More Myth of Modern Dance," Douglas Dunn confided, "In New York you can do anything and someone will come to watch it." What audiences were watching when he said that on Sunday afternoon at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery was a witty commentary on Mr. Dunn's own choreography. Presented by Douglas Dunn and Dancers under the auspices of the church's Danspace Project, "More Myth of Modern Dance" was simultaneously a treatise and a romp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunn could have been a professor delivering a lecture. Tracing his choreographic development, he explained how his interests had changed in recent years. When he started making dances, he said, he was concerned with formal structure and tended to minimize connotation, illusion, allusion and characterization. But these are among the things that now fascinate him.</p>
        <p>There was no need to fear that Mr. Dunn would grow pedantic. His dancers prevented that by bursting into motion. When he mentioned that he used to avoid cultural references in his works, the dancers huffed and puffed and raised their arms in a ritual of supplication. Then they slogged their way forward as if engaged in hard labor and chased one another aggressively. These sequences were filled with plenty of cultural references.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunn occasionally broke loose in solo sequences. He put on a woman's wig and capered to a recording of a hearty medieval tune. Later he swooped across the stage to an aria from Puccini's "Turandot." His effusions gently kidded overwrought choreography. But they were also reminders that modern dance was originally considered an art of personal expression. And most of its pioneers were women.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Dunn started to drone away, dancers chanted, "Talking is talking, dancing is dancing." Then they pushed him offstage, only to return with him in wild wigglings and yelpings to pop music. The troupe's women (Jane Townsend, Susan Blankensop and Grazia Della-Terza) jumped and kicked. The men (Bill Young, Michael La Salata and Mr. Dunn) came to life in spurts of hops and shoulder shakes. Mr. Dunn let spectators decide for themselves whether to view these antics as physical exertions, emotional revelations or both.</p>
        <p>By trying out various compositional strategies, Mr. Dunn demonstrated that modern dance can make and break its own rules. Indeed, this capacity for change keeps modern dance modern.</p>
