        <p>Sales of domestic vehicles rose 10.9 percent in mid-October, in sharp contrast with other indicators that point to a softening economy.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said they continued to be puzzled by the relatively strong sales of vehicles since August, particularly when the economy appeared to be slowing down, based on economic indicators like declining disposable income and a sharp drop in housing starts.</p>
        <p>On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 7.2 million, well ahead of the 6.1 million rate recorded in the period last year, and slightly ahead of the 7 million trend for 1990 to date.</p>
        <p>Ten manufacturers sold 183,316 cars between Oct. 11 and 20, up 15.4 percent from 158,863 last year. Auto makers sold 98,633 light trucks, including mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles, a gain of 4.3 percent over last year's sales of 94,543. The figures exclude sales of imported cars and trucks, which are reported at the end of each month.  Slump Did Not Materialize</p>
        <p>When the Persian Gulf crisis caused a run-up in gasoline prices and hastened a decline in consumer confidence, many analysts expected sales of cars and light trucks to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>Instead, demand for new vehicles has remained fairly robust since mid-August. Vehicle sales have been helped by cash rebates and favorable financing, fleet sales and relatively modest price increases on 1991 models. Many people who bought vehicles in 1985 and 1986, when sales were strong, are in the market to replace their cars and light trucks.</p>
        <p>But analysts said none of those factors fully explained the current strength.</p>
        <p>"We don't know what is keeping the market up," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Company in New York. "It goes against every indicator we are looking at."</p>
        <p>Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he believed the soft economy would eventually cause auto sales to turn down. "We've seen a major deterioration in consumer confidence, and job formation has ground to a halt," Mr. Harris said. "But spending does not respond simultaneously to these factors. Historically, when these economic fundamentals go down, the demand for autos weakens. There's no reason that won't happen this time around." Big Three Share Erodes</p>
        <p>The Big Three domestic auto makers continued to lose market share to Japanese auto makers with factories in the United States. The share of the car market claimed by the Big Three in mid-October fell to 84.7 percent from 87.7 percent last year.</p>
        <p>The General Motors Corporation sold 80,571 cars, a gain of 15.1 percent from last year. G.M.'s light-truck sales rose 7.5 percent, to 40,691 units. Among G.M.'s divisions, Oldsmobile and Buick both posted sizable sales gains over last year, an increase that analysts attributed to new models and aggressive customer rebates offered on many 1990 and 1991 model cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company sold 51,357 cars in mid-October, up 9.3 percent from last year. Ford's light-truck sales increased 11.4 percent, to 34,707 units, carried by strong sales of its Explorer four-wheel-drive vehicle and Aerostar van. Ford Cut Rebates</p>
        <p>Ford cut customer cash rebates to an average of $500 a model on Oct 1. Many Ford dealers complained that the move hurt showroom traffic and sales, and Ford subsequently offered dealer cash incentives on many cars and trucks. "There is still a large incentive for dealers to spur their sales by returning cash to customers," said Bill Carroll, a Ford spokesman.</p>
        <p>Aggressive rebates lifted the Chrysler Corporation's car sales 5.6 percent over last year's levels, to 23,581 cars. But Chrysler's light-truck sales plunged 18.7 percent, to 18,631 units.</p>
        <p>Chrysler said sales in its light-truck category were hurt by the changeover to new mini-van models, which caused the supply of Chrysler minivans to dwindle while factories shut down for retooling. Chrysler has also suffered a sharp drop in Jeep sales. Sales of Jeep's flagship Cherokee model are down 21 percent this yer, while sales of Ford's Explorer are 52 percent ahead of the Bronco II, the model that the Explorer replaced.</p>
        <p>The Honda Motor Company sold 12,037 cars made at its factory in Marysville, Ohio, an increase of 44.1 percent over last year. The Toyota Motor Corporation increased sales of cars made in its Georgetown, Ky., plant by 47.3 percent, to 9,213 cars.</p>
