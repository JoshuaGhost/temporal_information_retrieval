        <p>There was a lot of hype and, better yet, a lot of fun, on Wednesday night in Boston when Mikhail Baryshnikov's new little touring group, the White Oak Dance Project, made its public debut.</p>
        <p>The Wang Center was packed with Baryshnikov-hungry fans who had paid up to $500 to see one of the world's greatest ballet dancers tiptoe around the stage in pink pajamas.

        <p>There was a lot of hype and, better yet, a lot of fun, on Wednesday night in Boston when Mikhail Baryshnikov's new little touring group, the White Oak Dance Project, made its public debut.</p>
        <p>The Wang Center was packed with Baryshnikov-hungry fans who had paid up to $500 to see one of the world's greatest ballet dancers tiptoe around the stage in pink pajamas. Those who expect to see the old Baryshnikov will now have to accommodate themselves to the new Baryshnikov, and especially to Mark Morris, who has choreographed all the existing repertory for the troupe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris's own modern-dance troupe has been a regular visitor to Boston, usually under the auspices of the Dance Umbrella, an adventurous local producer of experimental dance that presented this performance as a benefit for itself.</p>
        <p>Having waded past the sellers of White Oak T-shirts (every city on the monthlong national tour is printed on the back) and the huge souvenir book with photos of Mr. Morris, but not of Mr. Baryshnikov, in the nude, the viewer finally came up against an experiment, not a realization.</p>
        <p>There is one huge phenomenal plus. Mr. Baryshnikov has recruited some of the best veterans of American modern dance, namely Kate Johnson, Rob Besserer, Nancy Colahan and Peggy Baker. Jamie Bishton, formerly with Twyla Tharp and now in American Ballet Theater, and two dancers familiar from the Boston Ballet, William Pizzuto and Denise Pons, were also onstage with Mr. Baryshnikov. David Parsons will reportedly join the tour, and Kathleen Moore, of Ballet Theater, is already listed as a member.</p>
        <p>Like a work in progress, the company is a project, and derives its name from the White Oak Plantation in Jacksonville, Fla., where Howard Gilman, an arts patron, made a rehearsal period and studio available.</p>
        <p>On this occasion, there was a guest appearance by Mr. Morris in one of his four pieces. But perhaps, in effect, he danced in two others by proxy. And here is the problematical side of the entire venture.</p>
        <p>Was this really Mr. Baryshnikov's company or a franchise of Mr. Morris's own well-known troupe? Mr. Morris, ineffable and outrageous, camping it up in his camp roles, is one thing. Mr. Baryshnikov, in the same roles, is another. Try as he might, he simply cannot wipe out the ghost of Mark Morris past or present.</p>
        <p>In "Going Away Party," he is not American enough to assume the tackiness that Mr. Morris had assumed as the cowboy-outsider. Despite his string tie and white pointed boots, Mr. Baryshnikov remains a Romantic hero, a different kind of loner that 19th-century Russian literature called the "superfluous man."</p>
        <p>Even when Mr. Morris is not onstage, he is. I did not see the choreographer perform his solo, "Ten Suggestions," but I can visualize him in the dancing while Mr. Baryshnikov performs it. Mr. Morris's allusions to early American modern dance -- a hoop dance or a veil dance, wittily executed with a thin yellow ribbon -- become irrelevant in Mr. Baryshnikov's rendering.</p>
        <p>"Ten Suggestions," danced to Alexander Tcherepnin's "Bagatelles, Opus 5" (played beautifully on the piano by Linda Dowdell) is transformed into something different. Mr. Baryshnikov turns into a childlike scamp, a daydreaming or mischievous barefoot tyke in silk pink pajamas. The hoop and ribbon dances lose their historic references and take on a life of their own. The dancer imbues the hoop section with his lyricism, and his number with a pith helmet turns effectively into another fantasy, as he kicks his legs in an image from "Chorus Line."</p>
        <p>"Going Away Party," which was seen last summer with Mr. Morris's own dancers at the Jacob's Pillow Festival, is a satirical treatment of the 1950's Texas setting of a film like "The Last Picture Show." The songs by Bob Will and His Texas Playboys have irony enough, but Mr. Morris goes them one better. His imagery is hilarious and moving. The world of petticoats and backseat petting is demolished in 30 minutes. Mr. Baryshnikov, keeling over as the odd man out in a square dance, has his own poignancy.</p>
        <p>He is nonetheless better in roles created specifically for his taut formal style. He gamely matches Mr. Morris's flamboyance in "Pas de Poisson," seen recently at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Miss Johnson, still skimming around the floor as she did with Paul Taylor's company, was new as the woman in the trio. The pianists were Miss Dowdell and Mizue Murakami.</p>
        <p>The most substantial work was "Motorcade," a group premiere set to Saint-Saens's "Septet" in which Mr. Baryshnikov has several entrances to a fanfare but otherwise melds into the buoyant ensembles. There is a burst of mellow energy here in a repetition of a little stag leap that contrasts with deliberate aberrations: Mr. Besserer carrying Mr. Baryshnikov like a discarded ship's figurehead, Mr. Baryshnikov pushing arm after arm down a line of dancers as if he were a turnstile freak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baryshnikov would not have made his reputation dancing these kinds of dances, but one has rarely seen him happier onstage. Life begins at 40, or 42 in this case.</p>
