        <p>LEAD: New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that state prosecutors can file criminal charges, including murder and assault, against employers for injuring their employees at work.</p>

        <p>LEAD: New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that state prosecutors can file criminal charges, including murder and assault, against employers for injuring their employees at work.</p>
        <p>New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that state prosecutors can file criminal charges, including murder and assault, against employers for injuring their employees at work.</p>
        <p>In an opinion that occupational law experts said would encourage other prosecutions of employers nationwide, the Court of Appeals rejected arguments by employers that they cannot face such criminal prosecutions. The employers have contended that the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, passed by Congress in 1970, takes precedence over any state criminal law.</p>
        <p>In a string of cases across the country in the last decade, state prosecutors have argued that they should be able to prosecute crimes that occur in the workplace just as they prosecute crimes outside the workplace.</p>
        <p>In one of the best known of such state prosecutions, a Chicago court in 1985 found three executives of a company in Elk Grove Village, Ill., Film Recovery Systems Inc., guilty of murder in the poisoning death of an employee who had been exposed to toxic substances at work.</p>
        <p>The issue has been emotional in business and labor circles because of the possibility that business executives could face jail terms for their decisions about health and safety issues.</p>
        <p>With the ruling released yesterday, New York sided with two other states, Illinois and Michigan, whose highest courts have declared that employers can face criminal prosecution and prison for failing to maintain safe workplaces. But an intermediate state appeals court in Texas ruled the other way in 1988, and legal experts said the United States Supreme Court may eventually have to rule on the issue.</p>
        <p>In the unanimous opinion yesterday, New York's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, said state criminal prosecution of companies and their managers was justified. He said the Federal law on workplace safety did not pre-empt state prosecutions of ''employers whose criminal activity happens to be centered in the workplace or directed against employees.''</p>
        <p>Unless the Supreme Court agrees to review the case that prompted yesterday's ruling, two Brooklyn businessmen who were convicted of assault with a dangerous instrument and lesser crimes will face sentences of up to 15 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn District Attorney and the New York State Attorney General's office charged that the two men, William and Edward Pymm, and their Brooklyn thermometer company, the Pymm Thermometer Corporation, exposed their workers to dangerous levels of mercury even though they had been warned that mercury exposure could result in permanent neurological damage.</p>
        <p>Federal workplace-safety laws do give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration some power to ask the Justice Department to prosecute employers who intentionally or negligently injure their employees. But critics of the safety agency have long said that state prosecutions are necessary because few employers have been charged under Federal laws.</p>
        <p>Convicted by Jury</p>
        <p>In 1988, a House committee found that in the 18 years since the passage of the Federal workplace-safety law, only 14 people had been prosecuted for risking their employees' safety and none had been sentenced to jail.</p>
        <p>In the case decided yesterday, the Pymm brothers were convicted after a month-long jury trial in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1987. Although the Pymm plant was visited several times by Federal safety inspectors in the early 1980's, Judge Wachtler wrote, the inspectors were kept away from a ''clandestine'' mercury reclamation operation in the company's basement.</p>
        <p>There, employees worked ''almost entirely without ventilation'' among boxes loaded with broken thermometers with mercury seeping out of them, the opinion said. One of the employees, Vidal Rodriguez, worked, sometimes without a respirator, feeding broken thermometers into a glass crusher.</p>
        <p>At the 1987 jury trial, experts testified that Mr. Rodriguez was permanently brain-damaged due to long-term exposure to the mercury.</p>
        <p>Throughout the trial, the judge in the case, Justice Thaddeus E. Owens, told the prosecutors that he had doubts about whether they could legally bring such a case. He questioned whether, by passing the Federal safety law, Congress meant to keep state prosecutors out of the workplace.</p>
        <p>Advocates See a Trend</p>
        <p>Immediately after he dismissed the jury, Justice Owens overturned the guilty verdict. ''Under the law,'' he said from the bench, ''this case has no business in here. It's pre-empted by Federal law.''</p>
        <p>But the intermediate appeals court, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, overruled him, and the Pymms then appealed to the Court of Appeals. Neither they nor their lawyers could be reached yesterday.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the state prosecutions said that yesterday's ruling by the Court of Appeals would accelerate what they said was the momentum developing in American law toward harsher treatment of employers who are careless about their employees' health and safety.</p>
        <p>Robert Abrams, the New York Attorney General, said he was gratified that the Court of Appeals upheld the criminal prosecution because the ''damage suffered by this worker is as devastating as any injury inflicted by a knife or gun.''</p>
        <p>The threat of criminal prosecution is an effective method for government to try to assure safe workplaces, said Michael B. Gerrard, a New York lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, an organization of labor unions and health and safety advocates.</p>
        <p>Criticism From Business</p>
        <p>''If a corporate executive is in fear of going to jail,'' Mr. Gerrard said, ''he's much more likely to be careful than if it's merely a civil fine, which could be seen as a cost of doing business.''</p>
        <p>But Richard A. Samp, a lawyer with the Washington Legal Foundation, said employers are disturbed by state prosecutions because they do not know exactly what standard they must meet to avoid prosecution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Samp, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers, said rulings like yesterday's would make business more expensive and could force some businesses to close.</p>
        <p>''The way things stand right now,'' he said, ''employers don't know how safe a workplace is safe enough.''</p>
