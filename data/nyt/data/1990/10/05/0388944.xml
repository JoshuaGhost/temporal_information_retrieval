        <p>LEAD: The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is investigating a complaint that large amounts of hazardous waste from New Jersey have been improperly dumped in landfills in New York and other states.</p>
        <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is investigating a complaint that large amounts of hazardous waste from New Jersey have been improperly dumped in landfills in New York and other states.</p>
        <p>The investigation was prompted by an irate letter from Representative John D. Dingell, who heads the House oversight and investigations subcommittee. Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, contends that the hazardous waste received shipping codes in New Jersey that led landfills to believe the material was regular trash.</p>
        <p>The landfills were unequipped to handle hazardous waste, he said. Mr. Dingell said loopholes in New Jersey's labeling system for hazardous waste may have permitted the improper dumping. The shipments included heavy metals like lead and organic chemicals like benzene, Mr. Dingell said. Specially designed landfills are required for these wastes to keep liquids from contaminating ground water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell complained about the problem in a letter on Sept. 18 to James M. Strock, assistant administrator for enforcement at the Federal agency. Responding to Mr. Dingell in a letter on Tuesday, Mr. Strock said that the issue deserved to be clarified and that a review was under way.</p>
        <p>Immediate Action Demanded</p>
        <p>In a letter dated Sept. 19, Mr. Dingell asked his former colleague on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, to take immediate action to prevent any further improper labeling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's spokeswoman, Emma Byrne, said Mr. Dingell's letter stemmed from only one incident in 1986 when two companies were charged with illegally shipping hazardous waste to a Michigan landfill. The companies were prosecuted and fined $5 million, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection in New Jersey, Judith Yaskin, said in a statement last night.</p>
        <p>Claim of No Notification</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dingell's letters suggested that the practice was not limited to the one case in 1986. ''Equally shocking is the fact that New Jersey officials have not sought to determine the extent of this potentially serious problem nor have they attempted to notify affected states and disposal facilities of potential environmental contamination,'' Mr. Dingell said.  Ms. Yaskin said, in the statement last night, that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection had developed new regulations on hazardous-waste disposal that would be proposed this fall.</p>
        <p>A New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection memo written in February 1988 indicated that improper labeling of waste had regularly occurred and that Department employees themselves had done it while handling toxic site cleanups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell's subcommittee received a copy of the memo from a former department employee, Edward N. Sailer, of Avon, Conn. Mr. Sailer wrote to Mr. Dingell that hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous material had been improperly disposed, and that the practice may be continuing. The memo mentioned two landfills in Niagara County, Secos and Modern.</p>
        <p>''If the activity that Mr. Dingell described is taking place, then it would be criminal and we would prosecute to the fullest,'' said Ben Marvin, a spokesman for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>Besides the Michigan case, landfills in Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Carolina may have also received hazardous waste. Spokesmen for environmental departments in Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Carolina said they were unaware of Mr. Dingell's letters or the problems they discussed.</p>
