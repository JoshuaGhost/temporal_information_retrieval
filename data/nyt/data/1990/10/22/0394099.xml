        <p>Edward Heath, the former British Prime Minister, said today that President Saddam Hussein had agreed to free an unspecified number of Britons held in Iraq.</p>
        <p>After meeting with the Iraqi leader for three hours, Mr. Heath said Mr. Hussein had given no indication that he would withdraw from Kuwait in accordance with United Nations demands but said he wanted to work for a peaceful end to the Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
        <p>"The President assured me that some will be returning to Britain as a result of my visit," Heath said.</p>
        <p>He said arrangements were being made for Britons to fly home on Tuesday, probably through Amman. His staff and Mr. Hussein were discussing lists of names but the Iraqis had sought nothing in return, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heath, Prime Minister from 1970 to 1974, arrived in Baghdad Saturday on a mission to seek freedom for sick or elderly Britons who have been prevented with other Western and Japanese men from leaving Iraq since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Many Held at Strategic Sites</p>
        <p>British diplomats say 53 Britons, about half of them held at strategic sites to deter attack by American-led forces in the gulf, are seriously ill or elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heath, 74 years old, created a storm in Britain last month when he urged world leaders to negotiate with Mr. Hussein to avoid war.</p>
        <p>His trip, which ends Tuesday, has been criticized by some members of the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has contributed to the gulf buildup of troops and has taken one of the toughest lines in the West against Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heath's talks with Mr. Hussein were attended by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tareq Aziz, and were the longest by any Western politician to visit Baghdad during the crisis.</p>
        <p>"He emphasized that he wished to do everything possible through diplomatic means to achieve a peaceful solution to the present crisis," Mr. Heath said of Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>"I don't quite frankly believe that enough is being done on the diplomatic front," Mr. Heath said.  U.S. FIRES WARNING SHOTS</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (AP) -- An American destroyer in the Persian Gulf fired several warning shots today across the bow of an Iraqi vessel that ignored commands to stop, military officials said. They said that after the shots were fired, the destroyer and other American and Italian warships tracked the vessel as it continued to ignore the order and headed for Aden, Yemen.</p>
        <p>A Pentagon spokesman said the American destroyer, the O'Brien, fired several shots across the bow of the ship, Al Bahar al Arabi, after it did not answer its radio and ignored commands to stop.</p>
