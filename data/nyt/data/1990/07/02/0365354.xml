        <p>LEAD: James Pomeroy Hendrick, a lawyer who was an adviser to Eleanor Roosevelt and later became deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury, died yesterday in Conway, Mass. He was 88 years old and lived in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>James Pomeroy Hendrick, a lawyer who was an adviser to Eleanor Roosevelt and later became deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury, died yesterday in Conway, Mass. He was 88 years old and lived in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>His daughter, Alice Hardigg, said Mr. Hendrick died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
        <p>He served in Federal posts for nearly 30 years, beginning in the War Department in 1941. As a civilian assistant to the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, he rose to the rank of colonel. In the State Department from 1946 to 1948, he was a principal adviser to Mrs. Roosevelt, contributing to creation of the United Nations Children's Fund -Unicef - and to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
        <p>In the late 1940's, he was named special foreign aid representative in charge of North Vietnam. He was deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1962 to 1969 after nine years of serving in a number of other Treasury positions. After leaving the Treasury Department, he moved to the Virgin Islands, where he was head of the parole board until retiring in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendrick, who was born in Wainscott, L.I., received a bachelor's and a law degree from Yale and a degree from Corpus Christi College in Cambridge, England.</p>
        <p>In addition to his daughter, Alice, who lives in Conway, he is survived by his two sons, Arthur Hendrick of McLean, Va., and Robert Hendrick of New York City; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>
