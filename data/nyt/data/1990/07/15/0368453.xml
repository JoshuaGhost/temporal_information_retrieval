        <p>LEAD: Having long pursued an independent military policy, the French Government is for the first time facing domestic pressure to reduce its arms spending in response to the changes sweeping the Warsaw Pact and NATO.</p>
        <p>Having long pursued an independent military policy, the French Government is for the first time facing domestic pressure to reduce its arms spending in response to the changes sweeping the Warsaw Pact and NATO.</p>
        <p>The immediate focus is on proposals to cut the 1991 military budget. But the debate is already touching on broader political issues, including France's status as one of Western Europe's strongest military powers and its complex relationship with Germany.</p>
        <p>Reacting to the first signs of public interest in a possible ''peace dividend'' that would trim the Government deficit, the Economy Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, has proposed a cut of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion in the military budget for next year. The budget is about $40 billion.</p>
        <p>After the NATO summit meeting in London early this month sought to reassure Moscow of the alliance's friendly intentions, President Francois Mitterrand sent a message to Bonn noting that ''logic will require'' the withdrawal of 51,000 French troops stationed on German soil.</p>
        <p>Resistance to Defense Cuts</p>
        <p>Yet it is already apparent that even if only minor spending cuts are involved at this stage, any change in military strategy will be strongly resisted by much of France's political and military establishment, including sectors of Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Party.</p>
        <p>Unhappy that the military budget through 1993 was trimmed earlier this year, the Defense Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, now wants a 4 percent increase in military spending next year. And any French troop withdrawal from Germany, he says, will not come before 1994 or 1995.</p>
        <p>In defending a strong military, he has the support of the armed forces, the arms industry and the two main conservative parties. ''If France is a nation that counts in Europe and the world, it is due largely to its defense,'' said Pierre-Andre Wiltzer of the center-right Union for French Democracy.</p>
        <p>Today, the very existence of a debate on the military is a novelty for France. Until now, successive governments enjoyed solid political and public backing for the independent policy established by de Gaulle when he withdrew French troops from NATO's integrated military command in 1966.</p>
        <p>A Counterweight to Bonn</p>
        <p>Over the last quarter-century, France has formally remained a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But no American or other foreign troops are on its soil and it controls its land, air and naval nuclear striking force.</p>
        <p>With Britain, Western Europe's other nuclear power, France has also refused to join the United States and the Soviet Union in nuclear disarmament negotiations. More than Britain, though, it has viewed its military strength as an important political counterweight to West Germany's economic might.</p>
        <p>But now, with the Warsaw Pact in ruins and NATO rethinking its strategic options, an independent military policy that for many years proved politically beneficial to France is suddenly threatening to isolate the country and even irritate relations with its neighbors.</p>
        <p>At the 16-nation NATO summit meeting last week, Mr. Mitterrand was alone is opposing the alliance's new definition of nuclear arms as weapons of ''last resort,'' arguing that they should essentially be seen as deterrents to be used to prevent rather than to win wars.</p>
        <p>Crumbling Domestic Consensus</p>
        <p>And as part of the modernization of its nuclear forces, France is still formally committed to developing its new short-range nuclear missile, which cannot reach the Soviet Union, as well as a new generation of a air-launched nuclear missiles.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, as NATO commits itself to change, France is under increasing Western pressure to move closer to the alliance. There are also clear signs, even in recent public-opinion polls, that the traditional domestic consensus on military issues is beginning to break up.</p>
        <p>''The Socialist Party is urging the Government to spend more on social welfare,'' a Western diplomat said. ''So the obvious place to take from is defense. France can't afford an independent defense policy for much longer. One way of saving money is to cooperate more with others.''</p>
