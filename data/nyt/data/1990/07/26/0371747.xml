        <p>LEAD: Carl Lewis extended one of the most remarkable streaks in track and field history tonight, winning the men's long-jump competition at the Goodwill Games for his 64th consecutive victory in the event.</p>
        <p>Carl Lewis extended one of the most remarkable streaks in track and field history tonight, winning the men's long-jump competition at the Goodwill Games for his 64th consecutive victory in the event.</p>
        <p>While his winning effort, 27 feet 6 inches, was far off his personal best of 28-10 1/4 and Bob Beamon's 22-year-old world record of 29-2 1/2, it still kept intact a streak that began more than nine years ago at an indoor competition in Detroit.</p>
        <p>His last loss was on Feb. 27, 1981, when he finished second to Larry Myricks, who was unable to compete here because a three-month suspension for drug use kept him out of the qualifying meet.</p>
        <p>Mike Powell, the United States national champion, was second with a jump of 27-4 1/2, his first effort, which Lewis, the next jumper, matched immediately. Robert Emmiyan of the Soviet Union, the only other jumper in history to clear 29 feet, held third place with a jump of 27-0.</p>
        <p>''I never really thought about the streak,'' Lewis said. ''I just wanted to jump decent. You always want to go farther, but it was colder than I thought it would be. I really didn't get myself into a groove.''</p>
        <p>Lewis's winning jump was his third, after a foul on his second.</p>
        <p>The evening's program was relatively devoid of tension, but several results were impressive.</p>
        <p>Dave Johnson, the best American in the decathlon since Bruce Jenner, won with 8,403 points. Johnson needed to finish the last of 10 events, the 1,500-meter race, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Dan O'Brien, to win. O'Brien had led after each of the previous eight events. Johnson won in 4:19.95. O'Brien's time was 4:36.63, good for sixth place but still second over all with 8,358.</p>
        <p>Hammou Boutayeb, a 33-year-old Moroccan, won the men's 10,000 meters in 27 minutes, 26.43 seconds, the fastest time ever run in the United States. The previous mark came eight years in Eugene, Ore., where Henry Rono of Kenya ran 27:27.90.</p>
        <p>Natalya Artyomova of the Soviet Union beat a good field in the women's 1,500-meter race, finishing in 4:09.48.</p>
        <p>Randy Barnes, who extended the world record in the shot put to 75 feet-10 1/4 inches two months ago in Los Angeles, won the event with a throw far less impressive, 70-4 1/4.</p>
