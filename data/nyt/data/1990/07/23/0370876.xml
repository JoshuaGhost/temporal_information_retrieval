        <p>The son of the former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks was shot to death as he was driving home early this morning after visiting his girlfriend, the police said.</p>
        <p>Leon Calvin, 19 years old, a light heavyweight boxer who had turned pro in June, was found dead at 5:30 A.M. today in his girlfriend's car on a bridge between East St. Louis and St. Louis, said Illinois State Police Sgt. Ken Willtrout. Reports conflicted on whether Calvin was accompanied by other people in the car, but the fatal shots apparently came from outside the vehicle, Willtrout said. Few other details of the shooting were available. No motive had been established and no arrests had been made.</p>
        <p>Calvin, the oldest of Spinks's three children, had a 2-0 record as a professional with one knockout.</p>
