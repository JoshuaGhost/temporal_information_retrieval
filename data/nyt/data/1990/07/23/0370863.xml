        <p>Zambia, which has one of Africa's largest debt burdens, was granted relief on $2.4 billion of its debt last week at a meeting of its creditors in Paris, Finance Minister Gibson Chigaga said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chigaga said $1.9 billion of the reduction was in past-due debt owed to the Paris Club of creditor nations. The remainder is interest due on debts until the end of 1991, he said.</p>
        <p>He said Zambia's remaining debt, which he estimated at $7 billion, was owed mainly to Eastern European countries. He said they would be asked for similar terms of debt reduction.</p>
        <p>At a meeting in Paris last week sponsored by the World Bank, 11 countries and five multilateral agencies raised aid to Zambia this year to $500 million, an increase of $50 milliion.</p>
