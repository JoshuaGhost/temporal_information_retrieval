        <p>LEAD: To the Editor: Like another reader who was disappointed in one of the summer music festivals (Letters on Travel, May 6), I want to describe my experience with Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash two years ago.</p>
        <p>To the Editor: Like another reader who was disappointed in one of the summer music festivals (Letters on Travel, May 6), I want to describe my experience with Jamaica's Reggae Sunsplash two years ago.</p>
        <p>Three friends and I purchased tickets for the festival in the United States for $50 each. (Individual event tickets are about $6 to $10.) When we arrived at the stadium about an hour before the first night's concert, it was virtually impossible to get to the gates. All of Montego Bay (and possibly all of Jamaica!) turns out for these concerts, with or without tickets, because the stadium is open air and the music can be heard outside. The crowd was so big that making our way to the gates took over an hour. Within 50 yards of the entrance, guards were posted with dogs on chains; they released just enough chain so that the dogs lunged at anyone attempting to get close enough to enter. In the meantime, the crowd surged forward when the dogs retreated and backward when they were released.</p>
        <p>In the crush of people, pickpocket attempts were constant. We did not return for the second or third days but were unable to get a refund. Several months and several attempts later, the organizers offered complimentary tickets to the next year's Sunsplash.</p>
        <p>Reggae is wonderful music, and there are few more enchanting islands than Jamaica. But before readers buy tickets and travel thousands of miles to get to the concerts, they ought to know that the music can be enjoyed more, and in greater safety, sitting on the fields outside the stadium.</p>
