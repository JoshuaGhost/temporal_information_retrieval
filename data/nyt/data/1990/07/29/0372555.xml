        <p>LEAD: Gov. Buddy Roemer gave the Louisiana Legislature's abortion bill a more careful review than it deserved. He found it wanting, devoid of minimum humane consideration for women.

        <p>Gov. Buddy Roemer gave the Louisiana Legislature's abortion bill a more careful review than it deserved. He found it wanting, devoid of minimum humane consideration for women. He deserves respect for his courage in vetoing the bill in the intimidating climate created by anti-abortion politicians.</p>
        <p>The Governor had only asked the Legislature to exempt victims of rape and incest from a law criminalizing abortion. At first, it refused outright, prompting a veto. Unable to override, the lawmakers lunged for a flag-burning bill and grafted on an abortion section. This version did deal with rape and incest, but meanly, with unrealistic reporting requirements, and cynically, with technical traps for women and their doctors.</p>
        <p>Louisiana's right-to-life forces want their state to send up an early test of the Supreme Court's willingness to overrule Roe v. Wade, the fundamental abortion decision. Governor Roemer prudently exercised his own judgment. He found the bill probably unconstitutional under state law and woefully so under the U.S. Constitution. He has saved his state further embarrassment, including the scorn of judges who would be appalled by this ugly bill.</p>
