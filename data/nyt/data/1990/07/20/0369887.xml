        <p>LEAD: A ruling by a Federal judge on Monday has opened the way for a trial to determine the ownership of a hoard of ancient artworks acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1966.</p>
        <p>A ruling by a Federal judge on Monday has opened the way for a trial to determine the ownership of a hoard of ancient artworks acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1966.</p>
        <p>In a five-page decision, Judge Vincent L. Broderick of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied a motion by lawyers for the museum to dismiss a suit filed by Turkey, which seeks to recover more than 200 artworks known as the Lydian Hoard.</p>
        <p>The contested items include gold and silver jewelry, vases and utensils dating from the fifth or early sixth century B.C., known as the archaic period of Greek art. One of the best-known pieces, which was exhibited at the museum in its ''Masterpieces of 50 Centuries'' show in 1970, is a silver pitcher with a handle formed by the body of a boy holding the tails of two lions.</p>
        <p>Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees of the museum, said: ''We will have no comment until we have had an opportunity to look at the decision.''</p>
        <p>Paths of Acquisition Disputed</p>
        <p>Ownership of the Lydian Hoard has been in dispute since 1970, when Orhan Oguz, the Turkish Minister of Education, charged that some Lydian artworks in the Metropolitan, together with others held by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, had been illegally excavated and exported.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan argued at the time that it legitimately and innocently acquired the works through a series of gifts and purchases, principally from two dealers, John J. Klejman of New York and George Zacos of Switzerland.</p>
        <p>In 1977, lawyers for the Turkish Government filed a suit in which they contended that the antiquities were illegally excavated from burial mounds in the Ushak region of Turkey in 1966 and were exported to the United States in violation of Turkish law. The Turkish Government also asserted in the suit that it owns all artifacts found in Turkey.</p>
        <p>The museum immediately sought to have the suit dismissed on grounds that Turkey had unreasonably delayed making its demand and that the museum's case would be unfairly weakened by the absence of witnesses and the loss of documents.</p>
        <p>Briefs were submitted and oral arguments were heard in January 1989.</p>
        <p>A Question of Good Faith</p>
        <p>In his decision, Judge Broderick said he denied the museum's motion for dismissal because ''there are genuine issues of material fact'' as to whether the museum has been harmed by the alleged delay, and as to whether the museum ''purchased the artifacts in good faith.''</p>
        <p>Harry I. Rand, a lawyer for the Government of Turkey, said, ''We are pleased that we can now proceed to the development of the facts and ultimate trial of the case.''</p>
        <p>Ely Maurer, assistant legal adviser for cultural property at the United States State Department, said, ''It is a favorable decision, which is to the benefit of victimized countries in pursuing their stolen objects.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research, a private foundation that maintains records on stolen artworks, said: ''At least one meaning of this decision is that museums and other purchasers will have to be exceedingly careful in the future to establish themselves as good-faith purchasers. I think that's all to the good.''</p>
