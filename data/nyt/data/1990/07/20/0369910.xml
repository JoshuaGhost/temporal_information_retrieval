        <p>LEAD: Joan Lawlor Reilly remembers taking the 125th Street Ferry across the Hudson River to this sliver of a waterfront town where her parents rented a shack and some sweet shade from a Dutchman named Goethius.</p>
        <p>Joan Lawlor Reilly remembers taking the 125th Street Ferry across the Hudson River to this sliver of a waterfront town where her parents rented a shack and some sweet shade from a Dutchman named Goethius.</p>
        <p>That was more than 50 years ago, and Ms. Lawlor Reilly, now 62, still lives here, although with additions and improvements over the years the shack is now a small house. But the land, incorporated in 1948 as a cooperative known as the Edgewater Colony, has gone through major changes.</p>
        <p>There are still no sidewalks, no sewers and hardly any fences. All the land is owned by the 116 shareholders of the colony. But instead of the carefree rustic retreat it once was, the colony is contentious and divided. At the heart of the matter is a question any New York City co-op owner would recognize. Is the colony an investment or a home?</p>
        <p>The conflict started with a rumor that someone wanted to buy the colony.</p>
        <p>''That's the whole thing that makes it so crazy,'' said Lucien A. Fontaine, the harness driver and a resident since 1984. ''There's no offer. But perhaps it's for the best, because the community is going to be stronger for it.''</p>
        <p>Tucked into a jagged hillside in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge between River Road and the Hudson, the colony is one of the most unusual communities in the state. The entire 26 acres is owned cooperatively, and all but 30 shareholders live here.</p>
        <p>Shareholders pay monthly maintenance fees for the land and equal portions of the property tax on the land. They own their houses and pay separately assessed property taxes on them.</p>
        <p>The three roads in the community meander under tall densely canopied trees, sometimes turning back on themselves or leaving just barely enough room for an automobile to pass.</p>
        <p>The homes make up an eccentric group. The tents that Ms. Lawlor Reilly remembers are gone, replaced by tar-paper shacks, expanded bungalows and California contemporaries costing more than $400,000 perched on rocky ledges with sweeping views of the river and Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, when development swept much of the Hudson waterfront from the bridge to Jersey City, expensive houses were built in the colony, and many existing houses were modernized and expanded.</p>
        <p>Over the last year a rumor, of which there are several versions, about an offer to buy the colony for $30 million or $58 million set residents chattering. There were also controversies brewing over how some people were spending too much or too little on their houses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fontaine and a group of shareholders, many relative newcomers, hired lawyers from big firms and spent more than $150,000 seeking a way to block a sale of the land to a developer.</p>
        <p>Another group, which included many old-timers and elderly residents, insisted they had the right to sell, take the proceeds and move.</p>
        <p>Older residents tended to favor a sale because they stood for the most part to make out very well. Because of the co-op status, the money would have been divided among the 116 shareholders. Those with big houses on the river would have received less than their houses were worth on the market, and those who owned shacks would have received substantially more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fontaine said he became involved because shareholders who did not live here were being allowed to vote in elections for the co-op board and would presumably be allowed to vote on a sales proposal, which he felt made it more likely that the land would change hands.</p>
        <p>In May, Judge Arthur L. Lesemann of Superior Court ruled that nonresident stockholders could not be denied the right to vote. He did say that in the future the board could limit nonresidents' rights to own stock.</p>
        <p>Split in Elections</p>
        <p>Some tensions lingered. After decades of complacency, some residents were reluctant to say hello if they passed one another on the street. Unsigned letters of criticism were dropped in mailboxes.</p>
        <p>A month after the ruling, an election was held to fill five of the 10 seats on the board. Both sides put up full slates and campaigned fiercely. Three candidates favoring a sale and two who opposed a sale had the highest vote totals and won. Over all the votes were split almost evenly between the two slates.</p>
        <p>Some residents saw that balanced turnout as representative of the community's true feelings about a sale. Under the bylaws, a sale would have to be approved by two-thirds of the shareholders.</p>
        <p>''I feel the people have spoken,'' said Jack Ennis, a resident for more than 20 years and one of the 10 who joined Mr. Fontaine. ''They want the colony to stay as a single community.''</p>
        <p>Letter From Broker</p>
        <p>''Now that the litigation is over,'' Ms. Lawlor Reilly said, ''we're hoping sincerely that everybody gets back together so we can be the community we once were.''</p>
        <p>But there is evidence that might not be possible. Recently a shareholder who was not involved in the election, Michael J. Ignatieff, wrote an open letter to residents saying he was not for or against a sale, despite rumors that he had once tried to interest developers in the land. He is a real-estate broker.</p>
        <p>''What I said was that if an offer should be presented, we should run it past an accountant, and if it holds water then it ought to be put to the shareholders for a vote,'' Mr. Ignatieff said. ''I told them, 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.' ''</p>
        <p>Nothing that has occurred in the last few months would prevent a sale, but some residents said they believed that with the economy slowing, it was unlikely anyone would make a serious offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ennis said he did not think that the legal battle proved that the colony's days were numbered or that the co-op form was no longer workable. ''Look, having 116 shareholders is like being in 116 marriages,'' he said. ''You've got to settle things yourself.''</p>
