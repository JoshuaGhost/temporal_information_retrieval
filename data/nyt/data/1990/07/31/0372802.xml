        <p>LEAD: Joseph A. Fernandez is running up against the jagged realities of the New York City school system.</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Fernandez is running up against the jagged realities of the New York City school system.</p>
        <p>For six months as chancellor, he enjoyed a string of triumphs as he maneuvered to gain control of a system that divides power between his office and the 32 local districts. Tall and burly, he seemed invincible: the brash, single-minded Harlem-raised kid punching his way through a comparatively anemic educational establishment.</p>
        <p>But in the last month, Mr. Fernandez has suffered a few knockdowns.</p>
        <p>Ten school boards have stalled his effort to gain a veto over selections of superintendents. Some superintendents and principals have chafed at his idea of sharing power with teachers and parents, even though 127 schools have enlisted in the plan for next year. One advocacy group, the Public Education Association, gave him a B ''report card'' that faulted him for ''failure to state an overall educational vision.''</p>
        <p>'Inevitable' End of a Streak</p>
        <p>Last week another reality intruded. The man who once spoke of spending more than $215 million for bigger and better programs was forced by the city's threadbare finances to announce that schools would have to cut $62.3 million, a figure that could shrink the teaching force.</p>
        <p>Some opposition ''was inevitable,'' said Robert F. Wagner Jr., the former Board of Education president.</p>
        <p>''It reflects the fact that Fernandez is an agent of reform and whenever the issues become specific, you run up against entrenched interest groups of one kind or another. It's not that the honeymoon is over, because there's broad support for Joe.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Fernandez's experience suggests is the difficulty of bringing about change when so many groups battle to protect their corners of the landscape, even if they know that landscape is withering.</p>
        <p>Principals are jealous of their authority. School boards and superintendents want to hire principals without interference. Parents want a stronger voice. Politicians want to keep their power bases, and sometimes patronage, intact. Advocacy groups want respect. Even some teachers - and the United Federation of Teachers has been Mr. Fernandez's strongest ally - distrust change.</p>
        <p>It would have been difficult for anyone to rally these disparate constituencies. Yet, the paradox, as one superintendent put it, is that ''part of being highly successful is working with all these groups.''</p>
        <p>''If you act first and consult later, that is going to catch up with you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The opposition may or may not be growing, but it certainly has become manifest and its prominence has been sharpened by Mr. Fernandez's heady string of initial successes. ''I think to judge the Chancellor on that incredible start and to say that the start should continue over a long period would be unrealistic,'' said Frank J. Macchiarola, Chancellor from 1978 to 1983.</p>
        <p>Bristling at Idea of Opposition</p>
        <p>In his first months, Mr. Fernandez dismissed five principals and two superintendents and superseded school boards four times, overshadowing his predecessors. He forced the Council of Supervisors and Administrators to agree to transfers of ineffective principals. After years of official futility, he got the State Legislature to abolish the Board of Examiners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez knew, of course, that these initiatives would provoke reaction, and has called the more recalcitrant forces ''defenders of the status quo and petty special interests.'' But he bristles at suggestions that an opposition may be coalescing.</p>
        <p>''I don't see it any different than the day I got to New York,'' he said last week.</p>
        <p>Many of his allies, including Dr. Gwendolyn C. Baker, the new Board of Education president, and Sandra Feldman, the teachers' union president, argue that temporary setbacks should not be seen as serious defeats. Ms. Feldman said the ruling on superintendents, for example, will strengthen Mr. Fernandez's case for a law empowering him to veto unqualified candidates. A New Combativeness?  Charles I. Schonhaut, dean of Long Island University's education school, said that the 13 school districts that have abstained from Mr. Fernandez's plan for power-sharing in the schools may not be hostile, but merely adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Overall, he said, the people who matter most -state legislators, editorial writers and, most of all, the teachers' union - fervently support Mr. Fernandez.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he's lost momentum,'' Mr. Schonhaut said. ''I don't see any opposition jelling.''</p>
        <p>But other observers sense a new combativeness by groups that gave Mr. Fernandez his honeymoon but want to alert him that, as one former school official put it, ''our role is not to roll over for the Chancellor.'' Jerald Posman, a former deputy chancellor for finance and an instructor on the politics of education at Teachers College of Columbia University, said the superintendents ruling was ''a signal'' to school boards that they have ''a degree of independence that they're not sure they really have.''</p>
        <p>''What people begin to do is really feel their oats,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Strong, If Not Adoring Support</p>
        <p>Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel and a supporter of Mr. Fernandez, said she believes he ''came into town like gangbusters'' to make strides ''before the forces of reaction took over.'' But, she suggests, perhaps he alienated some people whom with a little finesse he could have won over. Other advocacy group leaders say Mr. Fernandez can be ''authoritarian,'' ''patronizing'' and prickly with those who disagree.</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Fernandez's problem, says Joseph J. Kovaly, executive vice president of the principals' union, is that he has been too cozy with the teachers' union. He urged Mr. Fernandez to demand accountability of ineffective teachers, just as he has of principals.</p>
        <p>Support for Mr. Fernandez is clearly strong, if not adoring. But there is a danger that small setbacks could become important merely because of perception; wavering legislators might feel emboldened to reject his programs and more administrators might turn resistant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Connell said, ''maybe this is a time for corrective action on the part of the Chancellor's team to broaden his base of support.'' Mr. Fernandez has shown he can be conciliatory, amending his plan for screening candidates for principal by giving parents a majority voice.</p>
        <p>Too concilatory an approach, however, risks diluting his initiatives. Parent panels, for example, have produced wonderful principals but terrible ones as well. On the other hand, if Mr. Fernandez goes down too solitary a road, he risks losing needed support. The test will come over the more difficult months ahead as specific proposals -the transfer of principals, for example - begin to pinch those involved.</p>
        <p>''The business community, the university community want to see movement along the lines Fernandez has suggested,'' said Mr. Wagner. ''And I think the question will be whether that general support can be sustained against the narrower, closer-to-home concerns that a lot of these groups have.''</p>
