        <p>LEAD: Mutual fund investors seem to have generally shrugged off last Monday's sharp break in the stock market, and cash continues to be drawn into stock funds, mutual fund executives said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mutual fund investors seem to have generally shrugged off last Monday's sharp break in the stock market, and cash continues to be drawn into stock funds, mutual fund executives said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But in what may be an indication of more nervousness about the American stock market, much of the money is pouring into international and global funds, which invest some or all of their money overseas.</p>
        <p>Over all, fund executives said, July saw cash flow into stock funds, but not at the rate of previous months. ''Sales are continuing steady, but they are off what they were in the first five months,'' said Hank Schmelzer, an executive at The New England, which sells funds through brokers and insurance agents. ''July was a little slower than June, and June was down substantially from May.''</p>
        <p>In June, the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported yesterday, the total cash flow into stock funds came to $1.7 billion, down from $4.4 billion in May. Those figures include sales and redemptions, as well as transfers between different funds in the same group, but they do not include reinvested dividends.</p>
        <p>While some fund managers said it was too soon to assess the effects of last Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 100 points in early trading, only to stabilize and close 56.44 points down, others said the effect was small. ''It appears that investors did not take much notice,'' said Steven Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, which sells fund shares directly to the public. For all of last week, he said, more cash was put into equity funds than was taken out.</p>
        <p>At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the effect of the fall was noted, but not for long. ''We had a very big redemption day, three or four times normal,'' said Robert Leo, the firm's director of mutual funds. ''But after that, sales returned to normal. It was a one-day aberration, and then we got back into a positive cash flow.''</p>
        <p>At Fidelity Investments, Michael Hines, a vice president, said there was some cash outflow after the fall, but that by the end of the week there were also signs of ''bargain hunting,'' as investors hoped to buy stock funds before they went back up.</p>
        <p>Fund investors were severely shaken by the 1987 stock market crash, as cash poured out of the funds for more than a year afterward, even as the stock market recovered. But last October's mini-crash was quickly followed by buying from investors convinced that such falls created buying opportunities, and such buying may be happening now.</p>
        <p>Among stock funds, international funds have been the strongest in the last month, some managers said, in part reflecting the fact that many foreign markets did better than the American one in July. Mr. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price said that 57 percent of that company's equity fund sales came from its international funds in July, up from 40 percent for the entire first half of the year.</p>
        <p>In June, the Investment Company Institute said, international stock funds had a net cash inflow of $675 million, up from $622 million in May.</p>
        <p>Global funds, which invest in all markets, American as well as foreign, brought in an additional $79 million in June, down from $114 million in May. Mr. Hines said a new Fidelity global fund, the Worldwide Fund, has been ''phenomenally popular'' since it was introduced at the end of May.</p>
        <p>Several managers said sales of municipal bond funds had picked up in the last month, as talk of a tax increase rose in Washington. But in June, net cash flows into muni funds slowed to $992 million, from $1.8 billion in May.</p>
        <p>United States Treasury bond funds were reported by a couple of managers to be seeing a pickup in interest, too, perhaps reflecting the fact that long-term rates are now substantially higher than short-term ones. ''There is no question we have seen a pickup in our Government securities fund,'' said Ron Lynch, a managing partner at Lord Abbett &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>If so, that pickup would represent a substantial turnaround. In June, the net cash flow out of Government funds was $719 million, a bit more than in May. Not since February 1988 has there been a net inflow into those funds.</p>
        <p>''Junk bond'' mutual funds, which had been dumped for much of the year, seem to have returned to investor favor as prices of many junk bonds have started to recover. Several fund managers said junk bond funds were now bringing in the most cash so far this year. The June figures showed a net cash inflow of $171 million, up from $57 million in May. During the previous 10 months, $6.3 billion was taken out of such funds.</p>
        <p>The professionals who manage stock funds had grown very cautious earlier this year, and they built up cash reserves by not investing the money that was being poured in by investors. At the end of April, managers had 12.5 percent of stock fund assets in short-term money- market instruments, called ''cash'' in the industry. That fell to 11.3 percent by the end of May, and to 10.9 percent at the end of June.</p>
        <p>The managers of aggressive-growth funds, which generally invest in smaller stocks, were among the most aggressive at investing money over that period, with the cash level falling from 13.5 percent at the end of April, to 10.6 percent at the end of June.</p>
        <p>The opposite trend was seen in precious-metals funds, where fund managers seem to have grown discouraged by the decline in gold prices earlier this year. Although there was a net cash inflow of $38 million into such funds, the managers chose to invest none of it and to raise cash by selling shares. As a result, the cash percentages in such funds rose to 10.3 percent in June, from 7.3 percent a month earlier.</p>
