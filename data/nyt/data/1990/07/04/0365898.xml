        <p>LEAD: The lockout that was the plague and scourge of America during much of the month of March seems to have receded into the mists of history, like the Peloponnesian War. At most, a reference to it is occasionally made.</p>
        <p>The lockout that was the plague and scourge of America during much of the month of March seems to have receded into the mists of history, like the Peloponnesian War. At most, a reference to it is occasionally made.</p>
        <p>And fans, once professing a sickness unto the stomach with, as they saw it, both the grasping players and the rapacious owners, are now going about their business: that of yelling for their winners and assailing their losers.</p>
        <p>Tim McCarver on a baseball broadcast mentions that there will be a few games played next Wednesday, the day after the All-Star Game, normally an off day for all teams. Games are being tucked into assorted off days to get in the full 162-game schedule of a baseball season that was slightly truncated by the late start.</p>
        <p>Someone else wonders, though not for long, if the profusion of no-hitters so far this season has anything to do with the abbreviated spring training.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, David Cone, Mets' pitcher, says that the lack of a full spring training might have hurt endurance. ''At first,'' he said, ''I could only go five or six innings. Now I'm going my normal seven or eight.''</p>
        <p>''In the first week after the strike,'' said Paul O'Neill, the Cincinnati Reds' right fielder, ''we'd hear some fans in the stands hollering at us about the lockout. They'd be grumbling about this or that. But now we don't hear any of that. I think they're just happy that we're nine games in front in our division.''</p>
        <p>It is close to the midway point in the season, and attendance at ball games is good - not just good, record-breaking. As of Tuesday morning, 878 playing dates in both the American League and the National League have been tallied, said Carole Coleman of the baseball commissioner's office, and the total number of fandom that has piled into the 26 big-league ball fields is 22,644,948. This is an increase of 621,184, or 2.8 percent, over last year after 878 playing dates. And at regular season's end last year, 55,173,095 fans paid to see major league ball games in the flesh, setting an attendance record.</p>
        <p>This was more than two million better than the 1988 season, when 52,173,095 spectators clicked through the turnstiles, which also set a record, and that was about one million better than the 1987 season, which set a record, which was 4.5 million better than the record-setting 1986 season, and likewise the season before that. ''I remember during the lockout this spring when people I knew told me, 'That's it, I've had it with baseball,' '' Coleman said.</p>
        <p>''But I think the facts are pretty clear.</p>
        <p>Baseball fans are hooked.''</p>
        <p>All is forgiven, if not forgotten.</p>
        <p>A poll is taken recently in which New Yorkers are asked about George Steinbrenner. Most have a visceral feeling about the Yankees, and Steinbrenner, and baseball. They hate or love with a passion that goes to the depths of their soul.</p>
        <p>The Cincinnati</p>
        <p>Reds' fans can't believe their luck that Lou Piniella, sprung loose by Steinbrenner and his Yankee horde, has their darlings way in front in the standing, a welcome relief from the angst of last year, the dismal Pete Rose season.</p>
        <p>The California and Kansas City and San Diego teams, which plunged into the free-agency market like boys in puddles after a rainstorm, and got soaked, have nonetheless each drawn over a million fans so far this season, much of it generated surely by the excitement of their winter buying sprees.</p>
        <p>In Shea Stadium last Saturday afternoon, in the brilliant sunshine, close to 50,000 fans, the largest gate of the season for the suddenly hot Mets, showed up for a big game against the Reds. Most of them also wore the free Met painter caps, courtesy of Carvel ice cream, that were handed out at the turnstiles. A stadium full of people seated in those hats, which were fluorescent orange, looked like a convention of fireflies.</p>
        <p>In the mezzanine, a man came with two sons and one baseball glove, like so many others there, in case, of course, a foul ball was hit to them. The father sat throughout the game with the glove on, leaning forward in anticipation like an outfielder before every pitch. By the sixth inning, he appeared exhausted from his exertion. The kids didn't seem to mind that the old man hogged the glove. They had their hands full with hot dogs.</p>
        <p>Behind them sat a man named Peter and his son Paul. They discussed the merits of Carreon over McReynolds in left field, and the advisability of replacing Cone with Musselman on the mound.</p>
        <p>At the seventh-inning stretch, Peter, who was born in Austria but came to America at age 10, stood with the crowd as ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' was played. The fans sang and waved their orange caps.</p>
        <p>''This is America,'' he said. ''People in other countries don't understand this. But this is America.''</p>
        <p>And he sang and waved his cap, too, one of the legion of formerly disgruntled fans.</p>
