        <p>The Louisiana Legislature left some 400 bills for Gov. Buddy Roemer when it adjourned last week. The remarkably harsh anti-abortion bill has attracted wide attention.</p>
        <p>People with an eye for history will take a long look, also, at the lottery bill.</p>
        <p>The State Constitution prohibits a lottery, and for good reason. An earlier lottery, established in 1869 by carpetbaggers for a New York gambling syndicate, was so corrupt that other states wanted it banned from using the mails.</p>
        <p>In 1880 President Benjamin Harrison declared that ''the people of all the states are debauched and defrauded'' by Louisiana's game, and persuaded Congress to approve a postal ban. Eventually the lottery was shut down.</p>
        <p>Now the state budget is $600 million in the red, and lottery promoters offer a quick fix. Because the question involves changing the Constitution, it must go to a popular referendum in the fall. Meanwhile the Governor must deal with a bill creating an agency to run it if the referendum carries.</p>
        <p>Governor Roemer opposes a lottery as an unseen tax on the poor. But he says it's the voters' decision. He could help them decide by vetoing the bill on his desk; he would also set a good example for other politicians who succumb to the temptation of lotteries when they can't muster the courage to balance their budgets the old-fashioned way, by cutting spending or raising taxes.</p>
