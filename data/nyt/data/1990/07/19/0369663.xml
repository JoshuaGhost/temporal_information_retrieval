        <p>Top-seeded Andre Agassi, playing for the first time since his loss in the French Open final, struggled through a first-set tie breaker before defeating Brad Pearce, 7-6, 6-3, yesterday in the second round of the Sovran Bank Classic in Washington. Agassi, ranked fourth in the world, trailed, 4-2, in the first set and faced a set point in the tie breaker before winning it, 9-7. Pearce kept up the pressure in the second set before he netted two volleys that gave Agassi the crucial break in the sixth game. Fifth-seeded Michael Chang also moved into the third round of the $415,800 tournament, the first in the American hard-court season heading into the United States Open, with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over Steve Bryan. Derrick Rostagno set up a rematch with John McEnroe, the man he beat in the first round at Wimbledon, by upsetting 13th-seeded Gary Muller of South Africa, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Rostagno and McEnroe will meet in the third round.(AP)</p>
