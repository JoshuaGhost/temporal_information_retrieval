        <p>As the chief scientist for the successful Voyager Project exploring the outer planets, Dr. EDWARD C. STONE has virtually lived at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., for the last 18 years. Now he is to be the next director of the laboratory, which leads the world in planetary exploration.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stone, who is also a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, will succeed Dr. LEW ALLEN JR., who has been the director for eight years and is retiring at the end of the year. Cal Tech operates the laboratory for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stone said he would remain a vice president of the school and continue as chairman of the board of directors of the California Association for Research in Astronomy, which oversees development of the Keck Observatory and Telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Dr. Allen is expected to spend most of his remaining time as director as head of the NASA board investigating the causes of the flawed mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
