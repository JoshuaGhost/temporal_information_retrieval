        <p>LEAD: A candidate for the State Legislature has been asked to resign from the parish council of a Roman Catholic church because he supports a woman's right to have an abortion.</p>
        <p>A candidate for the State Legislature has been asked to resign from the parish council of a Roman Catholic church because he supports a woman's right to have an abortion.</p>
        <p>Msgr. William O'Donnell of Our Lady of Lourdes church in Bethesda, Md., said today that he had already accepted the resignation of John Hurson, who is seeking election from a district where abortion is a major campaign issue. Monsignor O'Donnell said he asked Mr. Hurson to quit the parish council because ''his position was contrary to the teachings of the church.''</p>
        <p>''It's as simple as that. What's the big deal?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hurson denied that he had resigned, adding that he opposes abortion but does not believe the state should pass laws against it.</p>
        <p>Richard Dowling, spokesmen for the Maryland Catholic Conference, said the incident would be the first time a public official or candidate in Maryland or the District of Columbia was disciplined for taking a position favoring abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hurson criticized church officials for trying to stop dissent on the abortion issue. ''It seems to me that Catholics need to have, if they are going to serve in public office, the freedom to represent everyone, not just the Catholic hierarchy,'' he said.</p>
