        <p>LEAD: Larger than a football field and graced with majestic architecture, the McCarren Park swimming pool was considered a wondrous place when it opened in Brooklyn in 1936.</p>
        <p>Larger than a football field and graced with majestic architecture, the McCarren Park swimming pool was considered a wondrous place when it opened in Brooklyn in 1936.</p>
        <p>The pool, which is in the Greenpoint section, could accommodate 6,800 people. From the day it opened, it became a resort for people who could not afford vacations and the hub of the working-class neighborhood's summertime social life.</p>
        <p>Now it sits crumbling, a huge and lonely bulwark against the Manhattan skyline, devastated by neglect, vandals and drug addicts who regularly breach its walls since the pool was closed seven years ago. But it has not been forgotten.  It is the focus of a bitter neighborhood dispute between those who want it restored to its original splendor - including some famous non-neighbors: Spike Lee, the film maker, Eddie Murphy, the actor, and Geraldo Rivera, the television personality -and those who want it modernized and reduced in size.</p>
        <p>But recently the debate has taken on racial overtones.</p>
        <p>In the process the pool has become a metaphor for the ways in which the city's plans can be derailed by the best intentions. ''This is not a story of red tape run amuck,'' said Jack Linn, an assistant parks commissioner, ''but of the problems inherent in the participatory form of government we have chosen.''</p>
        <p>Construction on the pool is unlikely to begin before 1995. But plans cannot proceed until the Landmarks Commission rules on whether to confer landmark status on the McCarren Park pool and the 10 other giant pools built in 1936 by Robert Moses. If it does, then plans for major renovation would require the approval of several governmental agencies.</p>
        <p>Haven for Drug Dealers</p>
        <p>Renovation was to have begun in 1984, but was halted by the objections of residents living near the pool, who wanted it closed for good. They contended that the pool had become overrun by thousands of teen-agers and had become a haven for drug dealers and prostitutes.</p>
        <p>After more than a year of study by a committee drawn from a broad spectrum of the neighborhood, the local community board adopted a plan to turn the pool complex into a year-round recreational center. The plan included the demolition of the decrepit bathhouse wings, construction of a modern gymnasium and community center and reduction of the pool to Olympic size. The capacity would be cut from 6,800, the largest in the city, to 2,000.</p>
        <p>But Phyllis Yampolsky, a Williamsburg artist, protested that the city was planning to destroy an architectural treasure.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason whatsoever to destroy the wings,'' she said. ''They are structurally sound, beautiful and functional. In another culture, another time, people would have welcomed the fact that they had an architectural treasure in their midst.''</p>
        <p>'You Can't Get In'</p>
        <p>Despite an eventual compromise -the community board agreed not to demolish the wings - the factions continued to squabble over the pool's size and the gymnasium.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yampolsky, who is white, contends that the move to shrink the pool is an effort to keep out black and Hispanic youths from neighboring Williamsburg and other nearby sections. Others agree with her.  ''As an African-American, I think this is racist,'' said Mildred Tudy, an educator who is a member of the community board. ''The pool will be so small that they could justifiably say to Latinos and African-Americans: 'It's full already. You can't get in.' ''</p>
        <p>''We consider it our pool, too,'' said Luis Garden Acosta, who heads El Puente, a Hispanic youth organization in Williamsburg. ''This issue is not largeness or smallness, but whether a large pool would be a magnet for Latino and African-American youth.''</p>
        <p>'Racism Was Not an Issue'</p>
        <p>Those who disagree with Ms. Yampolsky say that assertions of racism are totally unfounded and that the residents of Greenpoint and Williamsburg - including Polish, Irish, Italian, Jewish, black and Hispanic people - co-exist in reasonable harmony.</p>
        <p>''Racism was not an issue, but if you press the right button, it comes up. So it did,'' said Inez Pasher, a white member of the community board.</p>
        <p>'We need a pool that is safe and manageable for everyone,'' said DebraAnn E. DeSoye, who is white and the chairwoman of the Friends of McCarren Park. ''We don't live in 1936 anymore but in 1990. Put 6,000 people in one pool and you can imagine the chaos that will follow if a fight breaks out.''</p>
        <p>What is needed in 1990, both factions agree, is a center that operates year round, offering a broad variety of recreational programs, especially for the young and the elderly. But they continue to disagree about where to house such a center.</p>
        <p>The board and the parks department favor building a gym that would have meeting rooms and possibly a theater. Ms. Yampolsky's group, the Independent Friends of McCarren Park, say a full size gym is not necessary.</p>
        <p>As the years have passed, many residents have lost track of the saga of their pool. But Domenic Fasano knows well that he has no convenient place to take his sons, ages 15 and 3 years old, for a swim. They must travel 45 minutes to Rockaway Beach or Jones Beach.</p>
        <p>''When I was a baby, my father took me to that pool,'' said Mr. Fasano, a sanitation worker. ''To see my sons in the pool is to see myself, but I haven't been able to do that. To see the park condemned, with broken glass everywhere, with reeds and trees growing in the pool is to say, 'Wow, look at how something so precious could be destroyed.' ''</p>
