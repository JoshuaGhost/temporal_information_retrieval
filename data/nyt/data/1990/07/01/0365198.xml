        <p>LEAD: Bill Carter's article ''Forecast for 'Today': Cloudy'' (June 10) was excellent, but it doesn't go far enough. The emotion isn't there and it really needs to be. There, in front of millions every morning - most of them women, and mothers - is this outrageous misogynist, Bryant Gumbel. We watched as Jane Pauley was removed from the show, only to be replaced by the kind of woman many women find most threatening - the eternal plastic blonde - who mindlessly defers to this locker-roomJU bully.</p>

        <p>Bill Carter's article ''Forecast for 'Today': Cloudy'' (June 10) was excellent, but it doesn't go far enough. The emotion isn't there and it really needs to be. There, in front of millions every morning - most of them women, and mothers - is this outrageous misogynist, Bryant Gumbel. We watched as Jane Pauley was removed from the show, only to be replaced by the kind of woman many women find most threatening - the eternal plastic blonde - who mindlessly defers to this locker-roomJU bully. Now he has increased his blondes (cheerleaders?) to two, and has brought on a sports pal. NBC, in its wisdom, has offered this audience of women - what? A sports show! Male indulgence stuffed down our throats at breakfast.</p>
        <p>Compare all this to ''Good Morning America.'' Charlie Gibson is intelligent, decent, warm. There isn't a scoff in him. Joan Lunden speaks out like a human being without that side glance of fear that's seen in the women on Bryant's show. Gumbel thinks the people who sit next to him appear to be in slow motion because of his dazzling genius; but, actually, when anyone has to work next to someone who has the power, and the propensity, to fire colleagues, one tends to become diminished.</p>
