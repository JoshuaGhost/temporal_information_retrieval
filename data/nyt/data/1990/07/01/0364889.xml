        <p>It looks like a space ship and its job is to snoop. The RPV Cypher (above) was designed by the Sikorsky helicopter subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation to be a pilotless surveillance drone. About six feet in diameter and weighing 300 pounds, the vehicle can take off and land vertically and hover over targets. Inside the donut-shaped vehicle are two rotors which turn in opposite directions. The Cypher is designed to cruise at 80 knots for up to four hours and to go as high as 8,000 feet. Two-way data links would allow ground controllers to fly it and receive data from its sensors.</p>
