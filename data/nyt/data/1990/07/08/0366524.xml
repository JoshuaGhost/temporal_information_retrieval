        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Who's Afraid of Foreign Ideas?'' (editorial, June 16), in support of Representative Howard Berman's bill, you state, ''it's scarcely surprising that Communist regimes in Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam now worry about infection from Western visitors.''</p>
        <p>Not true of Cuba, which is expanding its tourist industry. Cuba needs the hard currency and welcomes tourists from the West. I met great numbers of tourists in Havana this year from Canada, West Germany, Britain, Ireland and France. The few United States citizens I met were not tourists. They had been permitted to go because they fulfilled certain United States Government criteria.</p>
        <p>Your statement that United States citizens may travel legally to Cuba is misleading. My credentials as a journalist enabled me to go to Cuba this year and four years ago. Before I left for Cuba this year, I received a pamphlet, ''What You Need to Know About the U.S. Embargo,'' issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury. An excerpt should dispel any notion that it is easy for United States citizens to travel legally to Cuba:</p>
        <p>''Spending money related to Cuban travel is restricted. This restriction includes spending money in connection with tourist, business or recreational trips, whether travelers go di-rectly to Cuba or via a third country . . . Penalties for violating the sanctions range up to 12 years in prison, $500,000 in corporate and $250,000 in individual fines.''</p>
        <p>The United States Government has also denied ABC permission to televise the Pan-American Games scheduled for Havana next year for rebroadcast to the United States.</p>
        <p>Representative Berman's bill would restore the rights of citizens to travel to Cuba and could lead - one would hope - to lifting the trade embargo against Cuba and the normalization of relations with Cuba. It is time Washington's Berlin Wall came tumbling down!</p>
