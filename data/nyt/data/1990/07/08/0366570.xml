        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the author of ''A Cast of Killers,'' a book about King Vidor's investigation of the 1922 murder of the movie director William Desmond Taylor, I would like to respond to Otto Friedrich's review of ''A Deed of Death'' by Robert Giroux (June 10). There was much I liked about the review, but what Mr. Friedrich failed to point out is that Mr. Giroux has relied exclusively on archival newspaper reports to ''solve'' the Taylor murder.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Giroux never tells his readers what the Los Angeles Police Department knew for certain in 1941: that the actress Mary Miles Minter once tried to shoot herself with a pistol identical to the one used in the Taylor murder; that her mother, Charlotte Shelby, had threatened Taylor as well as three other film directors she believed had made amorous advances toward her daughter; and that large sums of money were paid to Carl Stockdale, Charlotte Shelby's alibi and the man who detectives believed was seen leaving the scene of the crime after the shooting. All of this information, available to King Vidor from the police department, has long since become a matter of public record and can be verified in the Los Angeles City Archives.</p>
        <p>Police reports aside, Mr. Giroux also fails to take advantage of the explosive new information that emerged in 1987, once Mary Miles Minter's estate went into probate and her papers were put up for sale through Publishers Weekly. Among the items in Minter's estate were family journals, private correspondence and two unpublished autobiographies that detail a trip she and her mother made to Taylor's bungalow on the night of the murder, something Mr. Giroux never even hints at in his book.</p>
