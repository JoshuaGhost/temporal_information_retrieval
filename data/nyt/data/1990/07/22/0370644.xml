        <p>''My mother would never have consented to my making my first appearance in a public room, so to Mrs. Morton's we went,'' the novelist Edith Wharton wrote, as she recalled coming out into society in 1879. ''Mrs. Morton's'' was a sturdy brick dwelling, with handsome arched windows, at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street. Anna Morton lived there with her husband, Levi, a prominent banker who later became Vice President of the United States and Governor of New York.</p>
        <p>Today, the 130-year-old house, which is not a landmark, is surrounded by a demolition contractor's sidewalk shed. It is destined to disappear by October, after asbestos has been removed.</p>
        <p>The six-story structure was purchased for $10.6 million in 1987 by Touko America Company, a subsidiary of the Touko Haus development concern of Tokyo. Touko recently bought an adjacent 15-story office tower at 1 East 42d Street, plus an attached seven-story building at 4 East 43d Street, for about $30 million. Taken together, the three parcels form an L-shaped site that could yield a new 190,000-square-foot building.</p>
