        <p>The article ''Effort on Affordable Housing Is Falling Short of Goal'' (May 27) provided an excellent update on the status of affordable housing in New Jersey. With due respect to the tireless efforts of many builders, nonprofit organizations, the Council on Affordable Housing and the State Division of Housing Development, I would like to point out the following.</p>
        <p>* If the central concern is to increase the supply of affordable housing, attention needs to be focused away from new construction and toward rehabilitation of existing structures. In New Jersey, where many of the older towns and cities have abandoned buildings and neighborhoods, much can be done to turn them into lively places for people. Economic incentives for rehabilitation, technical assistance, streamlining of zoning and building regulations and other actions may accelerate the supply of affordable housing much more rapidly than new construction.</p>
        <p>* For the first-time home buyers, two big obstacles are the ability to qualify for a mortgage and the down payment. Employer assistance as well as innovative financing techniques can certainly help in removing these obstacles.</p>
        <p>* While many builders are looking for innovative and efficient methods of building construction, very little has changed in the way the buildings are built today. With the exception of modular building systems used by some of the builders, the building methods remain conventional and costly. Investment in research and experimentation are critical in the building industry.</p>
        <p>* Participation of homeowners in some aspects of home design and construction is necessary for developing appropriate forms of housing units as well as for giving the homeowners an opportunity to personalize their homes. The sweat equity in the construction process would reduce costs and improve livability.</p>
        <p>* While family living is a key reason for owning a home, the demographic trends suggest newer forms of households or families, like single parents, married couples without children, unmarried couples living together, elderly couples, the single elderly, the disabled and so on. The demographic trends also suggest a change in life style from being home-centered to work-centered. Designs of homes and neighborhoods as well as financing techniques need to respond to these changing trends.</p>
