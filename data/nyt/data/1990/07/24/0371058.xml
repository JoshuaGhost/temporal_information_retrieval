        <p>LEAD: rrIn the years when Bobby Jones dominated golf, he was known as ''the mechanical man.'' Just wind him up and send him clicking around a course. But if Jones was golf's ''mechanical man,'' Nick Faldo is now its ''computer disk.'' Just program him and point him to the first tee.</p>
        <p>rrIn the years when Bobby Jones dominated golf, he was known as ''the mechanical man.'' Just wind him up and send him clicking around a course. But if Jones was golf's ''mechanical man,'' Nick Faldo is now its ''computer disk.'' Just program him and point him to the first tee.</p>
        <p>While winning the British Open at St. Andrews over the weekend, Faldo was seldom seen anywhere but walking down the middle of the fairway, then walking onto the green. If he didn't hole his birdie putt, he usually left himself a tap-in. Seldom has any golfer won a major championship with such virtual perfection. He shot 67, 65, 67 and then a careful 71 for a five-stroke triumph.</p>
        <p>On the Old Course where bunkers of all sizes, shapes and sorrows wait in ambush, the 33-year-old Englishman's ball found the sand only once. On its vast greens, he never three-putted. In the process, Faldo silenced all the arguments about who is currently ''the world's best golfer.'' Unlike the world heayvweight boxing champion, a golfer seldom has a title match. But for Saturday's third round, Faldo was paired with Greg Norman, ''the world's best golfer,'' according to something called the Sony rankings. To heighten the theatrics, each was 12 under par as they teed off with the British Open lead at stake over golf's most hallowed linksland.</p>
        <p>In their title match, Faldo shot 67 and Norman shot 76 with five three-putt greens. Just think of it as an 18-hole knockout.</p>
        <p>Norman somehow still leads the Sony rankings, but its computer obviously isn't programmed as well as ''the computer disk'' himself.</p>
        <p>Winning major championships is the most convincing way to earn the title of ''the world's best golfer.'' As the reigning Masters champion with back-to-back victories at Augusta National, Faldo has now won three majors in two years, and four in four years, starting with the 1987 British Open at Muirfield.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Norman has won only one major, the 1986 British Open. He's been close in several other majors, but nobody gets a trophy for being close.</p>
        <p>Norman has flair, his flying flaxen hair and soaring tee shots, but Faldo has the game, solid and steady. Faldo also has the demeanor, cool and commanding.</p>
        <p>If a golfer is known by the company he keeps, Faldo has now hoisted himself onto an exclusive plateau with only seven others, each a sacrosanct name in golf history: Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Ben Hogan, Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen. Over a two-year span only Faldo and those seven have won three titles in what are now considered to be golf's four major tournaments: the United States Open, the British Open, the Masters and the Professional Golfers Association Championship.</p>
        <p>And if Faldo were to win the P.G.A. at Shoal Creek outside Birmingham, Ala., in two weeks, he would be the first to win four of those four major titles in two years. With three in one year, he would match Hogan's 1953 sweep of the two Opens and the Masters. Faldo knows Shoal Creek. He finished tied for 20th in the 1984 P.G.A. there when Lee Trevino won. Two years ago, he finished tied for fourth in the P.G.A. at Oak Tree; last year he tied for ninth at Kemper Lakes.</p>
        <p>Were it not for a 15-foot putt that lipped out on the final hole of the United States Open at Medinah outside Chicago last month, Faldo would have joined Hale Irwin and Mike Donald in the 18-hole playoff that Irwin won. If he had won that Open playoff and survived the hoopla that would have surrounded him at St. Andrews, he would be shooting for an unprecedented pro Grand Slam at Shoal Creek.</p>
        <p>Even so, Faldo has separated himself from today's other golfers just as the other sacrosanct seven did in their time.</p>
        <p>Over four years, Hogan won six majors. Over three years, Palmer won five. Over four years, Nicklaus and Watson each won five. Over two years, Nicklaus won three majors five different times. Nicklaus and Hagen each won seven majors over six years. Jones and Hagen, of course, were past their best years when the Masters began in 1934. And as an amateur, Jones never competed in the P.G.A.</p>
        <p>But now that Faldo has joined those sacrosanct seven, maybe he will be appreciated for what he's accomplished.</p>
        <p>When he won the 1987 British Open at Muirfield with 18 pars in the final round, people talked about Paul Azinger's problems on the final holes. When he won the 1989 Masters on the second playoff hole, people talked about Scott Hoch missing a 2-foot putt. When he won this year's Masters on the second playoff hole, more people talked about Raymond Floyd yanking a 7-iron into the pond.</p>
        <p>More often than not, ''the world's best golfer'' is a title bestowed too carelessly, sometimes week by week or major by major. But in joining the sacrosanct seven, Nick Faldo deserves the title of golf's heavyweight champion.</p>
        <p>And he wears it well.</p>
