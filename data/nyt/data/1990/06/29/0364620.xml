        <p>LEAD: Sgt. Edgar DeLeon of the New York Police Department's Bias Investigation Unit glanced through the case folder with a sheaf of pink typewritten reports, absorbing the details of an attack by four black men on two Hispanic men in the Bronx. His fingers shuffled through Polaroid photographs, pausing at one of a seven-inch purple gash across a victim's head.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Edgar DeLeon of the New York Police Department's Bias Investigation Unit glanced through the case folder with a sheaf of pink typewritten reports, absorbing the details of an attack by four black men on two Hispanic men in the Bronx. His fingers shuffled through Polaroid photographs, pausing at one of a seven-inch purple gash across a victim's head.</p>
        <p>''Something here doesn't add up,'' Sergeant DeLeon said. ''It's going against human nature, and human nature is a pretty consistent thing. People don't just get out of a car and beat the hell out of other people for no reason.''</p>
        <p>It is 11:30 A.M. on a recent Tuesday, and Sergeant DeLeon and two detectives are going to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx to interview Edgar Bone, a 35-year-old Ecuadorean house painter whose head was split open in the attack.</p>
        <p>The case is typical of crimes the bias unit investigates, because the motive is the all-important mystery. Most detectives need to find out only who did what to whom, but for Sergeant DeLeon and the 21 bias investigators, uncovering the motive is as important as finding the criminals. Even after an arrest, the bias squad must determine whether the crime was prompted by bigotry.</p>
        <p>And unlike other detectives who track down perpetrators of obscure crimes ignored by reporters, the bias squad operates in the limelight of a city where racial tensions dominate the news, influence elections, provoke demonstrations and become political causes celebre.</p>
        <p>Some turn out to be hoaxes by disturbed people desperate for attention. Others are bona fide hate crimes, including some of the city's most heinous killings: the Howard Beach incident that led to the death of Michael Griffith; the fatal shooting of Yusuf K. Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn last August; the fatal stabbing of John Zappalorti on Staten Island in January because he was believed to be gay.</p>
        <p>But investigators say most cases lie in a murky region where bigotry and other motives both play roles. The problem is deciding whether the crime was mainly the result of prejudice.</p>
        <p>''If I can,'' Sergeant DeLeon said, ''I want to get into the mind of the perpetrator and find out why it happened.''</p>
        <p>That is not easy, unless the person arrested admits his motive was prejudice, or if a symbol of bigotry - a swastika or the letters K.K.K. - are found, said Inspector Paul Sanderson, the commander of the unit.</p>
        <p>In other cases, the detectives must look elsewhere: Did the crime involve two ethnic groups? Is there no other possible motive, like money or jealousy? Have others of the same background been attacked in the neighborhood? Did the attackers select the victim from others of different backgrounds?</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you don't know, and you will never know,'' Inspector Sanderson said. ''You may know in all probability it was bias, but you can't get the evidence to prove it.''</p>
        <p>The bias unit was formed on Dec. 19, 1980, after a study showed an increase in racial attacks. At first, it was only a captain and seven investigators.</p>
        <p>The unit investigated and catalogued 1,300 crimes before December 1986, when the Howard Beach incident stunned the city and prompted a flood of new reports of bias attacks. Responding to public outcry, Commissioner Benjamin Ward put a higher-ranking inspector in charge of the unit and increased the staff.</p>
        <p>Since 1987, the unit has investigated 1,554 cases and made arrests or found suspects in a third of them, according to Police Department statistics. Most were misdemeanors that would have received little or no attention from a local precinct, investigators said.</p>
        <p>A third of the cases were assaults, not unlike the one on the Ecuadoreans, the statistics show. About 28 percent were cases of aggravated harassment: pushing and shoving, threatening telephone calls and letters. About 7 percent were milder forms of harassment, usually people yelling racial epithets. About 21 percent were cases of criminal mischief, like racist graffiti. Four percent were robberies and 2 percent were burglaries. The rest were miscellaneous cases.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of the people arrested during that period were under the age of 19, and 40 percent were younger than 16, the police said.</p>
        <p>''I think many of us as parents forget that kids are very impressionable,'' Inspector Sanderson said. ''They begin to act out what they hear and they act it out much worse.''</p>
        <p>Not all the crimes remain bias cases. Last year, the unit investigated a record 577 cases and eventually determined 35 were not motivated by bias. Of the remaining unsolved cases, many remain classified as bias despite the detectives' doubts.</p>
        <p>No Extra Penalty for Bias Crimes</p>
        <p>Under state law, there is no extra penalty for bias crimes, although a bill mired in a partisan battle in the State Senate would increase sentences for hate crimes.</p>
        <p>The most the detectives can do is tack on a charge of aggravated harassment or a violation of the state civil rights law, both of which carry a penalty of up to one year in prison. In most cases, if a defendant is convicted of a felony, these extra charges do not lengthen the final sentence, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>Police officials said the unit was formed because public officials recognized a need to deal directly with bias as a motive in violent crime. ''Many of these are minor crimes,'' said Inspector Sanderson. ''But we treat them as if they were homicides.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the Hate Crime Statistics Act, signed by President Bush in April, requires local governments to keep track of bias crimes and report them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Only a handful of cities, including Miami, Boston, Chicago and Baltimore, have bias units.</p>
        <p>Piloting their battered Ford Fairmont toward the Bronx, the detectives are skeptical of the account of the attack on Mr. Bone. The other victim, Fernando Loor, a 25-year-old garment worker, told the police that he and Mr. Bone were hailing a gypsy cab on Jerome Avenue near 212th Street at 6:40 A.M. on May 27 when four black men stopped in a cream-colored Toyota and beat them for no reason.</p>
        <p>One man hit Mr. Bone twice with a baseball bat and said, ''You [expletive]  Spanish people,'' Mr. Loor told investigators. ''That rang some bells with us,'' said Detective Anthony Alicea. ''I can think of about 20 other things I would call someone before 'Spanish.' It ain't street, you know what I mean?''</p>
        <p>At the hospital, Sergeant DeLeon speaks in gentle, fluid Spanish to Mr. Bone. An intravenous tube runs into his right hand and a green screen blinks his vital signs. There is a blood clot in his brain, doctors say.</p>
        <p>Rubbing his head, Mr. Bone tells a story that differs on several major points from Mr. Loor's. For example, he says several times that he was not present when the fight began.</p>
        <p>'I'm Beginning to Have My Doubts'</p>
        <p>''Why did they start to beat Fernando?'' Sergeant DeLeon asks.</p>
        <p>''This I don't know,'' Mr. Bone says. ''He knows.'' Outside the room, Sergeant DeLeon tells the detectives he wants to speak to Mr. Loor.</p>
        <p>On the way to Manhattan in a pouring rain, Sergeant DeLeon's beeper sounds and the detectives stop at a pay telephone. He returns to the car and says, ''The Bronx Borough President called the captain and wants to know what's going on with this case.''</p>
        <p>In the squad's windowless office on the 13th Floor of Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, several investigators are typing pink follow-up reports, known as DD-5's, drinking coffee and talking over cases. A radio atop a partition plays soft jazz.</p>
        <p>Sergeant DeLeon says it is hard to press victims like the Ecuadoreans. ''These guys are not bad guys,'' he says. ''But the story here is convoluted, and the story is very important to us.''</p>
        <p>At 5 P.M., Sergeant DeLeon calls a number he was given for Mr. Loor's work place. It turns out to be disconnected. ''I'm beginning to have my doubts about Fernando,'' he says.</p>
        <p>That night Mr. Bone's condition worsens. Doctors operate to remove the blood clot. The next morning, Sergeant DeLeon and another investigator confront Mr. Loor with Mr. Bone's version of the events.</p>
        <p>''Are you sure you did nothing to provoke the attack?'' Sergeant DeLeon asks in Spanish. Mr. Loor insists he left a party with Mr. Bone and they were hailing a cab when they were attacked. They both had been drinking all night. ''This case has gotten a lot of attention,'' Sergeant DeLeon says. ''And it's going to continue to get more attention. Something is missing. I tell you frankly, this is very strange in my experience.'' Mr. Loor insists he told the truth.</p>
        <p>If no other witness can be found, the case will remain classified as a bias case, and could create tensions between Hispanic people and blacks, Sergeant DeLeon said.</p>
        <p>''It could turn into a real fiasco,'' he said. ''God forbid Edgar should die.''</p>
        <p>At 4 P.M., Detective John Leslie, who was originally assigned to the assault case, arrives for his tour. Sergeant DeLeon fills him in. Detective Leslie says he believes Mr. Loor, because Mr. Bone's head injury might have confused him.</p>
        <p>'I Hate These Cases'</p>
        <p>Both agree Mr. Loor is not telling the whole truth. ''Something had to happen to provoke it to this point,'' Detective Leslie says.</p>
        <p>He shakes his head. ''I hate these cases because they become real mysteries. In a case like this, everybody jumps on the bandwagon but nobody has the facts. And this guy doesn't understand English, so how does he interpret it as a racial incident?''</p>
        <p>The following weekend, a bus driver who says he saw the attack while driving south on Jerome Avenue will come forward and give an different version of events.</p>
        <p>But the license plate number of the car that the driver says the attackers fled in will be traced to Cadillac owned by a Yonkers man who was nowhere near the Bronx during the attack. Several days later, after returning home, Mr. Bone will change his story again to coincide with Mr. Loor's.</p>
        <p>After three and half weeks of investigation, there will be 17 DD-5 follow-up reports in the pea-green case file, but no arrests. Detectives will have canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses seven times, reinterviewed the victims three times, searched through crime reports in four precincts, interviewed Mr. Loor's family and run several computer checks on license plate numbers resembling the one the bus driver remembered.</p>
        <p>In the end, the case will remain a bias attack - No. 246 of the year - despite the skepticism of the detectives.</p>
        <p>''There are three sides to every story,'' Sergeant DeLeon muses. ''Your side, my side and the truth.''</p>
