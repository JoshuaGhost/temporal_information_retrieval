        <p>LEAD: Two years after the New York State Legislature set aside $85 million to build permanent housing for homeless families in New York City, the Cuomo administration says it has grown impatient because the money has not been spent, and it is threatening to give some of it to suburban counties.</p>
        <p>Two years after the New York State Legislature set aside $85 million to build permanent housing for homeless families in New York City, the Cuomo administration says it has grown impatient because the money has not been spent, and it is threatening to give some of it to suburban counties.</p>
        <p>State and city housing officials blame one another for delays that have kept the money tied up. The state says the city was slow to provide abandoned buildings and vacant land on which to create new housing. Municipal housing officials say that they did offer sites but that state officials were not satisfied with the properties.</p>
        <p>Now Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has proposed a change in state law that would make as much as $50 million of the $85 million available to Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties. City housing officials and some lawmakers vow to block the plan, which some officials said would make the housing agency headed by the Governor's son Andrew the main beneficiary.</p>
        <p>The dispute comes as the city is struggling to remove homeless families from emergency quarters in rundown welfare hotels and city shelters and when Federal subsidies for permanent, low-income housing have all but vanished. While the loss of some of the state money would not cripple the city's efforts, the angry debate between the city and state underscores the fierce competition for housing dollars and for political recognition.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee, said Andrew Cuomo, through a nonprofit housing agency called HELP, which he operates, would be able to use some of the money that had been reserved for the city. Mr. Cuomo could finance housing projects for the homeless in Westchester and Suffolk Counties, the lawmaker said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grannis said his chief aide had been lobbied by an aide to Andrew Cuomo to support the change in the law proposed by the Cuomo administration.</p>
        <p>Andrew Cuomo said he supported the effort to shift some of the money to the suburbs, but along with state housing officials, he denied that the state was motivated by a desire to aid his group.</p>
        <p>''I happen to think the bill makes sense,'' he said. ''The money has been available for the homeless for two years, and it has not been utilized. The suburbs have a tremendous housing problem. If you have money appropriated and you have people sleeping on the streets in the suburbs, why not use it in the suburbs?''</p>
        <p>He also noted that there were many more housing renovation and construction programs for the homeless in the city than in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Commitment to City Noted</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Grannis, as committee chairman, introduced the bill for the Cuomo administration. But he said it ''is not going anywhere,'' because the money has been set aside solely for the city under a complex legislative agreement in 1988.</p>
        <p>''This money was committed to the city,'' he said. ''It is going to stay in the city.''</p>
        <p>Richard L. Higgins, Commissioner of the State Department of Housing and Community Renewal, said the state wanted to offer some of the money to the suburbs because of the city's ''general unwillingness to proceed expeditiously.''</p>
        <p>''We made this money available,'' he said. ''If it wasn't going to be spent and buildings weren't going to be made available, there were other areas of the state where it was desperately needed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins called Mr. Grannis's remarks about Andrew Cuomo ''a smokescreen for the city's problems on spending the money.''</p>
        <p>The dispute centers on a compromise reached two years ago over how to spend $326 million in state surplus money on housing. The $85 million was reserved for the city under the legislative agreement, and $241 million was made available statewide for other low- and moderate-income housing programs.</p>
        <p>One Project Approved</p>
        <p>Only one organization has been approved so far to use the state money for permanent housing in the city - Mr. Cuomo's HELP. Construction is scheduled to begin next month on 150 new apartments in the East New York section of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Another nonprofit group, the Coalition for the Homeless, has received preliminary approval to rebuild an abandoned building in East Harlem with 15 apartments. The state agency overseeing the housing program for the homeless, the Housing Finance Agency, has not yet approved this project, however.</p>
        <p>In addition, bids were received last month for a contract to build housing on five different sites in the South Bronx and Harlem. A total of 320 apartments are to be built.</p>
        <p>Together the first three projects would use $35 million of the $85 million state pool. The city matches each dollar spent by the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins said the program had not moved more quickly because the city was slow to provide vacant land and abandoned buildings. He also said the city had prolonged the process by insisting that the sites be reviewed by local community boards.</p>
        <p>Mix of Tenants Approved</p>
        <p>There was also a lengthy debate over whether all of the apartments should go to the homeless, or whether the new buildings would remain more stable in the long run if they contained a mix of homeless and other families. The state, which insisted on a mix, ultimately prevailed.</p>
        <p>Such difficulties ''highlight some things that just slowed down the program from our point of view,'' Mr. Higgins said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Grannis said state officials had insisted that the 1988 law required the city to provide sites to the state and to obtain approval from community boards and the Board of Estimate.</p>
        <p>''It was written to make sure the city took all the heat for the siting decisions,'' Mr. Grannis said.</p>
        <p>City officials said they had warned the state that most of the larger abandoned buildings in the city's inventory had already been assigned to developers and nonprofit groups under the city's own housing plans.</p>
        <p>Only smaller buildings at less desirable locations were left, said city officials, who asserted that state officials were slow to understand that the city was not withholding more desirable sites from them.</p>
        <p>State Inexperience Cited</p>
        <p>Some municipal officials said another reason for delays was that the State Housing Finance Agency had never before developed low-income housing.</p>
        <p>''We built thousands of units during that time, thousands,'' said Felice Michetti, Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''That's why to say that the delays were our fault makes no sense.''</p>
        <p>The city has overseen the completion of 4,300 new apartments in formerly abandoned buildings over the last four years, said Roz Post, a spokeswoman for the city housing department. A total of 15,000 more apartments are being built. About a third are for the homeless.</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins has said he will continue the city's housing efforts, which were begun by his predecessor, Edward I. Koch. As Manhattan Borough President and a member of the Board of Estimate, Mr. Dinkins voted to approve most housing initiatives undertaken by the Koch administration.</p>
        <p>The state's development efforts have been modest by comparison. The most successful state effort, called the ''turnkey'' program, has spent $128 million of the surplus money in the last two years to build or completely renovate low- and moderate-income housing. Eleven projects are being built, with 121 units completed. Construction is scheduled to start by September on 11 projects. Overall, nearly 1,200 apartments are to be created.</p>
