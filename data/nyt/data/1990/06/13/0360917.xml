        <p>LEAD: The Soviet Parliament today approved a law on freedom of the press that is intended to end decades of Government censorship and allow individual citizens to start newspapers.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Parliament today approved a law on freedom of the press that is intended to end decades of Government censorship and allow individual citizens to start newspapers.</p>
        <p>The law, hailed by its supporters as the first in the nation's history to detail guarantees for journalists, is the latest step in the policy of glasnost, or increased openness, introduced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>But the new law does not deal with with what journalists say is the equally basic problem of the Government's monopoly on the limited supply of printing paper.</p>
        <p>Sweeping Statement of Principle</p>
        <p>As a statement of principle, the law is sweeping, flatly declaring, ''Censorship of mass information is not allowed.''</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, its effects will be closely followed by such proponents as Anatoly Yezhelev, a member of Parliament and leader of the Leningrad Union of Journalists, who said tonight that free-press advocates had beaten back all ''changes for the worse'' and even established the right for any individual 18 years or older to begin a newspaper.</p>
        <p>Critics of the new law had sought to keep newspaper publishing a prerogative of the nation's institutional and collective enterprises, a device that helped cement the Communist Party's long monopoly and still considerable residual powers over the nation's mass communications.</p>
        <p>Newspaper and magazine workers have been complaining lately about the chronic shortage of newsprint and the Government's power to allocate it to preferred organs and diminish the voice of critics. But Mr. Yezhelev said the new law was shaped to address the basic principles needed for a free press.</p>
        <p>He said the advent of a freer economy, which is being promised in the next five years by the Gorbachev Government, should make paper adequately and fairly available. In the meantime, he said, independent publishers can contract with job printers. But that process still relies ultimately on Government control and distribution of paper.</p>
        <p>Party's Traditional Power</p>
        <p>The press has been in a great state of flux, with public attention beginning to offset the party's traditional power in cases like that of Vladislav A. Starkov, editor of the nation's most popular newspaper, the weekly Argumenty i Fakty. He was targeted for removal by President Gorbachev but has held on to his job by simply refusing the Kremlin's demand that he leave.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Kremlin is accused of using publishing's economic factors as a lever. Sergei Zalygin, editor of Novy Mir, long the nation's most respected literary journal, has repeatedly complained that the Government has exploited the paper shortage to punish the more critical publications.</p>
        <p>The press law was approved after months of revision and debate, with considerable attention paid to international human rights standards, which the Gorbachev Government has pledged to uphold in its campaign to gain full world standing and the economic benefits that might entail.</p>
        <p>The new law does not satisfy all free-press advocates. Some are suspicious of a new requirement that newspapers be registered with central or local government executive councils. The penalty for publishing without official registration would be up to 200 rubles - about three weeks' salary for the average worker - plus possible confiscation of the newspaper and its plant.</p>
        <p>Requirement Called Technical</p>
        <p>But Mr. Yezhelev said that the registration requirement was not intended as a device for limiting the number of newspapers and that the law allowed ''very few'' grounds for rejecting potential publishers. He said the grounds were only technical ones like the concern that newspaper titles not be duplicated.</p>
        <p>''All the main democratic articles we fought for were left in,'' Mr. Yezhelev said.</p>
        <p>The articles in the law include a statement of journalists' rights, including the right to withhold bylines from ''material distorted during editing'' and to refuse assignments that run counter to personal convictions.</p>
        <p>Newspapers will also have the right to try suing Government agencies that refuse to supply information. The risks of disclosing stories based on secret Government information are to rest with the sources, not with the newspaper that publishes the stories.</p>
        <p>Soviet news outlets have changed considerably in Mr. Gorbachev's five years of power, principally in inviting and tolerating a greater degree of criticism of the Government. But the current political changes, in which insurgent political forces are scoring initial victories, have demonstrated the continuing power of the Communist Party in owning and physically controlling most printing presses and television stations.</p>
        <p>Insurgent City Governments</p>
        <p>Battles are being waged here and in Leningrad between new city governments controlled by insurgents and traditional party machines for communications power, with the party thus far maintaining its dominant edge and facing no threat of action in the traditionally weak Soviet court system.</p>
        <p>The new law bars political interference in broadcasting and the press. It also bars newspapers from printing pornography, calls to violent overthrow of the Government or appeals to religious and racial intolerance.</p>
        <p>The law also attempts to allow press enterprises to be more profit-motivated and independent of traditional bureaucracies, with the right to run their own finances and to open bank accounts. This is a right already extended theoretically in some other spheres, where critics say the bureaucrats still reign arbitrarily.</p>
