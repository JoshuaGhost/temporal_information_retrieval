        <p>LEAD: Yields of taxable and tax-exempt money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were lower for the week ended yesterday.</p>
        <p>Yields of taxable and tax-exempt money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were lower for the week ended yesterday.</p>
        <p>The yields of money market funds are beginning to shadow the decline that has been prevalent in the rest of the fixed-income market. This decline has been strongest among longer-term issues. The Federal Reserve Bank is holding short-term rates stable.</p>
        <p>Falling Retail Sales Noted</p>
        <p>Walter S. Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's, noted that the sharp drop in monthly retail sales reported yesterday was a lot stronger than expected. ''It doesn't appear that the rest of this week's economic data will be inflationary,'' he said, ''and change the market's present thinking that rates will continue to decline with some backing and filling.''</p>
        <p>The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios is 43, down from 44 last week.</p>
        <p>Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund fell by a basis point, to 7.95 percent, as did the 30-day average yield, to 7.98 percent.</p>
        <p>Assets of taxable funds increased $1.2 billion, to $377.1 billion. Institutional assets fell $400 million, to $79 billion, while consumer assets increased $1.6 billion, to $298.1 billion. Analysts said declines in bank C.D. yields had made yields of money market funds more attractive, since they usually lag when rates rise or fall.</p>
        <p>Alger Fund's Return Is Highest</p>
        <p>Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million surveyed by IBC/ Donoghue's, the Alger Money Market Portfolio, distributed by Fred Alger &amp; Company of Jersey City, showed the best return for the week, with a yield of 8.86 percent.</p>
        <p>Yields of tax-exempt funds were down sharply for the week ended yesterday. Assets increased $16 billion, to $77 billion. The average seven-day compounded yield fell 12 basis points, to 5.37 percent, while the 30-day yield fell 8 basis points, to 5.51 percent. For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, the equivalent taxable 7-day compounded yield would be 7.45 percent; it would be 8.01 percent for investors in a 33 percent bracket.</p>
        <p>Spartan Pennsylvania Municipal Money Market Portfolio, distributed by the Fidelity Distributors Corporation, Boston, has been the best-performing fund for last couple of months. The return this past week was 5.95 percent, down 21 basis points from the top yield last week. The Spartan yield is about 58 basis points higher than the seven-day average, but the spread continues to narrow.</p>
