        <p>LEAD: Demonstrators halted traffic in much of the capital today to protest what appeared to be the victory of the heirs to the long-ruling Communists in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years.</p>
        <p>Demonstrators halted traffic in much of the capital today to protest what appeared to be the victory of the heirs to the long-ruling Communists in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years.</p>
        <p>The protesters formed barricades with benches, blocking traffic on main thoroughfares, including an intersection that demonstrators blocked for several hours on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the 16-party opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces, and of an anarchist group say the elections on Sunday were manipulated, but most foreign observers said they saw little or no wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>With half the official results tallied, the Socialists appeared to have won the first round of voting on Sunday, an election official said. Runoffs are to be held next Sunday in 81 constituencies where no single candidate received the required majority.</p>
        <p>The opposition pledged Tuesday to rally behind candidates not associated with the Socialist Party in the runoffs in a last-ditch effort to gain control of Parliament.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that based on the known results and projections by West German and Bulgarian groups, it was still possible that the opposition could gain a slight edge after the second-round voting. But the official B.T.A. press agency said the opposition would have to win nearly all the seats at stake in the runoffs.</p>
        <p>Half of Parliament's 400 seats are being filled by direct election and the other 200 based on the percentage of votes each party receives.</p>
        <p>Final results for the individual constituencies made public by the Central Election Commission today showed the Socialist Party won 75 seats outright in the first round.</p>
        <p>Candidates of the Union of Democratic Forces won in 32 constituences and the mostly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms won in 9, the state radio reported.</p>
