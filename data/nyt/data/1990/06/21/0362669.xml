        <p>LEAD: Stuart Marshall's feature-length documentary, ''Desire: Sexuality in Germany 1910-1945,'' leaves a lot of material unexplored, but it is still a fascinating introduction to a huge subject.</p>
        <p>Stuart Marshall's feature-length documentary, ''Desire: Sexuality in Germany 1910-1945,'' leaves a lot of material unexplored, but it is still a fascinating introduction to a huge subject.</p>
        <p>The film opens today at Anthology Film Archives on a bill with Gregg Araki's fiction feature ''The Long Weekend (O' Despair).''</p>
        <p>In interviews with historians and with survivors of Third Reich persecution, ''Desire'' traces the origins of modern gay liberation to the rise in Germany of various back-to-nature movements in the early years of this century.</p>
        <p>The movements exalted, among other things, body culture, gymnastics and sun-worshipping by sexually segregated groups of young people. There were so-called dance farms for women, while men gathered together to hike, work on the farm and get in touch with their bodies in other healthy ways.</p>
        <p>According to the testimony of Mr. Marshall's historians, the back-to-nature movments were at first a reaction against the industrialization of Germany. The same-sex friendships they promoted, including the love between a teacher and a student (called pedagogical eros), were seen as being pure. Sex initially had nothing to do with them, though sex was always the unspoken subtext.</p>
        <p>The movie devotes most of its running time to the testimony of homosexual men and women who remember their lives in Germany in the late 1920's, the 1930's and the 1940's. Their individual stories are immensely moving for being so particular.</p>
        <p>''The Long Weekend'' is something very different, a garrulous, overwritten fiction film about a weekend in Los Angeles shared by six aimless, post-college young people. Mr. Araki's greatest accomplishment was making the film on a budget of approximately $5,000. His artistic talents, however, don't match his film-making ingenuity.</p>
        <p>The weekend's host is Michael, who is first seen throwing away a copy of Andre Bazin's ''What Is Cinema?'' He once was a film maker but now does nothing but contemplate his boredom. Joining him for three tiresome days are his male lover, a pair of lesbian lovers and a heterosexual couple. Before the weekend is over, the relationships have shifted around somewhat.</p>
        <p>''The Long Weekend'' has an attractively grainy black-and-white look, but the movie is very difficult to watch. Mr. Araki's actors pose a lot and talk extremely self-conscious, neo-sitcom dialogue. ''This is like bad 'Partridge Family' reruns,'' says one. Another says, ''I want you to break up with me because I'm too immature to do it myself.''</p>
        <p>Or consider, ''I've been feeling this weird complacency recently. I have no past, no future.'' To which the other replies, ''We're all going mad.''</p>
        <p>Only in Los Angeles, where the movie was made, could this be described as minimalist, which is the word used in the press kit.</p>
