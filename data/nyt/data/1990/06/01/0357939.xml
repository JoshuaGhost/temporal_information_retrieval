        <p>LEAD: Former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican running for governor as an independent, said today that he had selected a Hartford politician and lawyer, Eunice S. Groark, who is largely unknown in the rest of the state, to be his running mate for the office of lieutenant governor.</p>
        <p>Former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican running for governor as an independent, said today that he had selected a Hartford politician and lawyer, Eunice S. Groark, who is largely unknown in the rest of the state, to be his running mate for the office of lieutenant governor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Groark, a 52-year-old descendant of one of Hartford's founding families, is a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for mayor here in 1985 after two terms on the City Council. She currently is the Corporation Counsel for the city and has never run for state office.</p>
        <p>Politicians said that in placing Mrs. Groark on the ticket of his Connecticut Party, Mr. Weicker had a running mate much like himself: a Republican who has managed to attract votes from Democrats.</p>
        <p>Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state by more than 200,000 out of a total registration of about 1.8 million voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weicker announced his decision at a news conference in the State Capitol.</p>
