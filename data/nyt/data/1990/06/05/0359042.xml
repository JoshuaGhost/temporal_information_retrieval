        <p>An administrator called in to rescue the financial services group British and Commonwealth Holdings P.L.C. said he would try to prevent the company from becoming one of Britain's largest corporate failures. B.&amp; C., a former shipping company that is laboring under $:1.3 billion or $2.2 billion in debt, is the largest British company to go into administration, a type of receivership introduced in Britain in 1986. Its problems stem from its 1988 takeover of the computer leasing company Atlantic Computers P.L.C.</p>
        <p>The B.&amp; C. board was forced to call in administrators this weekend after three leading creditor banks refused to back rescue attempts put together by B.&amp; C. advisers.</p>
