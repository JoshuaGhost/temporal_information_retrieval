        <p>LEAD: Kurt Masur, the East German conductor who is to become the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1992, has returned to conducting after two weeks of observation at a heart clinic in West Germany.</p>
        <p>Kurt Masur, the East German conductor who is to become the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1992, has returned to conducting after two weeks of observation at a heart clinic in West Germany.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur was released from the clinic last Tuesday. On Thursday and Friday, he led the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, of which he is music director, in programs that included a new Siegfried Matthus work and the Bruckner Third Symphony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur was hospitalized at the Kerckhoff Clinic in Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt, on May 14, after complaining of chest pains during a flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt that evening. The 62-year-old conductor's manager, Judie Janowski of Columbia Artists Management in New York, said his physicians concluded that Mr. Masur's discomfort was from high blood pressure, for which he was on medication, as well as exhaustion and circulatory problems.</p>
        <p>Albert K. Webster, the managing director of the New York Philharmonic, said that he saw Mr. Masur both at the clinic and after his release. ''He did not strike me as a man who is ill,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Masur plans to take the Gewandhaus Orchestra on a 12-concert European tour, which begins on Thursday and runs through June 21.</p>
