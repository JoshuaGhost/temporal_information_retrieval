        <p>A man threatened to jump off the Driscoll Bridge over the Raritan River on the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge last night as hundreds of commuters tried to return from weekends at the New Jersey Shore. The State Police shut down the northbound lanes of the parkway, backing up traffic for nine miles, a parkway official said.</p>
        <p>The police said that the man, who climbed onto the outer railing of the bridge at 9:15 P.M., was looking for attention and knew that Sunday was a busy night for traffic. After bringing in a psychologist and the man's wife, the police were able to persuade him to return to safety at 12:10 A.M. His name was not released.</p>
        <p>The Driscoll Bridge is north of Exit 125 on the parkway and traffic was backed up, at one point, to Exit 116.</p>
        <p>A State Police spokesman in Holmdel said the man was taken to Perth Amboy Hospital for evaluation. The spokesman said they were not sure what he would be charged with.</p>
