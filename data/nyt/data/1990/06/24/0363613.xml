        <p>LEAD: To the Editor: The pickpocket always seems to be with us, but my husband and I solved this problem long ago with a petticoat with ''his'' and ''hers'' pockets.</p>
        <p>To the Editor: The pickpocket always seems to be with us, but my husband and I solved this problem long ago with a petticoat with ''his'' and ''hers'' pockets.</p>
        <p>The petticoat is made of a drip-dry material with elastic at the top and the hem ending just above the knees. The pockets are of a size to hold return air tickets, one passport, credit cards, traveler's checks, some cash, change for restrooms and a lipstick. The pockets are placed over the side seams at the hem line, and there is a heavy snap at the top of each pocket.</p>
        <p>Because the pockets are above the knees and at the sides, they do not bang the legs when walking, and because they are low down they do not bulge under a skirt. When ''loaded,'' the petticoat is heavy in the hand, but when worn one is absolutely unconscious of it, for it is so well balanced.</p>
        <p>Access to the pockets is easily engineered with a shielding husband or friend or a what-the-heck disregard for modesty. My husband would carry enough cash for one day, with one credit card, in a wallet in the inside pocket of his jacket, which was secured with a strong safety pin. I didnot carry a purse, not wanting to have my arm broken for makeup.</p>
        <p>It probably sounds as though we were always running scared, but we have seen too many women with their arms in slings and heard the wails of other travelers scrambling to replace passports and traveler's checks. We are able to forget such hazards and completely enjoy ourselves.</p>
