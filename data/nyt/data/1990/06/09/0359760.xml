        <p>LEAD: In a rematch of the German Open final that Monica Seles won last month, top-seeded Steffi Graf will be matched against the 16-year-old from Yugoslavia in the French Open women's singles final Saturday.</p>
        <p>In a rematch of the German Open final that Monica Seles won last month, top-seeded Steffi Graf will be matched against the 16-year-old from Yugoslavia in the French Open women's singles final Saturday.</p>
        <p>This year a more stylish Graf blazed through the draw here in her white headband and pearl-drop earrings without dropping a set. Graf, a two-time French Open champion who has lost only to Seles this year, has won eight of the last nine Grand Slam tournaments. Graf said she has a more positive attitude and is playing better now than she did in January when she won the Australian Open.</p>
        <p>The only blemish to her Grand Slam record came here last year when Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain upset her in a three-set final that followed a surprising semifinal in which Seles took a set from Graf.</p>
        <p>Seles enters the final with the best record of any woman this year: she is 33-3 and has won 31 consecutive matches, a streak that includes victories against Graf and Martina Navratilova. In career meetings, however, Graf wields a 3-1 advantage over Seles.</p>
