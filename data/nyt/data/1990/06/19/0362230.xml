        <p>LEAD: The Great Western Financial Corporation, parent company of the Great Western Bank, said today that it had agreed to acquire 13 branches and $700 million in deposits from Carteret Savings Bank in Florida.</p>
        <p>The Great Western Financial Corporation, parent company of the Great Western Bank, said today that it had agreed to acquire 13 branches and $700 million in deposits from Carteret Savings Bank in Florida.</p>
        <p>Great Western, a savings and loan association based in Beverly Hills, Calif., will pay a premium of $26.5 million for the deposits. That means Great Western will assume Carteret's $700 million in deposits, which are counted as liabilities, but will receive a check for only $673.5 million. Carteret said it would also receive $8.4 million for the offices.</p>
        <p>The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, will increase Great Western's Florida deposits to $2.4 billion and give it more than 60 retail branches in the state.</p>
        <p>Carteret, a New Jersey savings and loan company owned by the Ambase Corporation, will retain 10 Florida branches.</p>
        <p>It said it had chosen to sell 13 branches to focus more on its core New Jersey operations.</p>
        <p>While Carteret said it exceeded all regulatory capital requirements, the company noted the transaction would bolster its capital position.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Carteret needed to raise capital because of problems in the commercial real estate market in New Jersey and other Middle Atlantic States.</p>
