Mr. Noyce, who died earlier this month, said in an interview last year that he believed the trend would continue, and probably accelerate, in the last decade of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, the co-founders of the Intel Corporation, discovered that computer power seemed to evolve so that about every 18 months, the number of transistors that could be placed in an integrated circuit doubled. Mr. Noyce, who died earlier this month, said in an interview last year that he believed the trend would continue, and probably accelerate, in the last decade of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Today, at the annual PC Expo computer show in New York, produced by H. A. Bruno Inc., the Intel Corporation opened a display called Micro 2000, which describes what microchips will be like if the projections of Mr. Moore and Mr. Noyce hold true until the year 2000. Historically, predictions in the computer industry have almost always turned out to be too conservative.</p>
        <p>In the Intel vision, the Micro 2000 chip will have these features:</p>
        <p>One hundred million transistors on a one-inch square die. A transistor, in the digital world, is essentially a switch that turns on or off, like a light switch. Along with resistors, capacitors and diodes, the transistor is a basic building block of an integrated circuit, or chip. When Mr. Noyce invented the integrated circuit in the late 1950's, a single transistor took up almost as much space as 100 million transistors will in the Micro 2000 chip.</p>
        <p>The typical Intel 80386 chip used today has roughly 500,000 transistors, and a 386-based PC that costs roughly $5,000 now equals the processing power of minicomputers that cost $250,000 in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>One of the benefits of packing transistors and other components closer together is speed, since the electrons that move through the chip don't have to travel as far. Even at the speed of electrons, smaller is faster.</p>
        <p>Laboratory researchers have already demonstrated the feasibility of making chips with features as small as one-tenth of a micron (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). As an indicator of where the technology is going, researchers at the International Business Machines Corporation recently manipulated individual atoms to spell out ''IBM,'' using the atoms as if they were dots on a dot-matrix printer. At such levels, the physical bulk of the electron becomes an impediment.</p>
        <p>The chip would have a speed of 250 megahertz. Computer chips are often referred to as fast or slow. The speed is gauged by the chip's clock cycle, in effect the rate of the ''pulse'' or heartbeat of the chip. The pulse is determined by a number of factors, including power consumption, packaging and the size and length of the connections within the chip. The original I.B.M. PC operated at 4.77 megahertz, and today's chips typically operate at speeds of 12 megahertz to 40 megahertz. A hurdle with faster chips is the interference that they can cause with nearby radios and televisions, so proper shielding will be critical.</p>
        <p>The future chip would handle two billion instructions per second. This is not a typographical error. Given the density of transistors and the high clock speed, a single central processing unit will be able to execute about 700 million instructions, like add, subtract or multiply, each second. However, an important trend in computing today is to harness several processors together to operate on a task, which is called parallel processing. The next logical step in parallel processing is to place several processors on the same die. Intel envisions Micro 2000 as having as many as four such CPU's integrated on a single chip, yielding the two billion instructions per second.</p>
        <p>Another feature would be fewer clocks per instruction. In today's chips, it takes several ''clocks,'' or pulse beats, to execute one instruction. In Micro 2000, in contrast, several instructions will be performed in each clock. Intel officials say they expect that Micro 2000 will handle three to five instructions per clock.</p>
        <p>The chip would also be compatible with today's computer software. Basically, Intel plans to build the equivalent of today's 80486 microprocessor into a tiny corner of the Micro 2000 chip, just as the shrunken equivalent of the original 8086 chip is given a tiny corner of the 80486. Doing so means that software written to take advantage of the older chips will always find a home in the new chips. So what does this mean to the average user?  ''With all this increase in performance, not just by the year 2000 but even in the next three to five years, computers are going to get easier to use,'' said David House, president of Intel's microcomputer components group.</p>
        <p>''With the machines today, because of their relatively limited power, people are forced to use computers on the computer's terms,'' Mr. House said. These computers ''think'' in rigid, logical steps, while humans are much more intuitive and able to make leaps of association.</p>
        <p>The Micro 2000 will have the power to adapt to the way people work, rather than the reverse, Mr. House said. It will be capable of running software that employs artificial intelligence, common-sense knowledge bases and improved ''human interfaces,'' perhaps ones that recognize spoken commands and gestures.</p>
