        <p>LEAD: Leaders of the nation's largest anti-abortion organization played down recent setbacks this weekend as they prepared themselves for state-by-state trench warfare that they said could last 10 to 20 years.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the nation's largest anti-abortion organization played down recent setbacks this weekend as they prepared themselves for state-by-state trench warfare that they said could last 10 to 20 years.</p>
        <p>As the National Right to Life Committee concluded its three-day annual convention here, its president, Dr. J. C. Willke, blamed what he said were skewed public opinion polls, a biased press and fainthearted ''turncoat'' politicians for a perception that the tide had turned against his movement.</p>
        <p>''We are not downcast,'' he said in an interview. ''This is buoyancy. This is optimism. This is looking ahead. You would not be able to tell here that we had suffered any reverses.''</p>
        <p>The exhibit hall at the convention had video screens portraying the development of a fetus and posters bearing slogans like ''Hush little baby, don't say a word - ever.''</p>
        <p>Bumper Stickers and Videotapes</p>
        <p>Delegates shopped for buttons, bumper stickers and pamphlets, raising their voices to be heard above the squalling of a baby on one continuously playing video soundtrack and the voice of a young woman on another speaking sadly of ''my brother, who died a violent death by abortion 13 years ago.''</p>
        <p>The slogans and the tactics of the National Right to Life Committee have not changed in the year since the Supreme Court gave the states more power to regulate abortion, Dr. Willke said. The ultimate goal remains the outlawing of abortion nationwide. Avoiding the blockades of abortion clinics and other direct tactics of groups like Operation Rescue, the organization concentrates on lobbying, legislation and political action.</p>
        <p>But it has been forced to take a pragmatic aproach, Dr. Willke said, tailoring its immediate goals to the political realities of individual states. ''We'll protect as many babies as we can and come back for more later,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Countering Media Distortions</p>
        <p>Susan Smith, the committee's associate legislative director, said, ''Ten, 20 years down the road I expect we'll be a little farther along than we are now.'' At the moment, she conceded, they were working uphill to counter an false image that ''the press aids and facilitates, that it is politically safer to be pro-abortion.''</p>
        <p>Committee leaders ofsaid the tide had in fact been running in their favor, speaking of recent primary-election victories in California, Pennsylvania and Idaho and of the initial success of a bill in Louisiana to outlaw most abortions.</p>
        <p>Richard E. Ryan, senior vice president of the Texas-based polling company Tarrance &amp; Associates, questioned public opinion surveys that he said had frightened some politicians away from an anti-abortion stand.</p>
        <p>Although about 60 percent of those surveyed tends to favor allowing abortion, he said, 50 to 60 percent also tends to favor placing controls on abortions, he said.''The mushy middle: that's what we are all fighting for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some Diversity Among Delegates</p>
        <p>In this fight, which he said might continue for the next 20 years, Mr. Ryan said the anti-abortion forces had the advantage of better grass-roots organization. The National Right to Life Committee has 3,000 chapters in all 50 states.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said the 900 or so delegates gathered at the Radisson Hotel this weekend represented ''the heart of America; They are not the intelligentsia.''</p>
        <p>Visual Aids, Bloody or Cuddly</p>
        <p>Sylvia Torres, who was selling videotapes at a booth sponsored by American Portrait Films International, said people sometimes need to be shocked into seeing the truth.</p>
        <p>She said she had been a counselor at an abortion clinic until the day she actually witnessed an abortion. ''That's how I learned,'' she said. ''It took a visual aid for me.''</p>
        <p>But Kit Eridor, who was selling anti-abortion souvenirs to raise money for the Bowling Green, Ohio, branch of National Right to Life, said some people do not react well to ''pictures of bloody babies and things like that.''</p>
        <p>''We've got items that are soft in nature,'' he said. ''Fuzzy teddy bears; children love teddy bears. We are saying, 'Choose life.' We are saying it in a soft way.''</p>
        <p>The Next Generation of Soldiers</p>
        <p>As the convention came to a close on Saturday, the people who expect to be leading the battle 10 to 20 years from now - the delegates to the Teens for Life special session - were gathered around the swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Fourteen-year-old Sarah Macias of Merced, Calif., said: ''We were talking about how to handle the different points the pro-abortion side will bring up. We have to remember that that person could be the baby you are trying to save and to treat them in a loving way even though they are angry at you.''</p>
