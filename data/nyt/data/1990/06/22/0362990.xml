        <p>LEAD: Geneva Valladares calmly brushed her daughter's hair, but her voice was coated with excitement because soon, she said, ''Nelson Mandela will actually be in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Geneva Valladares calmly brushed her daughter's hair, but her voice was coated with excitement because soon, she said, ''Nelson Mandela will actually be in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>''He reminds me of Martin Luther King,'' Mrs. Valladares said of Mr. Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid leader. ''He fought for his people. And he's not going to give up now. He's a survivor, just like I am.''</p>
        <p>Harlem is also a survivor. For generations the community was known as the Capital of Black America, a mecca for artists, entertainers and political leaders from Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X to New York City's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>But Harlem has fallen on hard times, or been pushed by governmental and political neglect, many people on its streets contend. Poverty, drugs, unemployment, inferior schools and poor health are part of Harlem's daily life.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, all along Harlem's avenues and boulevards named after black American heroes, posters of Mr. Mandela were displayed in shop windows like flags on Memorial Day. Mr. Mandela's visit to Harlem was a dose of pride and inspiration and for many a rallying cry ''to clean up our own backyard,'' Mrs. Valladares said.</p>
        <p>''I hope he will open some people's eyes,'' she said. ''We need to do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Valladares talked, her 9-year-old daughter, Alaya, tugged at her sleeve.</p>
        <p>''Mom, why did he go to jail?'' Alaya asked. ''For fighting for his people.'' ''Is he black?'' ''Yeah. African.'' ''Is he going back to jail?''</p>
        <p>''I hope not,' the mother said. ''He was an innocent man. He just wants some justice for his people. That's what we want right here in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>'We Need Help Ourselves'</p>
        <p>Frank James, 61, a laundry worker, sympathized with Mr. Mandela's struggle but was skeptical of the support that Harlem could provide.</p>
        <p>''Sure we sympathize with his cause,'' Mr. James said. ''But that's about all we can do. We need help ourselves in this prejudiced country, America, my home.''</p>
        <p>Phyllis Tripp left her Brooklyn apartment early yesterday with her two daughters and headed for Harlem to wait for ''just a glimpse'' of Mr. Mandela. ''He's been like a myth the whole 27 years he was in prison,'' she said. ''We didn't known what he looked liked. He's like something that came out of a fairy tale book.''</p>
        <p>It was 11 A.M., about seven hours before Mr. Mandela was scheduled to speak at a rally at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevards, also known as African Square. Mrs. Tripp and her children had already been waiting for two hours.</p>
        <p>''As an African-American woman,'' she said, ''I have been confronted by racism plenty of times right here in New York City. Our struggle is the same.''</p>
        <p>John Simpson, 42, a street vendor who ''sells everything in general and nothing in particular,'' refused to be caught in the Mandela excitement.</p>
        <p>''The people love the man because he struggled and because he's one of us,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''But Mandela has no business trying to negotiate with the South African government. It's like playing three card monte. You're going to lose because it's a crooked game. There should be no negotiating about freedom.''</p>
        <p>But the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie said he was thoroughly excited about Mr. Mandela's visit to Harlem.</p>
        <p>''It's going to give the people hope,'' he said, standing in a light rain in front of Sylvia's Restaurant, on Lenox Avenue near 126th Street. ''We haven't got much hope from anywhere else.'' ''</p>
        <p>In the glow from the marquee of the Apollo Theater Wednesday night, Neville Bird was doing a brisk business selling several different kinds of T-shirts of Mr. Mandela.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bird said he also sells a lot of T-shirts of Malcolm X, or of a man holding a boy's hand. The inscription on the shirt reads: ''What Our Young Males Need Most Today Are Strong, Positive And Courageous Role Models. Be One.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. Mandela,'' Mr. Bird said, ''fits that description very well.''</p>
