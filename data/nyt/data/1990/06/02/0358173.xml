        <p>LEAD: The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that a survey of its members indicated that the nation's manufacturing economy grew in May to the highest level since January 1989. The group said stronger production, a continued high level of new orders and brisker deliveries fueled the growth.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that a survey of its members indicated that the nation's manufacturing economy grew in May to the highest level since January 1989. The group said stronger production, a continued high level of new orders and brisker deliveries fueled the growth.</p>
        <p>The association said its index of economic activity rose to 50.7 percent in May, up from 50.2 percent in April. That was the previous highest level since January 1989.</p>
        <p>But economists cautioned that the figures for the various indexes included in the purchasing managers' report do not reflect dramatic improvement in the economy. They said the figures, which provided a contrast to lackluster Government figures on factory orders on Thursday and on employment yesterday, represented slight improvement from what had been a weakened manufacturing economy for much of the last year.</p>
        <p>Second Month of Gains</p>
        <p>''The numbers are better, but they still point to a sluggish economy,'' said Wayne C. Stevens, chief economist with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. ''After all, many of the numbers are just above the 50 percent mark, rather than in the 60 percent range. Also, it should be remembered that these figures tend to be more reflective of what's going to be happening than what's happening at this moment.''</p>
        <p>The results represented the second consecutive month of increasing manufacturing activity after 11 months of decline. A reading below 50 percent indicates that the economy's manufacturing sector is declining, while a reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion. A reading below 44 percent indicates a decline in real gross national product.</p>
        <p>The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because managers from a range of industrial companies throughout the country are surveyed.</p>
        <p>'Not a Bad Economy'</p>
        <p>Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., said the May figures indicated inflation was slowing and the economy was beginning to move beyond the sluggishness of recent months.</p>
        <p>''Manufacturing went through 11 months of decline, and we tended to bottom out and stabilize,'' Mr. Bretz said. ''For the last two months we've seen modest growth. It's not a bad economy, considering we are in the eighth year of expansion.''</p>
        <p>The strongest gain was in production. The production index rose to 56.3 in May from 53 percent in April. The May level was the highest since January 1989. Mr. Bretz said the increase in production reflected a large increase in new orders in April. The new orders index jumped to 55.5 percent in April from 50.4 in March. The index slipped slightly in May, to 54.8 percent.</p>
        <p>The index for new orders for export stood at 54 percent in May, down sharply from 60.5 in April.</p>
        <p>Inventory Levels Fall</p>
        <p>The report indicated that the level of inventories fell to the lowest point since January 1983. The inventory index dropped to 37.8 percent in May from 41.6 percent in April. ''That indicates that the modest growth we see in the manufacturing economy has nothing to do with inventory building,'' Mr. Bretz said. ''There is no real inventory overhang, which is a positive sign for the economy.''</p>
        <p>Eight items were reported to be in short supply. They included bearings, electric motors, silicon wafers, soda ash, timber and lemon juice. Also in short supply were hydrogen peroxide and titanium dioxide, because paper makers are switching from the use of chlorine to avoid dioxins.</p>
