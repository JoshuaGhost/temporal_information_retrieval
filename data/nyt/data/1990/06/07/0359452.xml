        <p>LEAD: The New York City Transit Authority said yesterday that starting on Monday token sellers would not enforce a longstanding ban on open baby carriages in the subway.</p>
        <p>The New York City Transit Authority said yesterday that starting on Monday token sellers would not enforce a longstanding ban on open baby carriages in the subway.</p>
        <p>The decision is a victory for hundreds of people who have recently complained that token clerks were refusing to open fare gates for people with strollers.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the authority, Jared Lebow, said its president, Alan F. Kiepper, told the City Council Budget Committee yesterday that the ban had failed because people were lifting their strollers over turnstiles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lebow said that token sellers were being instructed to open electronic gates for people with strollers and that Mr. Kiepper was planning a campaign to publicize safety precautions for riders with strollers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lebow cited two incidents in which babies were almost injured when their strollers rolled off subway platforms. In March, a parent left a stroller with a 1-year-old unattended on an IND platform and the baby's brother pushed the stroller onto the tracks. A bystander lifted the baby off the tracks just before a train entered the station.</p>
        <p>Last year, a mother turned her back on a stroller at an el station in Queens and the wind blew the carriage with a 6-week-old onto the tracks. He fell from the stroller through the ties to the street, suffering minor injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lebow said, ''Mr. Kiepper, who is a father of four, understands the importance of strollers to parents.''</p>
