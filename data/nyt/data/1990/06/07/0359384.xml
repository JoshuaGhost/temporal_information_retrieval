        <p>LEAD: Americans gave $114.7 billion last year in philanthropic gifts, an increase over last year, but fund-raisers remain worried about the continuing adverse impact of 1986 tax laws.</p>
        <p>Americans gave $114.7 billion last year in philanthropic gifts, an increase over last year, but fund-raisers remain worried about the continuing adverse impact of 1986 tax laws.</p>
        <p>Most of the gains came from an 11.7 percent increase in giving by individuals who provided $96.43 billion that went mainly to religious groups.</p>
        <p>Giving by foundations and corporations also increased but at a much lower rate, to $6.7 billion and $5 billion, respectively, up from $6.15 billion and $4.8 billion.</p>
        <p>The total combined giving by individuals, corporations and foundations in 1989 was 10.4 percent over the previous year, or 5.5 percent when adjusted for inflation, according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, whose Trust for Philanthropy issued its annual estimates of giving on Monday.</p>
        <p>But fund-raisers were worried that giving to certain areas declined, or barely held its own. For example, giving to education dropped slightly, and gifts to health institutions increased almost imperceptibly. And while donations to arts, culture and the humanities increased 5.4 percent, when adjusted for inflation, gifts to museums did not meet hopes.</p>
        <p>''I don't know where that increase is going because it certainly is not coming into the museum community,'' said Edward H. Able, executive director of the American Association of Museums, a Washington-based organization representing 2,500 museums.</p>
        <p>Problem for Museums</p>
        <p>A large measure of museums' financial troubles, Mr. Able maintained, were traceable to the 1986 tax changes, which scaled down incentives to give and particularly reduced the benefits of donating property that had appreciated in value. ''As a consequence,'' he said, ''museums anticipating gifts are seeing potential donors selling their art works, which are going to Japanese and other foreign collectors, and America's cultural patrimony is hemorrhaging.''</p>
        <p>The estimates of giving are developed by the association, which represents 32 leading groups engaged in raising money for universities, hospitals and other nonprofit organizations.</p>
        <p>Optimism Is Questioned</p>
        <p>Some analysts questioned this year's optimistic report, called Giving U.S.A. They pointed out that United Way, whose fund raising is regarded as a reliable barometer of giving by individuals, reported an increase in 1989 of only 7.2 percent over 1988.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising association concluded that most of the 1989 increase came from a surge in gifts by individuals who contributed more than 84 percent of all giving from private sources.</p>
        <p>The growth was attributed to the jump in personal income of almost 9 percent, a 21 percent rise in the prices of stock and also growing public awareness of causes like homelessness, AIDS and the environment. Also, a number of universities benefited from intensive fund-raising campaigns.</p>
        <p>''Charities, and especially social service organizations, are increasingly aware they cannot depend on government support for their operating budgets or for expansion to meet the growing needs of clients,'' said Jimmie R. Alford, chairman of the association's Trust for Philanthropy.</p>
        <p>Giving in the religious sector totaled $54.3 billion, a 12.9 increase over 1988. Education received $10.69 billion and health, $10 billion. Arts, culture and the humanities together received $7.4 billion. Social action organizations, like environmental or women's groups, received $3.6 billion and a catch-all category including foreign aid received $17.1 billion.</p>
        <p>The increase in corporate giving was surprising to some fund-raisers who expected the total to drop in the wake of threatened takeovers.</p>
        <p>''Despite all the wolf-crying from charities, corporate contributions have proved remarkably resiliant,'' said Anne Klepper, director of the Contributions Management Institute of the Conference Board, an organization of 2,500 corporate members. ''Corporations are still very much in business and entering the 90's with even higher hopes. Who knows what will happen on the international scene, in Eastern Europe or the Pacific rim?''</p>
