        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Despite ''After the Mills Balloons Float Away'' (editorial, May 28) and the same day's letter from Mary S. Hartman, a dean at Rutgers University (''The Worth of Women's Colleges''), the decision of the trustees of Mills College in Oakland, Calif., to bow to student and faculty pressure to keep that institution women-only is in error. As the son of a rabid feminist, and long a supporter of feminist causes, including pro-choice and equal pay, I give this opinion with a clear understanding of the issues.</p>
        <p>While you can argue that ''women educated in single-sex colleges go on to better jobs than their coeducated counterparts,'' this does not justify excluding men. If an institution provides a good educational setting and opportunities, it should provide them to all applicants; to do otherwise is reverse sexual discrimination. In addition, arguing that students and faculty members ''also feared that men would usurp leadership roles on campus'' and ''dominate classroom dynamics'' (news article, May 19) shows a fear of male dominance that, justified or not, is not acceptable in an educational setting.</p>
        <p>Finally, when male-only clubs and institutions are justifiably coming under legal attack for ''sexist'' discrimination and are being forced to admit women, the decision to keep Mills College women-only smacks of a feminist double standard.</p>
        <p>On ethical and legal grounds, the decision to keep Mills College women-only sets a bad precedent and furthermore, would not, if challenged, hold up in court.</p>
