        <p>LEAD: Weird things are happening down at the law firm of Recusal, Entrapment &amp; Fluttering, formerly known as the U.S. Department of Justice. Some suspect it is a plot by the current Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, to make Ed Meese look good by comparison.</p>
        <p>Weird things are happening down at the law firm of Recusal, Entrapment &amp; Fluttering, formerly known as the U.S. Department of Justice. Some suspect it is a plot by the current Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, to make Ed Meese look good by comparison.</p>
        <p>After excoriation in this space for failure to seek a special prosecutor in a cocaine case involving his longtime closest aide, the A.G. gutsily had me in to lunch.</p>
        <p>I raised the case of Henry Barr, his close aide for 20 years, who quit last year just after an ex-associate was made a target of a grand jury inquiry in Harrisburg, Pa. As soon as that target began pointing upward, shouldn't the A.G. have launched a preliminary investigation under the Ethics in Government Act?</p>
        <p>''At my very first contact, my response was to recuse myself completely,'' said Mr. Thornburgh, using the legal verb for withdrawal. ''For me to include myself in the process in any way would have been improper. To see some sinister implication in that is unthinkable to me.''</p>
        <p>I said he could start a basketball team with all the top officials who have recused themselves in this case: himself, his former chief of staff, his former press secretary, his key assistant, even the new U.S. Attorney on the scene. ''It's in the hands of Ed Dennis, chief of the Criminal Division,'' Mr. Thornburgh said confidently.</p>
        <p>When I pointed out that Mr. Dennis, too, had recused himself, he gulped, said that was news to him, but that the next man down the line, Jack Keeney, was highly capable.</p>
        <p>Never in the history of the department have there been so many recusals in one case. Mr. Keeney, a 39-year veteran at Justice, tells me that Mr. Thornburgh could have recused himself under a provision in the Ethics in Government Act that would have simultaneously triggered the special prosecutor process, but ''that's discretionary, not mandatory. He chose not to do so. He chose the usual recusal route.''</p>
        <p>In the method he selected to bow out of the case involving his right-hand man, the Attorney General kept the case close to home and away from a court-appointed prosecutor. But no administration should be the investigator in a case that has so many high-level internal connections at Justice.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest that the probe into the possible use of cocaine within Mr. Thornburgh's inner circle is being unlawfully thwarted; Mr. Keeney is a straight shooter.</p>
        <p>But I do charge that a double standard of prosecutorial discretion is evident in the use of a sexual lure to ''get'' Mayor Marion Barry on cocaine charges - compared with the urge to run for the hills en masse in a narcotics case involving other public officials.</p>
        <p>The Attorney General acknowledges that he was informed of the Barry ''sting'' beforehand: ''Nothing has come to my attention that anything improper was done in this case, and I expect that view to be ratified by the court.''</p>
        <p>Having sent his signal of approval to U.S. Attorneys around the country that former girlfriends may be used as bait to entrap bad role models who may be inclined to use crack, Mr. Thornburgh hangs equally tough on the investigative methods used in a vast leak-hunt.</p>
        <p>Ten top officials at Justice were subjected to polygraph tests by this year's plumbers. The leaker of a scurrilous charge against a Member of Congress was not found, but a couple of high aides caused spikes on the graph, modified their stories, and were transferred.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, as recently revealed by David Johnston of The New York Times, one of the 10 tested was Mr. Thornburgh. Is he proud of having been the first Attorney General to be ''fluttered''?</p>
        <p>''I considered the impact of refusal to do so,'' the former Governor replies. What if the machine - which Jack Keeney says is useful but not infallible - had registered reactions that suggested he was lying? ''I knew I wasn't going to flunk it,'' says the A.G.</p>
        <p>Was he not troubled by the precedent? ''Not a precedent; just a choice I made.'' Only a hypothetical question, but if an investigator suspected the President to be the leaker, would he be hooked up to the machine to see if he sweats? ''That would be the President's choice.''</p>
        <p>Something is very wrong in this value system. Mass recusal is no substitute for independent counsel to investigate drug use in the A.G.'s office; sleazy sex lures to bugged hotel rooms do not belong in the arsenal of the law; and half-accurate ''lie detectors'' should not threaten the stability of our Government.</p>
        <p>Dick Thornburgh, by becoming accessible to staff and press, has taken a step toward image redemption; philosophically, he has a long, long way to go.</p>
