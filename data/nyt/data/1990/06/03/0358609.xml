        <p>LEAD: A Queens man on parole was shot and killed by police yesterday in South Ozone Park after he pointed a gun at four officers who had been chasing him, the police said.</p>
        <p>A Queens man on parole was shot and killed by police yesterday in South Ozone Park after he pointed a gun at four officers who had been chasing him, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man was identified as James Joseph Bradley, 26 years old, of 123-65 147th Street in South Ozone Park, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward Burns.</p>
        <p>The incident began at about 4:20 P.M. when two 106th Precinct officers ordered a car to pull over at 135th Place and Rockaway Boulevard.</p>
        <p>As the officers approached, Mr. Bradley got out and ran. The officers saw a gun in in his waistband, called for help, and chased him.</p>
        <p>Two other patrol cars spotted the man about a block away. As he ran with four officers chasing him, a gun fell from his waist band, Sergeant Burns said.</p>
        <p>''The officers told him to halt,'' he said. ''He then picked up the gun and pointed at the officers. The officers told him to to drop it again, and when he pointed it at them again, they shot him.''</p>
        <p>Twelve shots were fired. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The police recovered a .38-caliber revolver.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. Bradley pleaded guilty to robbery and to selling narcotics, and his parole was due to end in October.</p>
