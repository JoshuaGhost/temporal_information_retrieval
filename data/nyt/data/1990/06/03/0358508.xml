        <p>LEAD: The scenario goes something like this: Barreling down the highway in your new touring machine, you and your family and your pet sheepdog, Bosco, could not be happier. Suddenly, in the middle of the 200th refrain of ''Row, Row, Row Your Boat,'' your good cheer is broken by the wail of a siren. It's a state trooper, who pulls you off the highway for traveling too fast in a 55-mile-an-hour zone, directs you to follow him 15 miles down a country road, and deposits you in a sweltering, one-room courthouse where you wait all day for a justice of the peace to hear your case.</p>

        <p>The scenario goes something like this: Barreling down the highway in your new touring machine, you and your family and your pet sheepdog, Bosco, could not be happier. Suddenly, in the middle of the 200th refrain of ''Row, Row, Row Your Boat,'' your good cheer is broken by the wail of a siren. It's a state trooper, who pulls you off the highway for traveling too fast in a 55-mile-an-hour zone, directs you to follow him 15 miles down a country road, and deposits you in a sweltering, one-room courthouse where you wait all day for a justice of the peace to hear your case.</p>
        <p>Think it can't happen to you? Think again. Notwithstanding advances in recent years designed to make it easier for motorists traveling out of state to simply sign a traffic citation and drive away, there are still many instances in which the sign-and-drive method does not apply. In those cases, you often must make an appearance before a court officer. That could result in your being detoured many miles out of your way and delayed for hours.</p>
        <p>''Your case may have to be heard by a justice of the peace who has gone fishing for the weekend,'' said Lynn Funkhouser, a state of Wyoming motor-vehicle official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Funkhouser is the chairman of the Nonresident Violator Compact, or N.R.V.C., which is an agreement among the majority of states that governs what happens to motorists who are stopped for moving violations outside their home states. Begun in 1972 as an aid to law-enforcement officials and motorists alike, the pact allows out-of-state drivers in most instances to sign a ticket and drive off, agreeing to appear in court or pay a fine at a later date.</p>
        <p>But the pact is not always applicable. It does not apply to tickets in your home state. It does not apply to more serious offenses, such as reckless driving, drunk driving, drag racing, excessive speeding, or driving with a suspended license.</p>
        <p>Delays in 11 States</p>
        <p>And 11 states are nonmembers - Michigan, Idaho, Nevada, Wisconsin, Washington, Arizona, Montana, Oregon, California, Alaska and Hawaii. In those states, nonresidents can face big delays if stopped for speeding and other moving violations. The same would hold true if a resident from one of the 11 states got stopped in one of the 39 states that is a member of the N.R.V.C.</p>
        <p>What happens to the motorist depends on the rules of the local jurisdiction. In many instances, the motorist would be hauled into court immediately. And if convicted, he or she would likely not be allowed to leave the locality before paying the fine and court costs.</p>
        <p>Speeding ticket fines can exceed $75, and court costs can equal or exceed that, so it is conceivable for an out-of-state motorist convicted of speeding to have to come up with $150 on the spot.</p>
        <p>''You could be in a situation where you are held overnight until you come up with the cash,'' said John Archer, a member of the government-relations staff at the American Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>As a result, increasing numbers of auto clubs, including A.A.A., the Allstate Motor Club and the Amoco Motor Club, have offered bail the Allstate Motor Club and the Amoco Motor Club, have offered bail cards as part of their membership.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the cards allow a motorist who would otherwise be forced to make an immediate court appearance to provide the ticketing officer with a bail card number. In such fashion, the auto club agrees to pay the ticket if the motorist does not pay. Bail cards can also be used in place of bail if a motorist is forced to appear in court but cannot raise the needed cash to avoid jail.</p>
        <p>''We're there to make sure you're not sitting in a courtroom for four hours or overnight in a cell,'' Mr. Archer said.</p>
        <p>Interstate Enforcement</p>
        <p>Most experts think that eventually all 50 states will join the N.R.V.C., just as almost all 50 states have signed the Drivers License Compact, which prevents the issuance of duplicate licenses, if only to improve enforcement of their own tickets.</p>
        <p>In particular, states that are members of the N.R.V.C. agree to enforce one another's moving violations. If a resident of New York State (an N.R.V.C. member) were to receive a speeding ticket in Illinois (another N.R.V.C. member), the pact would enable the New Yorker simply to sign the ticket and drive away, agreeing to pay a fine or appear in Illinois municipal court in the future.</p>
        <p>But if the fine were not paid - or if the motorist failed to appear - New York authorities would receive a notice from Illinois officials stating that an Illinois ticket had been ignored. That could trigger a suspension of the New Yorker's license.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people think that an out-of-state ticket won't show up on their driving records, that there will be no penalty, and that nobody will know,'' said John M. Peters, an assistant director at the Illinois Secretary of State's office, which oversees driving laws in that state. ''Nothing could be further from the truth.''</p>
        <p>But experts in traffic law acknowledge that it is probably possible to ignore certain out-of-state tickets with impunity. Specifically, some communities in states that are not members of the N.R.V.C. permit out-of-state motorists to pay a ticket at a later date. The traffic courts in those communities are, in effect, taking a chance, since there is no enforcement mechanism in this case, and the jurisdication is relying on the integrity of the driver to pay the ''If a state allowed one of our residents to sign and go and that state was not a member of the pact, there is literally nothing we could do to enforce the ticket,'' said Mr. Peters.</p>
        <p>But motorists should not ignore their tickets, he says, because many states keep computerized records of unpaid tickets. That is true even for unpaid parking tickets, for which there is literally no cooperation among the states when it comes to enforcement. If a motorist were stopped again in a state after ignoring, for an extended period, a ticket issued there, the consequences could be dire.</p>
        <p>''If the fine has built up, they could jail you,'' said Mr. Archer of the A.A.A.</p>
        <p>And do not even think of ignoring tickets incurred with rental cars. Although one occasionally hears stories of motorists getting off scot free, most of the major car-rental companies have systems in place to trace who was renting a car at the time a ticket was issued. The rental company then adds a charge for the ticket fine to the customer's credit-card bill.</p>
        <p>Three auto clubs that provide bail cards as part of membership are: The American Automobile Association (800-336-4357). First member is $50 in Chicago, $45 in New York City, $44 in San Francisco, and varies elsewhere. Additional members in the same family are less. Bail card service provides $500 at roadside and up to $5,000 in court.</p>
        <p>Amoco Motor Club (800-782-7887), membership $39.95. Bail card provides $50 protection at roadside.</p>
        <p>Allstate Motor Club (800-323-6282), standard membership, $36; deluxe, $49.95. Bail card provides $500 coverage for standard members, at roadside, and up to $1,000 at roadside for deluxe members.</p>
