        <p>This is my magic mountain,'' said Robert Motherwell, indicating his Greenwich, Conn., sanctuary of the past two decades - a converted carriage house that serves both as residence and studio. The artist who coined the term New York School for himself and the other Abstract Expressionists that made their mark on the art world 45 years ago now lives 32 miles from the heart of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In his tweeds and paint-spattered shoes, Mr. Motherwell shows every sign of being at home here. The artist's living area is an art-filled sunny former hayloft, which he shares with his wife, Renate Ponsold, a noted photographer whose most recent book of portraits was published last year. A large window of thick, shatterproof glass in the floor at one end reveals the artist's sweeping work space and huge canvases in the first-floor studio. One particularly notices a gargantuan work in progress, the most recent in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series. Last year, a much smaller ''Elegy'' was sold for $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>In spite of the constant demand from museums and galleries for his work, the artist has tried to impose a calming order to his life, painting every afternoon and again at night. He rises late for a simple breakfast; lunch is a soup and sandwich with his staff. But Ms. Ponsold usually cooks something special for dinner: A recent repast consisted of French sausages, leftover wild rice, roasted sweet peppers and salad with raspberry vinegar - '' one of the few recent chic things that I really like,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When the Motherwells entertain, it is more planned than in the days when the painter would bring the likes of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock by for a bite at his Greenwich Village apartment. Then Mr. Motherwell, armed with some lessons from the late Cordon Bleu cook, Dione Lucas, crafted delicacies from tongues and kidneys and such. A good bottle of California wine, he remembers, was 90 cents.</p>
        <p>Today the artists' aim is to retain such informality - but in a slightly grander fashion. Food, like art, is ''involved in the delight of the senses,'' observed the painter. Ms. Ponsold not only treats table settings as art, combining dishes and glasses to charming effect, she also brings her creativity to the presentation of the meal, telling of a party they gave for 95 where she crafted a huge fish of salmon mousse, with 18 smaller fish swimming around it.</p>
        <p>Good food has long been important to Mr. Motherwell, whose gourmet father wouldn't allow ketchup or white bread in the house. (There are over 200 well-thumbed cookbooks in the Motherwells' kitchen.) Now Ms. Ponsold, who was born in Germany but has lived in France, does most of the cooking, but when they entertain, Mr. Motherwell helps with the menu and chooses the wine.</p>
        <p>On a recent occasion, Ms. Ponsold was trying her hand once again at a favorite dish of her husband's, brandade de morue, a fragrant puree of salt cod, which he had tasted in 1938 as a young artist living in Paris. ''Through my description she worked it out,'' said Mr. Motherwell, who prefers the dish without garlic, the classic recipe. The artist pronounced the soothing creation better than memory. ''She has found some miraculous way - I don't know how to put it - to make American ingredients taste as though they were from France,'' he said.</p>
        <p>BRANDADE DE MORUE</p>
        <p>1 pound dried salt cod</p>
        <p>3 large baking potatoes</p>
        <p>6 cups unsalted fish stock, preferably homemade</p>
        <p>2 garlic cloves, crushed (optional)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>Crushed coarse sea salt to taste</p>
        <p>Freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>4 puff-pastry shells.</p>
        <p>1. Soak the cod up to 24 hours in cold water, changing the water every few hours.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.</p>
        <p>3. Bake the potatoes for an hour, or until soft. Cool and scoop out the flesh into a bowl.</p>
        <p>4. Drain the cod and discard any skin and tough parts. Cut into small squares and place them in a pot. Add the stock and simmer for 20 minutes. Drain.</p>
        <p>5. Place the fish in a bowl or mortar. Pound it to a fine paste with a wooden spoon or pestle. Add the potato flesh to the fish puree, with the garlic, if desired. Pounding constantly, add the olive oil drop by drop, then the cream. The consistency should be that of a coarse paste. Season with the salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>6. Serve the dish hot, scooped into puff-pastry shells. A more traditional way is to serve it hot or at room temperature with toast triangles fried in a little butter.</p>
        <p>Yield: Four servings.</p>
