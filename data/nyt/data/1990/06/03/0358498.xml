        <p>LEAD: One of the world's great port cities since Roman times, Lisbon is rediscovering its waterfront, and major efforts have begun to revive, expand and spruce up the neglected port area on the banks of the broad, moody Tagus River estuary. In modern times the stately Praca do Comercio, overlooking the river and framed by 18th-century arcaded government buildings was turned into a glorious parking lot.</p>
        <p>One of the world's great port cities since Roman times, Lisbon is rediscovering its waterfront, and major efforts have begun to revive, expand and spruce up the neglected port area on the banks of the broad, moody Tagus River estuary. In modern times the stately Praca do Comercio, overlooking the river and framed by 18th-century arcaded government buildings was turned into a glorious parking lot. On either side of the square, extensive docks, wharves and warehouses were left to deteriorate and the riverside was totally bereft of hotels, restaurants or cafes.</p>
        <p>Over the past year, however, several restaurants have been opened in converted warehouses and a passenger terminal. Work is underway on a vast cultural center complex at the suburb of Belem and the Monument to the Discoveries, honoring Prince Henry the Navigator is getting its first bath. The Tagus River Authority has disclosed ambitious plans to develop both sides of the river.</p>
        <p>One note: as Portuguese wages climb to European levels, Lisbon is no longer a cheap place, although there are still good bargains.</p>
        <p>Promenades</p>
        <p>Lisbon is a city for strollers, a place where life flows at a more relaxed pace than in other European capitals. The logical point of departure for a city walk is the Praca do Comercio, sometimes called Terreiro do Paco, once the riverside Palace Terrace. A triumphal arch leads to the Baixa, or low area, a neat eight-block-square grid laid out by the Marquis of Pombal after the Great Earthquake of 1755. The Baixa is gradually becoming a large pedestrian mall, with all kinds of shops, sidewalk cafes and street vendors. To the north lies the Rossio, a square lively with fountains, flower and feather merchants and crowded cafes. Dominating Rossio is the National Theater of Dona Maria II, built on the site of the palace that was headquarters of the Inquisition, and nearby, the flamboyant 19th-century Rossio railroad station. On neighboring Restauradores Square, named for the monument marking the end to Spanish occupation in 1640, stands the main tourism office, the central post office and handicrafts, clothing and ceramics shops. Beyond lies palm-lined Avenida da Liberdade and the new city.</p>
        <p>The neighborhoods that existed before Lisbon's earthquake are perched on hills, and considerable stamina plus good walking shoes are required to cope with the slippery cobblestones. Towering above the city is Castelo de Sao Jorge, built by the Visigoths in the fifth century and rebuilt by the Moors. It's best to take a taxi up to the castle garden, a delightful place to relax and admire the peacocks and view, and it's free. The descent should be made through the medieval quarter of Alfama, a warren of interconnected houses with red tile roofs, hanging laundry, potted flowers, narrow alleys and stairs, romping children and vociferous fruit and fish vendors. The best time to visit Alfama is during the street festivals from June 13 to the end of the month.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the Baixa is the 16th-century neighborhood of Bairro Alto or High Quarter, with its restaurants and taverns where people listen to that haunting, melancholy music called fado. Good fado can still be heard at Lisboa a Noite (69 Rua das Gaveas; 368557) but the current local favorite is Senhor Vinho (18 Rua do Meio-a-Lapa; 672681) in the Lapa residential district. Fado houses, which are open from 8:30 P.M. generally serve dinner, but many Portuguese prefer to dine elsewhere, then finish the evening with a jug of wine in a fado house.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>Most museums are open 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., closed Monday and holidays, and are often free on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Ancient Art (9 Rua das Janelas Verdes; 676001), admission $1.38 (at 145 escudos to the dollar), contains Portuguese paintings from the 15th to 18th century.</p>
        <p>Behind an austere facade, the Church of Sao Roque (Largo Trindade Coelho; 3460361), admission 17 cents, possesses eight richly decorated chapels and a museum of sacred art. The Madre de Deus Church (4 Rua da Madre de Deus; 8147747), founded in 1509, admission $1.38, is covered with gold carvings and tiles, and an adjacent building has been turned into a tile museum.</p>
        <p>The Museum School of Decorative Arts (2 Largo das Portas do Sol; 862183), admission $1.38, displays 17th- and 18th-century Portuguese furniture, silver and china.</p>
        <p>In Belem (Portuguese for Bethlehem), five miles west of Lisbon center, the magnificent Monastery of Jeronimos (Praca do Imperio; 3620005), admission $2.75, begun by King Manuel I early in the 16th century, commemorates Vasco da Gama's voyage to India. The southern portal and cloister are especially fine examples of Manueline architecture, characterized by exuberant sea motifs. Across the esplanade is the Tower of Belem, a fortress built in 1515 to defend Lisbon harbor.</p>
        <p>In the northern section of Lisbon are the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation Museum (45 Avenida de Berna), admission 28 cents, and across the park, the Gulbenkian Center of Modern Art (Rua Dr. Nicolau Bettencourt; 7935131), admission 28 cents. The late Armenian oil magnate spent his last years in Lisbon, leaving to the foundation his priceless collection of Middle Eastern and European art.</p>
        <p>Excursions</p>
        <p>Visitors can get a breathtaking view of the city from the river on two-hour cruises leaving from Praca do Comercio at 3 P.M. daily, from April to October for $17.25 a person. Another possibility is to take one of the frequent ferryboats from the square and scoot across the river in 20 minutes for 45 cents. A pleasurable mini-trip, only 17 cents, is the Ascensor de Santa Justa, commonly called Eiffel's Elevator for its resemblence to the tower in Paris. It runs from Rua do Ouro in the Baixa up to the 14th-century ruins of the Carmo Monastery, now an archeological museum.</p>
        <p>For a 34 cent fare the subways make a pleasant trip, even if they don't go very far, with neat stations and decorative tiles by Portuguese artists. A great excursion for 83 cents is by the scenic coastal commuter train from the Cais do Sodre railroad station, near Praca do Comercio to the sea resorts of Estoril and Cascais. Pause nine miles out of Lisbon at Oeiras at the Quinta do Marques, the Marquis of Pombal's summer palace, where you can get permission to see the wonderful formal gardens, with the Waterfall of Poets and poetic tile scenes.</p>
        <p>Shopping</p>
        <p>In August 1988, a fire destroyed much of the Chiado, the city's main shopping area, including the two main department stores. Plans have been made to restore the area's 18th-century facades but reconstruction has barely begun and the current trend is to shopping centers. Amoreiras, a spectacular shopping center, (Avenida Duarte Pacheco) has 300 boutiques where prices tend to be higher than in downtown stores. But unlike downtown, there is a large underground parking garage and shops are open lunchtime, evenings and weekends.</p>
        <p>Although good buys can still be found, prices of clothing, crystal, porcelain, gold and silver have risen substantially in the past year. Casa Bordados da Madeira (135-139 Rua 1 de Dezembro; 321447) asks $43 for a hand-embroidered Madeira linen blouse and $26 for an embroidered cotton blouse from Viana do Castelo. Shoes continue to be a good value in many stores in the Baixa, at around $60 for men and $50 for women.</p>
        <p>Ceramics run from naive terra cotta to reproductions of sophisticated 16th-century chinaware. At Arameiro (62-64 Praca dos Restauradores; 320236) a clay pig dish for roasting sausage costs about $4, while a Coimbra-style platter, with delicately painted rabbits and deer, costs $36. The best selection of hand-painted tiles is found at Fabrica Sant'Anna (95 Rua do Alecrim; 322537), where a lovely set of four tiles costs about $20.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Rates at the top hotels have reached European levels. The Ritz Inter-Continental (88 Rua Rodrigo da Fonseca; 692020) has spacious rooms, tasteful decor, attentive service and a view of the Eduardo VII Park. Double rooms start at $231, but some are $139, including breakfast between June 15 and Sept. 2, if reserved through Inter-Continental reservations (800-327-0200).</p>
        <p>The centrally situated Tivoli (185 Avenida da Liberdade; 530181), has a new swimming pool, a tropical garden and tennis court and charges from $159, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Rates at pensions and small hotels have risen substantially. The lovely little Hotel Albergaria Senhora do Monte (39 Calcada do Monte; 862846) with great views of Alfama, asks $60 for a double. York House, with its sedate English atmosphere (32 Rua das Janelas Verdes; 668143), near the Museum of Ancient Art, charges about $100 a night.</p>
        <p>Budget choices: Two downtown hotels have been blessed by quiet with the introduction of pedestrian malls in the area: the old-fashioned Borges (108 Rua Garrett; 3461951) with handsome high-ceilinged dining room, and Duas Nacoes (41 Rua Augusta; 3469710), a convenient businessman's lodging in the Baixa, charge about $50 for a double.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Leading in quality, service and atmosphere is the Aviz (12 B Rua Serpa Pinto; 328391), where a dinner of smoked swordfish and grilled lamb, including wine, will come to $40 to $55 a person. In the same class, Tagide (18 Largo da Academia Nacional de Belas Artes; 320720) offers a splendid view of the Baixa, along specialties like salmon mousse and roasted kid for about $35, with wine.</p>
        <p>One of the city's most popular bistros is Bota Alta (37 Travessa da Queimada; 327959) in Bairro Alto, where baked codfish and onions and a jug of wine is about $10.</p>
        <p>A delightful new riverside restaurant is Cais da Ribeira (Armazem A, Cais do Sodre; 323611), built in an old salt warehouse. Lunch of savory sea bream with Hollandaise sauce, with wine, is about $20. The new Maritime Terminal Restaurant (Gare Maritima, Alcantara Sul; 676335), in an old cruise ship terminal, features ''creative cuisine,'' such as steamed stone bass with champagne sauce, at about $35 a person including wine. Another new restaurant, Vela Latina (Doca do Bom Sucesso; 617118), overlooks the Belem yacht club and specializes in seafood, like shrimp in a clay pot, coming to about $20 a person.</p>
