        <p>LEAD: At least 14 people were injured last night when an escalator at the 161st Street-River Avenue subway station serving Yankee Stadium in the Bronx partially collapsed, Transit Authority officials said.</p>
        <p>At least 14 people were injured last night when an escalator at the 161st Street-River Avenue subway station serving Yankee Stadium in the Bronx partially collapsed, Transit Authority officials said.</p>
        <p>''None of these injuries appear to be life-threatening,'' said a transit spokesman, Termaine Garden.Initial reports indicated at least three people sustained broken limbs, he said.</p>
        <p>Four of the injured were taken to area hospitals and 10 were treated at the scene, said Capt. Jeffrey Armstrong of the Emergency Medical Service.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at 8:58 P.M. on an up escalator connecting the D Train of the IND line with the elevated No. 4 train of the IRT line.</p>
        <p>''One step completely collapsed and four other steps started to fold,'' which would have caused the escalator to jolt to a stop, said Mr. Garden.</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear how many people were on the escalator when it malfunctioned. As a precaution, the down escalator connecting the two lines was taken out of service, as Transit Authority maintenance crews looked for the cause. Train service was not disrupted.  A game between the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles was about 90 minutes underway at the time, but although this is the station fans use to go to Yankee Stadium, they would not likely have used this escalator, he said. Those using it would be transferring from one train to another, said Mr. Garden.</p>
