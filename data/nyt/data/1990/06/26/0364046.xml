        <p>LEAD: The Japanese Finance Ministry plans to issue guidelines to help local financial institutions stop attempts to launder illegal drug profits, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The Japanese Finance Ministry plans to issue guidelines to help local financial institutions stop attempts to launder illegal drug profits, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The guidelines, which will take effect on Oct. 1, will require banks and securities houses to be sure of the identity of depositors when they take new accounts or make cash transactions above a set amount, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Officials said Japan would report the guidelines to a seven-nation economic summit meeting in Houston that starts on July 9.</p>
        <p>Under the guidelines, banks and securities firms would be required to ask all new customers to show identification when opening accounts. The requirement would apply regardless of the amount of money involved.</p>
        <p>Industry people said the institutions would also have to be sure of a customer's identity when they handle cash transactions of more than 30 million yen ($193,824) or make remittances abroad or currency conversions of more than five million yen ($32,304).</p>
        <p>The institutions would then have to report the records of identifications and transactions to the Finance Ministry every six months and keep the data for at least five years, these people said.</p>
        <p>The planned guidelines are based on an agreement reached in February by a 15-nation panel on money laundering.</p>
