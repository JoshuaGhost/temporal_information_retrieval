        <p>LEAD: Eight members of the Supreme Court, venturing for the first time into the sensitive ''right to die'' issue, said in a ruling today that a person whose wishes are clearly known has a constitutional right to the discontinuance of life-sustaining treatment.</p>
        <p>Eight members of the Supreme Court, venturing for the first time into the sensitive ''right to die'' issue, said in a ruling today that a person whose wishes are clearly known has a constitutional right to the discontinuance of life-sustaining treatment.</p>
        <p>But the Justices differed over how specific people must be in making their wishes known. In the case before them today, the Justices ruled, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the state of Missouri can sustain the life of a woman, comatose for more than seven years, because her family had not shown by ''clear and convincing evidence'' that she would have wanted the treatment stopped.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, all the Justices but one, Antonin Scalia, clearly endorsed the view that there is a constitutional right, as part of the ''liberty'' guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, to avoid unwanted medical treatment. The Amendment's due process clause prohibits the Government from depriving any person of ''life, liberty, or property without due process of law.''</p>
        <p>Defeat for Missouri Family</p>
        <p>The decision today stated clearly for the first time what the court said could be inferred from prior decisions: ''that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment.'' The court specifically applied that principle to all patients who have made their wishes clearly known, those who are comatose as well as those who are still conscious.</p>
        <p>The decision was a defeat for the family of Nancy Cruzan, a 32-year-old woman who has been in a type of coma known as a persistent vegetative state since an automobile accident seven years ago. Her family had sought legal permission to disconnect the feeding tube that is providing the nutrients keeping her alive.</p>
        <p>The Court held that when a permanently unconscious person has left no clear instructions, a state is free to carry out its interest in ''the protection and preservation of human life'' by denying a request by family members to terminate treatment. [Excerpts from the opinions are on page A19.]  Living Wills Encouraged Doctors have said that Ms. Cruzan could live 30 more years in her unconscious condition. There are 10,000 people in the United States who are in the same type of coma as she is.</p>
        <p>But in deciding the Cruzan case, the Court - in both majority and minority opinions - made clear that it overwhelmingly supports the view that the Constitution permits a person to call off life-sustaining care. The ruling gave strong encouragement for the use of living wills and other increasingly popular techniques by which people try to insure that their medical wishes will be carried out if they become incompetent.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and, with evident reluctance, Justice Scalia. Dissenting opinions were filed by Justices John Paul Stevens and William J. Brennan Jr., who was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun. The dissenters said the Court should have permitted the termination of Nancy Cruzan's treatment.</p>
        <p>Before the automobile accident that destroyed part of her brain, Ms. Cruzan had indicated in a general way to friends and family members that she would never want to live as a ''vegetable.'' The Missouri Supreme Court rejected her family's request to cut off artificial feeding, ruling that there was not ''clear and convincing evidence'' of Ms. Cruzan's own wishes.</p>
        <p>Rigorous Standard for State</p>
        <p>In his opinion upholding that ruling, Chief Justice Rehnquist said that while a state need not apply such a rigorous evidentiary standard, ''we cannot say that the Supreme Court of Missouri committed constitutional error in reaching the conclusion that it did.''</p>
        <p>The standard of ''clear and convincing evidence'' is the highest standard of proof that courts use in civil cases. Only the courts in New York and Maine, in addition to Missouri, have required this standard in cases involving medical treatment for unconscious people.</p>
        <p>Although the Supreme Court rejected the Cruzan family's argument that the Constitution prohibited the use of such a rigorous standard, the decision was nonetheless seen as a breakthrough.</p>
        <p>''There are some wonderful things here,'' M. Rose Gasner, director of legal services for the Society for the Right to Die, said today. ''The Constitution is being applied in a brand new and revolutionary way.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Ms. Gasner said, ''it's more clear than ever before that people had better write down their wishes.''</p>
        <p>Significantly, the Court drew no distinction between providing food and water and other forms of treatment like surgical intervention or mechanical assistance with breathing. Ms. Cruzan can breathe on her own but cannot swallow, so she has been fed through a tube that is surgically implanted in her abdomen.</p>
        <p>Issue of 'Heroic' Measures</p>
        <p>One argument in the case had been that providing food and water is not medical treatment, and could not be cut off no matter what other ''heroic'' measures doctors might forgo. But a number of medical organizations filed briefs arguing that providing and regulating the formula needed by a person in Ms. Cruzan's condition was actually a delicate medical procedure, and the Court appeared to accept that assertion without addressing it directly.</p>
        <p>Missouri has a living will statute, which, like those in several other states, does not provide for the withdrawal of food and water. Alan Meisel, a medical ethics specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, said today's decision would provide legal grounds for challenging the distinction made in these laws between nutrition and other kinds of treatment.</p>
        <p>Missouri's law was not in effect at the time of Ms. Cruzan's accident, so it was not directly at issue today.</p>
        <p>The Court had never before addressed any aspect of the right-to-die issue that has commanded considerable attention from state courts and legislatures for the past 15 years. This case, Cruzan v. Missouri, No. 88-1503, has commanded more public attention that any other matter on the Court's docket since the Justices agreed to hear the family's appeal last July.</p>
        <p>'Perplexing Question'</p>
        <p>The majority opinion had a solemn, even tentative tone. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the case presented ''a perplexing question with unusually strong moral and ethical overtones.'' He disavowed any effort ''to cover every possible phase of the subject.''</p>
        <p>''The principle that a competent person has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions,'' the Chief Justice said. He referred to a series of decisions examining the rights of prisoners and inmates of state institutions to refuse various kinds of forced treatment.</p>
        <p>When the Court agreed to hear the Cruzan case, it had been widely expected that the Justices would examine whether the asserted right to die was part of the constitutional right of privacy, a right that the Court has applied to abortion and contraception. Many state courts have invoked the right to privacy in finding constitutional protection for the right to terminate medical treatment.</p>
        <p>However, Chief Justice Rehnquist said, without further explanation, that the Court would not analyze the issue as a privacy question in this case. ''We believe this issue is more properly analyzed in terms of a 14th Amendment liberty interest,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The majority traced the ''liberty interest'' in being free of unwanted medical attention to English common law when, the Chief Justice noted, ''even the touching of one person by another without consent and without legal justification was a battery.''</p>
        <p>Patient's 'Informed Consent'</p>
        <p>The Court said that this concept was the basis for the modern doctrine that medical treatment cannot proceed without a patient's ''informed consent.'' The ''logical corollary'' of that doctrine ''is that the patient generally possesses the right not to consent,'' the Chief Justice said. He said the conflict arose when an incompetent patient could not expresses his wishes.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that a number of states had imposed a lower burden of proof in these cases than had the Missouri court. He said that this was a decision that the Constitution left states free to make.</p>
        <p>''We believe that Missouri may permissibly place an increased risk of an erroneous decision on those seeking to terminate an incompetent individual's life-sustaining treatment,'' the Chief Justice said.</p>
        <p>He added that ''an erroneous decision not to terminate results in a maintenance of the status quo'' while an erroneous decision to end treatment ''is not susceptible of correction.''</p>
        <p>Strong Dissent by Brennan</p>
        <p>This analysis drew a strong dissent from Justice William J. Brennan Jr. He said that while a mistaken decision to cut off treatment ''to be sure, will lead to failure of that last remnant of physiological life, the brain stem,'' the impact of erroneously continuing treatment was also severe.</p>
        <p>Such a decision, Justice Brennan said, ''robs a patient of the very qualities protected by the right to avoid unwanted medical treatment.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''His own degraded existence is perpetuated; his family's suffering is protracted; the memory he leaves behind becomes more and more distorted. Even a later decision to grant him his wish cannot undo the intervening harm.''</p>
        <p>In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said that by focusing solely on a patient's previous statements, the Court ''fails to respect the best interests of the patient.'' He said: ''An innocent person's constitutional right to be free from unwanted medical treatment is thereby categorically limited to those patients who had the foresight to make an unambiguous statement of their wishes while competent.''</p>
        <p>Justice O'Connor made much the same point in her concurring opinion. She noted that because ''few individuals provide explicit oral or written instructions regarding their intent to refuse medical treatment should they become incompetent,'' states that require such expressions ''may frequently fail to honor a patient's intent.''</p>
        <p>But she said that the decision today raised the prospect that the Constitution might be read to require states to honor instructions left through living wills or persons designated as surrogate decision-makers.</p>
        <p>O'Connor Looks Ahead</p>
        <p>''In my view,'' she said, ''such a duty may well be constitutionally required to protect the patient's liberty interest in refusing medical treatment.''</p>
        <p>Since the four dissenters would clearly view such advance instructions as constitutionally enforceable, Justice O'Connor's opinion provided a fifth vote for that approach.</p>
        <p>Of the five separate opinions, the most bitter in tone was Justice Scalia's concurring opinion. He said the Court should have ruled that there was no constitutional component to the right to die issue. ''I would have preferred that we announce, clearly and promptly, that the Federal courts have no business in this field,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added: ''This Court need not, and has no authority to, inject itself into every field of human activity where irrationality and oppression may theoretically occur, and if it tries to do so it will destroy itself.''</p>
        <p>In its ruling, the Court did not address the rights of a patient who seeks assistance in committing suicide, an issue that has received wide publicity since a Michigan doctor helped an Alzheimer's patient kill herself earlier this month with a suicide device. Chief Justice Rehnquist noted in passing that as part of their policies for protecting human life, ''the majority of states in this country have laws imposing criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.''</p>

        <p>A front-page headline yesterday about the Supreme Court's ''right to die'' decision described the majority opinion imprecisely. The Court ruled that a state could require clear proof of a patient's intent; it did not itself impose such a requirement.</p>
