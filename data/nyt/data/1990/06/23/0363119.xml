        <p>LEAD: The Canadian Government conceded tonight that a long and divisive effort to confer a special constitutional status on Quebec had failed.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Government conceded tonight that a long and divisive effort to confer a special constitutional status on Quebec had failed.</p>
        <p>Nearly six years after it was elected on a pledge to end the divisions between Quebec and other regions of the country, the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney acknowledged that its controversial plan to designate Quebec as a ''distinct society'' within the Canadian confederation had collapsed.</p>
        <p>Many Canadians fear that the development will throw the country into the worst constitutional conflict in its history, with the strong possibility that Quebec would once again actively seek independence.</p>
        <p>End to Last-Ditch Attempt</p>
        <p>The crisis that had been building for months burst shortly before 8 P.M., when Mr. Mulroney's top constitutional aide, Senator Lowell Murray, went before reporters in Ottawa and said that the Government was abandoning a last-ditch attempt to save its constitutional plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray noted that the three-year deadline for ratification of the plan by all 10 provinces would expire at midnight Saturday and that two provinces, Manitoba and Newfoundland, had failed to adopt it. He said that Mr. Mulroney would address the nation on Saturday to announce what steps the Government would take to rescue the country from its constitutional dilemma.</p>
        <p>Quebec Asserts Identity</p>
        <p>Robert Bourassa, the Premier of Quebec, went before the National Assembly tonight in Quebec City and blamed ''English Canada'' for the collapse of the constitutional pact known as the Meech Lake accord, which Quebec signed at a lakeside retreat north of Ottawa in 1987.</p>
        <p>He said that Quebec's proposals had been ''fair and reasonable,'' but that English-speaking Canadians had continued to blame the province for the country's divisions.</p>
        <p>''English Canada must clearly understand that Quebec is in fact a distinct society, capable of assuming its identity and its own destiny,'' he said.</p>
        <p>All hope of beating the deadline vanished earlier in the day when the Manitoba legislature adjourned for the weekend without attempting to take a vote on the constitutional plan. But Senator Murray laid the blame for its failure on Newfoundland, the island province in the Gulf of St. Lawrence that was the last of the 10 to enter Canada, in 1949.</p>
        <p>After town meetings across the province to test opinion among its 570,000 inhabitants, its legislators debated the risks of rejecting the pact and contributing to the break-up of Canada and decided tonight not to vote on it.</p>
        <p>'Last Hope' Is Dashed</p>
        <p>Clyde Wells, the province's Premier, said in a speech to the legislature that he had called off a vote scheduled for late today because of what he described as the ''pressure tactics'' of Mr. Mulroney. Mr. Wells accused the Prime Minister of maneuvering to put Newfoundland into a position in which it could be blamed for allowing the pact to fail.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Murray said that Mr. Wells had broken a pledge to Mr. Mulroney and the other provincial leaders that Newfoundland would reach a decision before the deadline. By not voting, he said, Newfoundland had '''dashed the last hope'' for the pact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney predicted on Thursday that failure to adopt the pact could hand victory in the next Quebec election to the separatist Parti Quebecois, now in opposition, which tried and failed to break Quebec away from Canada in a 1980 referendum and which has pledged to renew the effort if it forms a government in the province again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bourassa, a Harvard-trained economist, had worked since his own election in 1985 to win approval for a deal that would end the constitutional isolation in which Quebec found itself after Canada adopted a revised version of its constitution in 1982 without Quebec's signature.</p>
        <p>''In the name of all Quebecers, I want to express my profound disappointment,'' he said in his address tonight.</p>
        <p>Speaking in French, Mr. Bourassa said that Quebec governments had worked for 10 years, since the 1980 referendum in which the province's voters rejected independence, to try and work out a constitutional accommodation with the rest of Canada.</p>
        <p>''Up to 1985, people said, 'What does Quebec want?' '' he said. ''We clearly explained what we wanted. Since 1985, the question has been what does Canada want? We are still waiting for Canada to respond to this.''</p>
        <p>Breakthrough Doesn't Occur</p>
        <p>Tonight's announcement of failure followed a day in which hopes had been raised by the Government's effort to create more time for the unanimous provincial consent required to ratify the Meech Lake pact.</p>
        <p>At noon, when it became obvious that the provincial leaders in Manitoba would not force a vote on the pact against the wishes of a a Cree Indian legislator who had filibustered a debate on the accord, Senator Murray called a news conference and astonished the country by saying that the Mulroney Government thought it had found a way of extending the Saturday deadline.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Mulroney had told the provincial leaders that there was no way around the deadline, and as it neared he used the time limit to pressure those opposed to the constitutional pact into concessions. But Senator Murray said today that the Government's legal experts would go to the Supreme Court and press for an extension of at least three months, possibly longer.</p>
        <p>He said that they would argue that a new vote in the Quebec legislature ratifying the pact would shift the starting point for the three-year time limit on adopting constitutional amendments from June 23, 1987, when Quebec originally ratified the pact, to Sept. 23, 1987, when Saskatchewan became the second province to approve it.</p>
        <p>Experts Were Skeptical</p>
        <p>Constitutional experts were skeptical that the Supreme Court would have accepted the plan, and opponents of the constitutional pact were furious with Mr. Mulroney for seeking to avoid the original deadline.</p>
        <p>But Canada's financial markets, which have been depressed by the prospect of the pact's collapse, reacted by pushing the Canadian dollar up against the American currency and by posting major advances in the prices of Canadian Government bonds. Prices quickly fell back again as the day progressed and the chances of ratifying the accord receded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray said this evening that the Government abandoned the idea of asking the Supreme Court to stretch the deadline when it became apparent that Newfoundland, as well as Manitoba, would not have approved the pact by the expiration of the original time limit.</p>
        <p>The Senator said the Government's original plan had been based on the assumption that the court would be sympathetic to the argument that the pact lacked unanimous provincial consent only because Manitoba had run out of time for its debate. He said the Government felt that the court would not entertain the case if two provinces had failed to ratify.</p>
        <p>''A positive vote by Newfoundland was the only basis on which we could have gone to the Supreme Court,'' he said.</p>
