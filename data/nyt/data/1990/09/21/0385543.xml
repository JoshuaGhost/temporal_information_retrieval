        <p>LEAD: The Dayton Hudson Corporation, a Minneapolis retail company, announced yesterday that it was restoring an $18,000 grant to Planned Parenthood, reversing its decision earlier this year to end 22 years of support for education programs intended to prevent pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The Dayton Hudson Corporation, a Minneapolis retail company, announced yesterday that it was restoring an $18,000 grant to Planned Parenthood, reversing its decision earlier this year to end 22 years of support for education programs intended to prevent pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Mayeda, who heads the Dayton Hudson Foundation, said the decision did not mean that either the company or the foundation was taking a position on abortion.</p>
        <p>''Our contributions have never been nor will they be used to finance abortion services,'' she said at a news conference in Minneapolis. ''We are satisfied that we can make this grant without taking a position on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said the organization was delighted by the company's decision. ''I hope it will cause other corporations to think very hard about the possible implications of the decision to defund Planned Parenthood, which is widely and broadly supported by the American people.''</p>
        <p>Reversal Seen as Expected</p>
        <p>Douglas R. Scott, director of public policy for the Christian Action Council, a group that has urged boycotts, as an anti-abortion tactic, of corporations that support Planned Parenthood, said he expected the reversal.</p>
        <p>Dayton Hudson has a long history of supporting the family planning organization, he said, ''not just financially, but philosophically.''</p>
        <p>When the company dropped its financing of Planned Parenthood education programs in August, the decision was protested by feminists and abortions rights supporters. Arvonne Fraser, wife of Mayor Don Fraser of Minneapolis, cut up her Dayton Hudson credit card and returned it. Other customers returned merchandise.</p>
        <p>Dayton Hudson was one of 46 companies whose grants to Planned Parenthood made them targets of the Christian Action Council's call for a boycott.</p>
        <p>The council, whose headquarters are in Falls Church, Va., has urged companies to remain neutral on abortion.</p>
        <p>''We believe noninvolvement means giving money to neither side,'' Mr. Scott said. ''Dayton Hudson's idea of neutrality is to give financial support to Planned Parenthood.''</p>
