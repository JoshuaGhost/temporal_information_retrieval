        <p>LEAD: By the time New Jersey has its new school financing plan fully in place in mid-1996, it will be pumping $1 billion more a year into the state's 30 poorest urban school districts, state figures show.</p>
        <p>'Tough' Scrutiny Promised</p>
        <p>After this analysis, the teams and school principals and teachers will draw up new programs tailored to each building's needs. Both these programs and the new money to finance them must be approved by Dr. Ellis before the programs start and the first increase in state aid arrives next September.</p>
        <p>''I will approve no program unless I believe it has a reasonable chance of success,'' Dr. Ellis said in an interview. ''It is imperative the money be well-spent. I don't want it to go into administration. I don't want it to go into overhead. We intend to be quite tough on this point.''</p>
        <p>In moving to send more money into the poorer school districts, New Jersey is entering an unsettled debate among education experts over whether spending more money by itself can insure better education and higher achievement by students.</p>
        <p>In a ruling last June that ordered the state to make sure that spending in its 30 poorest districts was comparable to that in its wealthiest, the New Jersey Supreme Court suggested that broader socio-economic changes might be needed to insure true educational opportunity.</p>
        <p>Performance to Be Checked</p>
        <p>Dr. Ellis and other education aides express confidence, but make no guarantees, that pouring money into these districts will result in better student performance. Three areas in particular will be closely watched, he said: test scores, dropout rates and attendance.</p>
        <p>A variety of new programs will be covered by the new aid. They include pre-kindergarten and other programs to help very young children; longer school days; broader summer school programs; the state's first tests to measure student grasp of history, English, science, geography, mathematics and other specific subjects; tutoring by peers; alternative education for high-risk students, and more extensive parental involvement in programs.</p>
        <p>In addition Dr. Ellis stressed that his aides would challenge principals and teachers in all 435 schools to offer ''innovative ways'' to improve education.</p>
        <p>''We have every expectation that we'll see substantial improvements,'' said Carl E. Van Horn, Governor Florio's director of policy and an author of the Quality Education Act, the new state law creating the urban education program.</p>
        <p>Results 'by the Year 2000'</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's fair to look for dramatic results in six months or a year,'' Dr. Ellis said. ''But by the year 2000, we should have world-class schools for every child in New Jersey, and that would mean very comparable scores for the urban, suburban and rural districts. We'll march toward that at a measured pace.''</p>
        <p>The 30 poorer districts, which serve about 25 percent of New Jersey's 1.1 million students, include troubled large districts like Newark, Camden, Paterson and Jersey City; smaller cities like New Brunswick, Perth Amboy and Asbury Park, where students have performed relatively well despite a lack of broad course offerings and well-equipped laboratories available to students in wealthy districts; and urban hubs like Phillipsburg, Vineland, and Pleasantville in sparsely settled, outlying areas.</p>
        <p>For this academic year, the 30 districts are receiving $1.3 billion of New Jersey's total education aid package of $3.5 billion, state figures show. Under the Quality Education Act, the 30 will receive $2.28 billion in the 1995-96 school year.</p>
        <p>Multimillion Increases Due</p>
        <p>Those getting the biggest increases over the five years will be Newark, up $189.4 million to nearly $500 million; Camden, up nearly $110 million to $216 million; Paterson, up $104.4 million to $223.3 million, and Jersey City, which the state now runs, up $99 million to $213.4 million.</p>
        <p>In its June ruling on equalizing school financing, the state's high court found the gap between property values - and consequently spending for each pupil - was widest between the 30 districts and the state's 54 richest. The state was ordered to put the 30 on a spending par with the 54.</p>
        <p>But the Quality Education Act, enacted about two weeks after the ruling, overhauled the state's entire financing formula in search of far broader equity. Besides the 30 poorest districts, Governor Florio's new law gives 316 other districts, most of them urban and rural, millions in new aid from a new $1.3 billion state income-tax increase.</p>
        <p>The law also imposes a state aid cut of $284 million on 232 richer districts between mid-1992 and mid-1996, and it requires all districts to pay teachers' pensions and Social Security costs, now about $900 million, for the first time.</p>
        <p>Rise of Tax Protests</p>
        <p>The law has led to a widening tax protest by residents and deep resentment in the richer districts over looming cuts in state aid.</p>
        <p>In its June ruling, the State Supreme said money alone had not cured all the ills of urban education and suggested the state address housing, employment, child care, welfare and other factors in the urban environment that shape students' lives and determine their educational needs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ellis said he had approached other departments in state government about creating ''parent academies.'' He defined them as coordinated, multi-service offices offering parents help on child-rearing, nutrition, school and social issues, job training and placement and health care. He said crime, drug abuse, poverty and rundown housing created an ''overwhelming oppressive environment'' in some cities.</p>
