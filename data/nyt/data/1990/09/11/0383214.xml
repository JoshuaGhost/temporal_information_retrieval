        <p>LEAD: Average scores on the ACT, the predominant college-entrance exam used in 28 states, were unchanged in the last school year, but members of minority groups continued to improve, the test's publishers reported today.</p>
        <p>ACT averages have been practically unchanged for the last five years, results that some say substantiate the case that the movement to improve schools has stagnated.</p>
        <p>A Broader Test</p>
        <p>Scores for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the predominant college entrance exam in the other 22 states, were reported two weeks ago. The College Board, which administers the SAT, said averages on the verbal section of the test had sunk to their lowest levels in a decade and math scores had remained unchanged for the fourth straight year.</p>
        <p>The ACT is a four-part exam testing English, mathematics, reading ability and scientific reasoning.</p>
        <p>The SAT and ACT are supposed to test a student's readiness for college. But the ACT is generally considered a broader test of high school mastery than the SAT, which tests a more circumscribed set of math, reading and language skills.</p>
        <p>The revised version of the ACT, given to students for the first time last October, included new measures of writing ability, new advanced math questions and a new reading test stressing reasoning skills.</p>
        <p>Among minority-group students, blacks averaged 17.0, up 0.4 from 1989 and up 0.8 from 1986 levels; Mexican-Americans scored an average of 18.3, up 0.2 from 1989 and 0.4 from 1986; Puerto Rican, Cuban and other Hispanic students scored 19.3, unchanged from 1989 but up 0.3 from 1986; Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders scored 21.7, down slightly from 21.9 from the 21.9 of a year ago but up from 21.6 in 1986, and American Indian and Alaskan native students averaged 18.0, up from 17.5 in 1989 and from 17.3 in 1986.</p>
