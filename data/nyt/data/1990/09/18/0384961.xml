        <p>After nearly 20 years of thinking about it, WALTER CRONKITE has sat down to write his memoirs. ''It's definitely not an expose of CBS, although I spent 40 years there,'' Mr. Cronkite said yesterday from his house on Martha's Vineyard.</p>
        <p>The chapter he is working on will serve as the material for the Theodore H. White Memorial Lecture Mr. Cronkite will deliver on Nov. 15 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. ''It's on the media and politics, an examination of what we're doing to each other,'' Mr. Cronkite said. The book is to be completed next year and published in 1992, said ASHBEL GREEN, a vice president and senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf.</p>
