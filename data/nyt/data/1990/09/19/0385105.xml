        <p>LEAD: For thousands of American children, school began in the midst of a family crisis few other Americans share.</p>
        <p>For thousands of American children, school began in the midst of a family crisis few other Americans share.</p>
        <p>Older elementary school pupils, acting more like kindergartners or first graders, balked at going back to school in the first days. Distraught children would blurt out in the middle of class, ''I want my daddy to come home.'' Or ''Where is Mommy? Is Mommy O.K.?''</p>
        <p>These pupils are the children of American troops sent to the Persian Gulf, and they fear for their parents' safety.</p>
        <p>At the military bases that deployed tens of thousands of troops in Operation Desert Shield, schools have moved quickly in the last few weeks to help the children express their fears and cope with them.</p>
        <p>Guidance in Expression</p>
        <p>At schools at Fort Bragg, N.C., home of the Army's 82d Airborne Division, and at other schools with large numbers of military dependents, coloring books were provided to children too young to articulate their worries fully so they could express them on paper. For older pupils, there was guidance in writing stories or letters to parents. Photographs of parents in uniform were posted on classroom bulletin boards.</p>
        <p>At Fort Campbell, Ky., home of the 101st Airborne Division, each base school had set up a child support system under the supervision of a guidance counselor by the time school began. Personnel whose teaching experience went back to the Vietnam War were consulted on how military children reacted during that conflict.</p>
        <p>''There are similarities but with one big difference,'' said Ray McMullen, Assistant Superintendent at Fort Campbell. ''The buildup in Vietnam took place over years; now it's taking only a few short weeks.''</p>
        <p>Frightening TV Coverage</p>
        <p>The television coverage of the troop buildup, along with the repeated showings of victims of Iraqi poison gas, is frightening for the children.</p>
        <p>''We saw a lot of separation anxiety in fourth and fifth graders. which tells us they are worried,'' said Rob Richardson, assistant principal of an elementary school at Fort Bragg, noting that this is a condition usually observed in kindergartners or first graders, who are more likely to worry about being separated from their parents.</p>
        <p>About half the 4,750 military dependents educated on the base have parents, mostly fathers, on duty in the Mideast, he said. Still more children of military personnel attend public schools off the base in the Cumberland County district, and administrators, counselors and teachers there have also moved with dispatch.</p>
        <p>''In August we instructed our principals to discuss the issues with their teachers to understand some of the worry the kids would be dealing with,'' said Dr. Rick Hollings, the supervising psychologist.</p>
        <p>''We were not only concerned with the military dependents but also with Arab kids in the schools who may be scapegoated, and children of working people in the community who will bear a severe economic blow if the deployment lasts long enough.''</p>
        <p>Fort Bragg is also the home base of the Army Special Forces units and the Delta Force unit formed for quick deployment, all heavily involved in the Mideast operation. More than 12,000 of the 44,000 pupils in the Cumberland schools are military dependents, and many of the teachers are spouses of service members.</p>
        <p>''We had a taste of this in the Panama and Grenada fighting but nothing as prolonged or as dangerous as this,'' said Dr. Joe Guiendon, Deputy Superintendent of Schools.</p>
        <p>The military has no systematic crisis intervention program exclusively for children, said Maj. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman. He said the Defense Department monitored each school to insure that children's needs were met, with administrators devising their own strategies based on established methods of relieving stress and emotional trauma.</p>
        <p>Anxiety From First Day</p>
        <p>Dr. McMullen, the Fort Campbell school official, said: ''We detected anxiety in the children from the first day of school. No doubt it reflected the anxiety felt in their home. They were withdrawing from other children, there was an increase in hyperactivity, and they brought up in class what they had seen the night before on television news.''</p>
        <p>Mike Hoover, a Colorado pscyhologist, has helped schools on military bases set up crisis intervention programs patterned on those developed to deal with suicides, gang violence and multiple-death accidents at schools.</p>
        <p>''Depression in schoolchildren tends to go unnoticed by parents and teachers because children act it out differently,'' Dr. Hoover said. ''When adults become depressed they are less energetic and may go without eating. Children do the exact opposite. They act out verbally and often get into fights.''</p>
        <p>The Fort Campbell teaching staff got firsthand experience dealing with crisis intervention with children in 1985 when a chartered airliner carrying 101st Airborne troops home from Europe crashed at Gander, Newfoundland, killing 248 soldiers.</p>
        <p>Both Parents Sent Away</p>
        <p>In the Mideast deployment, some children have both mother and father shipped overseas, and many others are in single-parent military households. Finding family, friends or neighbors to care for them indefinitely has been a problem and has exacerbated the anxiety of the children.</p>
        <p>''The chance for abuse exists and we are watching out for it,'' said Dr. Eleanor Herndon, supervisor of counseling in the Cumberland schools outside Fort Bragg. ''We also have a lot of wives under a lot of emotional and financial stress who are moving in with other families to cut expenses.</p>
        <p>''If the Gulf crisis goes on for another month or so, I'm afraid we'll see these women pull their kids out of school and move back home to grandma. Some kids may lose a full year of school.''</p>
        <p>School administrators shudder when they contemplate the possibility of Mideast combat and high American casualties. Dr. Richardson said the crisis intervention programs in the base schools were prepared to handle isolated incidents like a plane crash with 50 or 100 deaths. But he said they would be quickly overwhelmed ''with 2,000 to 3,000 killed in a day, which Saddam Hussein is telling us is going to happen.''  EDUCATION</p>
