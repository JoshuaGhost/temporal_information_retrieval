        <p>LEAD: EXECUTIVES at some of the increasingly popular class of mutual funds known as prime rate funds are struggling to determine daily prices for their portfolios. These mutual funds invest in senior bank loans that rarely trade in any public market, and calculating their daily value is ''like getting a price on a 'junk bond' that doesn't trade,'' said Christopher L.</p>
        <p>Because these closed-end mutual funds invest in short-term floating-rate bank loans, their daily value, like that of a money market fund, is supposed to remain constant. But at some of these prime funds, the net asset values - or the prices investors pay to buy new shares - have begun to fluctuate. The value of the $670 million Van Kampen Merritt Prime Rate Income Trust, for instance, has risen slightly above $10 a share because some of its loans have appreciated in value, said Jeffrey W. Maillet, the fund's portfolio manager.</p>
        <p>But on occasion the net asset value of the $1.1 billion Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust has dropped slightly below $10 for two reasons, a spokesman for the Pilgrim Group said. Pilgrim executives wrote down a $5 million loan to the Amdura Corporation in March after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. At the same time, the firm changed its accounting method, but executives would not discuss the reason for the change.</p>
        <p>This year, the five prime rate funds have been among the fastest growing of all funds and their investment returns have been the highest of all closed-end bond funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. For example, after shutting the doors to new business last winter, executives for the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves Fund in Boston reopened the fund to investors on July 31 and promptly raised an additional $100 million in one week.</p>
        <p>At the end of July, according to Lipper, the five funds had $5.5 billion in assets. The current yield was 10 percent for Van Kampen Merritt; 9.98 percent for the Merrill Lynch Prime Fund Inc.; 9.86 percent for the Pilgrim fund; 9.78 percent for Eaton Vance, and 9.75 percent for the Allstate Prime Income Trust.</p>
        <p>As the name implies, the goal of these funds is a yield that matches the prime lending rate, the benchmark rate that banks charge their highest-rated customers, currently at 10 percent. But to earn such a high yield after fees and expenses, the fund managers invest in bank loans to many low-rated, heavily indebted companies like Black &amp; Decker, Hospital Corporation of America and Stone Container.</p>
        <p>Executives concede that pricing the loans can be a problem. James B. Hawkes, president of the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance fund, compared the task to pricing real estate every day. ''The concept of a price today and a price tomorrow is not a helpful concept,'' he said. ''They don't trade every day.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, because these funds sell shares daily to the public, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned them to monitor the pricing of these loans carefully. So the funds have had to improvise. Executives of Van Kampen Merritt, for instance, use the services of a Wall Street firm that trades bank loans to price the 70 loans in their fund. ''We wanted an arms-length procedure that is similar to pricing securities,'' Mr. Maillet said.</p>
        <p>Executives at Eaton Vance and Allstate, however, calculate the daily values themselves by analyzing interest rates and other so-called ''highly leveraged transactions,'' executives of these firms say. And unless a company has defaulted on a loan, Merrill Lynch carries the loan at its face value, said Gregg Durett, a vice president.</p>
        <p>As in any market, of course, changes in supply and demand determine these loan prices. And even in this thinly traded market some loans command a premium while others sell at a discount. These days, some loans made to RJR Nabisco Inc. at the time of the 1989 leveraged buyout are considered ''cool'' and are less attractively priced than others, Mr. Snyder of the Loan Pricing Corporation said. ''Hot'' bank loans - those in high demand - include Gulfstream Aerospace, he said.</p>
        <p>Because some funds' holdings are substantial, any discrepancies between a loan's market value and the price a fund uses to calculate its net asset value could be significant. For instance, Merrill Lynch has about $90 million invested in a short-term loan to Scotsman Manufacturing, which makes commercial prefabricated buildings. And Eaton Vance has $125 million, or about 7 percent of its portfolio, in one of the cool loans to RJR.</p>
        <p>Because of their unusually strict policy on redemptions, though, it is unlikely that these fund managers will have to liquidate loans at market prices. But the price investors pay to buy new shares in these funds may not be exactly accurate.</p>
