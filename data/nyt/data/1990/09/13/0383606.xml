        <p>LEAD: A former senior Cuban official involved in recent negotiations with the Soviet Union said today that Moscow's moves toward a market economy and scheduled cuts in Soviet aid to Cuba would cripple the island's economy within a year and a half unless radical policy changes were introduced by President Fidel</p>
        <p>''The honeymoon has ended and now Cuba has no opportunity for re-exporting oil,'' Mr. Gonzalez said at a conference sponsored by the University of Miami's Research Institute of Cuban Studies. ''Even if they wanted to, the Soviets have no capability to maintain the kind of financial aid they have maintained during the last 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Drastic Cuts Ahead</p>
        <p>While Cuban officials have spoken in general terms about major changes in relations between the Soviet Union and Cuba, Mr. Gonzalez is the first Cuban involved in the negotiations with Moscow to reveal substantial details.</p>
        <p>In tense discussions in Moscow and Havana early this year, Mr. Gonzalez said, the Soviet Union informed Cuba of its intention to reduce its support drastically in almost every area of economic aid, from barter trade to subsidized prices for Cuban products and low-interest debt financing.</p>
        <p>While Cuban officials reacted with surprise when the Soviet newspaper Izvestia published previously secret information on Cuba's debt to Moscow this year, Mr. Gonzalez said that he learned in a meeting with Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the vice president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, that the Soviet debt figure of 15 billion rubles was, by Cuban calculations, at least 2 billion rubles too low.</p>
        <p>The difference took on special importance, Mr. Gonzalez said, because of a warning by a Soviet Deputy Prime Minister, Leonid Abalkin, during a visit to Havana in April that Cuba's debt to the Soviet Union would be payable in dollars beginning in 1995, at an exchange rate to be determined this year.</p>
        <p>'Special Period' Lies Ahead</p>
        <p>Cuba has reacted to these and other changes in its ties with the Soviets by preparing people for what the Havana Government has called a ''special period in a time of peace,'' an era of draconian austerity that began recently when the Government announced steep reductions in supplies of electricity and gasoline.</p>
        <p>After an initial period of hostility toward President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's restructuring program in the Soviet Union, Mr. Castro has reverted to a largely conciliatory tone.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gonzalez said that official Cuban disenchantment with the dwindling Soviet commitment manifests itself in complaints that many large Soviet industrial development projects are white elephants that have proven burdensome to the Cuban economy.</p>
        <p>Nuclear Plant Cited</p>
        <p>He cited an inoperative nuclear power plant that is $800 million over cost and is now encased in walls six yards thick because of concerns over safety after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Another example, he said, was a new Soviet-built nickel plant that is at least twice as inefficient as plants dating from the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Citing an energy shortage, the Cuban Government recently decided to close the nickel plant, Mr. Gonzalez said. But at least part of the motive for closing it, he added, was to send Moscow a message that ''if you reduce our oil supplies, we can reduce supplies to you too.''</p>
