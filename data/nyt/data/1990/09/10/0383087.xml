        <p>LEAD: As the new era began so well for Rutgers on Saturday night at Giants Stadium, the only disappointment was too few witnesses to the 24-8 victory over Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Tarver's statistics were modest, 9 completions of 15 attempts, 172 yards, no interceptions, but Rutgers intercepted six Kentucky passes, two by Willie Wilkes with one returned for a touchdown and two by the freshman safety, Malik Jackson.</p>
        <p>''Great defense, a great start,'' said Graber. Next for the Scarlet: Colgate at home.</p>
        <p>Syracuse Prevails</p>
        <p>Temple gave Syracuse a battle but the Orange prevailed, 19-9. The Owls' defense took the option play away from Marvin Graves, Syracuse's precocious quarterback who wound up with 8 net yards running, 218 by passing with two touchdowns, two interceptions and two sacks.</p>
        <p>Rob Carpenter, the talented receiver, caught five, one for a touchdown, but also sprained an ankle.</p>
        <p>Matt DeGennaro, Connecticut's talented quarterback, sprained ribs on a bad day for the Huskies, the Yankee Conference favorites. They were outplayed and outscored by New Hampshire, 21-16.</p>
        <p>DeGennaro was injured in the second quarter but stayed in the game, taking more hits from the Wildcats who overwhelmed Connecticut's offensive line.</p>
        <p>A Romp for Villanova</p>
        <p>The result skewered the conference outlook as did Villanova's 31-7 romp over Maine, last year's champion. The Wildcats outgained the Bears, 417 yards to 121, and held Carl Smith, Maine's star runner, to 26.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts held Holy Cross, favored by three touchdowns, to a 10-10 tie. In their last two games, 1986 and 1987, the Crusaders had beaten the Minutemen by the combined total of 95-17 and also had won 40 in a row against I-AA opponents.</p>
        <p>Two attempts to break the tie failed. A pitchout to Joe Segreti from a pressured Tom Ciaccio, the Holy Cross quarterback, was fumbled as UMass recovered at its 5. With 14 seconds left, Minuteman Marco Gabrielli tried to kick the air out of the football on a 49-yard field goal attempt that was 20 yards short.</p>
        <p>Navy's new coach, George Chaump, also began with a victory, 28-17, as Alton Grizzard threw for three touchdowns and ran for another in a pro-style offense. He had been mostly a wishbone runner before.</p>
        <p>Pitt Unyielding</p>
        <p>Pitt gave Boston College's quarterbacks, Willie Hicks and Glenn Foley no breaks, intercepting six of their passes in a 29-6 triumph.</p>
        <p>Was it football or give-back ball that Bucknell and Hofstra played at Lewisburg, Pa.? There were 15 turnovers, 10 of them intercepted passes with five for each side.</p>
        <p>The decision went to the Flying Dutchmen, 42-29, thanks to 22 points in the third period. Their run-and-shoot offense was balanced, 254 yards passing by Rhory Moss and 203 rushing.</p>
        <p>Lehigh romped over Fordham, 35-3, the sixth decisive defeat since beginning I-AA competition last season by a combined score of 221-47.</p>
        <p>Bob Ricca, the St. John's coach, did a commendable job getting his team ready to play favored Iona in the Liberty Conference's key game.</p>
        <p>Freshman Quarterback Shines</p>
        <p>With new starters at the offensive skilled positions, the Redmen won, 21-14, and Ricca knew exactly when (third quarter) to use the freshman quarterback, Sean Sharkey, whose passes led to two touchdowns.</p>
        <p>Kings Point gave away its game to Coast Guard. The Mariners had a 17-0 lead and outgained the Cadets, 365 yards to 154, but lost, 21-17. Five of Larry Redmond's passes were intercepted - two in the end zone and another was returned for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>Montclair State began its new season auspiciously with a 21-0 victory over Buffalo as John Walker, the key running back, gained 225 yards, 80 on one play. The new quarterback, Steve Banas from Mahwah, N.J., was shaky but adequate.</p>
        <p>Three other New Jersey Conference teams fared well. Ramapo beat Stony Brook of the Liberty Conference, 24-0; Jersey City State topped Gallaudet, 19-3, and William Paterson took Pace, 27-13. The loser was Kean, defeated by Lycoming, 30-20.</p>
