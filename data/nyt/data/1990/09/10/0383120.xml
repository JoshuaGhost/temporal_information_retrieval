        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:  As your column points out, the document was accepted in all the states that we dealt with.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as you fail to point out, the durable power of attorney was useless in dealing with the Federal Government and its agencies. The hassle we got from the Internal Revenue Service and the Army (my father was a retired officer) was unbelievable. They would not accept a power of attorney, but only a court order of guardianship. The expense and trouble were too great. Not until my father died and I became executor of the estate, could I clear up the troubles with the Government.</p>
        <p>For relatives of the elderly ill, a durable power of attorney will be a partial solution until Federal legislation mandates that the Federal Government must accept it like everyone else.</p>
