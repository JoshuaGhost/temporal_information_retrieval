        <p>LEAD: The men's final at the United States Open unfolded like an unrequited love affair yesterday, and by the end of it, one of the players was mightily upset. Unheralded and underestimated, Pete Sampras produced a barrage of bravura serves, one-way passing shots, and viperish volleys from start to finish while his opponent, the ultra-visible Andre Agassi, backed farther and farther into a corner, his persona and his tennis game reduced to silence, a most unfamiliar predicament.</p>
        <p>The match was the first Open final to be contested by two Americans since 1979, and Sampras became the first American to win this Grand Slam tournament since John McEnroe captured his fourth Open title in 1984.</p>
        <p>Moving Into Top 10</p>
        <p>Sampras's stunning demotion of Agassi, the world's No. 4 player, sent the serve-and-volleyer into the top 10 for the first time in his career with an official computer ranking of No. 6. For Agassi, the loss meant that he had, once again, failed to deliver the championship mettle to match his matinee idol stature. Agassi has played the role of runner-up in two Grand Slams this year, the French and United States Opens.</p>
        <p>But Agassi said he felt less disappointed in himself yesterday than he had at Paris, where he felt a more persevering performance might have earned him the title at the expense of Andres Gomez.</p>
        <p>'Anything He Touched Turned to Gold'</p>
        <p>''When someone is beating you like he was, there's not a whole lot to get frustrated about,'' said Agassi, who couldn't damage Sampras's serve and had a wrenching time trying to hang onto his own. ''Today I wanted it, but nothing went right. I'd have to say it's the first time I've been focused and determined and done nothing with it. Anything he touched turned to gold out there.''</p>
        <p>Sampras doled out 13 aces and lost only 17 points in 13 service games, a remarkable dominance that left Agassi reeling.</p>
        <p>''Your chances of returning serves hit 100 m.p.h. are pretty slim, not to mention when he can blast one at 120 m.p.h.,'' Agassi said. ''He put together some really exceptional placement on his serves in the last two weeks.''</p>
        <p>Sampras, a player who categorized his service motion as ''weak'' just five years ago, said he revamped his game by switching to a one-handed backhand and learning how to hit a reasonable volley. Too, he grew to 6 feet, bulked up his muscles on a training regimen derived from Lendl's iron-man program, and switched from playing like a counterpuncher to pummeling like an instigator.</p>
        <p>''My whole game revolves around my serve now,'' said Sampras, ''and with me serving this well all week, it kind of puts a seed of doubt in the minds of the guys you play that if he plays one bad game, the set could be over.''</p>
        <p>That's precisely what happened to Agassi three times over.</p>
        <p>Three Consecutive Aces</p>
        <p>In the opening set, Sampras had Agassi on the retreat right from the first game. He forced the flashier player into submission by making him work his way out of two break points, held his own serve at love in the second game, and broke Agassi in the third. Sampras next added insult to injury by piling up three consecutive aces in the fourth game to hold at love again and take a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>There was more of the same trouble in store for Agassi in the second set, when Sampras snared a break point in the fifth game by plastering a forehand service return down the line, nearly knocking Agassi over when he tried to intercept it. On the next point Sampras galloped to the net and used a one-two combination of a backhand stretch volley and a forehand volley winner to knock Agassi out of the game.</p>
        <p>After breaking a forlorn Agassi at love in the sixth game of the third set, Sampras launched his 100th ace of the tournament to hold serve for a 5-2 advantage. Instead of serving himself into a tighter set in the final game of the match, Agassi ended his agony by flapping a forehand into the net at match point.</p>
        <p>'No Nerves at All'</p>
        <p>''I had a great time out there,'' Sampras said, ''right from the first point, no nerves at all. Today was the best I could possibly play, the best all week and all year and it couldn't have happened at a better time. I really don't know if anyone could have beaten me.''</p>
        <p>Agassi felt the afternoon's denouement to be appropriate to its New York setting.</p>
        <p>''This was a good old-fashioned street mugging out here, that's all it was,'' Agassi said of his inability to put up a fight against Sampras. ''I was confident before it, real confident. If I had to bet on it I would have said, 'Hey, I can come out of this on top.' For the first two sets, I was completely on the defensive. But it's not like I just lost it: I got my butt kicked.''</p>
        <p>The 20-year-old from Las Vegas, Nev., is accustommed to being in the spotlight, but yesterday Sampras turned him into little more than a stage prop.</p>
        <p>Trail of Upsets</p>
        <p>''He looked really tentative,'' Sampras said. ''He wasn't hitting his groundies as deep and clean as usual and I took advantage of that. He wasn't being the aggressor; he was letting me dicate the points.'' Sampras, transformed into a giant-killer as he blazed a trail to his first Grand Slam final, turned back McEnroe in the semifinals as a postlude to knocking another veteran, the three-time champion Ivan Lendl, out of the semifinals. Sampras set the tone for his tear by dispatching Thomas Muster of Austria, the world's sixth-ranked player.</p>
        <p>''I'm a normal 19-year-old growing up and doing a very unusual job and doing very unusual things like I did today,'' said Sampras, who laughed off the prospect of receiving a congratulatory telephone call from Preident Bush. ''The President? My phone's off the hook.''</p>
