        <p>The general manager of the Islanders, Bill Torrey, confirmed yesterday that the absence of the team's star center, Pat LaFontaine, from the final week of training camp was linked to a contract dispute. Torrey, who joined the Islanders in California yesterday for an exhibition game against Los Angeles, said he had not yet been able to meet with LaFontaine but has had numerous discussions with the player's agent, Don Meehan.</p>
        <p>''Obviously there seems to be a problem,'' said Torrey. ''The facts are that he has a two-year deal, that I have offered to extend his contract, and the discussion has been going on all summer long.''</p>
        <p>Last season LaFontaine, the club's leading scorer for the last three years, scored a career-high 54 goals and 105 points and was the league's eighth-leading scorer, a level of productivity not reflected by his $400,000 base salary. Torrey said he recognized that LaFontaine was due a raise but said he was uncertain when he and Meehan would come to terms. With or without LaFontaine, the Islanders will open their regular season on the road Thursday against the Kings.</p>
