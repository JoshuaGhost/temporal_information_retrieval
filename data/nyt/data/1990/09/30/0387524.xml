        <p>Should courts divide between two what God has given to one? In one of the more notable recent tests of the premise that a husband or wife who aids in a spouse's rise to fame is entitled to a share in the value thereof, a New York court last week rejected a claim by Peter Elkus, former husband of the opera star Frederica von Stade. The two met as aspiring music students; she went on to become an internationally acclaimed mezzo-soprano, he went on to become her photographer, adviser and voice teacher. When their 17-year marriage ended, Mr. Elkus claimed that his wife's fame was marital property that he was entitled to share. Her lawyer argued, and the judge apparently agreed, that marital property does not include one spouse's ''God-given talent or recognition.'' Mr. Elkus's lawyer said he would appeal.</p>
