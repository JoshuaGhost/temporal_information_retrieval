        <p>In Hollywood, where Archibald Leach became Cary Grant, the ''X'' rating last week had its name changed to ''NC-17.'' The change, announced by Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, came amid a rising chorus of complaints that the trade association's rating system was outdated and unfair. Filmmakers complained that because the X designation had come to be strongly identified with pornographic films and many theaters would not exhibit them, producers were effectively barred from making serious films containing material that might earn the dreaded X. The change came just a day before the director of ''Harry and June,'' a new big-budget film from Universal Pictures, had intended to challenge the rating system, and the X it gave his movie, at a hearing in New York.</p>
