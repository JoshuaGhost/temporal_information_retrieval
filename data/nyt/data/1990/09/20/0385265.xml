        <p>LEAD: Thomas L. Raleigh Jr., a former co-chairman of operations and deputy senior partner of Price Waterhouse-U.S., died Sunday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. He was 63 years old.</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Raleigh Jr., a former co-chairman of operations and deputy senior partner of Price Waterhouse-U.S., died Sunday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. He was 63 years old.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the accounting company said he died after a stroke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raleigh, a longtime resident of Boston, moved to Jaffrey, N.H., when he retired in 1988.</p>
        <p>He joined Price Waterhouse in 1953 and was admitted to the partnership in 1962. A decade later he was put in charge of the company's Boston office, and he moved up to head its Northeast region in 1981. He became co-chairman and deputy senior partner in 1986.</p>
        <p>He was captain of the basketball and tennis teams at Princeton University in the 1949-50 season. He won several New England men's singles and doubles championships in tennis and was ranked among the region's top five players over the age of 35 and then over 45.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raleigh, who was born in Syracuse and graduated from Phillips Andover Academy, received a bachelor's degree from Princeton and a master's degree in business administration from Syracuse University. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Ann McChesney; two sons, Thomas Raleigh 3d of Orlando, Fla., and John Raleigh of Manhattan; two daughters, Katherine Thigpen of Lula, Ga., and Nancy Van Siclen of Moraga, Calif., and five grandchildren.</p>
