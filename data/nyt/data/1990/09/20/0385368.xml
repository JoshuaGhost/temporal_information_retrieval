        <p>LEAD: The Xerox Corporation said today that it would offer its office automation computer software for use on computers made by other manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The Xerox Corporation said today that it would offer its office automation computer software for use on computers made by other manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Xerox is staking a claim to software that allows workers to collaborate on tasks, like writing a report. The software does this by exchanging information on desktop computers linked by networks. Xerox's software, once called Viewpoint and now renamed Globalview, competes with such products as New Wave Office from the Hewlett-Packard Company and Officevision from the International Business Machines Corporation.</p>
        <p>By allowing its software to run on industry-standard computers, rather than just its own machines, Xerox hopes to broaden its appeal and become a leading supplier of networking software to corporations.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at its research center here, Xerox said it would begin selling, under its own name, a $10,000 computer work station made by Sun Microsystems Inc. that would run the Globalview software. It also announced a $4,000 kit consisting of a circuit board and a computer screen, that would turn an I.B.M. or compatible personal computer into a work station that can hook into a Xerox network and run the Xerox software.</p>
