        <p>Shortly after our second daughter was born, I found a urologist in the Yellow Pages and made an appointment for a ''pre-vasectomy conference.'' To prevent children, my wife, Shoshana, had undergone eight years of diaphragms, jellies and foams. To create them, she had undergone four years of episiotomies, palpations, probes and sonograms. A vasectomy seemed the least I could do. In the waiting room, we filled out our reproductive short form. ''How many pregnancies have you had?'' ''How many children do you have?'' Besides our two daughters, there had been the cry of pain from the upstairs bathroom six weeks into my wife's second pregnancy. I had sprinted into the room and joined Shoshana, who was more upset than injured. We stood together at the toilet, staring down at a small, discrete pool of blood. Worse still was a pregnancy a year later that ended when a routine sonogram showed a great plume of matter spilling out of a gap in the fetal skull. At last, at 42, I was a man with a reasonable possibility of passing his genes into the next generation.</p>
        <p>Moments after we were shown into his office, the doctor appeared. He seemed nervous. He sat on his hands as he studied our faces. His teeth were ground down into even rows. We were prepared for a thorough grilling, similar to what you'd go through to become a Catholic or to get a mortgage. He had only two questions. He turned first to me: ''You know you're gonna be sterile, right?'' I nodded. He then looked at Shoshana: ''You understand you'll never have babies with him again?'' She said that was the point. He rose and offered me a clipboard with a piece of paper on it. He said to sign it and see Jill for an appointment. Basically, the form said that we knew it wasn't his fault if our family continued to expand after his procedure. These things happen, it seemed to say. Jill was around the corner. She checked to see that we had both signed the form, and then began flipping through the doctor's calendar. ''He likes to schedule vasectomies on Fridays,'' she said, without looking up. ''That way you have the whole weekend to recover. But he's on vacation all next month . . . let's see . . . you could do it tomorrow morning at 8.'' ''Yes, tomorrow,'' I heard myself say. ''Bring a jockstrap and shave your scrotum,'' Jill said.</p>
        <p>The saga of a vasectomy is the closest thing men have to a birth story, and we delight in telling it just as mothers take pleasure in reconstructing for one another each delivery. Quickly, I called the friends I knew who had been, as they put it, ''snipped.'' I sought reassurance. Instead, I got Omaha Beach. Mason said the pain had caused him to pass out on the operating table. Geoff's left testicle had exploded into a baseball-sized knot the next day.</p>
        <p>In John, I found the male analogue to the archetypical field mother who ejects her baby in the paddy, scoops it up and goes right on working. John had hopped off the table and gone straight back to work. He said he lasted two hours before the pain brought him to his knees. These guys weren't going to baby me. They saw themselves as unappreciated survivors of a passage through hell. They'd seen the discomfort their friends experienced when they brought the topic up. Now, they rarely talked to anyone except other veterans about their vasectomies. They were silent soldiers who had had the vision to disarm. Firing blanks now, they were the few, the proud, the brave, the sterile.</p>
        <p>They seemed to be asking me what was increasingly on my mind: Did I really have the guts to join them? The next morning, I wobbled alone out the door, jock in hand, wishing Shoshana had insisted upon going with me. I arrived at the day-surgery wing of Maine Medical Center and waited in a large room already filled with people awaiting surgery. At one point, the surgery doors swung open and a medic, his hair in a mint-green plastic cap, ran out to seize a woman's arm and haul her back in.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Hoose.'' The voice startled me. A man about my age, dressed in a blue cotton gown, led me through the doors into a small, windowless room containing only a table on which a white sheet had been spread. A single visored light hung over it. ''Get into this gown, frontways, then get on the table, '' said my companion.</p>
        <p>My heart was racing. It wasn't too late to back out. Just a few close friends knew where I was. I could always tell them I went through with it. Shoshana wasn't forcing this on me; she'd probably even cover for me when the questions came.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Hoose.'' The gowned man was standing by the table, probably reading my mind. I shook myself, pulled on the gown and climbed onto the table. The attendant lifted my gown and peered beneath it. ''Didn't they tell ya to shave?'' he said, clearly disgusted. He lathered up my testicles and scraped them clean with a straight razor.</p>
        <p>The doctor burst in and looked at the names on his daily schedule. ''Well, Mr. Hoose, this is rather sudden,'' he said cheerfully, scrubbing his hands. While they looked carefully under my gown, I inspected the instruments the doctor had arrayed on a small tray. My eyes rested, widened, and remained upon an amazingly long hypodermic needle.</p>
        <p>They placed a screen in front of my eyes. ''This will take exactly 12 minutes,'' the doctor said, pulling on clear rubber gloves. He picked up the needle. ''I'm gonna numb you up a little now,'' he said, ''You'll feel a little bite.'' It came. Not bad, really. Then another little bite. ''O.K.,'' he said, ''you're gonna feel this. Grab hold of something.'' I would have bolted, but in the next instant, he plunged the needle into the right side of my scrotum. I will not burden anyone with a description of the river of pain I felt then, or when he repeated his master stroke on the left side of my scrotum. It turns out the scrotum becomes numb at once. Though I could hear him behind the screen, I couldn't feel him as he severed the vas deferens, or tube that delivers sperm cells to the penis, and cauterized and tied the two new ends.</p>
        <p>The doctor grew chatty as he finished. He said I had guts, and volunteered that my wife was good-looking. Still shaken, I managed to ask him how the vasectomy end of his practice was doing. His tone turned solemn. For every hero like me there were countless chickens - he used that word - guys who allowed their women to get slit open like pigs and risk the complications of surgery instead of bearing down for a few minutes as I had. I swam in his praise.</p>
        <p>He straightened up, pulled off his gloves and walked around the screen. ''You got about an hour until the Novocain wears off,'' he said. ''Put on a jock and go get some painkiller. Good workin' with you.'' He offered a flat, fraternal hand, palm down, like a Beta or a Sigma Chi. I gave it a clammy shake and eased myself down from the table.</p>
        <p>On the way to the pharmacy, I continued to think about the doctor. He had been embarrassed when Shoshana was present during the conference, but in the operating room he, and his assistant, had been good company. The operating room had had a locker-room feel to it. There we were, three guys, working on my testicles, but there had been no need for jokes, and no embarrassment.</p>
        <p>Forty-five minutes later, with the feeling starting to creep back between my legs, I scored some Advil, climbed into loose pajamas and waited, alone, to hit the wall of pain. Frankly, it never came. I got bored and went back to work about 2. That evening, I called my sterile friends and delivered my story, lingering over the long needle. I could feel them nodding. I'm in pretty bad shape now, I told them, my breath halting from time to time, but in a week or so I'll be myself. They seemed to understand.</p>
