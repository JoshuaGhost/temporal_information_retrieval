        <p>LEAD: FOR most of us, Pomerol is the mailing address for Chateau Petrus. It is, in fact, home to some of the finest wines - and smallest vineyards - in all of Bordeaux. The whole place, all 2,000 acres of it, couldn't provide the grapes for a day's run of white zinfandel, and some of the smaller properties, Petrus among them, wouldn't make a decent parking lot in Napa</p>

        <p>LEAD: FOR most of us, Pomerol is the mailing address for Chateau Petrus. It is, in fact, home to some of the finest wines - and smallest vineyards - in all of Bordeaux.

        <p>FOR most of us, Pomerol is the mailing address for Chateau Petrus. It is, in fact, home to some of the finest wines - and smallest vineyards - in all of Bordeaux. The whole place, all 2,000 acres of it, couldn't provide the grapes for a day's run of white zinfandel, and some of the smaller properties, Petrus among them, wouldn't make a decent parking lot in Napa Valley.</p>
        <p>Petrus - somehow it's hard to call the place a chateau - has less than nine acres of merlot vines, merlot being the grape of Pomerol. But then so do Trotanoy, Vieux Chateau Certan, La Conseillante and well over 100 others among the commune's approximately 160 properties.</p>
        <p>The biggest vineyard in Pomerol, 100 acres, belongs to Chateau de Sales. A few others, Gazin, Nenin, Taillefer and La Pointe, average just under 60. According to Edmund Penning-Rowsell, the historian of Bordeaux, some 25 producers in Pomerol work less than two and a half acres. This is really a cottage industry.</p>
        <p>And such it would have remained had it not been for one remarkable group, the Moueix family. With a little help from America.</p>
        <p>The Moueixes are natives of the Correze, a downtrodden region that might not unjustly be called the Appalachia of France. They are art and chateau collectors now, but they still work and play with the energy of people not distantly removed from hard soil and harder times.</p>
        <p>In the grim years between the wars, Jean-Pierre Moueix, the patriarch, sold wine door to door in sooty Belgium and the coal-mining towns of northern France. The north had always been a good market for Pomerol wines and as he prospered Mr. Moueix built up his wholesale business in Libourne, the commercial center for Pomerol and St.-Emilion, and he invested in the vineyards whose wine he was selling.</p>
        <p>Today the family owns most of the shares of Petrus, chateaus Magdelaine and Trotanoy, plus lesser-known estates in Pomerol, adjoining Lalande-de-Pomerol and in nearby Canon-Fronsac. They manage a number of other properties and are part owners of Dominus, a California winery that gained acclaim with its first release, 1984, and they own a remarkable wine shop in the city of Bordeaux called l'Intendent. The wines there are displayed on a spiraling ramp just as pictures are shown at the Guggenheim Museum.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Moueix, whose business is now in the hands of his two sons, is said to have had a passion for wagering to equal his love of art. Accordingly, as a wine merchant he was not averse to gambling everything on a good vintage. In his case it was 1959, one of the best of the middle years of the century. It made his fortune, or at least the basis of it.</p>
        <p>Actually, he had begun to increase his holdings in Petrus just after the war. The property had been owned by a family named Arnaud since the middle of the 18th century. Edmond Loubat began to buy shares in the property around 1925. After his death his wife continued to buy and, by 1945 - a great vintage year, incidentally owned all of Petrus. Soon thereafter, Mr. Moueix became the manager and a part owner. He and his sons have continued to increase their holdings, with the Loubats' descendants still holding some shares.</p>
        <p>Christian Moueix, Jean-Pierre's son and the current manager of Petrus, attributes the wine's exceptional depth and power to severe selection and old vines. The average age of the vines at Petrus is about 45 years.</p>
        <p>The wine of Petrus had long enjoyed a special reputation, but mostly in France and Belgium. In Britain, the land of Bordeaux connoisseurs, it was rarely offered for sale until after World War II. Its current - some would say overblown - reputation in the United States dates from the late 1950's when a group that included Sam Aaron, a New York wine merchant, managed to corner several good vintages of the property. Mr. Aaron said the late Henri Soule, the owner of the Pavillon restaurant in New York, was offered the wine at an irresistibly low price. He in turn urged it on his famous clients, including his backer, Joseph P. Kennedy, at a handsome markup.</p>
        <p>Madame Loubat, had always been convinced that her wine was the equal of anything the Medoc could produce; a New York restaurant owner proved that in terms of price at least, she was right. Today Petrus fetches prices well above those of the traditional first growths, Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Margaux, Mouton-Rothschild and Haut-Brion, and competes only with Chateau d'Yquem in Sauternes and the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti in Burgundy for the title of France's most expensive wine.</p>
        <p>According to The New York Wine Cellar, a publication that lists local wine prices, the best recent prices of 1986 Lafite, Latour, Margaux, Mouton and Haut-Brion were $60, $57.50, $70, $66.50 and $56, respectively. The best price on 1986 Petrus: $165.</p>
        <p>Petrus has enhanced the reputation of all Pomerols. That coupled with the fact that the properties are so small has meant that prices of Pomerol's best wines have held at consistently high levels. Well-known properties like Le Gay, Latour a Pomerol, Vieux Chateau Certan, Trotanoy, La Conseillante and l'Evangile, regularly command prices in the same range as first and second growths in the Medoc. What's more, in some years they can come close to and perhaps match Petrus itself.</p>
        <p>At the same time, because Pomerol was relatively unknown in this country for so long, there are many smaller properties whose prices are, relatively at least, still reasonable. Among them are Chateau Bon Pasteur, which is owned by Michel Rolland, a grower and wine maker whose reputation is second only to that of the Moueixes. Chateaux Bonalgue, Lagrange, Petit-Village (owned by Bruno Prats, of Chateau Cos d'Estournel), Rouget and La Violette are other Pomerols to look for.</p>
        <p>TASTINGS</p>
        <p>Travaglini Gattinara, Piedmont, 1985; about $12. The best-known red wine grape of the Piedmont region of Italy is the nebbiolo. It is the grape of the most powerful Barolos and of the most refined Barbarescos. It shows up under the name Spanna and it also appears under its own name, most successfully as Nebbiolo d'Alba, after the white-truffle capital of Piedmont where this particular wine is made. In a Barolo or a Barbaresco, nebbiolo can be an expensive proposition. Ghemme and Gattinara are two more modest alternatives. Ghemme is mostly nebbiolo, blended with a grape called vespolina. Gattinara can be 100 percent nebbiolo or it can be a blend of nebbiolo and bonarda. In the Piedmont, just as in Burgundy, the producer is as important as the wine, and the house of Travaglini is one of the best Gattinara makers. The wine is said to be less structured than Barolo but there is no lack of backbone in this inky-dark, rich wine. And at five years of age, it is just right for drinking now.</p>
