        <p>LEAD: Frank Harris Johnson, a retired professor of biology at Princeton University, died on Saturday at Princeton Medical Center in New Jersey. He was 82 years old and lived in Princeton.</p>
        <p>Frank Harris Johnson, a retired professor of biology at Princeton University, died on Saturday at Princeton Medical Center in New Jersey. He was 82 years old and lived in Princeton.</p>
        <p>He died of complications from a recent stroke, a university spokesman said.</p>
        <p>In 1960, Dr. Johnson helped separate luciferin, a light-emitting compound, from a South Pacific luminescent fish and isolate the luciferin crystals. He also focused his bioluminescent investigations on studies of antibiotic compounds, basic mechanisms of drug action and environmental factors like deep-ocean temperature and pressure. His research led to the development of the most sensitive test for calcium in muscle tissue.</p>
        <p>He was a native of Raleigh, N.C., and a 1930 graduate of Princeton. He received a master's degree from Duke University in 1932 and a doctorate from Princeton in 1936. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1937 and retired in 1977.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Frances McGhee; three daughters, Lanie Johnson of Manhattan, Mary Frances Cunningham of Bridgeport, N.Y., and Charlie Pierce of Lawrenceville, N.J., and four grandchildren.</p>
