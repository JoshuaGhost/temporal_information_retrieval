        <p>LEAD: When people who have children get a divorce and remarry, special care needs to be taken in financial and estate planning - particularly if the new spouse also has children from a previous marriage.</p>
        <p>When people who have children get a divorce and remarry, special care needs to be taken in financial and estate planning - particularly if the new spouse also has children from a previous marriage.</p>
        <p>''You've got his, hers and ours,'' said Herbert Paul, who as senior tax partner of Mahoney Cohen Paul &amp; Company in New York, often counsels people on estate planning. ''The original children often tend to get short-changed.''</p>
        <p>Some men feel resentful about their divorces and any court-ordered payments for alimony or child support, he said. Consequently, ''the former family may not have all the luxuries he's bestowing on the new family,'' nor will they be treated equally in the will, he added.</p>
        <p>Following conventional estate planning rules, husbands and wives generally leave the bulk of their estates to each other, and if they die without a will, state laws that favor spouses come into play.</p>
        <p>There are common sense reasons for this. When children are young, the surviving spouse will be responsible for the family, and when children are grown and presumably self-sufficient the surviving spouse may need assets for retirement. And there are important tax reasons to leave the bulk to a spouse on estates of more than $600,000 because there are no estate taxes on bequests to a surviving spouse. Otherwise on large estates, taxes can be as high as 55 percent.</p>
        <p>But in the case of second or third marriages, leaving everything to the spouse can leave children from the first marriage out in the cold.</p>
        <p>Tamara Telesko, vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and a lawyer who advises the bank's private banking customers on personal finances, said such problems sometimes occurred when older men remarried, choosing women in the same age range as their children.</p>
        <p>The young wife is likely to survive the husband, inherit everything and remarry, perhaps having another family she will favor in her will.</p>
        <p>This can lead to a particularly nettlesome situation if there is a family business and the adult children find they are working for the new, young wife who is not involved in it. One possible solution would be to purchase insurance to provide for the wife and to give control of the business to the children who are working in it.</p>
        <p>A key way to avoid problems, Ms. Telesko said, is through trusts, making sure everyone has been provided for. Using a QTIP trust, which stands for qualified terminable interest property, one spouse can give the other all income from the property for life and direct that the property pass to the children upon the spouse's death.</p>
        <p>This makes sure that the property goes to his children, she said, instead of to her family by a subsequent marriage. No estate taxes are due on the property in a QTIP trust until the second spouse dies.</p>
        <p>In some instances, Mr. Paul said, there may be reason not to treat children equally. For example, if some are grown and self-sufficient but another is still in school, or if one is in a remunerative position but another is in an idealistic but low-paying job, or if one has special medical needs.</p>
        <p>In those cases, he advised writing in the will, ''I love all my children equally, but'' and explaining the reasons for favoring one financially. The mention of love and the explanation can go a long way to overcome injured feelings, he said. So can a frank family discussion of estate plans in advance.</p>
        <p>Gerald Morlitz, a lawyer with the Cowan Financial Group in New York and an expert on estate planning, recommended that prenuptial agreements be used whenever divorced people with children remarry, particularly when there is some degree of wealth. ''The sad fact is, few do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many do not even think about adopting their new spouse's children and naming new guardians for their children in their wills, he added. They just refer to ''my children,'' without legally adopting them. ''Then if the wife predeceases the husband, guardianship goes to the natural father, and the family is broken,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Or bitterness may develop because family members have made different assumptions about how the estate will be divided but have never discussed them.</p>
        <p>''There is no hostility like family hostility,'' Mr. Morlitz said. ''It really gets bitter.'' The best way to avoid family problems over money is ''full disclosure in advance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Family members should sit down together and think through everyone's needs, and think generally of how they are to be met in the family's financial and estate plans, possibly with professional advice. Then they should see a lawyer who specializes in trusts and estates to write a will that would not be subject to challenge under state law and set up any trusts needed to carry out the estate plan.</p>
