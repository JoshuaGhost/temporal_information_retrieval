        <p>LEAD: Beach Boys USA, one of four America's Cup defense syndicates licensed for the 1992 trial race series in San Diego, has joined a French challenger in a collaborative move that is unprecedented in America's Cup history.</p>
        <p>First Boat in Water</p>
        <p>The French yacht, whose sail number will change from F1 to US-1, will become the first United States defense boat in the water for the 1992 cup series. The yacht is likely to produce substantial gains for the Beach Boys team, which will be able to train its crew and use the yacht as a test model for constructing its own boat.</p>
        <p>No other American groups plan to launch their first boat until next spring. Most plan to build two or three models, the fastest of which will sail in the cup trials.</p>
        <p>The new America's Cup yachts, which are about 10 feet longer than the traditional 12-Meters formerly used in cup competition, cost more than $2 million apiece to construct. Rules for cup racing require that the final race boats be designed and built in the country they represent. The Beach Boys team cannot race US-1 in the trial series, but they can use it to improve their own design.</p>
        <p>There have been informal attempts among yachting syndicates in the last decade to cooperate with each other. But the lines between challenger and defender have never crossed to this extent.</p>
        <p>Cup Spirit</p>
        <p>''I think that this sort of cooperation between a challenger team and a defense team in this early stage of the cup program reinforces the basic spirit of the America's Cup,'' John Bertrand, the Beach Boys skipper, said last week from Sardinia, where he was racing.</p>
        <p>David Lowry, the chairman of the Beach Boys syndicate, said in a recent telephone interview that buying the new boat has turned out to be a good deal for both sides. The sale came at a time when the French, sponsored by the Yacht Club de France of Paris, were reportedly short of funds.</p>
        <p>''It takes the American effort from being at a disadvantage, to being closer to a level with other challengers,'' said Lowry, whose team has a $25 million budget.</p>
        <p>Marc Pajot, France's experienced America's Cup skipper, plans to send four of his crew members and two maintenance technicians to San Diego with F1 this December. He will sail periodically with the Beach Boys crew.</p>
        <p>Conner Impressed</p>
        <p>Dennis Conner said last month in an interview that the French boat appeared to be fast upwind. Based on the boat's limited performance since it was launched in France last March, Conner predicted that the French team would be one of four finalists in the challengers' trial races in San Diego. ''I have a lot of respect for the French designers,'' Conner said. Of the 11 international teams committed to racing, three have launched their first boats: France, one yacht, F1; and Italy and Japan, two boats each.</p>
        <p>The Beach Boys' announcement comes at a time when other United States syndicates are considering a plan to regroup. William Koch, a yachtsman from Palm Beach, Fla., has discussed creating a new defense syndicate with the aid of Buddy Melges, skipper for the Yankee Syndicate of Cleveland, and Larry Klein, helmsman for Triumph America, a group from San Diego.</p>
        <p>If accepted, the reorganization could leave three United States defense teams: Beach Boys USA, Team Dennis Conner, and a Koch syndicate. Peter Isler of San Diego withdrew from his defense effort because of lack of money last month. Other unlicensed defense groups are still struggling for official acceptance.</p>
