        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Rules of the Game: Inertia and Force'' (Week in Review, Sept. 2), a geographic-historical graphic on the Arab world, you describe Iraq as ''awarded to Britain'' under a League of Nations mandate after World War I. It was the British who fashioned Iraq out of Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, three vilayets, or provinces of the Ottoman Empire. And what a poor design it turned out to be.</p>
        <p>Sir Arnold Wilson, acting civil commissioner in Mesopotamia in 1917, summarized the British position: ''the idea of Iraq as an independent nation had scarcely taken shape, for the country lacked homogeneity, whether geographical, economic or racial . . . it was scarcely to be hoped that the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad could maintain their existence as an autonomous state without the revenue it was hoped might eventually be derived from the economic resources of the Mosul vilayet.''</p>
        <p>The ''economic resources'' of Mosul were vast petroleum deposits in the region of Kirkuk. Unlike Basra and Baghdad, which were predominantly Arab provinces, Mosul was in Kurdish territory, as maps drawn by the Royal Geographic Society in 1910 clearly indicate. According to the Iraqi census of 1922-24, the population of the Mosul vilayet consisted of 494,007 Kurds and 166,941 Arabs. But fully anticipating control over the oil reserves under a League of Nations mandate, the British pressed for incorporation of the predominantly Kurdish province into what was to become a state dominated by Arabs. The British Government even imported a Hashemite sheik from the Arabian Peninsula to become king of the new Iraq.</p>
        <p>Thus, the British set the stage for what was to become a chronic cycle of Kurdish uprisings and Arab repression. In the same way the British engineered the creation of Kuwait when it was discovered that beneath the sands at the tip of the province of Basra there lay a wealth of oil. Seen in this light, Saddam Hussein's annexation of Kuwait is a vastly inferior version of an earlier British model.</p>
        <p>Now with Britain running close behind, the United States steps into the picture bringing to bear its full force of arms to keep an Arab despot from executing his own crude plot to control the oil in the region he still calls Basra. A centerpiece of the strategy of Britain and the United States is an embargo on food and medical supplies to the Iraqi people - although if Iraq is the dictatorship we all know it to be, the people of Iraq, Arabs and Kurds alike, are all its victims. What price oil, in whose name precious distinctions between democracies and dictatorships are continually eroded?</p>
