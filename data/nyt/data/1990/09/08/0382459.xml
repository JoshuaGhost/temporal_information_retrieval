        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The empowerment of local community groups through community action agencies ultimately created a backlash in political establishments around the country, which set about to dismantle them. I am delighted that a conservative embraces the concept of empowerment, but hope he understands the forces unleashed when previously disenfranchised people start marching on city hall for a fair share of the nation's resources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler states that ''generous assistance to the able-bodied'' promotes ''socially and economically destructive behavior.'' If he refers to cash assistance, it has never been generous. If to efforts to improve early education, health care and job training, the record shows that improved services improve chances for a successful climb out of poverty.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Butler speaks of welfare programs in which a ''family is eligible for help only if a working father is not at home,'' he seems unaware that these strictures were developed decades ago by a coalition of Southern Democratic conservatives and Republicans. It is encouraging that a conservative has realized the folly of this approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler urges on President Bush a ''conservative war on poverty,'' based on work, family, decentralization and empowerment. I support him fully, though he does not recognize that we tried it in the 1960's, and it worked! The problem was that it was ill supported then ($2.5 million a year for the Office of Economic Opportunity) and it certainly didn't last long enough.</p>
