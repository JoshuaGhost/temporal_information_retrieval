        <p>LEAD: More than 6,000 coal miners are on strike for higher pay in southern Poland, and the Finance Minister met today with a delegation of miners to discuss their demands, according to the official press agency.</p>
        <p>More than 6,000 coal miners are on strike for higher pay in southern Poland, and the Finance Minister met today with a delegation of miners to discuss their demands, according to the official press agency.</p>
        <p>Workers were striking at the Czerwone Zaglebie and Niwka Modrzejow mines near the industrial city of Katowice, 185 miles south of Warsaw, PAP reported. All 6,000 workers stayed off the job today at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine, and another 40 continued their strike at Niwka Modrzejow.</p>
        <p>But miners at two other locations near Walbrzych, a city 12 miles from the border with Czechoslovakia, suspended their strike because of the talks, the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said.</p>
        <p>A delegation of workers met with the Finance Minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, in the morning in Warsaw, a spokesman for Mr. Balcerowicz, said. He said details of the talks were not immediately available.</p>
        <p>The miners' main demand is higher pay, and the strike is the biggest over wages since the Government announced drastic measures to introduce a market economy on Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Mine strikes late in the summer of 1988 led to widespread labor unrest that forced the Communist authorities, who ruled at the time, to start talks on political reform.</p>
