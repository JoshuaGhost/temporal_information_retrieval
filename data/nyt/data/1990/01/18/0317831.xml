        <p>LEAD: Republican leaders have begun a subtle operation to recast their party's approach to abortion in the 1990 elections, and the effort is already stirring concern in the party's anti-abortion wing.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders have begun a subtle operation to recast their party's approach to abortion in the 1990 elections, and the effort is already stirring concern in the party's anti-abortion wing.</p>
        <p>By shifting to a new emphasis on the diversity of Republican views on abortion, and by helping candidates address the issue better on the stump regardless of their positions, top Republican strategists hope to avoid the damage suffered by Republican candidates over the issue in 1989.</p>
        <p>But some anti-abortion Republicans are beginning to sound alarms, seeing worrisome trends in the party's tactical maneuvering.</p>
        <p>Party Chiefs Are Challenged</p>
        <p>''If you go around saying our party is big enough for people no matter what their view on abortion, I think you signal that it's not an important issue.'' asserts Gary Bauer, a longtime abortion opponent and leading voice for traditional family values who was domestic policy adviser in the White House of Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>''We would not go around saying that the party is big enough for people who want to raise Federal income taxes, and we would not go around saying the party is big enough for people who want to gut the defense budget,'' said Mr. Bauer, who is challenging the party's self-portrait as a ''big tent.''</p>
        <p>Republican leaders are wary of openly discussing these efforts because they are straddling a fault line, between the powerful anti-abortion forces in their party and the desire of many Republicans to reach out to voters who support abortion rights.</p>
        <p>These tensions are apparent as members of the Republican National Committee gather in Washington on Thursday for their mid-winter meeting, their first since the party's losses in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, where the abortion issue figured prominently.</p>
        <p>Since last summer's Supreme Court decision giving states new power to restrict abortion, and particularly since the November elections, the party has sent a number of signals of political reassessment, with the tacit approval of the White House, Republican strategists said.</p>
        <p>Atwater Carries the Message</p>
        <p>Lee Atwater, the national party chairman, has traveled around the country telling Republicans and the public that his party is ''a big enough tent'' to hold differing views on abortion. President Bush, while reiterating his own formal opposition to abortion, has campaiged for several Republican candidates who are supporters of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>And some leaders of the anti-abortion movement have been told that while Mr. Bush and Mr. Atwater remain opposed to abortion, party leaders would be emphasizing the party's inclusiveness.</p>
        <p>Party strategists have conducted interviews in Virginia to help them understand how the issue played in that state's 1989 gubernatorial election, and to help them deal with it better in 1990.</p>
        <p>A White House official asserted today, ''There's less here than meets the eye.'' Indeed, Republican officials are careful to note that there has been no substantive change in the party's position on abortion; its platform commits the party to overturning the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. And Mr. Bush is expected to speak by telephone hookup to abortion opponents Monday, when they rally here to protest that Supreme Court decision on its anniversary.</p>
        <p>Shift Is Dismissed by Some</p>
        <p>Many anti-abortion leaders dismiss the notion that any meaningful shift is occurring in the party. They emphasize that the party's official doctrine has not changed and underscore their faith in Mr. Bush and his chief of staff, John Sununu, a strong abortion opponent.</p>
        <p>''There's no way people are going to change George Bush's position, there's no way you can change the party platform now, so it really doesn't matter what Lee Atwater says,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative leader. ''I think Lee is 100 percent loyal to Bush and he's smart enough to know the elements of Bush's success.''</p>
        <p>Representative Vin Weber, Republican of Minnesota, who also opposes abortion, said he was puzzled by Mr. Atwater's remarks about making the party inclusive, rather than exclusive on the abortion issue. ''I like Lee, but I don't understand what he's getting at.''</p>
        <p>These internal tensions are likely to grow this election year, in the view of some politicians and analysts, because several major Republican races are expected to be waged by candidates who support abortion rights, including the Senate races in Illinois and Rhode Island and the gubernatorial races in Pennsylvania, California and Illinois.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to see what's going to be in it for right-to-lifers to support a pro-choice Republican whose victory would set their own cause back,'' said Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst.</p>
        <p>Tension in Pennsylvania Race</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, the politics are particularly complex. The Republican candidate, Auditor General Barbara Hafer, who supports abortion rights, is expected to run against Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat who opposes abortion.</p>
        <p>The state Republican chairman, State Senator Earl M. Baker, said there was ''a good deal'' of tension over Ms. Hafer's candidacy because of the abortion issue. But Mr. Baker, noting that he personally opposes abortion, added, ''If a party can't be diverse, it's not going to be successful.''</p>
        <p>Some Republicans are already predicting a struggle over the party's platform in 1992; some Republicans have long hoped for a position on abortion that emphasizes a woman's right to choose. Mr. Atwater dismisses such speculation, but refuses to fully discuss the issue. ''I'm not willing to address the party platform this far in advance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Advise Is Called Tactical</p>
        <p>Mr. Atwater and other Republican officials say they are focusing largely on tactical advice to candidates, arguing that their research indicates the way a candidate handles abortion is more critical than whether they support or oppose abortion rights. ''More important than your actual position on abortion is that you're not perceived or seen as flip-flopping on the issue,'' Mr. Atwater says.</p>
        <p>Mary Matalin, chief of staff at the Republican National Committee, added, ''Our immediate concern is to not let this be a dominating issue the way it was in 1989.'' She said the party's interviews with Virginia voters after the election indicated that voters did not want abortion to be the main campaign issue.</p>
        <p>Democrats are amused by the Republican efforts, and assert that Mr. Bush is campaigning for people who would be denied appointments in his Administration because of their position on abortion.</p>
        <p>''The big tent that allows only one type of employee is not our idea of a big tent,'' said Paul Tully, political director at the Democratic National Committee. ''It's more like big lie.''</p>
