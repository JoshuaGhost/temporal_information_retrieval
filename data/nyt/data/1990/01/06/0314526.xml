        <p>LEAD: The Pacific Standard Life Insurance Company, a carrier with $7 billion of insurance in force that had invested heavily in ''junk bonds'' and ''junk mortgages,'' was declared insolvent by the California Department of Insurance at the end of November. In the weeks since then, many financial advisers have asked whether the insolvency is an isolated event or whether other insurers are also at risk.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Standard Life Insurance Company, a carrier with $7 billion of insurance in force that had invested heavily in ''junk bonds'' and ''junk mortgages,'' was declared insolvent by the California Department of Insurance at the end of November. In the weeks since then, many financial advisers have asked whether the insolvency is an isolated event or whether other insurers are also at risk.</p>
        <p>The question is an important one to consumers. Not only do people buy life insurance to protect their families, but in recent years many people have also bought annuities and other insurance products with investment components.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, pension plans invest with insurers. And some 65 percent of the assets in 401(k) retirement savings plans - $150 billion - are in guaranteed investment contracts, or G.I.C.'s, which are fixed-income investments offered by insurance companies.</p>
        <p>''However, contrary to popular belief, the only guarantee is the full faith and credit of the insurance company issuing the contract,'' said J. Ben Vernazza, chairman of the investment policy committee of IMS/CPA's &amp; Associates, in Aptos, Calif., a firm that advises other certified public accountants who do fee-only financial planning.</p>
        <p>Still, there is no simple answer to the risk question. If there is an expert consensus, it is that consumers should take care in selecting insurance carriers, looking at the company's financial stability, not simply at premium cost of the yield it pays on an annuity, for example.</p>
        <p>''I would be very concerned about the insurance companies,'' said Gerald Morlitz, a lawyer and director of Arthur Andersen &amp; Company's personal financial planning group in New York. ''I think it's the savings and loans five years deferred without any bailout. Make sure it's a healthy company or get out.'' Among the companies he views as healthy are Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance, Guardian Life Insurance and New England Life.</p>
        <p>''There is definitely a place for insurance,'' Mr. Vernazza said, ''but we tend to use it specifically for what it is - protection against risk, not as an investment vehicle.'' He added that ''problems are just starting to surface with the insurance companies'' and he would avoid certain companies, including some large ones because of their junk bond holdings and shaky real estate. ''Junk bonds were accurately named from the start,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Brian Ternoey, an actuary who is head of the investment services practice of Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm, is far more sanguine. He sees no real credit risk among insurers and cautions against overreaction.</p>
        <p>''Some carriers are heavily invested in junk bonds and junk real estate, but they are not at the breaking point yet,'' he said. ''The heaviest can survive for several years with no real default problems.'' Even Executive Life, a company often cited for its junk bond portfolio, also has a lot of United States Treasuries, he noted.</p>
        <p>Terence Lennon, chief examiner for life insurance at the New York Insurance Department, agreed. ''There is no immediate danger with the companies pension plans are likely to deal with,'' he said. But, he added that ''the environment in which life insurance companies operate has changed dramatically in the last 15 years.'' Where the greatest risk in the past was mortality, it is now investment risk, he said.</p>
        <p>Insurers invest primarily in corporate and government bonds, commercial and residential mortgages, real estate and common stock. The industry's asset quality is high relative to other financial institutions, Moody's Investment Service says, but over the years some insurers have made more risky investments in junk bonds and mortgages as competition for yields has increased. Indeed, insurance companies own 30 percent of the junk bonds outstanding and pension funds own 15 percent.</p>
        <p>It is in assessing the degree of risk that financial professionals differ. A number of factors must be considered, including the diversification of a portfolio, economic and market outlook, a company's underwriting standards and accounting standards used in reporting assets and liabilities.</p>
        <p>In the case of Pacific Standard, which is owned by the Southmark Corporation of Dallas, California regulators, using conservative accounting standards, disallowed millions of dollars in assets claimed by the insurer. Most were in stock, mortgages and real estate, not in its junk bonds, although the state wants the company to move into less risky investments. Southmark itself has filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>The company is continuing to pay death benefits and annuity payments but has imposed a six-month moratorium to prevent policy holders from cashing out their policies.</p>
        <p>''Don't panic,'' Mr. Ternoey advised investors in general. Pension plans are administered by employers, he noted, but employees can approach 401(k) plans with something other than benign neglect because most plans offer employees a choice of investments.</p>
        <p>Most people should put more of their 401(k) funds in stocks and less in fixed-income investments, both Mr. Ternoey and Mr. Morlitz said, because historically, over the longer term, stocks have outperformed other assets.</p>
