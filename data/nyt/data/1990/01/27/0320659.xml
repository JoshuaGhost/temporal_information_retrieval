        <p>LEAD: Dr. Veronica Prego's tragic dispute with New York City has been billed as a ''$175 million lawsuit.''

        <p>Dr. Veronica Prego's tragic dispute with New York City has been billed as a ''$175 million lawsuit.'' It's been that way ever since someone added up all the dollars in her original complaint that the city's negligence, in leaving a contaminated needle on a hospital bed, caused her to contract AIDS. As the legal world knows, such figures mean nothing. Plaintiffs can usually win damages whether or not amounts are specified in their civil complaints.</p>
        <p>Such dollar demands do have theatrical value, however, so years ago, doctors and municipalities persuaded the New York Legislature to forbid specific dollar amounts in medical malpractice suits or suits against localities. On New York City's motion, those numbers have been stricken from Dr. Prego's amended complaint. Should she win her suit, the jury will be asked to calculate damages on a reasonable basis.</p>
        <p>The law is a breeding ground for gross exaggerations. Lawyers sing, ''This case is going all the way to the Supreme Court'' even when they have no hope of getting there. ''Noriega faces 145 years,'' the news reports say, adding up the maximum penalties in all the counts against Panama's former leader. In his case, such melodrama is a harmless irrelevance. In Dr. Prego's poignant case, it is an offensive distraction.</p>
