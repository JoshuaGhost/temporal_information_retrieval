        <p>LEAD: She put up with her job as chief of radiology at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan for too long. Then she worked hard to make her private practice go. All the while, she took care of the house, her husband and her two children, now in their teens, and had not ''done a thing for this old body for a long time.</p>
        <p>She put up with her job as chief of radiology at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan for too long. Then she worked hard to make her private practice go. All the while, she took care of the house, her husband and her two children, now in their teens, and had not ''done a thing for this old body for a long time.''</p>
        <p>So there was Dr. Annette Brown last Tuesday night at the 92d Street Y signing up for classes in sculpture and modern dance. ''The New Year came and I decided that if I die I would be very angry that I never took the time to do something for myself,'' Ms. Brown said.</p>
        <p>After the excesses of the holiday season, New York is awash with people who have decided it is time to improve mind and body. In what has become a rite of winter, thousands of people are registering by phone, fax machine, mail and in person at the city's universities, museums and non-traditional schools for adult education classes that run the gamut from modern European philosophy to the sex lives of honey ants.</p>
        <p>The draw of taking a course is particularly strong in the January doldrums, when resolutions for the New Year still ring clear in the mind.</p>
        <p>'Improving Your Situation'</p>
        <p>''During the holidays people tend to get more depressed and miss things like not having a mate,'' said Dr. James Thomas, a psychotherapist, as he sat in the front row of a lecture at the Learning Annex on how to find a mate. ''You then combine that with the idea of New Year's resolutions that revolve around improving your situation by enhancing your knowledge or learning new skills.''</p>
        <p>But beyond the idea of renewal, taking evening classes seems to be to New York what skiing is to Denver and surfing to Hawaii. ''In the New York area it's really a way of life,'' said Sara Gilbert, public relations coordinator for New York University's School of Continuing Education. ''If you just go to work and go home, people wonder what's wrong with you. Going to school is what New Yorkers do.''</p>
        <p>And they do it by the thousands. According to Ms. Gilbert, 15,000 to 20,000 people sign up for noncredit adult classes for N.Y.U.'s spring semester. A few blocks away, some 18,000 people generally register for spring courses at the New School, the other heavyweight in the adult education field.</p>
        <p>In keeping with their size, the New School and N.Y.U. offer more than 2,000 courses each, and employ full-time staffs that are constantly assessing the popularity of current classes and thinking up ideas for new ones. On average, 25 percent of the course offerings at the New School and N.Y.U. are canceled before the semester begins for lack of students. ''If it doesn't fly, we don't keep it,'' Ms. Gilbert said.</p>
        <p>Specialized Niches for Museums</p>
        <p>More modest programs are offered by the city's museums, which seek to find specialized niches in the scramble for students. This winter the American Museum of Natural History will feature 18 lecture series on historical, ecological and anthropological topics. One, entitled ''Bees Above, Ants Below,'' explores the behavior of bees and the honey ants of the western United States and Central America.</p>
        <p>''Did you know that there are 21,000 species of bees?'' asked Dr. Malcolm Arth, chairman and curator of the museum's education department.</p>
        <p>Still, the most popular courses seem to be less esoteric. With a week of registration to go, the New School has already filled some of the classes in its series ''Behind the Scenes at the Great Restaurants of New York.'' The course takes students into the kitchens of restaurants like the Sign of the Dove and the Russian Tea Room, where they meet the chefs and sample house specialties.</p>
        <p>Celebrities in Academia</p>
        <p>Computer courses remain popular, as do almost any classes or lectures that allow students to rub shoulders with celebrities. The New School has already filled its class on ''Hamlet,'' which includes a backstage visit to the Public Theater and possibly a chat with Kevin Kline, the play's star. The class begins on April 25, after the new production opens. Maryanne Reilly, producer of the ''About Women'' series at the 92d Street Y, is confident that her planned evening with the playwright Wendy Wasserstein will be a sellout.</p>
        <p>Motives for taking evening classes vary greatly. Cheryl Novak, director of technical services for a printing company, signed up for computerized desktop publishing to stay abreast of technological changes in her field. Besides, she said, her employer is paying for it. Mr. Thomas, the psychotherapist, said he wanted to learn some tips he could pass along to his patients, many of whom are women seeking relationships.</p>
        <p>But for some, the social aspects of evening school weigh as heavily as what is learned. Roslyn Hodes, a systems analyst, and Ann Goldwater, a labor lawyer, have been friends since childhood. But their schedules rarely leave them time to get together. Both have enrolled in a course called ''Accounting for Jewish Survival'' at the 92d Street Y. ''This way we know we'll see each other at least once a week,'' Ms. Hodes said.</p>
