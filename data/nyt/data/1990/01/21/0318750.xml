        <p>LEAD: Mitchell R. Cutler began selling books many years ago when he was working for an art collector. ''I like doing this and think I could do it, so why not?'' he recalled asking himself.</p>
        <p>Mitchell R. Cutler began selling books many years ago when he was working for an art collector. ''I like doing this and think I could do it, so why not?'' he recalled asking himself.</p>
        <p>At the time it meant rummaging through thrift shops and old bookstores. ''In the beginning I bought anything at all that was art-related,'' said the 38-year-old dealer, who was born in Rockville Centre, L.I. ''Eventually, I zeroed in to American art and modern design.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutler, who works out of a neatly cluttered walk-up apartment hidden away in Manhattan's garment district, sells books with prices that range from $25 to $20,000. The ''Atlas Celeste,'' a collection of 52 maps published in 1762, is the most expensive of his books, ''out of my field but so exquisite, I had to buy it,'' Mr. Cutler said.</p>
        <p>''They're hand-colored etchings.'' At the moment, he said, the book is out on consignment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutler, who specializes in books about art and design from 1860 to 1960, does a lot of his business over the telephone, at antiques shows and small book fairs. ''I'm good at American art,'' he said, ''but no one has the breadth of my inventory on modern design.''</p>
        <p>But books are only one of his interests. For years he has collected modern glass, and he recently began buying post-World War II radios. ''I started after I saw someone else's collection,'' he said. ''I've paid from $10 to $250 for the radios. When I get a hundred of them, then I might start selling them.''</p>
        <p>He might also run out of space, but right now there are still a few feet to spare near the numerous prints, mostly those depicting people at work, as well as above an Art Deco-style console. ''That's actually a footboard of a bed that I found on the street and hung upside down,'' he explained. ''I love designer garbage.''</p>
