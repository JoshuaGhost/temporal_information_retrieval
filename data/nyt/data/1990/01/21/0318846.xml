        <p>LEAD: TO understand how much mountain there is to ski at Whistler Resort in British Columbia, imagine taking a chairlift from the floor of Manhattan to a point nearly four times the height of the World Trade Center. From the apex of one of Whistler Resort's twin peaks, about a mile above the base, a skier can glide for days and never cover the same run twice.</p>
        <p>TO understand how much mountain there is to ski at Whistler Resort in British Columbia, imagine taking a chairlift from the floor of Manhattan to a point nearly four times the height of the World Trade Center. From the apex of one of Whistler Resort's twin peaks, about a mile above the base, a skier can glide for days and never cover the same run twice.</p>
        <p>This vertical abundance - said to be the greatest drop of any ski resort in North America - has long been the private treasure of winter sports enthusiasts in the Pacific Northwest. The resort, 70 miles north of Vancouver, and a half day's drive from Seattle, was known as the place for skiers with short attention spans; there was just so much terrain to cover, so many powder bowls to discover, meadows to float through and steep chutes to scoot down, that Whistler could make good skiers out of mediocre ones.</p>
        <p>Tucked in the green folds of the Coast Range, a spine of peaks that rise from the sea along the western edge of Canada, Whistler had a reputation as an oversized mountain in an undeveloped area. War stories were told about the hidden runs through the forest and the treacherous drive home on a pock-marked, winding road above the fjords of Howe Sound.</p>
        <p>But starting in 1980, and especially over the last three years, the resort went big time. A European-styled town, somewhat Bavarian-looking with exposed-beam structures surrounding a brick-tiled town square, was built at the base of Whistler and its twin peak, Blackcomb Mountain. The town, formerly Alta Lake, was commissioned in 1980 by the province as the Resort Municipality of Whistler. It is named for the hoary marmot, a fur-ball of a mountain mammal whose piercing whistle echoes through the high alpine areas of the Northwest during the warm months.</p>
        <p>Over the last nine years, Whister has been under almost constant construction. Condominiums and stone castles and stucco-walled hotels came to the village. Blackcomb Mountain, once a skier's frontier accessible only by helicopter or hiking, was cut and groomed. The developers built sealed gondolas and express chairlifts to speed skiers up the length of the two peaks. It used to take 45 minutes to a series of chairlifts from the base to the summits of the twin peaks; now it takes about half that time to get to the top.</p>
        <p>And now, Whistler seems to have come of age. It still has everything going for it - abundant snow, averaging 450 inches a year; the 5,300 feet of vertical drop; nearly 200 ski runs on both mountains - but it is no longer the private playground of skiers from the cities of the Northwest.</p>
        <p>This is not a quaint alpine village. The town of Whistler Village, built compactly, has more than 2,000 hotel rooms; on a typical weekend, most of them are full, and many guests hail from Japan or Taiwan or Hawaii. Just before the start of this winter season, Ski Magazine polled 100 outdoor writers on the best ski resorts in North America. Vail, in Colorado, ranked first. Whistler was second.</p>
        <p>Because of its vast terrain, Whistler has a blend of snow: heavier and compact in the lower elevations, fluffy and deep up high. The runs on the upper reaches of Blackcomb and Whistler Mountains usually are paved with powder, where a skier can cut fresh tracks in the high alpine zone, a sensation similiar to that of helicopter skiing. The deepest, steepest and most exhilarating are on the north-side glaciers of both mountains, just off the summits. If that doesn't satisfy, heli-skiing on the untouched peaks of the Coast Range is available out of Whistler.</p>
        <p>In November, Chateau Whistler, a $45 million castle that is perhaps the grandest of the resort's new hotels, opened. Its owners, Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts, call it the largest resort hotel built in Canada since the turn of the century. As grand in concept as the company's stone palace at Banff and its chateau at Lake Louise, both in the Canadian Rockies, Chateau Whistler could become the centerpiece of apres-ski life in the Coast Range. At least during the first days the hotel was open, some quirks - construction sounds, the smell of new paint, service operations yet to gel - remained to be worked out, but its location 20 paces from the express chairlift up Blackcomb Mountain, just outside the main village of Whistler, is unbeatable.</p>
        <p>Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resort, an arm of the railroad company that connected the vast western provinces of Canada to its eastern capitals, has long had a tradition of building elegant hotels in enchanted, wild settings. Whistler is no longer wild, with the stench of from pulp mills down the valley occasionally drifting up to the resort area, and timber companies clear-cutting whole flanks of Coast Range mountains, but it remains enchanted.</p>
        <p>There is, to start with, the road, a 70-mile link of pavement from bustling Vancouver to Whistler. Once a major horror, Highway 99 has been cleverly named by the province the Sea to Sky Highway; its worst turns have been straightened, and most potholes from logging trucks are filled in. The drive from Vancouver takes a pleasant 90 minutes. The maritime climate of coastal British Columbia is almost always mild, with light rain, mist or finicky clouds The fjords and glacier peaks rising from islands in the sound remind some visitors of Norway. Alternatives are the train, bus or helicopter service from Vancouver, all of which make daily runs to Whistler.</p>
        <p>Both mountains are served by Whistler Village, where cars are parked, hotels clustered, and lifts based. A single lift ticket provides access to both peaks. The older, more established ski area is Whistler Mountain, with its bowls and glacier skiing from the 7,160-foot summit, its gentle descents and trails through deep forests. Fifty-five percent of its runs are listed as intermediate, the rest evenly divided between expert and beginner, about the same as Blackcomb Mountain.</p>
        <p>Whistler Mountain is served by seven double chairlifts, three triple chairs, one quad chair and 4- and 10-person gondolas. Several of these lifts are called express, which means they move twice as fast as the old-fashioned chairs. With the addition of a new gondola last season, Whistler can move more than 20,000 skiers an hour up the mountain. But even with the improvements, it still takes a combination of gondola and chair to get from the base to the very top. Of course, you can ski the lower runs and never worry about the snow at higher elevations. However, a run at the end of the day from top to base is a great treat: nonstop descent for nearly half an hour for the average skier.</p>
        <p>Blackcomb, because it is newer, more groomed and less forested, seems to be an easier mountain to ski. The runs are wide, with fewer trails through the trees, and fewer bumps. There are two glacier bowls at the top. But the best summit skiing is off the Seventh Heaven express chair, facing south. Here, a skier can cut curves in fresh powder or find open bowls beneath the chair. A summit house, called Horstman Hut, serves hot chocolate, coffee, beer and soft drinks, plus knackwurst, bratwurst and chili; on clear days the view over a sea of peaks is unmatched in the Coast Range.</p>
        <p>Blackcomb, which can move 23,850 skiers an hour, has added a fourth express chairlift this season. It now has 1 double chair, 5 triple lifts and 4 four-person chairs, one with protective cover that shields skiers from wind and snow. That lift begins just outside the Chateau Whistler.</p>
        <p>Blackcomb is nicely divided between maniac ski runs with a scare factor somewhat like the steeper chutes of Snowbird in Utah, and terrain where the family can learn from each other. It is not a daredevil mountain, but there is usually one genuinely challenging route off the upper chairs that serve most of the intermediate runs. Computer-controlled signs advise skiers how long a wait to expect at each lift and the depth of new snow received at various places on the mountain. Lift lines are practically nonexistent during the week, but a skier can wait 15 minutes or more to board a chair on busy weekends.</p>
        <p>CROSS-COUNTRY skiers will find 15 miles of groomed trails just outside Whistler Village. Usually, the better terrain, more peaceful and open, with deeper snow, is 20 minutes south of Whistler, where more than 30 miles of cross-country trails lace the lower valley.</p>
        <p>The snow can be iffy in the lower valleys, but higher up, for downhill skiiers on the upper runs of Whistler, there is no shortage. The normal downhill ski season runs from late November to late April or early May. However, there is limited skiing on the glaciers year-round. Summer skiing in the morning and golf or fishing in the afternoon is a singular treat at Whistler.</p>
        <p>There is no night skiing at either mountain. But Whistler Village, with its 35 resort hotels and dozens of restaurants and nightclubs, comes alive after dark. Food ranges from family fare, pizza on the run or baskets of chicken, to fresh Northwest seafood. An oyster bar and several Italian restaurants operated by some of Vancouver's better chefs are in the village.</p>
        <p>Chateau Whistler hired the chef Bernard Casavant away from the Four Seasons in Vancouver; his selections, served in a buffet inside the hotel's Wildflower Cafe, are an attempt to get away from standard hotel fare. He uses local raw materials - the salmon, scallops, squid, venison, mussels, berries and herbs from British Columbia's coast - in hearty combinations. There is nothing nouvelle about his buffet, or the a la carte menus offered in other rooms.</p>
        <p>The hotel itself, 350 rooms on a perch connected by a trail about five minutes walk to Whistler Village (there is also a shuttle bus), is designed like a big country mansion. Stonemasons not being what they were at the turn of the century, when the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise were built, the Chateau does not have the look of other Canadian Pacific hotels, which seem to have taken decades to build. However, it is solid and original, with hand-stenciled designs on the arched ceilings, oversized oak leaves on the walls in the main ballroom, and a wall-sized stone fireplace near the main lobby. Most rooms are somewhat small, but well furnished.  There are few hidden nooks and rocking chairs for afternoon reading. But a stroller in search of diversion within the 290,000 square feet of the Chateau Whistler will find Canadian folk art - doll houses, bird cages and the kind of old wooden toys that nobody makes anymore - throughout the hotel. The Mallard Bar is intimate, with a terrific view of the slopes. And the huge pool, which is partly indoors and is connected to an outside wing, allows the swimmer to pass between the two worlds. On clear nights, when the stars provide just enough light to outline the twin peaks, Whistler has a charm that makes the hoary marmot almost loveable.</p>
        <p>AROUND THE TWO PEAKS</p>
        <p>The Ski Areas</p>
        <p>A one-day adult lift ticket for Whistler Mountain (604-932-3434) only is $32 (prices in United States dollars at 1.11 Canadian dollars to one United States dollar), as is one for Blackcomb Mountain (604-932-3141). A ticket good for both areas is $34 for one day and $100 for three days. Children under 6 ski free.</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Most major airlines, Delta, United, Continental and American among them, fly from American cities to Vancouver. From there, Whistler is a 90-minute drive. From Seattle, the drive is about four hours. B.C. Rail (604-984-5246) runs daily train service between Vancouver and Whistler price; a round trip costs $21.. Maverick Coach Lines (604-255-1171) offers bus runs several times a day, for $19 round trip. Bus and train trips take about two and a half hours in each direction.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>At Whistler, reservations at more than 50 hotels, condominums and guesthouses can be made by calling a central number, 800-634-9622 or 604-932-4222.</p>
        <p>Chateau Whistler (800-828-7447 or 604-938-8000) has a variety of rooms and prices, ranging from $150 for a small double room, to $495 for a two-bedroom suite. Discounts for longer stays are available.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in Whistler Village, Carleton Lodge (604-932-4183) has spacious condominium units just off the chairlifts, with daily prices for a one-bedroom unit going for $149 and $167.</p>
        <p>Away from the village but within a few minutes of skiing is the Haus Heidi (604-932-3113), a small guesthouse prized for its warmth and personal service. Rooms for two with a bath are priced from $71 to $89, which includes a full breakfast.</p>
