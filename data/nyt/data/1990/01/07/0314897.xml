        <p>Classical</p>
        <p>ADAMS: ''THE WOUND DRESSER,'' ''FEARFUL SYMMETRIES'' - Orchestra of St. Luke's conducted by John Adams. A refined, understated work and a raucous, irreverent one fill out our image of this composer. (K. Robert Schwarz) Nonesuch 9 79218. HANDEL: ''MESSIAH'' - Taverner Choir; Taverner Players conducted by Andrew Parrott. This intimately scaled account on period instruments, modeled after Handel's last performances in Dublin, sacrifices nothing in majesty. (Barrymore L. Scherer) EMI/Angel 49801; two CD's only. ''LIVE IN TOKYO 1988'' - Placido Domingo, tenor; Kathleen Battle, soprano; Metropolitan Opera Orchestra conducted by James Levine. Everything went right in this tour concert, and Placido Domingo's work, sensitive and characterful, gives the most pleasure. (Will Crutchfield) Deutsche Grammophon 427 686; CD and cassette. MOZART: PIANO SONATAS (K. 309, 457), FANTASIES - Cyprien Katsaris, piano. With a fluid legato and individual ideas about ornamentation, the pianist once again proves himself one of the best and most interesting of his generation. (Harold C. Schonberg) Teldec CD 244 191; CD only. RACHMANINOFF: PIANO WORKS - Sergei Rachmaninoff, piano. This anthology collects almost all of the composer's solo piano music that he recorded after 1925, with unbelievable technique. (Schonberg) RCA/BMG 7766-2-RG; CD only. RILEY: ''SALOME DANCES FOR PEACE'' - Kronos Quartet. The founding Minimalist's work - simple and innocent yet intelligent and compelling - has a curious appeal. (John Rockwell) Nonesuch 79217; two CD's, LP's and cassettes. ROUSE: SYMPHONY NO. 1, ''PHANTASMATA'' - This coupling reveals two sides - the private, introspective and the poundingly rhythmic - of a composer who should be far better known. (Schwarz) Nonesuch 79230; CD and cassette. ''A TRIBUTE TO JASCHA HEIFETZ'' - Itzhak Perlman, violin; Samuel Sanders, piano. A masterful performance of scintillating Heifetz encore pieces ranging from Rameau to Gershwin. (Scherer) EMI/Angel 49604; CD and cassette.</p>
        <p>Pop/Jazz</p>
        <p>''ANYTHING GOES'' - Frederica von Stade, Kim Criswell, Cris Groenendaal, Jack Gilford; conducted by John McGlinn. This buoyant recording, using the restored original orchestrations, is another triumph for the young Mr. McGlinn. (Stephen Holden) EMI 7 49848. THE B-52'S: ''COSMIC THING'' - With this album, which can make the mundane seem almost heroic, the group has finally moved beyond cult status. (Karen Schoemer) Reprise 9 25854. MILES DAVIS: ''AURA'' - After a series of mechanical-pop duds, this album, recorded in 1984, provides wide-open spaces for trumpet ruminations; Mr. Davis once again sounds like his music matters. (Jon Pareles) Columbia 45332. QUINCY JONES: ''BACK ON THE BLOCK'' - This long-delayed album celebrates 40 years of African-descended music in a lavish musical collage; underneath its glitter and grandeur, it's a very personal record. (Holden) Quest/Warner Bros. 26020. THE MEKONS: ''THE MEKONS ROCK 'N' ROLL'' - One of the most intellectual bands in rock history - and one of the sloppiest - plunges into the music's center as it questions every moment. (Pareles) Twin/Tone/A &amp; M 5277. THE SCREAMING BLUE MESSIAHS: ''TOTALLY RELIGIOUS'' - Bill Carter's songs of speed and violence present a brutal world view, but one that makes for savage, vital rock-and-roll. (Pareles) Elektra 60859. ROD STEWART: ''STORYTELLER/THE COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY: 1964-90'' - This collection makes the shoddier material of this veteran rock star look better, even as it places his best work in a broader context. (Rockwell) Warner Bros. 25987; four CD's only. ERNEST TUBB: ''LIVE, 1965'' - Recorded in the Magic Castle Ballroom near Seattle, this album helps redeem the melancholy absence of live, homey recordings of the late Tubb and the Texas Troubadours. (Milo Miles) Rhino R2 70902.</p>
