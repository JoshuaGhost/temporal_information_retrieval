        <p>LEAD: The subway is not the street, not Hyde Park or Union Square Park where ideas and commerce flourish with room to spare. It is an underground space sometimes shadowed with narrow nooks and scary stairways and sometimes peopled by wild-eyed vagrants who just might be loony enough to push someone in front of a train.</p>
        <p>The subway is not the street, not Hyde Park or Union Square Park where ideas and commerce flourish with room to spare. It is an underground space sometimes shadowed with narrow nooks and scary stairways and sometimes peopled by wild-eyed vagrants who just might be loony enough to push someone in front of a train.</p>
        <p>Those who ride the New York subways regularly understand the difference. Not U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand. Finding a constitutional right to beg in the subways of New York, he has struck down the city's ban on begging by individuals. If the city wishes to allow charitable organizations to solicit in the subway, or to allow musicians who accept coins when they perform, it must allow beggars to beg in the subway.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand calls for narrower, more precise rules in place of a total ban. That imposes an impractical and unreasonable burden on the transit system, which is working to make the subways safe, in reality and appearance. It's a decision worth rapid review by higher courts.</p>
        <p>Forced to choose between banning all soliciting or none, New York would have to enact the broadest possible ban. But a city does not unduly suppress free speech, nor discriminate invidiously, when it chooses which activities its captive audience of transit patrons must endure. To say, as Judge Sand does, that other laws safeguard patrons against harassment is to ignore the realities of subway life. It's not practical to ask transit police to draw nice distinctions about who's being aggressive and who is only potentially so.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand also implies that the city's solicitude for subway users is an unworthy attempt to hide the face of poverty. That disregards the widely exercised and officially tolerated exercise of begging rights in the streets above. The city was neither callous nor careless in drafting rules aimed at broadening access to the subways in ways that would attract riders and make them feel safer.</p>
        <p>Begging is starkly expressive conduct that invokes First Amendment concerns. But like marching, picketing and other expressive conduct, begging has long been subject to regulation. Underground, a patron may surely feel more comfortable when approached by someone collecting for the homeless than when accosted by a sullen beggar. It's not irrational to fear bursts of profanity and threatening behavior.</p>
        <p>Beggars may well have special hardships, grievances and messages about social injustice. But they share with more fortunate humans an obligation to give breathing room. Underground, at least, their right to beg is overridden by everyone's right to use the subway system in peace. A city that looks out for the interests of all its inhabitants cannot be adjudged heartless.</p>
