        <p>LEAD: Marion Merrell Dow Inc., the recently merged pharmaceutical company based in Kansas City, Mo.. said yesterday that its net income fell 59.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989. Meanwhile the Warner-Lambert Company said its net income for the quarter rose 19.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell Dow Inc., the recently merged pharmaceutical company based in Kansas City, Mo.. said yesterday that its net income fell 59.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989. Meanwhile the Warner-Lambert Company said its net income for the quarter rose 19.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell Dow said earnings for the final quarter of 1989 totaled $22 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $54 million, or 35 cents a share, earned by Marion Laboratories Inc. alone in the 1988 quarter.</p>
        <p>Marion and the Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals unit of the Dow Chemical Company completed the merger last month.</p>
        <p>Special Charge</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell Dow said the quarterly results included a $44 million pretax special charge related to the merger transaction. Financial results reflected two months of performance by Marion alone and one month for the new company.</p>
        <p>The new company's sales rose 53.2 percent, to $337 million, from $220 million in the 1988 period.</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell Dow said special pretax charges of $297 million related to the merger resulted in a net loss of $79 million in the six months that ended Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the results were disappointing. ''They have been telegraphing that it wasn't going to be a great quarter,'' said David F. Saks at Wedbush Morgan Securities. ''But that's quite a lot of charge.''</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell's shares fell 62.5 cents today, to $26.50, in New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
        <p>Marion Merrell Dow said sales of both its heart drug Cardizem and Carafate, an anti-ulcer product, had increased. But Hemant K. Shah, an analyst with HKS &amp; Company in Warren, N.J., said both drugs had been losing market share.</p>
        <p>Warner Lambert</p>
        <p>Confirming forecasts it presented to securities analysts last week, the Warner-Lambert Company said yesterday that net income was $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of 1989, up 19.1 percent from $77.5 million in the 1988 quarter. Earnings per share were $1.37 in the quarter, compared with $1.14 in the 1988 period.</p>
        <p>Warner-Lambert, a diversified pharmaceutical company based in Morris Plains, N.J., said sales in the quarter were $1.04 billion, compared with $998 million in the 1988 period.</p>
        <p>Earnings for the year rose 21.3 percent to $413 million, on sales of $4.12 billion. Warner-Lambert had net income of $340 million on $3.91 billion in sales in 1988.</p>
        <p>Warner Lambert shares fell 50 cents, to $109, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
