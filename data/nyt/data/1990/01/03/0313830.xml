        <p>The Chiron Corporation and Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc., a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said they had an agreement to buy most of the AIDS and hepatitis blood-screening business of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company. The companies, which said last week that they were discussing the acquisition, did not disclose terms. The business will be combined with Ortho and Chiron's AIDS- and hepatitis-diagnosing business.</p>
        <p>Du Pont's business, which markets tests for hepatitis and for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to the blood-bank industry, had sales of more than $40 million last year. The purchase includes equipment, inventory, patents, trademarks and product rights. It is expected that key Du Pont employees in marketing, field sales, technical service and software development will join the Ortho organization.</p>
