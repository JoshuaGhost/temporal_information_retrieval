        <p>LEAD: Peter Jacobsen's bogey on the last hole cost him sole control of the second-round lead today in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.</p>
        <p>Peter Jacobsen's bogey on the last hole cost him sole control of the second-round lead today in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.</p>
        <p>''That wasn't very good, but otherwise it was a pretty good day,'' Jacobsen said after his six-under-par 66 lifted him into a three-way tie for the top at 133, 11 under par.</p>
        <p>With three rounds to go in the five-day, 90-hole, four-course tournament, Jacobsen shared the top spot with 48-year-old Dave Stockton and John Cook, who has not made a bogey in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Bogey Drops Jacobsen</p>
        <p>Jacobsen, who had scored seven birdies, was in the lead alone until his 6-iron approach drifted into a bunker and he made the bogey that dropped him back into a tie.</p>
        <p>Stockton, whose last victory came in the 1976 P.G.A. championship, shot 68 at Indian Wells.</p>
        <p>Cook, who has birdied seven of the eight par-5 holes he has played, also had a 68 at the Arnold Palmer course at PGA West.</p>
        <p>Reid a Stroke Back</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to get it around without crashing, and I didn't crash,'' said Cook, still recovering from an attack of influenza that very nearly caused him to withdraw from the tournament on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mike Reid was a stroke off the pace at 134. He shot 66 at Bermuda Dunes.</p>
        <p>The group at 135 was made up of Don Pooley, Bob Tway, Jim Booros, Tommy Armour 3d and Bob Wrenn.</p>
        <p>Watson and Palmer Tied</p>
        <p>Pooley had a share of the lead until he hit into the water on the final hole, made double bogey and took a 70.</p>
        <p>He played at the Arnold Palmer course at PGA West under the unique format that has the 128 pros playing one round on each of four desert resort courses, each day with a different three-man amateur team, before the field is cut for the pros-only finish at the Palmer course on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Palmer, 60, making his 31st consecutive appearance in the tournament he has won five times, had a 70 that left him at 143. He was tied at that figure, 10 off the pace, with Tom Watson, who struggled to a 73 in the chilly wind and brief showers.</p>
