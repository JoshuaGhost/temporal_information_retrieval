        <p>LEAD: ''Murder in Paradise,'' tonight's ''NBC Movie of the Week,'' is about the burned-out New York City cop of the week.

        <p>LEAD: ''Murder in Paradise,'' tonight's ''NBC Movie of the Week,'' is about the burned-out New York City cop of the week. Charlie Raski can be encountered at 9 P.M. beach-bumming and bar-boozing in Hawaii.

        <p>''Murder in Paradise,'' tonight's ''NBC Movie of the Week,'' is about the burned-out New York City cop of the week. Charlie Raski can be encountered at 9 P.M. beach-bumming and bar-boozing in Hawaii. His problem is that he still wakes up sweating to nightmares about a murderer who killed his wife and eight other people back home with a nylon stocking and painted their faces, too. So how do you think Raski feels when a face-painting stocking strangler sets to work in Hawaii? He feels he's being picked on.</p>
        <p>Along the way to exorcising his bad memories, Raski (Kevin Kilner) meets a wholesome police psychologist (Maggie Han) and the exotically unwholesome Emma Danton (Barbara Carrera) who paints, practices the martial arts and sometimes wears neither nylons nor panty hose. We get to see considerable sand and surf as well as a lot of Mr. Kilner's chest. The people here talk like this: ''It's all too heavy, Charlie.'' ''I want in.'' ''He's losing it.''</p>
        <p>Except for the psychologist. She talks like this: ''The Revin case was too traumatic for Mr. Raski. He could be at risk.'' The best line comes from the bartender, the most sensible person on the island. He says: ''I don't want to listen to this again.''</p>
        <p>Sand and Surf</p>
        <p>MURDER IN PARADISE, directed by Fred Walton; teleplay by Gerald DiPego, based on a story Mr. DiPego and Bill McCutchen; set decorator, Jim Duffy; costume supervisor, Linda Redmon; music editor, Lauri Higgins Tobias; produced by Mr. McCutchen for Bill McCutchen Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television.
