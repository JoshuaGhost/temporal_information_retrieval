        <p>LEAD: Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez mounted a frontal assault yesterday on New York City's decentralized school system, demanding that its 32 local boards clear all candidates for district superintendent with him.</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez mounted a frontal assault yesterday on New York City's decentralized school system, demanding that its 32 local boards clear all candidates for district superintendent with him.</p>
        <p>''I'm saying you pick the superintendent, but these are the conditions under which you pick them,'' the blunt-spoken new Chancellor told reporters on a visit to City Hall for a City Council committee hearing. ''If they are not qualified, don't pick them because they are going to be challenged.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez spoke after he invalidated the choice of a superintendent made by Community School Board 19 in the East New York section of Brooklyn and asked its members to start the selection process all over again.</p>
        <p>He said he would require every school board to submit to him evaluations of their top three candidates and would challenge those candidates he considered unqualified. If a school board defied him and picked a candidate he opposed, Mr. Fernandez said in an interview, he would supersede the board and remove the superintendent.</p>
        <p>Decentralization was adopted 20 years ago in an effort to make the schools more responsive to their communities. Since then, chancellors have superseded, or overruled, local boards many times on a variety of matters but not on hiring a superintendent. Mr. Fernandez's announcement yesterday, less than three weeks after taking office, demonstrated a much broader interpretation of the chancellor's authority than that of his predecessors.</p>
        <p>Lawyers and advocates for the community school boards said the move posed a serious threat to decentralization, which gave the elected boards, not the chancellor, prime control over elementary and junior high schools and the right to pick superintendents.</p>
        <p>''It's a further deterioration of decentralization,'' said George Shebitz, a lawyer who has represented at least 13 of the 32 boards. Phillip Kaplan, the executive director of the New York City Community School Boards Association, who is also a lawyer, questioned the legality of the Chancellor's move.</p>
        <p>Barrage of Disclosures</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez's action comes after a barrage of disclosures in the last year and a half about corrupt, politically tainted or incompetent school boards and a growing feeling that decentralization has failed the schoolchildren. The most stark example came last fall, when Colman Genn, superintendent of District 27 in Queens, produced taped conversations in which school board members demanded jobs for relatives, friends and political allies before they would support his rehiring.</p>
        <p>One reason that Mr. Fernandez is acting now is that the contracts of more than half of the superintendents expire this spring. He is also seeking legislation to allow him to rate superintendent candidates as favorable or unfavorable and require school boards to choose from his favored choices.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Fernandez, James S. Vlasto, said the Chancellor has the authority under the decentralization law to supersede a local board over the appointment of a superintendent. ''This has been checked not only with the Board of Education's lawyers but the Corporation Counsel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He cited a section of the decentralization law that allows a chancellor to supersede a board for failing ''to comply with any applicable provisions of law, bylaws, rules or regulations, directives and agreements.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez did not take such drastic action yesterday in the case of Board 19 when he blocked the board's selection of a new superintendent.</p>
        <p>Written Evaluations</p>
        <p>He ordered the board to start over on the selection process and to submit to him the names of three finalists for the post, along with written evaluations of their performance in prior jobs.</p>
        <p>He said he would ''review and comment on these evaluations in order to assist the school board in the selection process.'' Then, he added, he will soon be issuing a citywide circular requiring all the boards to follow a similar procedure in selecting superintendents.</p>
        <p>The nine-member District 19 board voted last month to replace the current superintendent, Levander Lilly, on July 1 with Felix Vasquez, the principal of Junior High School 162 in Bushwick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez publicly criticized the Board 19 selection Tuesday night, saying Mr. Vasquez had a ''spotty educational record and a host of other allegations pending.'' Mr. Vasquez's sister, Elba Roman, is a Democratic district leader in the area and former District 32 school board member. She has been indicted on charges of falsifying a financial statement she submitted as a board member. Mr. Vasquez ran for Democratic district leader in Park Slope but withdrew after his petitions were challenged as fraudulent.</p>
        <p>History of Political Feuding</p>
        <p>District 19 boards have a history of political feuding, district officials and board members have said. They say that some members are either related to or have campaigned for Councilwoman Priscilla Wooten and that others have been connected to Congressman Edolphus Towns. There have also been allegations that board members have made Mr. Lilly's tenure conditional on his willingness to hire their friends and allies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez, siding with dissidents on the board and with a group of parents who had submitted two grievances to him, found several technical violations in the process that led to Mr. Vasquez's selection. The board, for example, had not formally passed a resolution authorizing money to advertise the vacancy, even though the board did advertise the position.</p>
        <p>In District 19, it is possible that members may go through the process again and that a majority will still select Mr. Vasquez. Mr. Fernandez could choose to reject him and force a confrontation that could end up in the courts.</p>
        <p>Corrina Grant, president of the District 19 board, said she would abide by Mr. Fernandez's decision to repeat the process, but added, ''I just have a problem with where is the role of the local school board and where in the law does it state that a chancellor must review a local candidate.''</p>
        <p>Minority Targets</p>
        <p>She also questioned how Mr. Fernandez has chosen the first targets of his disciplinary measures. ''Why is it that all of this is happening to minority communities, to minority principals and minority districts?'' she said.</p>
        <p>In his first two weeks in office, Mr. Fernandez, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, suspended a high school principal in Brooklyn and a junior high school principal in the Bronx and ordered the removal of a Bronx superintendent, who would be only the second superintendent dismissed since decentralization began. Two of the administrators are black and one is Hispanic.</p>
        <p>Responding to her remarks, Mr. Vlasto, Mr. Fernandez's spokesman, said: ''It happens to be a coincidence. The Chancellor doesn't base his actions on such criteria. He bases his actions on the evidence that is presented.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Fernandez said that in his circular he would set standards for the position of superintendent. Those, he said, would include measures of a person's performance as a principal or other administrator, including student improvement in reading and writing.</p>
        <p>''What this does is assure some quality control in the selection of superintendents,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dennis Coleman, president of the School Boards Association, predicted that the Chancellor's directives would have little immediate impact since most school boards have already signed their contracts with the superintendents who will be starting service in July. But over all, he said, ''it appears to be an effort to kill decentralization.''</p>
