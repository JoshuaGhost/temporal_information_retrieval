        <p>A ferry carrying about 150 people sank tonight in a river outside Dhaka, and about 50 passengers reportedly swam to shore, the police said.</p>
        <p>Darkness hampered rescue efforts. By midnight no bodies had been recovered, the police said.</p>
        <p>The ferry sank in the Dhaleswari River near Mushiganj town, 20 miles southeast of this capital.</p>
        <p>A police official, reached by telephone, said about 150 people were aboard the ferry.</p>
        <p>''We have reports of 50 people swimming ashore,'' he said. ''We don't yet know what had happened to the others.''</p>
        <p>The police said overloading might have caused the sinking.</p>
        <p>They said a more precise count on fatalities was unlikely to emerge before Monday morning, when divers would be sent to the scene. The ferry was on a run from Munshiganj to Dhaka.</p>
