        <p>LEAD: The nation's largest banks yesterday reduced the prime rate to 10 percent, from 10 1/2 percent, the first cut in the closely watched lending rate since July.</p>
        <p>The nation's largest banks yesterday reduced the prime rate to 10 percent, from 10 1/2 percent, the first cut in the closely watched lending rate since July.</p>
        <p>The First National Bank of Chicago led the way, and was quickly followed by Citibank, the nation's largest, and other major banks around the country. The cut in the prime, which analysts had expected for nearly two months, comes amid widespread signs of a weakening economy. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to continue reducing short-term rates in an effort to prevent the economy from slipping into a recession.</p>
        <p>'Process of Improvement'</p>
        <p>''By itself, the change in the prime rate is not going to change loan demand or do much for the economy, but it is part of the process of improvement,'' said James E. Annable, senior vice president at First National. ''What the economy needs is more spending, and to get that we expect that the Federal Reserve will be reducing interest rates, perhaps not right away, but not too far in the future.''</p>
        <p>The prime rate is a benchmark used by banks to set interest rates on a wide range of borrowing by individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. About half of the $100 billion of home equity loans outstanding have interest rates pegged to the prime. And interest rates on many automobile loans and credit-card borrowings are also adjusted according to changes in the prime.</p>
        <p>The cut in the rate will affect these loans over the next few months, easing somewhat the debt burden of millions of Americans and freeing funds that might be spent to keep the economy growing.</p>
        <p>Lower Rates Expected</p>
        <p>The lowering of the prime rate caused the dollar to fall sharply against the West German mark and other European currencies. Traders said the drop in the prime was a reminder that American interest rates are expected to head lower, which will make the dollar less attractive relative to other currencies.[Page D16.]  Although for weeks analysts have been predicting a cut in the prime rate, large banks did not move quickly because of erratic moves in short-term rates in recent months. After falling rapidly about the time of the last cut in the prime, in late July, when the rate was reduced from 11% to 10 1/2 percent, some rates increased during the autumn and only recently fell back to the levels of late July and early August.</p>
        <p>Several bankers who asked not to be identified added that the prime rate was slow to fall because of their desire to help the banks' earnings at a time when costs are rising in other parts of their business. Some costs, like growing losses on loans for construction and real estate development, have emerged in the last year. But others, like the rising portion of bank deposits held in interest-bearing accounts rather than interest-free checking accounts, have been under way for several years.</p>
        <p>How much lower the prime rate falls in coming months depends on declines in other short-term interest rates that are controlled by the Federal Reserve Board. Since May, the Federal Reserve has gradually eased monetary policy to reduce short-term rates by about one and a half percentage points.</p>
        <p>''The Fed will be willing to ease some, to guard against the risk of a more severe downturn in the economy,'' said Donald Fine, chief market strategist at Chase Manhattan Bank. He estimated that the Fed might push down the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to 8 percent by the end of the month and perhaps to 7 3/4 percent afterward, from around 8 1/4 percent now. But larger, more rapid moves to reduce interest rates are not likely, he said, unless new evidence emerges that the downturn in the automobile industry is spreading to other sectors of the economy.</p>
        <p>Without increases in unemployment, many economists said they do not expect consumer and business spending to fall enough to produce a full-blown recession. They said the most recent employment report, for December, which showed a gain of only 142,000 workers on payrolls, less than expected, coupled with a further decline in manufacturing jobs was a sign of weakness but not recession. The unemployment rate was stable at 5.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The December numbers were weak enough to cause some economists to predict that the gross national product in the fourth quarter will show no growth. When the G.N.P. data are announced on Jan. 26, some analysts expect that pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy and reduce short-term interest rates will be even greater.</p>
        <p>'In a Mild Recession'</p>
        <p>Other analysts foresee spreading signs of economic weakness, with greater declines in short-term interest rates.</p>
        <p>Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Inc., a banking company based in Providence, R.I., said, ''The economy is in a mild recession, with flat to lower growth in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.'' He said the January employment statistics, which will be published in early February, ''will be disastrous,'' with declines in the payrolls of auto makers of 120,000 workers, plus payroll cuts at companies that supply car makers.</p>
        <p>The Fed will respond to the weaker employment statistics by reducing short-term interest rates a percentage point or more, Mr. Ciminero said, bringing the prime rate down to 9 percent by late spring or early summer.</p>
