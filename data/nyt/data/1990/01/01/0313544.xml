        <p>LEAD: With the impasse over the fate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega entering its second week, the new President of Panama and his Attorney General disagreed today over whether to file charges against the deposed strongman or leave the question of his prosecution to the United States.</p>
        <p>With the impasse over the fate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega entering its second week, the new President of Panama and his Attorney General disagreed today over whether to file charges against the deposed strongman or leave the question of his prosecution to the United States.</p>
        <p>The split, reflected in contradictory statements by President Guillermo Endara and his newly named Attorney General, Rogelio Cruz, came on another day of seemingly fruitless talks between American officials and representatives of the Vatican.</p>
        <p>General Noriega has been holed up at the Vatican mission here since Christmas Eve. In Houston, where President Bush is spending the New Year's holiday, the President declined to comment on the Panamanian disagreement.</p>
        <p>Impractical, President Says</p>
        <p>Attorney General Cruz announced that his office might try to indict the general on charges of murder and drug trafficking, a step that could involve asking the American authorities to keep the general in what he called preventive detention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz suggested that he might seek to file charges as early as Tuesday and that the charges could relate to the killing of at least 10 military officers who sought to topple General Noriega on Oct. 3, including the uprising's leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega.</p>
        <p>But soon after Mr. Cruz spoke, President Endara dismissed the idea of Panama prosecuting the ousted dictator as impractical.</p>
        <p>The problem, Mr. Endara said, is that while Panamanians want General Noriega punished, the country has not had enough time to rebuild its criminal-justice system after the United States military strike on Dec. 20. The American assault swept away the staffs of virtually all of the Noriega-dominated institutions of government.</p>
        <p>''I hope,'' Mr. Endara said, ''that the Pope does not put us on the spot'' by agreeing to an arrangement under which the general would be handed over to Panama for prosecution.</p>
        <p>'Only Fair and Right'</p>
        <p>There were unconfirmed reports this morning that negotiators had hammered out a solution that would involve a third country taking custody of the general.</p>
        <p>Asked about the disagreement in Panama, Mr. Bush, who had just visited Americans wounded in the invasion, said: ''It doesn't help you all for me just to speculate on this, but we want him brought to justice. It's only fair and right for these kids lying here that that happens, and I'm determined to see that that happens. So we'll keep working the problem. But I can't help you, because it's just a lot of diplomatic effort going on.''</p>
        <p>Vatican officials have been saying for days that an arrangement under which General Noriega is sent to a third country would be the most practical solution to the impasse.</p>
        <p>Panamanian officials said they were unaware of any breakthrough. But word began circulating today that American military officials had begun preparations to designate a pool of reporters to cover a major development at the papal mission.</p>
        <p>The United States Embassy in Panama has refused to discuss the progress of its talks with Vatican representatives. Last week, Bush Administration representatives said that while they were still hopeful of gaining custody of General Noriega, they thought his future was increasingly likely to be determined by the Panamanian Government.</p>
        <p>Division Within the Church</p>
        <p>President Bush, calling General Noriega a ''narco-terrorist'' and a common criminal, has been insisting that he be turned over to the American troops ringing the mission, while Vatican officials continue to argue that there are political considerations that prevent them from doing that.</p>
        <p>The differing official views over what to do with the general came a day after a division became apparent within the Roman Catholic Church. Panama's bishops urged the Pope on Saturday to hand over General Noriega for trial in whatever country the Government judged appropriate.</p>
        <p>The various perspectives seem to reflect the deepening legal and political complexities of the situation that the ousted dictator created when he appeared, clad in rumpled fatigues, at the door of the papal mission last Sunday and asked for political asylum.</p>
        <p>Although some Panamanian officials brushed off the disagreements this weekend as of little consequence, others said they feared the developments were a sign that the diplomatic standoff, which the Pope's chief spokesman said last week could well end in ''a few days,'' might go on for weeks.</p>
        <p>'Off the Top of His Head'</p>
        <p>Mr. Endara, discussing the Attorney General's statement about General Noriega, said: ''We told the Pope that we have no possibility of giving him due process. We have no Supreme Court, no judicial process.''</p>
        <p>Later, a senior aide to President Endara dismissed the Attorney General's suggestions today as something ''off the top of his head'' that had not been discussed in advance with Mr. Endara.</p>
        <p>The two officials are former law partners, although Mr. Cruz is a political independent and Mr. Endara a member of the Authentic Liberal Party, the party that won the election that General Noriega annulled this year.</p>
        <p>Some members of the Endara Cabinet have expressed distrust of Mr. Cruz because of his past associations with Ricardo de la Espriella, a former President who was installed and later removed by General Noriega.</p>
        <p>Few officials here were willing to wager against the possibility that Mr. Endara's thinking on the subject would again shift on short notice. Reversal Pleases U.S. In the course of less than seven days, the new President has gone from flatly opposing the extradition of General Noriega to favoring his arrest by the United States. His reversal last week, which pleased American officials, came in a letter to Pope John Paul II dated Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Endara told the Pope that the best solution would be for the Papal Nuncio to deny General Noriega further sanctuary so that ''on leaving the nunciature, he would be in the hands of the troops of the United States of America, who would guarantee his security and, presumably, bring him to justice.''</p>
        <p>On the same day the Pope's chief spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said, ''taking into account international law and accepted procedure, I don't see how the nunciature can hand over someone'' to a government other than that of the host country.</p>
        <p>Although President Endara said he would expect General Noriega to be tried ''for the common and despicable crimes for which he is accused in our country,'' Panamanian officials have made it clear that there are no formal charges pending. #3,000 Detainees Freed So far the only official charges against General Noriega are money-laundering and drug-trafficking accusations included in Federal indictments issued in February 1988 by two Federal grand juries in Florida.</p>
        <p>A senior United States Embassy official said last week that among the more than 4,000 people arrested by United States forces in Panama since the Dec. 20 invasion, a large number had been arrested at the specific request of the new Government, although in the absence of indictments.</p>
        <p>The official said that by late last week more than 3,000 of the detainees had been released after pledging their loyalty to the new Government. Officials said 1,347 prisoners are being held a a detention camp near Rodman Naval Station, at the Pacific terminus of the Panama Canal.</p>
        <p>A handful of prisoners, including several former top Noriega aides, were flown to Miami last week to face charges growing out of the indictments handed up there.</p>
        <p>About 40 other Noriega loyalists, men the American Embassy official described as ''the real bad guys,'' were being held at an American military base here for interrogation, processing and probably future trials.</p>
