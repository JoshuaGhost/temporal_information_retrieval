        <p>LEAD: PROLONGED cold weather taxes home heating equipment, thus increasing the likelihood of an unexpected shutdown.</p>
        <p>PROLONGED cold weather taxes home heating equipment, thus increasing the likelihood of an unexpected shutdown.</p>
        <p>If your furnace stops working, the procedures described herein may help you to restart it quickly and safely. But if you cannot restart your furnace by these methods, or if you suspect a dangerous situation, call a heating company technician for service.</p>
        <p>The first step in restarting a furnace is to inspect its thermostat, which is usually in a main living area. If the dial or other control is set to a lower temperature than that showing on the thermostat's thermometer, advance the control 5 to 10 degrees higher than the thermometer reading. If the thermostat has a timer, check that its settings are correct.</p>
        <p>Making these adjustments should restart the furnace. If they do not, and if the furnace is an oil burner, next inspect the emergency switch that governs power to the furnace. This is usually on a wall at the top of a stairway leading to a basement furnace or just inside the doorway of a room where the furnace is.</p>
        <p>Most emergency switches have red cover plates that are clearly labeled, but in other respects they resemble ordinary wall switches and can be switched off inadvertently. Returning the switch to its ''on'' position should enable the furnace to run normally.</p>
        <p>If the furnace still will not start, go to the service panel or fuse box and check whether the circuit breakers or fuses controlling the furnace have tripped or blown.</p>
        <p>Tripped circuit breakers are easy to spot and reset, but identifying the condition of cartridge fuses used for furnaces is not. If you have reason to suspect the fuses - for example, if they are more than 5 years old - replace them and see if the furnace restarts. Otherwise, carry out the remaining procedures; if they fail, replace the fuses as a last resort before calling for service.</p>
        <p>Except in the case of fuses that fail because of age, a tripped circuit breaker or blown fuse governing a furnace indicates a problem that should be checked by an electrician or heating service technician.</p>
        <p>Make sure there is oil in the fuel storage tank, otherwise the furnace will not function. To get an accurate reading from the gauge, tap it with your finger to loosen any stuck parts.</p>
        <p>Go to the furnace and find the burner switch, which is connected to a metal-sheathed electric cable on or near the furnace. The burner switch resembles the emergency switch - both control the same circuit - and make sure that the switch is turned on.</p>
        <p>Also find the primary control unit, alternatively called the ignition safety relay. This is a metal box mounted either on the furnace pipe leading to the chimney or on the furnace above the burner. After waiting 30 minutes if the furnace is hot, set the thermostat in the living area to activate the furnace and then press the button on the primary control.</p>
        <p>The furnace should start. If it does not, press the button a second time. If this attempt fails, move the burner switch to the ''off'' position and call for service.</p>
        <p>Some gas furnaces feature electrical spark ignition, which must be serviced by a professional. More common are gas furnaces ignited by a continuously burning pilot flame. To restart these, first check whether the pilot flame has gone out. To view the flame, you must usually remove an access panel on the furnace.</p>
        <p>If the flame is out, follow the instructions for relighting it that are printed on the furnace or pilot assembly. Generally, the procedure involves first turning off the gas supply. On many furnaces, this is done by turning to the ''off'' position a control knob on the pilot assembly.</p>
        <p>On older furnaces without a control knob, this is done by closing both the main inlet valve and the pilot inlet valve (the smaller of the two), which are on the gas inlet pipe near the furnace. Turning the valve handles so that they are perpendicular to the pipes on which they are installed shuts off the gas.</p>
        <p>Wait at least five minutes for accumulated gas to dissipate. During this time, turn the thermostat governing the furnace to its lowest setting; next, turn on the gas supply to the pilot burner, either by moving the control knob to the ''pilot'' setting or by reopening the pilot inlet valve on the gas inlet pipe.</p>
        <p>Now light a match and hold it in front of the pilot burner. At the same time, press down on the control knob or on a reset button beside it. If the furnace has no control knob, press down on the single button or lever that you will find on a small metal box inside the furnace, usually near the opening covered by the access panel.</p>
        <p>In all cases, hold the button or lever down until the pilot flame lights and then continue holding it for a full minute, or as the instructions on the furnace specify. If the pilot flame goes out during this time or when you release the button or lever, repeat the procedure up to two more times, holding the button or lever down about 30 seconds longer each time.</p>
        <p>If the pilot flame does not stay lighted after these attempts, shut off the gas supply and call for service.</p>
        <p>If the pilot flame remains lit, turn the control knob to ''on'' or reopen the main gas inlet valve. You then should be able to restart the furnace by advancing the thermostat. If the furnace does not light immediatly, shut off the gas supply and call for service.</p>
        <p>Should you smell gas at any time, open all doors and windows and immediately evacuate all occupants from the house. Shut off the main gas supply valve, which is beside the gas meter, by turning the handle so that it is perpendicular to the pipe on which it is installed. Then call the utility company from a nearby telephone.</p>
