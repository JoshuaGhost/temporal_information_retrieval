        <p>Mongolia's Communist legislators formally abolished their party's monopoly on power today and approved elections with more than one candidate. But the election law was drafted before recent democracy protests and does not mention a role for opposition parties, officials said.</p>
        <p>Parliament voted 324 to 10 in favor of amending two sections of the Constitution that say the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party is the leading force in society and the state.</p>
        <p>The changes follow actions by the Soviet Union and Eastern European Communist countries, where the Communists recently gave up monopolies on power. Mongolia follows the Soviet line on most questions. Its Constitution now says that Mongolians have the right to join parties whose platforms ''correspond to the genuine interests of the people, in order to build up humane and democratic socialism.''</p>
        <p>The reference to socialism was added after a heated debate in which many delegates insisted that special mention should still be given to socialism and the ruling party.</p>
        <p>Democracy opposition groups said they would hold a demonstration Sunday at the Government palace to demand that Parliament resign.</p>
