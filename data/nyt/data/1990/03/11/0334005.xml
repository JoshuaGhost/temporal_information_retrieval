        <p>LEAD: ''What did he know, and when did he know it?'' This now-famous question should be asked of Jim Valvano. A major college basketball coach sets the tone for his players on the court with the tactics he teaches them. He sets the tone for them off the court by his own behavior. If Jim Valvano was not aware of his players' unlawful activities, he is guilty of incompetence.</p>

        <p>''What did he know, and when did he know it?'' This now-famous question should be asked of Jim Valvano. A major college basketball coach sets the tone for his players on the court with the tactics he teaches them. He sets the tone for them off the court by his own behavior. If Jim Valvano was not aware of his players' unlawful activities, he is guilty of incompetence. If he was aware - and did nothing to bring it to light - he is guilty of complicity. Either way, he is personally accountable for his school's problems.</p>
