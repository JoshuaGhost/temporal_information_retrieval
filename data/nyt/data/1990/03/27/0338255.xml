        <p>LEAD: Paul Koerner, an investment adviser convicted of fraud in a platinum scheme that bilked investors of millions of dollars, was sentenced last week to eight years in prison.</p>
        <p>Paul Koerner, an investment adviser convicted of fraud in a platinum scheme that bilked investors of millions of dollars, was sentenced last week to eight years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koerner, who is 40 years old, was convicted in December of six counts of fraud and acquitted of six counts of selling platinum-backed securities without a proper license. Mr. Koerner had maintained he was not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koerner was a weekly commentator on financial developments for a national cable television program and was often quoted as an expert on metals investments in financial publications. He also published a newsletter. The authorities said Mr. Koerner was a confidence man, convincing investors he could buy platinum bars directly from South African mines and sell them at substantially higher prices to companies like General Motors. The prosecution said Mr. Koerner had never bought the platinum and instead paid off early investors with the money from later investors.</p>
