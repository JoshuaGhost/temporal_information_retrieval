        <p>LEAD: Representative Jim Courter, who lost a lopsided race for governor to Jim Florio last November, will not run for re-election to Congress this year.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Representative Jim Courter, who lost a lopsided race for governor to Jim Florio last November, will not run for re-election to Congress this year.</p>
        <p>Representative Jim Courter, who lost a lopsided race for governor to Jim Florio last November, will not run for re-election to Congress this year.</p>
        <p>At a hastily scheduled news conference here, Mr. Courter, a conservative Republican from Hackettstown, said that after almost 12 years in Congress representing the 12th District in the northwest corner of the state, he had accomplished much of what he had set out to do and now wanted to spend more time with his family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Courter's wife, Carmen, and his teen-age daughters, Donica and Katrina, were with him at the Headquarters Plaza Hotel for the announcement. Several times Mr. Courter appeared to choke back tears.</p>
        <p>''I leave Congress with a sense of accomplishment and a degree of sadness,'' he said. ''But I have the satisfaction of knowing this is the right decision because I can spend more time with my family.''</p>
        <p>After completing a statement in which he highlighted his career in Washington and only briefly mentioned his defeat last year, Mr. Courter hugged his family and asked reporters for the privilege of not answering questions about his decision. He said he would discuss his reasons in greater detail next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Courter's political career spanned 12 years and included just one electoral loss, the one to Mr. Florio.</p>
        <p>During his time in Congress, Mr. Courter, 48 years old, was considered a rising star by conservative Republicans. He is the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services subcommittee on procurement and military nuclear systems and a staunch supporter of former President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Courter lost to Mr. Florio by 24 percentage points. He was expected to have trouble being re-elected, but no strong challenger has come forward.</p>
        <p>Among those who might run for the Republican nomination are Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen of Morristown and Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, the former president of the State Board of Public Utilities.</p>
        <p>A Democrat, Marguerite Chandler, is scheduled to announce her candidacy next Tuesday. Mrs. Chandler, a 46-year-old real-estate executive from Somerville, has never run for public office.</p>
