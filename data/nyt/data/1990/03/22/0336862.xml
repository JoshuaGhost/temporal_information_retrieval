        <p>LEAD: Fifteen months ago, in an effort to keep the giant Fresh Kills Landfill from filling up too fast, New York City doubled the fee it charges private garbage haulers for the right to dump trash there.</p>
        <p>Fifteen months ago, in an effort to keep the giant Fresh Kills Landfill from filling up too fast, New York City doubled the fee it charges private garbage haulers for the right to dump trash there.</p>
        <p>The tactic has worked well - almost too well.</p>
        <p>Dumping at Fresh Kills - a rising pyramid of trash that is the world's largest landfill - has dropped by about 30 percent.</p>
        <p>But now, Ohio, Kentucky and several other states - distant, cheaper destinations for some of the New York garbage - are threatening to impose import restrictions. People there resent being someone else's dumping ground, especially New York's, and besides, they have their own garbage crises. $100 Million a Year Closer to home, in the Greenpoint and Williamsburg sections of Brooklyn, residents are up in arms over what the state says has been a surge in transfer stations, where garbage is repackaged for transport to landfills upstate or to other states. Neighbors say they are smelly and noisy, and officials say some do not meet environmental guidelines.</p>
        <p>As for the financial benefits of the higher fees, the private haulers have stayed away in such numbers that New York City's Sanitation Department says it is losing $100 million a year.</p>
        <p>New York finds itself in a puzzle that illustrates just how limited its current waste-disposal options are. The situation offers perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the region's mounting garbage disposal problem since the ''Mobro'' garbage barge fiasco of about three years ago. At the time, a barge laden with Long Island trash was denied access to a dump by six states and three countries in the course of a 162-day, 6,000-mile journey.</p>
        <p>Almost nobody wanted that garbage, and refuse has become even less popular today, say many people in government and the solid waste industry.</p>
        <p>The problem is that New York and many other states are running out of places to dump their garbage. For the most part, New York City relies for disposal on the Fresh Kills Landfill. A state estimate several years ago predicted that capacity at the site would be exhausted by the year 2000. And a plan to build several incincerators has been stalled amid environmental concerns. In an attempt to extend the life of the landfill, the Sanitation Department in December 1988 raised the dumping fee for haulers of commercial waste. The increase, to $40 a cubic yard, or about $80 a ton, from $18 a cubic yard, sent the haulers scurrying for other disposal venues.</p>
        <p>As a result, the landfill is now receiving between 18,000 and 20,000 tons a day, 8,000 tons a day less than before the rate increase. Brendan Sexton, the Sanitation Commissioner, said yesterday that the city had expected only about 10 percent to 20 percent of the privately hauled waste to be diverted.</p>
        <p>Instead, ''we raised the rate and wham, the waste disappeared,'' he said. The increase has cost the city $100 million in annual revenue, he said, but more than that will be saved by adding years to the landfill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sexton also said no one in government predicted the rapid increase in interstate shipments of waste as a result of the increase in the dumping fee.</p>
        <p>''If we could have predicted that, it might have changed how we handled'' the increase, he said, suggesting a phase-in period might have been employed.</p>
        <p>The increase in truck traffic is readily apparent in some city neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''You can sit here on Canal Street and watch truck after truck going to the Holland Tunnel to go on to Kentucky and Ohio,'' said Michael Burke, a Sanitation Department official.</p>
        <p>'Very Angry at New Yorkers'</p>
        <p>The city will likely have to reckon with the increased waste exports soon.</p>
        <p>At least Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky are considering legal changes to make it more difficult to import out-of-state waste.</p>
        <p>''To be very frank, we are very angry at New Yorkers over making us your dumping ground. It is a situation we find intolerable,'' Richard Sahli, deputy director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, recently told a New York legislative hearing.</p>
        <p>''We have a very serious problem and not enough people taking it seriously,'' said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican and vice chairman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management.</p>
        <p>More than 11 percent, or 2.3 million tons, of New York State's waste is being exported annually, he said. That is more than double the total at the end of 1988.</p>
        <p>''Everyone remembers the garbage barge,'' said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican and vice chairman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management. ''The trucks are going to be the garbage barges of the highway.''</p>
        <p>New York City has more than an interstate problem. The increased dumping fee had a direct impact on Greenpoint and Williamsburgh in Brooklyn. These are neighborhoods with industry, where residents are generally accustomed to dirty, noisy businesses.</p>
        <p>'Wreaked Havoc'</p>
        <p>But some residents said they did not bargain for a big rise in the number of sites that serve as an intermediate stop for commercially generated garbage on its way out of state.</p>
        <p>''The transfer stations have wreaked havoc,'' said Inez Pasher, a member of the local community board. The situation has improved since residents started to complain early last year about the smell of the operations and truck noise, Ms. Pasher said.</p>
        <p>The State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, Thomas C. Jorling, estimates that about 40 of the city's 200 or more transfer stations are in the Greenpoint-Williamsburg area.</p>
        <p>Transfer stations that are properly run serve a useful purpose, Mr. Sexton said, by at least increasing the amount of garbage that is recycled. At the stations, trucks that have collected waste are emptied and often scoured for material that can be salvaged for sale. What remains is bundled and placed on trucks for shipment to a landfill, many times out of state.</p>
        <p>Some stations have been shut down for not having proper permits, operations that Mr. Sexton described as ''fly by night.'' He also acknowledged that the industry ''grew faster than we or the state could regulate them.'' Residents of the area have complained bitterly about overlapping jurisdictions that have hurt enforcement efforts.</p>
        <p>A lawyer representing several transfer stations, Lawrence B. Goldberg, acknowledged that there have been some abuses. But he said transfer stations were not responsible for the increased truck traffic, blame for which he placed squarely on the city because of the increased dumping fees.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Goldberg said city and state government were giving in to political pressure by unfairly cracking down on transfer stations.</p>
