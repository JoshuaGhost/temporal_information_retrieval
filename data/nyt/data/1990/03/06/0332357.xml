        <p>LEAD: A study of twins who served in the military in the Vietnam era offers new evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder is more a product of combat than of any inborn susceptibility to stress.</p>
        <p>A study of twins who served in the military in the Vietnam era offers new evidence that post-traumatic stress disorder is more a product of combat than of any inborn susceptibility to stress.</p>
        <p>The findings indicate that the disorder - marked by painful memories, flashbacks and nightmares - is three times as common among veterans who served in Southeast Asia as among their identical twins who served elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The 179 twins who saw heavy combat in Vietnam were found to suffer nine times as often from the problem as their identical twins. ''Identical twins are more similar than any two individuals,'' said the chief researcher, Jack Goldberg, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''And so you have two guys with 100 percent of the same genes, who grew up together, and one guy goes to war and one doesn't. And 15 years later, one has post-traumatic stress disorder and one doesn't. That sort of debunks the idea of predisposition.''</p>
        <p>The study, published in the current Journal of the American Medical Association, was developed from a specially designed registry of 2,092 male twins in military service from 1965 to 1975.</p>
        <p>Genes and Environment</p>
        <p>He said the registry was established to further scientists' understanding of health problems believed to be partly due to genetic traits and partly to environment, including alcoholism, drug abuse and heart disease.</p>
        <p>When the survey was conducted in 1987, 16.8 percent of the twins who served in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam era had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Just 5 percent of their identical twin brothers who did not serve in Southeast Asia had the symptoms.</p>
        <p>Terence M. Keane, chief of psychology at the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center, said the study ''represents a major advance in our understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder.''</p>
        <p>The findings closely match those of a Congressional study that estimated that 15 percent of Vietnam veterans suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, Dr. Goldberg said. That means 450,000 veterans are afflicted with it, he said. ''They're not psychotic,'' he said. ''They're not crazy. They have nightmares. They have problems. But our sense is that a lot of these guys function very well.''</p>
