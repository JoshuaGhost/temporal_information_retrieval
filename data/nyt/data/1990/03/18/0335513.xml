        <p>''Go fight City Hall'' usually means, ''Don't bother, you can't win.'' But the owners of 184 cooperative apartments at 50 Lexington Avenue fought - and won - and now may get up to $10 million in tax abatements. The dispute involves their claim to 10 years of abatements under New York City's 421a program. The developer, Behrouz Ben Hakimian, broke ground for the building in October 1985, a month before the city ended 421a abatements for luxury developments in Manhattan below 96th Street. The program, which continues elsewhere in Manhattan and in the other boroughs, encourages apartment construction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hakimian insisted he had met the cutoff deadline of Nov. 29, 1985, but city officials who visited the site at the corner of East 24th Street after that date reported finding no foundation work going on. Consequently, they denied a tax-abatement application filed in 1988 after the building was finished.</p>
        <p>The developer and co-op corporation sued and last month State Supreme Court Justice Leonard N. Cohen ruled in their favor, ordering the city to repay $1.4 million in taxes and interest already collected. Joseph I. Lauer of the city's Law Department said the decision was being reviewed.</p>
