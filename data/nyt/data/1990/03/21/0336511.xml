        <p>LEAD: The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum announced today that it would offer a $1 million reward for information leading to the recovery of the 12 masterpieces stolen from the museum on Sunday in what is believed to be the largest art theft in history.</p>
        <p>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum announced today that it would offer a $1 million reward for information leading to the recovery of the 12 masterpieces stolen from the museum on Sunday in what is believed to be the largest art theft in history.</p>
        <p>Anne Hawley, the museum's director, said the offer was made possible by a highly unusual agreement between Sotheby's and Christie's, the art auction houses, which will underwrite the reward.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hawley said the museum had decided to offer the reward at the urging of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ''The F.B.I. told us this would be very helpful in the investigation and said that $1 million is a magical number,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I am extraordinarily grateful to Sotheby's and Christie's,'' Ms. Hawley said. ''The museum's concern is to get the art back. It is part of our heritage, and it's been plundered.''</p>
        <p>In the break-in, two thieves dressed as police officers took a dozen works valued at more than $200 million, including paintings by Vermeer, Rembrandt, Degas and Manet as well as a Chinese bronze beaker from the Shang dynasty of 1200 to 1000 B.C.</p>
        <p>The Gardner Museum, housed in an Italianate edifice built by its namesake at the turn of the century, is considered one of the world's finest private museums. The museum disclosed on Monday that it did not have theft insurance, partly because of the cost, which would be greater than its $2.8 million annual operating budget, and partly because of the strict terms of Mrs. Gardner's will, which bars the museum from acquiring any new or substitute artworks, even in the case of a robbery.</p>
        <p>'A Horrifying Thing'</p>
        <p>Diana D. Brooks, the president of Sotheby's Inc. in New York, said that as far as she knew the offer by her concern and by Christie's was the first time either house had helped a museum put up a reward for stolen art. Mrs. Brooks said Sotheby's had decided to underwrite the reward after being approached by the Gardner Museum on Monday.</p>
        <p>''It was such a horrifying thing for the art world, and it was our feeling we were in a position to help make a difference,'' Mrs. Brooks said.</p>
        <p>Daniel Davison, the chairman of Christie's of North America in New York, said his firm and Sotheby's had agreed to act jointly today after being told by the F.B.I. that ''a quick offer could be crucial, before these things get out of the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davison and Mrs. Brooks said that they would now approach some individuals for help in underwriting the reward, but that they were prepared to foot the bill alone if none were forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Previous Attempt Reported</p>
        <p>A few other details about the theft emerged today. Paul Cavanagh, an F.B.I. agent in Boston, said the two museum security guards who let the thieves in, after being told they were there to check on an alarm, were handcuffed and tied with tape. The guards were then put in separate rooms, where they were not able to observe how the robbers left. It is not known if the robbers had an accomplice outside or how they made their getaway, Mr. Cavanagh said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanagh and museum officials said they had no information to substantiate a report in today's Boston Globe that the thieves may have tried to enter the Gardner two weeks earlier by staging a disturbance outside the museum.</p>
        <p>Quoting unnamed investigators, The Globe said three people had taken part in the incident, with one pounding on the door, begging to be let in to get away from attackers. It was the same door that the thieves used on Sunday. But when the guard on duty refused to let the man in, he got in a car and drove off with the two supposed assailants, the paper said.</p>
        <p>During the robbery on Sunday, the thieves managed to disable the museum's security system, in which each artwork was connected to a central monitoring post but not directly to the police, a law enforcement official said. The official said the thieves were knowledgeable enough about the security system to remove videocassettes that would have shown them moving around the building.</p>
        <p>'Eclectic Character' of Thefts</p>
        <p>Some art experts contended today that the thieves' main focus was on the Dutch masters, while others suggested that the Chinese bronze may hold a hidden clue.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen a theft which had such an eclectic character,'' said Evan Turner, the director of the Cleveland Museum of Art. The pieces taken fell into three categories: the Dutch masters, including ''The Concert,'' by Vermeer, and three Rembrandts; French Impressionists, including five paintings by Degas and one by Manet; and the Chinese bronze vessel.</p>
        <p>''The choice of the Shang bronze is astonishing,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It's completely out of context.''</p>
        <p>The bronze, in the form known as a ku, was also an unusual choice because it is dark brown; its ancient green patina was removed before Mrs. Gardner purchased it. Traditional Chinese collectors preferred their bronzes and jades without the encrustation that formed when the pieces lay buried for centuries, said James Watt, the Brooke Astor Senior Curator in the department of Asian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In recent years, as many bronzes have been unearthed, Western collectors have preferred to keep the green patina, showing the pieces' antiquity.</p>
        <p>The theft of the bronze suggested to some experts that a wealthy Asian collector might be behind the robbery.</p>
        <p>But Robert Bagley, a professor of art at Princeton University and an authority on Chinese bronzes, said that the Gardner's bronze was not an especially valuable piece and that because it was sitting on a table near one of the stolen Rembrandts, the more likely explanation was that ''the thieves just saw it on their way out.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe they thought it would be a good thing to put flowers in,'' Professor Bagley said.</p>
