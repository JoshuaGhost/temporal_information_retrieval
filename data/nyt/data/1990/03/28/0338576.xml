        <p>LEAD: When rating agencies assess state and local governments with a letter grade, they are doing more than just issuing an opinion. They are shaping the interest rates governments will pay for years, even decades into the future.</p>
        <p>When rating agencies assess state and local governments with a letter grade, they are doing more than just issuing an opinion. They are shaping the interest rates governments will pay for years, even decades into the future.</p>
        <p>In the case of New York State, which seemed to shun repeated warnings by executives at Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation to bring its budget closer to balance, the rating reduction announced Monday by Standard &amp; Poor's is certain to result in higher interest payments for state bonds and the myriad of state agencies that sell bonds with state backing.</p>
        <p>Higher interest rates on bonds the state sells to pay for long-term projects such as roads, office buildings and environmental projects mean there will be less money available for day-to-day expenses like workers' salaries or education aid payments to hundreds of school districts around the state.</p>
        <p>Rates Still Rising</p>
        <p>Exactly how much interest payments will increase is not known. But early reports from traders on Wall Street are that interest rates for state bonds are still rising after substantial increases earlier this year when the state's budget problems became apparent.</p>
        <p>In the first full day of trading after Standard &amp; Poor's cut the state rating to A from AA-, yields on long-term bonds have increased about five-hundredths to seven-hundredths of a percentage point, and prices fell about $6 per $1,000 bond. For state agency bonds, prices fell roughly $7.50. One typical long-term issue, the 7.2 percent issue due in 2020, was offered to small individual investors yesterday at $994.50 per $1,000 bond to yield about 7.25 percent, down from about $1,000 a day earlier.</p>
        <p>For 10-year state bonds, yields of 7.10 percent were barely lower than the 7.31 percent yield for a widely watched index of 20 municipal bonds compiled by The Bond Buyer, a trade publication. In June 1988, 10-year state bonds were 6.70 percent, compared with 7.73 percent for the Bond Buyer Index.</p>
        <p>Significance Assessed</p>
        <p>James F. Lynch, president of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter, said, ''The rating cut is more significant for the state agencies whose ratings fell to the triple-B category than for the state.'' He noted that many municipal bond funds do not invest in bonds rated in the triple-B category but do buy bonds in the slightly higher-quality single-A category. State agency bonds typically carry slightly lower ratings than the state's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said yields of 10-year state bonds have risen in the last year by about 35-hundredths of a percentage point relative to 10-year bonds of top-rated states with triple-A ratings. Assuming New York State sells $500 million of bonds this year with an average life of about 10 years, the extra 35-hundredths of a percentage point would raise its interest payments by about $17.5 million over the life of the bonds. But the cost is likely to be far higher because other state agencies will also be paying higher interest rates.</p>
        <p>So far, the additional expense of higher interest rates does not loom large in the $51 billion state budget proposed for the coming year.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the state and its tax-supported agencies sell $6.6 billion of bonds over the next four years as planned, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said, an increase of 20-hundredths of a percentage point in the state's borrowing costs would increase the interest payments by $180 million over the 25-year life of the bonds.</p>
