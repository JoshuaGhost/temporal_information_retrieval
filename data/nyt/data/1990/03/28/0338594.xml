        <p>LEAD: Eastern Airlines told its creditors yesterday that its inability to win back business travelers had cut its revenues and that it could therefore no longer guarantee to pay them 50 cents on the dollar as promised.</p>
        <p>Eastern Airlines told its creditors yesterday that its inability to win back business travelers had cut its revenues and that it could therefore no longer guarantee to pay them 50 cents on the dollar as promised.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with unsecured creditors in Manhattan, Philip J. Bakes, the president and chief executive of Eastern, painted a gloomy picture of Eastern's attempt to emerge from bankruptcy protection. He estimated that in the first quarter Eastern would lose $330 million, which is $185 million more than what the carrier had predicted in January. But he said he was still optimistic that the airline could become viable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakes said that to save money Eastern would reduce the number of flights it planned to add this summer by 12 percent, diminish the health benefits of retirees, and ask the bankruptcy court to impose a new contract on its pilots and machinists, a step that would save about $80 million a year in labor costs.</p>
        <p>Machinists Still on Strike</p>
        <p>Eastern's machinists are still on strike; the pilots and flight attendants called off their strikes last November. The small number of machinists who have returned to work would be covered by any new contract, but it is unclear as to what effect this would have on their strike.</p>
        <p>Eastern has been able to get back into the air after a strike by its three unions that began a year ago, using pilots and flight attendants who returned to work, as well as new employees hired at much lower salaries. But the airline, a subsidiary of the Texas Air Corporation, has had little luck in recapturing former customers and it has not been able to shake an image hurt by two years of conflict with its unions.</p>
        <p>Some analysts think that Eastern has shrunk to such a small size that it can no longer compete with carriers like Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.</p>
        <p>Kevin Murphy, the airline analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Company, said Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air, might eventually have no choice but to fold what remained of Eastern into Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other airline subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Although the unsecured creditors, which include the major airplane and engine makers, have considered a liquidation, that could be a hazardous course because throwing so many assets on the market at once could greatly lessen their value. There is also the problem of Eastern's pension fund: it is underfunded by about $1 billion, which could force the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to seek to attach Eastern's assets to make up the shortfall.</p>
        <p>Eastern still has more than $700 million in an escrow account that it can use to buy more time to rebuild if the bankruptcy court allows this. The account would grow by $350 million if the sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to American goes through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakes said in an interview that it was taking much longer for the carrier to win back the business traveler. He added that many people had misconceptions about the airline. He said that in a recent survey of Eastern's frequent fliers, who tended to be business travelers, most thought that the airline had about half as many flights out of Atlanta as it did before the strike. But actually, Mr. Bakes said, Eastern now had more flights out of Atlanta than before the strike. The carrier has made Atlanta its main hub.</p>
        <p>There is also the perception that Eastern is about to run out of cash when it actually has large reserves and a bankruptcy court judge, Burton R. Lifland, who is firmly committed to helping Eastern survive.</p>
        <p>Passengers Steered Away</p>
        <p>And some travel agents now routinely steer passengers away from Eastern even though it may be offering lower fares than competitors. ''Airlines are very much like banks,'' Mr. Bakes said. ''Public confidence is very important.''</p>
        <p>The carrier has been able to attract leisure travelers with low fares introduced earlier this year. Its planes were 57 percent full in January and 65.8 percent full in February, with a similar figure this month.</p>
        <p>But while those figures are strong, Eastern needs more of the business travelers who tend to pay full fare or a higher discount fare.</p>
        <p>The daily barrage of criticism from the striking machinists' union does not help. Yesterday, for example, the union disclosed a memorandum from the airline's customer service division saying that high turnover among ramp workers was making it difficult to build ''proficiency and competency levels in employees new to the airline.'' The memorandum said the airline had to train 3,500 people to fill 900 jobs on the ramp in the last six months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakes acknowledged that high turnover had been a problem at Eastern's hub in Atlanta and that the airline had decided that instead of contracting out the work it would hire workers and provide them with benefits like free travel. He said turnover had subsequently been greatly reduced.</p>
        <p>He added that the airline was reducing its cash needs as it rebuilt and would need to draw $80 million from its escrow accounts for April, May and June, compared with $110 million for February and March.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 29, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Eastern Airlines misidentified the period during which the carrier expects to lose $330 million. It is the entire year, not the first quarter.</p>
