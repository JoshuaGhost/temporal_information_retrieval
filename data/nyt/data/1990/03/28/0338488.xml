        <p>rrWith headlights, brake lights, warning lights and instrument panels, a typical car can have as many as 80 light bulbs, all consuming power, all gradually wearing out. The General Electric Company is developing a way to replace them all with one central lighting system.</p>
        <p>With the Light Engine, which G. E. expects to introduce before the end of the decade, light is ''piped'' from a star-shaped lamp through a fiber-optic distribution system to whatever application the driver chooses. There are no wires, and no bulbs to burn out. The cost is expected to be comparable to that of conventional automotive lighting systems.</p>
        <p>The lamp would employ the technology used in stadium and street lighting, known as discharge forward lighting.</p>
        <p>In such lamps, electrical current flows between two electrodes encased in a sealed tube filled with metal hallide gas, heating up the gas and producing light, rather than through a filament. Because there is no filament to heat up and melt, the lamp can operate at far higher temperatures, producing a brighter light, while consuming less power. G. E. says the Light Engine will use the power of just three of today's halogen headlights.</p>
        <p>The company expects individual headlights using discharge forward lighting to be in automobiles before 1995. They have four times the efficiency of incandescent bulbs, and allow far smaller headlights, said John Davenport, manager of concept development for G. E. Lighting.</p>
        <p>The Light Engine concept allows the car's front lights to be less than one inch high - a boon to designers seeking more aerodynamic shapes. The system is also expected to cut manufacturers' assembly costs  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
