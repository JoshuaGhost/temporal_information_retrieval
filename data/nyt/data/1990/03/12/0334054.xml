        <p>LEAD: Deborah Hay isn't an easy performer to watch or to understand. Her dances, like her stage presence, tend to be on the gnomic side. There is no man, for instance, in ''The Man Who Grew Common in Wisdom,'' a new work presented on Friday night at the Warren Street Performance Loft.</p>
        <p>Deborah Hay isn't an easy performer to watch or to understand. Her dances, like her stage presence, tend to be on the gnomic side. There is no man, for instance, in ''The Man Who Grew Common in Wisdom,'' a new work presented on Friday night at the Warren Street Performance Loft.</p>
        <p>Equally mysterious are such program-note allusions as ''remaining positionless about the nature of wisdom'' and a performance ''tempered by resourcefulness,'' although they share the dance's intuitive rightness. But Ms. Hay is such a strong, sure and seasoned artist that one is willing, as always, to follow her fearlessly into her luminous world. The effort of attention is repaid.</p>
        <p>The three-part solo was set to an electronic score by Ellen Fullman that had much of the dance's vibrant stillness and antic, ultimately unsettling humor. Ms. Hay, now based in Austin, Tex., is a leading post-modernist of Judson Dance Theater-vintage whose work still has something of the tai chi ritual exercises that influenced her early on. In ''The Navigator,'' Ms. Hay draws the viewer irrevocably into a timeless, slow-moving world whose major events are the turning-in of a foot, the flutter of hands, a tilt, a stamp - and the gradual wrinkling of the stiff cotton top and pants she wears.</p>
        <p>In ''The Gardener,'' Ms. Hay might have stepped out of an Indonesian monkey dance. It is a slightly nutty solo, with small hops and bourrees punctuated by abrupt yelps. Her grin in that second solo becomes fixed in the third section, ''The Aviator,'' a flurry of quick, broken trots and abrupt arabesques that ends frighteningly with Ms. Hay gaping and cross-eyed as if in a seizure, then going limp on the floor. The Aviator, the program says, is a fool, and there is something of the divine fool here.</p>
        <p>That third section begins with a bit of stage magic - a matter of newly hung white cloth drops and a surprise entrance - that epitomizes the mystery and surprise of Ms. Hay's work. Susan Norwood designed Ms. Hays's caps and her giddy, clownish costume for the third solo. The lighting was by Bob Beswick.</p>
        <p>''The Man Who Grew Common in Wisdom'' will be repeated on Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Performance Loft (46 Warren Street).</p>
