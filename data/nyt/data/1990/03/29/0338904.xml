        <p>LEAD: The Knicks got a shocking reminder tonight that their deep-rooted problems have not been solved. They had one of their poorest first-half performances of the season, falling behind by 18 points to the Nets, a team that had lost 11 consecutive games. And in the process, the Knicks were badly outrebounded, badly outplayed, and badly outhustled by a team that has much less at stake than they do.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The Knicks got a shocking reminder tonight that their deep-rooted problems have not been solved.

And in the process, the Knicks were badly outrebounded, badly outplayed, and badly outhustled by a team that has much less at stake than they do.</p>
        <p>The Knicks got a shocking reminder tonight that their deep-rooted problems have not been solved. They had one of their poorest first-half performances of the season, falling behind by 18 points to the Nets, a team that had lost 11 consecutive games. And in the process, the Knicks were badly outrebounded, badly outplayed, and badly outhustled by a team that has much less at stake than they do.</p>
        <p>Not even a furious fourth-quarter rally could save the Knicks from falling to New Jersey, 106-101, before 18,438 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. The loss dropped the third-place Knicks four games behind Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division, and it was their seventh loss in their last eight games.</p>
        <p>If there is any reason to feel the Knicks' fortunes will change soon, it it not evident from listening to their coach and to their players. All of them seem puzzled, grappling unsuccessfully for a solution to their slide.</p>
        <p>Inconsistent Play</p>
        <p>''The club came back in the second half, but for some reason, we don't seem to understand we need to give that kind of effort for the entire game,'' said Stu Jackson, New York's coach. ''Personally, I have to take some accountability for that. But we just won't learn that we need each other, we need to play for each other, and we need to play hard, night in and night out to be successful, especially with the injury to Charles Oakley.''</p>
        <p>For the Nets, it was an emotional victory, especially for their assistant coach, Butch Beard, who coached all but the first 1 minute 31 seconds. Bill Fitch, the head coach, was ejected by Referee Joe Crawford at the 10:29 mark of the first quarter, perhaps the quickest exit of Fitch's career. Fitch was arguing about a quick second foul called against Sam Bowie, and Crawford wasted no time giving Fitch two technical fouls, an automatic ejection.</p>
        <p>''I told the players to keep their composure,'' Beard said. ''It was an excellent team effort. We were mentally into the ball game. Hopefully we will grow from this.''</p>
        <p>But the Nets almost self-destructed down the stretch. The game appeared to be over when Gerald Wilkins missed two free throws with 2:37 remaining and the Knicks trailing by 101-90. But after Kenny Walker scored on a tip-in, Bowie fumbled a pass in the backcourt and Wilkins picked it up and dunked, pulling the Knicks within 101-94. Then Bowie made another mistake, when his long inbounds pass was intercepted by Maurice Cheeks. Wilkins made a 3-point shot from the corner, pulling New York within 101-97 with 1:39 left.</p>
        <p>After a Nets turnover, Patrick Ewing (17 points) pump-faked and scored over Chris Dudley while being fouled. But Ewing, whose club-record streak of consecutive games with at least 20 points ended at 28, missed the free throw and the Knicks still trailed, 101-99. After Bowie missed a jump shot on New Jersey's next possession, the Knicks had a chance to tie. But Wilkins bowled over Pete Myers on a drive to the basket for an offensive foul with 19.4 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Purvis Short of the Nets was fouled with 14.8 seconds remaining, and he made both free throws to put the Nets ahead by 4. Wilkins answered with a driving layup with 10.2 seconds remaining, then Chris Morris (24 points, 15 rebounds) made one of two free throws to make the score, 104-101, with 8 seconds remaining. After a timeout, Wilkins missed a long 3-point shot from behind the key, then Ewing and Myers were tied up fighting for the rebound, forcing a jump ball with 4 seconds remaining. Ewing tipped the ball to Dennis Hopson by mistake with 2.6 seconds left, and Hopson made 2 free throws to seal the victory.</p>
        <p>''I think it shows a lack of maturity that we didn't come our harder tonight,'' said Trent Tucker, the Knicks' guard in a quiet locker room. ''We needed this win. We were expected to win. This hurts badly.''</p>
        <p>Bowie, the Nets' starting center, agreed Wednesday to a new five-year contract worth $13 million. Bowie will earn $2 million next season, $2.5 million the next two seasons, and $3 million during the final two years of his contract. The deal will be announced officially at a news conference Thursday morning.</p>
