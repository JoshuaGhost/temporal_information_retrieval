        <p>Jad Fair and Kramer, who brought a six-piece band to Wetlands on Monday night, are kindred souls on rock's scruffy fringes. Mr. Fair, who has led the band Half Japanese since the late 1970's, is one of rock's last professional amateurs; he writes blunt, seemingly artless lyrics, sings them in a nasal whine and scratches out scraggly notes and chords from his guitar. Kramer, a bassist, produces albums for his own Shimmy-Disc label that treat rock as a jumbled heritage and a shared joke that might or might not be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>Their set at Wetlands - part of a fifth-anniversary celebration for Option, the Los Angeles-based magazine devoted to independent music - was noisy, funny and only slightly self-indulgent. The band crashed and stomped through songs by Mr. Fair and Kramer as well as rock oldies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fair sings about love, sex and death - nothing trivial - with a teen-ager's mischievous glee, imagining ''Cheerleaders Wild Weekend'' or ''sex in your parents' bed.'' He and the band bashed through some oldies and quizzically examined others; he recited the Beatles' ''Help'' in a plaintive voice while Kramer sang the melody in a distant falsetto over percussive taps and bonks from the band. Between Kramer's fuzz-toned bass, George Cartwright's squeals and squiggles of alto saxophone and Steve Shelley's muscular drumming, most of the songs turned into jaunty, raucous rockers, with loose ends on display. ''Anybody could do it,'' Kramer said as the band left the stage - but not everybody does.</p>
