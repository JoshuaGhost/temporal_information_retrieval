        <p>LEAD: It is lunchtime, and Juan Saenz, budding fast-food mogul, is toiling in his catering truck. Fingering a thick wad of $1 bills, he takes three orders for burritos and calls them out to his wife, Mari, furiously working the griddle.</p>
        <p>It is lunchtime, and Juan Saenz, budding fast-food mogul, is toiling in his catering truck. Fingering a thick wad of $1 bills, he takes three orders for burritos and calls them out to his wife, Mari, furiously working the griddle.</p>
        <p>Half a dozen customers, chattering in Spanish, crowd the sidewalk waiting for lunch. The tiny restaurant, La Jerezana (for Mr. Saenz's hometown in Mexico), is doing good business today on Kenter Avenue in Brentwood, a tony West Los Angeles community.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, he said, they will stay a while before moving on. Perhaps in a few months, though, they will be forced to move on permanently.</p>
        <p>A clash of Anglo and Hispanic cultures has erupted here over the issue of mobile vendors like La Jerezana, a large truck that prowls the streets in search of hungry workers.</p>
        <p>Complaints that trucks like Mr. Saenz's litter streets and cause traffic hazards in residential neighborhoods have prompted the Los Angeles City Council to consider strict new rules for restaurants on wheels.</p>
        <p>Catering trucks are big business in Los Angeles, where the drive-through window at McDonald's often does not seem fast enough to qualify as fast-food. Over the years, companies with stables of 50 catering trucks or more have built up lucrative routes that include daily 10- to 30-minute stops at businesses, warehouses, construction sites and movie-shooting locations.</p>
        <p>But in the last few years, a new breed of independent owners, predominantly Hispanic, have carved out a small niche serving their countrymen who work in residential districts like Brentwood as gardeners, swimming pool cleaners and painters.</p>
        <p>At lunchtime along Kenter Avenue and other streets, catering trucks attract dozens of workers in an hour. The customers come by foot or pick-up truck from jobs at nearby houses for the convenient, inexpensive food and the familiar atmosphere. Patrons say the trucks remind them of the town squares in their home villages where street food is consumed.</p>
        <p>Local residents say the restaurants on wheels should not be allowed to operate in front of homes.</p>
        <p>''Some of the trucks are setting up for six or eight hours a day,'' said Susan Young, president of the Brentwood Homeowners' Association. ''It's causing a safety problem; people can't get out of their driveways. Trash is left behind. There needs to be some kind of controls before tempers start to get heated.''</p>
        <p>The complaints won quick support from the City Council, which is scheduled to vote this spring to limit the time catering trucks may remain at a particular location, or within a half-mile radius, to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>''That's a good start, but I'd like to see more,'' said Nate Holden, who is chairman of the Council's transportation committee. ''I'd like to go a little further and say they can go to job sites only. I don't like to see those trucks out there dumping trash into the streets.''</p>
        <p>Marvin Braude, another Councilman, said the trucks also stole business from established restaurants that pay rent and utilities and serve their communities continuously. ''It's unfair competition,'' he said. Established catering truck companies have no problem with the proposed law because they make most of their stops in under 30 minutes. But the independent owners say they need more time.</p>
        <p>''If this law passes, it's going to cause trouble,'' said Mr. Saenz, who bought his truck four months ago after working in the kitchen of Scandia, a well-known Beverly Hills restaurant, for 20 years.</p>
        <p>''I need to stay in one place a long time,'' he said. ''The gardeners, when they come for lunch - some come at 11 o'clock; some come at noon. It's better to stay here two hours.''</p>
        <p>In January about 50 trucks circled Los Angeles City Hall in protest of the proposed law.</p>
        <p>''Every day it's clean here; it's good food,'' said Gabriel Padilla, standing next to his truck on Kenter Avenue. He said he could serve 50 to 60 customers in two hours.</p>
        <p>Enrique Robledo, who parks a catering truck called Porky's for seven hours a day outside a supermarket in Wilmington, a predominently Hispanic area of Los Angeles, said many truck owners could be forced out of business by the law.</p>
        <p>''I would lose about $80 to $100 or more per day,'' he said. ''We sell about $200 or $250 per day now. If I were earning $80 a day, I would just have to get rid of the truck.''</p>
