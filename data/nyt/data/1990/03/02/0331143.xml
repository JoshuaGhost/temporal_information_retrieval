        <p>La Salle, a nationally ranked team with the nation's longest winning streak at 18 games and one of the game's best players in Lionel Simmons, appears unbeatable. Except to Speedy Morris, who happens to coach the 13th-ranked Explorers.</p>
        <p>''We can lose to anybody,'' Morris said today, one day before the start of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament at the Knickerbocker Arena.</p>
        <p>The chances are against that happening this weekend. La Salle, which does not play until Saturday, compiled a 26-1 record during the regular season and went 16-0 in the conference. Simmons, a 6-foot-6-inch senior forward not only leads the conference in scoring and rebounding, but he is the first college player to score more than 3,000 points and grab 1,000 points in a career.</p>
        <p>The four-day tournament begins Friday with four first-round games, followed by the quarterfinals Saturday and the semifinals Sunday. The final is Monday night. The winner gets an automatic bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.</p>
