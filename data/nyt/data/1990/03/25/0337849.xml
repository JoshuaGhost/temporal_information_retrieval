        <p>LOOSE JAM. By Wayne Wilson. (Delacorte, $17.95.) Poor Henry Brown. Standing on his redwood porch in yuppified Morro Bay, Calif., this Vietnam veteran, sometime guitarist, record-store manager and reluctant hero of Wayne Wilson's ''Loose Jam'' sees his old Army buddy Miles Duckworth coming right for him. Miles, a one-legged casualty of the war and the 60's, is ''humping along between those crutches like some strung-out apostle with a load of bad news that just couldn't wait.'' The news is that a maniacal veteran, nursing a grudge from the war, has found Miles and wants his blood - and maybe Henry's too. Miles, who once played a mean piano (''the voice of a generation,'' said the album notes), is disgusted by the new life Henry has made for himself in their 15 years apart. So he helps Henry lose his job as ''a flunky for a bunch of . . . suits'' and nearly destroys his house. Henry and Martha, his beloved, are compelled to help Miles escape to Ventura, but the wrathful veteran, known for more than half the book only as the Policy Man, tracks them down for the novel's predictably violent denouement. And, in the process, what might have been a series of bluesy riffs on redemption or reconciliation, or the inevitability of retribution, turns into a plodding arpeggio. In this first novel, the characters mouth cliches that recall the worst excesses of Kerouac, and there is very little that is evocative, insightful or sympathetic. The fractured plot cuts between the here-and-now, the way-back-when and the just-a-few-hours-ago, and coincidences wait in ambush like snipers. But the brief excursions back to Vietnam are diverting, if only because they distract us from the dreariness of Mr. Wilson's boozy, dope-filled New Age California.</p>
