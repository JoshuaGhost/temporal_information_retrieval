        <p>LEAD: Why does one listen to old recordings, especially to very old ones with their surface noise and low-end reproduction of sound? One potent reason is the simple lure of history. Records now reach back far beyond the memories of even the most senior concertgoers, and to the extent that musical interpretation is an important sphere of endeavor, its history is worth understanding.</p>
        <p>Why does one listen to old recordings, especially to very old ones with their surface noise and low-end reproduction of sound? One potent reason is the simple lure of history. Records now reach back far beyond the memories of even the most senior concertgoers, and to the extent that musical interpretation is an important sphere of endeavor, its history is worth understanding.</p>
        <p>Certainly there is an interesting history to be studied; styles of playing and singing have changed drastically over the course of the century. The oft-heard generalization that our current symphony orchestras and virtuosos are playing in (mired in, some critics charge) ''19th-century style'' or ''Romantic style'' gives one indication of just how little this history is understood even by some people who care about interpretation. An excellent, concise discussion of the changes from 1900 to 1940 is to be found in Robert Philip's chapter in the new handbook ''Performance Practice: Music After 1600'' (Norton). But the best way to understand them is by hearing.</p>
        <p>Beyond this there is the individual interpretive power of great musicians whose performances have been captured in sound. For virtuosos of earlier centuries we eagerly read biographies and ear-witness accounts, but for Joachim, Paderewski, Melba, Caruso and many others we can be our own ear-witnesses: and again that is the best way. It might have been feared that this would become harder to do with the transition to compact disk: Now, even early stereo recordings are being reissued as ''historical,'' ''legendary'' and so forth, and one could imagine the really primitive recordings vanishing into a kind of scholars-only region of prehistory. But luckily, something like the opposite seems to be happening, at least for the moment. The shiny new disks have lifted at least some part of the commercial curse that used to hang over early recordings, and ''78's'' are appearing faster, in better sound and with wider distribution than they did during the comparable period during the first few years of the turnover to LP. There are still important gaps to be filled, but there is every reason to expect that they may be. And in the meantime, one can already hope to get a decently broad, representative view of how music was interpreted at the opposite end of our turbulent century.</p>
        <p>For anyone who would like to do just that in the sphere of instrumental music here are some recommendations for a basic library of 40 or fewer CD's. I have set no hard-and-fast dividing lines for inclusion, but the idea was to emphasize the artists farthest from our own contemporaries chronologically and stylistically. A few of the performers listed here lived on to make LP recordings, but most did not (or not very successfully).</p>
        <p>Several companies are responsible for these reissues, but one is clearly in the lead. Pearl Records and its specialist line, Opal, built an adventurous orchestral and solo instrumental catalogue on LP and have been transferring it (and adding to it) at a lively pace on CD. These British labels are distributed in the United States by Qualiton Imports in Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>Piano</p>
        <p>Piano playing (especially Chopin playing) has changed as radically as anything over the course of the century, and there is an abundance of performances now readily available on CD to open the ears of concertgoers and aspiring pianists who are willing to listen past the surface noise and to try to understand ways of interpreting that are, by currently prevalent pedagogical opinions, ''wrong.''</p>
        <p>The oldest is Vladimir de Pachmann (1848-1933). Late in life he became something of a comic, eccentric figure, but he was not always: the performances gathered on Opal CD 9840, dating back to 1907, show a player of marvelous lightness, spontaneity and un-self-conscious naturalness. Fluency was the outstanding characteristic: not sheer speed, but a way of breezing through a piece that made everything sound unconsidered, unlabored, yet at the same time perfectly proportioned. Raoul Pugno (1852-1914) was a multi-faceted and important conductor, composer and pianist. His 17 solo records (made in 1903 and all gathered on Opal CD 9836) present an initial obstacle: a faint vibrato caused by defective recording equipment. But virtuosity, taste, charm and fire are abundantly apparent. His repertory is nicely varied, with five Chopin selections forming the largest segment; the free ''bel canto'' treatment of the F-sharp Nocturne is especially memorable.</p>
        <p>The most celebrated Chopin interpreter of those years, and still the most spiritually comprehensive one on records, is Ignace Jan Paderewski (1860-1941). He had the lightness and refinement that were typical in his day but are out of style now, a true command of rubato (to too many pianists rubato simply means hesitations and ritards; to Paderewski is was a much more vital kind of give and take) and an incomparably beautiful singing line. But best of all he had resources of poetry, of melancholy, of surging nobility, that capture the suffering soul of Poland. Pearl GEMM 9323 (encouragingly entitled ''Volume 1'') offers 17 works recorded from 1912 to 1937, when the 77-year-old pianist, though his technique has become quite rocky, rises to the Heroic Polonaise in inspired fashion.</p>
        <p>Moriz Rosenthal (1862-1946; Pearl GEMM 9339) did not rise to that kind of interpretive height, but he had a genius for finding the surprising nuance or turn of phrase that would cast new light on a passage (the Etude Op. 10 No. 1 always raises eyebrows when pianists hear it, but it has more life than any other version I know), and he was a great virtuoso. Ferruccio Busoni (1866-1924) was both that and an intellectually probing artist of the highest stature. He made very few recordings - they are all gathered on Pearl GEMM 9347, with room left over for Busoni compositions played by his pupil Egon Petri - but I cannot think of a more interesting and challenging half-hour's worth of piano playing. The serene, exploratory fantasy in the first prelude and fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier, the demonic variety in Chopin's E minor etude, the breadth and dash in Liszt's 13th Hungarian Rhapsody: endlessly fascinating.</p>
        <p>I also recommend Pearl's compilation of the early American recordings of Alfred Cortot (1877-1962; GEMM 9386). They are more secure and virtuosic than the familiar, frequently reissued European recordings, and they document an intensely creative artist of a more modern pianistic sensibility. Artur Schnabel (1882-1951) made his enormously influential career as the apostle of the Viennese classics. He was a wonderfully vital, imaginative pianist, and the Arabesque label has embarked on an admirable CD series including (thus far) all his Schubert and Mozart recordings and his first series of Beethoven concertos. For a single representative disk - a starter - Z6571, with Schubert's ''Trout'' Quintet and A major sonata (D. 959) would do well.</p>
        <p>Strings</p>
        <p>Some differences in string playing ''now'' and ''then'' can be easily summarized: the older players used considerably less (and narrower) vibrato and far more portamento (connecting notes by sliding the finger along the string) than their counterparts today. These differences, especially the second, take some getting used to, especially for players who have been carefully taught to do the opposite. But the effort is worthwhile: the style has great advantages. Harder to define is the freedom and panache the best of these old players bring to the Romantic repertory.</p>
        <p>For the earliest artists - starting with Joseph Joachim (1831-1907) and Pablo de Sarasate (1844-1908) - the CD collector should have Pearl's ''Great Virtuosos'' anthologies on GEMM 9101 and 9102. These are not completely satisfactory jobs, and the Opal LP edition of the two just mentioned would make a better addition to the CD catalogue. Still, the anthologies have some fascinating and wonderful playing by Eugene Ysaye, Marie Hall and others.</p>
        <p>I have gotten great pleasure from the songful and expert playing of Maud Powell (1867-1920) on MPF-1, the first of three CD's issued by the foundation that bears the name of this once-famous American violinist (the address is 5333 North 26th Street, Arlington, Va., 22207). A spirited Bach bourree, two lovely Gluck melodies and an abbreviated version of De Beriot's Seventh Concerto are the highlights. Carl Flesch is best remembered as a teacher of dozens of successful players and an author both influential (in pedagogy) and amusing (as a memoirist), but he was a player of great authority and an important transitional figure in style and technique. Symposium's three-disk set (Symposium 1032) preserves commercial recordings and live performances.</p>
        <p>Bronislaw Huberman (1882-1947) could play brusquely, even harshly, but he had a unique sense of character, a special way of marshaling rhythm and tone color to illustrate the peculiarities of each work. He also had a great capacity for collaborating with a conductor, as with William Steinberg in the ebb and flow of the Tchaikovsky Canzonetta (on Pearl GEMM 9332, with Lalo, Mendelssohn, Vieuxtemps and Bruch) or with George Szell in the angular rusticity of the Beethoven concerto's finale (on EMI/Angel's ''Great Recordings'' series, CDH 7 63194, with the ''Kreutzer'' sonata).</p>
        <p>Two whose rich, vibrant sound did much (in different ways) to shape new ideals of tone were Mischa Elman (1891-1967) and the phenomenally popular Fritz Kreisler (1875-1962). Elman's generous Romanticism is well captured on Pearl GEMM 9388 in concertos of Tchaikovsky and Bach; Kreisler is already the subject of more than a dozen CD reissues, among which I confess a fondness for the oft-criticized Beethoven sonatas (GEMM 9330, 9354); it's true the violinist was past his prime in the mid-1930's, but there is a songful grace to these recordings that is special. For a good selection of the celebrated Kreisler encore fare, try GEMM 9324 - but I'd like better a reissue of the earlier Victor recordings.</p>
        <p>The century's great figure in cello playing is Pablo Casals (1876-1973), who introduced the great Bach suites into concert life, and whose 1933 recording of them is an essential acquisition for its varied rhythmic and tonal life and its nobility of gesture (Angel/EMI CDH 61028-29). There were excellent pre-Casals cellists, though; the only one thus far well-represented on CD is W. H. Squire (1871-1962), whose beautifully molded reading of the Elgar Cello Concerto is on Novello CD 901. Emanuel Feuermann (1902-1942), the second great ''modern'' cellist, is well represented by the Dvorak concerto and Bloch's ''Schelomo'' on the Philips Legendary Classics series (420 776-2).</p>
        <p>Other Instruments</p>
        <p>Early in the century two instruments were reclaimed for serious classical music by two interpreters of genius: the harpsichord by Wanda Landowska, whose striding rhythm and passionate sense of the fantastic in Bach are beautifully captured on Angel/EMI CDH7 610082, and the guitar by Andres Segovia, whose haunting murmurs and rainbow colorations are in the same series on CDH7 61048 2 and 61049 2.</p>
        <p>Chamber Music</p>
        <p>Most of the great early string quartets still await CD transfer; one that has turned up is the Busch Quartet, in disciplined but warmly felt Schubert on Angel/EMI CDR7 6975 2. The best achievements in chamber music on 78's, however, may have been the work of the Alfred Cortot-Jacques Thibaud-Casals trio. To my ears the supreme example of their work is the active, inquiring interplay of the Schubert B-flat trio. Some might reserve pride of place for the Beethoven ''Archduke.'' The two are paired on EMI/Angel CDH7 61024 2.</p>
        <p>A beautifully chosen and unusual collection of Debussy works (most importantly the three final sonatas) is on Pearl GEMM CD 9348, with Lily Laskine, Maurice Marechal, Robert Casadesus, Thibaud and Cortot among the players. There is something in the French flavor of these works that seems to have become harder to capture after World War II (these recordings are from 1927-1930).</p>
        <p>A magnificent duo recital by Joseph Szigeti and Bela Bartok, given live in 1940 at the Library of Congress and long a classic on LP, has reappeared on Vanguard VCD 72025. This is our only documentation of a long-standing partnership, and the results in Beethoven, Debussy and Bartok's own works are full of fire and creativity.</p>
        <p>Orchestral</p>
        <p>The orchestra was almost impossible to record convincingly before the introduction of microphones in 1925, but some of the earlier experiments (especially with the great Arthur Nikisch) should eventually be reissued on CD. In the meantime, the single most revelatory disk available is probably Angel/EMI's collection of the early (1926-1931) Concertgebouw Orchestra recordings under Willem Mengelberg on CDH7 69956 2. There is the most convincingly shaped Brahms ''Academic Festival Overture'' I know, a stirring ''Tannhauser'' overture, and an adagietto from Mahler's Fifth Symphony that (especially given the conductor's and orchestra's association with the composer) should make everyone think anew about how this piece works and what it means (not to mention what kind of string playing Mahler understood). CD's are also making possible the closest we will ever come to a proper assessment of Arturo Toscanini, who has been overwhelmingly represented by the problematic products of his final years. The luminous orchestral blend and vitalized polyphony for which he was famous are more persuasively present in his New York Philharmonic recordings of 1926-36 (Pearl GEMM 9373, three CD's) and the live BBC series on EMI/Angel (the most recent issue is Wagner and Debussy on CDH7 63044 2).</p>
        <p>Composers</p>
        <p>A special category is formed by composers' documents of their own interpretations of their music. These are not to be taken as definitive statements, of course, but they are often greatly revealing. Ravel, for instance, doesn't quite make his ''Bolero'' work (Philips 420 778-2), but he lets you know he is dead serious about unfolding it slowly and deliberately (there is more Ravel and Prokofiev on this valuable disk). Edward Elgar was a more experienced conductor, and he benefited from the assiduous interest of the Gramophone Company (later EMI); CDH 7 69786 2 has his sumptuous recordings of the cello and violin concertos with Beatrice Harrison and the young, intensely poetic Yehudi Menuhin. Francis Poulenc's tart and pointed early recordings (piano solos, chamber works, and songs with his pre-Pierre Bernac collaborators) are delightfully assembled on Pearl GEMM 9311. GEMM 9366 has Richard Strauss conducting ''Till Eulenspiegel'' and ''Don Juan,'' and RCA 5997-2-RC has Sergei Rachmaninoff in his Second and Third concertos with lush backing from the Philadelphia Orchestra. Both disks are likely to start by seeming surprisingly understated and finish by making most current performances of these works seem exaggerated and bullying.</p>
        <p>And a Wish List</p>
        <p>Finally, a small clutch of suggestions for the busy reissue companies: The few, primitive and enormously important recordings of Grieg, Saint-Saens and Debussy would probably fit on one CD: a natural for Pearl. Josef Hoffman's titanic pianism urgently needs representation. (So does Rachmaninov's playing of other composers.) British orchestras under Albert Coates and Sir Henry Wood give us some of the best available early examples of the older, mellower orchestral sound. Hugo Heermann, born in 1844, is an important and patrician early violinist, too little remembered; ditto for the pianist Alfred Grunfeld and his cellist brother Heinrich, and the most important Beethoven player before Schnabel, Liszt's pupil Frederick Lamond. The good news is that some of these are probably in the works even as I write.</p>
