        <p>LEAD: The prettiest road uniforms in the National Hockey League - blue and white with a fleur-de-lis - are not the only things that make the Quebec Nordiques unusual.</p>
        <p>The prettiest road uniforms in the National Hockey League - blue and white with a fleur-de-lis - are not the only things that make the Quebec Nordiques unusual.</p>
        <p>Like the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League, they are a big league franchise in a small market.</p>
        <p>Unlike most teams in most sports, they are shunned by many players for many reasons.</p>
        <p>Differences in language and culture, combined with a difficult national and provincial tax structure, make Quebec City a challenge for a non-French outsider, even when the team is winning.</p>
        <p>A Solid Last</p>
        <p>But the team has not been winning in recent seasons. The Nordiques' current record of 11-46-6 is good for only 28 points, the worst in the league, and is 22 points behind the team with the next-worst record, the Vancouver Canucks.</p>
        <p>With no chance of a playoff berth again this year, the Nordiques may be on the verge of a fire sale before the trading deadline, March 6.</p>
        <p>Peter Stastny, a center; Michel Goulet, a left wing, and Greg Millen, a goalie, are frequently mentioned in trade rumors involving at least a half-dozen playoff-bound teams.</p>
        <p>Maurice Filion, the Nordique vice president and interim general manager, said this week that he would not mind trading the three players if the price was right.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Marcel Aubut, the team president, was in Europe this week, trying to obtain the rights to Mats Sundin, a center, who is under contract to a team in Sweden. Sundin was chosen by Quebec first over all in the N.H.L. draft last June.</p>
        <p>Shifts in Personnel</p>
        <p>And what's going on behind the bench? Robbie Ftorek, the former Los Angeles Kings coach who led minor league Halifax for most of this season, is now an assistant to Michel Bergeron.</p>
        <p>Ftorek sometimes runs practice by himself, and is very active during games. Two other Quebec assistants, Guy Lapointe and Serge Aubry, were dismissed earlier this season. Is Bergeron worried? ''No problem so far,'' he replied, adding that replacing Lapointe with Ftorek was a decision made above him.</p>
        <p>''It's their option,'' he said of his superiors. ''Guy and I are close. He worked hard. But it's really hard to complain when you have won only 10 games.''</p>
        <p>Ticket Sales Remain High</p>
        <p>In some cities, fans would abandon such a sorry team. But the Nordiques say they sell 97 percent of their tickets, an average of 15,150 a game, the most since they joined the league in 1979-80.</p>
        <p>''Great fans, although they are getting tired of losing,'' said Bergeron, who added that he still closely followed the Rangers, who released him late last season.</p>
        <p>''I have a satellite dish at my house and I see their games,'' Bergeron said. ''Sometimes I get so aggravated when I see Normand Rochefort and David Shaw play. When I was coaching the Rangers, I pushed so hard with Phil Esposito to get them from Quebec. Now, I am back in Quebec, and they are helping the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''I also think they made a heck of a trade to get Bernie Nicholls. Say 'Hi' to the boys for me.''</p>
        <p>Timely House Special</p>
        <p>New York-based hockey buffs know that the year 1940 is a taunt sung as ''NINE-teen FOR-ty'' to Ranger supporters by their counterparts from Long Island.</p>
        <p>The taunt is meant to remind the Manhattan fans that the Rangers last won the Stanley Cup that year, and that the Islanders have won the trophy four times, in 1980-83.</p>
        <p>That memory is not as vivid for Neil Smith, the first-year general manager of the Rangers, who spent most of his league career in the Detroit Red Wings organization.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit to Detroit, Smith took his staff out to dinner.</p>
        <p>''We took a limo and everything,'' Smith recalled. When he returned to the hotel, he was asked by Howie Rose, a radio announcer, where Smith and his staff had dined.</p>
        <p>''The 1940 Chop House,'' Smith replied. At this point, Rose informed Smith of the coincidence.</p>
        <p>''Isn't that perfect?'' Smith said. ''It just goes to show you how little that bothers us. The perfect place for an anniversary dinner.''  NOTEBOOK</p>
