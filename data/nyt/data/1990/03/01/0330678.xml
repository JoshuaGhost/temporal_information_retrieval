        <p>LEAD: ESPN Inc. and the National Football League agreed yesterday on a new four-year contract that people close to the deal said would more than double the money that the N.F.L. now receives for broadcasts on sports cable television network.</p>
        <p>ESPN Inc. and the National Football League agreed yesterday on a new four-year contract that people close to the deal said would more than double the money that the N.F.L. now receives for broadcasts on sports cable television network.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which will bring the league $450 million, is similar to the accord reached last week by the Turner Broadcasting System, which will have cable television rights for the first half of the next four seasons.</p>
        <p>It gives ESPN the rights to 37 regular-season games in the second half of the 1990 to 1993 seasons, 8 next season and 9 in each of the remainder. The network will televise three exhibitions a year and the Pro Bowl.</p>
        <p>Most of the telecasts will be shown on Sunday nights, with the number increasing to 9 when the N.F.L. expands to 16 games in 18 weeks in 1991, when each team will get two off weeks. Next year, the schedule will be increased to 17 weeks, with each team getting a week off.</p>
        <p>First Cable Outlet</p>
        <p>Three years ago, ESPN became the N.F.L.'s first cable outlet, televising eight Sunday night games in the second half of each season. It paid about $50 million a year for the rights.</p>
        <p>The new contract averages out to $112.5 million a year, and with the Turner contract it gives the N.F.L. close to $1 billion in revenues even before the contracts with the over-the-air networks are agreed upon.</p>
        <p>Under the current contracts, each N.F.L. team receives net proceeds of about $17 million a year in television money.</p>
        <p>While the new Turner agreement takes eight games a season away from the primary networks, the trend in cable contracts indicates that the amount could increase to at least $30 million a team when all the revenues are totaled.</p>
        <p>The last time the television contracts were renewed, the money stayed about the same: the 1982 contract was for $2.1 billion over five years; the 1987 contract for $1.428 billion over three. Television revenues then were down and Pete Rozelle, who was then the N.F.L. commissioner, limited the length so that the contracts could be reopened at a more opportune time.</p>
