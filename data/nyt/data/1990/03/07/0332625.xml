        <p>LEAD: The bullets that wounded two detectives during an undercover drug deal in Manhattan on Monday came from their own guns or the gun of a third officer, high-ranking police officials said privately yesterday.</p>
        <p>The bullets that wounded two detectives during an undercover drug deal in Manhattan on Monday came from their own guns or the gun of a third officer, high-ranking police officials said privately yesterday.</p>
        <p>A state police investigator working with the detectives was killed in the same shootout, but a department spokesman said it was unclear who had fired the fatal shot, which caught the investigator in the eye as he was coming to the rescue of a detective who was being robbed. Because the slug was not found, it may remain a mystery, the spokesman, Inspector Richard Mayronne, said.</p>
        <p>Officially, the Police Department declined to say how many shots were fired, who fired the first one, or to provide a complete account of who shot whom.</p>
        <p>But the high-ranking officials said privately that the three officers had fired a total of 12 shots, while the suspects fired only one.</p>
        <p>Investigator Shot Detective</p>
        <p>In a public statement released yesterday evening, the Police Department said that it had established that one of the detectives, Craig Moruzzi, 41 years old, shot one of the suspects, David Hernandez, 20, twice as Mr. Hernandez fled with a .357 Magnum revolver in his hand. Ballistics tests also showed that the slain state police investigator, Joseph T. Aversa, 31, fired two shots before he was hit. One of those shots tore through Detective Moruzzi's thigh.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Inspector Mayronne said investigators knew little because the two wounded detectives, who are still in the hospital, had not been interviewed. It was still unclear, he said, who fired the shot that wounded the second detective, Joseph Mendez, 29, in the left thigh or who shot the second suspect, Oswaldo Santana, 26, in the left foot.</p>
        <p>But investigators who asked not to be identified said Mr. Santana was unarmed and Mr. Hernandez fired only one shot during the chaotic gun battle in a courtyard of the Jacob Riis Houses near East 6th Street and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive at 3:30 P.M. Monday.</p>
        <p>A third suspect, who was apparently not present at the shootout, was arrested late yesterday in connection with the drug deal.</p>
        <p>The detectives and the state trooper were members of a Federal Drug Enforcement Administration task force composed of Federal, state and city officers. Working undercover, they had been investigating Mr. Santana and a Dominican drug dealing ring for two weeks, said a D.E.A. spokeswoman, Mary Irene Cooper.</p>
        <p>The shooting broke out after Mr. Santana and Mr. Hernandez tried to rob Detective Mendez, who had arranged with Mr. Santana and a third man to buy two kilograms of cocaine for $42,000 in cash, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the two would-be robbers did not know they were dealing with police officers. It is not uncommon for low-level dealers to rob prospective buyers if they do not fear retribution.</p>
        <p>With Investigator Aversa and Detective Moruzzi posted nearby, investigators said, Detective Mendez drove to the back entrance of 174 Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive in a Pontiac Firebird and met Mr. Santana.</p>
        <p>A Glimpse of the Cash</p>
        <p>After opening the trunk of the car and letting Mr. Santana glimpse the cash, Detective Mendez followed him into a back door to the 13-story red-brick building. The door led to a set of stairs blocked off by workmen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hernandez was waiting there with a gun. He put it to Detective Mendez's head as Mr. Santana leapt on his back and bit him on the scalp. Detective Mendez, struggling, pulled his .38-caliber revolver and fired four shots, one of which seems to have gone through his own left thigh and struck Mr. Santana's foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hernandez, still holding his gun, bolted out the door and into the courtyard as the two backup officers ran in. Detective Moruzzi, who had heard the shots, fired at least six rounds from his Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, hitting Mr. Hernandez in the stomach and left elbow.</p>
        <p>Investigator Aversa fired two rounds from his .357 Magnum, one of which hit Detective Moruzzi. Then he was hit himself and fell just outside the door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hernandez dropped his weapon, jumped a small fence and then collapsed.</p>
        <p>Detective Mendez stumbled from the building and collapsed near the fence. A few minutes later, Mr. Santana was found by other officers cowering inside the blocked stairwell.</p>
        <p>Late yesterday evening, Federal authorities said they had arrested Juan Jose Peralta, of 384 East 10th Street on the Lower East Side at a house in Queens and charged him with conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooper, the D.E.A. spokeswoman, said Mr. Peralta is believed to have arranged the meeting between Detective Mendez and Mr. Santana, but was not present during the shootout.</p>
