        <p>LEAD: A two-part financing by the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, totaling $1.4 billion and consisting of an equal amount of five-year and 10-year debentures, was priced at par yesterday through various securities dealers.</p>
        <p>A two-part financing by the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, totaling $1.4 billion and consisting of an equal amount of five-year and 10-year debentures, was priced at par yesterday through various securities dealers.</p>
        <p>The five-year debentures due March 10, 1995, were given an 8.85 percent coupon and priced to yield about 27 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.</p>
        <p>Fannie Mae said the 10-year debentures due March 10, 2000, were different from the five-year issue, in that the debentures were callable at its option in whole or in part on March 10, 1993 and from time to time thereafter.</p>
        <p>Determing the price at redemption would be based on a formula tied to the principal amount redeemed and the coupon rate on the issue, said Fannie Mae, with the initial redemption price at 104.65.</p>
        <p>The 10-year debentures were priced to yield about 68.5 basis points more than Treasuries.</p>
