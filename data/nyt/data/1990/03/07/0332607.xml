        <p>LEAD: The father of a 5-year-old Bronx boy was charged with murder yesterday, a day after the badly bruised child died in a hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The father of a 5-year-old Bronx boy was charged with murder yesterday, a day after the badly bruised child died in a hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>Initially, the boy's father, Rufus Chisolm, 26, of 1153 East 229th Street in the Williamsbridge section, was charged with first-degree assault, Officer Frederick Weiner, a police spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>But late yesterday afternoon, the charge was upgraded to second-degree murder. Officer Weiner would not say what prompted the change.</p>
        <p>The police had questioned the boy's parents, siblings and neighbors trying to unravel Adam Mann's death.</p>
        <p>Adam, who had many bruises on his back and chest, was semiconsicous when a neighbor took him to Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center on Monday. The police said Monday that his mother had dropped him off at his grandmother's house, saying he was not well.</p>
        <p>Siblings in City Custody</p>
        <p>The boy's two sisters and two brothers are in the custody of the Bureau of Child Welfare, the police said. The five children had been living with their mother, Michele Mann, at 4030 Laconia Avenue in the Williamsbridge section.</p>
        <p>Three neighbors said yesterday that they were surprised, and had seen no signs of abuse or ill treatement.</p>
        <p>Darnley Forde, a retired truck driver who lives upstairs from the Manns, said yesterday that it was Mr. Chisolm, not Ms. Mann, who asked a friend to take Adam to the hospital.</p>
