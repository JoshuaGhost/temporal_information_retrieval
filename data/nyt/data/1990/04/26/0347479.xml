        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the city would move to break down bureaucratic barriers and provide social services to people where they live, rather than have them go to different offices in different areas.</p>
        <p>He promised to work to bring about a ''revolution in the culture of government'' by removing the desire of agencies to ''protect their turf and their traditional ways of doing business.''</p>
        <p>''We have a long way to go, but I see a day when social services in this city are dispensed from comprehensive, convenient neighborhood multi-service centers, locally based and responsive to local residents and their needs,'' the Mayor said in an address to the annual meeting of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, held at the Hotel Pierre.</p>
        <p>Under the concept of community-based services, people would be able to go to centers in their community for whatever social services they required, he said.</p>
        <p>The current system of serving families is so fragmented, critics say, that families seeking various types of help sometimes have to go to as many as six offices in six locations.</p>
