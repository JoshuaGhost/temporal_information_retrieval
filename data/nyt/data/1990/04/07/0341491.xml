        <p>LEAD: Afghan rebels turned a reconciliation ceremony into a deadly ambush today, killing at least 10 people, including 2 generals, and wounding many other Government officials, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Afghan rebels turned a reconciliation ceremony into a deadly ambush today, killing at least 10 people, including 2 generals, and wounding many other Government officials, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Eastern European diplomats and foreign journalists dived for cover as a group of rebels suddenly opened fire with automatic weapons at the ceremony in northwestern Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>About 10,000 people who had gathered for the event in a valley about 30 miles east of Herat scattered to escape the gun battle, which lasted more than 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Foreign Ministry officials at the scene said that Gen. Jalal Razmanda, the Deputy Security Minister, was killed and that the Governor of Herat Province, Fazle Haq Kaliq Yar, was wounded. A second general died as he was flown back to Kabul, the capital, with the journalists.</p>
        <p>Children Among the Victims</p>
        <p>Witnesses said at least 10 people died at the scene, some of them children. They said more than 50 people were wounded in the battle, which was fought with pistols, assault guns and machine guns fired by two Government tanks.</p>
        <p>The first shots were fired as Governor Kaliq Yar embraced one of the guerrilla commanders. When a handful of gunmen standing behind the commander shot the Governor, the whole area erupted in crossfire.</p>
        <p>Foreigners who attended the ceremony appeared to have escaped injury, although they were only a few yards from the battle. An Afghan television cameraman was wounded in the head.</p>
        <p>The Government-run Kabul radio blamed a ''small terrorist group'' for the shooting. It acknowledged that several top officials had been wounded but provided no other details.</p>
        <p>The ceremony had been intended as a formal demonstration of President Najibullah's policy of national reconciliation, under which his Soviet-backed Government has persuaded many rebels to lay down their arms. Foreign journalists and diplomats were flown 400 miles across the country from Kabul to watch the ceremony.</p>
        <p>A Blow to the President</p>
        <p>The violence will be a blow to Mr. Najibullah, who narrowly survived last month when air force officers attempting a coup bombed his Kabul palace.</p>
        <p>The coup attempt, led by Defense Minister Shahnawaz Tanai, failed, but many officers of his Khalq faction in the governing party remain in senior military positions.</p>
        <p>General Razmanda, whose Security Ministry oversees the country's hated security police, was a leading negotiator with rebel groups that had indicated they were open to discussions.</p>
        <p>Guerrilla leaders in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar have refused to hold talks with President Najibullah. But they have been unable to prevent some of their field commanders from reaching their own accords with the Government.</p>
        <p>The reconciliation policy is part of a wider effort by Mr. Najibullah to seek public support for his Government since the last of Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in February 1989.</p>
