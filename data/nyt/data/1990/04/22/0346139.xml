        <p>Completing a trade with the San Diego Chargers made two days earlier, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed the running back Gary Anderson to a four-year, $3.6 million contract yesterday.</p>
        <p>Anderson, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 1988 but sat out last season in a contract dispute, was acquired Thursday in a deal contingent on Anderson's agreeing to terms with Tampa Bay by noon in Tampa yesterday. The Chargers will receive a third-round draft pick this year and a second- or third-round pick next year.</p>
        <p>''I'm just glad this is behind me,'' said Anderson, who is 29 years old and has made his home in Tampa since his playing days with the Bandits of the now-defunct United States Football League.</p>
        <p>Last year, Anderson rejected a contract offer from San Diego worth $512,000 a season. He received a $400,000 signing bonus from Tampa Bay and will receive a salary of $600,000 this year.(AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
