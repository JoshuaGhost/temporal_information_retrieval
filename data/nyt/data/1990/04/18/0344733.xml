        <p>LEAD: Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts announced today that he would seek re-election even though the House ethics committee has yet to release a report on questions surrounding his relationship with a male prostitute.</p>
        <p>Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts announced today that he would seek re-election even though the House ethics committee has yet to release a report on questions surrounding his relationship with a male prostitute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, a 50-year-old liberal Democrat who is serving his fifth term in Congress, had said he would decide about seeking re-election after the report was released. But in a statement released by his office, he said the political calendar had pushed him to make an earlier decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, who in 1987 became the first member of Congress to disclose that he is a homosexual, noted that the report was not yet available and that the deadline for nominating petitions was May 8.</p>
        <p>No other Democrat has announced for the seat. The Republicans have fielded two little-known candidates.</p>
        <p>The Washington Times first reported Mr. Frank's relationship with a male prostitute last August, and published allegations that he was aware that a prostitution ring was being run out of his Capitol Hill apartment.</p>
        <p>He apologized for ''poor judgment'' in hiring the prostitute but denied knowing about the prostitution ring.</p>
        <p>The ethics panel plans to meet Thursday in a closed session, but a committee spokeswoman gave no indication whether the Congressman's case would be on the agenda.</p>
