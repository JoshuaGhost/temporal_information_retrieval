        <p>LEAD: An explosion, possibly caused by a pipe bomb, injured at least three people early this morning at a bar in Greenwich Village, the police said.</p>
        <p>An explosion, possibly caused by a pipe bomb, injured at least three people early this morning at a bar in Greenwich Village, the police said.</p>
        <p>The blast occurred about 12:10 A.M. at Uncle Charlie's Downtown Bar at 56 Greenwich Avenue, said a police spokeswoman, Sergeant Tina S. Mohrmann. She described damage to the building as ''minor.''</p>
        <p>Three men were taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition and expected to be released shortly, said a hospital spokesperson, Dina Gabriel.</p>
        <p>The bomb squad was investigating, and initial reports indicated a pipe bomb may have caused the damage, Sergeant Mohrmann said.</p>
        <p>One patron at the nightspot, Frizzell Green, said he was standing at the bar when the blast went off in a trash can five to six feet from him, producing a cloud of smoke and sending debris in all directions. ''It was like a loud firecracker,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A bartender, who would not give his name, said he saw a pipe in the trash can after the explosion.</p>
