        <p>Pity the performer. No amount of planning, rehearsal or mental preparation can insure a musician against intrusions from the natural or urban environment or from the audience: the rare earthquake, the occasional siren outside the hall or the commonplace crinkle of candy wrappers.</p>
        <p>Take the cough - please. Some fine, considered performances have been damaged by coughers. A recent piano recital by Misha Dichter at Carnegie Hall, for example, was marred when a cougher disrupted a particularly absorbing account of Schubert's great Sonata in B flat (D. 960) precisely at the work's most sublime moment. Late in the second movement, after a murky passage in C sharp minor, a delicate, pristine C-major chord comes from some ethereal realm to transform the mood. On this occasion, a virtuoso consumptive seized the moment, injecting a note of harsh reality and carrying the mood to an altogether more desolate plane.</p>
        <p>The film critic Gene Shalit once wrote of coughing: ''What can be the cause of this at concerts? I work with literally hundreds of people every day, and I never hear anybody cough. Never. What is there about a concert hall that causes people to disrupt the music? Perhaps P. D. Q. Bach should let audiences know what they sound like by composing a Concerto for Catarrh.''</p>
        <p>While awaiting such a work, performers have sometimes taken matters into their own hands. The guitarist Andres Segovia would sometimes frown over his glasses or cover his mouth with his handkerchief and cough soundlessly into it as a hint.</p>
        <p>The jazz pianist Keith Jarrett stopped a performance in Montreal during an early flurry of coughing. ''O.K., everybody cough,'' he said, and briefly left the stage. Evidently even that did not clear the air. Mr. Jarrett stopped again 15 minutes later to discuss the matter at greater length.</p>
        <p>Once, in New Jersey, Mr. Dichter halted a performance of Brahms's ''Handel Variations'' in the middle of the first variation, at the noise of a candy wrapper. ''That's a sound like fingernails on a chalkboard for me,'' he said the other day. ''Before I realized what was happening, I just stopped cold, looked at the audience and said, 'Will the person slowly unwrapping that candy stop immediately?' I couldn't even believe I had stopped; it was an involuntary response.'' Then, ''trembling with rage,'' he said, he returned to the beginning of the variation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dichter said he generally does not become as angry about coughing as he does about candy wrappers and beeping electronic watches, since the cough has at least some physiological basis. In the case of the ill-fated Schubert slow movement, however, he was furious.</p>
        <p>''Your first response,'' he said, ''is just to throw your hands up in the air and say: 'Never mind. Let's go to the next movement.' The implications of that moment are so enormous. As all those things you're hearing fade away, you're thinking about the new harmony. You're waiting for a slight moment of silence and putting all of your energy into the quietest possible C major, hoping that it's just right. And then a cough at that moment: It's over.''</p>
        <p>No one, of course, least of all the performer, wants any listener to suffer unduly during a concert by stifling a seriously needed cough. As Mr. Shalit suggested, however, suffering seldom seems the issue. With rare exceptions, anyone too sick to sit quietly through a performance should probably not be there in the first place. (The pianist Krystian Zimerman, though reportedly suffering from the flu during his strenuous recent Carnegie Hall recital, needed to cough only once, between movements of a Brahms sonata.) Rather than acute physical discomfort, the continual, seemingly random coughs bespeak, at best, inattention; at worst, boredom or even discontentment - none of which is calculated to inspire a performer's best efforts.</p>
        <p>Even at that, coughs are perhaps less annoying these days than electronic beeps, which go off idiotically somewhere in the hall at least on the hour (more or less). For the performer as well as the listener, these sounds are often doubly distracting, since they not only intrude upon the performance, but also - as discrete pitches - carry false musical (or rather, soulless, antimusical) cues. A single peep during an overtone-rich performance on a harpsichord is enough to keep one's ear atwitch for the duration.</p>
        <p>Nor is the damage always so subtle. In its uncannily precise timing, Mr. Dichter's mishap in the Schubert reminded one of a recital by the pianist Jeffrey Siegel at the 92d Street Y in 1981. The program's main attraction was the first New York performance of an early version of Schumann's Fantasy in C (Op. 17), which differs from the familiar version mainly in its ending.</p>
        <p>Separated from his dear Clara by her father at the time of composition, Schumann sent her a touching message by quoting Beethoven's song cycle ''An die Ferne Geliebte'' (''To the Distant Beloved'') at the end of the first movement. In the early version he brought the tune back at the close of the finale as well, ending the work with exquisite hushed song instead of the later rattling arpeggios. On this occasion, just as Mr. Siegel approached that melody at the end of a compelling performance, an electronic beeper blared loudly, utterly destroying the mood.</p>
        <p>When asked recently whether he remembered the incident, Mr. Siegel said: ''I'm afraid I do. It happened in the moment of silence just before the return; I hate to call it a pregnant silence, but it is, really, and you don't want it taken away. When it happens, you just try to regroup as best you can and recapture the mood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel said he tries to remain stoical in the face of what he calls the intrusions of modern life on the concert experience. The root of the problem, he feels, is that people are simply too accustomed to hearing music everywhere as background and going about their business. ''The Schumann Fantasy,'' he said, ''is no longer the privilege of the concert hall.''</p>
        <p>So again, it comes down to inattention. Clearly, the times call for desperate measures to convince audiences that attention must be paid. Where is that proto-shock-therapist P. D. Q. Bach now that we need him?</p>
        <p>When approached with Mr. Shalit's suggestion, the composer's posthumous amanuensis, Peter Schickele, said he would ''file it away in the back of what I laughingly call my mind.'' With typical perversity, however, Mr. Schickele went on to cite a performance of his that actually benefited from unplanned intrusions.</p>
        <p>At a P. D. Q. Bach concert in a chapel at the University of Chicago, he said, ''I went into the part of the history where I say that P. D. Q. Bach did meet Mozart, although the meeting was not quite as interesting as one would have hoped because Mozart was only 3 days old at the time, and a baby cried at exactly that moment. That was the same concert at which I said that unfortunately I hadn't been able to discover any of the religious pieces that I knew P. D. Q. Bach had composed, and all of a sudden there was a huge clap of thunder. It was perfect.''</p>
