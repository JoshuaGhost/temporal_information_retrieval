        <p>LEAD: According to Congress's investigating agency, employers subject to sanctions for hiring undocumented aliens under a 1986 law have engaged in a ''widespread pattern of discrimination'' against people who look and sound foreign. That finding has led critics of sanctions to demand their repeal.</p>
        <p>According to Congress's investigating agency, employers subject to sanctions for hiring undocumented aliens under a 1986 law have engaged in a ''widespread pattern of discrimination'' against people who look and sound foreign. That finding has led critics of sanctions to demand their repeal.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act has caused increased discrimination by employers and the General Accounting Office is right to urge corrective measures. But there are less drastic remedies than repealing the sanctions.</p>
        <p>The most obvious remedy is better education for employers. What does the 1986 law require of them? Only to ask that all new hires are authorized to work in the U.S. Applicants may use any of 17 documents, like a Social Security card, to establish work eligibility. Once employers examine the documents and satisfy themselves that they are not fraudulent, they submit a simple verification form to Immigration and the Department of Labor.</p>
        <p>It's not a complicated procedure. In fact, about 80 percent of employers seem to be complying with the law. But even the G.A.O. thinks the Federal Government could do a better job of educating employers on the requirements of the law. A broad public education campaign ought to be a top priority.</p>
        <p>Another remedy, as the G.A.O. suggests, is to reduce the number of acceptable work authorization documents. A counterfeit-resistant Social Security card is being phased into use and Immigration plans to reduce its work eligibility documents from 10 to 2. These changes seem to make sense.</p>
        <p>Pending stepped-up education efforts and simplified verification procedures, more drastic remedies would be hasty. One is a national voluntary work authorization card, which is more secure but has worrisome privacy implications.</p>
        <p>Similarly, calls for repeal of employer sanctions seem premature. Although the G.A.O. found increased hiring discrimination as a result of the 1986 law, it also thinks sanctions against offending employers have reduced illegal immigration. The increased difficulty of finding work in the U.S. has apparently discouraged some aliens from crossing the border illegally.</p>
        <p>That's what the law intended. What the law did not intend is increased discrimination, and Congress and the Bush Administration ought to redouble their efforts against it. The law needs to be better carried out, not invalidated.</p>
