        <p>He was a star basketball player and an acclaimed television sports executive, but things have changed for Chet Forte. The former high-scoring guard and playmaker for Columbia, who went on to receive nine Emmy Awards as a producer-director during his 25-year career with ABC, is now broke. He is also suffering from cancer and facing a series of Federal fraud and tax charges carrying penalties upon conviction of more than 70 years in prison and millions in fines.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the 54-year-old Forte is charged with fraudulently obtaining $1.47 million in bank loans by overstating his net worth on applications.</p>
        <p>At an initial hearing in Newark on Friday, Larry Lustberg, an assistant public defender, told the court that Forte was an unemployed compulsive gambler who had lost millions of dollars at Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City casinos and was now being supported by his wife's family.</p>
        <p>Forte, whose television credits include ''Monday Night Football'' and the 1968 and 1984 Summer Olympics, left ABC in 1987 to become an independent producer and director. He was an all-American at Columbia in 1957.</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Forte was released on his own recognizance and told to find someone to post $500,000 bond for him by Tuesday. No arraignment date was set.(AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
