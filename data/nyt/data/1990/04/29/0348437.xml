        <p>LEAD: Thursday is the 150th anniversary of the first postage stamp, the British Penny Black. For collectors of the popular topic ''stamps on stamps,'' the sesquicentennial is becoming something of a philatelic frenzy.</p>
        <p>Thursday is the 150th anniversary of the first postage stamp, the British Penny Black. For collectors of the popular topic ''stamps on stamps,'' the sesquicentennial is becoming something of a philatelic frenzy.</p>
        <p>Central to the celebration is a 10-day exposition somewhat immodestly called Stamp World London 90 - The World's Greatest Stamp Exhibition. More than 500 exhibits are planned for the show, which opens Thursday at the Alexandra Palace in London. Stamps and postal history will be offered for sale by 160 dealers and 130 postal administrations.</p>
        <p>Of special interest is a marquee set up with exhibits for children. Many older stamp collectors fear the hobby is dying because more young people are succumbing to the distractions of television, organized sports and (gasp!) baseball-card collecting. This effort by Stamp World London is aimed at reversing that trend.</p>
        <p>Long after the show has closed, collectors will be chasing the dozens of stamps that are being issued to commemorate the May 3, 1840 release of the Penny Black, which has a profile of Queen Victoria surrounded by scrollwork and the words ''Postage'' at the top and ''One Penny'' at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The portrait is based on a medal struck for the visit by the Queen to the Guildhall in the City of London during her coronation celebration. The stamp was designed by Rowland Hill, an education reformer who was instrumental in developing the penny post to replace the scandal-ridden system that preceded it.</p>
        <p>The medal was designed by William Wyon, a fourth-generation artist whose grandfather, four uncles and numerous cousins dominated the art in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
        <p>Before the introduction of the uniform penny post, the treasury was losing great sums of money because of postal frauds made easier by the use of manuscript markings and handstamps to show postage paid. Hill persuaded the Government that the letter rate could be standardized at a penny, about a quarter of previous rates, and that the greater security would actually lead to an increase in revenues. He was right.</p>
        <p>The stamp-on-stamp issues for the anniversary are led by a British souvenir sheet showing a copy of the Penny Black next to a current 20-pence stamp, a Two Reigns definitive that shows the profile of Queen Elizabeth II and, in ancestral shadow, the profile of Queen Victoria. Britannia rides triumphant on the right margin, a design taken from Britain's 1913 classic seahorses issue.</p>
        <p>The next largest block of issues will come from 17 postal administrations whose marketing is handled by the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation (480 West 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10001). One of the more notable issues offered by the company is that of Sierra Leone, which closely mimics the Penny Black, even to the lack of a country name. Under the regulations of the Universal Postal Union, only Britain, the first stamp issuer, is allowed to issue stamps without a country name.</p>
        <p>Collectors interested in ''stamps on stamps'' should also write to the American Topical Association (Box 630, Johnstown, Pa. 15907), through which like-minded hobbyists and dealers can be contacted.</p>
        <p>Collectors interested primarily in British stamps should write to the British Philatelic Bureau (20 Brandon Street, Edinburgh, Scotland EH3 5TT), which will supply a price list of recent issues. The bureau also publishes a classy, small-format monthly with a wealth of information about the design and history of British stamps and runs the Stamp Bug Club for younger collectors.</p>
        <p>Any hobbyist who gets to London for the birthday party should visit the National Postal Museum (King Edward Building, King Edward Street, London EC1A 1LP) and the Post Office Archives (Freeling House, 23 Glasshill Street, London SE1 0BQ). Both have extensive specialized exhibits and gift shops; catalogues are available by mail.</p>
        <p>Back to School</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania State University is offering four non-credit courses in stamp collecting and one in printing methods. Course materials are available from the Department of Independent Learning, University Park, Pa. 16802. Interested hobbyists can get more information by telephone. The toll-free number is (800) 252-3592, except in Pennsylvania, where the number is (800) 458-3617.</p>
