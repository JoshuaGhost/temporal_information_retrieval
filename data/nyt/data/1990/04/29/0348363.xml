        <p>LEAD: This was the week of the Swiss franc as it moved higher against the dollar, the West German mark and the yen. A week ago, it took 1.4900 francs to buy a dollar. By last Friday, it took only 1.4530.

        <p>This was the week of the Swiss franc as it moved higher against the dollar, the West German mark and the yen. A week ago, it took 1.4900 francs to buy a dollar. By last Friday, it took only 1.4530. The franc has been helped by the country's relatively high interest rates and by comments at week's end by the head of Switzerland's central bank supporting a strong currency and a sustained fight against inflation. In the foreign exchange market, that means interest rates will be pushed higher if necessary. Meanwhile, the pound ran into some trouble in the middle of the week as the British trade deficit jumped in March to $:2.18 billion, from $:1.39 billion in February. The yen stayed below 160 to the dollar for another week, a success of sorts for the beleaguered Japanese currency.</p>
