        <p>IN Judith Sacks's living room, curtains never have to be sent to the dry cleaners because they are made of wood. In the kitchen, dishes never have to be dried because they can drip dry through a wooden rack directly into the sink. These design solutions are as functional as they are imaginative.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sacks, a 47-year-old industrial designer who has designed luggage, wooden boxes and stoneware dishes for Gear and glasses for Marimekko, has secretly yearned to be an architect. Two years ago, when she and her husband, Michael, a psychiatrist, began renovating their two-bedroom apartment, which they share with their 9-year-old son, Timothy, she decided to treat the apartment as ''a product to design.''</p>
        <p>The hand-painted wooden curtains frame the windows in the living room of their Upper West Side apartment.</p>
        <p>The curtain around the larger window, which overlooks the street, has a grassy green background with dusty pink flowers and hints of yellow. The curtain has been painted to look as if it has folds. The curtain over the second window, which has a view of a garden, is a deeper shade of green.</p>
        <p>To make the curtains, Ms. Sacks draped paper around the window, cut out a pattern and transferred it onto birch plywood, which she cut with a handsaw. She then commissioned two Manhattan painters, Eva Mizrakian and Mark Maillaro, to execute her design. They applied varnish between each layer of paint. ''You can remove what you don't like,'' Ms. Sacks said.</p>
        <p>To maximize the amount of light coming through the windows, she designed the curtains to extend 10 inches from the wall. They are supported by rectangular pieces of wood. ''Light comes into the room from the sides and the top,'' said Ms. Sacks, who got the idea for the curtains from a photograph of a room that the artist David Hockney designed for a show house in 1988.</p>
        <p>In February, she built a birch plywood table that is 9 feet 2 inches long and 3 feet 3 inches wide. She made the wooden legs look like twigs by adding papier-mache. She attached a strip of Masonite, a composite of wood chips, to the sides of the table, then cut scalloped edges with a handsaw and decorated the sides with delicate papier-mache lilies. The result is a ''tablecloth'' as permanent as the curtains.  Last summer, she took a course in papier-mache from Susan Baker, an artist in Truro, Mass., where the Sackses have a summer home. ''I was the only person in the class over 9 years old,'' Ms. Sacks said.</p>
        <p>Just as she adapted her wooden curtains from an idea of David Hockney's, she drew inspiration for her dish racks from Sam Clark, the author of ''The Motion-Minded Kitchen'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1983). ''In his book, he wrote about a system where dishes can just drain into the sink,'' Ms. Sacks said. Glasses are placed upside down, while plates stand up. The bottom shelf, which holds coffee funnels and knives, tilts forward, and has a channel that spills the water into the sink.</p>
        <p>In the bathroom, towels hang on 10 hooks. ''I live with two men who never hang up towels,'' Ms. Sacks said. To prevent people from looking into the bathroom window but also to let in light, she drew a pattern of branches on white drafting paper and glued the design onto the window.</p>
        <p>The ideas for Ms. Sacks's humorous but practical designs for her home did not come overnight. ''I like to live in a place for a while before I work out the solution,'' she said. ''I want to make sure the ideas work.''</p>
