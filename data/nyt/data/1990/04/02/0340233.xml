        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Gorbachev Plan for Family Farms Is Approved by Soviet Lawmakers'' (news article, March 1), you report that there is ''popular hesitancy'' about the plan. You state that only 12 percent of 2,600 Soviet respondents said they might try to lease a tract of land under the plan. The poll of 1,774 urban and 823 rural residents, as reported in Izvestia, actually leads one to a very different conclusion.</p>
        <p>Only 10 to 12 percent of the respondents who were familiar with the draft law disapproved of it completely. Between 85 percent and 87 percent of the respondents reacted favorably to land ownership by individuals, and of the rural sample, about 40 percent reported that they were prepared to undertake individual farming. Only 1 of 10 rural respondents flatly rejected individual farming.</p>
        <p>A second finding, equally significant but missing from your report, was the extent of regional variation on the most desirable form of individual farming. Respondents in Latvia want private land, with the right to sell as well as inherit, whereas in Central Asia the respondents favor long-term leases from the state. In the Russian Republic, on the other hand, respondents prefer lifetime leases with the right to inherit.</p>
        <p>The results of the poll demonstrate that despite decades of Soviet rule, popular attitudes toward individual ownership of land have not changed that much over time, certainly not to the extent that is suggested in your article.</p>
