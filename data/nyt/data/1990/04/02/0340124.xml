        <p>LEAD: The Honduran military began a nationwide search today for the gunmen who wounded eight United States airmen over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The Honduran military began a nationwide search today for the gunmen who wounded eight United States airmen over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The servicemen were wounded Saturday when three snipers fired automatic weapons at a bus carrying 28 American airmen along a mountain road near the capital. A leftist insurgent group claimed responsibility.</p>
        <p>President Rafael Leonardo Callejas sent the American Ambassador, Cresencio Arcos, a message today denouncing the attack, said a spokesman for the United States Embassy, Terrence Kneebone. Gen. Arnulfo Cantero Lopez, the Honduran armed forces chief, said a nationwide hunt for the attackers was under way.</p>
        <p>The Southern Command headquarters in Quarry Heights, Panama, said two of the airmen were in critical but stable condition at the Medical School Hospital in Tegucigalpa.</p>
        <p>An airman who suffered chest wounds was in stable condition and three others were being treated for leg wounds at the command's Gorgas Hospital. Two were treated for minor wounds at the Soto Cano air base.</p>
        <p>The statement said the eight had been on temporary duty at Jamastran, a town in southern Honduras.</p>
        <p>An anonymous caller to the private network Radio America claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the Morazanista National Liberation Front. In July, the front took responsibility for an attack in which seven American servicemen were hurt.</p>
