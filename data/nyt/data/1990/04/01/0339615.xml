        <p>Perhaps all too soon for some in this besmirched baseball season, George Steinbrenner is again in a legal rhubarb. The Yankees' owner has admitted paying $40,000 to Howard Spira, a former radio reporter and self-described gambler, for giving him information in his dispute last year with the outfielder Dave Winfield over the player's foundation for children. Mr. Spira claimed that foundation funds were being misappropriated, among other assertions. When Mr. Spira requested more money, Mr. Steinbrenner called Federal authorities. Mr. Spira has been charged with extortion and threatening Mr. Steinbrenner and Mr. Winfield. An arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. The Yankees' owner has offered his own reasons for paying the money, saying he did it ''out of the goodness of my heart'' and to squelch embarrassing information about former Yankee employees. Some Yankee observers, aware of the owner's efforts to trade Mr. Winfield, believe that Mr. Steinbrenner wanted something negative to pressure Mr. Winfield into accepting a trade.</p>
