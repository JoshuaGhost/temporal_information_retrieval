        <p>After a five-month search for a house that meets the tastes of JOSEPH and LILY FERNANDEZ, New York's Schools Chancellor and his wife, a city fund plunked down nearly $1 million yesterday for a town house in Brooklyn Heights. A state agency acquired title to the house, which it is giving to the city, which is in turn transferring it to the Board of Education, which is how these things work in the metropolitan maze.</p>
        <p>The money, $995,000 to be precise, is coming from the New York City Educational Construction Fund, which finds developers willing to incorporate schools into housing and commercial space. The new house is just a five-block stroll to the Board of Education headquarters at 110 Livingston Street.</p>
