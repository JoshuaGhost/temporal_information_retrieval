        <p>The White Puma</p>
        <p>By R. D. Lawrence</p>
        <p>329 pages. Henry Holt. $19.95.</p>
        <p>An author who tells a story through the perspective of an animal adds to the normal difficulties of suspending disbelief for the reader. In the most famous animal story of all, ''The Call of the Wild,'' Jack London wrote about the education necessary for a domestic dog's survival in the ways of a wolf pack and, as he did in his other politically oriented novels, he delivered an underlying lesson of man's greed. In ''The Mirror Maker'' (Schocken Books, 1989), one of Primo Levi's perceptive books of essays, the Italian author said London had poured his own experiences in the Klondike into the life of Buck, the cunning dog, with unerring intuition.</p>
        <p>R. D. Lawrence, a Canadian biologist, gave himself an even more formidable task than London in his new novel, ''The White Puma.'' It is told through the perspective of a family of pumas trying to survive in the wilderness of British Columbia despite the intrusion of greedy poachers and wealthy hunters. The effort of a few conservationists to save these wild animals hovers in the background of the story. Mr. Lawrence brings all his knowledge as a naturalist into play in ''The White Puma,'' a beautifully written and rather remarkable animal novel.</p>
        <p>Only a brief explanatory note is offered by the author to prime the reader. The Incas called the big cats pumas while North Americans call them mountain lions or cougars. Although nowhere plentiful, the greatest number are now found only in western Canada, the western United States and some areas of South America. White pumas are extremely rare; the few that have been known to occur have been killed for their skins.</p>
        <p>With only occasional anthropomorphizing, Mr. Lawrence puts the reader into a puma's head, eyes, ears and nose as he is tracked by helicopters, snowmobiles, horses, trained dogs and hunters carrying rifles with electronic sights, as if they were an armed force trying to kill the enemy in some foreign land. The puma recognized the scent of the two particular hunters who had once almost caught him in a mountain cave. In fact, one of the men had accidentally lost half his arm to a trap he had set for the puma. This man now sought vengeance, just as a more familiar human in literature was once obsessed by a particular whale.</p>
        <p>''It was not in the nature of the puma to feel hatred, an emotion rarely experienced by any animal,'' the author writes. ''Had he lived in a region undisturbed by human activity, the puma would never have been given cause to experience hatred. In his world, he became aggressively aroused only when it was necessary to kill in order to eat, but he hunted dispassionately. Similarly, if challenged by a male of his own species, he fought; afterward he did not hold a grudge. But he now hated, because he had been deprived of his family by the humans he was watching. He had been goaded by these men and their dogs. As a result, like other powerful predators before him, he had become a man-hater; and because he was strong and lithe and superbly equipped for killing, he was dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Later, the reader follows a white puma and her family in the forests of the night as they go through their life cycles of courtship, mating, raising their young and hunting. Their daily activities are drawn so sympathetically and accurately that we empathize with them, even as they sink their claws into other handsome animals, like moose and deer, and gorge themselves. When the white puma herself is hunted by all the modern weaponry of mankind, the reader cheers against the two-footed predators - and hopes harm will befall the German businessman at the $5,000-a-week Canadian hunting lodge who offers $12,000 for the white puma's hide.</p>
        <p>Although filled with the lore of the wilderness, ''The White Puma'' is very much a novel. It has several surprising developments, particularly when two conservationists arrive on the scene as the hunters are closing in on the white puma. One is a biologist (perhaps the author's voice) and the second is described as a slim, tanned woman in her late 20's who is president of the Canadian Conservation Alliance in Vancouver.</p>
        <p>On her own, the heroine devises a way to throw the hunters off the white puma's track. Armed only with her camera, she finds herself alone, a few feet from the magnificent cat who hates men - and who has tracked her by the scent of her body and lipstick. Then: ''The woman and the puma appraised each other in peace and in companionable silence, the animal unmoving except for the slight tremors of his flanks that accompanied his breathing; the human, although relaxed, shivering from time to time, little tremors of body and hands that bespoke her excitement.''</p>
        <p>What happens next, and in the days that follow, causes some disbelief yet stretches the story acceptably because the reader has come to trust the author's knowledge. Not every novel has to be about the familiar perils of being 30-something in New York or Los Angeles. In ''The White Puma,'' Mr. Lawrence has created a different world, taken a big risk in his angle of narration and succeeded in producing a highly readable work of fiction. Holtzbrinckd(Holt)</p>
