        <p>LEAD: The pressure of winning his first senior event is off. His game is in tune. He designed the course, and his chief 50-and-over competitors have gone off their games.</p>
        <p>The pressure of winning his first senior event is off. His game is in tune. He designed the course, and his chief 50-and-over competitors have gone off their games.</p>
        <p>Basically, Jack Nicklaus began the PGA Seniors' Championship today as if it were a mismatch.</p>
        <p>On a windblown and water-hazard-fraught PGA National course on which no one else in the field could break 70, Nicklaus shot a four-under-par 68 for a three-shot head start toward his second straight Senior Tour victory.</p>
        <p>Trevino Shoots 77</p>
        <p>Nicklaus leads the foursome of Mike Hill, Dale Douglass, Al Kelley and Jim Ferree, all of whom shot one-under-par 71. He also placed some serious distance between himself and Lee Trevino, who soared to a five-under-par 77.</p>
        <p>''I told these other players, but they didn't believe me,'' said Trevino. ''I said: 'Y'all better look up those old newspaper clippings. This is Jack Nicklaus, not Jack Gump.' ''</p>
        <p>''I played very well,'' said a relaxed Nicklaus. ''I managed my game very well. I know when I play well, and I'm really very pleased.''</p>
        <p>He should be. He used the same power game that brought him victory in his Senior debut in the Tradition two weeks ago and that allowed him to contend at the Masters before finishing sixth.</p>
        <p>Bob Charles and Orville Moody, the two top money winners on last year's Senior Tour, shot 75 and 76, respectively. Trevino, who won three of the four Senior tournaments he played in before Nicklaus showed up, had 77. Arnold Palmer shot 80. 'Out of Their Comfort Zones'</p>
        <p>Gary Player, who shot 74, said, ''Some of these guys are out of their comfort zones now that Jack is out here.''</p>
        <p>Larry Mowry, the defending champion, who shot a four-over-par 76, said, ''I think some guys are trying a little harder than they have to, and I might be one of them.''</p>
        <p>So, it seems, is Trevino. Since shooting 12 straight rounds of par or better before Nicklaus arrived on the Senior Tour, Trevino has shot four straight rounds of par or worse. His pre-Nicklaus scoring average was 68.3. In four post-Nicklaus rounds, he is averaging 74.</p>
        <p>''I may have shot myself out of here,'' Trevino said today. ''It was really rough. I was as ready as I've ever been, but nothing went right.''</p>
        <p>Only Hill, who was three under par until he took a double-bogey 6 at the par-4 16th, professed immunity to the specter of Nicklaus.</p>
        <p>''I don't compete against Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino,'' said Hill, who is second to Trevino on the money list with $175,017 in winnings.</p>
        <p>''What these other fellows have done, and why some of them are not playing as well this year as they did last year, I don't know.''</p>
