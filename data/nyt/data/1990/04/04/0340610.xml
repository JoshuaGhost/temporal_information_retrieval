        <p>LEAD: Wine collectors from around the Western world spent more than $1 million on Monday bidding for 13,000 bottles of Crimean dessert and fortified wine produced from the 1830's to 1945 and never before available in the West.</p>
        <p>Wine collectors from around the Western world spent more than $1 million on Monday bidding for 13,000 bottles of Crimean dessert and fortified wine produced from the 1830's to 1945 and never before available in the West.</p>
        <p>The wines, from a collection held at Massandra, a winery on the Black Sea built for Czar Nicholas II, included 1,155 bottles from the czarist period, 62 of which bore the imperial seal, a twin-headed eagle cipher.</p>
        <p>The best of the collection was purchased by Terence Bryan, a 60-year-old London businessman, who said he was representing a Swiss-based businessman. Among the $100,000 worth of wine purchased by Mr. Bryan were five bottles of 1891 white port-style wine from the Czar's palace, Livadia, for $22,400.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryan also spent $10,150 for three bottles of an 1886 wine called Prince Golitzin the Honey of Altae Pastures, a sweet, deep, yellow-hued wine that is believed to have been served at Czar Nicholas II's coronation in 1894.</p>
        <p>Daniel and John Zivko, brothers from Cleveland who purchased about $87,000 worth of wine, said they intended to drink the wine they bought. Some of what they do not drink, said Daniel Zivko, 37, the owner of Wickliffe Industries, a plastics company, will be donated for a charity auction.</p>
        <p>The Zivkos bought 32 varieties of wine, including 1914 Massandra Malaga, described by Sotheby's wine expert, David Molyneux-Berry, as ''almost treacle-like on the palate''; 1931 Ai-Danil Tokay, a sweet wine that Mr. Molyneux-Berry said will ''keep for years,'' and 1937 Kuchuk Lambat Black Muscat, described as being ''very sweet and rich'' in taste.</p>
        <p>The Massandra wines were sold to raise hard currency for new wine-making equipment, Mr. Molyneux-Berry said. Their like will probably not be seen at auction again, he said, noting, ''There are very few old bottles left, but we may see some younger vintages possibly sold in the years to come.''</p>
        <p>For the Zivkos and others, the Sotheby's auction was as much about history as about wine.</p>
        <p>Before the reign of Nicholas II, Mr. Molyneux-Berry said, Crimeans made mostly sparkling wines and red and white table wines, but ''partially because of the Czar's sweet tooth,'' the late 19th-century winemakers in the Crimea began to specialize in sweet dessert and fortified wines.</p>
        <p>They were led by Prince Lev Golitzin, a Sorbonne-educated lawyer who came to the Crimea in the late 1870's and who found, after repeated attempts at producing fine table wines, that the Crimea, with its subtropical, arid climate, was best suited to the production of wines with high sugar levels. When the winery at Massandra was built in the 1890's, Prince Golitzin was appointed wine maker.</p>
        <p>Under his direction, the winery flourished, producing fortified wines modeled after European wines, which were served not only at the Czar's table, but at royal baptisms and coronations. And, along with new wines was born a wine-making dynasty that continues today.</p>
        <p>In 1898, one Aleksandr Yegorov joined Prince Golitzin at Massandra. He would survive the 1917 revolution and return to Massandra in 1936. His grandson, Yuri Yegorov, is now the chief wine maker for the Massandra Amalgamation, a group of wineries associated with Massandra.</p>
        <p>According to the Sotheby's catalogue, the Massandra Collection was formed sometime before Prince Golitzin's death in 1915. Although by January 1918, the Bolsheviks were largely in control, Massandra and the Crimea continued to be held by the White Russians.</p>
        <p>While the counterrevolution raged, the collection remained safely hidden in the winery's bricked-up tunnels. By the late 1920's, Massandra was again producing fine wines. Production was interrupted again in 1941 in World War II. By 1945, the collection had been restored and the winery was producing again. Today, Massandra is used only as a bulk and bottle-aging place for the best of the Crimean wines.</p>
