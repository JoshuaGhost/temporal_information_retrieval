        <p>LEAD: Putting their common interests ahead of competition, CBS, NBC, and ABC yesterday announced the formation of a new organization, the Network Television Association, to promote network television to advertisers and agencies.</p>
        <p>Putting their common interests ahead of competition, CBS, NBC, and ABC yesterday announced the formation of a new organization, the Network Television Association, to promote network television to advertisers and agencies.</p>
        <p>While broadcasters' interests have been represented by the Television Bureau of Advertising, the Network Television Association will be the first group to represent only the major networks, said Peter Chrisanthopoulos, the association's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The group's board of directors will consist of Mr. Chrisanthopoulos and three people from each network. Tom Leahy, the president of marketing for CBS, was named the first chairman of its executive committee. Mr. Chrisanthopoulos said that the Fox Broadcasting Company would be asked to join when it officially becomes a network.</p>
        <p>As the number of subscribers to cable television roughly tripled over the last decade, the networks saw their share of the prime time viewing audience plunge from 90 percent in 1979-80 to 66 percent this year, according to Nielsen Media Research. Advertising revenue has also been pinched; last year it fell two-tenths of a percent from 1988.</p>
