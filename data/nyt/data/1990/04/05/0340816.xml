        <p>LEAD: The Bank of New England Corporation announced a drastic plan yesterday to cut expenses and return to profitability by eliminating about a third of its payroll, The banking company, which had already begun to reduce its size by selling loans, said it planned to cut 5,600 jobs. About 1,700 workers would be notified within a few days, it said, and other jobs will be cut by the end of the year through attrition, sales of businesses and consolidations.</p>
        <p>The Bank of New England Corporation announced a drastic plan yesterday to cut expenses and return to profitability by eliminating about a third of its payroll, The banking company, which had already begun to reduce its size by selling loans, said it planned to cut 5,600 jobs. About 1,700 workers would be notified within a few days, it said, and other jobs will be cut by the end of the year through attrition, sales of businesses and consolidations.</p>
        <p>In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the one-time costs of the layoffs, plus additions to its reserves for loan losses, would probably result in a loss for the first quarter.</p>
        <p>After losing more than $1.1 billion in 1989, mostly as a result of bad real estate loans, the bank has been operating under strict agreements with Federal regulators. Because its financial difficulties have led some large depositors to withdraw funds, the Bank of New England has borrowed about $1.7 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Job cuts, continued asset sales and other measures to be announced next week are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by about $300 million when completed, the company said. Under the business plan developed by the new chairman, Lawrence Fish, the company plans to concentrate on its consumer business, trust and private banking, and banking services to small and middle-sized businesses in the region.</p>
        <p>In addition to the job cuts, the company announced a hiring freeze and the elimination of raises and bonuses for officers.</p>
        <p>Most of Bank of New England's layoffs will be in Massachusetts, where 800 jobs will be cut, and Connecticut, which will lose 450 jobs. About 90 jobs will be cut at Bank of New England-West, based in Springfield, Mass.; 160 in Rhode Island; 10 in Maine, and 200 at other locations, it said. The company has said it may sell the Rhode Island and Maine banks.</p>
        <p>According to the S.E.C. filing, the company's troubled loans probably increased in the first quarter of 1990. But the company added that its $1.5 billion reserve for loan losses at the end of 1989 included an allowance for losses from $1 billion of loans that ''were experiencing some financial difficulty'' at that time but not counted as troubled loans.</p>
        <p>The filing with the S.E.C. also said that the company might seek to exchange new shares for some of its $778 million of long-term debt, a move that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.</p>
        <p>Bank of New England stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $4.25.</p>
