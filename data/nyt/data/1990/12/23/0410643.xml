        <p>I HAD 20 SECONDS OR so to forgive, to ignore, or to deny absolution to this hateful man. I was not a priest, but a son; he was not a penitent, but my dad. The confessional was no cloistered corner of a church, but a Florida beach on a day of quiet winter softness.</p>
        <p>Mom had died that February, and I came down from Pennsylvania so my father wouldn't have to spend his first widower's Easter alone. We were sitting watching the ocean when he said: "You know, I treated your mother pretty rotten."</p>
        <p>He had, too, this vulgar, obnoxious, sometimes still abusive former alcoholic. He hadn't treated me so damn well, either. And I hated him for it.</p>
        <p>Now he was old and sickly. I think he sensed his own mortality and wanted to come to terms with his past.</p>
        <p>Hence, he made an admission that also implied a question. When he said, "I treated your mother pretty rotten," he was questioning whether such behavior could be forgiven. Would be forgiven by me.</p>
        <p>He was asking if I could repeat his statement, and add on the most powerful conjunction of our moral grammar: "I was rotten,</p>
        <p>but</p>
        <p>. . . ." "Yes, Dad, you were rotten, but you were no worse than any other husband-father . . .but I forgive you anyway, but . . . but . . . but . . . ."</p>
        <p>My</p>
        <p>question, then, was: Did the language my father and I spoke together, the language I learned from him, contain conjunctions or only simple sentences: I was rotten, You were rotten. Period.</p>
        <p>From the instant he finished his admission, the meter of my conscience began running. Every second I did not answer would lead to that moment when he would conclude I did not intend to, and that would itself be an answer. If I had a different answer, it had to be given then and there.</p>
        <p>Now he was reckless enough or desperate enough -- humble enough seemed out of the question to me -- to allow me to condemn him without the mercy of a qualifying "but." And to see his suffering when I did so, would be a great gift.</p>
        <p>Maybe you would have needed to see his fist knock my mother to the floor and feel the impotence of a 6-year old who has to watch it. Or to have witnessed his hurling every object in the kitchen he could get his hands on and feel an 11-year old's terror at the sight of it. Or to have been told that, if birth control hadn't been so much trouble, a monkey like you would never have been born.</p>
        <p>Maybe you would have needed all of this to feel the nearly blood-lust pleasure of pronouncing the simple sentence: "Yes, Dad, you really were a bastard!" And condemn him to live out that eradicable truth for as long as he had left.</p>
        <p>But I never said it; I chose not to deny him my personal sacrament of reconciliation. I said instead what, with my mind, with my emotions, with even my body that has its own form of truth-knowing, I believed to be a lie.</p>
        <p>I said: "No, Dad, like all us husbands, you did good and you did bad. Don't think of yourself as rotten, Dad, just human. That's why Mom could love you, I can respect you, Our Lord will forgive you."</p>
        <p>He kept staring out to sea, and said quietly, "Thanks."</p>
        <p>When his turn came to die, I was with him. I believe he died in peace. I imagine he felt forgiven and, since I had given it freely, perhaps he felt the even greater peace of believing he deserved it.</p>
        <p>Why, then, don't I have peace? Aren't we taught that being generous and kind makes one feel good? Aren't compassion and virtue supposed to be their own reward?</p>
        <p>So, why then did I do it? Because, on some level, I loved him and couldn't acknowledge it to myself in any other way? Or because it was the truth and, as a philosopher and teacher, who has spent life searching for and defending the little truth I could find, my reason overpowered my distorted, maybe even pathological, feelings?</p>
        <p>Or was it like it so often is between fathers and sons? A potent and narcissistic father manipulated, even into adulthood, his son into leaving his will unchallenged and obeyed?</p>
        <p>He willed to be forgiven; what is more, he willed to be forgiven</p>
        <p>freely</p>
        <p>. I forgave him. I did it freely. But did I? Or had I done what he had made me want to do, as he had since childhood, so that in the end he now has made freedom and necessity indistinquishable for me?</p>
        <p>And is this paradox, in which we are estranged from our own freedom and which is the characteristic way of being human, the reason a fair-minded God would forgive a son's lie and a father's rottenness?</p>
