        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I appreciated the coverage of Fillmore Center in the Western Addition section of San Francisco ("Tenanting a Big, Controversial Project," Dec. 9). Despite the problems reported, the project is now 95 percent complete. It is providing homes for an economically and racially integrated 600 families, many of whom are from the Western Addition.</p>
        <p>[ Clarifying the leasing picture as reported in the article, the Filmmore Center management said that 23 of 103 new units that came on the market Dec. 1 had been preleased, and 523 of 686 units that were previously available had been leased. Ultimately Fillmore Center is to have 1,113 apartments. In the retail component, 15,000 square feet is leased, the management said. ]</p>
        <p>The current development team has successfully moved toward completion of its several goals -- affordable housing, increased neighborhood employment, assistance to minorityes and women contractors, and the provision of neighborhood amenities.</p>
        <p>A total of 223 of the units, or 20 percent, are affordable to low-income households, while 335, or 30 percent, are affordable to middle-income households. The development has pumped more than $13 million in wages directly to the neighborhood workers. Special use and contracts for minority and women contractors generated contracts in excess of $21 million. Fillmore Center has provided a 16,000-square-foot community center, and careful design has made it possible to preserve nearly half the site as open space.</p>
        <p>As a 25-year resident of the Western Addition, I can attest to both the historical problems and the current successes of the Fillmore Center. Creating housing and new retail uses of this magnitude, which are good neighbors to our surrounding subsidized housing, has been a daunting task and one that is not yet finished.</p>
        <p>The agency remains committed to achieving its goals with this development in a way that embodies the best of urban design and city living.  LEROY KING  The writer is president of the San Francisco Redevelopment Commission.</p>
