        <p>Neither rain nor snow nor gloom of January get in the way of Adventure on a Shoestring, a not-for-profit group that offers walking tours of New York City neighborhoods. On Saturday it will make its way through Brooklyn Heights.</p>
        <p>Adventure on a Shoestring has been organizing its weekend outings for 28 years, and Brooklyn Heights has always been a favorite. It retains one of nation's most elegant, best-preserved collections of 19th-century brownstone residences and churches.</p>
        <p>Robert Goldberg, president of Adventure on a Shoestring, who will lead the 90-minute tour, said points of interest will include the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, once led by the abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher, the St. George Hotel, once the city's largest, and the Brooklyn Heights Esplanade.</p>
        <p>The tour, which starts at 1:45 P.M., costs $5. Part of the group will meet in Manhattan at 1 P.M. (at an address not yet determined) and go by subway to Brooklyn Heights, where they will meet others. Call 212-265-2663 for reservations and more information.</p>
