        <p>Japan's agreement this week to co-sponsor a proposal to open the world's banking and financial markets is aimed largely at protecting Japanese financial concerns from possible trade retaliation and is so vague it may not have any impact for years, a senior Government official here said today.</p>
        <p>Responding to reports on the proposal to promote a freer flow of trade in financial services, the Finance Ministry official also saw little effect on the Government's current policy of slow deregulation of the Japanese financial system.</p>
        <p>The move to liberalize trade in financial services is a small part of the struggle under way in Brussels to conclude a broader agreement to open markets to increased trade flows. But the hidden meanings behind this proposal illustrate how the whole trade-liberalization process has at times become ensnared by narrow national interests that could ultimately hobble the process, even as it appears to be moving ahead.</p>
        <p>To some extent, the new proposal is aimed at countries like Japan. Among the industrialized countries Japan was relatively late in granting outsiders access to its banking, securities and other financial businesses. It has made substantial progress since 1985, but it still lags, critics charge.  'Unfair Competitive Advantage'</p>
        <p>According to a just completed major report by the United States Treasury, "Despite modest improvements, a variety of factors have kept the Japanese banking market difficult to penetrate, and the slow pace of liberalization and deregulation has provided domestic banks with an unfair competitive advantage over foreign banks, both in Japan and globally."</p>
        <p>It was announced earlier that Japan had joined Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in proposing new rules that would, over time, make it easier for banks, securities companies and other financial concerns to offer their services in other countries. The proposal was made as part of a broader initiative to liberalize trade in services under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the body that regulates world trade.</p>
        <p>Japan felt strongly, along with the United States, that financial services were a unique form of trade that should be overseen by specialists. In general, finance ministries around the world jealously protect their regulatory powers from other business regulators.</p>
        <p>A senior Finance Ministry official here said that from Japan's perspective the proposal consisted of four main points: regulation intended to protect depositors and maintain the stability of financial markets would be permitted to continue; cross-sectoral retaliation by one country against another for resistance to market openings would not be permitted; a distinct body would be established to handle financial services issues, and lesser-developed countries would be permitted to open their markets more slowly than developed countries.</p>
        <p>The key point, the official said, was to stop a country from restricting the activities of Japanese financial institutions in that country in retaliation for Japan's refusal to open up a different market.</p>
