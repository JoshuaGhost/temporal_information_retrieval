        <p>Trans World Airlines agreed yesterday to sell its six routes between the United States and London to American Airlines for $445 million -- the latest sign that the country's strongest airlines are taking advantage of the troubles of their weaker rivals to acquire lucrative international routes.</p>
        <p>T.W.A.'s chairman, Carl C. Icahn, quickly made clear his plans for that money, immediately renewing his attempt to acquire Pan American World Airways.</p>
        <p>Last month Pan Am agreed to sell its London routes to United Airlines for $400 million. After the announcement of that deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, American said it too was interested in buying Pan Am's London routes, and Mr. Icahn made an offer for Pan Am that its board virtually ignored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn's latest offer to buy Pan Am was not contingent on an end to the Pan Am-United deal, as he had stipulated in his earlier offer. He said yesterday that by combining Pan Am and T.W.A., cash could be raised by selling overlapping routes. "What we want is a critical mass," he added.</p>
        <p>United States Government approval can take many months. If the deals are approved, United and American, the strongest United States carriers, will now compete head-to-head for business between London and the United States. Pan Am and T.W.A., the two American airlines that built their reputations through overseas travel but are now financially struggling, will no longer fly the most popular route.</p>
        <p>"It is a continuation of the strong-getting-stronger trend," said John V. Pincavage, a partner with Transportation Group Ltd., an investment banking firm that specializes in airlines.</p>
        <p>The gap has been growing between the strongest airlines and the weaker ones. Last year, Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. Earlier this month, Continental Airlines did the same. Both airlines are owned by Continental Holdings Inc., the former Texas Air Corporation.</p>
        <p>As the historical American "flag" carriers sell overseas routes, the buyers have been those carriers serving mostly domestic route networks. Such carriers have thrived since the deregulation of the American airline industry, which began in October 1978. United, American, Delta Air Lines Inc. and USAir Group Inc. have all established frequent service among many American cities and have each developed several "hub" airports, at which many passengers arriving from many different cities change planes for flights to their final destinations.  Direct Service by Rivals</p>
        <p>At the same time, partial deregulation of international air travel in the late 1970's has allowed more of T.W.A.'s and Pan Am's domestic competitors to offer direct service to foreign cities. American Airlines now offers, for example, nonstop service from Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina to Paris.</p>
        <p>Two decades ago, a traveler from North Carolina would have been obliged to change planes, most likely in New York, and would probably have ended up flying Pan Am or T.W.A. across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcements were the latest round in a dramatic reshuffling of properties in recent months. With the sharp increase in fuel prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, weaker airlines were in distress even as a lagging economy led to a drop in traffic. "The assets that are the most valuable are the ones that go first," Mr. Pincavage said.</p>
        <p>T.W.A.'s deal with American also calls for the sale of all its operations in Chicago, as well as those at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports in London, for $70 million. T.W.A., which dominates the St. Louis market, has relatively modest operations in Chicago.  Access Sought for Eight Years</p>
        <p>Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of the AMR Corporaton, which owns American Airlines, said the airline had been seeking access to Heathrow, where landing rights are at a premium, for eight years.</p>
        <p>American said it would use existing lines of credit and would sell some common stock in the first quarter of next year to pay for the T.W.A. deal.</p>
        <p>American's acquisition of T.W.A.'s routes into London and United's deal with Pan Am may well cause the British Government to scrutinize the impact of the changes of ownsership of the routes. "What is going to be the most interesting in all of this is to see what the British Government is going to do," Mr. Pincavage said.</p>
        <p>Under a treaty between Britain and the United States, only British Airways, Pan Am, T.W.A. and their "corporate successors" can fly trans-Atlantic routes out of Heathrow Airport.  Letter to Pan Am Chairman</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn, in a letter sent yesterday to the chairman of the Pan Am Corporation, which owns the airline, Thomas G. Plaskett, appeared to be increasing the pressure. "Tom, given the current state of the airline industry in general and the state of Pan Am in particular," he wrote, "it is incumbent on you and your board of directors to allow shareholders of Pan Am, to whom you and your board have a fiduciary responsiblity, to choose for themselves whether or not they wish to avail themselves of the opportunity I have offered."</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn said he was increasing the cash portion of his bid for Pan Am to $1.50 a share, with $1 in notes. The notes would trade at a large discount from their face value. In November, T.W.A. offered $1 in cash and $2 in notes.</p>
        <p>Pan Am's stock closed Friday at $1.25 a share, down 12.5 cents. The stock of UAL, which owns United, dropped $2.375, to $106.50, while AMR's stock fell $1.75 to $50. T.W.A. is privately owned, by Icahn &amp; Company, which is based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., where Mr. Icahn lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn would not say if he was prepared to make a tender offer for Pan Am's stock if the parent company's board reacts as it did to his earlier offer -- that is, basically to ignore it. Analysts See Sense in Merger</p>
        <p>Analysts said a T.W.A.-Pan Am merger would make some sense. "You might be able to make a stronger 'one' out of the weaker two," Mr. Pincavage said. "You could have some excess assets to sell off," he said, but added that it would be nice if one of the airlines possessed a London route.</p>
        <p>Both the Pan Am-United deal and the T.W.A.-American deals include joint marketing agreements, in which the airlines coordinate schedules to feed each other's flights and honor each other's frequent-flier arrangements. Some routes even overlap: both include flights to Heathrow from Los Angeles and from Kennedy and Newark International Airports in the New York area.</p>
        <p>United is also acquiring the rights to fly from Washington, San Francisco and Seattle to London. American is also acquiring the rights to fly to Heathrow from Boston and Philadelphia. Last December, American had agreed to acquire T.W.A.'s Chicago-London route for $110 million. The expiration date for that agreement, which is still awaiting Government approval, was extended by today's agreement.  Concern Expressed by Skinner</p>
        <p>A flurry of deal-making in the airline industry last year prompted Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to send a letter to the presidents of 28 commercial airlines, expressing concern about the buying and selling of Government-granted international air route authorizations.</p>
        <p>Lawrence M. Nagin, UAL's senior vice president and general counsel, said yesterday that he doubted that the completion of a second big international route sale agreement in two months would affect his company's plans. "United's Pan Am agreement stands on its own, and United is optimistic that Department of Transportation approval will be quickly forthcoming," he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nagin declined to comment on how American's move might affect United's marketing. International routes are particularly valuable because the overseas markets are growing faster than domestic ones, and analysts said American would be able to take far better advantage of the London routes than would T.W.A., which is losing millions of dollars a month.</p>
        <p>American has one of the strongest frequent-flier programs and computerized reservation systems in the country. "They have a better ability to fill up planes going to London than T.W.A.," Mr. Pincavage said. Icahn Cites Drop in Earnings</p>
        <p>The London routes were probably one of the few areas in which T.W.A. was making significant profits, analysts said. Yet, Mr. Icahn, in a statement, said the earnings from these routes had deteriorated in the last two years and that, with new competition from United, the earnings would almost certainly continue to erode.</p>
        <p>T.W.A. is currently one of the weakest airlines in the country, with a fleet of aging planes and debts estimated at more than $2 billion.</p>
        <p>For the first nine months of the year, T.W.A. lost $54.3 million on revenues of $3.58 billion. Pan Am, another very weak airline, lost $268 million on revenues of $3 billion for the first nine months of the year.</p>
        <p>AMR, on the other hand, earned $175.5 million on revenues of $8.7 billion for the first nine months of 1990. UAL earned $217.9 million, mostly through the sale of property, on revenues of $8.2 billion for the first nine months. A Long History</p>
        <p>T.W.A. was one of the early success stories of American aviation. Founded on July 13, 1925, as Western Air Express, it grew during the 1920's and 1930's as a major carrier of air mail as well as passengers. Howard Hughes became T.W.A.'s principal shareholder in April 1939, and in the years immediately after World War II built a globe-girdling set of international routes. Mr. Icahn gained control of the company in late 1985 and became its chairman the following year.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for British Airways P.L.C., the largest carrier between the United States and Britain with 37 percent of the market, declined to comment last night on the American-T.W.A. deal, other than to say, "We will remain competitive."</p>
        <p>British Airways has a joint marketing agreement with United that the two companies have said they will retain after United buys Pan Am's routes to London.</p>
