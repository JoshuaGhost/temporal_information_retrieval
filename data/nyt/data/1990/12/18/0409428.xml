        <p>The Director General of GATT, Arthur Dunkel, has called a meeting of Uruguay Round trade negotiators for Jan. 15, his spokesman said today.</p>
        <p>The four-year round to open global commerce, which was to have been concluded earlier this month in Brussels, was suspended to allow more time for differences to be resolved. But there is still no indication that positions have moved sufficiently, especially on the key area of farm subsidies.</p>
        <p>David Woods, spokesman for the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said the ambassador-level meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee would attempt to get the Uruguay Round moving again. The committee is the coordinating panel and consists of all 107 nations taking part in the current round of talks, which began in Uruguay four years ago.</p>
        <p>The ministerial meeting in Brussels earlier this month stalled because of sharp disagreement between the European Community and its trading partners over cutting costly farm subsidies, which the United States and other farm exporters Brazil say distort trade unfairly.</p>
        <p>European Community leaders meeting in Rome expressed regret on Saturday at the impasse in the talks but offered no new concessions.</p>
