        <p>The dollar strengthened slightly against most leading foreign currencies yesterday, buoyed by heightened concern over the potential for war in the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Gold prices rose slightly in New York, up 80 cents an ounce, to $377.50, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $376.50 an ounce, up 75 cents.</p>
        <p>Currency trading was sparse as participants wrapped up their positions for the end of the year in anticipation of the Christmas holiday.</p>
        <p>But the traders said new war talk by President Bush supported the dollar, generally considered a safe investment in times of turmoil.</p>
        <p>Since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, traders have focused on heightened war tensions there, often to the exclusion of economic factors that ordinarily might sway the market's direction.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's comments, Mr. Bush demanded again that the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, completely withdraw his forces from Kuwait by Jan. 15, the deadline imposed by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>There will be "no concession, no negotiation for one inch of territory," Mr. Bush said. "He has got to leave without condition."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was still willing to meet with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, on the gulf crisis if mutually acceptable dates could be arranged for the meeting, as well as for a reciprocal meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Mr. Hussein in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>"The dollar is definitely being propped up by the impression that maybe the situation in the Persian Gulf is deteriorating slightly," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank.</p>
        <p>The dollar strengthened slightly against the British pound, with sterling closing at $1.9305 an ounce in New York, down from late Friday's $1.9370. In London, the pound fell to $1.9290, from $1.9390 late Friday.</p>
        <p>The dollar was also slightly stronger against the yen, closing at 133.10 yen in New York, from late Friday's 132.85. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 133.10 yen, up from 131.87 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 133.15 yen.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.4870 German marks, up from 1.4825; 1.2745 Swiss francs, up from 1.2735; 5.0620 French francs, up from 5.0405; 1.1579 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1583, and 1,122.75 Italian lire, up from 1,119.75.</p>
