        <p>Looking for a Ship  By John McPhee  242 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux . $18.95.</p>
        <p>Good books, or for that matter any books, about American merchant seamen are in short order, particularly these days when the bookshelves are filled with volumes about other endangered species. With the virtual disappearance of the oceangoing United States merchant marine, it would take a writer like John McPhee, who worries about things being lost to a bewilderingly voracious technology, to tackle the subject.</p>
        <p>Unlike his nearly homonymous literary forebear, William McFee, a ship's engineer who became famous for writing sea stories, John McPhee is a literary landlubber who has chosen to write a nonfiction account of life at sea. "Looking for a Ship" is not Richard Henry Dana's "Two Years Before the Mast," nor was that the intention, but it certainly is a salty seascape of the American seaman today.</p>
        <p>His vehicle is the Stella Lykes, a 650-foot elongated Lykes Brothers Steamship Company freighter, which he joined at the suggestion of his friend Andy Chase, who had just got a berth as second mate. Mr. McPhee went aboard as a "person in addition to crew," in effect, a certificated kibitzer. He and the ship are off on a 42-day voyage to the west coast of South America from Charleston, S.C., touching Valparaiso, Chile; Callao, Peru; Buenaventura, Colombia; the Panama Canal, and other points along that long and mountainous coast. By the time he and we have debarked, we have come to know the crewmen and the routine aboard a modern cargo ship.</p>
        <p>The sailor's life has changed radically in the last 40 years. "The age of the sea bag is long over," Mr. McPhee writes. "A mariner can get on the ship with five suitcases if he wants to." There are private cabins for sailors, air-conditioning and mandatory television sets in the mess room.</p>
        <p>But there are reminders that all these are mere frills of a calling that routinely is at the mercy of weather and wave, with collision and shipboard accident always waiting, just off the starboard beam, with sinkings and vanishings still a possibility in seas that are more untracked than they might appear on a land-based computer screen. And on some runs, there are still pirates.</p>
        <p>But worst of all, for those who make their living at it, there are virtually no ships, or that was the case when Mr. McPhee wrote his book, before the Persian Gulf crisis created a demand for mariners. In the book, seafarers tensely wait for their number to come up in the hiring hall for a ship or a run they want; some unions won't allow their members to ship out for more than six months a year to insure that all hands get a chance at a job. The average age of the Stella Lykes's 32 crewmen is 51, and the captain sums up the situation: "This is now an old man's business. Sailing A.B.:" able-bodied seaman "it's an elderly gentleman's job."</p>
        <p>Back in the 1940's and 50's, a golden age, there were 2,000 ocean ships under the American flag. Mr. McPhee writes that the United States has about 400 deep-sea ships under its flag, run by three shipping companies. (Almost a score of American companies have perished since those halcyon days four decades ago.)</p>
        <p>Hold on there, mate. Mr. McPhee is too concerned a citizen and too good a writer not to paint the whole picture, but that's not what he's really up to.</p>
        <p>He's a romantic, even in the most casual, laconic way, and you can tell he dotes on talk of pirates, on the mention of strange ports and especially on those yarns that seamen spin. "Looking for a Ship" is not a treatise on the decline of the American merchant marine, anymore than "Moby-Dick" was meant to be a Journal of Commerce report on the whaling industry. Readers who are worried about this should be informed that there is not even an index.</p>
        <p>Style is what Mr. McPhee is loaded down to the Plimsoll marks in: felicitous phrases, keen observation, the knack of unloading a cargo of information without hitting the reader on the head with a jumbo boom.</p>
        <p>He has found congenial sources in his shipmates, whose generalizations have a poetic, but not a literal, ring of truth.</p>
        <p>"In Ecuador, my gosh, they're killing a prosecutor or a judge every day in the week," says the skipper, discussing drugs. An engine-room man, describing a close call at sea, says: "I almost lost my life. There were fish of every denomination in the water." After an appallingly graphic four-page report on modern maritime disasters, the author writes, "Somewhere, any time, someone is getting it."</p>
        <p>Mr. McPhee would have made a fantastic purser. He records everything, and the romance of sea trade, which carries 95 percent of the world's freight, shines through the cargo manifest, as the ship picks up and delivers spare tires, button-down shirts, cellophane, copper wire (to Chile, which is like carrying coals to Newcastle), a fire engine, 817 desks and 817 chairs along with 85 cartons of umbrellas and 9 tons of fruit cocktail.</p>
        <p>Those who sail the Stella Lykes are a competent, highly individual cast of characters, starting with the captain, a great-grandfather who might have been created by the people who coined the word "feisty." He runs a happy ship, has strong opinions on any subject, can't find his way around his home town when he's ashore and driving his car, but is a virtuoso ship handler, who delicately docks his ship, the length of Rockefeller Center, between two others in what the author calls a "problem in very tight large-scale parallel parking."</p>
        <p>Mr. McPhee's own cruise through the pages is not a simple here-to-there affair. The chapters do not sail as does the ship from one point to another; each picks up at a different position and tackles a different aspect of maritime living. Even within chapters, one topic leads to another, sometimes without any notice. It is a charming sort of garrulity and puts one in mind of a most articulate old sea dog who has swallowed the anchor and sits on a waterfront bollard telling his lubberly acquaintances about what happens out there, just on the other side of the horizon.</p>
