        <p>Sotheby's auction house issued international 1990 sales figures yesterday showing the sharpest declines since 1982 and representing what a top Sotheby's official said was "the beginning of a return to normalcy" in auction sales.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sales for the year totaled $2.4 billion, down from $2.9 billion for 1989, a 17.5 percent decrease, according to the auction house. Sales for the fall were $751 million, down from $1.5 billion a year ago, a drop of more than 50 percent. Sales at Christie's auction house, announced this month, were $1.96 billion for the year, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 1989. The companies' totals for the year were ahead of 1988. 'A Return to Normalcy'</p>
        <p>Michael L. Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, attributed the decline in sales to the "uncertain worldwide political and economic climate."</p>

        <p>Sotheby's auction house issued international 1990 sales figures yesterday showing the sharpest declines since 1982 and representing what a top Sotheby's official said was "the beginning of a return to normalcy" in auction sales.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sales for the year totaled $2.4 billion, down from $2.9 billion for 1989, a 17.5 percent decrease, according to the auction house. Sales for the fall were $751 million, down from $1.5 billion a year ago, a drop of more than 50 percent. Sales at Christie's auction house, announced this month, were $1.96 billion for the year, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 1989. The companies' totals for the year were ahead of 1988. 'A Return to Normalcy'</p>
        <p>Michael L. Ainslie, the president and chief executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings, attributed the decline in sales to the "uncertain worldwide political and economic climate."</p>
        <p>"It is probable that with the perspective of history, the sales explosion of 1989 will be viewed as the exception, and the levels of 1990 seen as the beginning of a return to normalcy," he said.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sales totals increased for silver, antiquities and jewelry in 1990, Mr. Ainslie said. A 101.84-carat diamond was sold for $12.8 million, the highest price paid at auction for a jewel. But the totals for the three most important selling areas -- Impressionist, modern and contemporary art -- were in sharp reversal.</p>
        <p>"The market has a history of expanding and contracting," said David J. Nash, who heads fine art sales at Sotheby's in North America. "The 1980's boom lasted longer than any other that I have known. The higher the mountain, the steeper the slope on the other side."</p>
        <p>The decline in sales this fall has made it hard to assess the values of Impressionist, modern and contemporary artworks, Mr. Nash said. "The prices they bring next year will determine the levels of the market," he added.</p>
