        <p>Money poured into short-term Treasury bills yesterday after the sudden resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Meanwhile, the year-end cashing in continued in the Treasury bond market, where prices fell and yields rose for the second straight session.</p>
        <p>The threat to Soviet political stability from Mr. Shevardnadze's departure rattled European financial markets early in the day, and pushed German, French and British interest rates up sharply.

        <p>Money poured into short-term Treasury bills yesterday after the sudden resignation of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Meanwhile, the year-end cashing in continued in the Treasury bond market, where prices fell and yields rose for the second straight session.</p>
        <p>The threat to Soviet political stability from Mr. Shevardnadze's departure rattled European financial markets early in the day, and pushed German, French and British interest rates up sharply. The news also generated a strong rally in the dollar, particularly against the German mark. Analysts said at least some of the money that fled into dollars was invested in Treasury bills.</p>
        <p>"If you want safety, you buy Treasury bills," said Joseph Liro, senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg &amp; Company. "The strong performance in the bill sector was related to Shevardnadze and the message he conveyed in announcing his resignation."</p>
        <p>By late in the day, three-month Treasury bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.53 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.53 percent.  Bond Sell-Off</p>
        <p>Dealers continued to sell Treasury bonds yesterday, though there was no news that prompted the price drop.</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of people who have generated a lot of paper profits over the past few weeks," one Government bond trader said. "That makes it very tempting to square positions and realize those gains before the end of the year."</p>
        <p>In late trading, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 105 3/4, down 5/8 point, to yield 8.22 percent, compared with a yield of 8.17 percent late Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Since Tuesday, when the bond market rallied after the Federal Reserve announced that it had lowered the discount rate, yields on the benchmark 30-year issue have risen by 15 basis points.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's decision by the First National Bank of Chicago to lower its prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent, had no impact in the credit markets. First Chicago is the largest bank thus far to cut its prime rate, but analysts expect many others to follow soon.</p>
        <p>In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at a price of 103 3/32, down 13/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 7 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, down 2/32, to yield 7.23 percent.</p>
        <p>Analysts suggested the price movements of the last two days have pushed yields on shorter-term notes to very attractive levels.</p>
        <p>"With the two-year yielding more than 7.20 percent and the Federal funds rate at 7 percent and on the way lower, once people come back from the holidays, they will like what they see," Mr. Liro said.</p>
        <p>In other developments, participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues dipped by a modest 1/8 point in fairly light trading.</p>
        <p>Trading was also light in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. Prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down about 1/8 point, according to market participants.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 12. The report had no impact on prices in the fixed-income markets.</p>
