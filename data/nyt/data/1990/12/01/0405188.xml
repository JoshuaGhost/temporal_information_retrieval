        <p>Prices that farmers get for raw products declined by seven-tenths of 1 percent from October to November, leaving the overall index below its level a year earlier for the first time in 14 months, the Agriculture Department said today.</p>
        <p>Lower prices were reported for hogs, milk, soybeans and corn, although higher prices for oranges, lettuce and strawberries helped soften the decline in other commodities.</p>
        <p>"Wool was at the lowest price level since January of 1986," the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report. "Milk moved to the lowest level since July of 1989."</p>
        <p>The November soybean price was the lowest in three years, the report said, and the farm price of wheat was the lowest since August 1987. Corn prices continued down, following a trend begun in July.  Hog Prices Down Sharply</p>
        <p>Hog prices, which had moved higher in October, dropped off sharply in November.</p>
        <p>But some increases were reported. Steer and heifer prices set another record, up 1 percent from the previous high in October. Peanut prices at the farm were the highest since January 1981</p>
        <p>Most prices are mid-November averages that will be revised next month. For example, the latest report showed October prices declined by 1.4 percent from September instead of the drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent indicated a month ago.</p>
        <p>No new figures were released to show how much farmers pay to meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly. The previous adjustment, announced in October, showed farm expenses jumped an average of 2.2 percent from July, with the index 5.6 percent above the October 1989 level. Officials attributed most of that quarterly increase, the sharpest since January 1982, to rising fuel prices.  Larger Output Expected</p>
        <p>This week department economists forecast that 1991 consumer food prices will climb an average of 2 percent to 5 percent, compared with a 6 percent increase in 1990. Larger output of some major commodities is expected to help cool the price climb.</p>
        <p>Based on the preliminary figures, the November price index for all crops was up 1.7 percent from October but averaged 3.9 percent less than a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The November index for livestock and products was down 2.9 percent from October but still averaged six-tenths of 1 percent more than in November 1989.</p>
        <p>Milk prices, reflecting stepped-up production, dropped 40 cents from October to November, to $12.80 for 100 pounds. The November price was down $2.80 from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The all-fruit price index in November was up 12 percent from October and was unchanged from the November 1989 average.</p>
        <p>Commercial vegetables rose 13 percent from October and 32 percent from November 1989.</p>
