        <p>The family of Brian Watkins, the Utah tourist slain in a subway mugging last summer, has notified the city that it intends to file a lawsuit seeking $100 million, the Comptroller's office said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The notice charges that the city and the Transit Authority, failed to provide "a competent, adequate and safe place for the general riding public" the night Mr. Watkins was killed.</p>
        <p>The notice of intent to sue charges that the authority did not properly train its token clerks to respond to emergencies or provide "adequate security devices."</p>
        <p>It also charges that the city Emergency Medical Services was negligent in its response and treatment of Mr. Watkins.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins, 22 years old, of Provo, Utah, was with his family when they were mugged Sept. 2 in a Manhattan subway station by a group of youths.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins interceded when one youth punched his mother in the face. He was stabbed in the chest and died a short time later. Eight suspects have been charged with murder.</p>
        <p>The family's lawyer, Charles S. Brofman, was out of his office yesterday and could not be reached for comment on when the suit would be filed, his secretary said.</p>
        <p>They have until December 1991 to file suit.</p>
