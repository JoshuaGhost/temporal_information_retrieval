        <p>A Brooklyn delicatessen worker was arrested yesterday and charged with raping two women at gunpoint in separate incidents in Brooklyn in the last week, the police said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Rafael Ojeda, 20 years old, of 450 40th Street in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, was accused of using a .38-caliber revolver to force women to go with him into a stolen car, where he would rape them, Sgt. Paul Byrd of the Police Department's Brooklyn sex crimes squad said. Mr. Ojeda was charged with rape, sodomy and armed robbery.</p>
        <p>Interviews with Mr. Ojeda's family drew a portrait of a young man who had struggled and failed to fulfill his family's dreams of college and a business career and was now working as an embittered employee of the family delicatessen, carrying a gun and lying about the stolen car he was driving.</p>
        <p>Parking tickets led detectives to Mr. Ojeda, Sergeant Byrd said. One of the rape victims remembered the license plate number of the car, a Mercury Cougar -- 6PA135 -- and detectives discovered by checking computer records that several parking tickets had been issued to a car with that plate on Sackett and DeGraw Streets in Brooklyn. The car was stolen at gunpoint at 51st Street and Third Avenue in Sunset Park on Aug. 18.  Stakeout at Car</p>
        <p>Tuesday afternoon investigators spotted the car in a parking space in front of 462 Sackett Street and staked it out, Sergeant Byrd said. At about 4:20 P.M., Mr. Ojeda arrived, got into the car and was immediately arrested by Detectives Timothy Mulhall, Bruce Palette and Andrea Sorrentino. The gun believed to have been used in the rapes was recovered from Mr. Ojeda.</p>
        <p>Several hours later, the two rape victims and the owner of the Cougar identified Mr. Ojeda as the attacker in three separate lineups, Sergeant Byrd said. Mr. Ojeda made statements to the police, the sergeant said, but he would not say whether they were a confession.</p>
        <p>Investigators said Mr. Ojeda was remorseful. "He made statements saying he needed help," a detective said.</p>
        <p>The first rape victim, a 27-year-old woman, was attacked at 7:30 A.M. on Saturday as she jogged along 84th Street near 13th Avenue, the police said. In the other attack, a 33-year-old woman was abducted and raped at 2:30 A.M. Tuesday near 80th Street and 19th Avenue on her way home from a party.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Byrd said Mr. Ojeda had no criminal record, came from an upstanding family and had entered St. John's University in Queens to study business.  Two Semesters</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ojeda had trouble in college. A vice president at St. John's, Martin Healy, said Mr. Ojeda left the school in June 1989 after only two semesters without earning a single credit toward a degree.</p>
        <p>"He had a good family," Sergeant Byrd said. "He had the best education. He's a smart kid. I guess the psychologists have to figure it out."</p>
        <p>Friends and family members said Mr. Ojeda, who was known by the nickname "Junior," grew up in Sunset Park, the youngest of three children of Rafael and Emma Ojeda. His father, who immigrated to New York from a small town in Puerto Rico in 1961, bought a deli at 179 Fourth Avenue, between Sackett and DeGraw Streets in central Brooklyn, and eventually invested in a four-story town house on 40th Street in Sunset Park, where the family lived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ojeda's mother, Emma, said her husband had bought her youngest son everything he wanted, even buying him three new cars as presents in the two years after he graduated from high school.</p>
        <p>"There is no reason for Junior to do this," Mrs. Ojeda said yesterday. "A person who rebels against his family would do something like this. But there is no reason for Junior to do it. His father gives him everything."</p>
        <p>Then she added, "If he had given him a few slaps, maybe it would have been better."</p>
