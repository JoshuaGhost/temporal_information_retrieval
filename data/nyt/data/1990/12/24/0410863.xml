        <p>Injury by injury, X-ray by X-ray, the Super Bowl XXV playoffs are turning into the Backup Bowl I playoffs.</p>
        <p>Now that Troy Aikman is out with a separated shoulder, if the Dallas Cowboys qualify as the National Conference's third wild-card team, they will be using a backup quarterback, Babe Laufenberg, if he survives their season finale next Sunday in Atlanta. With the Giants and the Chicago Bears each already dependent on a backup quarterback in Jeff Hostetler and Mike Tomczak, half of the six N.F.C. playoff teams might be without their best quarterback when the Super Bowl tournament begins.</p>
        <p>Pending next week's medical bulletins, Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers, Randall Cunningham of the Philadelphia Eagles and Mark Rypien of the Washington Redskins are currently the only healthy N.F.C. playoff passers with the stature of an established starter.</p>
        <p>And with Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers having suffered a dislocated thumb on his throwing hand yesterday, the American Conference playoffs also will be influenced by backup quarterbacks. With Jim Kelly out with a damaged left knee, the Buffalo Bills used Frank Reich yesterday in clinching the Eastern Division title in a 24-14 triumph over Miami.</p>
        <p>After the rash of quarterback injuries the last two weekends, the 49ers yesterday kept Montana on the sidelines in casual clothes. Steve Young absorbed their 13-10 loss to the still-alive New Orleans Saints that delayed the Cowboys from achieving an unprecedented turnaround: The first team to qualify for the playoffs following a season in which it won only one game.</p>
        <p>Despite the loss of Phil Simms with a sprained foot, the Giants could be the beneficiary of the quarterback epidemic that cost the Bears Jim Harbaugh, out with a dislocated shoulder.</p>
        <p>In the Eagles' 17-3 victory over the Cowboys here yesterday, Babe Laufenberg threw four interceptions while completing only 13 of 36 passes, including a streak of 13 consecutive incompletions. Aikman, the second-year quarterback who had guided the Cowboys into playoff contention, was crushed into the artificial turf by Clyde Simmons, an Eagle linebacker, on his second pass.</p>
        <p>If the Bears, as the Central Division champions, were to win their likely first-round game against the Saints or Cowboys, the Bears would come to Giants Stadium for a second-round game with Tomczak as their quarterback -- if Tomczak survives.</p>
        <p>For the Giants, opposing Tomczak theoretically would be better than having to go against either Cunningham or Rypien, a scenario that would develop if the Cowboys or the Saints somehow were to upset the Bears with the 31-year-old Laufenberg as their quarterback. With only Laufenberg available, the Cowboys were reported to be considering signing David Archer or Doug Williams off the street as their new backup.</p>
        <p>In the confusion, Cunningham and Dan Marino of the Dolphins have emerged as the N.F.L.'s most durable quarterbacks. Each will be starting his 58th consecutive game next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Asked for an explanation, Cunningham said: "I train like a running back. I lift weights like a quarterback. And I have a lot of faith in God. I pray that He keeps me healthy."</p>
        <p>Another factor is that Cunningham doesn't have to confront the pass-rush of the Eagles, who have now recorded five quarterback knockouts in their last eight games. The victims were Stan Humphries and Jeff Rutledge of the Redskins, Chris Miller of the Atlanta Falcons, Steve Grogan and now Aikman.</p>
        <p>Some knockdown timekeepers also include Anthony Dilweg of the Green Bay Packers, but others insist that Dilweg damaged an arch in taking a bad step before 285-pound Reggie White fell on him.</p>
        <p>With the coaching rivalry between Buddy Ryan and Jimmy Johnson as a backdrop, Cunningham thought that yesterday's Eagle-Cowboy game deteriorated into "dirty football." Cunningham acknowledged that some of his teammates were "chop-blocking illegally." But in the Cowboy locker room, Aikman absolved Simmons of any malicious intent.</p>
        <p>"I saw him coming," Aikman said of Simmons's blitz early in the first quarter. "He hit me as soon as I got rid of the ball. I'd hate for anybody to suggest that he was trying to hurt me. When a very aggressive, very physical player hits you that hard, you can get hurt. I don't think it's their intention to put a quarterback out."</p>
        <p>To their credit, the Eagle pass-rushers weren't gloating about their quarterback knockouts, at least not in their locker room.</p>
        <p>"You don't try to do it, but if it happens, it's an advantage," said Mike Golic, a 275-pound defensive tackle. "You get a backup in there, he hasn't taken many snaps, he hasn't had the time to get much experience. Laufenberg had happy feet out there. He was looking to move around."</p>
        <p>"It just happens," said White, the All-Pro defensive end. "But you don't exult."</p>
        <p>"Some people are trying to soften the game up, make it a gentlemen's game," said Seth Joyner, a 240-pound linebacker. "But we don't play it that way. We go out there to play as hard as we can. If we get a good clean hit on a guy, we hit him. If he gets hurt, it's just the way he falls."</p>
        <p>As the Super Bowl playoffs approach, the Eagles have now won two in a row after losses to Miami and Buffalo.</p>
        <p>"We've had what amounts to two shutouts in a row, no touchdowns," Joyner said, alluding to a 31-0 rout of the Packers a week ago. "I hope we're starting to peak going into the playoffs. You have to be at a peak because if you lose one, you're out."</p>
        <p>As the Eagles learned in their playoff opener in each of the last two years. But now they own one of the few healthy quarterbacks in Super Bowl contention.</p>
        <p>"When Blair Kiel came in for the Packers a week ago after Dilweg got hurt, the first time he took the snap, he got rid of it awful fast," said Terry Hoage, an Eagle safety. "Lots of backup quarterbacks, that first couple of snaps, they look scared to death."</p>
        <p>In the playoffs, some backups will still look that way.</p>
