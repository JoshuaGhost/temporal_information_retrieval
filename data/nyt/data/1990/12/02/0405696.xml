        <p>On Sunday the Germans will once again cast ballots as a united nation, concluding an extraordinary passage that began 12 months and 21 days ago, when the Berlin wall abruptly fell open.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the distance the Germans have traveled in that brief time that on the heady November night in 1989 when people danced on the ruptured wall, nobody dreamed that unity was imminent, while now the Germans approach unified elections already with a dose of boredom.</p>
        <p>The feeling may not be that surprising after so extraordinary and condensed a year -- it is already the fourth time, for example, that the east Germans will be casting free ballots in less than 10 months.</p>
        <p>Besides, for all the historical significance of the first free election in a united Germany since 1932, in technical terms the balloting is simply to elect the 12th Parliament since the Federal Republic was formed in 1949. The only difference is that the number of districts and seats has been increased.  Few Immediate Changes Seen</p>
        <p>The reason is that under the conditions of unity on Oct. 3, East Germany was simply absorbed into the Federal Republic as five additional states, changing neither the constitution nor the basic election format. The difference is that 72 new election districts and 12 million eligible voters have been added.</p>
        <p>In addition, the elections are not expected to lead to any immediate differences -- public-opinion polls leave relatively little doubt that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition will be returned to office, the Government will probably remain in Bonn for at least several years more, and the numerical predominance of western Germans will probably insure that fundamental policies remain the same.</p>
        <p>The latest poll, published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine today, predicted that Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats would win 42.5 percent of the vote nationwide, and that their coalition partners, the Free Democrats, would win 10 percent. The Social Democrats were predicted to take 34.5 percent nationwide.</p>
        <p>One telling finding was that the Social Democrats were expected to take only 24 percent of the vote in east Germany, compared with 44 percent for the Christian Democrats. Part of the Socialists' problem in the east is that the Party of Democratic Socialism, the reformed Communist Party, is expected to take about 10 percent of the vote in the east.  Foreboding About the Future</p>
        <p>A less tangible factor in the sedate mood on the eve of elections is the sense that the balloting marks the end of the grand transition and the beginning of the hard and risk-filled task of rebuilding Germany and defining its place in a tumultuous new world.</p>
        <p>"The election is the last fling of the party that began when the wall came down," said a veteran Western diplomat. "His victory may in fact prove to be Kohl's high point, and his next four years may be hard."</p>
        <p>The foreboding is shared by a preponderance of pre-election commentaries in the German press that have focused on the challenges that will immediatedly confront the new government. Internally, that is the huge cost of rehabilitating east Germany and the growing anticipation of social disorder as the east Germans come to increasingly resent their poverty and separateness.</p>
        <p>To many Germans, east and west, monetary and political union has only served to underscore the depth of the differences between the two parts of Germany and the difficulties of putting it back together. Nobody doubts any longer that taxes will rise.  'This Is a Foreign Land'</p>
        <p>In Weimar, a center of German history brought low by 40 years of Communist neglect, Hartwig Krieg, a West German international banker sent to assist the city administration, said: "I've lived abroad for many years, and I'm still living abroad. This is a foreign land."</p>
        <p>"According to all expectations, Helmut Kohl will be rewarded for the trust that he has created in the course of the past year," wrote Dieter Schroder in the Suddeutsche Zeitung. "But his problems will only start there. There is a lot to do before the conditions of life in all parts of the country are equalized."</p>
        <p>As it confronts its internal problems, Germany will also be learning to cope with the responsibilities and duties of its wealth, size and recovered independence.</p>
        <p>"The Germans may find that this is the end of a pleasant childhood," said the Western diplomat. "West Berlin is sort of an allegory for West Germany and West Europe -- the division was unbearable, but it protected them from a lot of real problems and decisions. It gave them an excuse not to deal with the world. Now they have to accept the messiness of the world, they can't sit out crises like Iraq, they have to act on the chaos in the East."</p>
        <p>A UNIFIED GERMANY VOTES FOR PARLIAMENT</p>
        <p>THE CANDIDATES The elections are for a new federal Parliament. The new, all-German Parliament will have 656 deputies, 72 of them from the former East Germany. It will be the biggest German Parliament since 1945. The party or party coalition that wins a majority of the seats in the Parliament then elects a Federal Chancellor, who will be confirmed by the President and who will assemble a cabinet within 30 days after the elections. Forty parties and groups are running for seats. Under existing rules, a party must win at least five percent of the vote to enter parliament. For this election, the federal Supreme Court ruled that a party must receive five percent of the vote in either the former East Germany or in the former West Germany. The rule was altered to give some of the smaller Eastern parties a chance of being represented. THE PROCEDURES</p>
        <p>Every voter has two votes. With the first, the voter chooses a local constituency candidate. With the second, the voter chooses a party. The voter can split first and second votes between two parties.  The first vote is in a direct election of candidates in districts.</p>
        <p>The second vote is for a party, determining the party's proportionate strength in the Parliament. A party redeives seats in Parliament in proportion to the votes it receives on the second ballot, and it then fills those seats with candidates elected directly, and partly with candidates drawn from party lists.  That way, all the parties obtain a place on their lists for their big names. Helmut Kohl, for example, has not won his constituency in the last four Parliamentiary elections, and probably will not win it this time. But as the No. 1 on the Christian Democrats' list in Rhineland-Palatinate, he is sure to get into Parliament.</p>
        <p>THE ELECTORATE</p>
        <p>The elections of Nov. 6, 1932, are regarded as the last free all-German elections. There was one more election (March 5, 1933) that was formally free, but by then, Hitler had already begun his chase of Communists and the Social Democrats, especially after the burning of the Reichstag on Feb. 27, 1933. THE HISTORY</p>
        <p>The elections of November 1932 brought the Nazis their first humiliation since 1930. The Nazis lost 2 million votes and 34 seats in the Reichstag. The Social Democrats also lost a few seats, while the German Nationalists emerged with 11 more seats. The Communists gained 14. The hope was at the time that the disintegration of the political center had ended. In March 1933, there were Communists and Social Democrats on the tickets. But in fact, most of their leaders had been in hiding since Jan. 30, 1933, the day Hitler came to power.</p>
