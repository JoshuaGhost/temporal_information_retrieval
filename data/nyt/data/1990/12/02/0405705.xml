        <p>This is another in a series of columns answering readers' questions about New York's changing streetscapes.  72 First Street</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The 1857 obituary of my great-grandfather, George Cole, gives his address as 72 First Street. Is the five-story building there now the one he occupied at his death? . . . Jane C. Weaver, Rahway, N.J.</p>
        <p>A.  George Cole "coachman" first appears at this address in 1852, perhaps employed by Carsten H. Koope, a grocer who owned and also occupied the building, a frame structure at the northwest corner of First Street and First Avenue. But the brick tenement now on the site was built about 1868, after his death.  Parc V Predecessor</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>My grandfather lived in an apartment building at the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, since replaced by the Parc V apartments. When was this grand old building built and where could I find a plan of the apartments?</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>John Lane, Bronxville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.  Designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh in 1903, 787 Fifth Avenue was built with full-floor apartments. Plans for most upper-class apartment houses were published in renting compendiums like Pease &amp; Elliman's "Catalogue of East Side New York Apartment Plans." An edition in the late 20's -- available in the Avery Architectural Library at Columbia University -- shows that this building'sapartments had three master bedrooms, three servant rooms and a library, living room and dining room. The 10-story building was built by the Van Norden Trust Company which occupied the ground floor.  4 East 39th Street</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The building at 4 East 39th Street has busts of Rembrandt and Whistler. Why? . . . Lois Evans, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A.  This four-story building was built in 1905 as a store for Frederick Keppel and designed by George B. Post &amp; Sons. Keppel, who probably commissioned the busts, was active as a print dealer in New York City after the Civil War, speculating in the work of Whistler, Zorn and Pennell. He was the author of several works in the field including "Modern Disciples of Rembrandt." He died in 1912, but his son David continued the firm, building a new store at 16 East 57th Street in the 20's. Post Office Mystery</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The main post office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue has an empty niche on each side of the building, flanking the steps. Was anything ever in them? They look so empty. . . . Jackie Butler, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A.  Photographs taken after completion show the niches empty. Construction drawings for the building, designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White in 1908, are held by the New-York Historical Society. The curator there, Mary Beth Betts, says the original construction drawings show the niches you mention without statuary. But preliminary renderings of the building do show statuary groups of three figures each in each niche.  161 West 61st Street</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I was born Oct. 28, 1916, at 161 West 61st Street. What was the name of the hospital there? My father's address is listed as 360 West 15th Street; is that building still standing? . . . James R. Maedler, North Bergen, N.J.</p>
        <p>A.  The 61st Street building was at the northeast corner of Amsterdam Avenue and was ccupied by the New York Infant Asylum. The present apartment building at 360 West 15th Street, called the Kingsland, was built in 1910 and was on the site in 1916 when your father lived there.  The Nevada</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>My parents and I lived for a few years in the Nevada at 2025 Broadway. I returned a few years ago but could not locate it. Has it been remodeled? . . . Viola Mitzian, Hartsdale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.  No, it has been razed. The Nevada occupied the triangular plot bounded by Broadway, Amsterdam Avenue and 69th and 70th Streets. Built in 1891 as an apartment hotel, it was designed by Thom &amp; Wilson for John T. Farley, although it was leased out upon completion to a hotel operator. It was demolished for the present Nevada Towers, completed in 1977.</p>
        <p>Koehler's Store</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The enclosed photograph shows Louis Koehler, in the suit, in front of the Koehler Electrical Store somewhere on the Upper West Side about 1910. My father, Richard J. Kernan, apprenticed in the store and is about 15 in the photograph; he is marked with my mother's "X." Where was the Koehler shop? . . . Richard Kernan, New Paltz, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Luisa Koehler "electrician" is listed at 204 West 100th Street in this period and the buildings in the photograph correspond with those in period maps. Her son, Louis, was also in business with her.</p>
        <p>130 and 140 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I've always admired the matched pair of buildings at 130 and 140 West 57th Street even though they seem to have had a hard life since they went up. When were they built? . . . Robert Beard, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A.  These buildings were intended for artists and went up in 1908 to designs by Pollard &amp; Steinam. They were put up as cooperatives and the original syndicates were apparently arranged by the artist Robert Vonnoh, who was involved with earlier cooperative studio construction on West 67th Street. In 1907, he built 39 West 67th Street, designed by the same architects.</p>
        <p>The original configuration of 130 and 140 was five apartments to a floor, with two simplex apartments at the rear, two duplex apartments (with double height studios) and one nonhousekeeping studio at the front. In the 1910's many artists lived in the buildings and the painter Childe Hassam was a longtime resident of 130; the unusual trapezoidal window appears in some of his paintings of interiors.</p>
        <p>Author William Dean Howells also lived in the building.  127-129 East 19th Street</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>The two two-story buildings at 127 and 129 East 19th Street have interested me for years. Were they both once stables? Jeanne Geib . . . Manhasset, L.I.</p>
        <p>A.  Yes. The building at 127 was put up in 1854 as a stable by Charles R. Harbeck for his adjacent house at the northeast corner of 19th and Irving Place.</p>
        <p>No. 129 was built in 1861 as a stable for the family of James Couper (or Cowper) Lord, whose house backed up to it from 24 Gramercy Park. It is not clear just when the stable occupancy ended.</p>
        <p>An alteration application filed by architects Hoppin &amp; Koen in 1898 described 127 as a studio and a similar application filed by architect August Pauli in 1903 described 129 as a studio being converted to a private dwelling. In 1904, the Real Estate Record and Guide described 129 as a building "that excites interest and admiration" but most of its Gothic Revival detail probably dates from its original construction, not later alteration work.</p>
        <p>Census records and directories prior to the 1920's generally do not list the buildings and only a few occupants are known. Robert W. Bruere, an "agent," lived in 127 around 1910 and Samuel Bettle and Francis Cushing Green, both businessmen, occupied 129 around the same period.</p>
