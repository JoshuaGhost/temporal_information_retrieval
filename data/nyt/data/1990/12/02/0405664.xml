        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was depressed to read the article by Stuart Meyers, "A Company Gives Up on New York" (Forum, Nov. 4). But I was even more depressed to read the ad hominem attacks written in response. The question is not whether Mr. Meyers should have purchased insurance. The question is why insurance rates are so high given the amount spent on the criminal justice system. And given the increases in water charges in the last decade, why can't the city provide pipes that don't rupture? Not one writer responded to the real problem: Why can't this city provide services commensurate with the amount spent on services? Unless it does, people will continue to vote with their feet to the detriment of the city, the state and this country. PHIL GOODMAN  New York, Nov. 26</p>
