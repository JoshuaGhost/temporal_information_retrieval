        <p>Brazil is prepared to pay $1.2 billion in interest arrears on commercial bank debt before the end of the year, the newspaper Jornal do Brasil reported on Saturday. A Brazilian mission will travel to New York within a week to meet with the banks, the newspaper said. The banks have demanded that Brazil, which has a total foreign debt of $119 billion, pay $2.5 billion in arrears this year before renegotiations on some $60 billion in public-sector commercial debt can begin. Government officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
