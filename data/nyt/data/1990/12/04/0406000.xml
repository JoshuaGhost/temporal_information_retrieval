        <p>What a pleasure it was to watch Kelly Cass and Peter Boal in "Valse-Fantaisie." Ms. Cass made her debut in this exquisite ballet by George Balanchine at the Sunday afternoon performance of the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>She and Mr. Boal danced extremely well. What's more, these two young people performed as if they enjoyed the choreography and the opportunity to be together on stage.</p>
        <p>Set to a delectable waltz by Glinka, "Valse-Fantaisie" demands ease, quickness and lightness of its interpreters. Ms. Cass looked as weightless as a leaf in the wind. But every step was carefully shaped and under control. When she crossed the stage in a series of leaps during a short solo sequence, she created the illusion before she descended from each leap that, if the choreography had not demanded otherwise, she could have continued soaring. As a result, one was more conscious of the way she took to the air than of how she touched the ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boal was a gallant cavalier when he partnered Ms. Cass. His dancing in the solo passages possessed strength, but not force. His jumps were high; his landings, soft.</p>
        <p>The New York City Ballet has always been noted for its speed. This performance suggested that the company's dancers may be growing ever more mercurial. Not only were Ms. Cass and Mr. Boal in fine form, but there were also deft performances by the members of the ensemble: Allison Brown, Stacey Calvert, Marisa Cerveris and Miriam Mahdaviani.</p>
        <p>The program, conducted by Donald York, opened with a repeat performance of "Concerto Barocco," in which the dancing was smooth but bland and the playing of Lamar Alsop and Alan Martin, the two violin soloists, was occasionally harsh. There were also repeat performances of "Four Gnossiennes" and "Scotch Symphony."</p>
