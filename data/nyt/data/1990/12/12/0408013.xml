        <p>Fiction With Solutions</p>
        <p>With less than three weeks remaining to enter the $500,000 Turner Tomorrow Award, probably the biggest prize ever offered for a single book, the manuscripts are beginning to flood in. "We're now getting over 100 a day," said Mary Jane Batson, the manager of the Turner Publishing Company.</p>
        <p>The awards for fiction, including four prizes of $50,000 each, were announced 13 months ago by Ted Turner, the chairman and president of the Turner Broadcasting System.  Their aim, he said, is to encourage writing "that creates positive solutions to global problems."</p>
        <p>All five books are also to be published in hard cover by Turner Publishing Inc., and the grand prize winner is to be guaranteed a minimum printing of 50,000 copies with a $50,000 budget for advertising and promotion.</p>
        <p>Almost 25,000 people sent for the entry kits with the rules and the forms that must be submitted with the manuscript, Ms. Batson said.  Those rules require that manuscripts be unpublished works of fiction from 50,000 to 100,000 words, and that the stories be set in the near future and end with the survival and prosperity of all life on the planet.</p>
        <p>"We've had many entries from aboard, including quite a few from Bulgaria," Ms. Batson said. "We also have many from Australia, maybe because Rodney Hall is an Australian."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall is one of the nine judges, along with the publishers Ian and Betty Ballantine and the writers Ray Bradbury, Carlos Fuentes, Nadine Gordimer, Peter Mathiessen, Wallace Stegner and William Styron.  Thomas H. Guinzburg, the former head of the Viking Press, is the managing director of the awards.</p>
        <p>After the manuscripts are screened by what Ms. Batson described as "professional readers," the judges are to decide among the 30 to 40 finalists. The winners are to be announced on June 3 during the convention in New York of the American Booksellers Association.  A Benefit for New York</p>
        <p>When the book "This Is Really a Great City" is published next spring, the cover will consist of a scene from "Manhattan," the 1979 motion picture with Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Mr. Allen gave permission for its use because the book is to be the centerpiece of an unusual money-raising effort next April on behalf of New York City.</p>
        <p>The Carol Publishing Group plans to print some 1.2 million copies of the book, a revision of "You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet!: 501 Famous Lines From Great (and Not-So-Great) Movies" by John P. Fennell. Much of the revision consists of lines from movies about New York. Retailers will buy the book for $5 and sell it for $7.95, and they will be encouraged to remit the difference to the city. Among the retailers that have already agreed to carry the book during April and turn the proceeds over to the city, are the more than 2,000 stores in the Waldenbooks and B. Dalton/Barnes &amp; Noble chains.</p>
        <p>"We expect to raise between $5 million and $10 million for the city," said Steven Schragis, the owner of the Carol group, who conceived of the program and enlisted the support of the Association for a Better New York. "We expect the book to be carried in almost every place with a cash register, from delis to department stores." Even $10 million isn't a lot of money in a city with the financial problems of New York, but it will be directed to a few hard-pressed areas, including drug education and after-school recreational programs. North Point Finale</p>
        <p>Among the last books that North Point Press will publish before calling it quits as a publisher next spring is a new novel by Evan S. Connell: "The Alchymist's Journal," to be published in April. While best known for the nonfiction "Son of the Morning Star," which was on The New York Times best-seller list, Mr. Connell is also the author of the novels "Mrs. Bridge" and "Mr. Bridge," published in 1959 and 1969, respectively. Those novels are the basis for "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," the current motion picture starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Although both "Bridge" books were published long before North Point was established, in 1980, North Point brought both of them back into print in 1981 and recently issued movie tie-in editions.  A Rizzoli Best Seller</p>
        <p>Rizzoli International Publications has been publishing books in this country for 15 years, most of them lavishly illustrated books on architecture, photography and the fine arts.  Its book on Picasso and Cubism, for example, includes 1,501 illustrations and sells for $250. Now Rizzoli has its first best seller, a book co-published with Eastman Kodak: "New Kids on the Block" by Lynn Goldsmith.</p>
        <p>Because there have been any number of New Kids best sellers, Rizzoli conducted an informal survey at the June convention of the American Booksellers Association, asking whether the market could bear another one. The booksellers said yes after learning that what Rizzoli had in mind was an oversize book (12 inches by 14 inches) with more than 200 color photographs, selling for $24.95 in paperback, $39.95 in hard cover.</p>
        <p>By August, more than a month before the book was printed, bookstores placed orders for the entire scheduled first printing of 60,000 copies.  The stores have since ordered all 100,000 copies of the second printing and a third printing is likely next month.</p>
        <p>While Rizzoli has no plans to abandon its usual publishing program, it has a book scheduled for fall titled "Redhead" by Joel Meyerowitz, a collection of photographs of people with red hair.</p>
