        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest your article on Nov. 4 headed "New Routes to Westchester Preservation." As chairman of the board of the Nature Conservancy's Lower Hudson chapter, I would like to clarify some of its points.</p>
        <p>The article states that the Conservancy has been known to sell preserves once they lose their environmental integrity. It is not the policy of The Nature Conservancy to sell its preserves. The sale of the Yonkers Preserve was an anomaly. The Lower Hudson chapter decided to sell the land only after every effort was made for its transfer to a more appropriate agency and only after the original donor agreed that its sale was the correct action to take. It was with great reluctance that we took this course.</p>
        <p>Hidden Meadows is an example of a tradelands project in which the land was given to us specifically for the purpose of selling it. The tradelands program was in its infancy at that time, and based in part on our experience at Hidden Meadows it is now our policy to restrict development, where appropriate, on any tradelands given to us.</p>
        <p>The Nature Conservancy is an international organization with an extraordinary track record of successes. Because we have been protecting land in Westchester County since 1953, we are uniquely equipped to promote land protection efforts throughout the county. Indeed, our expertise was invaluable in the formation and development of the Westchester Land Trust. There is much work to be done in land preservation, and we are pleased to see that so many groups have risen to the challenge.  AMY DAVIDSON  Katonah, N.Y.</p>
