        <p>With their desks and cabinet tops overflowing with pots and tubes of cleansing mineral masks, multi-active day creams and cereal poultice, a team of young Conde Nast editors is feverishly preparing for the Feb. 26 debut of Allure, Conde Nast's newest women's magazine.</p>

        <p>With their desks and cabinet tops overflowing with pots and tubes of cleansing mineral masks, multi-active day creams and cereal poultice, a team of young Conde Nast editors is feverishly preparing for the Feb. 26 debut of Allure, Conde Nast's newest women's magazine.</p>
        <p>Billed as a "journalistic magazine about beauty," the monthly will report on new beauty products, address questions about pricing and packaging, examine marketing strategies and analyze trends. It will not, however, rate products.</p>
        <p>"We'll criticize if something sounds like a lot of hokum," said Linda Wells, Allure's editor in chief. "But mostly the way to do this is as a good reporter. We will ask a company why they are coming out with a new moisturizer, do they think it's better than their last one and was there anything wrong with the last one." 'Fair and Balanced'</p>
        <p>"The point is to be responsible, fair and balanced," Ms. Wells said.</p>
        <p>Magazine industry analysts are skeptical about whether a magazine that takes a hard look at the beauty industry can survive. Cosmetic companies have traditionally placed advertising only in publications with a "supportive editorial atmosphere." One ad agency media planner, who insisted on anonymity, said that if his clients "knew they were getting editorial mentions that were not favorable, they would pull the schedule."</p>
        <p>In 1987, when Conde Nast's Traveler began publishing serious examinations of the travel industry, advertisers at first expressed alarm. But the magazine was so well received by readers that advertisers quickly decided to embrace the magazine too. Conde Nast is betting the same will be true with Allure.</p>
        <p>"They have asked me questions people have never asked me before," Matt Rubel, president of the specialty store division at Revlon Inc., said about Allure. "They are looking to really tell their readers what the best products are and why and how to use them. I find it refreshing." Why Start It Now?</p>
        <p>The overriding question about the start-up of Allure is, of course, why now? With most magazine advertising declining, newsstand sales lagging and postal rates about to rise, this is considered a dismal time to start a new publication.</p>
        <p>But S. I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast, said: "I don't think there is such a thing as a good time or a bad time to strt a magazine. A magazine is an idea and a group of creative people who are interested in the idea. If you wait for the right time, you'd never put out a magazine."</p>
        <p>Conde Nast already owns Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Bride's and Self, all of which have beauty coverage. One question being asked is whether Allure will take ads away from its sister publications.</p>
        <p>"I think other magazines, both ours and non-Conde Nast magazines, are going to have to deal with it -- that's competition, that's how publishing works," Mr. Newhouse said.  No Restrictions Promised</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Wells would decide whether to criticize products, "We haven't in any way tried to draw lines around the magazine," he said.</p>
        <p>This year has been a relatively good one for beauty advertising in magazines. Of the 10 ad categories tracked by Publishers Information Bureau, toiletries and cosmetics ranked third for the first nine months of 1990, with a 6 percent increase in revenues over a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Media directors and advertisers are reacting to Allure with both interest and caution. Bette Chabot, director of advertising at Saks Fifth Avenue, said, "We always opt for something new and fresh to come along, and all of us in the fashion and beauty world have to watch closely because it could become a major player."</p>
        <p>When word spread last summer that the first dummy of the magazine had been ripped up by Conde Nast's editorial director, the art director replaced and some staff dismissed, rumors flew that Allure would not make it to the starting gate. But, the magazine's publisher, Kathy Neisloss, said, "It just wasn't cooked yet."  No Guidelines on Profits</p>
        <p>Mr. Newhouse declined to disclose the cost of starting Allure or to say how much time he would give the magazine to make a profit.</p>
        <p>"We have no corporate guidelines that say Allure has to be at a certain point by a certain year," he said. "I've never had the problem, except with Woman, of not having a magazine show the kind of vitality and progress that made it clear that we were on the right track."</p>
        <p>Woman, a mass-market monthly magazine, was closed by Conde Nast earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Neisloss said Allure would guarantee advertisers a circulation of 200,000, with a goal of 500,000.</p>
        <p>The strongest card that Allure has, according to magazine analysts, is Conde Nast's record as a publisher of successful women's magazines.</p>
        <p>"They are probably the only company in the world that can pull it off," said Martin Walker, president of Periodical Studies Service, a magazine consultant.</p>
