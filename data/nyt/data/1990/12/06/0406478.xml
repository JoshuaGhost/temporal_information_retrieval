        <p>Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told America's strongest European supporters in the Persian Gulf crisis today that President Bush, the Congress and the people of the United States had not lost their nerve.</p>

        <p>Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told America's strongest European supporters in the Persian Gulf crisis today that President Bush, the Congress and the people of the United States had not lost their nerve.</p>
        <p>"The only acceptable outcome is total withdrawal of Iraqi forces from all of Kuwait," he told a group of British generals, scholars and policy makers, assuring them that war, if it came, would be "as quick and decisive as possible."</p>
        <p>Seeking to reassure British officials about American resolve without creating the impression that the United States was spoiling for a fight, General Powell said, "If Saddam Hussein withdraws peacefully, then we will have achieved our objective with the restoration of the legitimate government of Kuwait."</p>
        <p>He spoke in a lunchtime address to the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in the 17th-century Banqueting House, near the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, and answered questions.</p>
        <p>How long the new Prime Minister, John Major, thinks that sanctions should be given a chance to work is not known. Britain decided last week to send 14,000 more troops to the gulf by the end of January, which would bring the British total to over 30,000. Complete Withdrawal Urged</p>
        <p>WARSAW, Dec. 5 -- Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said today that the United States, in coming talks with Iraq, would accept nothing less than release of all the hostages and complete withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, the first American Defense Secretary to visit Poland, said: "There is no room for compromise on the basic, fundamental bottom line of the United Nations resolutions, which call for the complete and total withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the release of all hostages. I don't know anyone who would suggest that we should allow Saddam Hussein to give back just some of the hostages or some Kuwait."</p>
