        <p>The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced a $90-a-share, $6 billion hostile cash tender offer for the NCR Corporation yesterday after NCR's board rejected A.T.&amp; T.'s all-stock bid for the same amount.</p>
        <p>NCR said that it would be prepared to negotiate if A.T.&amp; T. offered $125 a share, or $8.5 billion. But an A.T.&amp; T. spokesman, Walter Murphy, said, "We view that price as outrageous and totally unjustified."</p>
        <p>Analysts said that while it was unlikely that NCR would sell for so much, the company was, in effect, placing itself up for sale by setting a price.</p>
        <p>'A Bargaining Point'</p>
        <p>"I would characterize $125 a share as simply a bargaining point," said Jack Grubman, analyst with Paine Webber Inc. "The notion of remaining independent has gone by the wayside," he said.</p>

        <p>The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced a $90-a-share, $6 billion hostile cash tender offer for the NCR Corporation yesterday after NCR's board rejected A.T.&amp; T.'s all-stock bid for the same amount.</p>
        <p>NCR said that it would be prepared to negotiate if A.T.&amp; T. offered $125 a share, or $8.5 billion. But an A.T.&amp; T. spokesman, Walter Murphy, said, "We view that price as outrageous and totally unjustified."</p>
        <p>Analysts said that while it was unlikely that NCR would sell for so much, the company was, in effect, placing itself up for sale by setting a price.</p>
        <p>'A Bargaining Point'</p>
        <p>"I would characterize $125 a share as simply a bargaining point," said Jack Grubman, analyst with Paine Webber Inc. "The notion of remaining independent has gone by the wayside," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grubman and other analysts said that they expected A.T.&amp; T. eventually to acquire NCR at a somewhat higher price than $90 a share.</p>
        <p>The hostile bid was made after a 50-minute meeting between NCR's chairman, Charles E. Exley Jr., and A.T.&amp; T.'s chairman, Robert E. Allen. The meeting, which was requested by Mr. Exley, took place in the offices of NCR's law firm, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp; T. moved quickly to make its cash bid after the stock offer was rejected. It lined up as advisers Morgan Stanley &amp; Company, the Wall Street investment house; Martin Lipton of the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, who made his name in takeover defenses, and Sidley &amp; Austin, the Chicago-based law firm. The company is expected to challenge NCR's shareholder rights plan and to begin a proxy fight to replace members of the board.</p>
        <p>Resignation Threatened</p>
        <p>Mr. Exley of NCR has threatened to quit if A.T.&amp; T. acquires the company.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, in a conference call with analysts, Robert M. Kavner, a top executive of A.T.&amp; T., said the company was determined to press its bid despite Mr. Exley's pledge to resign. Analysts said that Mr. Kavner hoped that Mr. Exley would remain with the company, but Mr. Kavner said that while A.T.&amp; T. needed the senior engineering staff of NCR, it could afford to lose some executives.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mr. Allen rejecting A.T.&amp; T.'s stock offer, Mr. Exley wrote, "We will not jeopardize the imprtant values we are creating at NCR and sacrifice a successful American computer company in order to bail out A.T.&amp; T.'s failed strategy." He also called the takeover attempt "a desperate attempt to salvage A.T.&amp; T.'s disastrous foray into the computer business." A.T.&amp; T. has had consistent losses with its computer business since entering the field in 1984.</p>
        <p>Despite such language, analysts viewed NCR's response as an attempt to get A.T.&amp; T. to raise its bid. Mr. Grubman of Paine Webber said that A.T.&amp; T. could pay up to $110 a share for NCR, with the deal still making economic sense.</p>
        <p>In announcing the tender offer, Mr. Allen questioned NCR's ability to go it alone. "We are entering an era in which the survival of stand-alone computer companies will be sorely challenged, particarly from abroad," he said.</p>
        <p>In a separate letter to Mr. Exley, the A.T.&amp; T. chairman wrote: "All we have is a difference of opinion on price. We should let your shareholders decide."</p>
        <p>The tender offer will expire at midnight, Jan. 4, 1991, unless it is extended. A.T.&amp; T. is not expected to have trouble obtaining financing.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp; T. was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with more than 5 million shares changing hands. The stock closed down 25 cents, at $30.125 a share. More than 2.4 million NCR shares were traded, and it closed up $3.125 a share, to $86.625.</p>
        <p>Bruising Fight Ahead</p>
        <p>With yesterday's announcement, A.T.&amp; T. and NCR began to brace for what promises to be a bruising takeover fight similar to those of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Several Wall Street investment banking firms were said to be trying to join the battle as advisers. For example, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, was said by Wall Street executives to be preparing a presentation for the NCR board.</p>
        <p>"If there is an investment bank that is not trying to get hired by someone here, they're asleep," One investment banker said.</p>
        <p>Investment bankers believe that the two companies will have to hire additional firms because of the size and complexity of the potential deal. Few large deals during the 1980's were run by a single firm, and Dillon, Read &amp; Company, the mid-sized firm that is advising the NCR directors, is not known as a defensive powerhouse in the takeover business.</p>
        <p>At the same time, A.T.&amp; T. was said to be in contact with a number of other companies to block any attempt by NCR to find a "white knight" that would acquire the company in a friendly transaction.</p>
        <p>"They are attempting to chill other bidders," one person involved in the situation said. "Very few people are willing to take on A.T.&amp; T, particularly a non-U.S. company."  Array of Defenses</p>
        <p>Even if no other bidders come into the process, however, A.T.&amp; T. would have to overcome an array of NCR anti-takeover defenses.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the NCR board authorized several steps that Wall Street executives said were intended to give it more negotiating power.</p>
        <p>First, the company lowered the threshold at which parts of its poison pill would come into play. That is a provision designed to fend off unwanted suitors. Now, if a hostile suitor acquired 15 percent of the company, elements of the poison pill would become effective, compared with the prior level of 20 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition, NCR opted out of an anti-takeover protection provided to the company under Maryland state law, where it is incorporated.</p>
        <p>While the protection at first appears to benefit the company, it includes a provision that would have allowed the shareholders to remove the board of directors if 80 percent of the shareholders approved of a takeover bid. By opting out of the protection, NCR also prevented its shareholders from voting its board out under the 80 percent rule.</p>
