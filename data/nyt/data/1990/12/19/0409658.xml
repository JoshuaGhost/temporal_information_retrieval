        <p>Stirring a new round of criticism from college administrators and civil rights activists, the Education Department today left intact a key provision of a plan banning scholarships designated exclusively for minority students.</p>
        <p>The move was something of a surpise, coming on the day the department had been expected to abandon its objections to racially based scholarships.</p>
        <p>Under the policy announced at a news conference today by Michael L. Williams, the department's Assistant Secretary for civil rights, colleges could award such scholarships as long as the money came from private donations designated for that purpose or from Federal programs set up to aid minority students. Colleges would not be allowed, however, to use money from their general operating budgets for the scholarships. This is the source of much of the money private colleges use for minority scholarships.  Sununu Playing a Role</p>
        <p>Under the earlier policy announced a week ago by Mr. Williams, colleges and universities receiving Federal funds would not have been allowed to award scholarships on the basis of race or ethnicity, even if private contributors had earmarked the money for that purpose.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the White House insisted that President Bush had been surprised and embarrassed by the announcement of that policy, and officials there said John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, had ordered its reversal. Several newspapers, including The New York Times, carried articles saying that the policy would be reversed on Mr. Sununu's orders.</p>
        <p>But the headlines and first paragraphs of some of the articles were overstated. The full articles made clear that Mr. Sununu had told lawyers from the Education and Justice Departments that they might consider drawing a legal distinction between money donated specifically to aid minority students and money that comes from the college's general operating budget. And that is what Mr. Williams did today. Bush Still Not Pleased</p>
        <p>His halfway measure infuriated civil rights groups and seemed to leave Mr. Bush, who has tried to keep the issue at arm's length, less than happy and uncertain about the future course of education policy on minority scholarships.</p>
        <p>"I have long been committed to them," Mr. Bush said, said at a news conference at the White House. "I have long been committed to affirmative action and so I hope the ruling -- some of it's quite technical -- will acomplish that end.</p>
        <p>"But I would like to think that the matter can be resolved with finality this way," he said. "But I don't think that's what we've done. I think there'll probably be some court challenges to this."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush defended today's action, asserting in response to a question that it was not "a flip-flop." But White House officials said privately that he was unhappy with the outcome. They also continued to say that the Administration did not want to throw Mr. Williams, one of its highest ranking black offficials, over the side, while at the same time criticizing him for acting without consulting the White House.</p>
        <p>At the news conference today to announce the change, Mr. Williams said that he had been "politically naive" in initiating the ruling against all race-specific scholarships.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Williams ruling earlier this month, public and private colleges and universities could use any funds from any sources for minority students scholarships.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams ruled that any "race-exclusive" scholarships were discriminatory and therefore illegal.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement states that such scholarships would be permitted if a donor of the money specified that it was to be set aside for minority students.</p>
        <p>"This is not a retraction, it's confusion," said Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education. The organization represents 18,000 colleges and universities around the nation. "I think they didn't want to totally lose face. They probably wanted to stick by their guns to some degree for political reasons. They had to do something because of the firestorm. But the firestorm will now continue." 'Just a Softening'</p>
        <p>Tim Christensen, associate director of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said: "It would be a lot better if they would retract the whole thing. This is just a softening."</p>
        <p>Mr. Christensen said that today's action had caused "quite a bit of confusion."</p>
        <p>"At what point do donor funds become university funds?" he asked. "My fear is that the ultimate answer -- since this is a matter of law -- will have to be decided in courts."</p>
        <p>At his news conference, Mr. Williams dismissed speculation that because he is black he had been used to float a policy opposed by many civil rights organizations. "I haven't been a lackey for anyone," he said. "The position I took was a position I took because I thought it was right."</p>
        <p>He said felt that his interpretation had been legally correct but that there were other equally valid legal interpretations of the law and that today's announcment came after consultations with the White House. Mr. Williams said he made his original ruling without such consultation.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has strongly opposed quotas or programs that specify race as a requirement in such areas as jobs, schools and housing.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Williams's action annoyed Mr. Bush, who said he disapproved of it and learned of the decision only through news reports.  Bush Wants Them Continued</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, at his news conference, insisted that the new policy would "continue these minority scholarships as best we can."</p>
        <p>"For now we have worked the regulation so we can continue to have these kinds of scholarships," Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Mary Berry, a commissioner on the United States Civil Rights Commission, said the new ruling invited legal complaints. 'Invitation for Lawsuits'</p>
        <p>"This is an invitation for lawsuits and complaints filed with the Education Department by people who wish to undermine the programs and affirmative action," she said. "This is a wholesale assault on these programs and people shouldn't be fooled."</p>
        <p>Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of Indepndent Colleges and Universities, said, "This is an awful blow to our institutions because the majority of the money that we're using for minority scholarships is not out of endowment funds."</p>
        <p>Mr. Christensen said that organization did not have any data on the number of scholarships or schools affected by the newest ruling.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Williams said that he did not have any idea of the number either and that his office had not done any survey of the field before he made his original ruling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, who came from the Justice Department, said he did not realize his action would create so much opposition.</p>
        <p>He viewed his office as "an enforcement agency" he said, adding, "We just looked at the law straightforward."</p>
