        <p>Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has complained that cuts in his budget request demanded by Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, would harm services to 50 million Americans who benefit from Social Security, Medicare and other Federal health programs.</p>
        <p>In a confidential letter, Dr. Sullivan also complained that Mr. Darman was interfering too much in the operation and management of the giant Department of Health and Human Services, which accounts for 35 percent of all Federal spending.</p>

        <p>Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has complained that cuts in his budget request demanded by Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, would harm services to 50 million Americans who benefit from Social Security, Medicare and other Federal health programs.</p>
        <p>In a confidential letter, Dr. Sullivan also complained that Mr. Darman was interfering too much in the operation and management of the giant Department of Health and Human Services, which accounts for 35 percent of all Federal spending.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan asserted that Mr. Darman's budget proposals would delay payment of Medicare benefits to the elderly and Social Security benefits for disabled people, provide too little money for prenatal care and restrict health care for members of minority groups and low-income people. Effect on Programs</p>
        <p>He also said that the Darman proposals would cut Medicare payments to teaching hospitals in inner-city neighborhoods and make it more difficult for elderly people to get information over the telephone about Social Security.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan's comments came in response to Mr. Darman's preliminary decisions on the 1992 budget, which President Bush will submit to Congress in early February 1991. A copy of Dr. Sullivan's letter, sent to Mr. Darman on Friday, was obtained today from a budget expert who said he regarded many of Mr. Darman's proposals as misguided.</p>
        <p>In a personal declaration of independence, Dr. Sullivan wrote, "We intend to treat any detailed directions and requirements" in the proposal as advisory only. To underline his point, he said, "Specific staffing levels and management arrangements must be left to responsible policy officials and program administrations" in the department, and must not be dictated by Mr. Darman's office. Decisions Are Being Appealed</p>
        <p>Some similar decisions by Mr. Darman have been appealed by other Cabinet officers, but Dr. Sullivan's protest is the strongest so far and has proved the most difficult to resolve, Administration officials said.  Aides to Mr. Darman declined to discuss details of Dr. Sullivan's letter, but they said they believed that all disagreements could be resolved amicably.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, have said that many executive agency officials do not understand the severity of the limits on domestic spending that were imposed by Congress in the budget bill passed in October.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman's preliminary decisions on the budget for the fiscal year 1992, which begins Oct. 1, 1991, were distributed last week to all agencies.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan's letter did not specify the total amount of money involved in his disputes with Mr. Darman. But he did request particular amounts for certain programs, and the requests taken together would cost several billion dollars. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the agency spent $439 billion, while the Federal Government as a whole spent $1.25 trillion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan said the Social Security and Medicare trust funds were "solvent and serving their clients daily." But he said, "The means of providing those benefits are seriously threatened by the level of resources for their administration" suggested by the Office of Management and Budget.  Statutory Deadlines Imperiled</p>
        <p>He further warned: "Our ability to respond to the needs of 50 million aged and disabled beneficiaries will be seriously eroded. Social Security Administration will experience systemwide backlogs which will be especially apparent in such high-visibility areas as disability claims, where processing times will grow by one-third and appeals will take a month longer to review. Medicare providers and beneficiaries will soon notice the deterioration in service delivery, as fiscal year 1991 Medicare claims processing times grow to 50 days, well in excess of statutory payment deadlines."</p>
        <p>In other words, he said, elderly and disabled people, doctors and hospitals would have to wait longer for Government payments they are entitled to receive.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan said, "The outlook for fiscal year 1992 is even more bleak." At the level of resources provided by Mr. Darman, he said, "Social Security Administration will see the backlogs of disability claims double, increasing from three to six months."</p>
        <p>More than half of all callers to the agency's toll-free telephone number would get a busy signal on some days, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman's budget allowance would force the Health Care Financing Administration, which operates Medicare, to reduce its 3,000-member staff by 22 percent, Dr. Sullivan said, and the average time for handling Medicare claims "would increase to 80 days." A Plea for More Money</p>
        <p>In his letter, Dr. Sullivan pleaded with Mr. Darman for more money to combat "disgracefully high rates" of infant mortality.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Secretary said, "we are deeply concerned about the scope and content of the proposed reductions in spending for Medicare benefits," especially Mr. Darman's proposal to cut Medicare payments to teaching hospitals. Many of those hospitals are in inner-city neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan also requested additional funds for the Food and Drug Administration, saying the growth of its staff had not kept pace with the explosive growth in new uses of medical technology.</p>
        <p>"Excluding staff associated with new problems arising during the 1980's -- for example, AIDS and generic drugs -- F.D.A. staff actually decreased by 16 percent between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1991," Dr. Sullivan said.</p>
        <p>He said he was seeking $785 million for the food and drug agency, which has a budget of $690 million and a staff of 8,000 people in the current fiscal year. The Government could raise $220 million if it required drug companies to pay "user fees" for F.D.A. services, he said. A Question of Trust</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan's letter only hints at a problem pervading the executive branch: Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies said they did not completely trust Mr. Darman when he told them that no extra money was available for domestic programs in the coming year. They have no way of independently verifying his account until the President's budget for all agencies is issued in February.</p>
        <p>To help offset the costs of his own proposals, Dr. Sullivan suggested cutting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, to $468 million, and he said such aid should be concentrated in Northeastern states, where low-income residents are most likely to use fuel oil to heat their homes.</p>
        <p>For the current fiscal year, Congress provided $1.4 billion, plus a contingency fund of $200 million. The money is now available to low-income people in all states.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan affirmed his support for proposals to charge "application and user fees" to people who enlist the help of the Federal Government in collecting child support payments.</p>
        <p>He objected to Mr. Darman's proposal to take away the department's responsibility for assistance to homeless people who are mentally ill or who abuse alcohol and drugs. Mr. Darman wanted to transfer the responsibility to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but Dr. Sullivan said his department had more expertise in serving such people.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan's letter shows how the Government must now make choices among groups of needy people. To get $42 million for homeless people with the most severe problems, he said, "we would eliminate the Emergency Community Services Homeless Assistance Program," which helps poor people find and keep shelter.</p>
