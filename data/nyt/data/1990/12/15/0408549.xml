        <p>Leaders of the European Community agreed in principle today to give the Soviet Union $2.4 billion in emergency food and medical aid and technical assistance, amid warnings that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev must be bolstered against challenges from hard-liners.</p>
        <p>They also discussed the possibility of offering hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency aid to Eastern Europe after hearing a report that democratic advances in those formerly Communist countries were imperiled by economic crisis.</p>
        <p>Help for the European Community's troubled eastern cousins dominated talks as the 12 national leaders gathered in Rome to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis and to propel the community toward fuller political and monetary integration. Except for Britain, all have agreed to move toward a single European currency, and they are now expected to set in motion a process that could ultimately lead to regional foreign and security policies.  A Less Combative Stance</p>
        <p>The summit meeting, held here because Italy holds the community's rotating six-month presidency, marked the international debut of Britain's new Prime Minister, John Major, who has sought from the start to project a less combative image than his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher.</p>
        <p>"I don't think anybody in the community wants a confrontation," he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to agree with her colleagues on rapid monetary union left her isolated at a meeting here in October, and the political fallout at home led to her being unseated. Though Mr. Major took a gentler tone, he suggested that Britain still had strong reservations about a process that could eventually involve a significant loss of national sovereignty for each of the 12 members.  Price of Aiding Gorbachev</p>
        <p>But the emphasis today was on the Soviet Union's troubles, and it was evident that the Western European leaders consider it at least as important to support Mr. Gorbachev politically against challenges from hard-liners as it is to feed Soviet citizens acing winter shortages.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany told his 11 colleagues at the meeting that "quite clearly, old hard-liners in the Soviet Union are trying to hinder developments with deliberate sabotage." A spokesman quoted Mr. Kohl as saying that it was worth the price to help Mr. Gorbachev now because "it would cost us much more" if he should fail.</p>
        <p>A similar warning came from Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, who told journalists, "It is not in the interests of Europe, it is not in the interests of Britain, that the Soviet Union should lapse into anarchy or that the Soviet Union should fall back into the hands of some backward-looking tyrant."</p>
        <p>Some of the European Community's 12 members, notably Germany, have already begun on their own to ship food and medicine stockpiles to Moscow, but the program essentially decided today goes considerably further. It also augments an announcement by President Bush two days ago that he had approved up to $1 billion in United States Federal loans to allow Moscow to buy food and other agricultural products.  Admission to I.M.F.</p>
        <p>The European program calls for swift distribution of $1 billion in food and medical assistance, with care to be taken that the aid truly reaches the Soviet people and does not fall by the wayside or into the hands of black marketeers. Several leaders expressed concern today that Moscow's real problem is not a shortage of food, but rather a distribution system that has broken down.</p>
        <p>How much food $1 billion would buy depends on what commodities are purchased. At today's price, $1 billion would buy about 400 million bushels of wheat.</p>
        <p>Figured another way, the Agriculture Department has determined that $70 a week is the minimum required in the United States to feed a family of four. At that rate, $1 billion would feed about 15 million families for a week.</p>
        <p>"All, without exception, agree to give the Soviet Union immediate aid," said Pio Mastrobuoni, the chief Italian Government spokesman. But there were "slight differences" among the 12 leaders, Mr. Mastrobuoni said, on how much of the package should come as direct grants and how much as loans.</p>
        <p>The Western Europeans also agreed in principle to give Moscow $1.4 billion over the next two years -- about $550 million in 1991 and $850 million in 1992 -- in the form of technical assistance for improvements in transportation, energy supplies and telecommunications.</p>
        <p>But the head of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, cautioned the 12 leaders that ultimately they could not help the Soviet Union by themselves, and that they should smooth Moscow's admission into the International Monetary Fund as soon as possible.  Loans and Shaky Finances</p>
        <p>Mr. Delors proposed that two-thirds of the $1 billion emergency aid come in the form of credits because, he argued, outright donations would send the wrong signal to hungry nations in Africa and Asia that also need help. But nations that favored direct grants, including Germany, France and Britain, contended that loans would further weaken the Soviet Union's already shaky finances.</p>
        <p>As for Eastern Europe, Mr. Delors recommended $340 million in emergency food and energy assistance for Bulgaria and Romania, and reported that Czechoslovakia had asked for at least $900 million. Hungary has already received $470 million in community help and has asked for $660 million.</p>
        <p>Between the collapse of the Eastern bloc's creaky trading system and higher oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis, Eastern Europe's emerging democracies have lost billions of dollars, Mr. Delors told the 12 leaders. According to a spokesman, he said, "There is a grave risk that these countries will become bankrupt and the democratic reforms will be stifled."  KREMLIN EXPLAINS SHORTAGES</p>
        <p>MOSCOW, Dec. 14 (AP) -- Soviet food shortages are caused entirely by distribution problems and economic disarray, not a lack of food, and emergency steps are needed to resolve the crisis, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, Stanislav S. Shatalin, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shatalin said in an interview: "Hunger is not an issue. There's enough food. The issue is how to find it and distribute it so that it doesn't get into the hands of the mafia, saboteurs and corrupted elements."</p>
        <p>The newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported today that the K.G.B., searching Moscow warehouses for hidden food, found nearly 2 metric tons of meat, 750 cans of instant coffee and 880 pounds of butter in one shop.</p>
