        <p>Mark Bavaro said today that the National Football League's report of his run-in with a game official two weekends ago "has some inaccuracies, some discrepancies, some bias." But he said he would pay the fine, reported to be $7,500, in addition to the automatic $500 fine for anyone ejected from the game.</p>
        <p>The incident happened in the fourth quarter of the Giants' 31-13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Bavaro had just been penalized 15 yards for hitting an Eagle after a touchdown. He argued about the penalty with Dave Hamilton, the umpire, and put his hands on Hamilton's chest. Hamilton fell. Bavaro said Hamilton tripped. Hamilton said Bavaro pushed him down, and Bavaro was penalized 15 yards more and ejected.</p>
