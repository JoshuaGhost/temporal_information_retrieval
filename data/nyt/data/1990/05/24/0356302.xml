        <p>LEAD: With a camera lens no larger than a matchbook, and microphones that can pick up a whisper in stereo, ABC will be an attentive visitor along for the ride Sunday in the Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>With a camera lens no larger than a matchbook, and microphones that can pick up a whisper in stereo, ABC will be an attentive visitor along for the ride Sunday in the Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, with the miniature equipment and high-tech replays that are becoming the norm, television viewers and broadcasters have become almost more like participants than observers at sports events.</p>
        <p>''I'll never let technology interfere with the event,'' said Curt Gowdy Jr., the coordinating producer of ABC's ''Wide World of Sports'' and producer of the network's broadcasts of the Triple Crown horse races.</p>
        <p>New Race Rule Possible</p>
        <p>Yet technology is having its impact. ABC's use of small cameras mounted on Indy racing cars may lead to a new rule. Because the aerodynamics of cars carrying cameras may be altered, all cars, rather than just a few, in future Indy 500's may have to carry cameras, as a means of assuring fairness.</p>
        <p>In this year's Kentucky Derby, the microphone worn by Carl Nafzger, the trainer of Unbridled, the winning colt, gave viewers an unusually vivid experience of the race.</p>
        <p>Neil Howard, the trainer of the Derby runner-up, Summer Squall, said he had declined to wear a microphone during the Derby because he was afraid he might make an off-color remark. Nafzger, though, consented to wear a microphone, and ABC got lucky.</p>
        <p>Sunshine produced a glare on the television monitor above the box Nafzger was sharing with Unbridled's 92-year-old owner, Frances A. Genter.</p>
        <p>Viewers Share Drama</p>
        <p>''It was glaring and she couldn't see the television,'' Nafzger recalled. ''I told her, 'Don't worry, Mrs. Genter, I'll call the race for you.' ''</p>
        <p>The result was one of the more touching moments in sports television, as Nafzger described Unbridled's winning performance to the colt's owner. Nafzger conceded that he had forgotten he was wearing the microphone in the excitment of seeing his horse win the race.</p>
        <p>The success of the Derby broadcast has prompted the question of whether jockeys will be the next subjects to be outfitted with microphones. And Gowdy said in an interview that he did prod officials at Pimlico Race Course about allowing jockeys to wear microphones during the running of the Preakness Stakes last Saturday.</p>
        <p>But state racing commissions take a dim view of a jockey's riding with any sort of electronic device.</p>
        <p>Seeing It Again</p>
        <p>Still, the Derby and the live telecast of this Sunday's Indy 500 suggest that television is well equipped to produce a show within a show.</p>
        <p>Already, television is part of the action at many events in ways that weren't always customary. At baseball games, for example, a home run is cheered twice. The second time comes when the big stadium scoreboard screen shows a replay.</p>
        <p>Television's present and future impact on sports participants and sports audiences is a subject likely to face increasing consideration.</p>
        <p>In the hours before the Preakness, for example, Al Michaels, the ABC broadcaster, waited and wondered.</p>
        <p>''How,'' Michaels asked, thinking back to the Derby, ''can we top that show?''</p>
        <p>It was an interesting question. For viewers, Unbridled's victory in the Derby will perhaps be twinned forever with Nafzger's shouted call of the race into the ears of the colt's owner. Would viewers have experienced the same drama without Nafzger's microphone?</p>
        <p>Most of the people who will watch the Indy race broadcast will be unaware that CART, the governing body of the Indy-type races, came close to passing a rule this year that would have placed a camera in every car, although most of the cameras would have been dummies.</p>
        <p>The reason? ABC has been placing its miniature cameras on the rollbars of selected cars, those the network figures can win, or at least be competitive. For Sunday, the network has chosen to place cameras with 6 of the 33 drivers: Rick Mears, Michael and Mario Andretti, Bobby Rahal, Teo Fabi, and Al Unser Jr. Mears drives for the Penske racing team. Last year, Penske's chief engineer, Nigel Bennett, said he did not want a camera in one of his cars.</p>
        <p>Bennett was concerned that there was not enough time to test the camera, which measures five inches at its widest and weighs less than a pound, in a wind tunnel, to determine what, if any, effect it would have on the car's performance. Some engineers have said that a camera of that size could present balancing problems or affect the car's aerodynamics.</p>
        <p>Fairness Sought</p>
        <p>To insure that camera-equipped cars were not at a disadvantage - or an advantage - CART proposed that every car run with a camera, or at least something having the same size and weight as the cameras some of the cars would be carrying.</p>
        <p>The proposal was not accepted this year, but will likely be part of the rules next season.</p>
        <p>''The potential exists to have an advantage in the way you set up the camera,'' said Steve Horne, president of the Budweiser Truesports racing team, for whom Raul Boesel is racing. With proper angling, for example, the camera might provide an aerodynamic advantage.</p>
        <p>For the sponsors of the six drivers whom ABC has selected this year, though, having the cameras in the cars is a bonanza. The camera shoots over the driver's right shoulder, its wide-angle lens displaying the right side of the driver's helmet, along with the track ahead of the car.</p>
        <p>Strategic Placement</p>
        <p>The major sponsors have have placed their emblems on that side of the helmets for the first time, as well as inside the car, so that the camera can pick up the corporate name.</p>
        <p>Bob Goodrich, the producer of the Indy 500 for ABC, said an even more significant change for viewers was the fact this would be the first Indy broadcast in stereo.</p>
        <p>''We're going to attempt to put microphones where the key wives sit,'' Goodrich said. ''Remember last year, Unser's and Fittipaldi's wives?'' The cameras captured Teresa Fittipaldi's joy as her husband led for most of the race, then her despondency after Unser took the lead, then her happiness after Fittipaldi took over the lead with less than two laps left.</p>
        <p>''Now we'll hear them,'' Goodrich said. ''But we're not trying to eavesdrop.''</p>
        <p>Goodrich will also have microphones in the pit area at Indianapolis, ''so we'll get the sound of the pneumatic jacks, the coupling of the gas hose,'' he said.</p>
