        <p>A would-be biochemistry major has moved the debate over frog dissection from its familiar high-school forum to the university. Jennifer Routh, a sophomore at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who is considering a career in medicine, is suing the school over the frog dissection requirement in an introductory biology course. Ms. Routh, a vegetarian, also rejected the option of observing a partner's work. The course is a requirement for biology and biochemistry majors. In her suit, Ms. Routh argues that the requirement violates her First Amendment right to exercise her moral and religious beliefs. Ms. Routh's lawyer, Gary Francione, said the lawsuit is the first time a university has been sued over participation in dissection, although many high schools have been successfully sued. Mr. Francione said he hoped the case ''would finally crystalize what is a clear rule of law, that the state can never make a person engage in conduct inimical to religious and moral beliefs under these sorts of circumstances.''
