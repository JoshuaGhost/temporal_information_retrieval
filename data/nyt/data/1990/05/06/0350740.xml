        <p>LEAD: LATELY there is more seafood than ever on the table. The list of fish and shellfish that consumers have come to appreciate has lengthened to include many previously ignored varieties.</p>
        <p>LATELY there is more seafood than ever on the table. The list of fish and shellfish that consumers have come to appreciate has lengthened to include many previously ignored varieties.</p>
        <p>Monkfish, mussels, fresh tuna and squid are now commonplace on restaurant menus and are regularly stocked in fish markets. Now some other kinds of fish are showing up and they deserve attention. Many are relatively inexpensive because heavy demand has yet to drive up the price.</p>
        <p>Blackfish, also called tautog or wrasse, has long been an under-appreciated staple from local waters. It is a mild tasting fish with meaty flesh not unlike that of tilefish. Some classic New England fish stews call for it.</p>
        <p>Skate, long popular in Europe, has acquired a following. Actually, only the fins of the large skate are used, yielding rich, slightly fibrous flesh that has an attractive ribbed pattern to it. Most skate is sold skinned, as boneless fillets, weighing four ounces to two pounds each, depending on the size of the fish. If is has not been filleted there will be two fillets, one on either side of the flat cartilaginous bone and these are easily removed with a knife before cooking. The can be lifted off once they are cooked as well.</p>
        <p>Another fish that has always been fairly abundant but remains under-used is whiting. Whiting tends to be a smaller fish with sweet flesh and is delicious simply sauteed like trout. They are also excellent steamed whole, Chinese style.</p>
        <p>Blackfish Stew</p>
        <p>Preparation time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>Cooking time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped onion</p>
        <p>1 cup finely julienned leeks, white and light-green part only</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, crushed</p>
        <p>1/2 pound potatoes, peeled and sliced thin</p>
        <p>2 cups milk</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>Pinch nutmeg</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds blackfish fillets, in 2-inch chunks</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the oil in a three- to four-quart casserole. Add the onion and saute over medium-low heat until soft but not brown. Stir in the leeks and garlic, saute a minute or two longer, then stir in the potatoes.</p>
        <p>2. Add the milk, bring to a low simmer, cover and cook until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then stir in the nutmeg. The recipe can be prepared up to one hour in advance up to this point.</p>
        <p>3. Reheat the milk and vegetable mixture to a low simmer. Add the fish. Cover and simmer about 10 minutes, just until the fish is cooked through. Re-check seasonings and sprinkle with chives. Serve in soup plates.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings</p>
        <p>Skate With Vinaigrette Of Warm Mustard</p>
        <p>Preparation time: 10 minutes</p>
        <p>Cooking time: 10 minutes</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons red-wine vinegar</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons grainy mustard</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds boneless skate wings in uniform pieces</p>
        <p>1/4 cup flour</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons minced shallots</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Beat the vinegar and mustard together and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Pat the skate wings dry and dust lightly with flour. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the skate wings and saute until lightly browned, about three minutes on each side. Transfer the fish to a platter and set aside, covered loosely with foil.</p>
        <p>4. Add the remaining oil to the skillet. Add the shallots and saute over medium heat until golden. Stir in the reserved vinegar and mustard mixture. Return the fish to the skillet and baste with the sauce. Continue cooking over low heat a few minutes, just long enough to heat the fish through.</p>
        <p>5. Transfer the fish to a serving platter or individual plates, garnish with parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Steamed Whiting With Scallions and Ginger</p>
        <p>Preparation time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>Cooking time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>4 whole whiting, about one pound each, cleaned</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons sesame oil</p>
        <p>1 bunch scallions</p>
        <p>A slice of ginger 1-inch thick, peeled and slivered</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons white soy sauce</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons rice vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. For this recipe you will need a large Chinese steamer basket set over a wok and a heat-proof plate that will hold the fish and can fit into the basket. Otherwise, select a heat-proof plate large enough to hold the fish that can fit into a roasting pan. If necessary, the heads of the fish can be removed so they fit more easily on the platter. Improvise a steamer rack for the roasting pan by removing the tops and bottoms of three cans such as tuna fish cans. Oil the platter with one tablespoon of the sesame oil.</p>
        <p>2. Remove the roots from the scallions, then quarter the scallions lengthwise. Cut them into three-inch lengths.</p>
        <p>3. Scatter half the scallions and half the ginger over the platter. Place the fish on the platter, put some of the scallions inside each fish and scatter the rest over the top.</p>
        <p>4. Bring an inch of water to a boil in the wok or roasting pan. Place platter on the steamer rack or on the cans over the water, cover the steamer or the roasting pan with a cover or with a double thickness of heavy duty foil and steam the fish about 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Carefully remove the platter from the steamer and transfer the fish to a serving platter. Drain all but a few spoonfuls of liquid from the platter, reserving all the scallions and ginger as well. Scrape the reserve cooking juices, the scallions and ginger into a dish, add the soy sauce, vinegar and remaining sesame oil, stir and spoon over the fish. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
