        <p>LEAD: A woman who tried to sell a stolen car radio to people in a Brooklyn restaurant died yesterday morning after a man who was having breakfast there said the radio was his and attacked her with a club, the police said.</p>
        <p>A woman who tried to sell a stolen car radio to people in a Brooklyn restaurant died yesterday morning after a man who was having breakfast there said the radio was his and attacked her with a club, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man fled in his car after he and two other men beat the woman outside Meyer's Restaurant at 1363 Broadway in the Bushwick section, Sgt. Norris Hollomon, a police spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>The woman, in her mid-30s, was found dead on the sidewalk outside. Although several witnesses said the woman collapsed after the beating, she had no visible wounds, and the police did not classify her death a homicide yesterday, pending an autopsy.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Hollomon said witnesses gave the following account: The woman walked into the restaurant with a car radio about 9:45 A.M., trying to sell it. The man jumped up, said it was his and began arguing with her. After checking his car outside, he came back in, announced that his radio had been stolen, and resumed arguing. The dispute spilled into the street, where the man pulled a baseball bat or club from his trunk. Witnesses said two other men joined in the beating. They fled on foot, while the man with the bat escaped in his car.</p>
