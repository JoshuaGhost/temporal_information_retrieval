        <p>LEAD: Jimmy Rodgers, who coached the once-mighty Boston Celtics through two lackluster seasons and two first-round eliminations in post-season play, including Sunday's upset victory by the Knicks in Boston Garden, was dismissed as the team's head coach yesterday.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Rodgers, who coached the once-mighty Boston Celtics through two lackluster seasons and two first-round eliminations in post-season play, including Sunday's upset victory by the Knicks in Boston Garden, was dismissed as the team's head coach yesterday.</p>
        <p>The action by the team's four-man executive committee came just two years after Rodgers's predecessor, K. C. Jones, had stepped aside so his acclaimed long-time assistant could move up to the head coaching position. It also came just two days after the Knicks, refusing to roll over and play dead after trailing the Celtics by two games in the playoffs, completed a rare three-game streak by closing out the Celtics on their home court, the first time in 27 games the Knicks had beaten the Celtics in Boston.</p>
        <p>Despite the timing of the move, Red Auerbach, the former Celtic coach who serves as team president and a member of the executive committee, insisted last night that the dismissal was not based on the loss to the Knicks.</p>
        <p>No Elaboration Given</p>
        <p>''Absolutely not,'' he said. ''I don't blame that game on Rodgers.''</p>
        <p>Auerbach, who attributed Sunday's loss largely to injuries suffered by the Celtic forward Kevin McHale, would not elaborate on the reasons for the dismissal.</p>
        <p>''It was just the consensus of the committee that a change would be in order,'' he said. Without a change, he added, ''we felt the future would just be a repeat of what happened this year.''</p>
        <p>Rodgers's assistant, Lanny Van Eman, was also dismissed, but another assistant, Chris Ford, kept his job and was immediately seen as a likely successor to Rodgers.</p>
        <p>''Chris Ford will be a very serious candidate,'' said Jan Volk, the general manager, who said there was no deadline for naming a new coach.</p>
        <p>Future Role Undecided</p>
        <p>Auerbach said no decision had been made on whether Rodgers, who has three years remaining on his contract, would remain with the Celtic organization. Jones, who stepped aside in 1988 to make room for Rodgers, remained with the Celtics until this season, when he became an assistant with the Seattle SuperSonics.</p>
        <p>When he took over as head coach two years ago after five years as an assistant to Jones, Rodgers, who had also served as the team's director of player personnel, was one of the most heralded assistant coaches in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>In 1985 he was wooed by the Nets for their head coaching position, but withdrew from consideration, saying he didn't want to move his family from Boston.</p>
        <p>Two years later, the Knicks offered him the head coaching position in New York, but the Celtics demanded so much in compensation - a first-round draft selection - that the Knicks balked.</p>
        <p>Stu Jackson, the Knicks' first-year coach whose own job had been considered on the line until the Knicks' stunning, come-from-behind playoff victory over the Celtics, expressed dismay last night.</p>
        <p>''It stinks,'' Jackson said. ''I think everyone in the coaching profession really feels for Jimmy Rodgers. The message it sends to me is that winning 52 games during the regular season doesn't mean a thing.''</p>
        <p>The Celtics, who had a 52-30 record this season, improved significantly over their 42-40 record in Rodgers's first season.</p>
        <p>But the 1988-89 Celtics played all but six games without their injured superstar, Bird. With Bird back this season, there was a feeling among Boston fans and, apparently, the team's management, that Boston should have done far better.</p>
