        <p>LEAD: The last episode of ABC's widely publicized series ''Twin Peaks'' resolved none of its mysteries Wednesday night, including its future ratings prospects, as the May sweep rating month concluded with an unexpected storyline: vulnerability for NBC and viability for CBS.</p>
        <p>The last episode of ABC's widely publicized series ''Twin Peaks'' resolved none of its mysteries Wednesday night, including its future ratings prospects, as the May sweep rating month concluded with an unexpected storyline: vulnerability for NBC and viability for CBS.</p>
        <p>''Twin Peaks'' did achieve its best rating since its third week on the air, a 12.6 with a 22 share of the audience. (Each rating point in the A. C. Nielsen television survey represents 921,000 homes.) But the rating was not nearly as enormous as the publicity surrounding the promise of an answer to the show's central question: Who killed Laura Palmer? And the question wasn't answered, either.</p>
        <p>Fans of ''Twin Peaks,'' still seeking to learn who killed Laura, s who shot Agent Cooper, who clubbed Dr. Jacoby into unconsciousness, who will get out of the burning lumber mill alive, whether Leo and Nadine are really dead, and who fathered Lucy's child, will have to wait until September when the series tries to hold its audience on Saturday night at 10, the least-viewed hour of the week in all of television.</p>
        <p>Last-Place Finish</p>
        <p>The ''Twin Peaks'' phenomenon was not enough to elevate ABC's performance in the sweep rating competition - the network finished last in the closest sweep-month competition in seven years.</p>
        <p>CBS, for three years the last-place network, finally had a positive spin on its rating performance, losing out to the perennial winner, NBC, by just one-tenth of a rating point.</p>
        <p>CBS even protested that margin of loss, pointing to its recent complaints of errors in the Nielsen people-meter rating system. David F. Poltrack, the senior vice president of research for CBS, said the data available from other audience measurements may indicate that CBS beat NBC in the May ratings.</p>
        <p>Officially, however, NBC won the sweep, its 20th sweep victory in the last 21 sweep months, with a 12 rating to 11.9 for CBS and 11.4 for ABC. But NBC was down 18 per cent from last May.</p>
        <p>Significant Erosion</p>
        <p>''The wheels are coming off for NBC,'' Mr. Poltrack said. Among the NBC shows that showed significant erosion, he said, were ''Golden Girls,'' down 17 percent from last May, ''Matlock,'' down 16 percent, and ''Cosby,'' down 11 percent.</p>
        <p>NBC lost most seriously among young women, the audience most sought by advertisers. The network finished third in May among women aged 18 to 49, losing 28 percent of that audience from last year.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 31, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final</p>
        <p>The list of credits with a television review on Friday about ''Twin Peaks'' reversed two names. Ed Hurley is the character played by Everett McGill.</p>
