        <p>LEAD: The financial restructuring proposed by Resorts International Inc. to shed most of its $927 million debt has been approved by committees representing its two groups of bondholders, the casino company said today.</p>
        <p>The financial restructuring proposed by Resorts International Inc. to shed most of its $927 million debt has been approved by committees representing its two groups of bondholders, the casino company said today.</p>
        <p>The plan must still be approved by two-thirds of the bondholders, the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Camden, N.J., the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the Government of the Bahamas. Besides Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, Resorts owns casinos in the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>The endorsement of the recapitalization plan comes just before a bankruptcy court hearing on the plan scheduled for next Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I am pleased that the bondholder committees have endorsed our plan,'' said the Merv Griffin, the entertainer who is Resorts's chairman.</p>
        <p>''Now, we will focus our attention on making Resorts the world-class resort it can be.''</p>
        <p>The plan, filed under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, would give bondholders 78 percent of the company, dropping Mr. Griffin's holdings to 22 percent, from 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Resorts would then exchange the $927 million in debt held by those bondholders for a reduced debt service.</p>
