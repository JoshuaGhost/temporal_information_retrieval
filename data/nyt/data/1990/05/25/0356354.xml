        <p>In an attempt to revive stalemated talks on expanding air travel between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Soviets requested today that the negotiations be resumed in Washington this weekend, American officials said.</p>
        <p>American officials had said previously that the talks had broken down over economic issues, apparently dashing earlier hopes that an agreement would be signed during the summit meeting that begins next week between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>A cable to the State Department today from the Soviets said they would be willing to present a new offer in talks on Sunday and Monday, American officials said.</p>
        <p>If an agreement is reached, it would permit several airlines to offer flights between more than a dozen cities in the two nations. Flights are now limited to Pan Am and Aeroflot, which serve only the cities of Moscow, Leningrad, Washington and New York.</p>
