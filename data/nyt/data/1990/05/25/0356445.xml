        <p>Girard Parnters L.P., the investment group seeking to gain control of the board of the Pic 'N' Save Corporation, said that if its nominees are elected they would create an advisory committee of representatives of institutional shareholders to recommend how to sell the company.</p>
        <p>Girard, which is led by David H. Batchelder, a former chief strategist for T. Boone Pickens, has said that if it gains control it will try to buy all the company or sell it. Pic 'N' Save's management has put the company up for auction. So far, Girard and the company have not reached an agreement about including Girard in the process.</p>
