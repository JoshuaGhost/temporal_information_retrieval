        <p>LEAD: Pepsico Inc. said yesterday that its profits rose by 10.2 percent in the first quarter, led by strong returns in its domestic soft-drink and worldwide restaurant operations.</p>
        <p>Pepsico Inc. said yesterday that its profits rose by 10.2 percent in the first quarter, led by strong returns in its domestic soft-drink and worldwide restaurant operations.</p>
        <p>Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., said it earned $181.9 million, or 68 cents a share in the three months that ended on March 24, compared with $165.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Its revenues rose by 24.4 percent, to $3.67 billion from $2.95 billion.</p>
        <p>The company's stock rose $1.75 yesterday, to $66.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Pepsico's operating earnings rose by 26 percent, fueled by strong volume growth in the soft-drink, restaurant and snack-foods operations.</p>
        <p>In soft drinks, operating profits rose by 27 percent, to $151.5 million, as sales increased by 25 percent, to $1.3 billion. Excluding acquisitions, Pepsico's sales were up by 8 percent and operating profits jumped by 24 percent.</p>
        <p>Soft-Drink Profits Up</p>
        <p>The company's American soft-drink profits rose by 32 percent, on an 8 percent sales gain. International profits fell in comparison with strong results in the 1989 period.</p>
        <p>Pepsico's operating profits from snack foods rose by 20 percent, to $186.4 million, as sales rose by 27 percent, to $1.1 billion.</p>
        <p>Higher advertising and marketing expenses, costs of introducing new products and a shift in the sales mix to lower-margin products led to slower growth in Pepsico's domestic snack-foods operations, although volume sales rose by 6 percent.</p>
        <p>The company's worldwide restaurant earnings rose by 39 percent, to $91 million, on a 22 percent sales increase, to $1.3 billion.</p>
