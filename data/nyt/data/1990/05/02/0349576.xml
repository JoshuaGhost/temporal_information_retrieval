        <p>LEAD: The CBS television network affiliate in Los Angeles, KCBS, announced yesterday that it had agreed to broadcast a debate between the contenders for the Democratic nomination for governor of California, Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp, on Sunday afternoon, May 20.</p>
        <p>The CBS television network affiliate in Los Angeles, KCBS, announced yesterday that it had agreed to broadcast a debate between the contenders for the Democratic nomination for governor of California, Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp, on Sunday afternoon, May 20.</p>
        <p>Officials of the two campaigns characterized the station's announcement as a reversal of an earlier refusal to broadcast a debate during the May rating period, when the size of a station's audience is measured.</p>
        <p>KCBS notified the campaigns of its new position on Sunday, campaign officials said, after The New York Times reported that the station had refused to broadcast the debate at the time the campaigns had agreed on, Monday evening, May 21.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials said Michael Singer, the KCBS news director, had told them originally that he would not broadcast a debate during the May rating period and had instead offered times for the debate during and after the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>But in announcing that the station would broadcast a debate during the ''sweeps'' rating period, Mr. Singer said yesterday that the campaigns had misunderstood his position. He said that the station had been ''negotiating'' with the campaigns and that other issues like conflicts with other already scheduled broadcasts had delayed an agreeement.</p>
