        <p>LEAD: After living together for 15 years, CLAIRE BLOOM and PHILIP ROTH were married on Sunday at the Manhattan home of BARBARA EPSTEIN, a co-editor of The New York Review of Books. ''We just thought it was about time,'' Miss Bloom said.</p>
        <p>After living together for 15 years, CLAIRE BLOOM and PHILIP ROTH were married on Sunday at the Manhattan home of BARBARA EPSTEIN, a co-editor of The New York Review of Books. ''We just thought it was about time,'' Miss Bloom said.</p>
        <p>The 59-year old actress and the writer, who is 57, will continue to divide their time among Manhattan, London and an 18th-century house in Connecticut, Miss Bloom said, and they will continue their busy and separate careers.</p>
        <p>Miss Bloom has been married twice before, and Mr. Roth once. Judge SHIRLEY FINGERHOOD of New York City Civil Court in Manhattan, an old friend of Miss Bloom, officiated.</p>
        <p>Last night, Miss Bloom appeared at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to read from, and participate in a discussion of, two Virginia Woolf novels as part of a series, ''The Feminist and the Novelist.'' Mr. Roth did not attend, Miss Bloom said, adding, ''He's heard me read before.''</p>
