        <p>LEAD: Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable television company, said yesterday that it was again altering the form of its planned spinoff of assets. Under the new plan, Tele-Communications said it would spin off part of its assets into a separate business.</p>
        <p>Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable television company, said yesterday that it was again altering the form of its planned spinoff of assets. Under the new plan, Tele-Communications said it would spin off part of its assets into a separate business.</p>
        <p>At an analysts' meeting at the cable television industry convention in Atlanta, John C. Malone, the president of Tele-Communications, said that assets representing about 10 percent of the company's value would be part of the new business, and that the plan might take effect next fall.</p>
        <p>He said the company would not put its ownership of Storer Communications Inc., the cable television company it owns with the Comcast Corporation, into the venture.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said yesterday that the structure of the new deal would be determined by the outcome of the re-regulation issues that were being debated in Washington.</p>
        <p>The company had announced a spinoff in January in a move to increase its stock price and fend off any criticism by Washington of its perceived leverage in the cable business.</p>
        <p>Initially, Tele-Communications, based in Denver, said it would spin off many of its programming operations, including its 22 percent stake in the Turner Broadcasting System, and other businesses in which it had only partial interests. That included some cable television programming assets.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts then valued Tele-Communications' assets at about $13 billion, and the company said it was planning to spin off about $3 billion in assets. It revised the decision and said that not only would it restructure the deal, but that it would also keep its Turner stake as part of the main company.</p>
