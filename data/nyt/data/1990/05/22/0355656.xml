        <p>LEAD: Watching Mark Messier play through a minor slump is like living on a fault line. Things may seem still and quiet for a stretch, but, sooner or later, everything will start to rumble and shake.</p>
        <p>Watching Mark Messier play through a minor slump is like living on a fault line. Things may seem still and quiet for a stretch, but, sooner or later, everything will start to rumble and shake.</p>
        <p>Messier, the captain of the Edmonton Oilers, has but one assist in the first three games of the Stanley Cup finals. His Oilers lead the Boston Bruins, two games to one, in the four-of-seven game championship, which resumes Tuesday night here at Northlands Coliseum.</p>
        <p>Among the theories for Messier's slump are that Bobby Carpenter of the Bruins has been checking him well and that Messier is hiding an injury.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Messier's 100 percent healthy,'' said Mike Milbury, the coach of the Bruins.</p>
        <p>''I feel fine,'' said Messier. ''There are no injuries.''</p>
        <p>When asked specifically if he had a rib injury, Messier said, ''I have no comment.''</p>
        <p>John Muckler, the Oilers' coach, said today: ''He's in A-1 shape. I don't think he's played up to his capabilities. That's when you have to start worrying about Mark Messier. He'll pop up and have an awesome game.''</p>
        <p>Such a thing happened in the fourth game of the previous round against Chicago. The Oilers trailed, two games to one, until Messier scored two goals and added two assists to lead them to a victory. They won the next two to clinch the series and took the first two at Boston before losing, 2-1, here on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Wary Interviews</p>
        <p>Ask for an interview with Peter Pocklington, owner of the Edmonton Oilers, and you get a very official denial from one of his top aides, Bill Tuele, public relations director for both the Oilers and for Pocklington. Tuele admits that he is afraid of what Pocklington will say.</p>
        <p>Ever since Pocklington traded Wayne Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in the summer of 1988, he has been villified in this city, a place where a statue of Gretzky was erected last season outside Northlands Coliseum.</p>
        <p>But Pocklington, loose cannon that he is, shows up in the Oiler locker room from time to time, usually after victories. When the Oilers won Game 2 in Boston Friday night, Pocklington told Terry Jones of The Edmonton Sun of the reaction to The Trade:</p>
        <p>''Everybody jumped on me as if the end of the world had come. People boycotted my dairy and threw eggs at my house. I was shot at a couple of times.</p>
        <p>''I had over 100 death threats. People took it pretty seriously. Wayne was an icon. Not a hockey player or even a hero, but an icon. When you trade away an icon like Gretzky in a city that loves its sport, you are literally taking your life in your hands. It's been safe for me to walk the streets again since the L.A. series.'' The Oilers swept Gretzky's Kings in the second round.</p>
        <p>Tuele didn't deny any of Pocklington's published remarks, but was most chagrined about his statements regarding Jari Kurri, who turned 30 last week and is at the end of a contract. ''A lot of heat is going to be on me to make sure Jari stays,'' Pocklington said. ''It'll be up to Jari. We know we can afford to pay him.'' But he added that he didn't wish to lose his head in bidding for the star sniper from Finland.</p>
        <p>''This is too much of a sport to be a business sometimes,'' Pocklington said, ''and too much of a business to be a sport at other times.''</p>
        <p>Day-Dreamer's Goal</p>
        <p>John Byce, the Boston rookie, said he had a premonition that he might score an easy goal Sunday. Byce, who played most of the season with the University of Wisconsin, scored 10 seconds after the opening faceoff to give Boston a lead it never lost.</p>
        <p>''I was sort of day-dreaming before the game,'' said Byce. ''Something came to mind. An easy opportunity. I didn't know exactly how it would happen.''</p>
        <p>It happened on a rebound of a shot by Cam Neely. Byce, playing in place of Dave Poulin, was centering with Neely and Craig Janney, who moved from center to left wing. Poulin had an injured knee.</p>
        <p>Byce, who grew up in Madison, Wis., scored three goals in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game this spring, a victory over Colgate.</p>
        <p>Which playoffs have more pressure, the N.C.A.A. or the Stanley Cup?</p>
        <p>''I felt a little more pressure at the N.C.A.A.,'' Byce said. ''I was expected to do so much.''</p>
        <p>Fighters Take Break</p>
        <p>Once again, the two teams played a game without fighting. There hasn't been a fighting penalty in the series. There have been few fights in the entire Stanley Cup tournament, which has lasted almost two months. What's going on here? ''It may be something you see a lot more of,'' Glen Sather, president and general manager of the Oilers, said about the decline in fisticuffs. ''In a lot of instances, it is a waste of time.''</p>
        <p>In the playoffs, Sather said, ''The games are so close and so important you can't take a chance of a guy being penalized as an instigator.''  NOTEBOOK</p>
