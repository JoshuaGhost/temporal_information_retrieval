        <p>LEAD: Fieldy, a tough 7-year-old mare who has raced all over the country, circled a small field and scored a 1 1/4-length victory yesterday in the $87,900 Beaugay Handicap at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Fieldy, a tough 7-year-old mare who has raced all over the country, circled a small field and scored a 1 1/4-length victory yesterday in the $87,900 Beaugay Handicap at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>The daughter of Northfields and Grammy, who has raced at eight different tracks in her last 11 starts, paid $4.40 for $2 to win as the favorite, and covered the mile and a sixteenth on a soft inner turf course in 1 minute 46.92 seconds under Craig Perret. She carried top weight of 119 pounds, five more than Summer Secretary, last year's Beaugay winner, who held second by six lengths over Lady Talc. Gather the Clan was fourth with Lost in Flight the trailer in a field reduced to five by the late scratches of Maison Close, Windy Surf, Buy the Firm and Channel Flipper.</p>
        <p>Fieldy, who has won 15 of 47 career starts and earned $887,655, made her last two starts against tougher fields at Santa Anita, where her late rallies fell just a bit short. Before that trip to California, she had raced in Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Canada, all within the last year.</p>
        <p>''This is a great little filly,'' said Tom Skiffington, who trains Fieldy for the Fernwood Stable. ''I think she's my favorite of all the horses I've trained. Every time you run her, she gives you everything she's got.''</p>
        <p>Lost in Flight set the early pace of 26.14 and 51.22 before Summer Secretary took over through six furlongs in 1:16.05. Fieldy, who trailed for seven furlongs, swung to the outside and caught Summer Secretary just inside the furlong pole.</p>
