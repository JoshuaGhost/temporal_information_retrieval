        <p>LEAD: The Texas oilman and investor T. Boone Pickens has accused the Toyota Motor Corporation of blocking him from placing advertisements in Japanese newspapers in his bid to assert ownership rights in a Japanese company.</p>
        <p>The Texas oilman and investor T. Boone Pickens has accused the Toyota Motor Corporation of blocking him from placing advertisements in Japanese newspapers in his bid to assert ownership rights in a Japanese company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickens said Thursday that he had filed a complaint against Toyota before the Japan Fair Trade Commission, contending that the company had put pressure on Japan's biggest national newspapers to prevent them from publishing the ads.</p>
        <p>Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker, has ties with the Koito Manufacturing Company, a Tokyo-based automobile parts supplier in which Mr. Pickens is the largest shareholder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pickens said the ads were to have been an attempt to communicate directly with the Japanese people. He said he wanted to point out ''anti-competitive practices by Toyota's keiretsus, or cartel systems.''</p>
        <p>The ads had been partly paid for and scheduled for publication this week, when Mr. Pickens learned that Japan's leading newspapers had changed their minds about running them. The text asked Japanese consumers with any information about unfair trade practices at Toyota or other Japanese companies to send it to Mr. Pickens in Dallas.</p>
