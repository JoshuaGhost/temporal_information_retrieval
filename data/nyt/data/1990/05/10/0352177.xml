        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With regard to Leopold Bellak's article ''Why I Fear the Germans'' (Op-Ed, April 25):</p>
        <p>For five years I was a public school teacher at the junior high level in California during which time I had daily playground duty during the recess periods. The purpose of that duty was to break up and to prevent the numerous acts of aggression that occurred between the children on the playground, as well as to prevent children from ''escaping'' from the playground itself.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bellak said his observers noted 258 acts of aggression against other children on German playgrounds during the period of observation. Certainly I noted hundreds if not thousands of aggressive acts between children during my years as a public school teacher. And, of course, there was the incident last year in Stockton, Calif., where an adult committed an aggressive act against playground children by shooting them with an automatic weapon.</p>
        <p>If violent acts between children and violent acts against children by adults is a basis for fearing the political power of a nation, then I am just as concerned about the role of the United States in the international community as Dr. Bellak is concerned about the role of a united Germany.</p>
