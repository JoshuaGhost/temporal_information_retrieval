        <p>LEAD: A bomb planted near a restaurant on a busy market street in the Jewish sector of Jerusalem exploded today, killing a 72-year-old man and wounding nine others, including a 6-year-old boy.</p>
        <p>A bomb planted near a restaurant on a busy market street in the Jewish sector of Jerusalem exploded today, killing a 72-year-old man and wounding nine others, including a 6-year-old boy.</p>
        <p>Three of the wounded were listed in serious condition.</p>
        <p>The police, who described the noontime explosion as a ''terrorist attack,'' rounded up dozens of Palestinians as a crowd of angry and frightened shoppers spat on them and tried to attack them shouting, ''Death to the Arabs!''</p>
        <p>Israeli television said a Palestinian guerrilla organization called Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the bombing tonight.</p>
        <p>Israeli policemen were posted tonight in large numbers throughout the city. The police identified the dead man as Shimon Cohen.</p>
        <p>Many Holiday Shoppers</p>
        <p>A number of Arabs work as laborers in the open-stall market, which is often full of shoppers, especially in midday and on the eve of holidays. Many people said they were there to shop for the Jewish holiday of Shavuoth starting Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A bomb was detonated by policemen today in a bus station in the town of Rishon le Zion, where a gunman said by the Israeli authorities to be mentally unstable had lined up seven Palestinians and shot them dead eight days ago.</p>
        <p>The bombing in Jerusalem today occurred as tensions between Arabs and Jews were running high here after a week of clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli Army set off by the Rishon le Zion killings.</p>
        <p>At least 17 Palestinians have been shot dead and nearly 900 wounded in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in riots protesting the May 20 killings.</p>
        <p>Most of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip have been shut down by a curfew since last Sunday.</p>
        <p>Arab Leaders Meeting</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli official, Yossi Ben-Aharon, director of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office, linked the bombing to the meeting of Arab leaders that opened today in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben-Aharon asserted that Palestinian groups that he said ''compete among themselves to achieve their goals at our expense'' were responsible for the bombing.</p>
        <p>The explosion was the first fatal terrorist attack against Israeli Jews in West Jerusalem since last May, when a Palestinian wielding a knife killed two Israelis on the city's main shopping street.</p>
        <p>There had been no bomb explosions in Jerusalem for a number of years, but the Mehani Yehuda market is remembered here as the first target of a terrorist bombing after the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank and annexed predominantly Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In 1968 a car bomb killed 10 Israelis in the market.</p>
        <p>This morning a gasoline bomb was thrown at a car carrying a senior police officer in East Jerusalem, but it did not ignite.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night Hezi Ben Yosef, an Israeli Jew driving through an Arab neighborhood of Lod, near Ben-Gurion Airport, was assaulted by men who stoned his car, then dragged him out and severely beat him after he pulled up trying to shoot at his attackers.</p>
        <p>The Arab journalist association's chairman, Radwan Abu Ayash, said, ''We don't want to see any innocent person killed, but it is impossible to stop the killing if the Israeli Government continues its extremism.''</p>
        <p>Palestinians said they were sure that tensions would rise further, because Israel's High Court gave permission today to the far-right Kach organization led by Rabbi Meir Kahane to hold a demonstration in Rishon le Zion. Kach said the demonstration was in support of the 21-year-old man who shot the Palestinians on May 20.</p>
