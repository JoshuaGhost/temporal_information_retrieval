        <p>Harry Bachrach, the president of Harry Bachrach Inc., a Manhattan textile company specializing in neckties, died of heart disease on Friday at New Rochelle Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bachrach was born on July 1, 1910, in Vienna, where he managed a family textile business from the age of 19. After the Nazi occupation in 1938, he spirited six Jewish relatives and friends to safety in London and came to this country, where faulty vision barred him from military service.</p>
        <p>In 1976, after retiring, he enrolled as a freshman at Iona College and made the dean's honor list, but was unable to continue because of illnesses. In 1980, he was elected Man of the Year by the Men's Neckwear Foundation.</p>
        <p>Surviving are his wife, Katharine; two sons, Alfred, of Pittsfield, Me., and George, of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Frances Shifman, of Newton, Mass., and five grandchildren.</p>
