        <p>LEAD: And now the great delusion is being played out here, the Soviet and American actors walking about and reciting their lines, hoping that the world believes the play is reality.</p>
        <p>And now the great delusion is being played out here, the Soviet and American actors walking about and reciting their lines, hoping that the world believes the play is reality.</p>
        <p>That is what the summit meeting is becoming, a stage where a fantasy is being acted out - somehow, the United States, if only it wished, could save Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union from the consequences of 70 years of Soviet Communist economic corruption, political despotism, imperialism abroad and colonialism at home.</p>
        <p>We are all entitled to fantasies but not when others suffer from them. The victims this time will be the Soviet people if they take fantasy for truth.</p>
        <p>The fantasy obscures the fact that only the Soviet people can save their country, and so it delays their self-rescue. It is not just a delusion that is being acted out, but a cruel one.</p>
        <p>At a Washington news conference held by Soviet economists, journalists and propagandists, an American woman listens to an hour of talk about nuclear arms control, Germany, the shape of the new Europe, and then gets up to say that is all very well, but what plans does the Soviet leadership have to get food on Moscow's empty shelves?</p>
        <p>For an answer she gets a sneer from Georgi Arbatov, who has sneered for all Soviet Governments for decades - what answers does the lady have herself?</p>
        <p>In Moscow a shopper is asked by American TV what she hopes will come out of the summit meeting from America. The United States should send some fruit, she says.</p>
        <p>Not all the oranges in Florida and all the wheat in Kansas will fill Soviet shelves for more than a few days. It is not food that the Soviet Union needs, but a system that would encourage farmers to grow it, teach consumers to expect to pay reasonably for it and help shoppers conquer their entirely reasonable fear that anything on the shelves will be gone tomorrow so hoard today, for survival's sake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev comes to Washington at a time when perestroika's failure has not only slashed his personal stature but deprived his Government of writ or mandate - which means power to govern - in many parts of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The United States cannot patch up the Soviet economy because it is not a leaking tire, it is a blowout. Anyway, our current and past Administrations have left us at the point where we cannot even rescue Panama.</p>
        <p>President Gorbachev might have saved the Soviet Union from economic disaster. His first step had to be scrapping the Communist political and economic system altogether.</p>
        <p>The confusion he has created in his country - one step forward by encouraging talk about a free economy, two steps back by insisting he is a Communist and showing it with economic half-measures - has made it too late for the Soviet Union to avoid the avalanche.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Soviet economists play their part in the cruel delusion by asking for long-term American credits to help the Kremlin. At the same time, they barely conceal their contempt for Mr. Gorbachev and his ideological hesitations.</p>
        <p>They do not seem to see the contradiction between saying the past five years have been a failure and asking for long-term credits for the same management. Or maybe they figure this country is dotty about Mr. Gorbachev so they might as well take advantage of it while they can for the Soviet Government.</p>
        <p>Which Government and what kind? Boris Yeltsin's victory shows that in the Russian heartland as in the colonized republics there is an unstoppable drive for freedom from Moscow's domination. Mr. Gorbachev is not the first Soviet President but he could be the last.</p>
        <p>One fear keeps alive in the West the desire to save the Moscow regime: After Gorbachev, Fascism. Soviet hate peddlers are crawling from under the rocks where Soviet Governments allowed them to breed. Mr. Gorbachev appointed one, Valentin Rasputin, to his presidential council.</p>
        <p>But more leaders of an anti-Fascist, anti-Communist, pro-democracy movement are emerging. They are more likely to follow Mr. Gorbachev than some of the rightist zealots with whom he likes to flirt.</p>
        <p>In any case, the Soviet people will determine whether their future leads to more tyranny or liberty.</p>
        <p>But to commit American strength to Mr. Gorbachev could foreclose the future on his democratic opponents, the legitimate inheritors of the new Soviet revolution. In them rests the hope that the chaos created by Communism will not lead to another tyranny but to full liberty, at last.</p>
