        <p>LEAD: Edward Louie, creator of the fortune cookie folding machine and a line of risque fortune cookies, died on Friday shortly after returning from a visit to his ancestral village in China. He was 69 years old.</p>
        <p>Edward Louie, creator of the fortune cookie folding machine and a line of risque fortune cookies, died on Friday shortly after returning from a visit to his ancestral village in China. He was 69 years old.</p>
        <p>Mr. Louie opened the Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in San Francisco in 1946. The entire Louie family worked there, flipping and folding thousands of cookies a day with chopsticks until Mr. Louie invented the folding machine in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>The machine inserts paper fortunes into the cookies as they are folded. The original machine is still operating today, helping with the company's daily output of 90,000 cookies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Louie also gained notice for his giant fortune cookies, which are six inches wide and are sometimes filled with money or jewels, and for cookies containing suggestive fortunes and jokes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Louie, who retired three years ago, is survived by his wife, Florence; three sons, Gregory, Clarence and Paul, all of San Francisco; three grandchildren, three brothers and three sisters.</p>
