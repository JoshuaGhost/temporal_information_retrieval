        <p>LEAD: When the Soviet advance team was here a couple of weeks ago, scarfing down dozens of hot dogs and savoring fifths of Jack Daniels at a Washington Capitals hockey game, it all looked so easy.</p>
        <p>When the Soviet advance team was here a couple of weeks ago, scarfing down dozens of hot dogs and savoring fifths of Jack Daniels at a Washington Capitals hockey game, it all looked so easy.</p>
        <p>They told the White House officials who treated them to the hockey game that they did not need any help planning President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's trip across the country. The Soviet advance team, filled with former K.G.B. agents who put a higher premium on security than imagery, did not even bother to tell Bush officials more than the barest essentials of the Soviet President's schedule in Minneapolis and San Francisco.</p>
        <p>But suddenly this week, realizing that they did not know as much about camera angles, lighting, sound bites and satellite uplink as they might, the Soviet camp apparently got jittery. Faced with the specter of chaos as Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, traveled across the United States totally on their own and at the mercy of hordes of predatory reporters and glad-handing pols, the Soviets asked for help.</p>
        <p>Now the Gorbachevs will travel on their Aeroflot plane shepherded by Sig Rogich, the former Las Vegas advertising and public relations man who has been polishing President Bush's image for the last eight months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogich immediately swung into action, putting advance teams on the ground in Minneapolis and San Francisco and arranging for the Gorbachevs to take a tour of the Twin Cities on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The White House also tossed in a political fillip: To counteract the big boost that the Soviet leader's visit is giving to Gov. Rudy Perpich, the Democrat who is trailing in his re-election bid, Bush officials invited the two Republican Senators from Minnesota, Rudy Boschwitz and Dave Durenberger, to fly along on Aeroflot from Washington.</p>
        <p>At least, Democratic pundits noted, Mr. Rogich would not have to worry about giving this President ''a vision thing.''</p>
        <p>'The Stare' Is Prepared</p>
        <p>Raisa Gorbachev kept a low profile on her Canadian trip, staying close to her husband and making fewer wardrobe changes than she usually does.</p>
        <p>But even before Mrs. Gorbachev decided to go with an understated style, perhaps to quell criticism at home that she is too flashy and forward, White House officials were noting with satisfaction that her novelty value had worn thin for Americans.</p>
        <p>There is great confidence in the Bush Administration that Barbara Bush will never let Raisa Gorbachev get under her skin, no matter how much the strong-willed Soviet First Lady expounds on Marxist-Leninist doctrine.</p>
        <p>Nancy Reagan was always getting infuriated by such lectures. ''Who does that dame think she is?'' Mrs. Reagan demanded after one such encounter at a White House dinner, Donald Regan, President Reagan's chief of staff, reported.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush has a different technique, however, known around the White House as ''the stare.'' When someone says something that bothers her, she offers a look of Greenwich granite that shows she is not one to be trifled with or underestimated.</p>
        <p>She swiftly set the tone with Mrs. Gorbachev during the last summit meeting in Washington in 1987. Mrs. Gorbachev had been told by her staff that Vice President Bush's wife was a snowy-haired homemaker type, far different from Nancy Reagan, the glittering clotheshorse.</p>
        <p>So when they met, Mrs. Gorbachev offered to share a recipe for her favorite blueberry dessert. Mrs. Bush offered The Stare.</p>
        <p>''Raisa, do you cook at home?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gorbachev replied tentatively, ''Well, sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush said, ''Well, I never cook at home, so let's talk about something else.''</p>
        <p>The two moved out of the kitchen and into a discussion about education.</p>
        <p>Party Chief Gets a Wish</p>
        <p>At 3 o'clock this afternoon, Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic Party, sat in his office talking about how he would like to visit the Soviet Union. Wasn't he going to meet with Mr. Gorbachev, just one party chairman to another?</p>
        <p>''I haven't been invited,'' Mr. Brown said wistfully.</p>
        <p>But by 5 o'clock, Coretta Scott King had called to ask if Mr. Brown would accompany her to the Soviet Embassy on Friday afternoon to present Mr. Gorbachev the Martin Luther King Jr. Peace Award.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how much time there would be for Mr. Brown to compare party notes with Mr. Gorbachev. The Soviet leader will have to give a speech at the event, sponsored by Friends World College, a small Quaker-founded institution in Glen Cove, L.I., and he will receive a statue of silver and bronze fashioned by a Mexican artist.</p>
        <p>''It is a dove embracing the globe in his wings,'' said Hans Janitschek, a college trustee. ''Oh, I don't have to tell you how very beautiful it is.''</p>
        <p>Spring Fever, That's All</p>
        <p>It was a glorious spring day in Washington, but no one seemed to be electrified by summit fever.</p>
        <p>''The summit has produced a lull,'' a top White House official said as he waited not-so-anxiously for the Gorbachevs to arrive. ''Things here are kind of slow.''</p>
        <p>There was a paucity of souvenir vendors downtown, and T-shirts of the nasty cartoon family ''The Simpsons'' were doing a brisker business than the Gorbachev T-shirts that Misha Knight was selling in Lafayette Park across from the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight, who said he moved to the United States in 1978 because he saw no future in the Soviet Union, kept himself busy by singing his new composition, ''I Am a Gorby Man.''</p>
        <p>The normal crowd of demonstrators in the park - ''Respect Life,'' ''Enter the Aquarian Age - Space is for Deadheads, Not Warheads,'' - acquired a few new sign-bearers. ''President Bush, Don't Sell Lithuania,'' one sign declared.</p>
        <p>Just the Usual Pomp</p>
        <p>This is the first time a summit meeting has fallen under the rubric of state visit because this is the first time Mr. Gorbachev has come as President of his country.</p>
        <p>''He will get no more and no less than the President of Togo and the President of France,'' said Joseph Reed, the State Department's protocol chief. ''There is a very specific architecture for visiting heads of state, and the blueprints do not waver.''</p>
        <p>That blueprint specifies that toasts at the state dinner will not be translated.</p>
        <p>Bush aides said that President Bush's gifts to Mr. Gorbachev would be a rare first edition of Chief Justice John Marshall's biography of George Washington, along with a colored map of Mount Vernon.</p>
