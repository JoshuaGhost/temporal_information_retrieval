        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The May 5 letter on Jerusalem by the press secretary of the Crown Prince of Jordan indicates that either the Crown Prince has a short memory, or else that he assumes his readers are ignorant of recent history.</p>
        <p>The Old City of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan for 19 years. During this time, not one Jew was allowed to reach the Western Wall, the holiest place of worship in the Jewish religion. At the same time, Jordan destroyed systematically each and every synagogue in the city. The Jordanians also desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives, by removing tombstones and using them to pave the military latrines nearby. I myself witnessed these sad sights after Jerusalem was liberated in 1967.</p>
        <p>Yet the Crown Prince makes himself out to be the champion of the right to ''unhindered access to holy places in Jerusalem.'' In the process, he accuses Israel of inflicting ''damage and destruction'' on Muslim and Christian sanctuaries.</p>
        <p>The facts, however, are that Israel has an impeccable record of respecting all places of worship, and has meticulously protected churches and mosques alike. Never has the freedom of worship been so firmly practiced as under Israel.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the Jewish ties to Jerusalem, it is important to remember that these ties were established 3,000 years ago, when King David made it the eternal Jewish capital. Christianity started 1,200 years later and Islam, 1,600 years later.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem, with its citadel Zion, is mentioned almost 1,000 times in the Hebrew Bible, but not a single time in the Koran. Mohammed issued a prohbition on Feb. 11, 624, against turning to Jerusalem in prayer; all prayers had to be said facing Mecca, the only recognized religious center.</p>
        <p>It is also interesting to note that the modern Arabic name for Jerusalem, El-Kuds, refers to the Jewish Temple of King Solomon. Similarly, Christian affinity to Jerusalem is based on the Jewish Temple in the days of Jesus.</p>
        <p>All considered, it is not surprising that only Jews have been saying for centuries: ''Next year in Jerusalem.''</p>
