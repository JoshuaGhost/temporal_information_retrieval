        <p>LEAD: As the Senate prepares to debate the way Senate campaigns are financed and run, Democrats today proposed a package of measures that included voluntary spending limits, partial public financing and a ban on direct contributions to candidates by political action committees.</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about a Democratic proposal to change the financing of political campaigns overstated contributions that five Senators received from Charles H. Keating Jr. Mr. Keating gave more than $1 million altogether to their re-election campaigns.</p>
        <p>As the Senate prepares to debate the way Senate campaigns are financed and run, Democrats today proposed a package of measures that included voluntary spending limits, partial public financing and a ban on direct contributions to candidates by political action committees.</p>
        <p>''The system by which American campaigns are financed is out of control and getting worse,'' said Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, a prime sponsor of the proposal. Mr. Mitchell added: ''It does not serve our nation's best interest. It must be changed.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic proposal sets the stage for a debate over issues including public financing, spending limits and the role of political action committees and unions in campaigns. It also opens the way for negotiations, expected to be protracted, over the scale of the overhaul of campaign finance when the Senate begins considering the issue, probably within the next week.</p>
        <p>G.O.P.'s Version</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Senate Republicans offered their own campaign finance proposal as an alternative to the Democratic package. The G.O.P. proposal included elimination of political action committees and a bar on political activity by any tax-exempt organization. The bill, sponsored by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, seemed to be an attempt to commit the G.O.P. to campaign finance revision as pressure from the public increased on Congress to deal with election spending.</p>
        <p>''With both these bills laid down, we are at the stage where we have serious negotiatons or no reform at all in this Congress,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a watchdog group that has pressed to overhaul Federal election campaigns. The central features of the Democrats' bill - spending limits and public support of campaigns - are anathema to many Republicans, who say challengers would be at a disadvantage because they must spend large amounts of money to become as well known as incumbents. Limits on the amounts that candidates spend, many Republicans say, favor Congressional incumbents, many of whom are Democats.</p>
        <p>Change in Climate</p>
        <p>Two years ago a Democratic bill that included ceilings on spending, as well as public financing was blocked by a Republican-led filibuster. By reviving these two legislative themes, Democrats are essentially signaling their belief that the political climate has been sufficiently changed by the savings and loan scandal. Five senators are under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for allegedly blocking a Federal investigation of Lincoln Savings and Loan, whose president, Charles H. Keating Jr., contributed more than $5 million to aid the lawmakers' re-election campaigns. The savings and loan affair has deeply embarrassed many lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Asked why he thought the Senate would accept spending ceilings and a Federal subsidy of campaigns now, when it refused to do so in 1988, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware uttered three words: ''savings and loan.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic bill offers inducements, like discounts on rates for television and radio commercials and for mailings, to candidates who agree to spending limits for the general election. The limits would range from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on the state. A candidate who raises 10 percent of funds allowed under the state ceiling through private donations of less than $250 each would receive a Federal subsidy amounting to 70 percent of the state limit.</p>
        <p>In addition, a candidate would get vouchers that could be used to buy television time as long as the commercials are between one and five minutes long. This is an effort to reduce the reliance on 30-second negative commercials.</p>
        <p>The measure also allows candidates to raise money through single contributions of $100 or less from individuals within their states up to a level of 25 percent of their state's spending ceiling. It also places limits on the amount individuals can give to state parties for activities like voter registration drives that might benefit a candidate for Federal office.</p>
