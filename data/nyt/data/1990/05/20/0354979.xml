        <p>By Nat Brandt.</p>

        <p>Anyone who has attended Oberlin College in Ohio in the last 130 years or so knows of the 1858 Oberlin-Wellington Rescue. It dominates the lore of that yeasty place. I first heard of the rescue from a professor there, Robert S. Fletcher, who was the historian of the college and loved to tell the tale. Fletcher would have loved ''The Town That Started the Civil War,'' the first full-length account of the rescue to be written since 1859. Nat Brandt has a good story to tell, and he tells it very well.</p>
        <p>The book's title, it must be said, is hyperbole (Mr. Brandt likes eye-catching titles, having written ''The Man Who Tried to Burn New York,'' about a Civil War arson plot), but once past the title page, the reader can settle into a solid, well-written narrative that is based on expert and wide-ranging research.</p>
        <p>It is quickly apparent that the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue was an incident waiting to happen. Students at Oberlin, Mr. Brandt explains, were dedicated to saving the world through teaching, preaching, missionary work or whatever else it took. ''Oberlin is peculiar in that which is good,'' one of its founders boasted.</p>
        <p>In 1858 Oberlin was perhaps the most integrated community in America. A fifth of its people were blacks - freeborn or emancipated or fugitive slaves. In these years no fewer than four branches of the underground railroad funneled escaping slaves through Oberlin on their way to sanctuary in Canada.</p>
        <p>Slave catchers, as well as slaves, knew of Oberlin's reputation, and on Sept. 13, 1858, a band of them seized a fugitive named John Price near Oberlin and hustled him off to the depot in nearby Wellington for the first leg of his return to bondage in Kentucky. The news flashed through Oberlin like a bolt of lightning. Students, professors, townspeople - blacks and whites - commandeered every carriage and wagon and horse in town and set off on the road to Wellington to rescue the captive before the afternoon train arrived. There was a tense confrontation, and then Price was spirited away from his captors and carried triumphantly back to Oberlin. He was hidden there in the house of a professor - a future president of the college - and then sent on his way to Canada and freedom.</p>
        <p>John Price's rescue is only half the story. So far as the authorities in Ohio and the Administration in Washington were concerned, the rescue was nothing less than civil disobedience: under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, the slave catchers in Oberlin had acted legally in seizing Price. The rescuers would be charged. ''We shall convict all the Oberlinites,'' the prosecutor promised.</p>
        <p>The court case became a national cause celebre - constitutional law versus freedom of conscience, abolitionism versus the slave power, Democrats versus Republicans. The rescue and its aftermath ''reflected in myriad ways the forces that were dividing the United States and leading to war,'' Mr. Brandt writes. He winds his way skillfully through the complex case, presenting us with a nice plot twist that finally resolves the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandt has been able to track down a remarkable amount of information about everyone in the story but one. John Price, the fugitive slave at the center of the whole tangled drama, dropped out of history's sight; his role played, he simply disappeared. He was more symbol than substance, one searcher after him concluded. To all who asked about John Price there was always the same reply: ''Never heard of since.''</p>
        <p>LONG, HOT SUMMER: 1858</p>
        <p>Oberlin was tense in the late summer of 1858. Slave hunters had made three attempts to seize black families in the community. Each had been foiled. Oberlin abolitionists liked to boast that not one slave had ever been returned to bondage from their town, yet there had never been ''an instance of bloodshed or personal harm.'' Nevertheless, the mood of Oberlin's blacks was especially wary. They were keeping watch on any strangers who arrived in town. Many of them had guns or other weapons at the ready. If John Price was aware of the danger, he did not indicate it to anyone. Perhaps he was distracted because he felt so ill. He had lost weight and was considerably bloated. He was down on his luck, too; residents were being paid out of the town's pauper funds to take him in.</p>
