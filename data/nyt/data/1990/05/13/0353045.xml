        <p>As a writer, I am familiar with the stops and starts of bringing a project into the world: the expectations, the disappointments, the longing for the normalcy of a predictable job and the awareness, not always pleasant, that there is truly nothing else one can, or must, do (''When Will the Book Be Done?'' April 15). Thus, I was touched by Susan Sheehan's depiction of such a writer's life, both her own and her husband, Neil's. I was moved by Neil's dedication and thrilled at his deserved triumph. And I have tremendous respect for the marriage/partnership sustained by the Sheehans, through their mutual belief in each other. Thank you for an inspiring portrait.</p>
