        <p>''The system by which American campaigns are financed is out of control and getting worse.'' So says Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, agrees, and the two men promise their best efforts toward serious reform.</p>
        <p>Now comes the hard part: forging bipartisan legislation that can rescue the Senate's honor by correcting the present reliance on campaign contributions from favor-seekers.</p>
        <p>Any day now, the Senate will start negotiating over bills offered by both parties. The Democrats have a stronger reform package but the Republicans also have some good ideas. There's real reason to hope consensus can be achieved - if Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole can find common ground on four principal issues:</p>
        <p>Political Action Committees. The PAC grip on Congress cannot be denied, not when senators now up for re-election will receive an average of $1 million in funds from these special-interest funnels. Senators of both parties now endorse a PAC ban. But such a sweeping approach might well be declared unconstitutional. If so, Republicans offer a plausible fallback - limit PAC gifts to $1,000 instead of $5,000.</p>
        <p>Alternative Financing. Republicans, alas, remain opposed to public financing for Senate elections. But the Democrats, taking an idea from Republican Senator John Danforth of Missouri, propose a decent compromise: Offer Senate candidates free television time for campaign messages longer than the 30-second spots that now dominate. That would bring down campaign costs dramatically, thereby enhancing competition. It would also make sense to provide low-cost mail for all candidates and restrict incumbents' franking privilege.</p>
        <p>Spending Limits. The incessant need for members to raise money won't end until spending limits are imposed. Misguided G.O.P. opposition to such limits killed reform in the last Congress. Now there's a potential deadlock-breaker: ''flexible'' limits of the sort embraced by Democrats. The idea came from a bipartisan panel appointed at Senator Dole's urging. The concept is to set an overall limit but exempt small gifts from a candidate's home state.</p>
        <p>Sewer Money. Real reform is impossible until Congress closes the immense loophole through which wealthy favor-seekers evade present Federal contribution limits. They channel money to state parties, from which it goes to individual candidates. Euphemistically, politicos call this ''soft'' money; sewer money is more accurate.</p>
        <p>The Democratic bill would block the sewer and Senator Mitchell is entitled to praise for supporting that despite resistance in his own party. Republicans complain that rules permitting voter education and get-out-the-vote drives by unions are often abused. But their proposed restrictions amount to overkill.</p>
        <p>Even in the heat of the giant scandal over savings and loan contributions, achieving reform won't be easy. The Senate, after all, comprises 100 campaign finance experts, each wary of changes that might jeopardize re-election. Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole can keep negotiations on track and partisan posturing to a minimum. They deserve credit and support. The integrity of the Senate is on the line.</p>
