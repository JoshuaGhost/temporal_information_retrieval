        <p>LEAD: For Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, even bad news brings some respite these days.</p>
        <p>For Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, even bad news brings some respite these days.</p>
        <p>Retail prices rose 9.4 percent over the 12 months that ended April 10, the Central Statistical Office reported on Friday. It was the highest rate of increase since the year that ended in May 1982. But since the figure was lower than the 10 percent forecast the previous day by the Bank of England, stock market prices rose on Friday, and the Government maintained that its anti-inflation policies were working.</p>
        <p>The Government has found other silver linings. Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party won only 27.9 percent of the vote in the nationwide elections for local councils on May 3. But it took majorities in several important London districts, which encouraged the Prime Minister to believe that her Government had finally turned the corner.</p>
        <p>But victories like these have not ended an incipient revolt by Conservative members of the House of Commons against her leadership of the party, several members of Parliament said in interviews this week.</p>
        <p>Backbench Conservative members of Parliament like Tony Marlow, who describes himself as a Thatcherite, and Barry Porter, also previously regarded as a loyalist, have been saying that it is time for her to make way for someone more popular.</p>
        <p>''The Iron Lady might be susceptible to metal fatigue,'' Mr. Marlow wrote in The Independent newspaper recently. This week he said he saw no reason to reconsider his words after the mixed results in the local elections.</p>
        <p>''Someone more popular'' is generally taken to mean Michael Heseltine, the former Defense Secretary who resigned from Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 after she refused to accept his advice to keep a British helicopter company in European hands rather than let an American company buy it. But as long as Mrs. Thatcher has shown a determination to brook no challenge to her leadership, Mr. Heseltine has not issued one.</p>
        <p>Some people thought he had done so in an article on Thursday in the Times of London. In the column, Mr. Heseltine spelled out ways that the Government could modify one of Mrs. Thatcher's most unpopular measures, the per capita community charge on local government services known as the poll tax. The tax, which is set at the same rate for dukes and dustmen by local government councils, was generally viewed as the cause of the Government's poor showing in the recent vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heseltine said he accepted the idea that everybody should pay a fair share of the costs of paving the streets and collecting the garbage, but argued that the tax should be modified so that the rich paid more than the poor.</p>
        <p>Pressed on Thursday night on a television broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Heseltine backed off from an open challenge. ''I think Mrs. Thatcher will lead the party into the next election,'' he said. ''I think the Conservatives will win it. That is my position.''</p>
        <p>That view is held more firmly at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's office. One official there said that public opinion polls, which had shown the opposition Labor Party leading by more than 20 percent in recent months, had begun to register a shift in support to the Conservatives in April.</p>
        <p>People close to Mrs. Thatcher said that she dismissed the opposition from Mr. Marlow and Mr. Porter as insignificant. A former minister suggested that her view was incorrect and that an open move to challenge her could be expected this summer, or by the autumn at the latest.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher does not have to call an election until mid-1992, and her close aides say that she will wait for inflation and 15 percent interest rates to decline before she puts her fate to the country. Others speculate that her husband, Denis, now 75 years old, might prevail on her to bow out.</p>
        <p>Both Conservative and Labor members of Parliament agree that public anger over the poll tax is fiercer than any discontent they have seen since Mrs. Thatcher first took office in 1979.</p>
        <p>''The pressure to do something about it will continue,'' one Conservative legislator said. ''I've got to worry about keeping my own seat in the next election, not just getting her re-elected.''</p>
