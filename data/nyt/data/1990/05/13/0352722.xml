        <p>LEAD: COMPANIES</p>
        <p>Partying, the Fed's Way</p>
        <p>Federal Reserve Board chairmen have never tired of repeating William McChesney Martin's definition of their role: ''To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.'' Now comes the current chairman, Alan Greenspan, to urge bankers to keep partying even without the punch bowl.</p>
        <p>COMPANIES</p>
        <p>Partying, the Fed's Way</p>
        <p>Federal Reserve Board chairmen have never tired of repeating William McChesney Martin's definition of their role: ''To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.'' Now comes the current chairman, Alan Greenspan, to urge bankers to keep partying even without the punch bowl. He joined other top regulators on Thursday in asking bank executives to continue lending to sound customers, rather than strangle the economy with tight credit. ''The nature of banking is risk-taking,'' Mr. Greenspan reportedly said. ''And if you have zero loan losses, then you aren't doing your job.'' The bankers responded with complaints about the regulators' previous party-pooping: warnings about imprudent real estate loans; tougher restrictions on small-business loans; Federal auditors swarming over the bankers' books, forcing them to take losses. Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, says the Fed would rather have banks provide more credit than risk easing its own interest rates. ''A little bit of action on all the levers,'' he said, ''is probably better than relying too much on any one of them.''</p>
        <p>Whichaway Was That?</p>
        <p>Like an unruly hospital patient who sticks his thermometer into ice water one day, hot coffee the next, the economy has been sending conflicting signals. On Friday, it was reported that inflation and economic growth had cooled. Producer prices for April were off three-tenths of 1 percent; retail sales off six-tenths of 1 percent. A couple of weeks ago, the economy and prices appeared to be near boiling. ''We seem to be doing a complete about-face,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds. The worried relatives in this case are the traders who propelled rates on Treasury bonds past 9 percent early this month. Rejoicing at Friday's news, they sent rates down to about 8.66 percent as the stock market soared 63.07 points.</p>
        <p>Tax, Here Comes Thy Sting</p>
        <p>In the movies as in politics, the unpalatable or unwholesome seeks refuge in euphemism. Everyone knows what adult entertainment is, and soon everyone will know the meaning of budget talks to proceed, in the President's words, with ''no conditions.'' Conditions and preconditions ruling out tax increases dropped faster than Washington's cherry blossoms amid estimates last week of a 1991 budget deficit as high as $165 billion.</p>
        <p>Uncle Sam's Sale Days</p>
        <p>Anyone trying to sell a Houston house, a Miami hotel or a Denver condominium had better do it fast lest the Government dump similar properties next door. The Resolution Trust Corporation decided last week to allow markdowns on its $16 billion-plus inventory of real estate from troubled savings and loans. The sales have been going slowly, with delays costing taxpayers $250 million a month.</p>
        <p>Rate Break for the Treasury</p>
        <p>No credit-market calamities in the Treasury's quarterly auctions. The Government sold $31 billion in notes and bonds at rates higher than in February, but lower than market watchers had feared.</p>
        <p>ECONOMY</p>
        <p>Just Wait for Icahn's Act II USX X stays intact; Carl C. Icahn stays in touch. Mr. Icahn conceded last week that the company's stockholders had voted down his plan to get rid of the steel business but stay in the energy business. Mr. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, said his scheme would make USX stock soar; the company's partisans said it would merely help a corporate raider cash in his stake at a huge profit. Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber, says that USX might eventually compromise by selling some of the steel operation to the public without spinning it off entirely. One way or another, he said, the company will still have to reckon with Mr. Icahn. ''He's not going to disappear,'' Mr. Jacoboski said. ''There will definitely be another act.''</p>
        <p>The Dime Has a New Chief</p>
        <p>Remarkable how little attention Richard D. Parsons got last Monday for becoming the first black chief executive of a financial institution as large as the Dime Savings Bank of New York. But Mr. Parsons, 42, is just as happy: ''I don't like to blow that horn,'' he said. He would sooner speak of having been counsel to Nelson A. Rockefeller as both Governor of New York and Vice President, or his former partnership in a law firm that served the Dime, or his plans for expanding the Dime's size without expanding its risks. With $11.7 billion in assets, the Dime, is regarded as one of the healthiest savings and loans in the Northeast. It avoided lending to construction projects and leveraged buyouts, but some mortgage loans have soured. Look for the Dime to pursue more consumer business and more acquisitions.</p>
        <p>The Mass Market Work Station</p>
        <p>The work station - the heavy-duty desktop computer favored by scientists and engineers - is elbowing its way into the personal computer market. Price is key; Wall Street analysts said that Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to introduce a powerful model this week that will sell for $5,000, about the cost of some high-end personal computers but faster, with whiz-bang graphics. They expect the work station to be a hit with major corporations, whose quantity discounts will pull the price down to about $3,000. Mark D. Stahlman, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, says that the company has attracted orders to install several extensive work station networks. He predicts that Sun will provide hardware for companies that might otherwise have bought personal computers. ''They are in a unique position to win large commercial bids,'' he said. Rivals - including Hewlett-Packard's Apollo division, which sells a less powerful work station for under $4,000 - say they are ready to match whatever Sun offers.</p>
        <p>In Brief</p>
        <p>Cats can be environmentally correct, too. Alpo Petfoods Inc. said last week that its cat food will contain only tuna caught with nets that don't snare dolphins as well.</p>
        <p>*</p>
        <p>The natin's largest coal company is the subject of a bidding war. Amax Inc. bid $1.25 billion for the Peabody Coal Company on Friday. Hanson P.L.C. of Britain, which owns 45 percent of Peabody, offered $725.6 million for the rest.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>Ponying Up for the I.M.F.</p>
        <p>The International Monetary Fund's agreement last week to add $60 billion to its loan pool looks as much like the start of a debate as the end. United States reluctance in three years of negotiations helped delay an agreement on higher fund contributions initially scheduled for completion in 1988. Several I.M.F. members say the new money will be inadequate to save third world nations from their staggering debts or convert Eastern Europe into a modern market economy. ''They've already been too niggardly in the amounts they've made available.'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. The United States has agreed to consider increases in financing in 1993. If the talks take as long as the last round, they might best begin tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Super-Concorde, Super Price</p>
        <p>British Aerospace and the French Aerospatiale had hoped to sell 300 Concordes. They sold 13. On Wednesday, they came out with plans to build a plane that could fly twice as far with twice the passengers, and cost more than four times as much to develop. The original Concorde has fallen victim to the unforeseen. Much higher fuel prices made its flights economical only for European and Wall Street royalty; a short range kept it from linking Asia with other continents, and its noise kept it from flying from coast to coast in the United States. As for the super-Concorde, it would take super-long to develop - five years for research, eight for production and at least two for testing. Who can say that a $9 billion to $14 billion bet on what the world will be like in the year 2005 will turn out any better than the $2 billion bet on the situation in the 1970's?</p>
        <p>Forget German Inflation, O.K.?</p>
        <p>West German officials declared last week that fretting about any inflation resulting from reunification is verboten. Fie on the bond traders who have beaten down West German debt on fears of inflation. Even Karl Otto Pohl, president of the nation's central bank, has joined the pacification and soothing squad. A few months ago, he was positively alarmist, saying that rapid currency union with East Germany was sure to unleash new, inflationary demand for West German goods. Politicians rushed along the reunification process anyway. Last week, Mr. Pohl assured International Monetary Fund representatives that a common currency ''will not lead to unreasonable inflation pressures.'' Some economists are revising their views likewise, after discovering that the East Germans might have too little money to make any blessed difference.</p>
        <p>Wyoming in New York</p>
        <p>From Bauhaus to our house to the Ginza: Tom Wolfe, the writer, turned up in a panel discussion last week to compare New York, whose business culture he has written about exhaustively, with Tokyo, which he has just visited. He found Tokyo far more crowded but far cleaner. ''New York looks like Wyoming compared to Tokyo, and yet there is no litter,'' he said. ''I went to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and there was the same frenzy, but there was no paper on the floor. There were people who catch it before it hits the floor.'' But Kazuki Kasuya, a leading Japanese magazine editor, said his nation was eagerly absorbing New York's influence the way it once adopted Buddhism from China. ''New York has become the city of admiration,'' he said, where young Japanese dream of going ''to be recognized as world-class artists or businessmen.''</p>
