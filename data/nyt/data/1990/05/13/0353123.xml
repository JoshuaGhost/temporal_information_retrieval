        <p>ARNOLD SPEERT, the president of William Paterson College, remembers sitting next to his baseball coach, Jeff Albies, as a player spoke to the team at a dinner last year. The player was far from the best student ever to play for Mr. Albies, but a year after his eligibility ran out he was there to tell his team how much he had learned from playing baseball for Mr. Albies and how much he could apply to his life after he graduated that spring.</p>
        <p>''Jeff leaned back,'' Dr. Speert said, ''and mumbled under his breath, 'There is a God.' That's the kind of warmth he has.''</p>
        <p>That warmth and rapport with players have been one of the keys to Mr. Albies's success as coach of the William Paterson Pioneers for 16 years.</p>
        <p>At the end of the regular season this year, the Pioneers, who compete in Division III, had a 408-176-7 record under Mr. Albies, and a 65-42-2 record against Division I opponents. His teams have been New Jersey Athletic Conference champions the last four years, made the N.C.A.A. Division III regionals the last nine years and participated three times in the Division III College World Series for small colleges.</p>
        <p>Since 1980, 11 of his players have been named All-America. Eleven have signed professional contracts, as many as Rutgers in New Brunswick, which is in Division I, has produced over the same period.</p>
        <p>A Model for Another Coach</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to model my program after his,'' said Ron Van Sader, coach at the Rutgers campus in Newark, whose team competes in Division III.</p>
        <p>Norm Schoenig, coach of a conference rival, Montclair State College, said: ''He always puts his players first. I think that's why they've responded over the years.''</p>
        <p>And the players and their parents continue to respond. Some former players visit and volunteer time, equipment and money year after year. The parents of more than a dozen players followed the team on a March trip to Florida. And 10 former players are coaching baseball, some as assistants at William Paterson.</p>
        <p>''Jeff has raised coaching from an art to a science,'' Dr. Speert said. ''It isn't a baseball team. It isn't a series of games. It's a program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Albies, who is 44 years old, grew up in the Bronx and in Glendale, Queens, went to Bishop Laughlin High School in Queens and graduated from Long Island University.</p>
        <p>A low round pick in the professional baseball draft, he spent three years in the Atlanta Braves' farm system. He went on to receive other degrees from Hunter College and Fordham University, teach fourth-grade physcial education in New York City and coach the junior varsity baseball team at City College. With the help of Mr. Van Sader, a William Paterson alumnus and a fellow player in the Metropolitan Semi-Pro League, he was hired as coach in 1975.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albies says that the universities provided him with credentials and that Bishop Laughlin, with its history of athletic and academic success, gave him an understanding of what tradition and community support can do for a program. But professional baseball did the most to shape his approach to baseball as a coach. It taught him perspective.</p>
        <p>''It ate me up,'' Mr. Albies said, recalling the way he dealt with pressure that he put on himself during his stint in the minors. ''I learned from that. If I was ever going to coach young men, I was going to impart the best way to play the game, because the game can tear people up.''</p>
        <p>The best way, for Mr. Albies, is a relaxed way, with more teaching than regimentation, more friendship than authority, and the understanding that baseball is not all there is to life.</p>
        <p>''He just lets you get on the field and play,'' said Garrett Teel, a 1989 graduate now with the Dodgers' Class A team in Bakersfield, Calif. ''He wouldn't get on you about little things. He'll help you as a friend, not as a coach. And you don't have to look over your shoulder every time you make a mistake.''</p>
        <p>'I'm Just Like They Are'</p>
        <p>Mr. Albies said: ''I'm nobody special. I'm just like they are; I'm plodding through also. Maybe because I was not a very good professional baseball player myself, I can identify with their needs.</p>
        <p>''All of our kids have foibles. That's why they're not at big places. The reality is I enjoy that imperfect kid.'' Success as a coach begins with getting good players, which can be tricky on the Division III level, where no athletic scholarships are permitted. The typical William Paterson baseball player is just short of what he needs to get the scholarship to the school he desires. He might be too small or too slow or have too weak an arm.</p>
        <p>''There are an awful lot of kids who have one or two outstanding qualities, not necessarily that make them a prospect, but that make them good college baseball players,'' Mr. Albies said. ''We try to find that one thing that will make the kid successful and enjoy himself.''</p>
        <p>The players say there are few on the team who do not dream of getting a professional contract. Despite their success at William Paterson, most will not have that chance.</p>
        <p>The coach keeps after players to make sure they keep up with their academics and makes himself available for advice as a friend rather than as an authority figure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albies says that getting players like Dan Pasqua, the former Yankee now playing with the White Sox, or Joe Lynch, a pitcher for the San Diego Padres' Triple A affiliate, was a matter of luck.</p>
        <p>Yet the process of convincing these players that William Paterson is the school that best fits their needs has more to do with Mr. Albies than he readily admits.</p>
        <p>Ralph Perdromo, a sophomore first baseman, was recruited by Division I schools but chose William Paterson. ''I liked Coach Albies,'' he said. ''It looked like he was willing to help. And there's his reputation.''</p>
        <p>'There Was Trust There'</p>
        <p>Not long ago Mr. Albies had an All-America third baseman who presented the coach with few problems, until the coach moved him to shortstop the next year. It took most of the season for the player to accept the change, and he was named All-America at that position as well.</p>
        <p>''I give him credit, because there was trust there,'' Mr. Albies said. ''He didn't believe in it himself, but he believed that I knew what I was doing. There's a strong sense of pride - not that he made All-America, but that he believed enough in me to stay.''</p>
        <p>Most of his players seem to trust him for his honesty, for never leading them on as recruits or starters and for giving everyone a fair shot. They trust his judgment as a teacher and as a game coach because of his professional background and his record of making the right moves.</p>
        <p>But most of all, they trust him because he makes the extra effort for them.</p>
        <p>''If the door was closed all the time and I was aloof to the needs of my players, there would be none of this I'm talking about,'' he said. ''I enjoy the interaction. Maybe that's what keeps me from going big time, because when you go big time, the atmosphere changes.</p>
        <p>''I can be a little bit more personal here and provide a direction for them. That's what I'm comfortable with.''</p>
        <p>Creating a Community</p>
        <p>For Mr. Albies, success is determined differently than at the Division I level. It is not just victories but ''how the program projects itself.''</p>
        <p>''I want to get to the point where this program can run by itself,'' he said. What he has done to this end is create a community. He invited and made all the arrangements for the parents who traveled to Florida with the team.</p>
        <p>Newsletters are sent to team alumni, barbecues and outings are planned and players are always made welcome to return, if only to work out with the team one more time. And they do.</p>
        <p>''He's made people enjoy themselves here,'' said his assistant coach, Bob Lauterhan. ''Kids that sat the bench four years are coming back.</p>
        <p>''Do you think Penn State guys call Joe Paterno and ask him to come over on Friday nights and play cards with them? He's got that kind of rapport with all of them.''</p>
        <p>They bring money. They bring equipment. They bring themselves and volunteer to help coach those who have replaced them.</p>
        <p>''But I don't view it as a compliment,'' Mr. Albies said. ''They're friends. I know if I were to really think about it, that's probably the thing I'm most satisfied about.''</p>
        <p>The alumni are examples of success outside baseball to the current players, and for everyone involved with William Paterson baseball they are something more. They are something to belong to. A program.</p>
        <p>''I'm starting to see 15, 16 years come to something I always wanted,'' Mr. Albies said. ''I really like the people I'm with, and it takes a long time to develop that. It's not that I'm afraid to start someplace new, but I know how long it took to do this.''</p>
