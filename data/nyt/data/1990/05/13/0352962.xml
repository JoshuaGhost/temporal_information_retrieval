        <p>LEAD: There were still two games to play before the team returned home, but in the late morning, as a cool wind blew outside and clouds covered the sky, Dave Winfield packed his bags, rode to the airport with his wife, Tonya, and flew home to the New York area.</p>
        <p>There were still two games to play before the team returned home, but in the late morning, as a cool wind blew outside and clouds covered the sky, Dave Winfield packed his bags, rode to the airport with his wife, Tonya, and flew home to the New York area.</p>
        <p>Neither Winfield nor his agent was certain what course they might take next, but both indicated that the trade in which the New York Yankees sent the 38-year-old outfielder to the California Angels - and which Winfield has refused to accept - would likely be decided in arbitration.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, meanwhile, began steps toward finding a resolution to the conflict. Harding (Pete) Peterson, the team's general manager, said today that the Yankees were attempting to set up a hearing in front of an arbitrator, which could take place as early as Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I think it would be more to the California Angels' benefit to get it done quickly as possible,'' Peterson said. ''We've already got our player; they want theirs.''</p>
        <p>Confusion Persists</p>
        <p>At the moment, the Angels do not have him. Winfield returned home, and Mike Witt, the pitcher acquired by the Yankees in the deal, was expected to join his new team tonight, but the whole confusion surrounding the trade remained.</p>
        <p>Before leaving, Winfield said he intended to speak this weekend with his attorney, Jeff Klein, before deciding how to proceed.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going home right now,'' he said. ''I'll do what I think is best for Winfield. That could be anything.''</p>
        <p>Winfield has refused to accept his trade to the Angels, saying that he cannot be dealt away because he has 10 years in the major leagues and 5 with the same team. Under the basic labor agreement between owners and players, the approval of so-called 10-and-5 players is required before any trade can be completed.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, however, say they have a right to trade Winfield because of a clause in his contract, signed before the 1981 season, that says he must provide them with a list of seven teams to which he might agree to be traded. Winfield has annually drawn a list, although he has maintained that he has done it only to give the Yankees a sense of which clubs he might consider playing for.</p>
        <p>'No Reflection on Angels'</p>
        <p>If Winfield continues in his refusal to join the Angels, baseball's impartial arbitrator, George Nicalau, would have to resolve the conflict. So far, Winfield has not budged.</p>
        <p>''As of now, I suppose we're going to arbitration,'' said Klein, reached at his home in New York.</p>
        <p>Klein said he had spoken on Friday night with Mike Port, the Angels' general manager, but only to tell him that Winfield would not report.</p>
        <p>''I put in a call to let him know that this was neither a reflection on him nor on the Angels,'' Klein said.</p>
        <p>Asked if Winfield would reconsider his position if the Angels offered him a two-year contract, Klein said: ''That's nothing but speculation at this point. I say that because David and I haven't talked about it. There have been so many rumors over the years that we've never found it constructive to deal in the abstract.''</p>
        <p>But he also did not rule out the possibility that Winfield could be persuaded to join the Angels.</p>
        <p>''I suppose anything is possible,'' he said. ''Could there be an inducement? There might be.''</p>
        <p>Fehr Backs Winfield</p>
        <p>Klein also indicated that he had been in contact with Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players' association.</p>
        <p>''Don's feeling is the same as it's always been, that David's position is the correct one,'' he said. ''I called to advise him what was going on, and his interest is the same as mine, to do what's best for David.''</p>
        <p>Klein said that Winfield would accept a return to the Yankees, even though it is clear he does not have a place and appears to be unwanted.</p>
        <p>''His teammates want him, that seems fairly clear,'' he said. ''The pitchers don't want to face him. People in New York have responded favorably to him. David has never been one to run away from something.''</p>
        <p>Of the Yankees' failure to inform either him or Winfield of the trade before it was announced, Klein said: ''The manner in which it was handled was not the most constructive. But the way the Yankees do things can never be predicted. I think it's unfortunate they chose to handle it the way they did.''</p>
        <p>Peterson said Witt would take Winfield's spot on the roster, leaving the Yankees with 12 pitchers. The team will make a move, sending down a pitcher and calling up a player from their Columbus affiliate, although probably not until it returns home on Monday.</p>
        <p>Within two weeks to a month, Peterson said, the Yankees will call up Deion Sanders and install him as the regular left fielder.</p>
        <p>''In my judgment, when Deion comes up here, he must play every day,'' Peterson said. ''To me, he can be an electrifying, exciting player.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are hoping to entice Sanders to remain in baseball and put his football career with the Atlanta Falcons on hold. Peterson said there is a clause in Sanders's contract with the Yankees that would require him to remain with the team if he is on the roster when the Falcons' camp opens in July.</p>
        <p>Winfield's 'Spirits Good'</p>
        <p>It is clear by their action that the Yankees are willing to give Sanders the same chance they did not give Winfield, who was made a platoon player by Manager Bucky Dent before he had been given an opportunity to show that he was fully recovered from back surgery.</p>
        <p>''Each case,'' Peterson said, ''is taken on an individual basis.''</p>
        <p>But while Sanders could be starting his career with the Yankees, Winfield's seems to be ending. Still, he is remaining positive.</p>
        <p>''My spirits are always good,'' he said. ''I'm fine. There were some interesting revelations yesterday. I've seen a lot.''</p>
