        <p>LEAD: With all of the fuss about ABC's ''Twin Peaks,'' there has been precious little attention left over for a new NBC sitcom called ''Wings,'' which is running directly opposite ''Twin Peaks'' on Thursdays at 9:30 and is quietly chalking up a far more impressive ratings record. Of course, it helps enormously that ''Wings'' immediately follows ''Cheers,'' one of NBC's most popular series.</p>

        <p>LEAD: With all of the fuss about ABC's ''Twin Peaks,'' there has been precious little attention left over for a new NBC sitcom called ''Wings,'' which is running directly opposite ''Twin Peaks'' on Thursdays at 9:30 and is quietly chalking up a far more impressive ratings record. Of course, it helps enormously that ''Wings'' immediately follows ''Cheers,'' one of NBC's most popular series.</p>
        <p>With all of the fuss about ABC's ''Twin Peaks,'' there has been precious little attention left over for a new NBC sitcom called ''Wings,'' which is running directly opposite ''Twin Peaks'' on Thursdays at 9:30 and is quietly chalking up a far more impressive ratings record. Of course, it helps enormously that ''Wings'' immediately follows ''Cheers,'' one of NBC's most popular series. And, as it happens, the new show has been created by three Emmy Award-winning former ''Cheers'' staffers: David Angell, Peter Casey and David Lee, all producers and writers. They are the executive producers of ''Wings.''</p>
        <p>''Wings'' is a shamelessly amiable show. Like ''Cheers,'' it offers a collection of mildly offbeat characters who grow on you if given half a chance. It also has one of the more unusual settings yet devised for a sitcom. The action takes place in an airline terminal at Tom Nevers Field on the island of Nantucket. One of the local commuter operations, Sandpiper Air, is a one-plane business owned by two brothers, Joe (Timothy Daly) and Brian Hackett (Steven Weber), pilots who love to fly. That's about the only thing they have in common.</p>
        <p>The comedy territory is familiar. This is ''Odd Couple'' land. Joe is an obsessive-compulsive type, buttoned into neat shirts and conservative ties. Brian is a chronic cutup, partial to trendy fashions and zippy wisecracks. Several years earlier, he had run off with Carol, Joe's girlfriend, to open an air service in the Caribbean. Carol, however, dumped Brian for someone else, and now he is back on Nantucket helping Joe run Sandpiper Air. Commenting on Joe's wardrobe, Brian goes into mock anxiety: ''Boy, you miss one issue of GQ and the fashion world passes you by.''</p>
        <p>The weekly regulars, the backbone of any sitcom, include Helen (Crystal Bernard), an aspiring cellist who runs the airport's lunch counter. Once the fat little playmate of the Hackett brothers, she is now a sexy young woman who has no qualms about being blunt with her old friends. There are also Roy (David Schramm), the somewhat gross owner of a rival airline; Fay (Rebecca Schull), a former flight attendant who runs the Sandpiper ticket counter with goofy cheerfulness, and Lowell (Thomas Haden Church), the plane-maintenance worker whose booming commentaries seem to come from outer space. His family has lived on Nantucket for 50 years -probably in the same room, someone mutters.</p>
        <p>Plot seasonings are added with the assortment of types passing through the airport. Last week, the second episode featured an elderly gentleman who had flown around the world but was reluctant to take the last 40-minute hop of the trip because he was convinced that completion spelled death. Meanwhile, Helen had a cello audition in Boston and pondered Brian's suggestion to wear something sexy to catch the conductor's eye. (''A little cleavage on the high notes,'' he urged.) Sleazy, demeaning, thought Helen, but then she cheered up, realizing that ''until recently, I've been so overweight I've never had the option of being sleazy and demeaning.''</p>
        <p>Tonight begins a two-part episode, ''Return to Nantucket,'' that brings Carol (Kim Johnston) back into the lives of Joe and Brian. Hearing that she has a new job in London (''Boy, is she going to be disappointed when she finds out that Big Ben is a clock''), Brian takes the company plane and rushes off, through heavy fog, to what he hopes will be a reconciliation during her stopover in Boston. Assuming that Brian is just heading for another disappointment, Joe and Helen follow to console him. Meanwhile, back at the ticket counter, the dizzily perky Fay (think of any Betty White character) is apologizing for yet another flight delay, but ''on the bright side, freedom and democracy have broken out in Eastern Europe.''</p>
        <p>Being given a trial run of seven episodes, ''Wings'' is already feeling remarkably comfortable. The scripts, variously written by the executive producers and Philip LaZebnick, the executive story consultant, are generally clever. The direction - James Burrows did the first episode, Noam Pitlik the rest - is spiffily professional. And, perhaps most important, the two leads are consistently charming. Mr. Daly, seen in the movie ''Diner,'' the stage production ''Coastal Disturbances'' and the television series ''Almost Grown,'' is a fine actor only waiting for the big breakthrough. ''Wings'' could do the trick. And Steven Weber, who played young John F. Kennedy in ''The Kennedys of Massachusetts,'' gives this particular odd couple its perfectly mischievous spin. ''Wings'' may have legs.</p>
