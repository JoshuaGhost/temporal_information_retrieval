        <p>LEAD: ''Coppelia'' is one of the sunniest ballets in the New York City Ballet repertory, and it received a bright and bounding performance on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>''Coppelia'' is one of the sunniest ballets in the New York City Ballet repertory, and it received a bright and bounding performance on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>This staging of the ballet by George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova, a noted interpreter of the ballerina role, has something to offer just about everyone. The ballet tells its story -of a strong-willed village lass, Swanilda; her rambunctious fiance, Frantz, and a misanthropic old doll-maker named Dr. Coppelius - with enough clarity, humor and drama to draw chortles and murmurs from children, as it did at the matinee.</p>
        <p>There is enough virtuoso dancing and spectacle to satisfy adult dancegoers. The Delibes score is deliciously melodic and bouncy. And the ballet, modeled on an 1884 version by Marius Petipa that was known to Balanchine and Miss Danilova as young dancers in Russia, offers its performers many chances to shine.</p>
        <p>Nichol Hlinka and Damian Woetzel gave strong performances of Swanilda and Frantz. The musicality of Ms. Hlinka's phrasing in the first and last acts was particularly compelling, but there was a mechanical quality to some of her characterization and dancing. Mr. Woetzel's Frantz was an endearing blend of brashness and tenderness. His dancing was a little rough at times, though never his partnering, but once again there was the great pleasure of watching Mr. Woetzel challenge himself fearlessly on stage, as he so consistently does, while never losing sight of the shape of the role.</p>
        <p>Leonid Kozlov's Dr. Coppelius was a practical, irritable codger with very few of the nuances that Shaun O'Brien, the great character dancer for whom the role was created, brings to his interpretation. Roma Sosenko made a gracious role debut leading the Waltz of the Golden Hours and its troupe of tiny dancers from the School of American Ballet, rehearsed by Garielle Whittle. They offered some of the most precise and expansive dancing of the afternoon.</p>
        <p>The third act, choreographed by Balanchine, features several other appealing divertissements. Wendy Whelan was a brisk Dawn, with a couple of nicely held arabesques. Zippora Karz's Prayer was crisply danced, with some creamy flourishes, and Miriam Mahdaviani brought the warm glint of rubies to her Spinner. The Discord and War dance was led with appropriate flamboyance by Diana White and Philip Neal. Gordon Boelzner conducted.</p>
