        <p>Diamonds are headed for an eighth consecutive year of record sales, the world's biggest producer, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., said today. The South African-based company's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, said that world retail sales rose 4 percent in 1989 in terms of United States dollars. Growth was particularly strong last year in Europe, where economies were buoyant, and in Japan, where a tax concession on jewelry purchases helped to increase sales. In the United States, the world's largest market for polished diamonds, growth was modest because of an easing in economic activity, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson told thr De Beers shareholders.</p>
