        <p>LEAD: In the pristine subways that move Singapore's workers with near-silent efficiency, there are posters showing a young Singaporean father in a playful pillow fight with his children.

        <p>In the pristine subways that move Singapore's workers with near-silent efficiency, there are posters showing a young Singaporean father in a playful pillow fight with his children. The advertisements are part of a campaign to encourage families to have more children, the reverse of what is being sought by most of Singapore's Southeast Asian neighbors.</p>
        <p>What the ads do not mention -because every Singaporean knows it already - is that children are also the country's biggest tax break.</p>
        <p>The reason is that Singapore is trying to become a recognized center of research and development. But to make sure there are enough indigenous people with the required skills, the Government wants to raise the population from 2.7 million now to roughly 4 million early in the next century. ''We're using tax breaks to get companies to build R.&amp; D. facilities, so why not use them to fill those facilities as well?'' a mid-level Government official said recently.</p>
        <p>Singapore has a tradition of using tax incentives as a means of social and economic control. So now Singaporean couples who have a second child by the time the mother is 29 years old can get a tax deduction of roughly $10,000.</p>
        <p>While all couples are eligible for the tax incentive, officials and business leaders say it was designed with the Singaporean Chinese in mind. The Government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew has long tried to preserve the delicate ethnic mix of Singaporeans of Malay, Indian and Chinese descent. The ratio is even controlled in each building of the Government-run housing units where most of the population lives. But the Chinese, who make up about 76 percent of the population and view themselves as the moving force behind the country's economic success, say they are concerned that in the future their birthrate may lag behind that of the other groups.</p>
        <p>While part of Singapore's bureaucracy works to put more people into offices, other divisions are working to keep cars off the streets. Singaporeans who want new cars must now enter a lottery for the right to buy one.</p>
