        <p>LEAD: Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's black majority, will visit the United States next month for talks with President Bush, organizers of his trip said today. New York City officials said they were hoping to honor Mr. Mandela with a ticker-tape parade.</p>
        <p>Nelson Mandela, the leader of South Africa's black majority, will visit the United States next month for talks with President Bush, organizers of his trip said today. New York City officials said they were hoping to honor Mr. Mandela with a ticker-tape parade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandela, recently freed from 27 years in jail, will arrive in the United States on June 20 for visits to Washington, New York and three other cities, said officials of the African National Congress, of which Mr. Mandela is acting president. The three other cities will be announced in a news conference on Tuesday, organizers said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandela, 71 years old, will address a joint meeting of Congress to thank American leaders for their support during his imprisonment and for their efforts to obtain his release.</p>
        <p>But he is expected to warn that despite some reforms adopted by the white minority government of President F. W. de Klerk, ''the impression that apartheid is gone is wrong,'' said the congress's Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza, adding, ''It remains firmly in place.''</p>
        <p>Continued Sanctions Favored</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandela will urge Americans to maintain the economic sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 to keep up pressure on the South African Government to carry through with reforms, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush issued the invitation in February, shortly after Mr. Mandela was freed. The President also invited Mr. de Klerk, but details of that visit are under discussion.</p>
