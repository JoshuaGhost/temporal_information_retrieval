        <p>LEAD: It was May Day, the international day of the worker, and the 32-year-old radical in blue jeans chain-smoked and talked intensely of a revolution he is plotting in the 1990's for Latin America's largest economy.</p>
        <p>It was May Day, the international day of the worker, and the 32-year-old radical in blue jeans chain-smoked and talked intensely of a revolution he is plotting in the 1990's for Latin America's largest economy.</p>
        <p>''We want to sell two-thirds of Brazil's state companies over the next five years,'' Joao Santana said. ''We want to cut the civil service payroll from 800,000 to 250,000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santana, one of a new breed of radicals, as they are known here, who are devoted to less government and more private initiative, has a chance to act on his dream. As Secretary of Administration in Brazil's new Government of President Fernando Collor de Mello, Mr. Santana's job is to reverse Brazil's centuries-old tradition of big government. 15,000 Jobs Cut Mr. Santana is typical of the young and determined professionals that came to power here with the March 15 inauguration of Mr. Collor, who is 40 years old. The new economy minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, is 37. The president of the central bank, Ibrahim Eris, is 45. Their program of deep cuts in Government spending and payroll is considered radical in Brazil, where civil servants have for decades had virtually ironclad job security.</p>
        <p>Representative of the free market winds sweeping through this capital on Brazil's high plains, Mr. Santana previously worked as the opinion page editor of Gazeta Mercantil, the daily newspaper of Sao Paulo's entrepreneurial class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collor assigned Mr. Santana, a lawyer, to coordinate the cutting of the Government payroll and the sale of state companies. To date, 15,000 civil servants have been cut, with a plan for dismissing an additional 360,000 expected on June 18.</p>
        <p>Ministers who drag their feet will risk two punishments: loss of half the positions they may fill by personal appointments and direct intervention by the administration secretariat.</p>
        <p>The broad powers given Mr. Santana are a key part of three-pronged anti-inflation attack begun by Mr. Collor against the public deficit. The strategy calls for raising taxes, reducing interest payments on the internal debt and slashing Government spending. In the 12 months leading up to Mr. Collor's inauguration, consumer prices in Brazil jumped almost 5,000 percent.</p>
        <p>Although Government officials say inflation is now at 3 percent, many fear that the rate is moving higher because currency frozen by the Government in March to curb inflation is finding its way back into the economy. That makes Government spending cuts all the more imperative.</p>
        <p>'Had Lost Control'</p>
        <p>The mark of change is already on this city, which was inaugurated in 1960 as a modernistic ode to bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Across an avenue from the presidential offices here, about 500 state cars are parked in rows, awaiting public auction on May 19. They are part of 4,300 vehicles seized under a new rule that limits state cars to the President, the Vice President and the 12 ministers.</p>
        <p>''We had only 2,000 cars registered,'' Mr. Santana said. ''It shows how the state had lost control.''</p>
        <p>Also scheduled for auction are 50 mansions and 9,391 apartments, which were owned and maintained by the Government and reserved for the civil service elite.</p>
        <p>Across a lake here, in an exclusive neighborhood called ''Peninsula of the Ministers,'' a large billboard in front of two mansions reads: ''Unpopular houses for sale.'' The mansions are former Government-maintained ministerial residences.</p>
        <p>''Civil servants are very worried,'' one man said as he wheeled his car down the suburban streets here for an impromptu mansion tour. ''The sale of cars is not as traumatic, because most midlevel functionaries already have their own car,'' said the man, a political consultant who asked not to be identified because he lives in a Government-provided apartment.</p>
        <p>Spurring Mr. Santana forward is the belief among Brazil's leaders that the Government should cut special privileges to civil servants and should withdraw to basics: education, housing, health and transportation.</p>
        <p>''In recent years, the state became an industrialist,'' said Mr. Santana, who is living in a hotel until the remaining 1,000 Government-owned apartments are divided among top civil servants.</p>
        <p>Transfers to the Amazon</p>
        <p>Brazil's 1988 constitution makes it virtually impossible for the Government to dismiss civil servants with more than five years of federal employment. To encourage them to quit, Mr. Santana plans to order thousands of civil servants to stay home ''on call.'' Salaries of employees ''on call'' can be cut by up to two-thirds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santana also plans to transfer employees to distant posts, like the Amazon. Thirty years after the federal capital moved here, there are still twice as many federal employees in Rio de Janeiro, a seaside city, as in Brasilia, an interior city.</p>
        <p>''If they refuse a transfer, they can be dismissed,'' said Mr. Santana, who added that he was drawing up a list of inhospitable spots.</p>
        <p>To speed up privatization, the Government plans to force banks, insurance companies and pension funds to use an as-yet-unspecified amount of their assets to purchase ''privatization certificates.'' Foreign creditor banks are expected to be able to exchange Brazil debt for these certificates, which will represent shares in state companies.</p>
        <p>Tapping the mass of cash blocked on March 16, about $80 billion, the Government is expected to allow individuals to use blocked money to buy shares in state companies.</p>
        <p>''Everything is 'privatizable,' '' Miss Cardoso, the economy minister, said in a separate interview. ''The goal is to privatize everything that can be privatized.''</p>
        <p>Several blocks away, at the central bank, Mr. Eris echoed this conviction: ''Practically everything that the public sector owns will be up for sale.''</p>
        <p>Challenges Expected</p>
        <p>Some business people and academicians are skeptical that Mr. Collor will be able to work his revolution.</p>
        <p>''There will be scores of legal suits, labor actions and challenges by creditors,'' David V. Fleischer, a political science professor here, predicted of the privatization drive. ''Can the Ministry of Education function without two-thirds of its people? I doubt it.''</p>
        <p>Undeterred by such criticism, Mr. Santana said ministers had been ordered to redeploy their workers so that a maximum of 30 percent were in administration and a minimum of 70 percent were delivering basic services.</p>
        <p>''A World Bank study recently found that 60 to 70 percent of our budget is consumed by administration,'' he said. ''That means that for each dollar destined for education, only 30 cents reaches the classroom.''</p>
