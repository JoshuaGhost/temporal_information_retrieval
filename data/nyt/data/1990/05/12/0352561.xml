        <p>Dale Riley, a spokesman at the Potosi Correctional Center, said that when Mr. Stokes learned that his appeals had been denied, he asked for a sedative but took the news calmly. ''His only comment was that he did not want any personal witnesses,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Wife Visits Prison</p>
        <p>Mr. Stokes's wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the afternoon but left the prison shortly after 6 P.M., the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The full appellate court for the Eighth Circuit refused this morning to lift the stay. The state's Attorney General, William Webster, promptly turned to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Even while the stay was in effect, prison officials continued to prepare for the execution. Mr. Stokes ordered another last meal, his second in two days.</p>
        <p>The prison spokesman said Mr. Stokes ordered catfish, french fries, cole slaw and a two-liter bottle of soda. As his earlier on Thursday, last meal, he ordered sirloin steak, wild rice and soda.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision lifting the stay was issued at 8:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>An opinion concurring in the decision was signed by Justice Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
        <p>Justice William J. Brennan Jr. was joined in a dissenting opinion by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun. Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, another three-judge panel of the appellate court refused to lift the stay. That order was appealed to the full court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stokes's lawyer, Richard Sindel, said Federal District Judge George Gunn Jr. granted the stay Wednesday on the basis of arguments contending that Mr. Stokes's trial court failed to differentiate between felony murder and capital murder in its instructions.</p>
