        <p>LEAD: In an unusual example of regional cooperation, the governors of New York and three New England states have agreed to increase land purchases and adopt tax incentives to preserve their sprawling northern forests and to support forest-related industry.</p>
        <p>In an unusual example of regional cooperation, the governors of New York and three New England states have agreed to increase land purchases and adopt tax incentives to preserve their sprawling northern forests and to support forest-related industry.</p>
        <p>The accord, announced last week, reflects the growing anxiety in the Northeast over increasing development in the 26 million acres of nearly contiguous northern forests in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.</p>
        <p>That the states were able to overcome their usual doubts about interstate cooperation suggests how great their concern is, conservationists and government officials said.</p>
        <p>Seeking Federal Grants</p>
        <p>The four-state consensus was reached by the Governors' Task Force on Northern Lands, formed two years ago to study changes in the woodlands. In a report, the 12-member group recommended the creation of a Northern Forest Lands Council to carry on the study of the region and to promote land conservation.</p>
        <p>The task force called for Federal grants of $25 million a year for four years for full or partial purchase of threatened lands. To encourage landowners to sell to conservation groups instead of developers, the group recommended that the owners be excused from paying income taxes on the money they make from those sales. The group also proposed giving state tax credits to those who donate land to conservation groups.</p>
        <p>''The old, comfortable protection techniques of the past are not enough to insure forest conservation,'' Thomas C. Jorling, New York's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, said in a statement accompanying the release of the report. ''We must look for innovative new approaches to deal with the growing pressures on forest lands.''</p>
        <p>A coalition of 17 conservation groups praised the task force's proposals, describing them in a statement as ''a significant positive step toward taking substantive action to protect these vital lands.'' The conservationists also support a longer-term protection strategy using coordinated land-use planning and a bigger Federal role.</p>
        <p>The report coincided with one released by the United States Forest Service, which examined ownership and land use in the region. It offered 28 tax and acquisition strategies for use by Congress or the states to conserve environmental, recreational and economic interests in the forest.</p>
        <p>Uproar Over Land Sale</p>
        <p>Congress authorized the report, the Northern Forest Lands Study, in 1988 after a big industrial landowner, Diamond Occidental Forest Inc., put up for sale one million acres of forest land in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The sale created an uproar, prompting fears that cherished lands would be sold to developers for the building of vacation homes. Some of those fears were realized.</p>
        <p>''Changes in land ownership and use clearly threaten the long-term integrity and traditional uses of the land in parts of the study area,'' the Forest Service concluded.</p>
        <p>''As a result,'' it said, ''open space, forestry, farming and recreational uses of 22 million acres of private land in the northern forest are gradually giving way to residential and recreational development.''</p>
        <p>Similar conclusions were reached in a recently released study by the Governor's Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century. The commission, appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, recommended some of the approaches offered by the Forest Services and the governors' task force.</p>
        <p>But the New York commission went further than the other groups in proposing proportionately more land acquisition and greater state regulation, including a one-year building moratorium on 90 percent of Adirondack Park's privately held lands.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the four-state Governors' Task Force had trouble agreeing on some issues and solutions. In part, the differences reflected the New England states' longtime skepticism of government land ownership and regulation. New York has been more willing to use these conservation approaches.</p>
