        <p>It is human nature to push for new limits, to go to the very edge. There is no end in sight as, once again this month, records were set during qualifications.</p>
        <p>As a boy growing up in Indiana, the question of the ultimate speed, was the first issue I heard argued when racing resumed after World War II. That debate continues.</p>
        <p>Millions of Indy fans remember the signature of Sid Collins, the radio voice of the Greatest Spectacle in Racing for many years. His broadcast closing went something like this:</p>
        <p>Wherever in the world you are, the drivers, as always, drove for that elusive quest to be the fastest. On this day, (name of winner) was the first to cross the finish line.</p>
        <p>That still tells the story.</p>
