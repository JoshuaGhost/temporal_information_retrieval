        <p>The Federal Home Loan Bank System, a network of 12 regional banks that lend money to savings and loan associations, tapped the securities market yesterday with an $875 million offering at par of one-year and two-year bonds through various securities dealers.</p>
        <p>A $435 million issue of one-year bonds due in 1991 was priced to yield 8.375 percent, or about a basis point more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>The remaining $440 million in two-year bonds were priced to yield 8.60 percent, or about 7 basis points more than Treasuries. The dealers said the first interest payment for the one-year bond is Nov. 28 and the first for the two-year bond is Nov. 26.</p>
