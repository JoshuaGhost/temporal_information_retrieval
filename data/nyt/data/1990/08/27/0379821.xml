        <p>LEAD: As members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gathered informally here today to confront some of the most crucial issues in the group's 30-year history, some predicted that a formal meeting would be announced on Monday to address questions of oil production and prices.</p>
        <p>As members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gathered informally here today to confront some of the most crucial issues in the group's 30-year history, some predicted that a formal meeting would be announced on Monday to address questions of oil production and prices.</p>
        <p>But regardless of the forum, a majority of OPEC members expect at least three member nations to carry out their plan to raise oil production to help meet the supply shortfall caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.</p>
        <p>There is a growing sentiment here that the member nations would be better off to permit production increases within an OPEC framework instead of allowing a free-for-all that might be difficult to control once the Persian Gulf crisis is over. Once the conflict comes to an end, this logic holds, OPEC can retake control and regulate production under its quota system.</p>
        <p>While there are serious differences among members on how to respond to the turmoil in the world petroleum markets, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela are pressing to increase their production substantially when the meeting ends.</p>
        <p>Long-Dormant Animosities</p>
        <p>The Iraqi-Kuwaiti conflict has rekindled long-dormant animosities within OPEC that reflect the political schisms separating poor and rich countries and pro-Western and anti-Western nations.</p>
        <p>OPEC officials from Algeria, Libya, Iran, Nigeria and Iraq, for example, argue that it is not OPEC's mission to save the West from an economic crisis caused by rapidly rising oil prices. They say the West has done little for indebted third world nations in the last decade and argue that there is enough oil in world markets to compensate for the interruption of supplies caused by the Iraqi invasion.</p>
        <p>Delegates from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, however, say that unless OPEC allows members that can raise their output to do so immediately, OPEC itself will pay a high price if demand drops.</p>
        <p>These delegates say higher oil prices will eventually create a backlash as they have done in the past, when industrialized countries countered rising prices with conservation measures that reduced oil consumption.</p>
        <p>A number of member countries, including Indonesia, Algeria and Nigeria, seem to favor a middle ground in which OPEC would raise output to make up for only part of the shortages in the markets.</p>
        <p>Their view is that oil prices had been quite weak for a long time earlier this year, and higher prices now are needed to compensate for the earlier losses.</p>
        <p>A Fundamental Split</p>
        <p>But behind the issues of output and prices is a more fundamental split along political and ideological lines.</p>
        <p>Among the poorer, more militant members of OPEC, there is an unquestionable antipathy toward the United States and a conviction that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the prime advocates of higher production, are acting under strong American pressure.</p>
        <p>''We are not here to respond to the wishes of the Americans,'' said an Arab delegate from one of the militant countries. ''This is OPEC, and our mission is to serve the best interest of our members.''</p>
        <p>In an argument echoed by several moderate countries, including Nigeria and Indonesia, which are allies of the West, an OPEC official from Algeria said: ''There is no real shortage of oil in the market. If the American and Western oil companies release their stocks of oil instead of hanging on to them to make more money, there will be no shortage.''</p>
        <p>Advocates of this view say that even if OPEC now authorized all its members with surplus capacity to produce all the oil they could, this would not amount to the full four million barrels a day missing from Kuwait and Iraq.</p>
        <p>Delegate From Kuwait</p>
        <p>Among the delegates who gathered today, Kuwait's representative, Ali Khalifa al Sabah, the Finance Minister and a senior member of the Kuwaiti ruling family who has been an architect of OPEC policies for a decade, was greeted warmly by most other OPEC ministers.</p>
        <p>So far, there has been no sign of the Iraqis, who have indicated that they would wait for the meeting to be elevated into a formal session.</p>
        <p>The general sentiment here is that even if Iraq took part, it would not be able to prevent other OPEC members from raising output to compensate for the loss of the four million barrels of oil a day.</p>
        <p>In pressing their case for increased production, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela concede that international oil companies, the United States, Japan and Western European countries hold large stocks of oil that could be released to help make up for the shortfall.</p>
        <p>But they argue that these stocks are held by rich industrialized nations and that poorer third world countries, like India, Pakistan, Brazil and many African nations, which do not have stocks of oil, are experiencing a real shortage and are facing huge, untenable price increases.</p>
        <p>A Middle Ground</p>
        <p>One OPEC delegate, who is among those who are unable to raise production but strongly favor higher prices, advocates bargaining for a smaller increase in output by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. ''Perhaps something on the order of two million barrels instead of say 3.5 or so,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have said that under the existing OPEC agreement, which mandates the production of a total of 22.5 million barrels a day by all 13 members at a price of $21 a barrel, there is plenty of room to produce all they can now. Prices now stand at about $31 a barrel and production is substantially below 22.5 million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Some delegates are hoping that the talks do not raise emotions too high. Sadek Boussena, the OPEC conference president and Algeria's oil minister, said in an interview tonight on CNN: ''I have big hopes that all of us will try to remain calm and stay out of matters that do not concern us.''</p>
        <p>Making a Decision</p>
        <p>Mr. Boussena added, ''I think we have to make this decision in a way that allows all OPEC members not to consider this decision as against them.''</p>
        <p>The Algerian oil minister noted that the rise in oil prices is not something OPEC can remedy by itself.</p>
        <p>He and others have said psychology and market speculation are driving prices up and that these elements have little to do with how much oil is on the market or how much production is missing from Kuwait and Iraq.</p>
