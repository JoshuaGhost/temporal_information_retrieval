        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Has Donal Henahan lost his opera glasses? While there are certainly pros and cons to being able to see Wotan's dimples and other subtleties that were visible in the Metropolitan Opera's ''Ring'' broadcast [''Do We Really Need to See Wotan's Dimples?,'' July 1] , it hardly seems fair to discuss the matter without noting that audiences in the house have long used opera glasses for the express purpose of being able to focus in on facial and gestural details.</p>
        <p>Wanting to see what is really going on stage is perfectly understandable. True, what you see isn't always flattering. Costumes and makeup may look crude; somebody's often sweating. And with many singers you may be better off not knowing what they're doing (or failing to do) with their hands and faces. But whether or not a singer is acting well, acting is still part of the job. And with those singers who do have stage acting talents - Matti Salminen, the Met's Hagen, comes to mind - TV close-ups can add substantially to the value of the production, just as looking through the glasses can. For that matter, because of the limited resolution of the television image, close-ups of some degree or other may be the only way to convey even as much detail as you'd see from a decent seat without your opera glasses.</p>
        <p>I don't mean to suggest denying practical considerations. By all means give the most close-ups to those who use them best, and limit the damage done by those to whom the camera is not kind. But an opera broadcast without close-ups is a broadcast that shuts out one of the principal expressive dimensions of drama. If it means you see a few dimples, well, it's no worse than what you'd see through your opera glasses.</p>
