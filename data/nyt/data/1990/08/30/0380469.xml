        <p>LEAD: The Emergency Medical Service began taking trauma patients to the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center again yesterday, ending a five-day suspension.</p>
        <p>The Emergency Medical Service began taking trauma patients to the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center again yesterday, ending a five-day suspension.</p>
        <p>Thomas B. Doyle, the executive director of E.M.S., said an audit conducted after the suspension was imposed on Friday determined that the hospital was again ''capable of providing quality patient care to its trauma patients.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle did not comment on the reasons for the suspension.</p>
        <p>Standards for trauma centers are set by the American College of Surgeons and emergency medicine specialists. They require CAT scanners and other specialized equipment, 24-hour coverage in several kinds of surgery, an intensive-care unit and doctors who are trained in advanced emergency care.</p>
