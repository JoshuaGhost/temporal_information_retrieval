        <p>Ines Mendoza de Munoz, the widow of Luis Munoz Marin, the longtime Governor of Puerto Rico, died Monday at a hospital in Rio Piedras, a suburb of San Juan. She was 82 years old and lived in San Juan.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Commonwealth said she died of a heart attack.</p>
        <p>Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon declared an official three-day period of mourning and ordered flags at public sites to be flown at half-staff.</p>
        <p>Known widely and affectionately as Dona Ines, Mrs. Munoz was Puerto Rico's First Lady for the 16 years her husband was Governor. She was an early adherent to his Popular Democratic Party and married him in 1940. She was an active adviser to her husband and helped him begin ''Operation Bootstrap,'' the economic program that revitalized the Commonwealth's economy.</p>
        <p>A 1927 graduate of a school of education that is now part of the University of Puerto Rico and of Columbia University in 1931, she also had distinguished career as a schoolteacher.</p>
        <p>She is survived by two children from an earlier marriage, a son, Rafael Palacios and a daughter, Carmen Palacios de Ramirez, both of San Juan; two daughters from her second marriage, Senator Victoria Munoz Mendoza of San Juan and Viviana Munoz Mendoza of Boston; 14 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p>
