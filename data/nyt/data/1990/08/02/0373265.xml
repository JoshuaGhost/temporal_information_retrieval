        <p>LEAD: Japan agreed today to open up its telecommunications market further to foreign companies, meeting an Aug. 1 deadline for possible American retaliation, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>Japan agreed today to open up its telecommunications market further to foreign companies, meeting an Aug. 1 deadline for possible American retaliation, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>The tentative agreement, expected to be signed in Tokyo Thursday, should pave the way for American companies to win hundreds of millions of dollars of sales in Japan, they said.</p>
        <p>''This agreement represents an important step toward giving U.S. firms in Japan access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoy in the United States,'' the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said.</p>
        <p>What the Agreement Covers</p>
        <p>The agreement, reached in Tokyo after 13 days of talks, covers both telecommunications equipment and services.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hills said Japan agreed to liberalize its large and fast-growing market for such advanced telecommunications services as voice mail and electronic banking.</p>
        <p>The Japanese market in such services is estimated at about $700 million per year now and American officials estimate that it could grow to close to $2.5 billion by 1994.</p>
        <p>Tokyo pledged to simplify regulations so that it would be easier for foreign companies to enter the market, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>American companies will be able to communicate electronically - internally, among affiliates and with regular customers and suppliers - essentially free of regulation.</p>
        <p>''As a result, U.S. manufacturing, financial and other firms that do business with Japan should be able to run those operations more easily and economically,'' Mrs. Hills said.</p>
        <p>Also under the agreement, American companies will be able to sell network channel terminating equipment directly in Japan, rather than having to go through Japanese companies like the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation.</p>
        <p>Network channel terminating equipment acts like a modem to connect computers to digital telephone networks. $150 Million Market ''Industry sources estimate that the U.S. share of Japan's market could be at least $150 million annually,'' Mrs. Hills said.</p>
        <p>She said Japan also promised to enact safeguards against anticompetitive conduct in the telecommunications services sector.</p>
        <p>''These agreements will play a growing role in maintaining the competitiveness of American firms in providing benefits for consumers worldwide,'' Mrs. Hills said.</p>
