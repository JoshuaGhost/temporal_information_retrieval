        <p>LEAD: To combat what they consider anti-student legislation passed by city and county officials, the Student Government Association at the University of Maryland has registered more than 800 students this year to vote in the fall county and state elections. And the president of the association, Daniel Cones, vows that it will continue its efforts.</p>
        <p>To combat what they consider anti-student legislation passed by city and county officials, the Student Government Association at the University of Maryland has registered more than 800 students this year to vote in the fall county and state elections. And the president of the association, Daniel Cones, vows that it will continue its efforts.</p>
        <p>Currently there are about 24,000 residents in College Park, almost half of whom are students, including 3,000 living off campus. But, according to the January city statistics, only 7,800 residents were registered to vote.</p>
        <p>The College Park City Council supported legislation that limits the number of students living together based on bedroom size and availability of parking. Students contend the Council has also reduced the impact of their votes by changing voting boundaries in the spring of 1989 and by requiring them to register 90 days before primary and general elections.</p>
        <p>Many out-of-town students do not return from their hometowns after summer vacations soon enough to register locally, they charge.</p>
        <p>Several students filed suit in a Federal court in Baltimore last August to demand that the Council redraw voting district lines. The case is expected to go to trial in mid-November.</p>
        <p>'Lump Us All Together'</p>
        <p>''The Council wanted to reduce the power of the student vote, and the easiest way to do that is to lump us all together in one district,'' said Michael Smith, a freshman computer science major and a plaintiff in the suit.</p>
        <p>''We only have one seat on the Council, and the rest of the city has the other seven, while the Census Bureau says that we are clearly half the residents,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>''We are a school with a significant voting block,'' Mr. Cones said. ''If we don't vote, it enables the councils to do things to us.''</p>
        <p>Some local politicians have encouraged students to register and vote.</p>
        <p>''It's imperative that students become involved in the fight for their rights,'' said County Councilman Lloyd Wilson, a candidate for county executive.</p>
        <p>The president of the College Park campus, William Kirwan, said that housing limitations should apply to all residents, not just students, and that a lawmaker should take the whole community into consideration, not just students or residents.</p>
        <p>''I believe the students can have an impact on the elections, and if they vote it could give students a better voice in certain matters,'' Mr. Kirwan said in a recent news conference. ''But,'' he added, ''while students' concerns need to be taken into consideration, I wouldn't want to imply that we shouldn't have codes which may limit student activities to protect the living environment.''</p>
