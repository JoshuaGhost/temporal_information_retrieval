        <p>The Foster Grant Corporation, the maker of sunglasses, filed for protection from its creditors on Thursday under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. In the filing in Tucson, Ariz., it reported total assets of about $25 million and liabilities of about $36 million, including nearly $19.3 million in unsecured debt. Foster Grant, founded in 1919 by Sam Foster, was the first company to use abrasion-resistant lens coatings that blocked the sun's ultraviolet rays. The company said it sold more than $50 million worth of sunglasses, eyeglasses and related lens products in 1989, when total retail sales of nonprescription sunglasses in the United States was $1.7 billion.</p>
