        <p>York, who was called up from the Pirates' Buffalo farm club to take some pressure off the Pittsburgh pitching staff during a spate of doubleheaders, gave up six hits but no runs in the first game of a doubleheader Friday night. The outing was good enough to prompt Manager Jim Leyland to reconsider, but not ultimatelty to alter, his plans to use the 25-year-old pitcher for just one game and then to recall Orlando Merced, a first baseman and oufielder who appeared in 17 games for the Pirates before being sent to Buffalo on July 25.</p>
        <p>York was sent back to Buffalo yesterday, but is not expected to mope. He's getting married there tomorrow night. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
