        <p>LEAD: Going all the way back to 1823, the Monroe Doctrine has been invoked at the slightest suggestion of outside interference on the American continent.</p>
        <p>Going all the way back to 1823, the Monroe Doctrine has been invoked at the slightest suggestion of outside interference on the American continent.</p>
        <p>However, no gunboats were sent steaming along the coastline two weeks ago when a foreign power took an interest in an election being held in the contemporary mecca of America, Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>There was nothing Mickey Mouse about the world soccer body helping to elect an insurgent candidate, Alan Rothenberg, as the new president of the United States Soccer Federation. This was big business.</p>
        <p>It was not exactly a coup financed by a secret intelligence agency, but it had its share of dawn telephone calls and suggestions that the ruling party be overthrown.</p>
        <p>At stake was the sporting image of the United States, which has been awarded the World Cup of soccer for 1994. After the recent dreary, low-scoring World Cup in Italy, more Americans than ever are raising their voices and saying they never did like that game, anyway.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, assuming we haven't all bombed and gassed each other back to the stone age by 1994, Germans and Brazilians and Koreans and, yes, even Iraqis will be sitting in front of the tube watching how the Yanks handle their first World Cup.</p>
        <p>Until Aug. 5, American soccer had been in the hands of the people who played and loved the game, mostly the so-called ethnics of the older cities like Werner Fricker, a European-born businessman from Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>However, this mom-and-pop operation falls under the auspices of the Federation Internationale de Football Association, known to fearful referees, cowed players, submissive leagues, obedient sponsors and servile national federations as FIFA.</p>
        <p>FIFA strikes fear, not with poisoned umbrellas or wily Mata Haris but with blunt country-hardball politics. It has overpowered the International Olympic Committee, keeping its best professionals out of the Summer Games, insuring that the World Cup will always be the true championship of soccer.</p>
        <p>Beyond the giant yellow FAIR PLAY cards it displays, FIFA's double purpose is to spread soccer to heathen nations and to make money, tons of it. With attendance dying in Brazil and dwindling in Europe, FIFA needs a new frontier, El Dorado Nuevo.</p>
        <p>Because of warm memories of 100,000 fans streaming into the Rose Bowl for the soccer finals of the 1984 Summer Games, FIFA awarded the 1994 World Cup to the United States only to discover it had made the business equivalent of turning over the catering of a formal dinner party to a hot-dog vendor.</p>
        <p>Horrified at a modest television contract for 1994, FIFA ordered the bidding to be reopened, an absolute embarrassment to the American federation. FIFA then developed an antipathy to Paul Stiehl, who had been organizing the 1994 effort, leading to the appointment of Scott Parks LeTellier. Stiehl then announced himself as an opposition candidate against Fricker.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just FIFA that had a problem with the U.S.S.F. At a recent soccer symposium, Hank Steinbrecher, an official with Gatorade, said, ''The United States Soccer Federation is full of nice people, but they're generally an amateur organization.''</p>
        <p>One does not want to portray corporations as philanthropies, eager to give money to a sweet little game. The World Cup in the United States could mean millions of dollars for corporations like adidas, the sporting goods company recently bought by Bernard Tapie, the owner of the Marseilles soccer team. These are serious people who want to feel they are dealing with serious federations.</p>
        <p>When Fricker made a few arrogant public appearances in Italy, FIFA hinted at appointing a delegate to the World Cup effort, but Fricker did not take the hint. We all know what happens, in the old intrigue movies, to leaders who become inappropriate.</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks before the election, there was a new candidate: Rothenberg, who is just finishing his term as president of the California Bar Association and who had organized the soccer portion at the 1984 Summer Games under Peter Ueberroth. We shall wait to see if it was mere coincidence that Ueberroth recently became a consultant to adidas with an option to buy into the company.</p>
        <p>Taking no chances, at dawn of the federation election, FIFA had one of its top people, Guido Tognoni, make a phone call asking Stiehl to withdraw. Instead, Stiehl went public, probably making it a bit difficult for him to get good seats for the 1994 finals.</p>
        <p>Nobody invoked the Monroe Doctrine as the delegates overwhelmingly voted Rothenberg into office. Winning the election was the easy part. Improvement will be harder.  Rothenberg's first step should be to complete Fricker's laudable overture to Franz Beckenbauer to work for the federation, in whatever capacity the Kaiser wants. If Costa Rica and Cameroon and Ireland can upgrade their game with outsider expertise, so should the United States.</p>
        <p>Besides, with FIFA keeping an eye on things, there is no such thing as an an outsider. It is a small world, and getting smaller.</p>
