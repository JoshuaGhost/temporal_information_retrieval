        <p>LEAD: A dying institution of government will conduct its own last rites in a marathon session to start tomorrow. In the process, New York City's Board of Estimate can improve - or obstruct - the life of the city it has managed for 92 years. Dozens of items are on the agenda for its last meeting; four in particular will determine how the board, and its members, are remembered.</p>
        <p>A dying institution of government will conduct its own last rites in a marathon session to start tomorrow. In the process, New York City's Board of Estimate can improve - or obstruct - the life of the city it has managed for 92 years. Dozens of items are on the agenda for its last meeting; four in particular will determine how the board, and its members, are remembered.</p>
        <p>The board symbolizes the city in a literal way: it was the governmental invention under which the five boroughs joined together in 1898. Nevertheless, Federal courts have ruled that it violates the principle of one person one vote. Hence the board meeting tomorrow will be its last. As of Sept. 1, the City Council takes over.</p>
        <p>The most important power left to the board is the power not to leave a mess. That's true most notably for four issues involving orderly development and land use:</p>
        <p>Hunters Point. Three public agencies want to develop this vast site in Queens, across the East River from the United Nations. They have already won unanimous Planning Commission approval, despite the opposition of the local community board. The public development agencies propose creating 6,000 apartments and at least 20 acres of park, opening to a new promenade along the river.</p>
        <p>The $2.3 billion plan would immensely improve the deteriorating, predominantly industrial site. Private investors have indicated serious interest but it would only be reasonable for them to get cold feet if they had to start months of governmental reviews al over again. That makes Board of Estimate approval pivotal.</p>
        <p>Arverne. Three decades of bickering have followed city acquisition of this 300-acre oceanfront site in the Rockaways, also in Queens. Now private developers propose, at an estimated cost of $2.3 billion, to build 10,000 low-rise apartments and small homes in 10 years. The Planning Commission has approved the proposal. It warrants endorsement from the Board of Estimate.</p>
        <p>City and Suburban Homes. Peter Kalikow, real estate developer and publisher of The New York Post, wishes to build an apartment tower along the East River between 78th and 79th Streets. But lamentably, the Landmarks Commission insists the present buildings deserve protection as a landmark. Though local residents may dislike modern development, the commission has no authority to take that opinion into account.</p>
        <p>The existing development, and another built by the same philanthropic developer 15 blocks away, are coupled in the landmark designation. They have neither the architectural, social or historical interest to justify landmark status. It is the Board of Estimate's clear duty to remove it.</p>
        <p>Audubon Ballroom. A proposal to energize northern Manhattan and honor Malcolm X could collapse before it even reaches the board. It is still scheduled to vote on Columbia University's plan to build a biomedical research center on the site of the old Audubon Ballroom, where the Black Muslim leader was murdered in 1965. Under the $34 million proposal, a Dinkins administration compromise, Columbia would preserve a section of the Audubon as a memorial to Malcolm.</p>
        <p>But Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, siding with those who want to save more of the building, has vetoed $8.1 million in funding, dooming the project. She would serve her borough by rescinding her veto and letting the Board of Estimate, for the last time, represent all New York City.</p>
