        <p>Does New York State's social studies curriculum fairly reflect the nation's racial and cultural diversity? The question has produced passionate political response. Sensibly, the State Board of Regents has now approved a committee of teachers, administrators and scholars who can offer a scholarly answer.</p>
        <p>The issue of multiculturalism in the curriculum arose in July 1989 when the State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, asked a task force to examine the teaching of racial and ethnic issues. The panel asserted that minorities had ''been the victims of an intellectual and educational oppression,'' and that their contributions had been ''marginalized'' by a pro-Western, pro-European bias.</p>
        <p>That and other language in the report struck many scholars as racist and political. Chastened, Mr. Sobol promised to appoint another committee to review state guidelines for teaching American history and global studies. Its task would be to see whether and how the syllabus ought to be revised to broaden student understanding of America's cultural diversity and racial experience.</p>
        <p>The Board of Regents has now approved a credible committee of 23 members drawn from elementary, secondary and higher education. Among the members are Nathan Glazer, professor of education at Harvard; Edmund Gordon, professor of African-American studies at Yale, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., historian and professor of humanities at the City University of New York.</p>
        <p>The members represent contrasting political views. But this group is more likely to be attentive to scholarship than the original panel. Making sure that students understand America's complexity is a worthy goal, but best achieved dispassionately.</p>
