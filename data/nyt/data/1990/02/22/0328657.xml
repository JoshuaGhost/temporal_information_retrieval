        <p>LEAD: The dollar ended mostly higher in thin, nervous trading yesterday after a mixed performance overseas.</p>
        <p>The dollar ended mostly higher in thin, nervous trading yesterday after a mixed performance overseas.</p>
        <p>On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $418 an ounce, down $1.90 from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $417.80 an ounce, off $2.10.</p>
        <p>The dollar started out higher in Japan, but it fell back in Europe as dealers became unnerved by falling stock prices in Tokyo and a bond market rally in West Germany. Those worries, however, failed to have a big impact on traders in New York.</p>
        <p>No Incentive</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's any incentive to buy or sell,'' said Earl I. Johnson of the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''The market needs more information on the U.S. economy.</p>
        <p>The dollar had little reaction to a Government report showing a 1.1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index for January, Increased inflation reduces prospects for lower interest rates, which would usually depress the dollar, dealers said.</p>
        <p>They said the market had anticipated higher inflation when the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified before Congress on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In New York, the dollar traded at 1.6725 marks, up from 1.66835 marks on Tuesday, and 145.50 yen, up from 145.155 yen. The pound cost $1.7125, up from $1.7115.</p>
        <p>Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4795 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785; 5.6730 French francs, up from 5.6670; 1,238.00 Italian lire, up from 1,237.50, and 1.19825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20075.</p>
        <p>Silver prices slipped, with silver for current delivery closing at $5.272 an ounce, down from $5.332 Tuesday. Silver fell 2 cents in London, to $5.33 an ounce.</p>
