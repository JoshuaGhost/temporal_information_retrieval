        <p>LEAD: The mock crisis went this way: Shortly after 2 A.M. on Sunday, the Security Council's 15 members were roused from their beds here for an emergency session to review the worsening situation in Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>The mock crisis went this way: Shortly after 2 A.M. on Sunday, the Security Council's 15 members were roused from their beds here for an emergency session to review the worsening situation in Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>President Daniel Ortega Saavedra had declared an emergency and canceled elections next week after several United Nations observers were killed. American forces in Panama were moving northward into Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>But by 9 A.M. an exhausted Council had accomplished little, with the United States blocking condemnation of its action and members unable to agree on a role for the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''Frustrating but realistic,'' said Marc S. Sabartini, a Harvard biochemistry student playing the role of Secretary General at this 36th annual Harvard National Model United Nations, the largest in the country.</p>
        <p>Uncanny Realism</p>
        <p>For three days, about 1,800 students from more than 140 American, Canadian and Mexican universities transformed a hotel here into a mini-United Nations, organizing meetings of the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice, among other bodies.</p>
        <p>Each university, fielding teams of about 18 students, pretended to be a country - the University of Western Ontario was the United States this year while Siena College in Loudonville, N. Y., played the Soviet Union - first studying its policies and interests and then promoting them in the United Nations forums.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was uncannily realistic, with student-delegates rushing in and out of meeting rooms.</p>
        <p>The concluding General Assembly called for a compulsory public register of international arms sales, said assets of drug traffickers should finance the anti-drug war and asked the United Nations to also help internally displaced refugees.</p>
        <p>Only occasionally did delegates stretch the bounds of political probability, as when Turkey (the State University of New York at New Paltz) resolved the Cyprus crisis by withdrawing its forces in a bargain with Greece (Kean College of New Jersey in Union) that allowed it to join the European Community.</p>
        <p>''What talent for compromise, what grace they treat each other with,'' said Jonathan Moore, an American deputy representative at the real United Nations, and a guest at the meeting.</p>
        <p>The Harvard Model United Nations is one of about 150 such meetings organized each year by high schools and universities around the world. Harvard takes credit for the idea, having organized the first Model League of Nations in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>Teachers who brought their students to the Harvard meeting said the experience encourages debating skills besides teaching them a global approach to current problems and providing an insight into the complexity of international relations.</p>
        <p>''It breaks down American parochialism,'' said Thomas Ilger of Pitzer College in Claremont Calif., whose students represented Britain.</p>
        <p>But best lesson of all for the real United Nations was the speaking time allowed: a maximum of just two and half minutes per speaker.</p>
