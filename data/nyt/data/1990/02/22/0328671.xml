        <p>LEAD: Texas Instruments Inc. said today that its wafer fabrication plant here had made the company's first computer memory chip capable of storing 16 million bits of information.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments Inc. said today that its wafer fabrication plant here had made the company's first computer memory chip capable of storing 16 million bits of information.</p>
        <p>The announcement came eight days after the International Business Machines Corporation announced that it had developed a similar chip prototype, indicating that Texas Instruments' chip technology is roughly even with that of I.B.M.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts said I.B.M. and Texas Instruments were in a close race with Japanese chip makers in the technology for the 16-million-bit chip. The chip can store four times as much data as the most advanced chip now on the market. The new chip is expected to be sold in large quantities in four years, they said.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments produced its chip with research scientists at Hitachi Ltd. of Japan. The companies created an alliance in 1988 to share rising development costs in technology for dynamic random access memories. I.B.M. produced its chip prototype without a partner.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Texas Instruments stressed that its new chip was a test device that would be used in designing a high-volume manufacturing process. It said it was continuing work with Hitachi on the project, but would not discuss Hitachi's activities. Texas Instruments also declined to say when it would produce the new chip in large quantities.</p>
        <p>Texas Instruments shares rose 37.5 cents today, to $32.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
