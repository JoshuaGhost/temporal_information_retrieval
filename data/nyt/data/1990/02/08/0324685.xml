        <p>LEAD: An appeals court ruled yesterday that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority can enforce its anti-begging rule in the subways while it appeals a lower court's decision that the rule is unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>An appeals court ruled yesterday that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority can enforce its anti-begging rule in the subways while it appeals a lower court's decision that the rule is unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>The 2-1 decision by the 2d U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also means the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey can enforce similar panhandling prohibitions at the World Trade Center and Port Authority Bus Terminal during the appeal.</p>
        <p>The two agencies are appealing a Jan. 25 injunction issued by Judge Leonard Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan that barred them from enforcing the rules. Judge Sand said begging could not be banned because it is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand had issued a partial stay on the injunction last week, saying that during the appeal, the M.T.A. could ban begging in certain areas like subway cars and within 25 feet of token booths.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand's injunction stemmed from a class-action lawsuit brought in November by the Legal Action Committee for the Homeless on behalf of all homeless and needy people who beg in the subways and the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>In oral arguments yesterday, M.T.A. lawyer Susan Weiner said the agency would suffer irreparable harm if it could not enforce in full its anti-begging rule. Ms. Weiner said riders feel intimidated by panhandlers.</p>
