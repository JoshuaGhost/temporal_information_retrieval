        <p>LEAD: The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that profits fell nearly 33 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989 but rose almost 4 percent for the year, a third consecutive record.</p>
        <p>The Dow Chemical Company said yesterday that profits fell nearly 33 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989 but rose almost 4 percent for the year, a third consecutive record.</p>
        <p>Net income for the quarter fell to $427 million, or $1.59 a share, from $635 million, or $2.29 a share, in the fourth quarter in 1988. Sales fell to $4.26 billion from $4.3 billion.</p>
        <p>Net income for the year rose to $2.49 billion, or $9.20 a share, from $2.4 billion, or $8.51 a share, in 1988. Sales rose to a record $17.6 billion from the former record of $16.68 billion in 1988.</p>
        <p>Earnings per share reflect a 3-for-2 stock split two months ago.</p>
        <p>Frank P. Popoff, president and chief executive of the company, which is based in Midland, Mich., said that while 1990 would be ''another excellent year,'' he did not expect record earnings.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange, Dow fell $1.75 a share, to $63.875.</p>
        <p>Mr. Popoff said that demand remained strong but that a 9 percent decline in the price of some chemicals from record levels a year earlier depressed fourth-quarter profits.</p>
        <p>The cost of integrating new businesses and new products and maintenance costs at a European plant were other factors in the decline, he said.</p>
        <p>A new farm-products venture, between Dow and Eli Lilly &amp; Company, and the merger last December between Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Marion Laboratories were included in fourth-quarter results.</p>
        <p>Without them, Mr. Popoff said, Dow's sales rose 5 percent in both the quarter and the year from the year-earlier periods. He added that Dow's operating rate fell slightly, to 90 percent in the quarter, from 91 percent the year before.</p>
