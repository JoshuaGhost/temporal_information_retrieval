        <p>LEAD: The Ford Motor Company, which has said it will improve its light-truck lineup, said today that it was in talks with the Mazda Motor Corporation about jointly building a new compact pickup truck.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company, which has said it will improve its light-truck lineup, said today that it was in talks with the Mazda Motor Corporation about jointly building a new compact pickup truck.</p>
        <p>A Ford spokesman declined to say specifically when the potential vehicle might be produced, but said it would be in the 1990's. He added that Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker, favored a production site in the United States.</p>
        <p>The trade publication Automotive News, citing Ford planning documents, said the vehicle would be available in the 1995 model year to replace the Ford Ranger model. Ford currently produces Ranger compact pickups at a plant in Louisville, Ky. Mazda, which is about 25 percent owned by Ford, exports pickups to the United States.</p>
        <p>The Automotive News report, which quoted Alex Trotman, an executive vice president of Ford, said the venture would be comparable with an arrangement between the companies at Mazda's assembly plant at Flat Rock, Mich.</p>
        <p>Mazda operates that factory, which produces the Ford Probe sports coupe as well as Mazda's MX-6 and 626 compact cars. Crain Communicationsd (automotive news)</p>
