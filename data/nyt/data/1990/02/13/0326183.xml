        <p>LEAD: The speed with which Federal regulators responded to financial problems at Drexel Burnham Lambert's parent illustrates their awareness of how quickly problems at this particular Wall Street firm could spread through the complex structure of today's financial markets.</p>
        <p>The speed with which Federal regulators responded to financial problems at Drexel Burnham Lambert's parent illustrates their awareness of how quickly problems at this particular Wall Street firm could spread through the complex structure of today's financial markets.</p>
        <p>The focus of their concern was the ''junk bond'' market, a corner of Wall Street that Drexel invented and still sustains. More politely known as ''high risk, high yield'' securities, junk bonds are the debt of companies considered too young, too small, or too shaky to sell their bonds to traditional lenders.</p>
        <p>What Drexel made popular was the notion that, provided the interest rate was high enough, even such speculative offerings could be a sound investment, particularly if investors sought safety in an assortment of such issues. Some borrowers would go broke, the theory conceded, but the extra-high interest paid by those that did not would more than make up the difference.</p>
        <p>Widely Held Securities</p>
        <p>Drexel's theory - together with the firm's willingness to foster trading and confidence by standing ready to buy or sell such bonds - underlay the growth of a $200 billion market. Junk bonds are now counted among the assets of scores of perfectly conventional pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and tottering savings and loan institutions, With signs of trouble at Drexel -still the dominant junk bond firm -regulators clearly wanted to make sure that other firms do not pull back in panic from this already-fragile marketplace.</p>
        <p>In the last six months, one company after another has stumbled under the burden of interest payments it took on when it sold junk bonds, with unsettling effects for scores of companies. Those problems, culminating in the unraveling of the Campeau Corporation's vast retailing empire last month, have made potential lenders more wary and potential borrowers more nervous. Their fear has permeated the credit markets.</p>
        <p>Beyond the impact on corporate America, as junk bonds drop in value, so does the wealth of those who own them. Scores of institutions and investors could be left less able to weather economic shocks. Last week, for instance, many insurance companies saw their stocks tumble in value because of the market's concern about their holdings of junk bonds. And thrift institutions, themselves no paragon of strength, could be severely hurt if the junk market weakens further.</p>
        <p>''Drexel may not be a household word to the average American,'' Gary Schilling, a Wall Street economist, said yesterday, ''but people are aware of the stock market, and they know that the market is built on confidence. God didn't set the price of General Motors stock; that price is set in the marketplace. And if there are problems with Wall Street, people could decide that the price should instantly be $20 cheaper.''</p>
        <p>Timing Called Unfortunate</p>
        <p>''This couldn't have happened at a worse time,'' Mr. Schilling added, ''because we are so dependent on the rest of the world to finance our deficits. So the regulators could see that it is imperative that the rest of the world should continue to have confidence in us and in our markets.''</p>
        <p>While the speed of the regulators' reaction illustrates how seriously Drexel's troubles were taken, the nature of that response seemed to show that Washington and Wall Street had learned the lessons of the October 1987 market crash: The Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange responded in close coordination.</p>
        <p>As news spread yesterday of financial troubles at Drexel, officials at the S.E.C., the Fed and the Big Board apparently did not wait to see how the markets would react. The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange was on the phone with reassuring words to the heads of major brokerage firms. The Federal Reserve had similar conversations with top bankers, one top Wall Street executive said last night.</p>
        <p>''This was a well-rehearsed contingency plan, far more so than in 1987,'' the executive said. ''They were reaching out to every nook and cranny where an exposure to Drexel's problems might exist.''</p>
        <p>There were many such crevices. As rumors of trouble at Drexel swept through the market yesterday, people who were parties to transactions with Drexel became worried about completing those deals. ''Unless the regulators step in,'' another executive explained, ''people move to protect their own interests. What happens is, you have rumors, you have panic, and, by definition, a lot of allegations arise that are not true.''</p>
        <p>Rumors Compete With News</p>
        <p>Yesterday's scene at the stock exchange was a telling example. At the opening bell, traders were passing around an ominous, and inaccurate, rumor that a major brokerage house was going to file for bankruptcy protection. When the report about Drexel's problems moved across the traders' screens, they seemed to find the news less alarming than the rumors, and selling pressure began to ease. But as uncertainty grew about the extent of Drexel's problems, the market closed nearly 30 points lower.</p>
        <p>Given the quick response by regulators, it remains to be seen how serious a threat Drexel's problems pose to the markets. A lot depends on whether other firms step in and absorb the leading role that Drexel has played in trading junk bonds. Without that liquidity - the ability of the market to absorb selling without a price collapse - there is really no floor under the value of billions of dollars in speculative bonds.</p>
        <p>''It's not a financial panic; it is not a broad market event,'' said another executive, who declined to be named. ''But there are fragilities in the junk bond market.'' Underwriters tend to focus their buying and selling in the issues that they sponsored, and Drexel sponsored more than any other. The key, he said, will be for the regulators to get other firms to broaden their trading beyond the bond issues that they brought to market.</p>
