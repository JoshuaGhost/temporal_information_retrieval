        <p>GREAT BLACK RUSSIAN: A Novel on the Life and Times of Alexander Pushkin. By John Oliver Killens. (Wayne State University, $22.95.) How did it happen that Alexander Pushkin, descendant of an Ethiopian prince known as ''the Negro of Peter the Great,'' came to be the most brilliant poet of the Russian language? A mystery of genius, according to the novelist and scholar John Oliver Killens, in which Pushkin's African heritage was as enigmatic an influence as his mother's withheld love and his lifelong sense of identification with the lowly peasants of the Russian steppes. Killens's novel is admirable for finally giving weight to the 19th-century poet's fascination with his African lineage, an element of his biography largely ignored by Pushkin scholars. And yet, its maladroit title notwithstanding, ''Great Black Russian'' admirably avoids any polemics about race, dealing with the firebrand poet as the complex, puzzling character he was. Here is Pushkin the man, the writer, the African, the Russian, the aristocrat, the revolutionary, the womanizer and the husband. In wildly erratic but somehow mesmerizing prose, Killens (who died in 1987, shortly after completing this novel) takes us from Pushkin's youth, first as an unloved child and then a debauched teen-ager, through his young manhood as a revolutionary poet idolized by the people and exiled by a threatened Czar, to the prime of his productivity, his restricted life at the imperial court, his ill-conceived marriage and his death in a duel in 1837. The book can be maddening, juxtaposing powerful passages like a description of mass baptismal rites on the frozen Neva River with painful, cliche-ridden sex scenes, but it manages nonetheless to capture the essence of Pushkin's greatness - that he was a man who loved his people enough to give them a voice.</p>
