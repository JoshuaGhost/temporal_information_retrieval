        <p>LEAD: When the Exxon Valdez left the port of Valdez one night last March, her crew included a timid helmsman, a second mate who may have had mental problems and a captain with a history of drinking, according to testimony at the trial here of Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood.</p>
        <p>When the Exxon Valdez left the port of Valdez one night last March, her crew included a timid helmsman, a second mate who may have had mental problems and a captain with a history of drinking, according to testimony at the trial here of Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood.</p>
        <p>As the prosecution ended the second week of its presentation Friday and prepared to complete its case, a picture emerged of a cohesive navigational team strengthened by educated and experienced officers, but weakened by a troubled few.</p>
        <p>Questions were raised in court about the skipper's drinking, his knowledge of the crew and his judgment in leaving the bridge in the hands of others for a maneuver that required care.</p>
        <p>Did he know that Robert Kagan, the man at the helm, was known to have problems with steering? Did he rely too much on the veteran third mate, Gregory T. Cousins? And, once the ship was grounded on Bligh Reef, did Captain Hazelwood try a dangerous maneuver in an effort to rock her off?</p>
        <p>Jury Will Scrutinize Actions</p>
        <p>The jury in Anchorage Superior Court must decide whether any of Captain Hazelwood's actions constituted the reckless behavior with which he is charged.</p>
        <p>Captain Hazelwood, a 43-year-old veteran seaman from Huntington, L.I., and the only person prosecuted as a result of the nation's worst oil spill, is charged with second-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, the negligent discharge of oil, and operating a vessel while intoxicated.</p>
        <p>The grounding of the 987-foot Exxon Valdez resulted in a spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound, killing birds, fish and other wildlife and coating hundreds of miles of rocky coast.</p>
        <p>As crew members took the witness stand this week, their struggle to remain loyal to the captain while testifying against him was evident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cousins, who was in charge of the ship when she ran aground, blamed the helmsman, Mr. Kagan, for failing to follow Mr. Cousins's orders to steer hard a-starboard at a point where, the witness said, doing so would have allowed the tanker to miss the reef. ''I think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the command,'' Mr. Cousins said.</p>
        <p>Crewman Says Captain Was Calm</p>
        <p>The third mate credited Captain Hazelwood with being calm and clearly in command after the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kagan conceded under oath that he had become timid about steering because he had once been accused of ''chasing the compass'' - oversteering a ship.</p>
        <p>James Kunkel, the chief mate, a graduate of the Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, L.I., and a 20-year veteran of the seas, suggested that the skipper knew or should have known that Mr. Kagan was the weak link.</p>
        <p>''I mentioned I'd sailed with him before and I thought he needed extra supervision and extra practice in steering,'' Mr. Kunkel said, recalling a conversation he said he had once had with Captain Hazelwood. He said Mr. Kagan had been unable to perform even the simplest tasks without being watched. Once, he said that he assigned Mr. Kagan to paint a bulkhead but that he knew he would have to keep an eye on him to make sure he used the right paint and brush.</p>
        <p>Yet, Mr. Kunkel credited Captain Hazelwood with keeping everyone calm and said the captain had made prudent decisions in the wake of the grounding.</p>
        <p>'Keep an Eye on Him'</p>
        <p>The second mate, Lloyd LeCain, said he had assessed Mr. Kagan's capabilities as slightly below normal. ''I talked to Captain Hazelwood about it,'' he testified. ''He knew he had a problem. He told me to keep an eye on him when he was steering.''</p>
        <p>Captain Hazelwood's defense team immediately attacked Mr. LeCain's credibility, telling Judge Karl Johnstone that Mr. LeCain was on leave from Exxon for mental problems. They asked that the jury be told that Mr. LeCain had boasted of being a submarine commander in the Falklands, a Green Beret in Vietnam and a figure in the Iran-contra affair.</p>
        <p>Dick Madson, a defense lawyer, said that when Captain Hazelwood left his ship after the accident, Mr. LeCain approached the captain, declared that he was ''Ninja-trained'' and said he had two cyanide pills in case the skipper needed to commit suicide.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnstone ruled that the jury should not hear these allegations because they were confusing and constituted ''character evidence'' not permitted under Alaska law.</p>
        <p>For Captain Hazelwood, who has a history of drunken-driving convictions and is accused of being intoxicated on the night of the accident, one contention made by every crew member was important: They said the captain seemed sober and in command after the accident. They also said they had not smelled alcohol on his breath.</p>
        <p>Blood and urine tests taken about 10 hours after the accident detected alcohol in his system, and a Coast Guard investigator has said that he had smelled liquor on Captain Hazelwood's breath.</p>
