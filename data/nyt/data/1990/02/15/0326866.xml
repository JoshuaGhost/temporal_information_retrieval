        <p>LEAD: World trade negotiators agreed today on a plan of action to liberalize trade in the $100 billion tropical products market, ending months of stalemate.</p>
        <p>World trade negotiators agreed today on a plan of action to liberalize trade in the $100 billion tropical products market, ending months of stalemate.</p>
        <p>The agreement clears the way for a new accord to reduce import barriers and duties on products like nuts, coffee and spices. The agreement would be signed when the current round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ends in December.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, each GATT member has to submit proposals for eliminating or reducing its own tariffs and non-tariff measures to the Geneva-based secretariat by March 15. Negotiators will then meet in April to discuss whether the various proposals go far enough.</p>
        <p>When the four-year Uruguay Round was begun in Punta del Este in 1986, governments agreed to consider eliminating duties on unprocessed tropical products, abolishing or cutting duties on semiprocessed and processed products and eliminating or cutting quotas and other non-tariff measures.</p>
        <p>A new accord on free trade in tropical products is regarded as vital by third world countries, many of which are dependent on export earnings from these commodities.</p>
        <p>GATT is the main international forum for sponsoring trade negotiations. Its 96 members account for about four-fifths of world trade.</p>
