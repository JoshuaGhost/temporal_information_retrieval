        <p>Tony Conigliaro, who died of pneumonia and kidney failure Saturday eight years after suffering a near-fatal heart attack that had left him an invalid, was remembered here today as a local boy who played the outfield and was a home run hitter for the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>About 300 people attended the service at St. Anthony's Church, where Conigliaro was baptized 45 years ago. The mourners included Conigliaro's mother, Teresa; his brothers, Billy and Richie; his former teammates Dick Radatz, Mike Andrews and Jerry Moses; Johnny Pesky, Conigliaro's first manager with the Red Sox; the current Boston manager, Joe Morgan, and John Volpe, former Governor of Massachusetts.
