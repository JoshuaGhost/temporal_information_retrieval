        <p>LEAD: A judge dismissed a felony child abuse complaint against a pregnant woman who drank alcohol, saying the state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been injured.</p>
        <p>A judge dismissed a felony child abuse complaint against a pregnant woman who drank alcohol, saying the state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been injured.</p>
        <p>The judge, Robert Denhardt, ruled after hearing a doctor's testimony that it could take years to determine if the drinking had injured the fetus.</p>
        <p>''The key as I see it is that the child already has to have suffered,'' the judge said Thursday.</p>
        <p>The woman, Diane Pfannenstiel, 29 years old, was about four months pregnant when she was arrested Jan. 4, two months after another judge ordered her to remain alcohol-free to protect the fetus. A blood test disclosed that she had a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent, the level at which a person is considered intoxicated under state law.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pfannenstiel quickly left the court after the judge's decision without commenting.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Galvan, said the judge's decision adhered to the letter of the law, which states that an injury must exist for abuse to occur.</p>
        <p>''If you want the child abuse statutes to cover fetuses, then you go to the Legislature and you ask them to enact that statute,'' Ms. Galvan said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gary Lang, a pediatrician, testified that studies have shown that pregnant women who drink excessively are prone to give birth to children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome, in which the children exhibit physical and mental developmental defects. But Dr. Lang could not say definitely that the defendant's fetus had been injured by its mother's drinking.</p>
        <p>Judge Denhardt declined at the beginning of a preliminary hearing to dismiss the case. He made his ruling after hearing testimony.</p>
        <p>The defense never presented witnesses, winning the dismissal after the state closed its case.</p>
