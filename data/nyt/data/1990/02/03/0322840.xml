        <p>LEAD: Peter Cohen, 43, was ''a model of the 1980's breed of bold young leaders of Wall Street,'' according to The New York Times.

        <p>Peter Cohen, 43, was ''a model of the 1980's breed of bold young leaders of Wall Street,'' according to The New York Times. Tuesday he resigned as boss of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. under pressure from its parent conglomerate, the American Express Company. The Wall Street Journal said his friends had noticed signs of trouble: ''Mr. Cohen was putting on weight and looked as though he was missing sleep.''</p>
        <p>''Bold and young'' was what Wall Street called Kirk Nimbus in the 1980's. Now, though, it was the 1990's, and the Street was watching him with gimlet eye. They were whispering in bars where Wall Streeters gathered after a hard day's trading, merging and acquisitioning.</p>
        <p>''Nimbus is not as lean as he used to be,'' they whispered.</p>
        <p>''And he's not as young either. They say 10 years have passed, 10 summers with the length of 10 long winters, since first he gazed upon Reagan's big bull market. In short, he is now a middle-aged 40.''</p>
        <p>In the Street they knew what 40 meant for people once called ''bold and young.'' Kirk Nimbus knew, too.</p>
        <p>''From now on, they will have to call me 'bold and middle-aged,' '' he told Clutterbuck, his craven yes man. He spoke these words on his 40th birthday, and since celebration was in order, he called for his pipe, he called for his bowl and he called for his finaglers three.</p>
        <p>Nimbus had given up tobacco in order to live forever and hear Wall Street some day call him ''bold and eternal.'' For this reason the celebratory pipe-smoking had to be done by Clutterbuck, who hated smoking but didn't dare refuse, lest he invite a hostile merger.</p>
        <p>Clutterbuck had suffered the experience once - he was the result of Nimbus's brilliant merger of Leo Clutter and Buck Sump - and blanched at the thought of having to pay investment bankers all the new millions they would charge for shuffling merger papers, selling his inefficient pieces and unloading surplus personnel. The first go-around had cost a pretty penny, plus a pretty pile of million-dollar bills, when Mrs. Clutter and Mrs. Sump had to be sloughed off.</p>
        <p>While puffing Nimbus's celebratory pipe, he was amazed to see the boss lift his bowl, ingest its content and call for another. Nimbus's finaglers three were furious. Afterward they met at the Finagler's Club over lime slices floating in imported spring water.</p>
        <p>No one had ever seen Nimbus take one bowl, much less two. What had attracted the finaglers to Nimbus was his emaciation. They had followed the New York rule for success: ''Run with the crowd with the rattling bones.''</p>
        <p>Six feet four inches tall and weighing 93 pounds, Nimbus was not only the most clattering figure on Wall Street, he was also the envy of starving hostesses from Westport to Palm Beach, for it had been 15 years since he took a bowl.</p>
        <p>On his 40th birthday when he took two, his finaglers three saw the handwriting on the wall, or as they say in the fancier Manhattan circles, ''the flesh on the skeleton.''</p>
        <p>Their days of wallowing in simoleons generated by the fury of Nimbus's sublimated hunger were clearly numbered, though being finaglers instead of psychobabblers, they didn't know it was sublimated hunger that made Nimbus a genius.</p>
        <p>Next day they put out job feelers, and three minutes later all Wall Street had heard the news: Bold, young Kirk Nimbus had not only become bold, middle-aged Kirk Nimbus; he had also called for two bowls. Not just one bowl; two bowls. The Dow Jones immediately fell 500 points.</p>
        <p>Nimbus was so enchanted by experiencing the bowls that he disguised himself that night, went to a restaurant and called for a bowl, called for a plate, called for a salad dish, called for dessert, and called for a Chateau d'Yquem.</p>
        <p>On the way home he stopped at a convenience store and called for a quart of chocolate ice cream, then had second thoughts and called for a container of whipped cream and a jar of maraschino cherries with which to decorate it.</p>
        <p>Within the week, Nimbus was doomed in the Street. The dread words ''putting on weight'' swelled from whispered rumors to poisonous news items in Washington newsletters.</p>
        <p>Enraged, he called for his finaglers three, accused them of trying to destroy him by leaking the bowl story, and announced he was going to merge them into Finaglers One.</p>
        <p>They laughed and said, ''You couldn't organize a three-finagler merger, Fatso.''</p>
        <p>An hour later he resigned under pressure from Clutterbuck, who'd promised the board he would never call for a bowl.</p>
