        <p>LEAD: Are the 2.5 million schoolchildren in New York State the victims of a ''Eurocentric'' curriculum that strips minority students of their dignity? Should teachers seek to systematically reduce the ''arrogance'' of white students?</p>
        <p>Are the 2.5 million schoolchildren in New York State the victims of a ''Eurocentric'' curriculum that strips minority students of their dignity? Should teachers seek to systematically reduce the ''arrogance'' of white students?</p>
        <p>These are some of the questions the New York State Board of Regents, the nation's oldest and most powerful education policy-making board, will be pondering next week when it considers the report of the 17-member Task Force on Minorities.</p>
        <p>The task force was appointed by State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol in November 1987 to determine, among other things, whether the state's curriculum guides ''adequately reflect the pluralistic nature of our society.''</p>
        <p>Its answer: that the state's curriculum is seriously flawed and must be rewritten so that minority students ''will have higher self-esteem and self-respect, while children from European cultures will have a less arrogant perspective.'' To enforce the changes, the task force urged the apppointment of a special assistant for cultural equity.</p>
        <p>The report, titled ''A Curriculum of Inclusion'' and released last July, drew widespread criticism. Bill Honig, California's superintendent of public instruction, called it ''nothing but racism.'' Several black educators, including James Comer, a Yale University psychiatrist, said that changing the curriculum was a simplistic approach to improving self-esteem among minority youth.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Sobol responded. He rejected the recommendation for a new cultural equity czar and conceded that the rhetoric in the report was offensive to some. But he also said that the task force had made a valid point, and that he would ask the Regents to assemble a racially balanced group of scholars and educators to examine the curriculum imbalances - something the task force, all but one of whose members were nonwhite, supposedly did in the first place.</p>
        <p>The issue raised here is reminiscent of the politicizing of curriculum during the social upheavals of the 1960's. It resurfaced several years ago when Stanford University removed a Western Civilization course from its core curriculum.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the issue is how to deal with both dimensions of the nation's motto: ''E pluribus unum'' - ''Out of many, one.'' The current search is for a healthy balance.</p>
        <p>The pluribus part is the easiest. California, for example, recently enacted a social studies framework with 17 guiding principles, including an obligation to incorporate ''a multicultural perspective throughout the history-social science curriculum.'' The District of Columbia has begun an ''Afrocentric Education Initiative''; Atlanta has a similar project.</p>
        <p>In 1987, New York State revised its ninth- and tenth-grade social studies curriculum to stress other cultures. Students now take a two-year world history sequence divided equally among Western Europe, Latin America and other areas.</p>
        <p>The unum part - teaching about what Americans have in common -is trickier. Many fundamental political institutions trace their development through ancient Western civilizations and European thinkers. But the task force argued that even when dealing with topics like the writing of the Constitution, curriculum developers must find a contribution from every major ethnic group.</p>
        <p>Other educators, though, note that even institutions rooted in one ethnic tradition undergo change. The ideas of America's founders, for example, were extended by figures like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a black man named after a prominent European and profoundly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
        <p>''When you talk about civil rights, you don't talk about Thomas Jefferson,'' said Francie Alexander, associate superintendent of education in California. ''And remember the Chinese in Tiananmen Square? They quoted both Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King Jr.''</p>
        <p>Balancing pluribus and unum requires the recognition that justice starts with truth. Critics of the task force include black educators like Wade Nobles, director of the Center for Applied Cultural Studies and Educational Achievement at San Francisco State University, who argued that tearing down one group in the interest of another's self-esteem is counterproductive.</p>
        <p>''They've raised a silly issue,'' he said. ''The real issue is that the human community has created all sorts of wonderful things. No one group has a monopoly.''</p>
        <p>Nor may curriculum changes be the key to self-esteem. ''A sense of pride comes from several sources,'' said Dr. Comer, who has worked with dozens of inner-city schools. ''You get parents involved in the school so that students see mutual respect between members of their own group and the mainstream. You arrange exposure to living role models and make sure that students understand why their groups have not been well represented. Rewriting the curriculum in isolation from their own experiences is well down the list.''  EDUCATION</p>
