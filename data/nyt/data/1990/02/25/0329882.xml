        <p>While I read with interest the article on ''Things of Value: Worker or Tools?'' I found myself at odds with the writer's theme. My experience as both a lumber-truck driver and a public-works crew driver, while different than the machinist, had certain parallels.</p>
        <p>In the early 50's the drivers I knew, almost to a man, kept their trucks clean and regularly wiped off the cab, not because they had to but rather because they seemed to respect the trucks.</p>
        <p>I was attached to an army trucking outfit in Korea in the mid-50's just after the war. Some of the guys started sending home for Simonize to polish their trucks (which of course was not required). It was not long before this caught on, with other guys writing home for polishing wax.</p>
        <p>In the early 60's driving a crew service truck, the men rolled up hoses, cleaned tools, put them back in place and still cleaned their trucks.</p>
        <p>Sometime in the late 60's or in the 70's these practices began to change and a new general attitude began to come into place: It's expendable. In the 80's it was the exception when a driver took an interest in a truck, shovels rarely lasted a month and lots of times went to the dump as part of the load.</p>
        <p>While I still believe people should come before tools, my experience has been to see a respect for trucks and hand tools erode into a just-about total lack of respect for these things.</p>
