        <p>LEAD: Wisps of choreographic ideas drifted through ''Dances in and Out of the Agora,'' the program Silvia Marinari, Christine Coppola and Almalyn Largey offered on Monday night at the Ethnic Folk Arts Center.

        <p>Wisps of choreographic ideas drifted through ''Dances in and Out of the Agora,'' the program Silvia Marinari, Christine Coppola and Almalyn Largey offered on Monday night at the Ethnic Folk Arts Center. Some of their kinetic apparitions were mistily attractive. Others were totally insubstantial.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coppola and Ms. Largey explored a dangerous realm in their collaboratively choreographed work ''The Undoing (a Journey).'' Their determined crawlings and lungings conveyed the urgency of their undertaking. But there were also moments when their expedition seemed endless and the purpose of their mission remained a secret. Nevertheless, the dancers' intensity made one pay attention. And fine dramatic support was provided by a taut jazz score created and played by Solar, a trio of Adam Bernstein, bassist; Andrew Demos, drummer, and Eli Yamin, on electronic keyboard.</p>
        <p>The smaller the casts were in Ms. Marinari's dances, the more effective her choreography became. Ms. Marinari was particularly compelling in ''Dedicated to E.,'' a solo to a recording of the second movement of Mozart's Sonata in C for Piano and Violin (K. 296). Her gestures looked deliberately tentative, and they always appeared to emerge from and return to a stillness deep within her soul. As a result, when she reached out, she suggested that she was trying to touch someone now totally lost in time or distance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marinari was a specter who materialized before Wilfred Flores in the somewhat more diffuse ''Madeleine,'' to the second movement of Schubert's String Quartet (Op. 163, D. 956). In ''If on a Winter Night a Memory . . .,'' to excerpts from Brahms's Sonata in F for Piano and Violoncello (Op. 99), Ani Udovicki portrayed a writer seated at a table while Stephanie Jump, Tina Kambour and Ms. Marinari swirled around her as if they were characters she had created. Unfortunately, Ms. Marinari choreographically never let the plot thicken enough to arouse interest either in the writer or her fictions.</p>
