        <p>LEAD: After holding their religious observances in the student union through the 1980's, Muslims at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill can look forward to a distinctive, permanent place of worship in the 90's. The university's Student Muslim Association announced plans, approved by the city's planning board recently, to build a mosque and Islamic center for the 50 Muslim students in this college town of 40,000.</p>
        <p>After holding their religious observances in the student union through the 1980's, Muslims at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill can look forward to a distinctive, permanent place of worship in the 90's. The university's Student Muslim Association announced plans, approved by the city's planning board recently, to build a mosque and Islamic center for the 50 Muslim students in this college town of 40,000.</p>
        <p>The mosque will include a minaret and a sanctuary. The center will include a library and meeting room.</p>
        <p>But at a Chapel Hill Planning Board meeting convened to examine a site plan, residents argued that the mosque would cause noise problems because of the daily voiced calls to worship that precede the Muslim services. Others argued that the project would add to traffic problems.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Syed Mustafa, an adviser to the association and a medical laboratory technician at the university, expressed disappointment with the negative reactions, saying that churches and synagogues in the area do not create noise problems and that neither will the mosque.</p>
        <p>Mohammed Dar, a sophomore chemistry major from Greensville, N.C., and an association member, said Muslim services are almost completely performed in silence.</p>
        <p>'Negative Feelings'</p>
        <p>''The negative responses stem from a lack of understanding,'' Mr. Dar said. ''In the media, when you hear Islam, you hear terrorism and bloodshed. The net result is that people have negative feelings towards Muslims in this country.''</p>
        <p>For the last seven years, the association has used the student union for its meetings, lectures and Islamic cultural events, Mr. Dar said.</p>
        <p>''But we are in need of a place of prayer,'' Mr. Mustafa said.</p>
        <p>The association will rely solely on fund-raising to finance the project, hoping to receive donations from Muslims in the United States and overseas, as well as from alumni, Mr. Mustafa said.</p>
        <p>The project, divided into four phases, is expected to take 15 years to complete, beginning with the mosque. Construction will start this summer on a plot of land that the association bought in one of Chapel Hill's residential neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>At the Planning Board meeting, Kay Maltbie, the only one of the nine board members to vote against the plan, said that while a mosque is appropriate for the Middle East, its architecture is not appropriate for the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>But Runyon Woods, a local architect who is designing the project, says the mosque will complement the town.</p>
        <p>Many students were angered by the town's response to the project.</p>
        <p>''It's the same selfish idea - build a mosque, but don't do it in my neighborhood,'' said Debra Martin, a junior biology major from Oak Ridge, Tenn.</p>
        <p>Students who were previously unaware of the plans have demonstrated support and interest. Stephanie Segal, a first-year major in international studies from Chicago, said the center would make the university more open-minded.</p>
        <p>And Ellen Winstead, a first-year biology major from Lewisburg, Pa., said, ''It sounds like an exciting opportunity to understand a different religion.''</p>
