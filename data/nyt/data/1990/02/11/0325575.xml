        <p>LEAD: For the revolutionary executive, there is a Sandinista briefcase. For his wife, a Sandinista apron. And for the revolutionary child, there is everything from Sandinista lunchboxes to Sandinista building blocks.</p>
        <p>For the revolutionary executive, there is a Sandinista briefcase. For his wife, a Sandinista apron. And for the revolutionary child, there is everything from Sandinista lunchboxes to Sandinista building blocks.</p>
        <p>With national elections two weeks away, the governing Sandinista National Liberation Front has found a slogan-bearing gift or campaign favor for just about everyone. And whether you are in the market for a Sandinista beach ball, belt buckle or baseball bat, the message is bound to find you.</p>
        <p>''This is what happens when you pull out all the stops,'' a diplomat said.</p>
        <p>When the Government agreed last year to hold closely watched national elections on Feb. 25, most Nicaraguans expected the former guerrilla leaders to put their skills to work in a formidable display of organization and political strategy. But few were prepared for the scale of a campaign that now lights the country's cigarettes with Sandinista lighters and has made Sandinista shirts a universally acceptable form of dress, even at opposition rallies.</p>
        <p>Pervasive Government Hold</p>
        <p>The political cornucopia has been used to publicize the two major themes of the Sandinista appeal, peace and economic improvement, both of which are combined in the campaign's principal slogan: ''We won. Everything will be better.'' But underlying that message is a potent reminder of just where the power lies in a country where the Government holds the keys to everything from college scholarships to bank loans.</p>
        <p>In its most important form, the gift-giving has extended to the granting of property titles to urban squatters who live on state-owned land, in highly publicized ceremonies that opposition leaders have described as one of the most powerful political weapons confronting them.</p>
        <p>At neighborhood rallies throughout the country since last summer, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and other high officials have personally presided over the awarding of thousands of confiscated properties to local peasants. And when taxi drivers throughout the country went on strike over higher gasoline prices in June, threatening the Sandinista party with serious damage at the start of the election process, the Government quelled the revolt by providing the strikers with hundreds of new Soviet-made Lada taxis at subsidized prices.</p>
        <p>In a poor country where more than half the population is under the age of 17, the Government has focused on young people as well as adults, providing partisan gifts to hundreds of thousands of children. In the gift-giving festival of Purisima, which celebrates the Immaculate Conception in the first week of December, uniformed Sandinista leaders and troops gave away hundreds of thousands of toys, marked with the red-and-black colors of the Sandinista front.</p>
        <p>Million Toys for Christmas</p>
        <p>That record, which far exceeded previous years, was beaten only weeks later, when Mr. Ortega announced that his Government had set a goal of giving more than one million additional toys to Nicaraguan children at Christmas.</p>
        <p>The collective weight of such an all-out campaign has virtually overwhelmed the main anti-Sandinista coalition, the National Opposition Union, which has, by necessity or design, made a virtue of its far lower profile. ''We do not have or intend to have the kind of propaganda and organization that the F.S.L.N. has,'' said Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, the coalition's campaign manager. ''People are not going to judge and vote according to who has more propaganda and more money to spend.''</p>
        <p>Despite the omnipresence of Sandinista gifts and regalia, opposition leaders say, anti-Sandinista rallies appear to have gained momentum in the last several weeks. And some diplomats and foreign experts say the election outcome is too close to predict.</p>
        <p>Against the backdrop of Nicaragua's deep economic crisis, opposition leaders argue that the lavish Sandinista campaign may ultimately draw more public indignation than support. And despite promises from Sandinista leaders to repay any Government goods or services used in the campaign, the scale of the spending has sharply underscored complaints that their election effort is a Government enterprise, rather than a party one.</p>
        <p>'It's All the Same Money'</p>
        <p>''Even if the F.S.L.N. writes a check to the Government, it's all the same money, so what does it mean?'' a European Ambassador said.</p>
        <p>But other diplomats argue that the blurred line between Government and party is comparable in some ways to the problems of Western democracies where officials make use of their positions to win campaign advantage.</p>
        <p>Sandinista leaders acknowledge that they have spent more than the Opposition Union. But they say that they have no available figures on the total, and that the most visible give-aways have come in the form of donations from pro-Sandinista groups abroad.</p>
        <p>Bayardo Arce Castano, a member of the nine-man Sandinista National Directorate who is in charge of the campaign, compared this election with a previous national vote in 1984, when major opposition candidates withdrew from the race. Mr. Arce said that both stiffer competition and the stakes of the election had put a high premium on effective campaigning.</p>
