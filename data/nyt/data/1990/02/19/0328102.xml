        <p>LEAD: A Christian Scientist couple who tried to heal their ailing 15-month-old son through prayer instead of medical care, have been acquitted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment.</p>
        <p>A Christian Scientist couple who tried to heal their ailing 15-month-old son through prayer instead of medical care, have been acquitted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment.</p>
        <p>A Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, Robert Thomas, ruled on Friday that there was insufficient evidence to convict Elliot Glaser and his wife, Lisa, on the charges filed in the death of their son, Seth.</p>
        <p>The child died on March 28, 1984, of acute bacterial meningitis after a two-day illness.</p>
        <p>Under state law, parents are required to provide basic necessities for their children, including food, clothing and medical care. But a 1976 law sponsored by the Christian Science Church exempts parents who treat children through prayer alone.</p>
        <p>The Glasers had sought legal protection under that provision, arguing that they had taken their child to a Christian Science healer, Virginia Scott.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Seth developed a high fever and became delirious March 27. The next day, the couple took the boy to Mrs. Scott's home and prayed over him for about an hour and a half until he died.</p>
        <p>The issue was appealed to the California Supreme Court, which ruled that the exemption applies only to the felony charge of failure to provide basic necessities, and that it did not offer immunity from prosecution on other charges.</p>
        <p>After the appeal, both sides agreed to let Judge Thomas decide the Glasers' fate based on the transcripts of their 1985 preliminary hearing.</p>
        <p>The court's decision turned on evidence that the child showed brief bursts of recovery during predominant periods of high fever, vomiting and discoloration, Mr. Wells said.</p>
        <p>The judge ruled that the periodic points of promise raised in his mind a reasonable doubt as to whether the religious healing was a wanton and grossly negligent act, Mr. Wells said.</p>
