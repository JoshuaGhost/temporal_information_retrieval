        <p>LEAD: Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra appeared today in an emergency session of Parliament to defend himself against charges that he was implicated in his brother's personal financial activities.</p>
        <p>Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra appeared today in an emergency session of Parliament to defend himself against charges that he was implicated in his brother's personal financial activities.</p>
        <p>Today's session was the latest stage in a growing scandal that has dominated the press and comes just three months after the Socialists won their third successive electoral victory.</p>
        <p>The debate centers on the reported use of a Government office in Seville by Mr. Guerra's brother Juan for private business pursuits, and on whether Mr. Guerra knew of these activities. During the time Juan Guerra is said to have used the office, from 1983 to 1989, he was known as secretary or assistant to the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>In his appearance before Parliament today, Mr. Guerra denied any knowledge of the business deals of his brother and called for ''the law to be applied as it would be to any citizen.''</p>
        <p>The Andalusian judicial authorities are investigating the allegations.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders have called on Mr. Guerra to resign, but Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez told reporters after the three-and-a-half-hour debate that he would stand by his deputy.</p>
        <p>''I want to assure you,'' he said, ''that if at any time the Deputy Prime Minister succumbs to the temptation to resign, they will also have achieved the resignation of the Prime Minister.''</p>
