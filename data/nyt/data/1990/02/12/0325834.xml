        <p>Tonight George and Susan go about producing a new Newcomer. It will not give too much away to report that the process involves a transfer of the ''pod'' from her to him, that both experience contractions and that their teen-aged son, Buck, does too. ''If you women went through anything like us men go through,'' Buck whines, ''there probably wouldn't be any babies at all.''</p>
        <p>Fans of ''Alien Nation,'' the diverting and edifying Fox Broadcasting series that began in September to generally pleased reviews and pleasing ratings, will recognize the show's spirit in this synopsis. Others can catch it for themselves at 9 o'clock tonight on Channel 5.</p>
        <p>Tonight's episode, ''Partners,'' plays around with conventions of gender in a typically role-switching way that culminates next week in the oddest sort of birth that ever reached television. The series has discovered its special subject. Kenneth Johnson, the show's creator, has adroitly reworked his not particularly successful 1988 movie, ''Alien Nation,'' about the assimilation of creatures from outer space in Los Angeles. Keeping standard ingredients of the buddy-cop flick and sci-fi tale, he adds neat twists that make for a surprisingly fresh and engaging hour a week.</p>
        <p>It all happens circa 1995, a few years after a spaceship with 270,000 slaves came down in the Mojave Desert. The Newcomers can be recognized by heads that look like paisley honeydews, by their minuscule ears and by their language, a sort of stunted Swedish that requires subtitles. By the time the viewer meets them, these superstrong folks are making it in the United States.</p>
        <p>Yes, the ''slags'' encounter prejudice. To the earthlings, black as well as white, they all look alike, yet are disturbingly different. Get it? Naturally, the Aliens respond by insulting the humans, whom they call ''terts.'' Since George Francisco, the first Newcomer detective, is teamed with Matt Sikes, a tough cop with a soft heart, there is plenty of opportunity for them to battle various forms of bigotry together and, more interestingly, to play off against each other's preconceptions.</p>
        <p>So far the good guys have managed to take shots at racial purists, religious zealots and homophobes. The lessons are hard to miss. Referring a few weeks ago to a murderous religious leader, Matt said: ''You find guys like this in every religion. They burn books, hell, they even burn people - all in the name of what they call God.''</p>
        <p>Not much new about that. But whatever the failings of sitcoms, they are unfailingly on the right side when it comes to bigotry. By and large, prime-time entertainment has been in advance of much of the populace in its treatment of racial and religious minorities. Although some of the Newcomers in ''Alien Nation'' turn out to be bad guys (and that's part of the lesson, too) in most ways the minority is superior to the majority, in accordance with television tradition. But ''Alien Nation'' delivers its messages, which owe quite a bit to feminist doctrine, in quirky ways -particularly when it comes to biology. In an entertaining November offering called ''Three to Tango,'' human viewers learned that a third party, a ''binnaum,'' is required to conceive a Newcomer baby. The work of this mild fellow, who services 600 to 700 couples a year (''I eat a lot of raw pancreas'') comes to fruition in tonight's and next week's episodes.</p>
        <p>Tonight's plot, about a good cop gone bad, is routine, but the real theme is the sexual scramble. George, in a delicate condition, gets the sulks over Matt's affection for a black detective. ''Are you jealous?'' asks Matt. ''No,'' says George, ''I'm emotional.'' Newcomers, by the way, all hope for female children.</p>
        <p>Popular notions of manliness are kicked around on next week's ''Real Men,'' a much better show, in which George comes down with birth pangs while investigating the use of drugs by weight lifters. (They shoot up with Newcomer male hormone, which is even more powerful than steroids and a lot more dangerous since, among other things, it can cause impotence; and everybody knows how the macho crowd feels about that.) George, who is visibly pregnant, scoffs at the muscle men. Why, he asks, should such a ''distortion of the body'' be considered manly?</p>
        <p>If that were not enough, Matt is being visited by an old pal who sees women as sexual objects. Speaking of Cathy, the cute Newcomer next door, Nick says: ''If she was my neighbor, I'd be all over her. I mean, all over her.'' That leads Matt, who has a yen for Cathy in a respectful way, to question such expressions of manliness. Matt (Gary Graham) serves as the viewer's surrogate, as he comes to understand and accept the seemingly odd doings and assumptions of the Newcomers and to wonder about his own assumptions and those of other guys. As a droll aside, Nick the womanizer is portrayed not as a hulk but as slightly effeminate.</p>
        <p>The gender-mixing gag, though pushed hard, works more often than not. When Matt tells George to stop complaining about his painful back and swollen ankles, George bursts out: ''I shouldn't expect you to sympathize. You don't have to get up five times a night to urinate. You have no understanding of what I'm going through.'' Furthermore he's worried about stretch marks.</p>
        <p>Even sensible George finds himself slightly infected by the virus of machisma, until the end when he recognizes that he has been trying to conform to the human ideal of masculinity. ''In denying my femininity, my incubation, I've denied myself.'' The message may bring a smile, but the gentle yet manly characterization of George (Eric Pierpoint) makes it touching.</p>
        <p>The point of view, as on most of television, is unexceptionably tolerant (the bad guys include skinheads and Kluxers), but the delivery is without heavy breathing. And the best shows like ''Real Men,'' smartly written by Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider, are put-ons of the critics of conventional attitudes as well as of the attitudes themselves.</p>
        <p>''Alien Nation,'' lighthearted in spirit and by Fox standards light on sex and violence, manages to be earnest without being insipid. It's one smart sitcom. Will George get to the birthing center in time? Not to worry. Next week's show ends not with a bang but with a happy whimper.</p>
