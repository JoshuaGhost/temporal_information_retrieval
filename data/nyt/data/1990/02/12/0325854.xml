        <p>Gunfire forced a British army helicopter down near the border with the Irish Republic today, the police said. An anonymous caller said the I.R.A. had shot it down.</p>
        <p>Three soldiers were taken to a hospital with injuries suffered in a forced landing near the village of Clogher in County Tyrone, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said. None was thought to be seriously hurt, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>A witness reported hearing machine-gun fire before the helicopter went down.</p>
        <p>It was not immediately known, however, whether any shots hit the aircraft, which had been on a reconnaissance flight, the spokesman said. He said the area was sealed off and an investigation was under way. The witness, speaking anonymously, said the helicopter had crashed.</p>
        <p>A caller claiming to speak for the Irish Republican Army telephoned the BBC and said the I.R.A. had shot the helicopter down.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. is fighting to drive the British out of the predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite it with the Roman Catholic republic.</p>
