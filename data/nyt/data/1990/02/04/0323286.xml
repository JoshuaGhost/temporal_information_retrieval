        <p>LEAD: POTENTIALLY one of the most prosperous agricultural spots in Africa, the Sudan is facing yet another famine, this time caused not by weather but by war.</p>
        <p>POTENTIALLY one of the most prosperous agricultural spots in Africa, the Sudan is facing yet another famine, this time caused not by weather but by war.</p>
        <p>Unlike in 1988, when Western relief officials insisted that they had been unaware of the hunger that caused 250,000 deaths in the country, international plans have been made to alleviate the suffering that is sure to come. But the junta in Khartoum and its southern rebel opponents are putting military and political tactics first as they push for battlefield victories before the annual rains that begin in May. Both sides are refusing to allow the humanitarian work that the southern Sudan depends on because fighting or fear of fighting prevent planting and harvesting.</p>
        <p>With travel so precarious in the southern region and the flight of so many displaced to the north and into Ethiopia, neither the United Nations nor the International Committee for the Red Cross has an accurate picture of the number of people left in the southern Sudan. Those likely to be affected by famine could range from one million to three million.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Ethiopia, also locked in a civil war, an even larger famine is in the making with more than four million people needing food aid because of widespread drought. Both the Ethiopian Government and the rebels are bargaining with Western powers for donations of food, knowing that the side with the most relief can also be the most powerful.</p>
        <p>Hopes are somewhat higher that starvation can be averted in Ethiopia. In the province of Eritrea, there has been a long lull in fighting and the relief effort appears well run.</p>
        <p>The Government of Mengistu Haile Mariam, wanting to impress Western donors, has offered to allow Ethiopian church groups to take food to Tigre, a province entirely controlled by rebels, where at least one quarter of the four million Ethiopians who are at risk live. The Tigrean rebels have yet to agree. But even if they do not, peasants moving to the border between Tigre and parts of Eritrea controlled by the Government could pick up food now arriving in large quantities at Massawa, an Ethiopian port.</p>
        <p>The difficulties in the Sudan seem more intractable. The leader of the military Government, Maj. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, has said that he favors continuing the United Nations relief operation that went into full swing last year. But the Government's actions suggest otherwise. Planes carrying food, medicine and relief workers to rebel-held territory were banned last November, two-way radios used by relief workers in isolated areas to keep in contact with their headquarters in Khartoum have been taken by the army, and aid officials are having difficulty getting travel permits. The snarling tone of a top Government official, Abu Geziza, who recently asserted that humanitarian aid helped the rebels, also cast severe doubts on the junta's sincerity.</p>
        <p>A Trickle of Aid</p>
        <p>Against this hostility, the United States, the chief financial backer of last year's United Nations relief effort, appears virtually impotent. Economic aid to the Sudan, once one of Washington's best-kept clients in Africa, will end this month under a Congressional law halting aid to a junta that toppled a democracy. A trickle of military assistance still flows, but not enough to hold any leverage over the Government.</p>
        <p>Washington is increasingly frustrated as aircraft paid for with American funds to transport food, medicine and relief workers stand idle. A plane that had permission from Sudanese officials to fly after the ban took effect was shot down, killing three workers of Doctors Without Borders, an organization that specializes in medical aid. Aid workers believe that Government soldiers fired on the plane to deter other flights.</p>
        <p>The rebels, whose group is known as the Sudan People's Liberation Army, have their own tactics for stalling relief work. Last month, the Khartoum Government said it might reconsider allowing supply planes into the southern Sudan if Sudanese officials could check all flights for weapons before they left for the rebel-held areas. The guerrillas said they wanted nothing to do with the plan. In the meantime, they have urged the residents of Juba, most of them displaced peasants, to move to the countryside, where there is no food, so the rebels can have a free hand to bomb the town.</p>
        <p>The looming famine and the collapse of the relief operation are perhaps nowhere more evident than in the hamlet of Abyei, in the region that divides northern and southern Sudan. Last year shipments of food were plentiful and the village had a hospital with medicine and doctors. But a few weeks ago, the last foreign aid worker, stranded without radio communication, drove out of the town after shooting broke out. The hospital is without supplies, and what dwindling food is left in Abyei for its 40,000 people is under the control of the army commander from the north. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that up to 100,000 southern Sudanese will try to trek toward Abyei in coming weeks. Because there was relief food in Abyei last year, the southern Sudanese will expect it again and will be shocked to find there is not enough this time.</p>
        <p>The refusal of both sides to take part in serious peace talks to end the seven-year war, the growth of the Government-backed militia and the successful push by the rebels across the southwestern swath of the country suggest that war will persist as famine relief fades away. And once again, residents of the southern Sudan - despised by the junta, neglected by the rebels who are supposedly fighting for them and seemingly beyond the reach of the international community - are likely to face starvation.</p>
