        <p>To people in the U.S., Central America seems a region of unrelieved violence and insecurity, dominated by extremists and peopled by death squads, drug lords, shadowy agents and assorted pistoleros. To the visitor, Costa Rica thus comes as not just a pleasant surprise but a genuine shock. Wedged between Panama and Nicaragua, this little nation, no bigger than Vermont and New Hampshire, seems literally to revel in democracy.</p>
        <p>More than 80 percent of its registered voters turned out this week to elect Rafael Calderon Jr. as President, thereby rebuffing the party of the popular Oscar Arias Sanchez, who had won the Nobel Prize for his peace plan but who could not, by law, succeed himself. The differences between Mr. Calderon and his opponent, Carlos Manuel Castillo, were not great. The decisive factor, according to exit polls, was that Mr. Arias's National Liberation Party had won five of the last six elections. That makes the average Costa Rican nervous.</p>
        <p>The guidebooks unashamedly call Costa Rica ''the Switzerland of Central America.'' It has mountains, 100 years of democracy and no standing army. It also has blemishes. There's poverty, a budget deficit and much hand-wringing about complacency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calderon himself is an unknown quantity with an odd political pedigree. His godfather was the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Garcia, the founder of the Somoza dynasty. Mr. Calderon's father was driven into exile in 1948 after bringing on a civil war by trying to win a second term. But the father also established a social security system; and the son, a hard-liner in foreign affairs, claims to be a populist on social issues.</p>
        <p>Romanticizing Costa Rica is obviously risky. But warming to it is irresistible. A recent visitor found himself in the middle of a huge demonstration in downtown San Jose. He looked nervously about for weapons, and saw none. What he did see was a river of automobiles, including what seemed to be every taxi in town, and what he heard was a thousand car horns blasting away in code - three longish blasts for Calderon, three shortish ones for Castillo.</p>
        <p>Each car was festooned with party flags - green and white for Castillo, red and blue for Calderon. Astonishingly, some cars carried both flags.</p>
        <p>''One for the driver,'' explained Ruben Martin, a transplanted Cuban. ''And the other, probably, for his mother-in-law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin is no stranger to politics. In Cuba, he fought to overthrow Fulgencio Batista and soured quickly on Fidel Castro. Later he opened a restaurant in Berkeley, Calif., and now runs an elegant bed-and-breakfast, Finca Rosa Blanca, outside San Jose. After Cuba and Berkeley, he finds Costa Rica peacable.</p>
        <p>''Two families living in the same bungalow can split down the middle,'' he says. ''Their kids go off to school dragging red and blue flags and green and white flags. And when it's all over, they put the flags away for another four years.''</p>
        <p>What accounts for this relative harmony? Relative poverty, for one thing. Costa Rica's meager natural resources made it unattractive to the Spaniards and thus spared it the divisiveness bred by the Spanish colonial experience. Costa Rica's rugged topography doesn't lend itself to huge farms and huge fortunes, thus blunting the evils of oligarchy while encouraging resourcefulness and the growth of a middle class.</p>
        <p>Costa Rica also encourages children to ''vote.'' This year the Government guided 10,000 children, some only 4 years old, through the intricacies of registration and voting. Of course their votes didn't count. What counts is knowing that some day they will.</p>
