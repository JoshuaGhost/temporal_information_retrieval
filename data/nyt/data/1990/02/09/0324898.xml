        <p>The Carlyle Group L.P., a Washington investment firm, said that it had acquired 6.27 percent of the Harsco Corporation and that it believed the pipe-fitting and metals concern, based in Camp Hill, Pa., was ''a potentially attractive acquisition candidate.''</p>
        <p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, HC Partners L.P., a group in which Carlyle is the sole general partner, said it intended to seek meetings with Harsco's senior managers ''to explore ways in which Harsco and the partnership can work together to increase shareholder value.'' The group acquired its 1.64 million Harsco shares for an average of $25.81 each. Harsco's stock rose $1 today, to $26, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
