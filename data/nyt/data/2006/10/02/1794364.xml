        <p>So, who is the common denominator in the scandals and inquiries roiling state politics? Paul Shechtman. He may not be a household name, but he is all over the place.</p>
        <p>Consider Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi's decision to use a state worker to drive his wife around, and his tardiness in reimbursing the state. That is being investigated by the State Ethics Commission, whose chairman is -- Paul Shechtman, below.</p>
        <p>Then there is the federal investigation into whether Jeanine F. Pirro, a candidate for attorney general, tried to secretly tape her husband. Ms. Pirro's lawyer in that case is none other than -- Paul Shechtman.</p>
        <p>And the state's lobbying commission is taking a look at whether some of the work that Mr. Faso, the Republican candidate for governor, did as a lawyer should have been reported as lobbying. The chairman of that commission, of course, is -- Mr. Shechtman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shechtman, a former Pataki administration official, did not respond to calls and e-mail messages seeking comment about the various hats he manages to wear.</p>
