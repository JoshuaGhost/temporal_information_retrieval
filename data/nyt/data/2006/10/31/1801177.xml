        <p>ON Columbia Street in Red Hook, where Brooklyn disappears into Gowanus Bay, there is a hole at the bottom of a fence behind a baseball field. Every Sunday in the spring, summer and fall, it becomes the city's smallest takeout window.</p>
        <p>As holes in fences go in this rusting edge of a city that is full of them, this one seems mostly unremarkable. It is more divot than hole, an earthen bowl formed by footsteps and rain runoff under a chain-link fence. It has neither the authority of the metal plank covering the hole across the way, nor the girth of the fine gap farther down the block, which any kid on a bike could sail through.</p>

        <p>ON Columbia Street in Red Hook, where Brooklyn disappears into Gowanus Bay, there is a hole at the bottom of a fence behind a baseball field. Every Sunday in the spring, summer and fall, it becomes the city's smallest takeout window.</p>
        <p>As holes in fences go in this rusting edge of a city that is full of them, this one seems mostly unremarkable. It is more divot than hole, an earthen bowl formed by footsteps and rain runoff under a chain-link fence. It has neither the authority of the metal plank covering the hole across the way, nor the girth of the fine gap farther down the block, which any kid on a bike could sail through.</p>
        <p>But Sundays, when Lourdes Pe単a cooks at her concession stand behind Baseball Diamond No. 1 of Red Hook Park and passes steaming plates through the hole to her customers on the other side, it seems as if the whole culinary history of Atlixco, Mexico, might journey through it.</p>
        <p>There are the tacos, or dobladitos as Ms. Pe単a, 32, calls the folded fried tortillas filled with melted cheese and topped with shredded lettuce, pico de gallo and cream. There is mole poblano, a chicken dish drowning in the chocolaty chili sauce that to some is as soothing as chicken soup and tastes like home. It is a crowd favorite and usually sells out quickly.</p>
        <p>There are hand-shaped corn tamales and tinga, a tomato sauce of stewed chicken and chipotle poured over quesadillas. There are taquitos and burritas, fried pancakes stuffed with beans or pork, as well as chicken Milanese and hefty sandwiches and pinto beans and rice and varieties of fresh juice, including watermelon. There are spicy sausages for breakfast and warm cinnamon-laced milk with rice for dessert.</p>
        <p>Most of Ms. Pe単a's customers are players and fans of the Mexican Baseball League, which plays in the park and is expected to finish its season on Sunday. Some, braving the dangers of the batting cage, walk right up to her table to place their orders.</p>
        <p>But many fans, especially those with small children, prefer to sit behind the protective chain-link fence. Rather than walk all the way to the gate, they stand over the hole, slip some money through the fence. Then they squat down to grasp the plates of food that Ms. Pe単a learned to make by her mother's side in Mexico, and which her mother learned at her mother's side, and her grandmother at her great-grandmother's.</p>
        <p>But the food is usually enjoyed long before anyone ponders this.</p>
