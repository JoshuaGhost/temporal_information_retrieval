        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered a coy reference to the 2008 presidential election on Wednesday night in Chicago, in dinner remarks to the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, which gave the mayor its Abraham Lincoln Award for his efforts to combat illegal guns.</p>
        <p>The mayor reminded the crowd, in a ballroom at the InterContinental Hotel, that the last time he had been in Chicago was in August, when he tried to woo Democratic delegates to hold their 2008 convention in New York City.</p>
        <p>''I think Barack Obama would love the Big Apple,'' the mayor said to peals of laughter, before adding this cryptic remark: ''After all, there are a number of potential presidential candidates in New York City.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg did not reveal whether he was considering adding himself to that list , which could be said to include Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Gov. George E. Pataki and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. But the mayor did compare himself -- humorously -- to the 16th president.</p>
        <p>''Lincoln and I are both Republicans,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We both pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps. We're both known for great oratory. We're both tall. All I need is some whiskers and it'd be perfect.''</p>
        <p>The mayor also revealed that in his Upper East Side townhouse, he has a sculpture of Lincoln, which he sees every day before leaving for work. ''I need a role model,'' he explained.</p>
