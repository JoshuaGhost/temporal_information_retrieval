        <p>A frantic three-and-a-half-hour search for a Manhattan boy missing in his mother's stolen sport utility vehicle ended with the boy safe last night when he was found 20 miles away in Nassau County, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>A frantic three-and-a-half-hour search for a Manhattan boy missing in his mother's stolen sport utility vehicle ended with the boy safe last night when he was found 20 miles away in Nassau County, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Jay Polanco, 8, was discovered around 8 p.m. after a man noticed the S.U.V. with a flat tire on the side of the Northern State Parkway near the Brush Hollow Road exit. The man, Thomas Knabbe of Westbury, offered to drive Jay and the woman who is suspected of stealing his mother's S.U.V. to an address in Great Neck, N.Y., where the woman said they were headed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Knabbe became suspicious when the woman, who appeared to be intoxicated, could not find the address. He then drove to the Sixth Precinct station house in Manhasset intending to ask for directions and seek help for the boy, who did not speak English. A Spanish-speaking police officer there talked with Jay and confirmed that he was the missing Manhattan boy.</p>
        <p>When officers went to the man's car, however, the woman was gone. She was arrested about an hour later while trying to hire a cab not far from the police station. The police did not release the woman's name.</p>
        <p>Jay's ordeal began just before 5 p.m. on Sherman Avenue in Inwood in Upper Manhattan, near his family's apartment. His mother, Belkis Gonzales, 39, had driven to a salon, leaving her mother in the double-parked S.U.V. with Jay asleep in back seat, according to Jay's sister Yara Perez, 21.</p>
        <p>When Jay's grandmother went inside minutes later to ask her daughter how much longer she would be, the woman climbed into the S.U.V. and drove away, Ms. Perez said.</p>
        <p>Jay was reunited with his mother just after 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>''He jumped on her and was crying,'' Ms. Perez said.</p>
