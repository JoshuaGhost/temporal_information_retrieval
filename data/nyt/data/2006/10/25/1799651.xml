        <p>This 30-second advertisement featuring the actor Michael J. Fox on behalf of Claire McCaskill, the Senate Democratic nominee in Missouri, began running there last weekend. Similar versions featuring Mr. Fox are running for candidates in Maryland and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Dixon/Davis Media Group.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, says: ''As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research. In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures. Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us a chance for hope. They say all politics is local, but that's not always the case. What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans -- Americans like me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McCaskill says, ''I'm Claire McCaskill, and I approve this message.''</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Fox is sitting in a darkened living room. His head and upper torso shake almost violently from side to side as he speaks, though he holds his gaze directly into the camera.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Talent's campaign says he supports stem cell research that ''does not involve cloning or destroying a human embryo.'' While this adult stem cell research, which he supports, is believed to hold promise, scientists also generally argue that they must pursue both adult and embryonic stem cell research in the hunt for cures for various diseases, including Parkinson's. Mr. Talent opposes a proposed amendment in Missouri that would grant state constitutional protection to stem cell research. Ms. McCaskill supports the amendment.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- There is no question that the advertisement is a powerful attention-grabber. And there is hardly a more effective spokesman for stem cell research than Mr. Fox, whose shaking would seem to make him an all the more sympathetic advocate. The advertisement clearly links Ms. McCaskill to a majority of likely voters, who polls show support the measure.</p>
