        <p>IN every television season some new lesson about the American audience is imparted. This season's lesson was clear within the first weeks of the fall: you can ask people to commit only so many hours to intense, dark, intricately constructed serialized dramas, to sign huge chunks of their lives away to follow every minuscule plot development and character tic both on the air and on Internet sites crowded with similarly addicted fanatics.</p>
        <p>Ask for more and you will get what happened to every network this fall. ''The Nine'' got low numbers. ''Vanished'' was banished. ''Kidnapped'' went unransomed. ''Smith'' was swift-kicked. ''Runaway'' sounded like a command.</p>

        <p>IN every television season some new lesson about the American audience is imparted. This season's lesson was clear within the first weeks of the fall: you can ask people to commit only so many hours to intense, dark, intricately constructed serialized dramas, to sign huge chunks of their lives away to follow every minuscule plot development and character tic both on the air and on Internet sites crowded with similarly addicted fanatics.</p>
        <p>Ask for more and you will get what happened to every network this fall. ''The Nine'' got low numbers. ''Vanished'' was banished. ''Kidnapped'' went unransomed. ''Smith'' was swift-kicked. ''Runaway'' sounded like a command.</p>
        <p>''The message we received was that people have strains on their lives,'' said Kevin Reilly, the president of NBC Entertainment. ''People are saying, 'I've got my handful of shows like this, and I don't want more.' ''</p>
        <p>Or as Kevin Lubarsky, a recent Villanova University graduate who has relocated to Los Angeles, put it one recent afternoon: ''Sundays you've got football. Then you've got a couple of these serialized shows. You can't spend your life watching television.''</p>
        <p>Inspired by the tremendous popularity of ''Lost,'' a program that is as hard to follow as it is to produce, the networks this fall introduced no fewer than 10 similarly demanding serialized dramas (and even a couple of comedies). Mr. Reilly was genuinely excited about the prospects for ''Kidnapped,'' NBC's series about the abduction of a wealthy New York family's scion. The show had high production values and an exceptional cast, including Jeremy Sisto, Delroy Lindo, Dana Delany and Timothy Hutton.</p>
        <p>It had three chances on Wednesday nights before being exiled to the wastes of Saturday night, where it is expected to die a quiet, premature death. Writers will try to wrap up the story in 13 episodes instead of the 22 that were planned.</p>
        <p>''Smith'' won't even get that minimally dignified exit. The CBS series, about a ruthless gang of master thieves, also had an impressive cast, headed by Ray Liotta and Virginia Madsen. But it was expunged from existence after just three episodes. If you want to know what happened to those characters, you'll just have to use your imagination. They will forever be suspended in midstory.</p>
        <p>Similarly, will we ever know what ''The Nine,'' ABC's drama about characters held hostage in a bank robbery, was supposed to add up to? It has the built-in advantage of following directly after ''Lost,'' but in its first four outings, it has frittered away an enormous number of viewers. That's even more than ''Invasion,'' the serialized drama that last year tried to march into viewers' homes on the heels of ''Lost.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of devoting time and passion to a show only to see it cut off, like a movie snapping in half in midprojection, has made a lot of viewers feel commitment-phobic this season.</p>
        <p>Mary Beth Fay, a high school teacher from Round Hill, Va., has been a faithful fan of serialized shows like ''Lost'' and ''Prison Break'' from the beginning of their runs. And she was willing to try a few more entries this season.</p>
        <p>But she said the demands on her time and concerns about cancellation sent her fleeing from some of the shows, like ''Six Degrees,'' ABC's serial about intersecting events involving six New York strangers. ''I decided not to stick with that one because it wasn't being very successful in the ratings. It's not worth watching a show if you're not going to get the story completed on the air.''</p>
        <p>Other viewers learned that lesson the hard way -- by committing themselves to a show, only to be left at the altar a few episodes later. They tend to be bitter. Writing on the Web site misguidedthoughts.com, someone using the name Runaway Fan'' lamented the injustice of it all: ''They could have at least let us see the rest of the season instead of getting us hooked and then dropping it.''</p>
        <p>It may be the network itself that pays the greatest price. On the same site, a fan named Jasmine wrote, ''I'm not watching the CW at all anymore.''</p>
        <p>Dana Walden, president of the 20th Century Fox Television studio, said: ''What the audience seems to be saying is: 'Enough. We can't get involved with more of these.' ''</p>
        <p>Logically this result should have been expected. But logic often runs aground in the offices of television executives who endlessly try to anticipate the future by repeating the past. Or, as Preston Beckman, executive vice president for entertainment for the Fox network, put it, ''In this business we always overcompensate.''</p>
        <p>It all started six years ago with ''24,'' the first of the you've-got-to-see-it-every-week dramas built around a single, suspense-laden, seasonlong storyline. The show, which appeared on Fox, became a hit in the United States and abroad, and even validated the emerging business of sales of DVD's of entire seasons of series.</p>
        <p>ABC raised the stakes two years ago with ''Lost,'' which became a bigger sensation than ''24.'' And viewers of ''Lost'' don't even get a resolution at the end of the season. They commit themselves to the show knowing that it will tease and confuse them for the entire length of its run.</p>
        <p>Fox expanded the genre last year by adding ''Prison Break,'' a less spectacular but still solid hit that also told a continuing story.</p>
        <p>Viewers were watching three of these densely plotted novelized series, and they were watching them with the kind passion network executives and program creators craved.</p>
        <p>Soon Hollywood talent agencies, where writers first kick around concepts for shows, and studio and network development offices, where programs are pitched every year, were filled with what Ms. Walden called ''big, hooky ideas'' for more shows that would stir the same passions.</p>
        <p>''It did sort of filter into the ether,'' she said. ''We were all having conversations about event drama, and all an event drama is is a serialized drama.''</p>
        <p>Part of the appeal was the chance to take on a new kind of challenge. ''It's difficult to get creative people not to want to do this kind of show,'' Mr. Beckman said. ''After you do 15 cop dramas, you get resistance to do more of them.''</p>
        <p>HANK STEINBERG already had the best kind of creative credentials when he walked into network offices ready to pitch his idea for ''The Nine.'' He had created a hit series in the CBS procedural drama ''Without a Trace,'' one of the many successful hourlong shows that tell a complete story each week. He was looking to branch out creatively.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to do a serialized show after doing a closed-ended, episodic series,'' Mr. Steinberg said. He was aware of ''24'' and ''Lost,'' he said, and how addicted viewers were to them, though he himself was not hooked.</p>
        <p>But he and his co-creator, his sister K. J. Steinberg, wanted a more realistic series, without any supernatural plot twists. ''We wanted the event to have a mundane quality to it,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''A sense of randomness.''</p>
        <p>The plan was to tell the story of a hostage crisis and the trauma it caused, but to tell it in flashbacks as the characters' lives moved forward. How exactly this was going to translate into many years of episodes had not been completely worked out, Mr. Steinberg said. Maybe, he said, ''we would propel Season 2 by a new series of events; we might not even be mentioning the bank.''</p>
        <p>In essence, the idea for ''The Nine'' was a big premise to a single story, something you might see unfolding in two hours in a theater.</p>
        <p>''It was more like a movie about a bank robbery, and by the end of the season you would see how that worked out,'' Mr. Steinberg said.</p>
        <p>For some critics of this year's serial dramas, that was part of the problem. Many of the season's new serial dramas seemed much more like ideas for movies than for extended television series.</p>
        <p>A poster named GregB on the Metacritic Web site (metacritic.com) said he was reluctant to commit to ''The Nine'' after seeing the pilot. ''Watching the pilot made me feel like I was reading a book and missing chapter 2-10, and then had all the characters talk about all those chapters,'' he wrote. ''I feel like I'm being teased.''</p>
        <p>One senior network entertainment executive, who spoke anonymously because his own network had put on several of the shows in question, said: ''You have this problem with these shows. If you don't give people enough information about the main plot every week, they get antsy and want to quit. And if you give them too much information, you start to ruin the suspense. So you wind up with a lot of deliberate confusion. And confusion is death for shows like this.''</p>
        <p>Another problem is that with such intricate plots, these shows are much more difficult to join in progress. Three episodes in, the audience for ''Kidnapped'' was dropping. Even if the network could attract more viewers, how could they follow the action if they had already missed the first three hours?</p>
        <p>After the first season of ''24,'' the decision-makers at Fox were torn over whether the show's gimmick -- one story told over 24 hours in real time -- should be maintained. Some said its second season should have a new format, where each episode would cover a self-contained 24-hour period. That would have made the series far less risky, more repeatable and utterly ordinary.</p>
        <p>But it might have ended up that way save for one thing: DVD sales. The first season was in stores, and it was selling well. That gave Fox hope, and the original model was retained.</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Walden said, those elements are crucial parts of the formula for how to get a new serialized drama made. ''At the studio we first check with our international sales and home entertainment departments before we go ahead.''</p>
        <p>None of that really matters, of course, if the show doesn't last. If a show can't get by 3 or 6 or even 13 episodes, no DVD will get made, and the international broadcasters will be left as much in the lurch as the viewers.</p>
        <p>That would seem to argue for networks to be as patient as possible with serialized shows. But, as Mr. Reilly noted, network executives get assailed for ''having itchy trigger fingers'' while also facing almost instant declarations in the news media that a new show is a flop and needs to be yanked from the schedule.</p>
        <p>Patience is just one lesson the networks have been struggling to learn. Bob Wright, the chairman of NBC, said he learned another from his own wife: don't schedule a show about a child's kidnapping at 10 p.m., right before every mother in America goes to bed.</p>
        <p>That pitfall extends to the whole premise of a series with dark and scary overtones. Some sense of uplift is needed in most of the episodes, several executives said, or viewers will feel a chill and walk away.</p>
        <p>Another lesson is to find some way to increase the audience for a show if it demonstrates promise -- and find it as quickly as possible. That's why some shows -- like ''24'' and ''Prison Break'' -- have run ''marathons'' of multiple episodes in a single night to hook viewers who might be curious but reluctant to dive in midstream. In addition, replays available on network Web sites the next day are intended to ensure that early fans aren't left adrift just because they had to attend a wedding or birthday party.</p>
        <p>EVEN when serialized shows do become hits, they face challenges that conventional shows do not. They never repeat successfully, for one thing, making it crucial to attract big first-run audiences and strong DVD sales.</p>
        <p>And holding onto huge ratings year after year is difficult. That seems increasingly to be the case with the genre's biggest hit so far, ''Lost.'' Now in just its third season, the show has seen its ratings fall more than 25 percent. While those numbers are still exceptionally good, ratings tend to increase for almost every conventional hit drama in the third season. It appears that new viewers are unwilling to join ''Lost'' at this point because the story is so far along and so convoluted that it would take weeks of DVD viewing to catch up.Given all the risks, and all the failure early this season, serialized dramas might be expected to be at a saturation point, or worse -- at the point when a creator walks into a network office to pitch a serialized drama and quickly gets ushered out of the building.</p>
        <p>Some of that may already be happening. Ms. Walden described a new wave of ideas landing at the feet of drama developers this year. ''We're hearing an awful lot of 'Grey's Anatomy' in the corporate world, 'Grey's Anatomy' in a lawyer world.''</p>
        <p>Even so, the door to serialized drama has not been completely closed. No one in the television business has overlooked the outstanding new hit of the fall season: ''Heroes'' on NBC. The convoluted, dense story of a group of people suddenly imbued with supernatural powers is straight out of the ''Lost'' playbook. And it is grabbing viewers and getting them to sign on for the long ride.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of how saturated the landscape might be,'' Ms. Walden said, ''there's always room for another great show.''</p>
