        <p>FALLING UPWARDS</p>
        <p>Essays in Defense of the Imagination.</p>
        <p>By Lee Siegel.</p>
        <p>337 pp. Basic Books. $25.</p>
        <p>''The novel is collapsing into memoir,'' Lee Siegel tells us in his introduction to this collection of alternately pugnacious and sentimental essays. ''More and more novels and plays are based on real events, or on earlier novels and plays.'' Once upon a time in America, ''the creative world's ranks were ordered according to personal gifts and idiosyncrasy, audacity and the capacity for self-reinvention. Now, in New York, you go to a literary, artistic or intellectual party and you encounter the same pecking order that exists in the conventional world.'' We turn our lives into trashy art and become suspicious of all art that won't cater to our simplest, most easily gratified needs. And no one, it seems, is worrying about this. ''We hear nothing about how the individual work of art in our time, in the particulars of its form and content, has assimilated not just the values of commercial society, but the vast supple consciousness that a universal spirit of commercialism fosters: get your own, and get it fast, and do it behind a virtuous appearance and with an optimistic air.''</p>
        <p>Much of this argument is too shallow to be wrong. The novel is collapsing into memoir only if you pay no attention to what many good novelists are doing, and a person who thinks ''best-selling novels, like 'The Da Vinci Code,' read like actual histories'' needs to read a little more history. The attractive opposite of the contemporary pecking order is not another pecking order, but a realm where pecking is not the main issue. And if you are seeking audacity or a resistance to convention, perhaps a New York party is not the best place to start, even if you could float back into the early days of The Partisan Review. Still, Siegel has a point. There is a lot of expensive trash in the culture, and a lot of easy virtue. And good books and films do get ignored or sidelined.</p>
        <p>Siegel tells us that he had ''always been a reader'' as a child, but ''turned more purposefully to books'' when his father became unemployed. Hamlet, Raskolnikov, Cordelia, Ahab, Darcy, Hurstwood: ''The incidents in those characters' lives never stood humiliatingly alone, trapped behind the bars of monotone facts. ... Art imprismed me in its extenuating colors, and the multiplicity of truth -- of morals to be drawn -- set me free.'' This is a touching passage, although the imagery makes it hard not to hear ''imprismed'' as ''imprisoned,'' and there is a clue to the limits of Siegel's criticism here. He is never free of the feeling of not being free. He uses high art to attack his low contemporaries, and what he calls ''life'' to attack everyone else who writes about art. ''There is nothing literary about an effective novel,'' he absurdly writes, and Chekhov makes us want ''to talk not about literature ... but about life itself.''</p>
        <p>Let's not pause over the use of the word ''literary'' as a term of abuse -- there have been good philistine critics at least since Dr. Johnson. And in spite of the floppy vocabulary above, Siegel is quite acute about art he considers close to life, and writes better when he gets down to details.</p>
        <p>Here he is, for example, on a Russian painting, Kramskoi's ''Christ in the Wilderness'' (1872): ''Kramskoi's Jesus has the demeanor of a modern, urban man. Anomie enshrouds him. No supernatural phenomena appear around this Christ; his temptations come from within, and they take the form of familiar anguish and doubt. He is clasping his hands tightly between his knees, like a humble petitioner in a bureaucratic waiting room. ... He could be sitting crisis-ridden in a St. Petersburg park.''</p>
        <p>And here he is on Jane Austen's sentences: ''Like her self-deceived heroines, they are usually a little blind. They bear hints of their own impending amplification, qualification, contradiction. ... We feel propelled by a coming displacement of meaning.''</p>
        <p>In these essays drawn from the pages of The New Republic, Harper's and other publications, Siegel celebrates Harry Potter, John Updike, ''The Sopranos'' and Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' and excoriates queer theory and Barbara Kingsolver. In a wildly anachronistic and Americanized reading of Dante, he manages an interesting diagnosis of a form of egoism that hides from the self: ''The truth is ... few people want to read honest self-description. A full, unsparing account of one's self would be a full, unsparing and perhaps unbearable exposure of social and political and cultural reality. It would include not just our stories and afflictions and memories but our ability to injure and to deceive, to hurt and to kill.''</p>
        <p>Siegel knows how to praise and to blame, but he can't do both at the same time. ''Supple,'' for him, always means shifty, never means graceful. Of course, he would be right to note the slack in sentences like the following: ''Yellow ribbons swelled from suburban front doors. ... But this folklore, a prayer of godspeed to the killers, allowed no possibility that the vanquished might also be human.'' ''It's the difference between a more perfectly ordered world as shiny as a new pair of shoes and that precious, dirty, fraying old pair of sneakers (one of which lies hidden in shadows under the bed) that poets call the human heart.'' ''But we know, in our heart of hearts, that there are times when we must follow our instincts, obey our intuition, take advice from the deepest part of ourselves.''</p>
        <p>No decent critic would miss the mush and self-congratulation here -- but isn't there also, struggling among these rather helpless and maudlin verbal gestures, an attempt to say something that matters? Siegel might conceivably agree, since although the first sentence comes from Kingsolver, the other two are his own.</p>
        <p>We need to return to the story of the child who began to read so eagerly and found so many morals in literature. Is this tale true? Why would we ask? People get fired, children step up their reading. And if it isn't true -- if Siegel's father never lost his job and Siegel had read only Barbara Kingsolver before he went to college -- what would we think? What should we think? That mere anecdote doesn't matter either way, perhaps, but Siegel doesn't believe we are capable of leaving the life of gossip alone, and goes to extraordinary lengths to prove his point. In a later essay -- the one in which he skewers Kingsolver for writing ''so facilely about lost people'' among other sins -- the father is brutal as well as unemployed, the mother is sluttish and occasionally incestuous, a sister has brain damage, and a brother is an addict, who fortunately gets straightened out by his caring black wife. There is also an uncle who has been in jail, whose companion is H.I.V. positive. ''I have a pretty good life now,'' Siegel writes, ''but I cannot forget those nights'' -- the ones when every wounded family member was either crying or whimpering or screaming or sobbing or weeping or banging on the wall.</p>
        <p>Quite a chorus, and even the dimmest of us will suspect there is something wrong with this scenario. I thought, for instance, that Siegel had been reading too many memoirs too purposefully. But no. He was just lying. ''I made everything up,'' he explains. ''I meant it to be satire. Ihave passed beyond the boundary of good taste, and I apologize to anyone I have offended, since I know that the situations I described happen.'' He sacrificed his own stylistic dignity in order to teach us a lesson. But what lesson? That we shouldn't boast about our sufferings, even the real ones, and perhaps especially not the real ones? That suffering is in fashion, and that ''Calamity Writing,'' as Siegel calls it, is bad news? That suffering in writing becomes real only when the writing is really good? Siegel's own explicit moral is slightly different: ''The actuality and the complexity of suffering: that is precisely my point.'' A fine point, but surely the thick-edged satire manages only to mangle and bury the qualities it seeks to defend?</p>
