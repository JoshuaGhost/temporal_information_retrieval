        <p>There is an elusive beast in home electronics called the kitchen computer, a device meant to sit on the counter and serve up online recipes, Internet radio and e-mail to people too busy whipping up brownies to sit down at the PC. The Pepper Pad 3 just might fit that bill.</p>
        <p>The $699 Pepper Pad 3 isn't a tablet or a laptop, and it's far too underpowered to run heavy-duty software. But it has a Web browser and it supports most e-mail systems along with AIM instant messaging. It has better video playback and a faster processor than previous Pepper Pad models and is a bit cheaper. The Pepper Pad 3, the joint creation of Pepper Computer and HanBit Electronics, can be preordered at Amazon.com and eCost.com and will ship next month.</p>

        <p>The Pepper Pad has a built-in universal remote for turning on TV's and stereos, and there's a kitchen diary for storing recipes and notes. The entire device weighs 2.5 pounds. PC software allows you to stream music and photos from any computer on your wireless network.</p>
        <p>The Pepper Pad's split keyboard allows for quick thumb typing, although most of the main features appear as icons on the touch-sensitive screen, perfect for jabbing with a flour-covered finger.</p>
