        <p>Can anyone argue against more chocolate? Hershey, which has long fueled the country's craving, has introduced its Cacao Reserve line, whose labels state the percentages of cacao used. Milk chocolate (35 percent), plain or with hazelnuts, is richer than a regular bar. Dark chocolate (65 percent) comes plain or with crunchy chocolate nibs. The 3.5-ounce size costs $1.99 to $3.29, depending on the store; a 1.3-ounce size is 99 cents to $2.89. They are sold in supermarkets and at the Hershey's store in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Bouchon Bakery in the Time Warner Center is selling chocolate bonbons made by Sébastien Rouxel, pastry chef for all of Thomas Keller's restaurants, and Richard Capizzi, pastry chef at Bouchon. These finely wrought milk, dark and white chocolates, above, come with a dozen fillings, including peanut butter, bourbon ganache, fresh mint and lemon verbena. They are $2.25 each, and, in fancy boxes, $19 for 6, or $36 for 12.</p>

        <p>Coco-luxe chocolates, made in Sausalito, Calif., are decorated with retro designs of soda-fountain specialties and other foods that identify flavors like banana split, gingerbread, angel food and German chocolate cake. The afternoon assortment, $17.95, has nine pieces, three each of chai tea, green tea and mocha. The chocolates, far left, are available at some Whole Foods markets and at Coco-luxe.com.</p>
