        <p>Frank Thomas almost never wears the World Series ring he won last year with the Chicago White Sox. Mainly, he keeps it in a trophy case at his home in Nevada.</p>
        <p>It is not that Thomas feels undeserving, although foot problems limited him to 34 games last year, none of them in the postseason. ''I just don't like big rings,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Big swings, however, are another story. With two robust ones Tuesday, Thomas almost single-handedly negated the Minnesota Twins' Johan Santana/Metrodome advantage in this American League division series. His two solo home runs, off Santana and Jesse Crain, backed Barry Zito's strong pitching as Oakland won Game 1, 3-2.</p>
        <p>It was an unexpected blow for the Twins, who had won 23 consecutive starts at home by Santana since his last loss, to Oakland on Aug. 1, 2005. And with the Oakland veteran Esteban Loaiza opposing the Minnesota rookie Boof Bonser in Game 2 on Wednesday afternoon, the A's have a chance to take a commanding lead in this best-of-five series before it shifts to Oakland for Friday's Game 3.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's going to say we're done again, just like they've done all year,'' Twins first baseman Justin Morneau said.</p>
        <p>Before Tuesday, the Twins won eight consecutive postseason Game 1's. The loss was Minnesota's sixth in a row in the postseason at the Metrodome since 2002.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's game played out exactly as could be expected. Both teams managed little offense against Zito and Santana, each a former Cy Young award winner. Zito struggled with his control early and only struck out one batter, but he limited the Twins to four hits and one run (Rondell White's seventh-inning homer) in eight innings.</p>
        <p>Santana had gone 16-0 with a 1.93 earned run average in his 23-start home streak, and he might have won again Tuesday had Zito not been so effective. Santana also pitched eight innings and allowed his two runs in the second. The first, on a changeup Thomas lofted into the left-field seats just inside the foul pole, temporarily silenced the 55,542 hanky-waving Twins fans who packed the Metrodome hoping for another Santana victory.</p>
        <p>Thomas nearly hit another home run in the fourth, pulling a drive several feet left of the foul pole, and he singled in the seventh. Michael Cuddyer, the strong-armed Twins right fielder, came within a half-step of throwing him out at first.</p>
        <p>Thomas considered signing with the Twins in the off-season, but the club, concerned whether his healing foot would hold up on the Metrodome's FieldTurf, never made an offer. ''No hard feelings, no nothing,'' Thomas said.</p>
        <p>The Twins prefer to pitch around Thomas with men on base, but they never had the opportunity because he led off innings four times. Santana's most effective pitch is a changeup, and Thomas faced him enough over the years in the A.L. Central to know to wait for one when Santana fell behind him, 3-1, in the second.</p>
        <p>''I knew he was going to challenge me,'' Thomas said. ''He's challenged me the last four years or so. I got out front a little bit, but I kept my hands back and got it down the line.''</p>
        <p>The 38-year-old Thomas became the oldest player to have a multihomer game in postseason history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.</p>
        <p>Jay Payton's one-out single and a run-scoring double by Marco Scutaro later in the inning made things especially tough on the Twins, since Zito and closer Huston Street shut down the middle of their order.</p>
        <p>Joe Mauer, Cuddyer, Morneau and Torii Hunter combined to go 1 for 15. The only hit was a routine fly ball by Cuddyer that right fielder Milton Bradley lost in the roof for a triple in the ninth, which led to a run. Mauer, the American League batting champion, even tried to bunt for a hit in the sixth before walking.</p>
        <p>''Early in the game, we chased some high pitches when it looked like we could have made him work,'' Twins Manager Ron Gardenhire said of Zito. ''He made it tough on us. We hit a few balls hard, but not many.''</p>
        <p>The Twins also flubbed several chances to manufacture runs. A's catcher Jason Kendall threw out Luis Castillo trying to steal second base in the first. And in the eighth, Jason Bartlett led off with a double, but was stranded at third. The Twins finished 0 for 9 with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>Street had been shaky lately, blowing three saves in his last four appearances, so the extra run Thomas provided him in the ninth was significant. Crain tried to run a hard sinker down and in, but Thomas struck it crisply. ''The ball ran in, and I reacted,'' Thomas said. ''I'm just happy I saved that pitch.''</p>
        <p>Gardenhire said, ''I didn't see where the location of the pitch was, but obviously it was not a good pitch because he killed it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Oakland Manager KEN MACHA named DAN HAREN to pitch Game 3 and RICH HARDEN to pitch Game 4. Macha said he wanted to give Harden two bullpen sessions to work out a mechanical problem that led to six walks in his last start, on Sunday in Anaheim.</p>
