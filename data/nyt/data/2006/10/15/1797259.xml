        <p>MEETING the transportation needs of older adults, many of whom are expected to work and remain active longer than their parents did, promises to be a growing challenge for New York's suburban communities. Like most American suburbs, Long Island and Westchester grew up along with car culture. Yet nearly one-quarter of Westchester households with a resident age 65 or older does not have an automobile; in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the portion is around 15 percent.</p>
        <p>For suburban residents who do not own a car, as well as for those who either no longer want to drive or find themselves unable to as they age, public transportation is a key to quality of life. It is the only way many can shop for food, visit the doctor or simply remain engaged in the world around them by meeting with friends, going to the theater or simply out to a park.</p>

        <p>MEETING the transportation needs of older adults, many of whom are expected to work and remain active longer than their parents did, promises to be a growing challenge for New York's suburban communities. Like most American suburbs, Long Island and Westchester grew up along with car culture. Yet nearly one-quarter of Westchester households with a resident age 65 or older does not have an automobile; in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the portion is around 15 percent.</p>
        <p>For suburban residents who do not own a car, as well as for those who either no longer want to drive or find themselves unable to as they age, public transportation is a key to quality of life. It is the only way many can shop for food, visit the doctor or simply remain engaged in the world around them by meeting with friends, going to the theater or simply out to a park.</p>
        <p>Westchester and Nassau are better prepared for an aging population than many suburbs. Nassau (and Suffolk to a much lesser extent) is served by the Long Island Rail Road and by Long Island Bus, which has 333 vehicles operating on 54 fixed routes along with 85 paratransit vehicles for the disabled. Westchester is home to Metro-North's three commuter rail lines and the county's Bee-Line bus service, with 357 vehicles on 67 bus routes, and an additional 60 paratransit vehicles. People over the age of 60 use Bee-Line buses roughly 1.7 million times a year.</p>
        <p>In September, the Bee-Line started a new ''senior-friendly'' bus service in Yonkers. The redesigned Route 9 loop provides hourly service connecting centers for the elderly, supermarkets, drug stores, a hospital and medical offices, as well as the Yonkers train station, where residents can get to commuter rail and Amtrak service. The route was developed after intensive planning that involved organizing focus groups of the elderly to determine their needs and how best to meet them. The new Bee-Line service, while limited to southern Westchester, is a model for suburban transit.</p>
        <p>However, in both Long Island and Westchester, broader, long-term solutions are needed. Community and government leaders, transportation specialists, and developers need to get serious about encouraging mixed-use development -- siting businesses, transportation services and residences close together so people can more easily engage the world, with or without cars. This is especially important given that more Americans are expected to ''age in place'' in coming years, staying in their homes instead of moving to warmer climes as many did in the past.</p>
        <p>The full impact of our country's aging population has yet to be felt. But that is no justification for waiting. Given the extent of the challenges ahead, New York suburbs need to follow the Bee-Line's example and begin providing innovative transportation services to the elderly now.</p>
