        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Clark's article ''Survival Tips for the Aging Independent Filmmaker'' [Oct. 1] gives the impression that after a 40-plus-year career I feel cheated by the circumstances in which I find myself; however, I am scarcely surprised, as American history is replete with similar stories of creative outcasts and I consciously made my choice not to pursue the ''go Hollywood'' option or even ''go indie'' under the terms represented by others mentioned. My work -- some 25 feature-length films, 30 shorts, installations -- could be said to draw a portrait of exactly why I did not choose those paths. Our present cultural landscape suggests we live in a period of profound corruption, in which the only value honored is that of money -- its earning, spending, making. There are other values I chose instead, and I willingly pay the price for my choice.</p>
