        <p>NEXT week, the bull market will celebrate its fourth birthday. This means that this bull is on the verge of accomplishing what four of the past seven could not -- surviving to at least the start of Year 5.</p>
        <p>If history is any guide, that fifth year may be surprisingly robust. Since 1942, bull markets that made it that far still had enough gas in the tank to generate average fifth-year gains of 10 percent, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>

        <p>NEXT week, the bull market will celebrate its fourth birthday. This means that this bull is on the verge of accomplishing what four of the past seven could not -- surviving to at least the start of Year 5.</p>
        <p>If history is any guide, that fifth year may be surprisingly robust. Since 1942, bull markets that made it that far still had enough gas in the tank to generate average fifth-year gains of 10 percent, according to Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>If that's the case, why isn't Wall Street in a more celebratory mood?</p>
        <p>It may have to do with how long this bull market is taking to bring stock prices back to their previous highs. It's been more than six years since equity prices peaked, in early 2000. Although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index has rallied for four consecutive years, that benchmark is still 13 percent below its highest close in the previous bull market. As for the Nasdaq composite index, it is still down a stunning 55 percent from its record high.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the Dow Jones industrial average last week flirted with its all-time high close of 11,722.98, set in January 2000. But one reason that the Dow may have recovered faster is that it had a shorter path to travel. From peak to trough, the Dow fell 38 percent in the most recent bear market. Compare that with the 49 percent loss suffered by the S.&amp; P. and the 78 percent plunge in the Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>Historically, the S.&amp; P. has needed 3.3 years, on average, to return to new highs after suffering through a bear market, according to an analysis by InvesTech Research. But this time, don't be surprised if it takes significantly longer.</p>
        <p>For starters, the bear market that preceded this bull was no ordinary sell-off. ''It was the bursting of the largest bubble in U.S. capital markets history,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an asset management firm based in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Investors must realize that ''great bear markets have a lasting effect,'' said Jeremy Grantham, chairman of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo, the asset management firm in Boston. This hangover continues to influence the market today, he said.</p>
        <p>What's more, not all bull markets are created equal. Many, in fact, have simply not been strong enough to return stocks to their previous highs.</p>
        <p>Since September 1900, there have been 33 bull markets, according to Ned Davis Research. Of those 33, only 15 were able to establish new all-time highs. In other words, more than half of all bull markets fail to return stock prices to their prior peaks.</p>
        <p>Much of this depends on what kind of bull market you're dealing with. Mr. Arnott says that there are two types of bull and bear markets. First, there are cyclical bulls and bears, which run their course in the span of a few years. Then, there are longer-term, secular bull and bear markets; those can last for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnott noted that short-term cyclical bull markets could occur within longer-term secular bear markets. From 1966 to 1982, for instance, the broad stock market went virtually nowhere. But within that period, there were several cyclical bull and bear markets that sent stocks prices up and down.</p>
        <p>Many market strategists say that the current bull market is a cyclical rally stuck within a secular bear. One telltale sign is that the S.&amp; P. has yet to revisit its record high.</p>
        <p>Consider, too, the modest range of the recent four-year rally. ''While this has been one of the longest bull markets we've seen historically,'' Mr. Arnott said, ''it's also been among the weakest.''</p>
        <p>From the market trough in Oct. 9, 2002, the S.&amp; P. 500 has climbed 72 percent. By comparison, the average bull market has returned almost twice as much from trough to peak, based on data back to 1932, according to InvesTech.</p>
        <p>The solid but unspectacular returns are a classic symptom of a cyclical bull within a secular bear market, said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor in chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirsch recently studied past cyclical bulls trapped in secular bears. In those instances, the Dow rose by only around 35 percent, on average, going back to 1929. By comparison, cyclical rallies within secular bull markets have typically pushed stocks higher by 110 percent. For the record, the Dow is up by about 60 percent in the current bull market.</p>
        <p>The last cyclical bull market to occur within a secular bear started in October 1974, according to S.&amp; P. I It's hard to miss the similarities between today's market and that one.</p>
        <p>Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.&amp; P., noted that the bull that started in 1974 produced gains of 38 percent in the first 12 months, 21 percent in the next 12 months, a loss of 8 percent in the third year and 7 percent gains in the fourth and fifth.</p>
        <p>In the current bull run, the S.&amp; P. 500 gained 34 percent in the first year, 8 percent in the second and 7 percent in the third. And it is up by about 12 percent so far in the fourth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stovall added that the two periods have other things in common, like ''high oil prices, concerns over inflation, fallout from an expensive and unpopular war and a not-so-popular Republican president in his second term.''</p>
        <p>If this is a secular bear market, how long until it goes back into hibernation? That's hard to say.</p>
        <p>Given the enormity of the late-90's bubble and the duration of past secular bear markets, Mr. Arnott said, it could be that, taking inflation into account, ''15 years from now, stock prices won't be materially higher than they are today.''</p>
        <p>If he's right, investors will have to rely less on capital appreciation and more on personal savings to help them reach their investment goals. ''They're going to have to save more aggressively to get ahead,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Investors must also reset their overall expectations. Just because we're in a bull market right now, the stock market won't necessarily produce the 20-percent-plus annual gains to which investors grew accustomed in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Forget it,'' Mr. Arnott said. ''Wake up -- this is a different market.''</p>
