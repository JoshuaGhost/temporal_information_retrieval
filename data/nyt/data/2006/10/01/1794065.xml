        <p>As an avid cyclist and occasional bike-commuter, I was both delighted and disturbed by ''Queasy Rider,'' your Sept. 24 article about the dangers of riding in the city.</p>
        <p>Those of us who ride regularly have seen dramatic improvements to the city's cycling infrastructure in the last few years, and we are hopeful for even more. However, of the seven cyclists shown in the article's four photographs, only one appears to be wearing a helmet.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As an avid cyclist and occasional bike-commuter, I was both delighted and disturbed by ''Queasy Rider,'' your Sept. 24 article about the dangers of riding in the city.</p>
        <p>Those of us who ride regularly have seen dramatic improvements to the city's cycling infrastructure in the last few years, and we are hopeful for even more. However, of the seven cyclists shown in the article's four photographs, only one appears to be wearing a helmet.</p>
        <p>As a group, cyclists cannot expect -- much less demand -- respect and sympathy from motorists and pedestrians when so many of us demonstrate such obvious lapses in judgment.</p>
        <p>On any given day I spot riders who wear headphones, ride against traffic, ride the wrong way on one-way streets, ride on the sidewalk and ride with their helmets strapped to the handlebars. They are a danger not only to themselves, but also to other cyclists like me who must then bear the added perception of guilt by association to understandably wary pedestrians and motorists.</p>
        <p>Tim Macy  Washington Heights</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While the city is to be commended for its efforts to create more so-called bike lanes, these lanes are too narrow and too often occupied by double-parked cars and Fresh Direct trucks. The real solution to making cycling safer and more utilized in the city is to change the mentality of its drivers.</p>
        <p>Drivers should be aware that bicyclists cannot ride on sidewalks, or ride too closely to parked cars in case of suddenly opening doors. Bicyclists should not have to deal with aggressive drivers of half-ton S.U.V.'s who tailgate us while speeding down the street during the morning commute, because they feel that we are riding too slowly and taking up ''their'' space.</p>
        <p>If we are to promote alternative ways of commuting, we need to create a safer bicycling culture.</p>
        <p>Chia-Jen Siao  Upper East Side</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a ''Queasy Rider'' myself, I am disheartened by the words of Iris Weinshall, the transportation commissioner: ''Does it make sense to put a bike lane along Houston Street? Would we have to widen the sidewalks? These are things you consider. Bike riding is not made for everybody.''</p>
        <p>As they say, ''If you build it, they will come,'' which is true whether talking about streets, highways or bike lanes. European cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen have committed themselves to getting people out of their cars and onto bikes, and one-third of commuting trips now taken in these cities are by bike. There is no reason why New York cannot make the same commitment.</p>
        <p>Protected bike lanes, enforcement of laws requiring motorists to share the road and improved roadway surfaces are achievable goals in a city where more people like myself want to ride more, but find daily riding too daunting.</p>
