        <p>The air is suddenly sharper. The scent of newly cut grass has given way to the smokiness of decaying leaves. It's time for finding those scarves and caps and ordering hot chocolate instead of iced tea. It would be hard to find a thicker, richer brew than the one that Angela Ingrao whips up in the back room of Cocoa, her pink and brown closet of a chocolate shop in downtown Larchmont.</p>
        <p>What makes Ms. Ingrao's chocolate extraordinary is that it has only a trace of sweetness, just enough to dull the bitter edge of cocoa and to enhance the intense chocolate flavor. Her base chocolate blocks come from Callebaut in Belgium.</p>

        <p>The air is suddenly sharper. The scent of newly cut grass has given way to the smokiness of decaying leaves. It's time for finding those scarves and caps and ordering hot chocolate instead of iced tea. It would be hard to find a thicker, richer brew than the one that Angela Ingrao whips up in the back room of Cocoa, her pink and brown closet of a chocolate shop in downtown Larchmont.</p>
        <p>What makes Ms. Ingrao's chocolate extraordinary is that it has only a trace of sweetness, just enough to dull the bitter edge of cocoa and to enhance the intense chocolate flavor. Her base chocolate blocks come from Callebaut in Belgium.</p>
        <p>In addition to hot chocolate, she specializes in barks, shards of smooth dark or light chocolate densely packed with almonds, dried cranberries, ginger, chipotle, gummy bears or even fleur de sel, depending on the season. Expect marshmallow and grahams in s'more bark , and candied orange peel and almonds in Sicilian bark.</p>
        <p>The shop also stocks Ms. Ingrao's homemade brownies, a selection of Knipschildt chocolates, white barks (nominally chocolate, because of its low percentage of cocoa), a few preserves, jars of hard candies and novelties like chocolate lip balm.</p>
        <p>To taste all its nuances, chocolate should be eaten at room temperature. Store any extra in the refrigerator, but not for too long. Chocolate should be eaten fresh. No problem there.</p>
        <p>Cocoa, 2107 Boston Post Road, Larchmont. Information at (914) 834-6464; www.cocoachocolateshop.com.</p>
