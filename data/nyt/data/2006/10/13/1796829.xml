        <p>Ex-Governor of Virginia Won't Run for President  Mark Warner, the former Virginia governor who spent the past year working to establish himself as the biggest potential rival to Hillary Rodham Clinton for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, said he would not run for the White House. Mr. Warner had drawn interest among party leaders assessing the potential 2008 field both as a centrist Democrat elected in a Southern state and as a wealthy entrepreneur able to finance his own bid.</p>

        <p>Amish Schoolhouse Is Razed  The one-room Amish schoolhouse in Lancaster County, Pa., above, where 10 girls were shot last week, five of them fatally, was demolished by heavy machinery in the hope of easing the community's pain.</p>

        <p>Mets Get a Jump on St. Louis  The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the National League Championship Series, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals, 2-0, at Shea Stadium. Carlos Beltrán provided the runs with a home run in the sixth inning.</p>

        <p>Stocks Rise as Fed Offers Upbeat View of Economy  Falling gas prices are leaving Americans with more money to spend, and inflation has become less of a threat in recent weeks, according to a report from the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Stock prices surged on the news. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed past 11,900 to close less than 53 points short of 12,000. A separate report showing that the nation's trade deficit reached a record high in August was apparently an afterthought for investors.</p>

        <p>Slain Reporter and Chechnya  A Russian newspaper published the last article by its slain correspondent, and transcripts of videotaped torture sessions of Chechens she had obtained, on the same day that a court issued a ruling holding Russia responsible for the executions of five Chechens in 2000.</p>
