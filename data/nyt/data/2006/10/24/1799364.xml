        <p>Avid iPod users who wonder if they are putting their hearing at risk may find some relief in a new study that tries to arrive at guidelines for safe listening levels.</p>
        <p>The key to avoiding hearing damage, the researchers say, appears to be limiting not so much how long one listens to music but how loud it is played. The study was presented at a recent conference on noise-induced hearing loss in children.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who are audiologists, concluded that the average young person could listen to a player at 70 percent of full volume for four and a half hours without much risk. They also said that if people used the earphones that come with the devices they could listen to music at an 80 percent level for 90 minutes a day without great risk.</p>
        <p>But listening to the music full blast for just five minutes can affect hearing, they said.</p>
        <p>The guidelines, the study said, are generally applicable to other music players. The study also found that it does not much matter whether listeners use headphones that cover the ears or go into them. The real risk, the researchers said, may come when people listening to music do so in a noisy environment. There is a tendency then for them to turn up the volume of the music player. Earphones that block outside noise may be helpful.</p>
        <p>The study was prepared by Brian J. Fligor of Children's Hospital Boston and Harvard, Terri Ives of the Pennsylvania College of Optometry School of Audiology and Cory Portnuff, a graduate student at the University of Colorado.</p>
