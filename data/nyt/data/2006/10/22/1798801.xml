        <p>THE anticlutter impulse keeps landfills brimming with sheets of flimsy plastic. Rather than cram yet another shopping bag beneath the sink, or atop a pantry shelf, many people simply toss it in the trash. It's a wasteful act, to be sure, but the environment is often an afterthought for those who want to keep their kitchens tidy.</p>
        <p>Encouraging the reuse of plastic bags is the purpose of the Binvention, from Sprout Design Ltd. of London. This boxy product makes it slightly easier to turn a grocery tote into a trash receptacle: instead of folding a bag's edges over a garbage can, which can frustrate even the nimble-fingered, you simply drape the bag's handles over the Binvention's two rows of upright pegs. When fully stocked with four bags, the Binvention resembles a filing cabinet filled with sorted rubbish and recyclables in lieu of hanging folders.</p>

        <p>THE anticlutter impulse keeps landfills brimming with sheets of flimsy plastic. Rather than cram yet another shopping bag beneath the sink, or atop a pantry shelf, many people simply toss it in the trash. It's a wasteful act, to be sure, but the environment is often an afterthought for those who want to keep their kitchens tidy.</p>
        <p>Encouraging the reuse of plastic bags is the purpose of the Binvention, from Sprout Design Ltd. of London. This boxy product makes it slightly easier to turn a grocery tote into a trash receptacle: instead of folding a bag's edges over a garbage can, which can frustrate even the nimble-fingered, you simply drape the bag's handles over the Binvention's two rows of upright pegs. When fully stocked with four bags, the Binvention resembles a filing cabinet filled with sorted rubbish and recyclables in lieu of hanging folders.</p>
        <p>The Binvention was conceived for a 2005 exhibition of sustainable designs. ''At the time, we were talking with Tesco about how to reduce the amount of packaging they use,'' said Guy Robinson, one of Sprout's co-founders, referring to a major British retail chain. ''We were really thinking about what we were throwing out of our houses.''</p>
        <p>Among the items tossed away most often, observed Mr. Robinson and his business partner, Robert Brown, were plastic shopping bags. Yet unlike, say, Styrofoam meat containers awash in fetid juices, those bags could easily be repurposed to hold trash, cans or bottles.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Brown discussed patterning the product after a coat rack, with a single row of hooks that could be affixed to a door or wall. But their sketching led them to morph the product into a U-shaped bin built from a single piece of wood -- ''birch plywood from a sustainably managed forest,'' Mr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>The Binvention prototype garnered a top award at the design show in September 2005, and Sprout began exploring whether the product could be commercialized. But using wood was out of the question, as it was too expensive for mass production. Mr. Robinson contacted a British firm called Smile Plastics, which uses recycled shopping bags to manufacture hard plastic, but that material was likewise too pricey.</p>
        <p>Sprout eventually settled on powder-coated aluminum, a choice that forced it to revamp the Binvention's shape. The gentle curve of the prototype's body was abandoned in favor of a more rectangular form, and the feet, once splayed, were made perpendicular to the ground. The final version may not look as elegant as its predecessor, but it allowed Sprout to bring the price down to Â£59, or about $110.</p>
        <p>A LIMITED-EDITION run of Binventions went on sale in the late summer, primarily through Sprout's Web site at sproutdesign.co.uk. Mr. Robinson says it now has about 30 units left, out of 125, though it may produce another batch if interest is strong.</p>
        <p>Sprout also wants to put the Binvention into retail stores, particularly those that regularly saddle customers with lots of plastic bags. But reaching that market, Mr. Robinson says, will require yet another redesign of the product.</p>
        <p>''We're going to compromise again, by doing it in a different material,'' he said. ''This time we're doing it in cardboard and plastic, and putting it in flat-packs.''</p>
        <p>Binventions that must be assembled by the user, he explained, will take up far less space than the current models do, and will thus be easier to ship and stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson and Mr. Brown have even kicked around the idea of making a Binvention out of fabric. Recycled fabric, of course, would be ideal; the same landfills that brim with bags are also replete with worn-out Jockey shorts.</p>
