        <p>WHEN Mayor Michael Bloomberg last month announced a proposal to require restaurants to virtually eliminate trans fats from their food, he made a point of assuring the city that the measure was not paternalistic. ''If you want to eat fries, nobody's taking away your ability to eat fries,'' he argued, clearly aware of the charges of ''nanny state'' that would greet the proposal.</p>
        <p>In fact, the measure is paternalistic -- but that doesn't mean it's inappropriate. Paternalism, the practice of limiting people's choices for their own good, has long been central to public health policy. While it has always been controversial, in recent decades paternalism has become a dirty word to most Americans.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, as the American public health system was taking shape, officials openly invoked paternalism as a rationale for intervention. ''The government of the United States is democratic, but the sanitary measures adopted are sometimes autocratic, and the functions performed by sanitary authorities paternal in character,'' argued Hermann Biggs, the most important official in the New York City health department, a century ago in reference to the detention of tuberculosis carriers. ''We are prepared, when necessary, to introduce and enforce  measures which might seem radical and arbitrary if they were not plainly designed for the public good.''</p>
        <p>Although health officials promoted paternalism as a basis for policy, business owners often protested the approach, claiming it interfered with commerce. In the 1960's and 1970's, rights-based social movements took up the objection to the paternal state as they advocated individual control over decision-making. Thus paternalism became anathema at the same time that individual lifestyles and behaviors came to be seen as the most significant causes of sickness and death.</p>
        <p>As a result, officials who wanted to enact aggressive public health measures had to mask rationales that suggested paternalistic motives. Policymakers justified seat-belt and motorcycle-helmet laws by citing the costs that accidents imposed on society. And even before there was scientific evidence of the hazards of secondhand smoke, those who sought to ban smoking in public argued that they were protecting innocent bystanders.</p>
        <p>In that tradition, Mayor Bloomberg, too, has advanced health measures in the name of protecting vulnerable third parties, as he did when he insisted that the health of employees required a ban on smoking in restaurants and bars. But at times he has also been open about his desire to protect people from their own choices. He described the increase in the cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack as ''the most important measure my administration takes to save people's lives'' -- whether those people wanted their lives saved or not.</p>
        <p>More recently, the mayor has grown bolder. In June he denounced society's ''forbearance, and even social and economic encouragement, of such behavior as tobacco addiction, unhealthy nutrition and excessively sedentary lifestyles.'' An effective public health strategy, he added, ''must therefore alter that calculus by changing how we live.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the trans fat proposal invoke the ''slippery slope'' and ask where such intervention will end. Bans on hot fudge sundaes and double cheeseburgers? It is certainly possible, however, to step onto the slippery slope without sliding down it. To do so requires that we evaluate the burden each public health measure imposes on individual freedom against the reduction it promises in illness and premature death.</p>
        <p>Public health policies that limit individual choice can be justified in a variety of ways. Some prevent people from harming others; some reduce costs to the public; and others simply promote the greatest good for the greatest number.</p>
        <p>But protecting people from their own actions is also a valid rationale. Indeed, if we are honest about it, the most important reason to require the use of seat belts and motorcycle helmets isn't to save taxpayers money but to shield riders from harm. Similarly, tobacco control programs reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, but their ultimate goal is to protect smokers themselves.</p>
        <p>We don't simply encourage people to brush their teeth; we fluoridate the water. When a fire at a chemical storage plant produces a plume of toxic fumes, we order evacuations, even of people reluctant to leave their homes. A caring society does not stand idly by when its members harm themselves.</p>
        <p>Paternalism has an important place in public health. We ought to call it what it is and debate it forthrightly, rather than treating it as the principle that dare not speak its name.</p>
