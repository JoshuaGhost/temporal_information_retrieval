        <p>THE city of Derby has begun demolishing seven buildings that had been the heart of its downtown for much of the last century.</p>
        <p>Mayor Anthony Staffieri said the buildings, on Main Street, were being torn down to make way for a $350 million redevelopment project that would include about 20 new commercial and residential buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Staffieri said the demolition began on Oct. 12 and would continue for six to eight weeks.</p>
        <p>Robert Novak Jr., the executive director of the Derby Historical Society, said the buildings were built between 1850 and 1925. He said they once made up the main shopping district for all of the Naugatuck River Valley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Novak said the largest of the buildings, the Gould Armory, was called Nathan's Hall when it was built in 1850 in what was then known as the Borough of Birmingham.</p>
        <p>''It was the central meeting place,'' he said. ''It was there that slavery was debated, several presidents visited on the campaign trail, people went for entertainment, and Derby residents went for the Civil War and World War I draft lotteries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Novak said the buildings were unusual because they were built on a steep hillside, with three upper floors of stores and offices on Main Street, and three lower floors of apartments extending down the hill and facing First Street.</p>
        <p>''Unlike other buildings of those times, where the tenements were up above, here they were down below,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The city bought the seven buildings, which except for a few businesses had been largely vacant for the last 40 years, over the last seven years for a total of $1 million, Mayor Staffieri said. He said some of the previous owners owed taxes on the buildings.</p>
        <p>''They were in such bad disrepair,'' he said. ''They had become a blight.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Staffieri said the buildings could not be saved.</p>
        <p>''Maybe 20 or 30 years ago they could have been,'' he said. ''But the way the previous owners neglected them and previous administrations ignored them, there was no way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Staffieri said construction of the new buildings would probably begin in a year and take two to three years to complete.</p>
        <p>Mr. Novak said the historical society had saved floorboards and bricks from the buildings and was taking photos of the demolition.</p>
        <p>''That's when you really learn about the buildings' architecture,'' he said. ''That's when they reveal their secrets.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Novak and Mr. Staffieri said they regretted that the buildings were being torn down. But they agreed the city had no choice.</p>
        <p>''It's sad to see them go,'' Mr. Novak said. ''But we're hopeful this will be some rebirth for Derby.''</p>
