        <p>Adventurous (read presumptuous) directors trying to extract modern metaphors from Pietro Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' or Ruggero Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' will have a wrestling match with the culture that made both operas. It didn't really matter that Franco Zeffirelli's 1970 production of this famous double bill was older than some of the people watching it at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday night. It may not be old enough.</p>
        <p>''Cavalleria'' would work as well if not better with painted scenery and without the dog, horse and donkey that Gina Lapinski's updated stage direction brought along to spruce up the evening. ''Pagliacci'' is by design a primitive theater production within a sophisticated theater production. Indeed, if these pieces can lay any claim to deep thinking, it is that they are at once celebrations of tabloid brutality and of a bygone theatrical artifice since supplanted by machines, the wonders of electricity and the lessened imaginations of spectators.</p>

        <p>Adventurous (read presumptuous) directors trying to extract modern metaphors from Pietro Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' or Ruggero Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci'' will have a wrestling match with the culture that made both operas. It didn't really matter that Franco Zeffirelli's 1970 production of this famous double bill was older than some of the people watching it at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday night. It may not be old enough.</p>
        <p>''Cavalleria'' would work as well if not better with painted scenery and without the dog, horse and donkey that Gina Lapinski's updated stage direction brought along to spruce up the evening. ''Pagliacci'' is by design a primitive theater production within a sophisticated theater production. Indeed, if these pieces can lay any claim to deep thinking, it is that they are at once celebrations of tabloid brutality and of a bygone theatrical artifice since supplanted by machines, the wonders of electricity and the lessened imaginations of spectators.</p>
        <p>Mascagni and modern life do share a common impatience. Anyone who is busy and wants to go to an opera should try ''Cavalleria.'' It won't keep you waiting, and it's the only opera I know that may be too short. ''Pagliacci,'' with its clever crossings of line between stage and real life, has memorable music, but beside ''Cavalleria'' -- which acts like a single, sweeping transitive verb -- it suffers lulls. Both pieces concern triangular adultery. (what 19th-century Italian opera doesn't?) Both leave behind a sufficient number of dead bodies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeffirelli's steep steps and church facade in ''Cavalleria'' and open clearing in ''Pagliacci'' are tame stage pictures compared with this famous director's usual upscale tastes. Crowd scenes are everything in these operas, and in Ms. Lapinski's hands choristers amble nicely for Mascagni and show appropriate shock and awe for Leoncavallo.</p>
        <p>In ''Cavalleria,'' Maria Guleghina as Santuzza and Franco Farina as Turiddu turned to the audience and indulged in to-the-death vocal charges. When Ms. Guleghina wasn't overdoing it, she made her points. Mr. Farina translated enthusiasm into persistent sharpness and in general did not enjoy a distinguished evening. Neither principal had much time for the niceties of phrasing. In ensemble moments they paid little attention to each other, much less to their conductor, Marco Armiliato, a fastidious operator who deserved better.</p>
        <p>In ''Pagliacci,'' Patricia Racette and Dwayne Croft as Nedda and Silvio were far more elegant and responsible singers, although their fires didn't burn in this set of ears particularly brightly. As Canio, Salvatore Licitra sounded under stress at the start but eased nicely into this famous tenor role. Ambrogio Maestri was a strong Alfio. Tony Stevenson sang sweetly as Beppe. Others were Tamara Mumford (Lola), Jane Bunnell (Mamma Lucia) and Lado Ataneli (Tonio).</p>
        <p>''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and ''Pagliacci'' are to be performed again tonight at 7:30 and remain in repertory until Feb. 10.</p>
