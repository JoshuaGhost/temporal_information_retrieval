        <p>Upper West Side Co-op  $1,595,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 24A West 90th Street (between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue)</p>
        <p>A two-bedroom, two-bath duplex apartment with a working fireplace and a lovely private garden. Edward Herson, Halstead Property (212) 381-2293; www.halstead.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,084 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: This unusual co-op makes great use of the basement by opening up part of it to the ground floor and giving the basement den 18-foot ceilings. There are plenty of closets and additional storage space, plus a narrow room off the den that could be used as an office.</p>
        <p>CONS: The kitchen and bathrooms, though in good condition, are dated. The railings and catwalk above the basement opening are not very child-friendly.</p>
        <p>Port Jefferson Colonial  $795,000</p>
        <p>SUFFOLK: 108 High Street</p>
        <p>A charming three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonial built in 1855, with harbor views. Details include five fireplaces (two working) with built-in kindling closets. Open house Sunday, 2 to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>Lorin Alvarez (631) 338-2394, and Pat Johnson (631) 384-1133, Jolie Powell Realty; www.jprealtor.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $5,587 a year</p>
        <p>PROS: The owners have added central air, three heat zones, new wiring, plumbing and roof.</p>
        <p>CONS: The second-floor full bath needs updating.</p>
        <p>Financial District Co-op  $769,000</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: 65 Nassau Street (at John Street), #10C</p>
        <p>A one-bedroom, one-bath with a large dining area that could easily be converted to a second bedroom. Richard Rothbloom, Brown Harris Stevens (212) 452-4485; www.brownharrisstevens.com</p>
        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,442 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Nine tall windows in this loftlike corner apartment let in lots of light. The building is just steps from the nine subway lines at the Fulton Street transit hub.</p>
        <p>CONS: The bedroom is open to the living room, affording very little privacy. There is no bathtub.</p>
        <p>Park Slope Co-op  $420,000</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN: 27 Prospect Park West (at Montgomery Place)</p>

        <p>MAINTENANCE: $1,263 a month</p>
        <p>PROS: Fronting on Prospect Park, the apartment has its own set-back entrance. It could legally be reconverted into a doctor's office.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT: 4 Covewood Drive</p>
        <p>A stucco home with four bedrooms, two and a half baths, a new kitchen and a patio, on a dead-end street. Pam Elliott, Wheeler Real Estate (203) 656-6538, www.wheelerrealestatect.com</p>
        <p>TAXES: $9,450</p>
        <p>PROS: Built in 1940, this renovated home offers a charming alternative to the usual colonial design, with gothic-inspired features like rooftop crenelation and arched windows and doorways. The sunken family room has a radiant-heat floor and a wet bar.</p>
