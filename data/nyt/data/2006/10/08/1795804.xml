      <abstract>
        <p>Stanley B Greenberg Op-Ed article says Democrats should take Republican strategy to campaign on US economy and war in Iraq and use it to show how out of touch Republicans are with people's financial worries and how deceptive and incompetent they have been in Iraq war (M)</p>

        <p>KARL ROVE is telling Republicans that they should campaign on the American economy, virtually the ''strongest in the world,'' and on the Iraq war because Republicans will be there for ''the last tough battles,'' while Democrats ''fall back on the party's old platform of cutting and running.''</p>
        <p>Well, do you want to know what I am telling Democrats? Run on the economy and Iraq. We want this battle. This is indeed the strongest economy in the world for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. But there has been so little income growth for so many years that the great majority of citizens face stagnant incomes, growing financial pressures, high health care and gas prices, and jobs with fewer and fewer benefits.</p>

        <p>Well, do you want to know what I am telling Democrats? Run on the economy and Iraq. We want this battle. This is indeed the strongest economy in the world for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. But there has been so little income growth for so many years that the great majority of citizens face stagnant incomes, growing financial pressures, high health care and gas prices, and jobs with fewer and fewer benefits.</p>
        <p>The more Republicans talk about great times, the more they fuel voter frustration with a party out of touch with people's financial worries. And the more Republicans talk about ''cut and run,'' the more voters focus on the ugliness of today's Baghdad. It is as though a smug conservative debate team were so busy winning the argument over setting a withdrawal deadline that it completely missed the consuming national anxiety and anger over the deception and incompetence, the misplaced priorities, the spread of violence and the failure to keep America safe. So, Karl, thank you.</p>
