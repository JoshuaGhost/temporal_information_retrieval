        <p>CONNECTICUT TRANSIT, the state-owned company that operates buses in several cities and towns, said there had been an increase in the number of riders in New Haven and Stamford who bring along their bicycles.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to attract bicyclists onto the bus, the company, a division of the State Department of Transportation, installed bike racks on the front of buses in Stamford in 2001 and in New Haven in September 2004. There is no extra charge to use the racks. Two bikes can fit on each rack.</p>
        <p>According to Connecticut Transit, 4,356 bicycles were put on the racks in Stamford in the first eight months of the year, compared with 3,000 during the same period last year. In 2002, the first full year the racks were in use, 786 people used them in Stamford, the company said. In New Haven, which has more buses and more riders than Stamford, buses carried 11,311 bikes in the first eight months of this year, compared with 7,174 in the same period last year.</p>
        <p>Philip L. Fry, the assistant general manager for planning and marketing for Connecticut Transit, said people were becoming more aware of the racks.</p>
        <p>''Use begets use,'' he said. ''Once people see a bike on the front of a bus, they get the idea to use them.'' He said the company planned to put the racks on Hartford buses next year.</p>
        <p>Ron Kilcoyne, the chief operating officer for the Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority, said all of its buses had racks. He said the authority did not keep track of usage, but it appeared to be increasing.</p>
        <p>''When the racks were first put on two years ago, I hardly saw them being used,'' he said. ''Now, I'm seeing bicycles on them more frequently. Like anything, it takes time to catch on.''</p>
        <p>Sue Knaup, the executive director of Thunderhead Alliance, a national organization in Prescott, Ariz., that advocates bicycle use in conjunction with public transportation, said the number of transit districts that have racks on buses, and the number of people using them, was increasing across the country. She said cities and towns trying to ease traffic congestion and encourage bike use needed to have them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Knaup said different types of people were using the bicycle racks.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing a change from just the bike enthusiasts to regular folks -- the anybodys of America,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Bruce Crowder, 35, an engineer who lives in New Haven and has been taking his bike and the bus to work in North Haven for two years, said the racks were easy to use. He said he would not take the bus if he could not take his bicycle.</p>
        <p>''It's a mile from the bus stop to work, so I probably wouldn't take the bus if I had to walk,'' he said. ''But the racks have opened up the opportunity. Taking the bicycle is good exercise, and I'm saving money on gas.''</p>
