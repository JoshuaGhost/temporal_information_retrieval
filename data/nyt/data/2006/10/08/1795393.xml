        <p>TOBACK--Selma. 92. On October 4, 2006. Beloved and admired by all who knew her, Selma Judith Levy Toback was the embodiment of the kindness and goodness of her mother, Helen Yeamans Levy. She was also, like her father, Joseph Crawford Levy, a brilliant intellect. She held herself to the hightest moral standards while showing boundless understanding and empathy for the shortcomings of those she cared for. A Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude graduate of Smith College, she became a two term President of the League of Women Voters, an organization to which she devoted several decades of time and effort. She moderated political debates on NBC for years. After the untimely death of her sister Miriam, she served as surrogate mother and aunt to her cherished nephew and niece Doug Finn and Jane Finn Levine. She also developed a close and loving relationship with Jane's husband Larry and their children and grandchildren. She had become particularly close to Stephanie during the past several years and her love for her darling Andrei knew no bounds and gave her unexpected and transcendent joy when it was most needed. She was an inspiring and loving wife to Irwin Lionel Toback until his death in 1979. Of James Toback it can only be said: no son has ever been loved more by his mother and no mother has ever been loved more by her son. Service Sunday 9:30 a.m. at Society for the Advancement of Judaism, 15 West 86 St, NYC.</p>
