        <p>Editorial holds race between Democratic incumbent Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and Republican opponent, State Repr Robert Farr, has failed to focus on important issue of uncollected child support</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With all the noise about Connecticut's races for United States senator and governor, it is hard to remember that there are four other significant statewide contests this year: for state comptroller, secretary of the state, treasurer and attorney general. The campaigns thus far have been low-key, and because the incumbents are all well known, the challengers are not given much chance of winning. They must fight for serious attention, not just votes.</p>
        <p>That is regrettable. This is still a democracy, after all. Nobody should be anointed to serve in public office. Elections should be earned after vigorous debate that tests issues and ideas, which in turn makes for more responsive officials and more thoughtful public policies. But that is not happening as it should this year.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="online_lead_paragraph">
        <p>If the race for attorney general were generating more suspense, it would shine a brighter spotlight on serious issues like making parents accountable when they owe child support payments.</p>

        <p>With all the noise about Connecticut's races for United States senator and governor, it is hard to remember that there are four other significant statewide contests this year: for state comptroller, secretary of the state, treasurer and attorney general. The campaigns thus far have been low-key, and because the incumbents are all well known, the challengers are not given much chance of winning. They must fight for serious attention, not just votes.</p>
        <p>That is regrettable. This is still a democracy, after all. Nobody should be anointed to serve in public office. Elections should be earned after vigorous debate that tests issues and ideas, which in turn makes for more responsive officials and more thoughtful public policies. But that is not happening as it should this year.</p>
        <p>Consider the race for attorney general. Important issues that have been raised in this campaign are not getting the attention they deserve because everyone is taking the outcome for granted.</p>
        <p>Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic incumbent, is running for a fifth term. He is popular and is seen as the odds-on favorite. But his Republican opponent, State Representative Robert Farr, is waging a good campaign. A lawyer whose practice has focused on family law, and a 25-year veteran of the legislature, Mr. Farr has focused on the need to make parents accountable when they owe child support payments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farr points out that when Connecticut overhauled its welfare laws, many single parents, nearly all of them women, had to get jobs and could no longer depend on the state for support. But the state did not do enough to ensure that fathers supported their children financially. Mr. Farr says that there is an incredible $1.6 billion in uncollected child support here, more than the amount collected annually in state corporate taxes. The issue involves 110,000 cases, although, he says, parents in about 70,000 cases have made some payment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal disputes these figures, saying that many of those cases are inactive and some go back to the 1970's. He says the issue is complicated because it involves three state bureaucracies, and he has over the years proposed laws to make it easier to collect child support payments.</p>
        <p>Families suffer when irresponsible parents neglect their children. And the state ends up with the bill. If the race for attorney general were generating more suspense, it would shine a brighter spotlight on serious issues like this one.</p>
