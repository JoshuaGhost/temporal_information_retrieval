        <p>Lloyd Cole  ''Antidepressant''  (One Little Indian)</p>
        <p>The intimate scale and wry, self-effacing tone of ''Antidepressant'' are a comfortable fit for Lloyd Cole, a singer-songwriter still best known as the frontman for the Commotions, a 1980's Brit-rock band. It's a mostly homemade effort -- he recorded himself on piano, guitar and drums, and then added some guests -- with lyrics that muse intelligently on the changes and challenges of middle age. Mr. Cole garnishes each song with a sprig of bittersweet humor: in ''The Young Idealists'' he eulogizes the naïveté of a generation that went ''raging through the coffee shops and bars'' before they ''bought into the neo-con economic dream.''</p>

        <p>And even as he paints psychologically detailed domestic portraits, he does a good job of undercutting his own narrative voice. ''With my medication, I will be fine,'' he sings breezily in the title track, and it's anyone's guess how reassuring that line is really meant to be.</p>
