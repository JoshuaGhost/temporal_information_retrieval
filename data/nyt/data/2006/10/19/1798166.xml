        <p>New products often boast of their technical specifications, and Sony's new Altus portable stereo headphones are an example. They have a frequency response usually found only on high-end, professional-quality headphones.</p>
        <p>But most of that technical stuff is of primary interest only to audiophiles. A more instantly understandable feature here is the ''ambient sound-in'' switch, which lets you hear what is happening around you, if you so choose. This could be useful for city dwellers who want to be alert to hear honking taxis while crossing the street.</p>

        <p>The headphones, with the model number MDR-D777, are priced at $150. They can be ordered now at www.sonystyle.com/altus for shipping next week, and will go on sale early next month at other electronic outlets.</p>
        <p>Even before the headphones are available, you can try them out at Sony Style stores. A test drive, even for the audiophiles, is the best way to make a heads-up decision on headphones.</p>
