        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Pascal Plisson  Not rated; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>Set in the highlands of Kenya, a timeless place untouched by modernity, ''Masai: The Rain Warriors,'' is the debut fictional film of Pascal Plisson, a devoted nature documentarian. It is the first film to be solely populated by real-life Masai and spoken entirely in their native tongue.</p>
        <p>That the cast has no previous acting experience is a drawback, but not so hurtful that viewers are pulled out of the faraway world they have entered. Herds of elephants and zebras roam free under endless blue skies and amid landscapes rich with greenery -- though the greens have been digitally altered to appear ocher to reflect the terrible drought that, in this film, has settled on Masai lands.</p>
        <p>''Masai'' follows a group of courageous teenagers who are sent out to secure the mane of Vitchua, the fiercest of all lions, as an offering to the rain gods -- a quest that has recently taken the life of the village's beloved war chief.</p>
        <p>Along the way, the eight boys, a shepherd who accompanies them against his father's wishes, and an older spiritual guide battle a rival tribe and face sickness, death, thirst and starvation, but refuse to turn back.</p>
        <p>Not as morose as it sounds, the film also features playful humor and steady promises of hope. And the boys, like the film, come off as very human: flawed, frequently awkward, but full of goodness at the core.</p>
