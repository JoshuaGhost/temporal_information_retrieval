        <p>Some of the 13 plaintiffs clasped hands, hard, and fidgety children were somehow kept quiet. For about an hour, they waited nervously for news of the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in Lewis v. Harris, their four-year-old lawsuit seeking the right to marry.</p>
        <p>Soon, there were sure to be hugs all around, either in joy or in sorrow.</p>
        <p>Twenty long minutes after the decision was expected on Wednesday afternoon, David S. Buckel, one of their lawyers, announced the split opinion, which was unanimous on one point: that as gay people, they had constitutional rights to equal treatment under the law. A majority of justices ruled that the Legislature had 180 days to clarify the state's policy on marriage.</p>
        <p>The room erupted in a collective ''Huh?''</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Buckel's quick description of the complicated decision began to sink in, the crowd began to sound more optimistic.</p>
        <p>''We're not lawyers -- we're like kids, we want a yes-or-no answer,'' said Diane Marini, 53, of Haddonfield, who had waited with the other plaintiffs in the lunchroom near some of their lawyers' offices in Newark. ''David's face was just so ecstatic, and he's normally not like that. He gave the thumbs up. I would say it's good news.''</p>
        <p>The real benefits of marriage became apparent to Ms. Marini after the death of her partner, Marilyn Maneely, in September 2005.</p>
        <p>''We are second-class citizens,'' said Ms. Marini, a breast cancer survivor who was covered under her partner's health insurance but lost those benefits after Ms. Maneely died. She recently found out that her new insurance will not cover an M.R.I. she needs after results of her mammogram showed a possible recurrence.</p>
        <p>After her partner died at home, Ms. Marini discovered that her own signature was not enough to ensure that the body could be donated to science, as Ms. Maneely had wished.</p>
        <p>''That was something that, even with three sets of lawyers, had slipped through,'' she said. ''There are so many little nuances that people think will never happen.''</p>
        <p>Another plaintiff, Karen Nicholson-McFadden, 40, of Aberdeen, recounted all the expensive legal protections she and her partner, Marcye Nicholson-McFadden, 42, had put in place for their two children: second-parent adoptions, powers of attorney, and separate and therefore more expensive health, car and life insurance policies.</p>
        <p>But most important for their children -- Maya, 3, and Kasey, 7 -- is what she called the ''dignity piece.''</p>
        <p>''With marriage, they can say, 'My parents are going to be together forever,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Mark Lewis, 46, and his partner, Dennis Winslow, 56, Episcopal priests from Union City, said they joined the lawsuit because they grew tired of marrying other couples while never being able to be married themselves, after 14 years together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said he could manage waiting six months to be married.</p>
        <p>''Everyone agreed that our constitutional rights were violated, and the legislative solution has got to be a constitutional one,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Agreeing on a problem is the first step to an effective solution. We're a big step closer for equality for every citizen in the state. That's good news any day.''</p>
        <p>While the plaintiffs generally saw the decision as positive, some gay rights advocates were dissatisfied by the uncertainties it left -- over what the Legislature would do, and whether the new arrangement would even be called marriage.</p>
        <p>At a rally Wednesday night at a Unitarian church in Montclair attended by about 200 people, many in the crowd described the ruling as ''bittersweet.'' Steven Goldstein, chairman of Garden State Equality, which had filed a brief in support of the lawsuit, said in a speech that the ruling ''took us from the back of the bus to only the middle of the bus.'' He said gay marriage -- and he stressed the word marriage -- was ''the only nomenclature that will bring to light the rights we've won today.''</p>
        <p>In New York, where the state's highest court recently passed the question of gay marriage to the State Legislature, Alan Van Capelle, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, said in a statement: ''This is a wonderful day for same-sex couples and their families in New Jersey. We look forward to the day when New York will take the same stand against discrimination and support marriage equality for our families.''</p>
        <p>Other gay people in New Jersey had hoped for a clearer decision.</p>
        <p>''If what the Legislature comes up with is something other than equal marriage, we're going to have to keep fighting battle after battle,'' said Elaine Bennett of Maplewood. ''I know in 20 years, this battle will seem as anachronistic as the interracial marriage battles of the 1950's and 1960's do today. But right now, I'm getting pretty tired of having to explain to people why domestic partnership or civil unions aren't 'just as good as' marriage.''</p>
        <p>Some plaintiffs wondered what would happen if the Legislature's eventual solution did not meet the court's standards of constitutionality, and how long it would be before the state had a clear policy.</p>
        <p>But Cindy Meneghin, 48, of Butler, who has been with her partner, Maureen Kilian, for 32 years, since they met in high school, concluded: ''They agreed that we needed equality, and that means marriage. Everything else is unequal. As far as I'm concerned, we're getting married.''</p>
