        <p>A man was shot and critically wounded -- possibly by a police officer -- early yesterday during a chaotic street fight outside a teenager's birthday party in the Bronx, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man was struck three times, but it was unclear if any of the shots that hit him had been fired by an officer, the police said. The police did not identify the man.</p>
        <p>The shooting began shortly after 3 a.m. outside an apartment building on Clay Avenue at East 174th Street in the Tremont area, the police said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said that a party for a girl's 16th birthday was being held in a basement apartment. They said that two girls began fighting, and then the dispute spread.</p>
        <p>Dozens of people were drinking and shouting in the streets when gunfire rang out, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''They were arguing all night at that party,'' said a neighbor, who gave her name only as Shay, for fear of being hurt by people in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Responding to reports that shots had been fired, officers arrived and saw two men with guns, the police said. Both men started to flee, but one of them fell to the ground after a police officer fired at him, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''The cops shot up in the air,'' said Malika Williams, 26. ''Someone in the crowd turned and fired at the police. A guy was running. The cops warned him to stop. He kept running. The cops fired in the air. Then they shot him.''</p>
        <p>The Police Department's public information office was unable to confirm whether anyone shot at the police. The police said that two handguns were recovered from the scene, a Glock and a Ruger.</p>
        <p>Friends of the wounded man said that his first name was Moe and that he was a former resident of the neighborhood. A sidewalk memorial, marked ''R.I.P. Moe,'' had been erected by late in the day, but the police said the victim was in critical condition at St. Barnabas Hospital.</p>
        <p>Arthur Washington, 48, said he had lent a neighbor his apartment to hold the birthday party in. He handed over his keys and left for the night, returning at 5 a.m. and finding his apartment in shambles, with footprints even on the walls, he said.</p>
        <p>''I came down the street and I saw it all blocked off and I figured out something had gone wrong,'' Mr. Washington said. ''You try to do someone a favor, and look what happens. I'm going to chalk it up as a loss, but I can tell you, never again.''</p>
