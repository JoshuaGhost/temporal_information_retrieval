        <p>POST--Richard M. died from complications at St. Luke's Hospital in New York, after a prolonged illness. Beloved husband of Carol for 45 years. Loving father of Cindy, Steven and Pamela (Kimmel). Adored grandfather of Ethan, Samantha, Jared and Zachary. Loved brother of David. Loved and survived by Noel, Melissa, Andrea, Martin and Katlean. He will be dearly missed by family and so many friends in New York and Florida. Richard was a child prodigy pianist who had his own orchestra and played at major nightclubs before he was sixteen. He became a successful financial advisor, rising to Senior Partner of Zuckerman, Smith and Co. and most recently he set up the Post Group at Merrill Lynch in partnership with his son Steven. He was blessed by being both smart and happy, always with a quick wit. When you were friends with Dick you were friends for a lifetime. Funeral Services will take place at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street at 9:30am on Thursday August 24th.</p>
