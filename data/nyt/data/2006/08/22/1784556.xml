        <p>The wrinkle-fighter Botox can also be useful in preventing scars resulting from cuts to the face, a new study suggests.</p>
        <p>Movement of facial muscles near the wound can make scarring worse, and the Botox temporarily paralyzes the muscles.</p>
        <p>Researchers randomly assigned 31 patients with wounds to the forehead to receive either Botox or a placebo injection right after the wounds were closed. Four of them were caused by trauma and the rest by surgical procedures.</p>
        <p>The lesions were stitched using identical techniques and similar suture thread. The researchers took photographs right after each wound was closed, a week later and six months after that. The study appears in the August issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings.</p>
        <p>Two facial surgeons unconnected with the study assessed the photographs without knowing which wounds had been treated with Botox and which with a placebo. They rated the final cosmetic outcomes on a 10-point scale.</p>
        <p>The average rating for the Botox group was 8.9, and for the placebo group, 7.2, a highly significant difference.</p>
        <p>Botox, or Botulinum toxin, is probably not needed for every facial wound. ''This applies mainly to larger excisions,'' said Dr. Holger G. Gassner, the lead author of the study and now a fellow in facial plastic surgery at the University of Washington. ''And it would certainly apply to traumatic wounds like car accidents and dog bites.''</p>
        <p>The authors recognize that a one-year follow-up may produce different results and that most of the wounds in the study were surgical incisions rather than accidental injuries. ''For a hundred years we've been trying to reduce the effect of muscle pull on scarring,'' Dr. Gassner said. ''Now we can eliminate it.''</p>
