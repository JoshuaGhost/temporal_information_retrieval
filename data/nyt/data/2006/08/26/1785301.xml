        <p>THE growing drumbeat for investing in large-cap stocks reaches ear-splitting volume in the current issue of Smart Money.</p>
        <p>The magazine talked to five big-time investors, and ''there isn't a man on our roster who isn't lusty over big-name stocks, which have been left behind in recent years while smaller stocks have surged ahead,'' Dyan Machan writes.</p>

        <p>THE growing drumbeat for investing in large-cap stocks reaches ear-splitting volume in the current issue of Smart Money.</p>
        <p>The magazine talked to five big-time investors, and ''there isn't a man on our roster who isn't lusty over big-name stocks, which have been left behind in recent years while smaller stocks have surged ahead,'' Dyan Machan writes.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has invested in ConocoPhillips, General Electric and UPS.</p>
        <p>Christopher C. Davis, chairman of Davis Advisors, likes Microsoft, the News Corporation and Wal-Mart. Aetna, Merck and the UnitedHealth Group are the picks of David N. Dreman, investment chief of Dreman Value Management.</p>
        <p>The chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, William H. Miller III, picks Dell, Sears and Yahoo.</p>
        <p>And John Neff, formerly of Vanguard, singles out Citigroup, D. R. Horton and Lyondell Chemical.</p>
        <p>As the magazine notes, ''it's unusual to hear some of the canniest investors all singing a version of the same tune.''</p>
        <p>OOPS -- As part of the 30th-anniversary issue of Registered Rep., the magazine that bills itself as the source for investment professionals, James J. Cramer, the financial celebrity, takes a look back on the online investing craze of the 1990's and concludes that people like him ''got it all wrong.''</p>
        <p>''We thought that the individual investor would storm the ramparts, manage the money himself and take over the world. I, in particular thought that we could turn Wall Street into a Home Depot where the do-it-yourselfers could roam free, taking care of their own money and building up colossal nest eggs.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, it didn't work out that way. ''We ended up costing people fortunes with articles, newscasts and advertising about how simple it was,'' he said. ''The best of us were naïve and the worst of us were self-serving and shameful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer believes that investors who were burned, and those who are new to the market, will learn from the mistakes of the past.</p>
        <p>''They are sober, they know our business and they actually enjoy the process'' of researching and investing in stocks, he writes. But Mr. Cramer doesn't suggest how those who were misled in the past can go about getting their money back.</p>
        <p>ERIN GO BLAH. -- It seemed like a good idea.</p>
        <p>''We are an Irish concept, and we are going everywhere but Ireland. That's crazy,'' Vince Runco, the president for worldwide franchising of Bennigan's Grill and Tavern, told Chain Leader in explaining the company's decision to try to establish a presence in Ireland.</p>
        <p>It has not gone exactly as planned, as David Farkas reports in an article which reminds us that always asking ''is this a good idea,'' should be required before setting off on a new venture.</p>
        <p>Tom Coleman, who owns the franchise rights for all of Ireland, acknowledges he couldn't emulate the Bennigan's restaurants elsewhere, saying ''he'd be laughed out of business were he to plaster his restaurants with shillelaghs and shamrocks,'' Mr. Farkas writes.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Coleman has changed the décor and has altered the standard menu, to the consternation of the parent company, to try to counter the belief that all American restaurants deep-fry their food, which doesn't appeal to the Irish, one local expert told the magazine. In response, Mr. Coleman has altered his offerings to the point where ''his menu is not a Bennigan's menu,'' Mr. Runco complains.</p>
        <p>The menu changes coupled with aggressive promotion -- like offering a movie ticket with the dinner special -- have increased revenue somewhat. But the biggest problem remains the most basic: Irish men and women looking to dine in an Irish restaurant in Ireland prefer a native one.</p>
        <p>FINAL TAKE -- In reporting on the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 16th annual retirement confidence survey, Financial Planning notes ''24 percent of workers were 'very confident' about their retirement prospects, but of that number, 22 percent were not currently saving for retirement, and 39 percent had less than $50,000 in savings.''</p>
        <p>There are two possible explanations: These people have trust funds or a winning lottery ticket, or they are going to be very surprised once they stop working.</p>
