        <p>Scott Proctor was always fiercely competitive, much more than the other kids in his Jensen Beach, Fla., Little League. When he tried to pull an outside pitch, or committed another infraction, his coach would let him know it. It was one voice Proctor did not need right then.</p>
        <p>''He's a perfectionist, and I'm a perfectionist,'' said the coach, Gordon Proctor, Scott's father. ''When he was little, about 9 years old, he said, 'I love baseball, but all you do is yell at me during the games.' I said, 'You know, he's right.' ''</p>

        <p>Scott Proctor was always fiercely competitive, much more than the other kids in his Jensen Beach, Fla., Little League. When he tried to pull an outside pitch, or committed another infraction, his coach would let him know it. It was one voice Proctor did not need right then.</p>
        <p>''He's a perfectionist, and I'm a perfectionist,'' said the coach, Gordon Proctor, Scott's father. ''When he was little, about 9 years old, he said, 'I love baseball, but all you do is yell at me during the games.' I said, 'You know, he's right.' ''</p>
        <p>From then on, Gordon decided he would let his son play, and wait until the drive home to dissect the details. That was when Scott needed and craved another voice.</p>
        <p>''After the games, we'd talk forever,'' Gordon Proctor said. ''And we still do.''</p>
        <p>Those conversations began Proctor's journey to find the mental edge to complement his physical gift of an exploding fastball. Even after a rare three-day break in Seattle, in which he never got into a game, Proctor led American League pitchers in appearances, with 64 going into Friday's game against the Los Angeles Angels.</p>
        <p>''He'll never turn down the ball, that's for sure,'' said the Yankees bullpen coach, Joe Kerrigan. ''We're careful with him, but he's been a lifesaver for us.''</p>
        <p>Proctor, 29, who prepared to be a minor league starter in spring training this season, insists he can handle the physical toll of his job. Staying mentally sharp is the challenge.</p>
        <p>He still talks to his father almost every day, and he bounces ideas off teammates like Mariano Rivera. But the person who helps most is probably Chad Bohling, who joined the Yankees last season as director of optimal performance.</p>
        <p>When Bohling was hired, some Yankees dismissed him. His presence seemed to be an outgrowth of the hoary motivational sayings that cover the walls of Legends Field on orders from the principal owner, George Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in it,'' Gary Sheffield said of Bohling's hiring. ''I think it's for people who are weak-minded.''</p>
        <p>Bohling is based in Tampa, Fla., and usually does not travel with the team. When he showed up in the clubhouse last season, he seemed to have little to do. But this season, especially, Proctor has taken to him.</p>
        <p>After a game one night, Proctor carried several DVD's that Bohling prepared for him. Two featured roundtable forums with top athletes -- including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and the Yankees' Derek Jeter -- discussing their mental approach.</p>
        <p>Another, which Proctor carries on every road trip, is a personal highlight reel set to songs like ''Eye of the Tiger,'' with positive comments from broadcasters piped in.</p>
        <p>Proctor and Bohling communicate often, talking on the phone or sending text messages. After Proctor pitched in both games of a doubleheader last Friday in Boston, he found a text message waiting from Bohling: ''Good job, stay strong.''</p>
        <p>General Manager Brian Cashman hired Bohling and does not allow him to speak to reporters. But for a team with multiple bullpen catchers, batting practice pitchers, a strength coach and a full-time massage therapist, it made sense to have a mental-skills coach.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to provide every resource possible to put our players in the best position to reach optimal levels of performance on a consistent basis,'' Cashman said. ''Chad is another resource for players to utilize if they choose.''</p>
        <p>Bohling's lessons, and those from Proctor's father, who runs an accounting firm in Florida, have become ingrained in Proctor's psyche. After bad games, he said, he may think of his father's advice: everybody fails, but the best never dwell on it.</p>
        <p>Proctor was drafted by the Mets out of high school but opted to go to Florida State before being drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He spent five years in the Dodgers' farm system before the Yankees acquired him for Robin Ventura in 2003.</p>
        <p>The next July, he struck out Boston's Nomar Garciaparra in the sixth inning of a one-run game at Fenway Park. The moment was lost in the mayhem of a day that included a brawl and a game-ending home run, but it had enormous value for Proctor.</p>
        <p>''When I honestly felt like I could pitch here was when I came in to face Nomar,'' Proctor said. ''I was successful, and it gave me the confidence to know, 'O.K., I can do this.'</p>
        <p>''And then from there, you go out and you struggle and you doubt yourself. But Chad talks about just trying to stay off that emotional roller coaster: 'Hey, I'm only human, I'm going to screw up, I'm going to go out there and give it up.'</p>
        <p>''When you're warming up and you have a bad thought go through your head -- 'Oh no, it's a one-run game, I can't give up any runs' -- you step off and say, 'That's not going to benefit me. All I've got to do is take one pitch at a time, throw strikes; the pressure's on him.' It's just transferring the pressure from what I feel myself and putting it on the hitter. He's got to hit the round ball with the round bat and hit it square.</p>
        <p>''You know,'' Proctor concluded, ''I'm not easy to hit.''</p>
        <p>It seemed that way through May 20, when Proctor had a 1.84 earned run average and earned the trust of Manager Joe Torre. Over his next 21 games, though, his effectiveness waned. From May 23 through July 4, his E.R.A. was 7.99. His ability to reverse that trend and settle back into a groove (he has a 1.57 E.R.A. since) has impressed his teammates.</p>
        <p>''You can tell a lot more about people when they struggle as opposed to when they do well,'' Jeter said. ''He never changed, and he bounced back.''</p>
        <p>Proctor uses more off-speed pitches than he did in past years, but the biggest improvement has been his command. That, says catcher Jorge Posada, is where his growing confidence shows itself.</p>
        <p>''The stuff was always there,'' Posada said. ''When you have a guy who's got that confidence, that good mentality, they're a lot crisper. They can put the ball where they're supposed to put it. Execution, location -- everything behind it is thrown with a purpose.''</p>
        <p>Proctor missed time at the end of spring training when his newborn daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart condition. The baby needed an operation to repair a constricted aortic arch in her heart.</p>
        <p>After five days away from the team, Proctor flew to Oakland, Calif., from Florida where the Yankees opened the season. He lost in his first appearance, on April 4, and nobody blamed him. ''He never makes any excuses,'' Cashman said, ''but it was unfair to expect him to succeed at that moment.''</p>
        <p>Proctor, whose daughter is healthy now, said his family helped him focus by giving him a pleasant distraction from baseball. But the credit keeps coming back to the wisdom of Bohling and his father, who have nurtured the mind of the league's most durable pitcher.</p>
        <p>''Most guys that come up here -- really, all these guys -- have the ability to pitch up here,'' Proctor said. ''But it's the mental side that is going to make you successful and keep you here.''</p>
