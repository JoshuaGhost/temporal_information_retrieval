        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) KATRINA: THE LONG ROAD BACK  Brian Williams (above, shown last year), in his 11th visit to New Orleans, looks at the destruction around the city, the community's reaction to the storm and how, a year later, survivors' lives have changed.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) PRISON BREAK  Utah, ho! Abruzzi, Sucre and C-Note go their separate ways, together for now; Tweener hitches a ride with a college co-ed, and T-Bag visits a veterinarian. Meanwhile, Michael and Lincoln, still reeling from overhearing Veronica's execution, plan another breakout, this time sans tattoo.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (E!) FASHION POLICE: THE 2006 EMMY AWARDS  The good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC Family) KYLE XY  DNA match? In this season ender, a couple claiming to be Kyle's real parents show up to take him home. But can they explain the umbilical cord problem?</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TNT) THE CLOSER  Grab that cat, fast! Estelle, Pope's fuming ex-wife, reveals Pope and Brenda's affair to their team -- and leaves Fritz (Jon Tenney) wondering where his own relationship with Brenda (Kyra Sedgwick) really stands.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sundance) HELEN'S WAR: PORTRAIT OF A DISSIDENT  During the 1970's and 80's, Dr. Helen Caldicott (right) devoted her life to the elimination of nuclear weapons. And then she retired to Australia, before being motivated by American politics to set out anew on her mission. In this documentary, Anna Broinowski follows her aunt around the United States as she takes up arms again.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) VANISHED  It's all in the timing, isn't it? Now that Senator Jeffrey Collins's wife has been kidnapped, his exwife, played by Penelope Ann Miller, tries to, er, reconnect.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) CIRCLE OF FRIENDS  A widow (Julie Benz) returns to her hometown, where she comes to believe that her husband's death has a lot to do with the mysterious demise of several of her old classmates.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Sundance) TRANSGENERATION  In this reunion follow-up to last year's series, four transgendered college students -- Gabbie and Raci, men living as women, and Lucas and T. J., women living as men -- talk about life now that the cameras are gone.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) WEEDS  ''I know you're a drug dealer.'' And with those words last week from her recently ex D.E.A. agent boyfriend, Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker, right) had a whole new set of worries. Count 'em in tonight's episode, including puberty and the Nation of Islam.</p>
