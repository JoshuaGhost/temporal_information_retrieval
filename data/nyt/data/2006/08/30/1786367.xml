        <p>''Solved!'' declared the front page of The Daily News on Aug. 17, the day after an arrest was made in the decade-old JonBenet Ramsey murder case.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, almost sheepishly, a small headline across the bottom of the page read: ''JonBenet case collapses in shambles.''</p>
        <p>It was a day of delicate backtracking for the news organizations and television programs that, two weeks earlier, had breathlessly announced the news that John Mark Karr had been arrested in the death of JonBenet Ramsey. News of Mr. Karr's arrest had landed on the front pages of newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, and filled hundreds of hours on the cable talk shows that had obsessively covered the case from its beginning in 1996.</p>
        <p>On Monday, however, Mary T. Lacy, the Boulder County district attorney, announced that charges against Mr. Karr would be dropped after tests revealed that his DNA sample did not match the unidentified DNA found on JonBenet Ramsey. ''They all are embarrassed by this, all the TV people, all the journalists,'' said Barry Scheck, a director of the Innocence Project. ''I sense a general embarrassment in the media because there was a complete fixation on this case.''</p>
        <p>When the news of Mr. Karr's arrest broke, cable talk shows jumped in headfirst, interviewing members of the Ramsey family, relatives of Mr. Karr and fellow teachers at the school in Thailand where Mr. Karr had been briefly employed. An old yearbook signed by Mr. Karr materialized, and experts were produced to compare his handwriting with the handwriting on the supposed ransom note left in the Ramsey home in 1996.</p>
        <p>For a cluster of criminal justice programs, the first order of business was to absolve the long-suspected Ramsey parents of responsibility for the crime. ''This is a tragedy of Shakespearean proportion,'' said Jane Velez-Mitchell, a host on CNN. ''What is absolutely so sad about this is that Patsy Ramsey, the mother of little JonBenet Ramsey, died just a couple of months ago at the end of June, never having achieved full vindication, living for so many years, the better part of a decade, under a cloud of suspicion.''</p>
        <p>But other news organizations quickly began questioning Mr. Karr's claims that he ''was with JonBenet when she died.'' By Aug. 17, the day after Mr. Karr's arrest, some news outlets were interested in debating the psychology of phony confessions. In Slate, a headline wondered, ''Why make a false confession?''</p>
        <p>John M. Geddes, a managing editor of The New York Times, said he believed the arrest was played appropriately. ''We had all the doubts and concerns that were arising within the first 24 hours reflected in the paper the next day,'' Mr. Geddes said.</p>
        <p>Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post, said he was immediately suspicious of Mr. Karr's behavior after watching the video from Thailand. ''As a journalist, I had questions right from the beginning about whether he was the right guy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Looking back, Mr. Downie said he is satisfied with the paper's coverage. ''If you read our stories, you'll see a lot of skepticism from the beginning,'' he said. ''It's all throughout our stories. I don't think you could read our stories without feeling that there was at least a 50-50 chance that it was the wrong guy.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone was willing to declare Mr. Karr innocent of the crime. The front page of The New York Post yesterday pictured a stony-faced Mr. Karr beside the headline, ''Off the hook: DNA clears 'killer' Karr.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Grace, a CNN talk show host, continued to call Mr. Karr a confessed killer on her show Monday night, after the news that charges against him had been dropped. ''Bombshell, John Mark Karr, the confessed killer of JonBenet Ramsey, has walked,'' she said. ''It was all for naught.''</p>
        <p>Media ethicists, citing journalistic missteps in the accusations against Richard A. Jewell over the bombing at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, immediately questioned the renewed attention that news organizations placed on Mr. Karr.</p>
        <p>Bob Steele, who teaches ethics at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, said there was a rush to judgment over Mr. Karr's involvement. ''There were headlines on cable news shows that directly said or implied that the case was solved,'' Mr. Steele said. ''That was journalistically problematic, and it was ethically suspect to do that. The pieces of the puzzle were incomplete when the Karr story broke.''</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of unnamed sources flying around in that first week, and that's really dangerous,'' he added. ''There were some sources saying, 'This is the guy, we have him nailed.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheck of the Innocence Project appeared on ABC's ''Nightline'' Monday night to discuss the Ramsey case and immediately laced into the anchor, Terry Moran, over excessive media attention to the Karr arrest.</p>
        <p>''Maybe if we didn't pay so much attention to it and blow this story out of proportion and paid attention to the important things, maybe everybody wouldn't feel so weird about it today,'' Mr. Scheck said.</p>
        <p>''Well, thank you,'' Mr. Moran said uncomfortably. ''Thank you for that advice, Barry.''</p>
