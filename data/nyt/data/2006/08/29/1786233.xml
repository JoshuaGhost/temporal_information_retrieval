        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Mission Unaccomplished'' (editorial, Aug. 24) describes the welfare reform that began 10 years ago. The grade is incomplete as long as millions of single parents live in poverty, working sporadically or part time at a series of low-wage jobs.</p>
        <p>A $5 million welfare-to-work demonstration in the Clinton administration (which I directed at Johns Hopkins) showed one way to move toward completing the task. The strategy was to support the relationship between the worker and her supervisor.</p>
        <p>As workers demonstrated responsibility and acquired skills, their bosses rewarded them with better work schedules, promotions and higher pay. Former hard-to-serve welfare recipients stayed on the job for a year and more. Their earnings increased by up to 20 percent within a year and 28 percent over two years.</p>
        <p>Those who stayed on the job for 12 months averaged earnings of $14,676 a year; retention of 24 months produced average yearly earnings of $17,264.</p>
        <p>Adding the earned income tax credit and food stamps brought families of three well beyond the federal poverty line -- a goal that will accomplish the mission of reforming welfare.</p>
        <p>Arnold Packer  Baltimore, Aug. 24, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer was assistant secretary of labor in the Carter administration.</p>
