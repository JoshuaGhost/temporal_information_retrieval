        <p>A federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that it was unconstitutional for Delaware to deny public documents to nonresidents under a provision of the state's Freedom of Information Act.</p>
        <p>The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, affirmed an earlier decision by a Federal District Court in Wilmington.</p>
        <p>In 2003, Matthew Lee, a consumer advocate and lawyer who lives in New York, sued the State of Delaware for denying him access to documents related to a nationwide settlement with the consumer lender, Household International, after the company was investigated for deceptive lending practices.</p>
        <p>''We sought the records to be able to show how widespread the problem of predatory lending was within Household,'' said Mr. Lee, who is also the publisher of Inner City Press, a nonprofit Bronx newsletter about the practices of banking and financial services companies.</p>
        <p>M. Jane Brady, then the Delaware attorney general, denied Mr. Lee access to records regarding her handling of the settlement. Ms. Brady cited a provision of the state's Freedom of Information Act law limiting access to records ''to any citizen of the state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee then sued asserting that the denial of access to state records interfered with his right to work as a journalist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brady, now a Delaware Superior Court judge, argued at the time that the provision was constitutional because it helped ''define the political community and strengthen the bond between citizens and the state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee's lawyer, David C. Vladeck of the Georgetown University Law Center, said that Wednesday's decision, ''was the first court ruling on the constitutionality of a state statute that limits access to public records to citizens of that state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vladeck said the court called its ruling ''precedential,'' signaling the importance of the case and the expectation that it would be followed by other states in the Third Circuit, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which have similar restrictions.</p>
        <p>In the 17-page decision, Judge D. Brooks Smith, writing for the three-judge circuit panel, said, ''Delaware's public records law discriminates on its face between citizens and non-citizens.''</p>
        <p>''Although the state has a substantial interest in 'defining its political community,' the citizens-only provision'' of the law bore no ''substantial relationship to that interest,'' Judge Smith wrote.</p>
        <p>Delaware's current attorney general, Carl C. Danberg, said Wednesday that he would not appeal. ''We consider the matter closed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It was our obligation to defend the statute of the State of Delaware because this issue had never been addressed by the Third Circuit or the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Danberg said.</p>
        <p>While he said the state had been processing other freedom of information requests to comply with the earlier ruling, Mr. Danberg said that Mr. Lee would still not receive the Household documents because they were protected under a separate Delaware law by an ''investigative file privilege.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee was surprised by the news and called the decision ''an outrage.''</p>
        <p>He questioned why he could not receive the documents, particularly, he said, ''because other states have given us reams of documents about their settlements on predatory lending with Household.''</p>
