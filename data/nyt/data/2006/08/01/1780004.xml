        <p>In a bathroom, a basement, and a storage room full of yarn, people in this embattled southern town waited for the bombs to stop. They ate pieces of bread, and the grain that they had in their cupboards. Days passed. Food ran out. They began to lose track of time.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the first day of a sharp curtailment of Israeli airstrikes, dozens of people emerged, squinting in the searing sun at a scene of destruction so complete that they barely understood what they were looking at.

        <p>In a bathroom, a basement, and a storage room full of yarn, people in this embattled southern town waited for the bombs to stop. They ate pieces of bread, and the grain that they had in their cupboards. Days passed. Food ran out. They began to lose track of time.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the first day of a sharp curtailment of Israeli airstrikes, dozens of people emerged, squinting in the searing sun at a scene of destruction so complete that they barely understood what they were looking at. Their town had been crushed, its very heart torn out and pulverized into a chalky dust.</p>
        <p>Similar scenes unfolded across southern Lebanon on Monday, as people took advantage of the relative calm to move, seeking safety farther north. They piled onto tractors, packed into cars, crowded children into open trunks, and even walked, lugging belongings on their backs. They traveled despite Israeli shelling along the border that popped and boomed.</p>
        <p>Those who could were getting out of the town, though many who were elderly, infirm or lacking the means remained stuck. Roads in the south and the east had many more cars than usual, and in some places, long lines formed. The road south from Tyre along the coast was heavily traveled. Clumps of cars sped by at regular intervals on several roads that led away from the fighting. The dead were brought out, too. The Red Cross in Tyre, the largest city in Lebanon's south, said it retrieved 23 bodies from rubble in southern villages on Monday.</p>
        <p>Israeli soldiers had besieged Bint Jbail, a town in the center of southern Lebanon, for a week, battling Hezbollah forces in what has been some of the fiercest fighting of the war. An antiaircraft gun trimmed with a Hezbollah flag stood in the center of town on Monday, a monument of sorts.</p>
        <p>Large buildings had folded in on themselves. Roofs were on the ground. Chunks of concrete and power lines were piled waist-high. Cars were on their backs like turtles. Strings of colorful flags advertising a shopping festival were wrapped around a four-foot-long unexploded Israeli bomb.</p>
        <p>The Israelis said they agreed to stop airstrikes for 48 hours, except in cases of an imminent threat or to support ground troops, to let people in southern Lebanon evacuate. But in Bint Jbail, leaving the town required climbing mountains of rubble, something that was physically impossible for most of the people who had been stranded.</p>
        <p>Off a pathway covered with chunks of concrete and pieces of building, two older Lebanese women and a terrified Sri Lankan maid sat in a basement filled with yarn. The cardboard that coated the floor reeked of urine. Flies buzzed on a pile of grimy blankets.</p>
        <p>''Who will take me out?'' said Seriya Hamma, a 65-year-old woman with a black head scarf.</p>
        <p>Several volunteers, Red Cross workers and Lebanese Army soldiers climbed inside, hoisting the other older woman, Fatma Baidoun, onto a ladder covered with pillows.</p>
        <p>Strangers met by accident and stayed together. Women from the Baidoun and Ayub families met during a search for a safer place to live. They moved seven times over 19 days, said Namad Baidoun, who walked over slabs of concrete, diapers, and pieces of metal along the main street in a pair of slippers, crying and appealing to anyone who would hear her as she was being led out by rescue workers.</p>
        <p>''There were 35 people together'' in their hiding place, she shouted in a high voice. Later, in a hospital in Tibnin, she described the small bathroom that she, her sister, and at least five small children shared for days, while they waited for rescue.</p>
        <p>The bombing was so fierce that many did not venture outside at all since it began, nearly three weeks ago. A store whose shelves were stocked with food was open to the street, its windows broken. The food was untouched, even though many who were brought out said they had not had food for several days.</p>
        <p>More than anything, people were afraid of losing their shoes. Ahmed Daibis, a blind man in a blue cap and striped pants, was standing in a room near a couch, turning around and asking a volunteer who found him to help him look for his shoes. Alia Bazeh, an elderly woman who had been carried out of the rubble on someone's back, asked repeatedly for her sandals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daibis insisted on locking the door to his house. His sister, who was found earlier, had described to rescuers in a pleading tone where he was. He was carried more than half a mile over the jumble of industrial trash to the center of town, where a few ambulances were driving survivors out. A kitten mewed from a bombed-out building.</p>
        <p>At Tibnin Hospital, the Baidoun and Ayub women sat crammed together on a wooden bench in a hallway. Five children crawled on their laps. One of the women said her foot was injured. She was not wearing shoes. A soldier walked by and she asked for food.</p>
        <p>Even if the war ended immediately, it would take rescue workers weeks to dig bodies out of the rubble because of the scale of the devastation. Namad Baidoun said a neighbor was still buried under the rubble of his crushed house. In all, rescue workers pulled nine bodies out of Bint Jbail on Monday, the Red Cross said, though dozens, if not hundreds, are still assumed to be dead and trapped.</p>
        <p>Bodies are lying near roads as well. Just past Bint Jbail, emergency workers stood inspecting the body of a man they said was a Lebanese soldier. He was killed by shrapnel some days ago. Dogs had eaten away the left side of his body.</p>
        <p>After so many days inside, Monday's rescue was a return to sunlight and life.</p>
        <p>''We heard a noise, we heard voices,'' said Rowda Bezzah, 45, who had been hiding in a house with about 20 people. ''We ran outside.''</p>
