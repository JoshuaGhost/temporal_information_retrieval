        <p>Not unlike a comic book supervillain, little is known about the Motokrzr K1, Motorola's latest ultraslim fashion phone, except that it's wanted around the world.</p>
        <p>This 4-ounce phone features the same metal cladding as Motorola's previous phones, as well as a metallic keypad and a 2-inch color display. The phone supports a fast cellular networking system called Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) and includes a 2-megapixel camera and micro-SD card slot for memory expansion.</p>

        <p>Not unlike a comic book supervillain, little is known about the Motokrzr K1, Motorola's latest ultraslim fashion phone, except that it's wanted around the world.</p>
        <p>This 4-ounce phone features the same metal cladding as Motorola's previous phones, as well as a metallic keypad and a 2-inch color display. The phone supports a fast cellular networking system called Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) and includes a 2-megapixel camera and micro-SD card slot for memory expansion.</p>
        <p>The phone is a half-inch thick and slightly smaller than the Razr. One charge gives about three hours of talk time and about 10 days of standby.</p>
        <p>The mysterious Motokrzr K1 should be available within the next month, although the exact introduction, carrier and even price are still closely guarded secrets. Because it is a quad-band G.S.M. phone -- which means that it can be used in most countries -- the carrier will probably be either Cingular Wireless or T-Mobile in the United States.</p>
        <p>Expect to see it pressed to the ears of the fashionable in the next few months.</p>
