        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Left or Right, Israelis Are Pro-War'' (front page, Aug. 9):</p>
        <p>There is a continuing, vocal and visible Israeli opposition to the war.</p>
        <p>Every day, the Women Against War Movement holds vigils in three cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa -- yes, Haifa, even under shelling.</p>
        <p>Every Saturday, we hold mass marches through Tel Aviv, the most recent one 5,000 strong.</p>
        <p>Several men have refused call-ups to serve in Lebanon, and a dozen young men and women were arrested on Aug. 8 for blocking the road to an air force base in an effort to prevent, in their words, the carrying out of more war crimes.</p>
        <p>Haaretz is filled with articles criticizing the war not because it is going poorly but because the idea of preventing aggression by bombardment is both ludicrous and immoral.</p>
        <p>These acts of criticism represent the views of thousands more, and if the war continues, they will also be out on the streets. Let's hope that it will end before that is necessary.</p>
        <p>Gila Svirsky  Jerusalem, Aug. 9, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is co-founder of the Coalition of Women for Peace.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Arab Reformers Are on Defensive'' (front page, Aug. 9):</p>
        <p>That even Arab ''reformers'' say ''the issue of Arab land occupied by Israel'' is the ''taproot'' of Arab extremism, as you report, explains why most Israelis support this war.</p>
        <p>Israel pulled out of southern Lebanon six years ago and out of Gaza last year. Four months ago, Ehud Olmert told a group of us in Jerusalem just after his election as prime minister that withdrawal from the West Bank that ''will allow for a contiguous Palestinian state alongside Israel'' is ''our main goal, the reason for this government.''</p>
        <p>Israelis were looking forward to leaving the West Bank when they were suddenly forced by Hezbollah to go back into Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The international community must eliminate the threat that Hezbollah poses to Israel, enabling Israel to pull out of Lebanon again. This will pave the way for Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
        <p>And that would cut off the taproot of Arab extremism.</p>
        <p>Seymour D. Reich  David M. Elcott  New York, Aug. 9, 2006</p>
        <p>The writers are president and executive director, Israel Policy Forum.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Arab reformers are quick to blame United States policies for the failure of democratic change to take hold in the region. But the moderates were isolated long before the current crisis in Lebanon began.</p>
        <p>The daily barrage of rockets unleashed by Hezbollah illustrate that extremists have the weaponry and the manpower, not to mention state sponsorship.</p>
        <p>In a region where violence is too often the preferred method of expression, the reformers' ideals are no match.</p>
        <p>Matthew Wolin  Teaneck, N.J., Aug. 9, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The problem is not that we support Israel today when it is in the right, but that we supported it in the past when it was in the wrong.</p>
        <p>We were wrong to support Israel's building of illegal settlements. That has created the impression that we'll stand by Israel no matter what it does. Now that Israel really needs and deserves our support, our ability to give that support is compromised.</p>
