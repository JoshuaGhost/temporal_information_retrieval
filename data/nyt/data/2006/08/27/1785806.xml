        <p>Editorial endorses Mark Green over Andrew Cuomo in Democratic primary race for New York State attorney general</p>

        <p>If there are excellent Democratic candidates for governor this year, the race to succeed Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is a lot more contentious and a lot less promising. But there's little question that the former public advocate, Mark Green, is the candidate whose experience and record best fit this job.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, this race has been a contest between Mr. Green and Andrew Cuomo, the former secretary of housing and urban development. Two other candidates, Sean Patrick Maloney and Charlie King, are interesting politicians who have little chance to win this particular contest.</p>

        <p>If there are excellent Democratic candidates for governor this year, the race to succeed Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is a lot more contentious and a lot less promising. But there's little question that the former public advocate, Mark Green, is the candidate whose experience and record best fit this job.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, this race has been a contest between Mr. Green and Andrew Cuomo, the former secretary of housing and urban development. Two other candidates, Sean Patrick Maloney and Charlie King, are interesting politicians who have little chance to win this particular contest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's credentials start with an impressive record of protecting consumers, which should be a major part of the attorney general's portfolio. As New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs and later the city's first elected public advocate, Mr. Green has taken on his share of big corporations, including Joe Camel and the tobacco industry. He has been a trailblazer in public interest law and political reform, and has fought to protect civil rights and the environment, raising the sort of legal issues that a strong state attorney general would, and doing so with skill and fairness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo's record at HUD was mixed, and is one cause of our concern about how he would handle the job of attorney general. Before Mr. Spitzer restored it to top professional status, the office was a nesting place for political hacks. It would be unfortunate to see it politicized again by any attorney general whose chief concern was burnishing a political resume. And during Mr. Cuomo's time in the Clinton cabinet, his first concern did not always seem to be housing. As he left HUD, Mr. Cuomo's operation produced a 150-page report of his accomplishments that included a CD and pictures of the secretary with celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker. It cost the taxpayers a whopping $688,000 to produce what amounted to future campaign fodder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo did make gains in housing for the homeless at the huge agency, but there were real problems with his performance. For New Yorkers, the worst failure was insufficient oversight of a federal housing rehabilitation program so overrun by dishonest appraisers, brokers and lenders that it devastated parts of Brooklyn and Harlem. Mr. Spitzer even sued one participant in this program during the Cuomo years and cited ''massive fraud'' that was increasing neighborhood blight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green has run for a lot of offices and has frequently been undone by his prickly personality. But when elected, he has always repaid voters by doing the job well. For attorney general in the Democratic primary, we recommend Mark Green.</p>
