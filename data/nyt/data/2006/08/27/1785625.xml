        <p>ED KLEEFIELD, who is known as Jean Luc and who owns Jean-Luc on Columbus Avenue in Manhattan, has made a big splash in the Hamptons. This summer he opened his fourth East End spot: Mumbo Gumbo in Sag Harbor.</p>
        <p>Each of Mr. Kleefield's restaurants -- the others are JL East in East Hampton, JLX Bistro in Sag Harbor and Madame Tong's in Southampton -- has an appealing atmosphere, but none is as much fun as Mumbo Gumbo. This Cajun barbecue joint keeps things lively, with zydeco music in the background and lots to look at.</p>
        <p>One wall is covered with posters of vintage country and rock stars: Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Elvis. Another displays huge black-and-white photographs of old Sag Harbor. Everywhere there are sea creatures, from big red statues of lobsters to a stuffed sailfish mounted on one wall. Add a few pig sculptures, about a half-dozen plasma televisions, leopard-patterned rugs, a pressed tin ceiling, shiny white subway tiles and wood-and-leather booths, and you've got an eyeful.</p>
        <p>The staff, wearing jeans or denim miniskirts topped with the restaurant's logo T-shirts, is very friendly; on our second visit at least three people welcomed us back. Warmth and smiling faces go a long way toward making up for laid-way-back service. No one has a clue as to who ordered what; when we chose the ribs, no one asked what sauce we wanted with them, and we had to hail our waitress so we could tell her.</p>
        <p>The crowd is just as casual as the service, with lots of shorts and flip-flops, and even on Saturday evening the restaurant was full of children. One night a toddler sat on top of the bar eating corn bread, drinking a Coke and delighting his mother and the other adoring women who had gathered around him. (There is a children's menu of a half-dozen entrees, each around $5.)</p>
        <p>That little boy seemed to enjoy his dinner, but for the adults in the room, the food was decidedly mixed. The dish everyone at my table wanted -- the baby back ribs -- was disappointing, while the fish, which I normally would go out of my way to avoid at a barbecue place, was a hit. About those ribs: They were smoky and tasty but not nearly tender enough. A combo of ribs and chicken was especially dismal; a half chicken (white meat dry, dark meat juicy) dominated the plate, with only three ribs squeezed in beside it. Though mostly chicken, it cost just $2 less than a full slab of ribs would have.</p>
        <p>If the baby back ribs deserved a grade of C, the braised short ribs, a special, earned an F. Short ribs should be fork-tender; this tough dinosaur bone needed much more braising time. We knew we were in trouble when the manager brought us a steak knife.</p>
        <p>Who would have thought fish was the thing to order? The snowy white cod in the fish and chips was coated with a light beer batter, and the Cajun grilled fish (salmon, the night we tried it) was succulent and flaked at the touch of a fork.</p>
        <p>Among the handful of sandwiches available, top honors went to the platter of two juicy mini bayou burgers with a mountain of crisp, slim French fries. Moist, smoky pulled pork on a sesame bun with a clump of cole slaw needed some fries to round out the plate, and the fried oyster po' boy was skimpy: instead of the traditional long roll piled with crunchy oysters, we were given a hamburger bun holding just five.</p>
        <p>First courses, too, had their ups and downs. You can skip the salads, since the Caesar had no croutons and the iceberg lettuce wedge was limp. And the shrimp and corn chowder, though flavorful, had no shrimp. Instead, try the spicy seafood gumbo or the jambalaya, an equally zingy amalgam of rice, chicken and sausage. The crayfish cakes had a nice chunky texture, and the peel-and-eat shrimp -- seven good-size ones -- were even better when dunked in a dip of melted butter and hot sauce. The deviled egg appetizer also went over well at my table. The single order (six halves) was enough to share, and it brought back memories of family dinners years ago.</p>
        <p>So did the desserts. Well, except for the apple crumb and peach crumb pies, which we couldn't tell apart; they were so overloaded with crumbs and cinnamon. But I loved the pies -- sweet potato, pecan and tangy Key lime -- and the lush red velvet cupcakes crowned with swirls of cream cheese frosting.</p>
