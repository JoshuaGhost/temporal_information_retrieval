        <p>WHEN visitors used to ask Robin Chesmer what happened to the milk from his cows at Graywall Farms in Lebanon, he would tell them he didn't know. Now he tells them to look for the Farmer's Cow label at grocery stores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesmer and five other dairy farmers in eastern Connecticut started selling milk under their own label in Stop &amp; Shop stores 10 months ago. This summer, Big Y and Shaw's also started selling the Farmer's Cow label. The company said the milk does not have growth hormones and was selling best in Fairfield County and in the eastern part of the state.</p>
        <p>''We contacted the supermarkets and they were very receptive in wanting to support local agriculture,'' said Mr. Chesmer, a managing partner of the label. ''We had to walk before we could run, but now we are at the point where we can really move forward.''</p>
        <p>Each day the milk from the six farms is picked up by tanker trucks and delivered to Guida Dairy in New Britain, which processes and packages the milk into cartons. They are then delivered to supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Dairy farmers in the state have struggled under a complicated federal pricing system that limits revenues even as production costs increase, Mr. Chesmer said. With their own label, the dairy partnership has more control over the price and can sell directly to supermarkets. A decade ago, there were 289 dairy farms in the state. That has dropped to about 170, with a handful closing since January, according to the State Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>The company would not release sales figures, but farmers in the partnership said sales of Farmer's Cow had grown 30 percent since its introduction.</p>
        <p>''I'm ecstatic in terms of the reception we've had in the marketplace,'' said Peter Orr, owner of Fort Hill Farms in Thompson, which is part of the partnership. The other farms are in Franklin, Coventry, Hebron and Woodstock.</p>
        <p>To increase sales, the partnership ran radio advertisements earlier this summer in Fairfield County and in the Hartford area. The farmers said they were also looking into offering more products, like chocolate milk and cream and other sizes of milk. The Farmer's Cow is sold only in half-gallon cartons for $2.89, Mr. Chesmer said.</p>
        <p>Representatives for two supermarket chains said they were interested in the milk because consumers in the state have responded well to home-grown items.</p>
        <p>''We do extensive research and people are looking for locally grown products,'' said Robert Keane, a spokesman for Stop &amp; Shop, which is based in Quincy, Mass., and has 83 stores in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Nick Maniatis, assistant manager for dairy for Shaw's Supermarkets, which is based in West Bridgewater, Mass., and has 25 stores in Connecticut, said that being hormone-free made the label even more attractive. ''Our consumers in general are a little more educated about some of these issues,'' he said. ''This milk is natural and it's local.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut dairy farmers are not the first in the Northeast to offer their own label. In 2004, a group in Rhode Island started Rhody Fresh, and in 1997, a group of seven western Massachusetts farmers formed a company to launch Our Family Farms milk.</p>
