        <p>DEEPLY embedded in my psyche I have the notion of an ''authentic'' American experience as being lived out in small towns where everything one might possibly need is within walking distance and the shopkeepers know everyone's name.</p>
        <p>This idyllic retail community, this myth, exists somewhere in New England, perhaps: look, under that spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands.

        <p>DEEPLY embedded in my psyche I have the notion of an ''authentic'' American experience as being lived out in small towns where everything one might possibly need is within walking distance and the shopkeepers know everyone's name.</p>
        <p>This idyllic retail community, this myth, exists somewhere in New England, perhaps: look, under that spreading chestnut tree, the village smithy stands. Or, maybe it's to be found in rural Minnesota, where all the women are strong and all the men good-looking and where the entire town gathers for breakfast every morning at the local diner or cafe.</p>
        <p>But, like many others in suburbia, I live, alas, within walking distance of nothing much. What I have instead, a convenient drive away, over the border in Connecticut, is that icon of American social isolation and commodity fetishism -- the mall.</p>
        <p>I am wary of a great deal that malls stand for: the sameness of products, the strong-arm tactics of big retailers, the creation through advertising of an insatiable appetite for more. But since this summer's heat wave has kept me from walking in my suburban neighborhood, I head for the mall to get some exercise, carrying with me all the baggage of my distrust of commercial culture.</p>
        <p>And what do I find there before the stores open, as the early morning light slants in through the glass skylights? I find, of course, small-town America -- or at least a fractured, commercialized, postmodern but still vital version of it.</p>
        <p>Most heartening to me are the older people, gregarious tables full of them, gathered every morning for a McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts version of the local diner. People who have known each other since childhood (or not, this being the 21st century) meeting for coffee and conversation. To be more accurate, they are getting together for the same reasons neighbors always have, lively small-town gossip and horrified analysis of a world that is going to hell in a handbasket.</p>
        <p>And then, on Friday evenings, the mall serves as a village square, where teenagers, garbed in ritual costumes, circle each other in ancient, esoteric coming-of-age patterns; the girls in twos or threes, the boys in tribes. There's even a genuine old-fashioned carousel in the food court, from the decades when the mall's location was the site of the annual state fair. The laughter of children sounds no different now than it did in the past.</p>
        <p>I wander around gazing in windows, spending little but time. Everywhere I look, I notice remnants of -- or, more precisely, allusions to -- the small-town past. Old Navy and the Gap offer a shopper the opportunity to dress for a back-to-the-future visit to the 1950's, and at Saturday Matinee you can buy the movies you would have seen in any rural backwater then. At Yankee Candle you can choose to illuminate your entire home or any part of it the old-fashioned way, and Pottery Barn will sell you the rugged farmhouse table upon which to set the candles.</p>
        <p>April Cornell, with its calicoes and laces, is gone, but everywhere this season the long white cambric petticoats and chemises of 19th-century undergarments abound, titillatingly styled now for outerwear. What prurient vision of the American past Victoria's Secret markets is best left unexamined.</p>
        <p>From the alienating modern youth culture of Urban Behavior, with its ragged denim, military canvas and ironic lace edging, you can turn for comfort to Build-a-Bear Workshop, ''where best friends are made.'' Thomas Kinkade, ''painter of light,'' will sell you mass-produced ''original'' images of enticing old-fashioned villages with covered bridges and rose-festooned stone walls. Nostalgia abounds. Nostalgia sells.</p>
        <p>But at the mall it is the mornings, before the stores open, that I enjoy, when the light streams through the glassed-in sky, when the mall belongs to the people rather than to big retail, when it is a small town, a community. When I can take a walk, or have my coffee or greet an acquaintance. Before the shopping frenzy begins.</p>
        <p>Nostalgia does indeed sell; nostalgia is a savvy marketing strategy. But, as the writer Sarah Orne Jewett wrote a century ago about small-town ''clannishness,'' community is still ''an instinct of the heart.''</p>
