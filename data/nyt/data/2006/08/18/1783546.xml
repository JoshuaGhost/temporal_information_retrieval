        <p>You could say that the Morgan Library and Museum is in a ''because we can'' mode. It has been celebrating Renzo Piano's brilliant expansion and reunification of its three-building home with exhibitions that few other institutions could muster. The latest, ''Celebrating Rembrandt: Etchings From the Morgan,'' presents 50 of this master's greatest etchings, culled from the library's extensive holdings of them, the largest and finest in North America.</p>
        <p>It is a thrilling if somewhat familiar show. Like Bach's suites for unaccompanied violoncello or Shakespeare's plays, Rembrandt's etchings represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort. They are sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and exalted and offer something new with each encounter.</p>

        <p>You could say that the Morgan Library and Museum is in a ''because we can'' mode. It has been celebrating Renzo Piano's brilliant expansion and reunification of its three-building home with exhibitions that few other institutions could muster. The latest, ''Celebrating Rembrandt: Etchings From the Morgan,'' presents 50 of this master's greatest etchings, culled from the library's extensive holdings of them, the largest and finest in North America.</p>
        <p>It is a thrilling if somewhat familiar show. Like Bach's suites for unaccompanied violoncello or Shakespeare's plays, Rembrandt's etchings represent genius of the plainest, most accessible sort. They are sustaining classics that encompass the earthy and exalted and offer something new with each encounter.</p>
        <p>This show coincides with the 400th anniversary of Rembrandt's birth, which has inspired exhibitions around the globe. According to the brochure, it also falls on the centenary of J. P. Morgan's 1906 purchase of George Vanderbilt's print collection, which added 112 Rembrandt etchings to the 156 Morgan had acquired from Theodore Irwin Sr. in 1900.</p>
        <p>Widely hailed as a triumph, Mr. Piano's design may ultimately qualify as a classic itself. It has been accompanied by an unnecessary expansion of the library's name to include ''museum'' and a quietly instituted change in the admission charge (from a suggested to a mandatory $12). But the library deserves credit for tearing down its fussy Beaux-Arts-style expansion of 1990, and opting for the stunning simplicity of Mr. Piano's conception. A box of glass and steel set on an expansive plane of oak, it centers the Morgan's three existing buildings on a setting that feels, for all its crisp urban geometry, as natural as a forest clearing.</p>
        <p>This structure's affirmation of light, space and solid ground is a bracing prelude to almost any kind of art, but especially to the brave new world of Rembrandt's etchings. As with Mr. Piano's cube, so with the prints: you look through them as much as at them.</p>
        <p>Rembrandt was arguably the first artist to shed lasting light on the human heart of darkness, and he did it most completely in his etchings. Like Shakespeare, he created a newly detailed portrait of the roiling subjectivity that is each person's private human condition. His etchings reveal life being lived, registering on individual faces and bodies, both in the instant and over the long run. It is often not a pretty sight. It is tragic, volatile, bittersweet, fragile, mundane, repulsive and, in the honesty and complexity of these portrayals, extraordinarily beautiful.</p>
        <p>This focus on the moment required a different technical approach and a more open-ended improvisational style, which might have made Rembrandt-as-etcher something like the first Process Artist. This also makes his etchings more pictorially exciting and innovative than his paintings, and helps them avoid the spotlighted melodrama and surface murkiness that can afflict his oils.</p>
        <p>Notably telling in this regard is the great variety of surviving print states: those progress-report impressions made at different stages so that the artist can see how a print is developing. Those on view here suggest that Rembrandt relished leaving a record of his artistic process and that he perhaps considered the states to be almost independent artworks. (In addition to examples of 309 of the 375 prints that Rembrandt is known to have made, the Morgan has nearly 200 additional states, some of which are unique impressions because of Rembrandt's improvisatory working methods.)</p>
        <p>The etchings here, selected and installed by Anne Varick Lauder, a curatorial fellow in the department of drawings and prints, encapsulate the man and his career. They run the gamut of Rembrandt's subjects: high and low, sex and death, landscape and portraiture.</p>
        <p>There are portraits of family and friends, burghers and beggars, female nudes in mythological and natural guises, and deftly accurate accounts of the vistas and farm buildings found on the outskirts of mid-17th-century Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Religious subjects are especially plentiful, rendered on a scale from modest to magnificent. A 1645 image of Jacob caressing his son Benjamin extends far beyond Christianity in its portrayal of fatherly tenderness. The monumental ''Christ Crucified Between Two Thieves'' (1653-55) presents the climax of the biblical narrative as an event of almost cataclysmic foreboding, whose darkness increases markedly from the first to the fourth of its five states. (Superb examples of those two proofs are on view.)</p>
        <p>The show's nine self-portraits begin with Rembrandt's beginnings, as a cocky and exorbitantly talented youth of 21, exploring the expressiveness of the human face in five sometimes hammy but completely beguiling images, done from 1627 to 1630. The next year, he moved from Leiden to Amsterdam and made his first serious self-portrait, wearing finery worthy of a wealthy merchant and leaning suavely on a stone sill, like a Renaissance courtier.</p>
        <p>His penchant for role-playing is also visible in his only self-portrait with his beloved wife, Saskia (from 1636): his hat is 16th century, while her veil seems to cast her further back in time. Finally, in a self-portrait from 1648, six years after Saskia's death, we see Rembrandt in dark clothes, diligently etching by a window, looking at us as toward a mirror and quietly, somewhat wearily, appraising a face that is sadder, wiser and wider.</p>
        <p>Unlike the paintings, which tend to focus on noble people and events, Rembrandt's etchings explore the full range of human types and experience. Next to the two states of ''Christ Crucified Between Two Thieves'' hang two intimately scaled, lightly worked images. ''Beggars Receiving Alms'' portrays a family in patched clothing begging door to door. The insouciantly reportorial ''Monk in the Cornfield'' captures its subject from the back, in flagrante delicto with a woman whose presence is established mostly by the sturdy legs wrapped around his torso.</p>
        <p>Rembrandt's etchings command our attention through the immediacy and astounding variety of their line; their joyful, expressive ease; and the continual adjustment of scale and intensity to their subjects. We sense the shifting moods of the artist holding the etching needle, smiling at his rendering of the monk, pulled off in a quickly wrought single state; then bearing down on the Crucifixion plate to a point where it must have seemed almost ruined, but then pushing on, to emphasize ruination itself as part of the work's content. Its clarity survives.</p>
        <p>Even at their darkest, Rembrandt's etchings, like Renzo Piano's great glass cube, celebrate the ideal of transparency.</p>
        <p>''Celebrating Rembrandt: Etchings From the Morgan'' runs through Oct. 1 at the Morgan Library and Museum, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street; (212) 685-0008.</p>
