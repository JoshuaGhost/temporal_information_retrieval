        <p>After a three-year freeze in its property tax, Nassau County faces a structural deficit exceeding $100 million next year, the county comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, warned yesterday. Nassau must make tough budget choices to avoid raising taxes, he said. But the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, vowed ''a no-tax-increase budget'' for 2007. His budget, due next month, has additional political implications, because he is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, challenging Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Suozzi claims that he is better qualified to solve the state's problems because of his success in balancing Nassau's books. The County Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, said that while she hoped the tax freeze would continue, ''a small increase might be necessary.''</p>
