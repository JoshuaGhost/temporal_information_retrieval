        <p>As a Puerto Rican resident of Peter Cooper Village, I read ''Battle in Black and White'' with immense interest. It was a testimonial of how far we have come and how far we still need to go. In 1952 MetLife followed a policy of segregation that was institutionalized nationwide.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a Puerto Rican resident of Peter Cooper Village, I read ''Battle in Black and White'' with immense interest. It was a testimonial of how far we have come and how far we still need to go. In 1952 MetLife followed a policy of segregation that was institutionalized nationwide.</p>
        <p>The apartments are now open to all. Some of the longtime residents are resentful of newcomers, especially of minority background, and are acting in a manner that would be better fitted to the 50's. During the 2004 presidential elections, I was questioned by a longtime resident as to my eligibility to vote, while my companion, who is white and had the same documentation, was not harassed.</p>
        <p>When coming into the building, with key in hand, I have been stopped by longtime residents and asked if I live in the building. Some have stopped me and asked if I work in the building, and look surprised when I inform them that I live there. It's time for the longtime residents to treat their new neighbors, minority or otherwise, with respect, kindness and dignity.</p>
