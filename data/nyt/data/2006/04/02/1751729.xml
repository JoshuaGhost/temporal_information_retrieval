        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The New York City Department of Environmental Protection's plan to divert sewage from affluent, predominantly white Yorktown to blue-collar, largely minority Peekskill has finally been stalled (''Going With the Flow,'' editorial, March 19). Instead, the Yorktown sewage treatment plant will be upgraded to the required high levels, and its clean effluent used to replenish local streams and wetlands.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Town of Yorktown is requesting a 67 percent increase over its present plant capacity, which could lead to sprawl. Fortunately, sprawl can be kept under control if plant capacity increases were granted under only the most stringent prerequisites -- for example, the elimination of all illegal hookups to the sewer lines.</p>
        <p>Diversion is more likely than upgrades to be the catalyst for sprawl. The 1997 watershed agreement specifically allows 10 percent by volume of the sewage discharge diverted out of the watershed to be reinstated from new development anywhere in the watershed. And if diversion pipes were installed, designed for over-capacity according to standard engineering practice, there would be no way to prevent developers from hooking up, leading to more sprawl.</p>
        <p>Upgrading Yorktown's sewage treatment plant will do more than diversion to stem the tide of irresponsible development, protect our water quality and prevent minority communities from being unfairly affected.</p>
