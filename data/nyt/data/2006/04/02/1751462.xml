        <p>THE name of the bakery on Blackwell Street here in Dover is no lie. ''Ohh Qué Rico!'' is Spanish for ''Ohh How Delicious!'' and the bakery's Colombian cheese roll, known as pandebono, is indeed rico.</p>
        <p>It is especially rico hot out of the oven, accompanied by the pale green juice from the fruit known as lulo. So it seemed odd that on a recent Sunday morning, the bakery was practically deserted.</p>

        <p>THE name of the bakery on Blackwell Street here in Dover is no lie. ''Ohh Qué Rico!'' is Spanish for ''Ohh How Delicious!'' and the bakery's Colombian cheese roll, known as pandebono, is indeed rico.</p>
        <p>It is especially rico hot out of the oven, accompanied by the pale green juice from the fruit known as lulo. So it seemed odd that on a recent Sunday morning, the bakery was practically deserted.</p>
        <p>But as the pandebonos cooled without a taker and the lulo juice sat untouched behind the counter, Dover's Colombian-Americans were gathering elsewhere for sustenance of another kind: the Catholic Mass at Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>By 11 a.m., the small brick church on Myrtle Avenue was filled with worshipers, mostly Colombians, who packed every pew and every square foot of floor space so tightly that not another soul could squeeze in the front door. Latecomers had to go in a side door and down to the basement, where another crowd watched what was going on upstairs on poor-quality closed-circuit television.</p>
        <p>It is hard to know exactly how many Colombians live in Dover, a Morris County town with a population of 18,000, a majority of them Latino. The 2000 census puts the number at 2,050, ranking Colombians behind only the older and more dispersed Puerto Rican population among the municipality's largest Latino groups. But that is almost certainly an undercount.</p>
        <p>In any case, a walk along Blackwell Street, with its Colombian restaurants and bakeries, Colombian products in the markets and a local performance hall that often plays host to the biggest names in Colombian music, makes it clear that Colombians rule -- though not literally, anymore. The city's first Colombian-American mayor, Javier Marín, a Republican, left office in January. The current mayor, James Dodd, was born in Dover.</p>
        <p>Dover's center grew increasingly Colombian beginning in the late 1980's, said Beatriz Villada, vice president (and former president) of Club Colombia, the main civic organization for Colombian-Americans in the area. For decades before that, Dover was the northern outpost of the Puerto Rican town of Aguada, which sent a stream of migrants in search of work in local industry.</p>
        <p>Angel Mendoza, the owner of Furniture House, one of the biggest shops on Blackwell Street, said that when he arrived in Dover from Aguada four decades ago, the street was bustling with mainstream stores like J. C. Penney.</p>
        <p>But when the nearby Rockaway Townsquare mall opened in the 1970's, businesses either moved there or shut down. ''Blackwell was left totally empty,'' said Mr. Mendoza, who, like the other residents quoted in this article, spoke in Spanish. ''Little by little, the Puerto Ricans started moving to Florida and Puerto Rico, and Colombians and Mexicans started to arrive.''</p>
        <p>Not that Puerto Ricans have disappeared. Although they no longer run the center of town, they certainly dominate the Dover Lanes bowling alley on Sunday afternoons. There, the Spanish-American league is largely made up of locally raised Puerto Ricans who switched to bowling when their bodies convinced them that continuing their weekly game of (American) football would be orthopedic folly.</p>
        <p>There is little resentment of the newcomers, at least among this crowd. ''The main thing I remember was that downtown was vacant,'' said Robert Soto, 39, who runs the league and was growing up when the mall opened. ''They're the ones, the Colombians and the Mexicans, that started up all the businesses. They're responsible for the revitalization of downtown.''</p>
        <p>Along Blackwell Street, there is little question of that. Ecuadoreans, Chileans and Uruguayans all have a presence, there are several Mexican shops, and there are apparently enough Costa Ricans in town that the Unique Bar hung a banner noting that it was now serving their native Imperial beer.</p>
        <p>But most places are Colombian, like Ohh Qué Rico, and restaurants like Tierras Colombianas, which specializes in the fish known as bocachico. And on this particular Sunday, shortly before the recent Colombian election, candidates for Colombia's House of Representatives (which has a seat reserved to represent expatriates) smiled from campaign posters along the street. In spring and summer, hot dogs served at the weekly flea market are Colombian-style, with toppings like pineapple or crushed potato chips (preferably both).</p>
        <p>Though Colombian food is not well known outside the community, Carlos Amezquita, the owner of Tierras Colombianas, said that almost every day a few non-Latinos wander in to eat. On this Sunday, Paul and Dorottya Olchvary, a couple of Hungarian-Americans, to be precise, were having the $7 lunch special of short ribs and a hearty soup and struggling to get the waitresses (who speak little English) to believe they really didn't want sugar in their coffee.</p>
        <p>But they were the exceptions. Nearby, a Colombian immigrant, Manuel Guillermo Mesa, was taking his two teenage daughters, Andrea Estefania and Monica, out for Colombian skirt steaks. They live with their mother in Parsippany, and when Mr. Mesa, who lives in Dover, gets together with them, he likes to take them to Colombian places.</p>
        <p>''It's just not the same to go to an American restaurant as it is to a Colombian restaurant,'' he said. ''Among us Colombians, we understand one another and the way we treat one another.''</p>
        <p>That includes flirting, it became clear, when the charming pink-uniformed Colombian waitress stopped by the table a few moments later.</p>
        <p>''Do you need anything else?'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Just your presence,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>In the back, the flirting was for higher stakes. Luis Moreno, 17, and Ingrid Mora, 15, had just come back from their speed-skating team's workout. They sat face to face, he with a Colombian apple soda and she with a Snapple juice drink, chewing gum despite a mouth full of braces. Mr. Moreno, who has been in the United States only for a couple of years, was pleading with Ms. Mora to be his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>He explained his strategy a few minutes later. ''I was telling her that I liked her, that I couldn't live without her,'' he said. She was unconvinced -- at least for the time being.</p>
        <p>It must have been especially challenging for Mr. Moreno to declare his love considering that Ingrid's mother, Constanza Tobar, a waitress in the restaurant, sat just out of earshot, having lunch after the midday rush.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tobar was not concerned about her daughter. ''I'm always keeping an eye on her,'' she said. ''She tells me almost everything, I think.'' With that she went back to her ribs and lulo juice.</p>
