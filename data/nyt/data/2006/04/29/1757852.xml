        <p>Competition for Las Vegas Strip Property Heats Up With Two New Bids for Aztar  Two companies raised their offers yesterday for the Aztar Corporation, owner of the Tropicana casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, with the hotel and casino operator Columbia Sussex Corporation topping the bidding with an offer of about $1.93 billion. Aztar, which is based in Phoenix, is prized for its 34 acres of Las Vegas Strip land that are considered ripe for redevelopment. The Tropicana Casino is currently on the property. Competition to acquire Aztar heated up earlier yesterday when the casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment, based in Las Vegas, raised its bid by about 7 percent, to $1.85 billion. The $50-a-share offer from Columbia Sussex, a closely held hotel and casino owner, ''is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal,'' Aztar said yesterday. Ameristar Casinos, based in Las Vegas, and Colony Capital, of Los Angeles, have also been bidding for Aztar. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>Goldman Alliance Buys Stake in Large Chinese Bank  China's biggest government-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, said today that it had sold an 8.89 percent stake to an alliance led by Goldman Sachs in a deal worth $3.8 billion. The bank said the alliance, which includes American Express and Allianz, had bought 24.2 billion new shares. The Chinese bank is planning a $12 billion initial public offering of stock this year. The deal, which was completed today, was initially announced in January. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>Chevron Reports 49% Increase in First-Quarter Profit  The Chevron Corporation said yesterday that first-quarter profit surged 49 percent, to $4 billion, topping Wall Street expectations. Chevron's profit was $1.80 a share, up from $2.68 billion, or $1.28 a share, in the period a year ago. Analysts had expected $1.78 a share. Revenue increased 31 percent, to $54.62 billion. Profits rose sharply in exploration and production, while refining and marketing turned in a strong performance on higher margins. Earnings at chemical operations grew 12 percent, also on better margins. Lower oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico after last year's hurricanes reduced the bottom line by $300 million in the quarter. And the company warned that government measures in Venezuela could hurt its production volumes there. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>Avon's Profit Falls 67% on Turnaround Costs  Avon Products said yesterday that its first-quarter profit fell 67 percent, mostly as a result of charges from a restructuring program aimed at reviving flagging sales. The company also said it was making faster-than-expected progress in its turnaround plan, and was stepping up efforts to expand direct selling in China. In March, Avon received China's first direct-selling business license since the practice was banned in 1998. ''We've begun to significantly step our investment up to aggressively support the national rollout of direct-selling opportunity,'' the chief executive, Andrea Jung, above, said in a conference call. For the quarter ended March 31, Avon reported net income of $56.2 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with $172 million, or 36 cents a share in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 6 percent, to $2 billion from $1.88 billion. (AP)</p>
        <p>Volkswagen's Profit Falls Short of Forecasts  Volkswagen said yesterday that its net profit more than quadrupled in the first quarter on sharply higher sales, but the results fell short of analysts' expectations and the company's shares fell 5 percent. Profit rose to 327 million euros ($409 million) from 70 million euros a year earlier, with revenue up 21 percent at 25.3 billion euros ($31.7 billion) from 20.9 billion euros. The earnings were below the 439 million euros ($549 million) expected by analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires, and Volkswagen's stock fell to 61.49 euros ($77.38) a share. The company cut its losses in the North American market, where the strength of the euro made its products less competitive on price. The operating loss was 233 million euros ($291 million), down from a loss of 332 million euros a year earlier. (AP)</p>
        <p>Vonage to Expand Stock Offer as Subscribers Grow  Vonage Holdings, the country's largest Internet telephone service, more than doubled the amount it expects to raise in its initial public offering and reported record subscriber growth. Vonage, which said in February it expected to sell shares worth $250 million, said in a regulatory filing yesterday that it planned to sell 31.25 million shares at $16 to $18 each, putting the total value of the offering at around $530 million. The company, based in Holmdel, N.J., said it had more than 1.6 million subscribers on April 1. That indicated an addition of 328,000 customers in the first quarter, the company's strongest ever. Vonage's early lead in Internet phone service had been narrowing as cable companies have started marketing the service to their own subscribers. (AP)</p>
        <p>British Yellow Pages Publisher Makes Acquisition  Yell Group, a publisher of Yellow Pages directories in Britain and the United States, agreed to buy Telefónica Publicidad e Información for 3.07 billion euros ($3.85 billion) to expand in Europe and Latin America. The company bid 8.50 euros a share for the Telefónica Publicidad, a unit of Telefónica of Madrid. The bid is a 4.9 percent discount to the closing price on Thursday. Telefónica Publicidad's owners will also get a 40 cent dividend to be paid May 5, Yell said yesterday. Shares in Telefónica Publicidad fell 2 percent and shares in Yell, of Reading, England, fell 2.9 percent. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
