        <p>Terry Deitz, an airline pilot, has been unbeatable on this season's ''Survivor'' on CBS, having succeeded in all four individual immunity challenges (competitions that prevent the winner from being voted off during that episode). The streak was a necessity for Mr. Deitz; otherwise, he would surely have been voted off by now. Thursday's episode perked up in the ratings compared with its record in recent weeks, bringing in 17.1 million viewers in the Nielsen estimates. After ''Survivor'' won the 8 p.m. hour, CBS's ''CSI'' (26.9 million) had a ''Rashomon''-like structure, with each detective reconstructing a crime scene that had been robbed of evidence. ''CSI'' crushed its competition in the 9 p.m. hour, most notably ABC's ''American Inventor'' (7.3 million) and NBC's ''My Name Is Earl'' (8.9 million) and ''The Office'' (7.7 million). The ratings of those two NBC comedies among viewers 18 to 49 have gradually declined since they moved to Thursdays in January. At 10 p.m., ''Without a Trace'' (17.9 million) gave CBS another hourly win, and handed the network a big victory on the first night of the May sweeps period.</p>
