        <p>ASKINAS--Milton. On April 6, 2006, at age 91. He was first and foremost a family man who is survived by his devoted wife, Wilma; his daughter, Barbara Sheib; his son, Ira; his grandchildren, Debra and Robert Feldman; and, his friend and caretaker, Thomas Garcia. It is not easy to capture the essence of someone like Milton Askinas. He was blessed with such high standards of excellence in every field of endeavor and was a giant in his field. Glen Oaks and Slacks was founded by his father in 1903 and Milton was with the firm for 75 years. ''This we will remember, When the rest of life is through, The finest we've ever done, Is simply loving you.'' Services Sunday, April 9, at 1PM, at ''RiversideNassau North Chapels,'' 55 North Station Plaza (opp LIRR), Great Neck, N.Y.</p>
