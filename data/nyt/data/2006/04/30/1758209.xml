        <p>The Perils of Posting</p>
        <p>Q. What determines whether boards around a construction site carry warnings to ''Post No Bills''? And who, if anyone, enforces such restrictions? I'm always surprised that posters seem to heed the warnings.</p>
        <p>A. ''Post No Bills'' is a lot like ''No Trespassing,'' explained Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division of the city's Law Department.</p>

        <p>The Perils of Posting</p>
        <p>Q. What determines whether boards around a construction site carry warnings to ''Post No Bills''? And who, if anyone, enforces such restrictions? I'm always surprised that posters seem to heed the warnings.</p>
        <p>A. ''Post No Bills'' is a lot like ''No Trespassing,'' explained Gabriel Taussig, chief of the administrative law division of the city's Law Department.</p>
        <p>''The 'Post No Bills' inscriptions observed at various private construction sites are not placed there by the city, nor are they required by the city,'' Mr. Taussig wrote in an e-mail message. ''They are probably placed there by the property owners or their agents.''</p>
        <p>If someone ignored a sign and posted advertisements, the property owner might argue that placing the ads was a form of trespassing, Mr. Taussig wrote.</p>
        <p>It's possible that defying such a sign would violate a city restriction in some cases. ''However, the city enforces those restrictions by issuing violations, not by placing warnings on private property,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>That Island Off New Jersey</p>
        <p>Q. Why isn't Staten Island part of New Jersey? It's closer to New Jersey than it is to any other part of New York.</p>
        <p>A. Many things in life are illogical, unfair or both. This is surely one.</p>
        <p>In 1630, Peter Minuit, commander of the New Netherland settlement, on behalf of the Dutch West India Company, bought Staten Island from the Tappan Indians for axes, hoes, kettles, awls and wampum, according to ''The Island at the Center of the World,'' by Russell Shorto. Staten Eylandt, as the leaders of New Amsterdam spelled it, was named in honor of the States General, the governing body of the United Provinces of the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>When the Dutch yielded New Netherland to the English in 1664, Staten Island became part of the New York province, according to The Encyclopedia of New York City. Back then, there were more people in that province than in the Dutch settlements in New Jersey near Staten Island. The island remained with New York despite claims by East Jersey. In 1670, the provincial governor settled with the remaining Indians on a final purchase deal.</p>
        <p>When the colony was divided into 10 counties in 1683, Staten Island became the County of Richmond, named for James, the Duke of Richmond (in Yorkshire), who was the brother of Charles II.</p>
        <p>A Club No More</p>
        <p>Q. During the 1970's, I worked at the City Athletic Club, which occupied a beautiful town house at 50 West 54th Street. When I passed by recently, I was shocked to see that the building had been demolished. Wasn't it a designated landmark?</p>
        <p>A. No; the Landmarks Preservation Commission had considered the 1907 building, but it declined to take action.</p>
        <p>The City Athletic Club was founded by Jews who had been excluded from established city clubs. After membership declined, the club disbanded and sold the building in 2002 to the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>The lot has recently been surrounded by a construction wall next to the museum, which has said it wants the property for possible future growth. It is reviewing options for the site. Meanwhile, overflow lines sometimes use the lot in a crowd-control measure.</p>
