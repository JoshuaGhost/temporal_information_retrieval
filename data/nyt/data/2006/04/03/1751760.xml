        <p>It's not semi-nudes or celebrity satire or kittens' antics that dominate the most-viewed list at YouTube.com, the popular clearinghouse for international homemade video.

        <p>Skinny guys with moppy hair in modest houses have officially staked their claim to the latest medium for short, loud adolescent messages: YouTube.</p>
        <p>It's not semi-nudes or celebrity satire or kittens' antics that dominate the most-viewed list at YouTube.com, the popular clearinghouse for international homemade video. So exactly what videos are drawing viewers to this ascendant site, which, less than a year after its launch, averages around 25 million hits each day?</p>
        <p>YouTube makes this question easy to answer by giving users several ways to sort the videos, including by ''most discussed,'' ''most recent'' and, handily, ''most viewed.'' It turns out that most of the videos that get millions of looks are humorous posturings by kids who in other places and at other times might be collecting near-mint X-Men comics, or practicing Metallica licks.</p>
        <p>Take the most-viewed YouTube video of all time. Though it has been up for only four months, the ''Pokémon Theme Music Video'' has accumulated 6.8 million views, according to the site's counter. (You can go to www.youtube.com and search for all of these.) The video, a lip-sync duet by Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox of smosh.com, is a fine example of YouTube's charming two-housebound-handsome-guys genre. Judging from the effusive if subliterate comments section, it's not disliked by anyone, which is rare. The comments section can be harsh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hecox are viral video's Matt and Ben, but they short-sell their good looks by capering around to -- in this case -- the theme to the Pokémon game that so many American teenagers grew up playing. The song underscores both the insidious pleasure and mental isolation of the popular game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hecox, who post somewhat more sophisticated videos on smosh.com, make the most of the lyrics, fiercely hitting their marks without cracking up as they bound around what looks like a messy suburban bedroom. It's a testament to the unimpeachable humor of this video that even its blasphemy -- at one point, Mr. Hecox sucks on a Jesus figurine -- hasn't provoked a credible backlash in comments.</p>
        <p>''This is an awesome video,'' a typical comment reads. ''The only negative criticism I have is DON'T EAT JESUS!!!'' Another ventured, tamely: ''aw por Jesus.''</p>
        <p>David Lehre, whose video ''Myspace: THE MOVIE!'' has just slipped from second to third most views of all time, with 4.9 million, gives Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hecox a run for their money. Just as the smosh guys did with Pokémon, Mr. Lehre attracts a huge viewership by exploiting an obvious sideline obsession of YouTube fiends: MySpace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehre sends up various conventions of the overexposed online Place for Friends. In the first section, a kid is photographing himself from odd angles for his profile. Right when he's trying to get a sexy shot of himself in undershorts, his mother walks in. Later, in the second section, we learn that MySpace participants who show ''the angles'' -- photographs of various body parts rather than a full-body pose -- are concealing ugliness. Or so goes the Generation M rule of thumb. The joke drags after that, but it has made its point.</p>
        <p>At No. 2 is a meticulous, live-action staging of the intro to ''The Simpsons.'' It has attracted around five million views. At first, ''The Real Simpsons'' looks like a brilliant D.I.Y. project, but actually it's a full-dress trailer for the new ''Simpsons'' season by Britain's Sky One channel. If you didn't catch it at the beginning of the ''Simpsons'' episode shown on Fox on March 26, here's your chance to see a human Bart skateboarding over Homer's car, or a real Maggie being passed through a supermarket checker. Beware, though: there's something unsettlingly British about it. Did they get every frame but miss the Simpsons' American spirit?</p>
        <p>After that, the most-viewed videos include some professional work, including lackluster music videos and evocative commercials for Nike (''Ronaldinho: Touch of Gold'') and Sony Bravia. Advertisers take note: apart from movie trailers, the commercials that are currently the most successfully viral -- passed around by e-mail -- are tender and recessive, like ballads. Fans seem to like their brasher stuff homemade.</p>
        <p>Videos with Asian and Asian-American themes get heavy play. Anime clips and trailers, weird work like ''Korean Madness,'' and the much-emulated comic stylings of ''two chinese boys,'' who have multiple entries on the site, are the bread and butter of YouTube. One Chinese-American contributor seems to have discovered a reservoir of humor that he and others might draw on for years to come. This is ''Crazy Asian Mother,'' which has the subtitle, ''how asian parents really act when childrens get B+.'' The spelling error seems to be deliberate. The sketch is amateurish, but it comes together. The comments are almost all amens: ''It's soooo true,'' ''reminds me of my own mother,'' and so on.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful video, by far, is called simply ''guitar,'' and it has drawn, according to YouTube, nearly two million views. (It's also the No. 2 most-discussed video on the site.) Like the Nike commercial, and the mesmerizing, disturbing ''Knife Skills,'' in which a sullen young woman wields a butterfly knife at high speed, ''guitar'' is a display of unalloyed physical virtuosity that preempts criticism. After a black screen, the opening bars of Pachelbel's Canon begin, and title cards identify the piece, adding, ''Arranged by JerryC,'' and ''Played by funtwo.'' Funtwo, presumably, then shows up: he's a young-looking guy in a T-shirt and a baseball cap that obscures his face. He's sitting by a computer and holding an electric guitar. He looks like any introverted kid with frontman fantasies.</p>
        <p>Still, the anonymous image is arresting. Bright light shines through a window behind him, surrounding him with a glow; the effect is dreamlike. Funtwo then plays JerryC's rock embellishment over the classical piece with amazing dexterity, managing to enliven the music and create a lasting work of pop art. As the comments say: ''dude teach me how to play,'' ''it is undeniably one of the best solos ive ever see,'' ''u could go up against jimi hendrix.'' What's most impressive about the performance is the combination of funtwo's shyness and his aggressive, guitar-god fingerwork.</p>
        <p>Some posters try to suggest that the performance is fake; but someone called fablesoftherest seems to silence most of the skeptics: ''I'll end the guesswork-the kid is for real,'' adding, ''Funtwo's is the definitive version. This kid is destined to be one of the great guitarists of all time.''</p>
        <p>Finally, an extremely funny video that deserves more views on YouTube is ''Leprechaun in Mobile,'' a local Alabama news segment that seems too hilarious to be real. (Is it a hoax? Does it matter?) Yes, the video is nothing more than its title says, a Leprechaun in Mobile. But if you're into short video, that's more than enough.</p>
