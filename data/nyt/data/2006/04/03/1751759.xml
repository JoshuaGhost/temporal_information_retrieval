        <p>9 P.M. (Travel) JEREMY PIVEN'S JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME -- Not that weever get actors confused with their roles, but who would have thought that Ari, the heart-of-stone agent on HBO's ''Entourage,'' had a spiritual side? Jeremy Piven (left), who plays Ari, goes to India and attends a traditional Kathakali theater performance. Next week he visits the holy town of Rishikesh, mecca for yoga devotees.</p>
        <p>6 P.M. (MTV) YO MOMMA. -- Series premiere. Wilmer Valderrama, the sexy-nerdy exchange student Fez on ''That 70's Show,'' is</p>
        <p>host of this reality competition series. ''Real kids from the streets,'' he says, will try to outdo one another talking smack, talking</p>
        <p>trash, snapping or whatever it's called. As in ''Yo momma is so fat that . . . ''</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) THE JUILLIARD SCHOOL: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS -- Renée Fleming, Emanuel Ax, Leontyne Price, Itzhak Perlman and Wynton Marsalis are among the performers in this ''Live From Lincoln Center'' concert. Juilliard opened in 1905 as the Institute of Musical Art.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (5) PRISON BREAK -- It's flashback time. Viewers learn how several characters ended up behind bars.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) TWO AND A HALF MEN -- Martin Sheen guest-stars in this 2005 episode of his son Charlie Sheen's hit sitcom. The elder Mr. Sheen (right, with his son) plays the father of Charlie's sweet-natured stalker, Rose (Melanie Lynskey).</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (IFC) AMÉLIE -- (2001). Audrey Tautou stars as the most cheerful waitress in Paris. She loves to arrange her friends' lives but may finally find a love of her own.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (5) 24 -- ''Day 5: 10 P.M.-11 P.M.'' Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) decides it's time to deal with Christopher Henderson (Peter Weller, the original Robocop), the former counterterrorist agent with terrorist connections.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) FATAL DESIRE -- (2006). Her screen name is Sexykitten4onlyu; his is Jerseydude. Anne Heche and Eric Roberts (left) -- an inspired pairing -- star in a television psychothriller about an Internet affair. They play two consenting</p>
        <p>adults who connect online, meet in Atlantic City and begin a torrid affair. One of them turns out to be crazy.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) THE APPRENTICE -- In the latest round of Donald Trump's reality-competition series, teams are called upon to</p>
