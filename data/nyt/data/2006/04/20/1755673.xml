        <p>In a world filled with complicated MP3 players and online audio stores, it's a wonder that anyone gets any listening done at all. Playaway hopes to change all that by making an audio book purchase as easy as plopping down a credit card at the airport gift shop.</p>
        <p>Playaway's MP3 players, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, each contain one unabridged audio book. Titles include ''The Da Vinci Code'' and ''Anansi Boys,'' with more on the way. The devices come with headphones and a triple-A battery. When you're ready to listen, simply pull a protective tab to get the battery going.</p>

        <p>In a world filled with complicated MP3 players and online audio stores, it's a wonder that anyone gets any listening done at all. Playaway hopes to change all that by making an audio book purchase as easy as plopping down a credit card at the airport gift shop.</p>
        <p>Playaway's MP3 players, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, each contain one unabridged audio book. Titles include ''The Da Vinci Code'' and ''Anansi Boys,'' with more on the way. The devices come with headphones and a triple-A battery. When you're ready to listen, simply pull a protective tab to get the battery going.</p>
        <p>The Playaway cannot be loaded with a different book, but you can add it your library and listen to it again and again.</p>
        <p>A small screen shows the elapsed time, and the device has buttons for fast-forwarding, rewinding, adding bookmarks and skipping chapters. There's even a Voice Speed button, which compresses the audio slightly, reducing the total playing time without sacrificing audio quality. The devices are available at bookshops, retail stores and online for $35 to $50.</p>
        <p>Owners of iPods may smirk at a one-book-only device, but Playaway may be the simplest and quickest way to get from the store to Chapter 1.</p>
