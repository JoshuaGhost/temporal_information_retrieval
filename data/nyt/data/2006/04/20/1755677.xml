        <p>Phillips will introduce phones using new Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard to improve call quality and security; phones work on 1.9 gigahertz frequency to avoid interference with other wireless devices; DECT 221 model will cost $110; DECT 225 model will cost $130 with built-in answerering system; DECT 220 add-on model will cost $100; photos (M)</p>

        <p>When it comes to standard telephone service, nothing exceeds the quality of corded handsets. Unlike popular wireless models, corded phones, which cost as little as $20, are free of the crackles and whooshes endemic to cordless models as their users move around the house.</p>
        <p>But a new cordless technology promises to change all that. Next month, Philips will introduce its first phones in the United States, and they will use a new standard, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), to improve call quality and security.</p>

        <p>But a new cordless technology promises to change all that. Next month, Philips will introduce its first phones in the United States, and they will use a new standard, Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT), to improve call quality and security.</p>
        <p>DECT operates at 1.9 gigahertz, outside the 2.4-gigahertz frequency used for many wireless devices, making it immune to interference from modems and other wireless phones. The new models -- the DECT 221 ($110) and the DECT 225 ($130, with a built-in answering system) -- offer double the battery life of standard wireless phones. The DECT 220, an add-on phone that connects wirelessly to the base station, is $100. DECT technology also lets compatible phones from other manufacturers connect to the main Philips units.</p>
