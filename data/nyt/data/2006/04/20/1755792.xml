        <p>A court convicted a senior lawyer for Yukos, the nearly dismantled oil company, and sentenced her to seven years in prison in a case that has been widely criticized as an example of prosecutorial abuses, news agencies reported. The lawyer, Svetlana Bakhmina, was charged with embezzlement and tax evasion in what her lawyers said was an effort to exert pressure on higher-ranking company executives who fled into exile, including her immediate superior. Advocacy groups abroad criticized the case as an assault on lawyers' privileges. Her case drew added attention after her arrest in December 2004 because of accusations that she was mistreated in detention and refused permission to speak with her young children.</p>
