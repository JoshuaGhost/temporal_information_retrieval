        <p>MICHAEL POLLAN'S new book, ''The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,'' describes a nation that is the victim of ''a plague of corn.'' The No. 1 legal crop is ''the perfect capitalist plant,'' he said on ''Fresh Air'' on NPR this week.</p>
        <p>About a third of Mr. Pollan's book is taken up with corn. It is the ''keystone species'' of the ''industrial food chain'' that feeds most of us, he said in an interview with Techdirt.com.</p>
        <p>America, Mr. Pollan says, has ''a national eating disorder.'' To describe it, the book traces the creation of four meals: one ''industrial,'' two ''organic,'' and one procured by the author himself as a ''hunter-gatherer.''</p>
        <p>There are problems with each, but the industrial meal, not surprisingly, is the most troublesome. He traces it from an Iowa cornfield to its final form -- fast food scarfed down in a moving car.</p>
        <p>All along that journey, corn wreaks havoc. The overuse of nitrogen fertilizers leads to occasional ''blue baby'' alerts in Des Moines warning parents that nitrate-loaded tap water could render their babies' brains unable to receive oxygen. Those same fertilizers flow down the Mississippi into the Gulf of Mexico, where they seasonally create a ''dead zone'' the size of New Jersey that is dangerous to sea life.</p>
        <p>By virtue of its being ''paved over'' with corn, Iowa is, in its way, the most developed state in the country, he told NPR. On the market, corn is cheap, Mr. Pollan points out. But the costs -- to the environment, to the economy, and to the health care system -- are enormous.</p>
        <p>''We eat so much corn that, biologically speaking, most Americans are corn on two legs,'' Bonnie Azab Powell, a journalist, wrote on NewsCenter site of the University of California, Berkeley (berkeley.edu/news).</p>
        <p>Image Is Everything -- Adidas is selling a line of shoes bearing an image designed by an artist who has repeatedly used the same image -- a stereotypical depiction of an Asian youth -- in anti-racist contexts. That didn't stop bloggers and chat room denizens from calling it racist.</p>
        <p>The controversy grew from there. Even after they learned of the history of both the image and the artist, Barry McGee, some critics continued to insist that the drawing, which shows ''an Asian youth with bowl-cut hair, pig nose and buck teeth,'' as described by the BBC, was offensive. ''Slapping a Chinese face on a sneaker removes it from that context,'' Aimee Baldillo of the Asian American Justice Center, told the BBC.</p>
        <p>The criticisms amount to ''Internet garbage,'' said Keith Hufnagel, owner of Huf, the United States clothing designer that produced the shoe for Adidas. Still, message boards on sites like Shanghaiist.com, contain negative reactions from people who say that while they're sure Adidas meant no harm, they're still insulted.</p>
        <p>Click Fraud -- Benjamin Cohen, often described as Britain's ''first teenaged dot-com billionaire,'' writes in his Times Online (timesonline.co.uk) column about how Google accused his company of click fraud -- where either publishers or the competitors of online advertisers repeatedly click on ads to cost those advertisers money. Mr. Cohen insists that his company, which publishes the gay-themed magazine Pinknews.co.uk, is totally innocent. Nevertheless, Google yanked the site from its AdSense service.</p>
        <p>Renaissance Men? Young men are generally neither metrosexuals nor ballcap-wearing meatheads, according to a marketing study commissioned by Miller Brewing (millerbrewing.com).</p>
        <p>As young men ''evolve,'' they ''become more interested in elevating their game without sacrificing too many of their regular-guy comforts'' but are not ''overtly concerned about fitting into cultural molds or trends.''</p>
        <p>Oh, and most of them ''prefer beer to wine and hard liquor.''</p>
        <p>Miller's news release contains this odd conclusion: ''And curiously, men who prefer wine are more likely to have a greater affinity for footwear. (A connection, perhaps?)''</p>
        <p>What are you trying to say, Miller?</p>
