        <p>FOR some suburban homeowners, the battle to keep deer at bay involves a seemingly endless switching of strategies. When rotten eggs or clumps of human hair lose effectiveness, usually after a couple of weeks, sprinklers triggered by motion detectors or strips of aluminum foil hung from poles might do the job. For another couple of weeks, that is.</p>
        <p>For those tired of the fight but nevertheless determined to keep their yards off limits to deer, there are some no-holds-barred services and strategies available.</p>

        <p>FOR some suburban homeowners, the battle to keep deer at bay involves a seemingly endless switching of strategies. When rotten eggs or clumps of human hair lose effectiveness, usually after a couple of weeks, sprinklers triggered by motion detectors or strips of aluminum foil hung from poles might do the job. For another couple of weeks, that is.</p>
        <p>For those tired of the fight but nevertheless determined to keep their yards off limits to deer, there are some no-holds-barred services and strategies available.</p>
        <p>''We engage in a battle against the deer,'' said Trevor Price, the president of Nature Technologies in Pleasantville, N.Y. ''We basically break a property up into three concentric zones.''</p>
        <p>To establish the first zone, technicians walk the perimeter to determine where deer are entering. ''For large properties, we'll even use satellite imagery to locate nearby water sources and to determine where they're coming from,'' Mr. Price said. ''Then we'll use the scent of a predator or rotting venison to create anxieties in the deer.''</p>
        <p>The next zone, Mr. Price said, is the core zone. ''There, we use auditory deterrents,'' he said, referring to the high-frequency sounds, undetectable by humans, that are emitted by the company's patented computer-controlled DeerTech 880. ''The equipment emits a sound so loud to deer that it basically blocks their ability to hear anything else.''</p>
        <p>In the last zone -- the foundation zone -- the company uses deterrents applied directly to plants, as a final line of defense. The deterrents are changed regularly so the deer never become accustomed to them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price said that the cost of the service is about $100 a month, plus a one-time charge of about $1,000 to survey the property and install the necessary equipment. The company offers a money-back guarantee if the customer is not satisfied.</p>
        <p>Another way to keep deer away is to fence them out.</p>
        <p>''We sell deer-proof fencing that is basically invisible from 20 feet away,'' said Al Benner, the president of Benner's Gardens in Conshohocken, Pa. His material is a black polypropylene mesh, seven and a half feet high, that can be attached to trees or to metal posts.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing to remember is that you have to completely enclose the area you want to protect,'' Mr. Benner said. ''Some people enclose just their garden, and some enclose the entire property.''</p>
        <p>He sells a small garden-enclosure kit, with 100 feet of fencing and the hardware to support it, for $295, including shipping.</p>
        <p>Of course, scaring deer away -- or fencing them out --means only that they will forage somewhere else, often the property next door. To avoid that, a more drastic strategy is required.</p>
        <p>Dan Beyer, one of four partners in WhiteTail Solutions in Oxford, Conn., said that his company uses experienced licensed archers to cull troublesome herds. ''We hunt from elevated tree stands, and all our shots are projected downward,'' Mr. Beyer said.</p>
        <p>The company does not charge for its services but raises income by selling advertising and hunting-related items on its Web site. And while most clients are in Fairfield County, Conn., Mr. Beyer and his partners will also work in other places where deer are a problem, provided they can get the necessary licenses. The group donates the venison to food banks and to local sporting organizations for game dinners.</p>
        <p>Lance Gegner, a specialist at the National Center for Appropriate Technology's office in Fayetteville, Ark., said that while the methods described may seem extreme, they may be necessary because deer herds in developed areas become increasingly unmanageable.</p>
        <p>''When deer get hungry, they'll eat just about anything that grows,'' he said. ''And all three options sound pretty good to me.''</p>
