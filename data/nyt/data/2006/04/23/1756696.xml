        <p>Our Underachieving Colleges  By Derek Bok  Princeton University Press  Hardcover</p>
        <p>Universities in the Marketplace  By Derek Bok  Princeton University Press  Hardcover and paperback</p>
        <p>AT the end of June, when Lawrence H. Summers finally departs from Harvard after his forced resignation, the university will install in his place a temporary caretaker: 76-year-old Derek Bok, who served as president of Harvard from 1971 to 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bok's tenure, too, was not without turmoil. He took over when Harvard was still caught up in antiwar protests and racial controversies, and he aroused a lot of ire when he was slow to divest Harvard of its investments in apartheid South Africa.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bok was a much smoother, less contentious figure, better at consulting and delegating, than Mr. Summers, and he is now remembered fondly for, among other things, driving himself to work every day in his Volkswagen (Mr. Summers took a limo) and picking up litter on the way to the office. The Harvard trustees have apparently turned to him in much the same spirit of nostalgia that might prompt certain Republicans, say, to wish that they could replace President Bush with his father.</p>
        <p>In his retirement, Mr. Bok has kept busy writing books, and his two latest -- ''Universities in the Marketplace,'' which came out in 2003, and the recently published ''Our Underachieving Colleges'' -- aren't just gloomy about college education in America, they sound a lot like Larry Summers. Mr. Summers got himself in trouble by repeatedly putting his foot in his mouth, something that Mr. Bok, who has impeccable credentials in political correctness, appears to be incapable of. But Mr. Summers also alienated a lot of faculty members by announcing that the curriculum had to be reformed. Mr. Bok, who in his first term as president oversaw the implementation of Harvard's current core curriculum, believes the same thing, and to judge from ''Our Underachieving Colleges,'' he may be even more of a hard-liner.</p>
        <p>He's just as keen as Mr. Summers on courses in foreign languages and cultures and in quantitative and moral reasoning, and he wouldn't mind some old-fashioned instruction in civics and character-building, either. He's also fairly dismissive of systems of distribution requirements, like the one Harvard has just proposed. He even goes so far as to suggest that if colleges can't properly take on the task of general education, they should just abandon the quest rather than ''perpetuate the sham of pretending to accomplish something intellectually valuable by instilling an ungainly compromise designed to win approval from a reluctant faculty or by forcing students to rummage for themselves among long lists of courses created for very different purposes.''</p>
        <p>''Universities in the Marketplace'' is concerned with the increasing commercialization of American colleges, and ''Our Underachieving Colleges'' with what students do or don't learn in their four or so years on campus. The two inevitably overlap, and they share a common assumption. In the Bok view, American colleges and universities are victims of their own success: they answer to so many constituencies and are expected to serve so many ends that no one can agree on even a few common goals, and in the meantime they have grown complacent. Few people have studied how much college students really learn and improve, Mr. Bok says, but the data that exist aren't very encouraging.</p>
        <p>In some cases, students actually appear to regress.</p>
        <p>Among the findings he cites: over four years, students in science and engineering tend to get worse at writing, not better, and students not in science or engineering experience a similar decline in quantitative reasoning. Students tend to improve at critical thinking, but not by much, and the very process of fulfilling the requirements for a major can sometimes have a dumbing-down effect. A great many majors, Mr. Bok says, impose a lot of requirements without really teaching a student how to think deeply about a subject.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, studies show that the number of students enrolling in foreign language courses has steadily declined, and so has the level of literacy that most of them achieve. In fact, no one really knows the best way of teaching a foreign language, Mr. Bok says, just as no one knows which of the various schemes for teaching writing makes the most sense. The only thing certain is that senior professors won't be taking on the chore of teaching either of these classes, which will be farmed out to adjuncts and grad students.</p>
        <p>When it comes to apportioning blame for this state of affairs, Mr. Bok does not exclude college presidents. As a group, presidents have so bungled the problem of college athletics, he says, that the system is now unfixably corrupt and hypocritical. And their lousy track record, he adds, should make trustees want to keep an eye on their presidents when it comes to negotiating other big money deals. But he also suggests that administrators are close to powerless when dealing with the one faction of the university that by and large has a stake in poor undergraduate education, or at least in not doing much to improve it: the faculty, many of whom are more concerned with advancing their own careers than with spending time in the classroom.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bok ruefully writes, ''success in increasing student learning is seldom rewarded.'' It's easier for college presidents to raise money and build buildings. By temperament and training Mr. Bok is an optimist: he's a lawyer and a legal scholar, accustomed to solving problems, and it's hard to imagine an incoming college president who has thought more about the challenges facing American education. You couldn't call him wildly hopeful, but the very reasonableness of these two books, which substitute lucid analysis and discussion for Summers-like finger-pointing or for the end-of-civilization rants delivered by the Alan Blooms, William Bennetts and other college-bashers, is at least something different.</p>
