        <p>The Rangers took the ice Saturday afternoon with nine years of playoff punches stored up inside them.</p>
        <p>They had elbows to throw, jabs to land, sticks to raise. They had taken nine years' worth of abuse, since their last playoff appearance, in 1997, and for at least one day they were going to give some back. They would not leave the playoffs again without punishing somebody for their misfortune.</p>
        <p>Like a fighter who does not protect his face, the Rangers came out flailing and wound up flattened. They committed 16 penalties. They allowed five power-play goals. They lost their star, Jaromir Jagr, to an unnecessary and self-inflicted injury. They were as aggressive as they were undisciplined, knocking themselves senseless in a 6-1 loss to the Devils at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>If one play could illustrate an entire team's lack of composure, it came late in the third period, when Jagr lost the puck to the Devils' Scott Gomez, then tried punching Gomez in a futile attempt to get it back. Jagr hurt only himself. He dropped his left arm, skated to the bench, and did not say when he could return. The Rangers said only that Jagr had an upper-body injury, but if he is out of the playoffs, his team will most likely follow.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to play my hardest until the last minute,'' Jagr said. ''Whether it's smart or not.''</p>
        <p>Jagr's rationale can surely be questioned, and the same goes for Coach Tom Renney's.</p>
        <p>Renney was using Jagr to kill a penalty in the final minutes of a game that was already lost. Renney said he wanted Jagr to practice his penalty killing. This might have been the only day when that explanation sounded remotely plausible.</p>
        <p>The Rangers missed seven seasons of playoff games so they could watch one from the penalty box. Twelve players blazed a trail to the box, allowing the Devils an unencumbered path to the net. The Devils may be famous for defense and goaltending, but their power play still has that Stanley Cup luster. Patrik Elias, out much of this season with hepatitis A, scored two goals, dished out three assists and led the Devils to their 12th consecutive victory. Goalie Martin Brodeur made 29 saves.</p>
        <p>Perhaps momentum from the regular season really does carry over to the playoffs. The Rangers have lost six games in a row and are all out of pep talks. They have resorted to tongue lashings.</p>
        <p>''We humiliated ourselves here today,'' Renney said. He added: ''It's clear we're incapable of dealing with the pressure of these situations well enough to stay out of the penalty box. It's a team that lost their poise.''</p>
        <p>He was not finished. Renney accused unnamed Rangers of being selfish, putting themselves ahead of their teammates and going out ''to take people's heads off.'' These are not the sort of accusations that will be easy to play down by Game 2 on Monday, but they also were not refuted in the Rangers' locker room.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to believe what happened out there today,'' center Steve Rucchin said. ''It's extremely embarrassing. We were embarrassed. And it's our fault. It's unacceptable. It's inexcusable.''</p>
        <p>Taking a penalty every four minutes is the surest way to be swept out of this series. Penalties keep Jagr off the ice and stewing on the bench. Thirty-two seconds into the third period, on the rare occasion when the Rangers were at full strength, Jagr committed a hooking penalty that set up the Devils' fourth goal.</p>
        <p>''We shut him down pretty well,'' Devils wing Cam Janssen said. ''If we can frustrate him like that every night, hey, we're good.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the third period, Rangers fans were tiptoeing out of the arena, Jagr was receiving treatment from doctors and Ryan Hollweg was trying to defend any shred of his team's dignity.</p>
        <p>Hollweg, a Rangers center, said he heard Janssen taunt him about a previous fight. Hollweg swiftly attacked Janssen, perhaps the only penalty that would have been condoned by the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''I know my role,'' Hollweg said. ''I'm just trying to keep guys honest.''</p>
        <p>When the Rangers and the Devils were playing five-on-five hockey, it was difficult to determine which was the better team. Each finished with 30 shots. Jagr controlled the tempo. His roommate, the rookie Petr Prucha, regained his scoring touch with a first-period goal. But the Rangers kept hooking, holding, elbowing, roughing, tripping and obstructing themselves.</p>
        <p>''We have to play smarter,'' said Henrik Lundqvist, the Rangers' rookie goalie, who made his first playoff appearance. ''We can't take so many penalties. That's what cost us today. I won't say I was struggling. But it was hard for me to see the puck.''</p>
        <p>Penalties have been a problem for the Rangers all season, but they have also been a salvation. New rules, which resulted in more whistles, gave Jagr open ice and invigorated the Rangers' offense. Their players expressed concern before the playoffs that the referees would be more lenient and not call so many penalties.</p>
        <p>That was only the first sign of the Rangers' relative inexperience. While they were trying to anticipate what would happen, the Devils were patiently waiting. Perhaps the Rangers' overeagerness should have been anticipated.</p>
        <p>After all, it has been nine years.</p>
