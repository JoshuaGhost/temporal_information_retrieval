        <p>Residents in 24 of 32 municipalities, including the state capital, voted in favor of immediately pulling out troops from Iraq in referendums on Tuesday. About 61 percent of 65,682 voters supported withdrawal in communities where as few as 22 or as many as 35,596 people cast votes. Residents petitioned to get the referendum on the ballot in each community as part of a campaign initiated by the Wisconsin Green Party. The vote brings to 100 the number of cities and towns nationwide that have passed resolutions calling for the return of troops, according to the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington.</p>
