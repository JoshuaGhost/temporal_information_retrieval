        <p>His on-camera talents are not yet known, but John Flaherty, the former Yankees backup catcher who appeared close to snaring a studio job with SportsNet New York, the Mets' channel, is headed for the YES Network.</p>
        <p>Flaherty auditioned twice as a studio analyst this week for SNY and looked a bit overwhelmed. Yesterday, he said he would work for YES.</p>
        <p>''I was flattered that they wanted me,'' Flaherty said in a telephone interview, referring to SNY. ''But when you start out on a new career, comfort level is the most important thing, and I was a lot more comfortable covering the Yankees than the Mets.''</p>
        <p>Eric Handler, a YES spokesman, said the network was looking at using Flaherty in its new half-hour batting-practice show, which will be carried before the Yankees' pregame program.</p>
