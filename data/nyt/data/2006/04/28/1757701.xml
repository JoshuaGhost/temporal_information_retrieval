        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig has taken notice of the nearly 25 percent increase in home runs in the first month of the season. And he was curious enough about the jump to ask that Major League Baseball test the baseballs, he disclosed yesterday during an annual meeting with newspaper sports editors in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The results of the tests are not back, said Jimmie Lee Solomon, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball who overseas the enforcement of rules regarding play. But Solomon noted that baseballs tested before the season, part of a crop that has been used in games since the season began, showed no differences from balls that were used in past seasons.</p>

        <p>Commissioner Bud Selig has taken notice of the nearly 25 percent increase in home runs in the first month of the season. And he was curious enough about the jump to ask that Major League Baseball test the baseballs, he disclosed yesterday during an annual meeting with newspaper sports editors in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The results of the tests are not back, said Jimmie Lee Solomon, an executive vice president of Major League Baseball who overseas the enforcement of rules regarding play. But Solomon noted that baseballs tested before the season, part of a crop that has been used in games since the season began, showed no differences from balls that were used in past seasons.</p>
        <p>Through Wednesday night's games, 742 home runs were hit in the first 316 games of this season, compared with 602 home runs in the first 314 games of 2005.</p>
        <p>The increase has caught the attention of some people within baseball because it has come in a season in which tougher steroid testing has been implemented, leading some to believe overall power numbers should have declined.</p>
        <p>Rob Manfred, who oversees baseball's drug policy as part of his role as an executive vice president for Major League Baseball, noted during yesterday's meeting that about half the players who have tested positive for steroids are pitchers, possibly explaining why more home runs, not less, are being hit despite the tougher drug testing.</p>
        <p>As for the baseballs, Solomon said that, normally, they are tested randomly throughout the season. But concern that the quality of the baseballs may have changed prompted a round of testing now. Solomon said that neither the manufacturer, nor the makeup of the baseballs, has changed since last season.</p>
        <p>The baseballs are tested in a laboratory under the supervision of James A. Sherwood, the director of the Baseball Research Center at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell.</p>
        <p>During yesterday's meeting, Selig played down the notion that the increase in home runs might be linked to hitters using some other substance that is not being detected by the steroid testing.</p>
        <p>''Is there something else going on?'' Selig said. ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>GIANTS -- Barry Bonds will apparently have to wait until he passes Hank Aaron before Major League Baseball throws a party for him.</p>
        <p>Baseball is not planning any celebration for Bonds if and when he tops Babe Ruth's mark of 714 home runs, Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday in his meeting with newspaper sports editors.</p>
        <p>''Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record,'' Selig said. ''We don't celebrate anybody the second or third time in.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say it wasn't significant,'' Selig said of Bonds possibly passing Ruth. ''There'll be lots of acknowledgment, but not on behalf of Major League Baseball.''</p>
        <p>Bonds, who has been the subject of steroids speculation for several seasons, hit his 711th homer Wednesday. His San Francisco Giants were off yesterday, and open a three-game series tonight at home against Arizona.</p>
        <p>Selig does not figure to be in San Francisco -- or in Milwaukee or Philadelphia, where the Giants play next week -- as Bonds nears Ruth.</p>
        <p>''We celebrate new records, that's what we do. We're being consistent,'' Selig said. ''There's nothing to read into that.''</p>
        <p>Asked what baseball would do if Bonds ultimately broke Aaron's mark of 755 homers, Selig said: ''Whatever happens, happens. We're going to let nature take its course.''</p>

        <p>NATIONALS -- Bud Selig is likely to pick a new owner for the Washington Nationals within a few days, and the team will probably change hands in June, baseball's No. 2 official, Bob DuPuy, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, said Selig intends to have major league owners vote on the sale when they meet May 17 and 18 in New York. DuPuy also said a ceremonial groundbreaking for the Nationals' new ballpark is likely to take place May 4.</p>
        <p>Eight groups have bid for the Nationals, a franchise purchased by the other 29 major league teams in 2002, when the team was known as the Montreal Expos. Baseball, which bought the Expos for $120 million, has asked for $450 million for the Nationals.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>DEVIL RAYS -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays minor leaguer Delmon Young was suspended indefinitely by the International League for striking an umpire in the chest with a flipped bat.</p>
        <p>Young, the top pick in baseball's 2003 draft and last season's minor league player of the year, was ejected by the home-plate umpire when he stayed in the batter's box after a called third strike in the first inning of Wednesday night's game between Durham and Pawtucket in Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The 20-year-old Young, playing for the Devil Rays' Class AAA Durham affiliate, then gave an underhand flip to his bat, which sailed end over end and struck the umpire about four steps away. The umpire, whose name was not released, was wearing a chest protector and was not injured, The Providence Journal reported.</p>
        <p>The International League, which is part of the top level of minor league baseball, said Young would remain suspended while the case is reviewed.</p>
