        <p>China's central bank raised lending rates on Thursday for the first time in a year and a half, in a move by Chinese leaders to rein in the world's fastest-growing economy.</p>
        <p>The action aims to slow a spectacular surge in investment and it may potentially brake China's voracious appetite on world markets for oil and other commodities.</p>
        <p>With interest rates already climbing in the United States and the European Union, and with monetary officials starting to tighten policy in Japan, China seems to be joining the world's central bankers in trying to gain control of speculation that has driven up prices of assets like gold and real estate.</p>
        <p>From steel mills and auto factories to luxury apartment buildings and plush office complexes, China has been engaged in a nationwide building boom fueled by easy loans from banks and other financial institutions.</p>
        <p>New loans soared at least 61 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the period last year, causing investment in factories and other fixed assets to climb 29.8 percent.</p>
        <p>''It is easy to borrow money,'' said Jack Lee, a manager at the Guangchan Conveyor Idlers Company in east central China, which had an 80 percent jump last year in its sales of conveyor belt rollers and is now buying more equipment to open a second production line next year.</p>
        <p>China's boom in lending and investment, which has contributed to the country's rapidly rising exports, pushed growth in China's economy to 10.2 percent in the first quarter. That was high even by China's extraordinary standards, and so strong that President Hu Jintao himself warned on April 16 that the country needed efficient, high-quality development and not ''excessively rapid economic growth.''</p>
        <p>The National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing warned on Tuesday, for example, that annual demand for cement was 1.05 billion tons while production capacity had reached 1.3 billion tons. Three-fifths of the capacity, moreover, was for low-quality cement of the sort that China's increasingly advanced economy no longer needs.</p>
        <p>The policy-setting agency called for local governments to limit new projects in a range of industries facing overcapacity, from aluminum to cars to textiles.</p>
        <p>The effectiveness of somewhat higher interest rates in slowing growth, however, remains to be seen. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said that it was raising the benchmark lending rates on one-year loans by 27-hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.85 percent. It was the same size increase as on Oct. 28, 2004, the last time China raised rates. That increase was the first in nine years.</p>
        <p>The central bank said it was acting to strengthen economic controls to ''sustain fast-paced, balanced and healthy development of the economy.''</p>
        <p>But the central bank did not change bank deposit rates. By raising lending rates while leaving deposit rates untouched, the government will allow banks to widen their profit margins to cover losses on loan defaults.</p>
        <p>Moreover, by isolating deposit rates, China's move is unlikely to address calls by industrialized countries, including the Group of 7 last weekend, for China's currency to gain in value. One-year bank deposits earn just 2.25 percent in China, and leaving that rate unchanged makes it slightly less attractive for foreign investors to pump money into China and therefore bid up the value of the yuan, the Chinese currency.</p>
        <p>Low deposit rates also encourage Chinese consumers to spend more, a government goal, rather than save. Urban savings rates exceed 40 percent, as families realize that the government has drastically reduced its role in providing pensions, health care and education.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Wen Jiabao warned on April 14 that China would move to tighten controls over lending and real estate. But most economists were taken by surprise by the central bank's decision to raise interest rates instead of imposing other lending controls.</p>
        <p>''They want to send a strong message that they are serious about seeing a slowdown in lending rates,'' said Frank Gong, the chief economist for greater China at J. P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. ''I don't think this is the start of a series of hikes, but it is to send a strong message.''</p>
        <p>Tim Condon, the chief Asian economist at ING, said that Chinese officials were probably not worried about inflation, given that the consumer price index in China was just eight-tenths of a percent higher in March than a year earlier. ''It's a pre-emptive strike -- they don't want investment to accelerate any further,'' he said.</p>
        <p>All the signs are that China's central bank has acted much earlier this time to rein in economic growth than it did the last time the economy threatened to overheat, in 2004. Chinese business leaders say that the acceleration of economic growth this spring has not caused the kinds of chaotic problems that surfaced back then, like bottlenecks in some places and excesses in others.</p>
        <p>The issue instead is the volume of fresh lending and construction, which is producing gluts of capacity that are pulling down prices in China and causing Chinese companies to export more and more of their excess production to foreign markets.</p>
