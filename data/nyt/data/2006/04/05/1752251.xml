        <p>When Greg Norman left Queensland, Australia, to play on the PGA Tour almost three decades ago, he began placing small Australian flags on his belongings.</p>
        <p>It was an ode to his native country, and also to his swing teacher there, Charlie Earp, who told Norman something he has never forgotten.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Greg, on every shot you hit, you will hit it with an Australian flag over the top of you,' '' Norman said in a telephone interview Saturday. ''That was a powerful statement. I thought, 'No matter what I did, in golf or in business or in making speeches, I would carry that flag.' It hit home.''</p>
        <p>Norman says he took pride from Earp's statement, but it held a different significance April 14, 1996, when Norman lost a six-shot lead to Nick Faldo at the Masters, and a nation wept.</p>
        <p>On the eve of the 70th Masters, which begins Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club, the 51-year-old Norman gazes across the chasm of time and sees an Australian contingent still chasing the country's first green jacket.</p>
        <p>There are 8 Australians in the field, second only to the 48 representatives from the United States, and 3 of them -- Stuart Appleby, Geoff Ogilvy and Rod Pampling -- have victories on the PGA Tour this season.</p>
        <p>Each Australian golfer works in the shadow of Norman, perhaps the country's greatest sports hero, and also one of its most star-crossed. Some of the golfers here were children or young men 10 years ago when Norman flickered onto the television screen in Australia early Monday morning on April 15, his lead dwindling, their hearts breaking.</p>
        <p>''It was shattering sitting home watching that,'' said Adam Scott, a 15-year-old in Queensland at the time who is a protégé of Norman and a strong contender in the Masters. ''I wanted it, I thought, probably just as much as he did. I had probably looked up to him for 10 years at that point. It was heartbreaking for every golfer in Australia.''</p>
        <p>Appleby, who joined the PGA Tour in 1996, said he could not remember if he watched it live or saw a highlight. Both told the same tale.</p>
        <p>''It would be a huge feat to be the first Aussie to win,'' Appleby, 34, said of the Masters. ''I think a lot of Australians have very compatible games for Augusta. I think it's a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>Norman has 88 victories around the world, including two British Open titles. He is recovering from knee surgery and is not competing in this year's Masters, but he says it is still his favorite tournament, despite the 22 times he left Magnolia Lane without a green jacket.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of golfers are identified with the Masters as much as Norman. He finished second or third six times, including in 1987, when Larry Mize chipped in on No. 11 to beat him in a playoff.</p>
        <p>His perspective on his most disappointing defeat, when he shot 78 to Faldo's 67, is blunt.</p>
        <p>''I screwed up the '96 Masters,'' Norman said. ''I take the blame for that. As long as you can do that and fall on your sword and move on, it's O.K. You look at the past of most players, they have had something happen to them.</p>
        <p>''Arnold Palmer coming back to win at Cherry Hills,'' he said of the 1960 United States Open, ''but then having a ball bury in a bunker at Augusta National in 1961,'' when Palmer made double bogey on No. 18 and lost by a shot to Gary Player.</p>
        <p>''Unless you are in the heat of the battle, you don't understand some of the things that go on inside.''</p>
        <p>If an Australian golfer is in the hunt this week at the Masters, Norman's name will inevitably come up. If that golfer wins, Norman could become a central character.</p>
        <p>''An Australian is going to break through shortly, possibly this April,'' Jim Nantz, the CBS golf anchor at the Masters, said in a recent telephone interview. ''And when that happens, you watch. The first guy that is going to be mentioned in the green-jacket ceremony is going to be Greg.</p>
        <p>''For a whole generation of golfers, he defined grace in defeat, and I think it emboldened, in the mind of young Australians, the importance of coming in and finishing the task at Augusta.''</p>
        <p>Norman said: ''If a countryman wins the Masters, I would be extremely proud of them. I don't have any jealousy or negativity if they do better than I did. I know how hard it is to achieve a certain level.''</p>
        <p>Norman remains a hero in Australia. His multinational corporation, Great White Shark Enterprises, has offices in Sydney, Australia, and Jupiter, Fla. His business includes wine, restaurants, golf-course design and clothing.</p>
        <p>In 2000, Norman carried the Olympic torch across the Sydney Harbor Bridge at dawn. In his left hand, he clutched an Australian flag.</p>
        <p>NOTES</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods, whose father, Earl, has prostate cancer, is carrying a ball marker his father gave him. Woods said his father was fighting, but Earl, 74, was unable to join his son this week at the tournament. ''It is what it is, and you just deal with it,'' Woods said. ''Everyone who has had a family member, or lived that long, you're going to deal with it sometime. Unfortunately, it's our time right now.''  Woods, the defending champion, will be paired with Edoardo Molinari of Italy, the United States Amateur champion, and Robert Allenby of Australia at 10:23 a.m. for the first round on Thursday.</p>
