        <p>As Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, moves from the defense table to the witness stand as soon as today, he will have to be prepared to confront his own past testimony.</p>
        <p>At his trial in Houston, Mr. Skilling will be bound by the very words he spoke under oath in secret testimony given more than four years ago, at a time when the Enron criminal investigation had not yet begun.</p>
        <p>The testimony, taken in December 2001 as part of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into the Enron debacle, serves as a road map to the defense Mr. Skilling will offer on the stand. It also points up some potential pitfalls he faces. A transcript of the testimony, which has not been made public, was obtained by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The transcript lays out not only what is sure to be the foundation of Mr. Skilling's own explanation for what went wrong at Enron, but also the words that could be used against him in cross-examination.</p>
        <p>At the heart of Mr. Skilling's statements in his previous testimony was a simple refrain: Enron took every precaution; everything was legal; nothing was hidden; nothing was improper. But Mr. Skilling also advanced the argument that if anything illegal had occurred, he could not possibly have been on top of every transaction at Enron, simply because the company was too sprawling for any one person to control.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I couldn't see the whole company,'' Mr. Skilling testified when discussing his familiarity with the company's financial disclosures. ''I mean, this was a gigantic company.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Skilling's S.E.C. testimony appears to be in direct contradiction to statements made by prosecution witnesses in the nine weeks of the criminal trial so far. For example, at one point in the testimony, Mr. Skilling was asked by a government investigator whether Enron ever used reserves to help the company meet Wall Street's earnings expectations. Mr. Skilling flatly denied that, and went on to deny that any reserves existed for such a purpose.</p>
        <p>Likewise, in Mr. Skilling's S.E.C. testimony, he denied that there were ever any last-minute dashes within Enron to meet quarterly earnings expectations from 1997, when he took on a top job at the company, to his departure in the summer of 2001.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there was any time during that time period,'' he testified, ''that by the end of the quarter we were concerned about the numbers.''</p>
        <p>But in the criminal trial, several witnesses, including Wesley H. Colwell, a former Enron accountant, testified that Enron used accounting reserves to lift the company's earnings in particular quarters for the purpose of meeting the projections of Wall Street analysts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colwell and other witnesses portrayed last-minute efforts to meet -- and in one instance, to beat -- those projections, requiring what they described as manipulations involving a penny or two of earnings per share.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colwell testified that in July 2000, for example, Enron improperly dipped into reserves to increase earnings by $14 million, or from 32 cents a share to 34 cents a share, a change driven simply by management's desire ''to make 34 cents per share'' that period.</p>
        <p>During the trial, government witnesses also portrayed a particular credit reserve, called Schedule C, as something of a ''cookie jar'' of earnings that could be used to help improve the company's reported performance. The earnings used in Schedule C were the product of the California energy crisis in 2000, which brought huge profits to Enron and other energy trading firms.</p>
        <p>In his earlier testimony, Mr. Skilling said that Schedule C was a proper accounting reserve, which had been put together by Enron not to bolster earnings, but because of concerns the company had that California utilities that owed the money would never be able to pay because of their own financial troubles.</p>
        <p>''The loss from PG&amp;E alone was, I think, $560 million,'' Mr. Skilling testified. ''These were significant numbers and so we started to reserve for those just to make sure that we could cover them if something did happen.''</p>
        <p>In the course of his S.E.C. testimony, Mr. Skilling also addressed the company's use of special-purpose entities that resulted in the company's shifting debt off the books -- one of the central issues in the Enron scandal.</p>
        <p>Such entities are commonly used throughout corporate America for that purpose, but to meet the accounting standards, investors independent of the company must provide a set percentage of the capital.</p>
        <p>The accounting for several such entities proved to be improper, and several former Enron officials have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to them. The restatement of the company's financial statements after those problems were discovered played a significant role in its ultimate collapse into bankruptcy in late 2001.</p>
        <p>In his S.E.C. testimony, Mr. Skilling said that he had no knowledge of any problems with the accounting for transactions involving the entities.</p>
        <p>''I had absolutely no reason, given the process and the signoffs, to have any expectation that the accounting did not properly reflect what the transactions -- the way the transactions were structured,'' Mr. Skilling told the investigators in 2001. Mr. Skilling also discussed two entities affiliated with Enron that have been the subject of frequent testimony during the government case. One is LJM2, an investment fund operated by Andrew S. Fastow, who was Enron's chief financial officer; the fund was used for transactions with Enron.</p>
        <p>Another is the Raptors, four partnerships used to provide hedges for company investments. A hedge, traditionally, is used to offset potential losses, with the value of the hedge going up as the value of the investment goes down.</p>
        <p>The Raptors involved special purpose entities, requiring an outside investor. Mr. Fastow provided that outside capital through LJM2, which he led as general partner, handling investments from financial institutions and wealthy individuals.</p>
        <p>But the Enron transactions, according to prosecution witnesses, were highly improper because they relied on secret side deals protecting Mr. Fastow and LJM2 from losses and similar problems undermining the Raptors.</p>
        <p>In his S.E.C. testimony, Mr. Skilling was not asked if LJM2 received widespread guarantees against loss from Enron, which would be illegal. But he denied the existence of any secret side agreement that would have protected the investment fund from making good on its financial commitments.</p>
        <p>As for the Raptors themselves, Mr. Skilling professed to have little knowledge of their workings, but said he knew that the company's accountants and Arthur Andersen, its auditing firm, had signed off on the deals.</p>
        <p>''I cannot describe Project Raptor to you,'' Mr. Skilling testified. ''Arthur Andersen was totally on board. They'd look at the structure and the governance and all the rest of the stuff. They thought it was fine, and it looked like it was a good way to hedge some of these high-technology investments that we had made. So it was approved by the board. But I don't recall the mechanics of how it worked.''</p>
        <p>But Ben F. Glisan Jr., the former treasurer, testified in the trial that he listed ''accounting scrutiny'' as his chief concern when he presented a Raptor hedging transaction to the board's finance committee in May 2000. Mr. Skilling, according to Mr. Glisan, told the directors at the meeting that day that Raptor was not a deal he would recommend ''except for the fact that it allowed him to circumvent the accounting rules.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Skilling also portrayed himself in his S.E.C. testimony as something of a casual reader of Enron's financial statements, saying that he had placed his confidence in the company's financial controls to satisfy himself that the reporting was proper.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you I read them, you know, cover to cover,'' Mr. Skilling testified about the financial statements. ''I felt by the time that process was completed that it was a fair and accurate presentation of what was going on in the company.''</p>
