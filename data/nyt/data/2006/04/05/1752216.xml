        <p>The Times is changing its daily financial tables, replacing the six existing pages with two pages of analytical tools and summary information on the markets and the economy.</p>
        <p>As part of a continuing effort to integrate The Times and its Web version, online readers will be able to choose from an array of new functions, including a host of interactive graphics. Today's Sector Snapshot chart can be found on Page C10.</p>
        <p>Readers will also be able to receive closing prices of their stocks and mutual funds by e-mail and will be able to receive midday alerts about sharp price shifts or business news that affects them.</p>
        <p>Full financial tables will continue to appear in the Sunday newspaper, covering stocks, bonds, mutual funds and foreign markets.</p>
        <p>Comments about the changes may be e-mailed to tables@nytimes.com or telephoned to (212) 556-3715.</p>
