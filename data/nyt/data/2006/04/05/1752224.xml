        <p>WASHINGTON, April 4 Â— Representative Tom DeLay's decision to resign his House seat came as federal prosecutors continued to investigate the aides who once made up his inner circle, leaving Mr. DeLay dispirited, potentially intensifying his legal troubles and further undercutting his prospects for re-election in the fall, lawmakers and others said Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Representative Tom DeLay's decision to resign his House seat came as federal prosecutors continued to investigate the aides who once made up his inner circle, leaving Mr. DeLay dispirited, potentially intensifying his legal troubles and further undercutting his prospects for re-election in the fall, lawmakers and others said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''I have no fear whatsoever about any investigation into me or my personal or professional activities,'' Mr. DeLay said in a formal announcement of his decision to constituents in the suburban Houston district he has represented since 1985, issued Tuesday morning as a written statement and a video on his Web site.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay said his announcement on Tuesday was unrelated to a former senior aide's guilty plea last week to corruption charges, the latest admission of wrongdoing in the Jack Abramoff scandal by onetime staff members. Another of Mr. DeLay's former aides has also pleaded guilty, and prosecutors publicly signaled last week that they were examining the activities of a third.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay is also under indictment in Texas on charges that he broke campaign finance laws, and he faced the prospect of an inquiry by the House ethics committee into travel arranged by Mr. Abramoff.</p>
        <p>Some suggested it was no coincidence that his decision to resign and forgo a re-election bid came after the plea bargain last week by Tony Rudy, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. DeLay. Mr. Rudy is cooperating with federal investigators.</p>
        <p>''The two of them have been very close over the years,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, referring to Mr. DeLay and Mr. Rudy. ''Every story that is written will include DeLay's name, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Democrats cheered the departure of Mr. DeLay, who said he would leave Congress by mid-June. They said that he had only himself to blame for the abrupt end to his public career and that his decision to quit the House would not spare Republicans from a voter backlash.</p>
        <p>''Tom DeLay's legacy of abuse of power, strong-arm tactics, broken House rules and pay-to-play politics has cast a long, dark shadow over this majority leadership and the entire Congress,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee. ''DeLay may be gone, but this is still his Congress.''</p>
        <p>President Bush, who spoke with Mr. DeLay on Monday, said he ''wished him all the best,'' but added that Republicans would continue to flourish ''because we're the party of ideas.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the White House had not pushed Mr. DeLay to step down.</p>
        <p>Privately, some senior Republicans said Mr. DeLay should have acted months ago, when Mr. Abramoff entered his guilty plea and when Mr. DeLay abandoned plans to try to regain the majority leader post he vacated after being indicted in Texas. Party strategists said his decision not to seek re-election could ease the way for other embattled Republicans, with Democrats losing a prime target for their claims of widespread corruption.</p>
        <p>''In Richard Nixon terms, you won't have Tom DeLay to kick around anymore,'' said Representative Thomas M. Reynolds of New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. He predicted that Republicans would easily hold Mr. DeLay's seat.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Rudy, another former top DeLay aide, Michael Scanlon, has pleaded guilty in the corruption case and is cooperating with prosecutors. The third former aide to be caught up in the investigation, Edwin A. Buckham, was among Mr. DeLay's closest associates, and the Justice Department is seeking to build a conspiracy case against him, people involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Phone calls to a home telephone number listed under Mr. Buckham's name in Maryland were not returned. A Washington lawyer who has recently represented Mr. Buckham, Laura A. Miller, did not return repeated phone calls.</p>
        <p>Another close associate said that Mr. DeLay had been consistent in telling friends he had done nothing wrong, but that he had become dispirited in recent weeks because many of his former aides and closest friends were becoming targets of the Justice Department and were being pressured to incriminate him.</p>
        <p>''Tony Rudy and especially Ed Buckham were more than just former colleagues -- they are Tom DeLay's friends,'' the associate said. ''You can imagine what it feels like: to know that your friends are being squeezed to say terrible things about you, things that aren't true. By leaving the House now, I think DeLay hopes that the spotlight on him and his friends will dim a little.''</p>
        <p>The associate spoke on condition of anonymity because, he said, Mr. DeLay had insisted that friends not talk to reporters about his legal troubles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudy pleaded guilty last week to conspiring to corrupt public officials, although his plea agreement made no direct accusation of wrongdoing against Mr. DeLay. In a public indication that Mr. Buckham, Mr. DeLay's former chief of staff, was under scrutiny, federal law enforcement officials confirmed that he was the person referred to as ''Lobbyist B'' in court documents released as part of Mr. Rudy's plea agreement.</p>
        <p>In announcing that he would relinquish the House seat he built into a formidable power center, Mr. DeLay acknowledged that the criminal inquiries had exacted a toll on his election prospects and his will to remain in Congress.</p>
        <p>''Because I care so deeply about this district and the people in it, I refuse to allow liberal Democrats an opportunity to steal this seat with a negative, personal campaign,'' he said in the statement to constituents.</p>
        <p>Colleagues and others said that even as Mr. DeLay was campaigning for re-election, he was preparing to exit the race after the primary if his political troubles appeared too deep. The more than $1.2 million in campaign contributions he amassed could now be used for legal fees.</p>
        <p>In explaining the decision to resign, Mr. DeLay and others described as a turning point a speech he gave last week on the nexus between Christianity and America's place in the world.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Rick Scarborough, the founder of Vision America and former pastor of a Houston church that Mr. DeLay sometimes attended, had asked Mr. DeLay to give that speech, at a conference titled ''The War Against Christians'' in Washington last Tuesday. He ran into Mr. DeLay again Saturday night at Sugar Creek Baptist Church in Houston.</p>
        <p>''He pulled me aside and said that at our conference he had finally made a decision that was going to be difficult for him to announce but that God wanted him to get out of that race,'' Mr. Scarborough said.</p>
