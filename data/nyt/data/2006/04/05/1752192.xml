        <p>Chris and Mandi Hunt stood in front of their house here on Tuesday and watched as a backhoe scooped what was left of it into a dump truck. In what had been their living room, a child's board game sat on the floor amid Monopoly money, in a heap of timber, broken glass and insulation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hunt pointed to the hallway closet, where the couple and their two daughters had huddled as Mr. Hunt struggled to hold the door shut against the winds of a tornado. As he grasped the knob, the door was ripped from its hinges and out of his hand, and it whirled into another room. The parents prayed. The girls screamed.</p>

        <p>Dyer County and neighboring Gibson County in Tennessee were among the hardest hit by tornadoes that struck eight states.</p>

        <p>Chris and Mandi Hunt stood in front of their house here on Tuesday and watched as a backhoe scooped what was left of it into a dump truck. In what had been their living room, a child's board game sat on the floor amid Monopoly money, in a heap of timber, broken glass and insulation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hunt pointed to the hallway closet, where the couple and their two daughters had huddled as Mr. Hunt struggled to hold the door shut against the winds of a tornado. As he grasped the knob, the door was ripped from its hinges and out of his hand, and it whirled into another room. The parents prayed. The girls screamed.</p>
        <p>When the tornado had passed, the family found that it had laid open their home, toppling the walls and tossing off the roof. Debris had fallen on their daughters' beds, where they would have been sleeping. But the couple's made bed was untouched, and a candle Ms. Hunt had lighted still burned at the bedside.</p>
        <p>''It's sad,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''Everything that's ever been done to that house, we did it. We did it with our hands.''</p>
        <p>The Hunts were not alone. Across Dyer County and neighboring Gibson County, stunned homeowners returned to their houses, some merely damaged, some obliterated, for the slow and painful process of searching for scattered belongings and deciding what to do.</p>
        <p>Tennessee was one of eight states where tornadoes touched down on Sunday evening. But the enormous tornado that raged across the two counties, and a less powerful one to the north, created the greatest destruction. Of 28 people who died throughout the South and the Midwest, 24 died in the two Tennessee counties. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed.</p>
        <p>Convoys of utility trucks rumbled along the streets, and bucket loaders hoisted workers up to replace downed power lines. The sound of generators, chainsaws and chippers roared in the neighborhoods where trees still rested on the roadsides and vast piles of brush were piled in yards.</p>
        <p>The storms left a gash of ruin and debris, transforming the landscape as a vast swath of wreckage was scattered in fields and in ditches.</p>
        <p>Gov. Phil Bredesen toured the two counties on Tuesday. One of the officials with him was Representative John Tanner, a Democrat. Mr. Tanner's cousin Janie King was among those killed on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''As bad as the property damage is, it can be replaced,'' Mr. Tanner said. ''It's just stuff. The loss of life -- my family isn't the only one that suffered -- is something that's forever. You've got to get through the grief for the people that died, and the rebuilding will take place in due course.''</p>
        <p>When Billy Sisk left for work last Sunday, his one-story house was a solid concrete-and-timber monument to hard work. When Mr. Sisk returned after the tornado had ripped through, little was left: the cinderblock foundation, the front porch, the furnace pointing skyward amid the ruins.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Sisk, 39, picked his way among the debris, poking through a splintered cabinet and scanning the ground for anything salvageable. His family's possessions were scattered around him as he made his way through the yard, passing an electric meat cleaver, a boot, a child's arrow, a muddy phone receiver.</p>
        <p>''When we got back here the next morning, we didn't have a house,'' Mr. Sisk said. ''You work hard all these years and try to have something in life, and in a split second, it's gone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sisk was at work on Sunday night when his wife, Betty, and two children had to cling together inside a closet as the house disintegrated around them. The tornado flung Ms. Sisk and the two children into the yard. They later found out that the couple next door had been killed, along with their infant grandchild.</p>
        <p>''It's something you see on TV,'' Ms. Sisk said. ''It's something you read about, but it's not something you ever think about. You can't grasp it.''</p>
