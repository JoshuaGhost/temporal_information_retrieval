        <p>HAND-WRINGING seems to be the opera fan's stock in trade. Perhaps we even enjoy it. Nothing is as good today, we moan, as it was in the old days, and if you don't believe us, we can present you with stacks of recordings to prove it. If you're not familiar with our old recordings, it sends us into yet another paroxysm: not only is our beloved legacy vanishing, but it is being forgotten.</p>
        <p>I understand the aspects of this posture that lend themselves to parody; it has been the posture of opera fans for the last two centuries. Every age is the one after the golden age that has just been lost. To 18th-century purists, Handel's singers were decadent.

        <p>HAND-WRINGING seems to be the opera fan's stock in trade. Perhaps we even enjoy it. Nothing is as good today, we moan, as it was in the old days, and if you don't believe us, we can present you with stacks of recordings to prove it. If you're not familiar with our old recordings, it sends us into yet another paroxysm: not only is our beloved legacy vanishing, but it is being forgotten.</p>
        <p>I understand the aspects of this posture that lend themselves to parody; it has been the posture of opera fans for the last two centuries. Every age is the one after the golden age that has just been lost. To 18th-century purists, Handel's singers were decadent. In the 19th century, Wagner's wife, Cosima, deplored the lamentable state of modern singing.</p>
        <p>But when I present you with the recordings of Olive Middleton, you may think I've taken leave of my senses. Middleton's singing goes beyond parody. And it goes well beyond good singing. It's just plain awful.</p>
        <p>Middleton, who died in 1974, was a British singer who had once had an actual voice and career. But by the 1960's, when she was prima donna assoluta of La Puma Opera Workshop in New York, she had hardly any voice at all. Her sound swooped and squawked in vague proximity to the pitches of the toughest roles in the repertory: Tosca, Aida, Sieglinde. It didn't seem to bother her, and it certainly got attention. Like Florence Foster Jenkins before her, she amassed a coterie of adoring fans who greeted her every entrance with thunderous applause and continually demanded that she learn new roles, like Bellini's Norma.</p>
        <p>Now it turns out that many of her performances were captured on tape, and the fruits of her labors -- which are being archived by Donald Collup, a singer and documentarian, and are available on his Web site (collup.com) -- make for amazing, and amusing, listening.</p>
        <p>Call her an emblem of opera. For all opera hovers on the border of parody. No other performing art -- except possibly dance -- so exposes its practitioners to ridicule. Part of the thrill of opera is pitting sheer volume against human limitations, the constant awareness of the possibility of failure. A pianist may strike wrong notes in performance, but the instrument is unlikely to break apart onstage (as Ms. Middleton's regularly did). And the physical things a singer does to transcend those limitations -- to produce an unamplified sound that can carry over an orchestra and fill a 3,000-seat auditorium -- make even a functioning operatic voice both distinctive and easy to mock.</p>
        <p>Yet as noted in these pages before, expectations of opera, and of the voices that sing it, are changing. Recordings have affected our notion of sound, with big, meaty voices being supplanted by lighter, more phonogenic ones. Singing has grown careful; performers are aware that any slip can be captured and played again and again. Large voices generally don't record as well as smaller ones (and all sizes are equal before the microphone). And young singers are called on to perform a variety of works, from early music to contemporary opera, that was unimaginable a few decades ago and that places flexibility ahead of sheer emotion.</p>
        <p>For us hand-wringers, this can all be construed as a terrible thing, but others may not see any reason to worry. As someone recently pointed out to me, this kind of evolution in our expectations of sound is taking place throughout classical music. Orchestras, for example, are reaching for greater stylistic versatility, arguably at the expense of distinctive regional and national styles. And a lighter, more agile sound certainly fits the aesthetic of many contemporary composers; some of the best vastly prefer stylistic flexibility to the relative rigidity of an instrument trained to cope with the demands of 19th-century melodrama.</p>
        <p>I'm all for progress. But it's worth observing that a number of these attempts represent a step away from the larger-than-life, over-the-top element -- the element of parody, if you will -- that is exactly what draws those who love opera to the art form in the first place.</p>
        <p>Die-hard opera lovers seem to cling to parody, as if in response. How else to explain the wave of interest in Florence Foster Jenkins, who filled Carnegie Hall with an audience that came to laugh at her, and who was recently the subject of two different plays, on Broadway and in London's West End? Or the perennial popularity of Madame Vera Galupe-Borszkh, the alter ego of the tenor Ira Siff, a bewigged and besequined Russian diva who melds Italian verismo with her own brand of stand-up comedy?</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Madame Vera gave her 20th annual farewell recital -- supposedly, truly her last -- and showed once again that she has earned her cult following by espousing traditional operatic values: the ability to create a character, engage an audience and, yes, sing well. (Mr. Siff has a mean falsetto.)</p>
        <p>Or sing badly, like Middleton. And this is her enduring claim to our attention. You can take this as evidence that we grousing opera lovers will fetishize any aspect of the past that contains any drop of a bygone opera spirit. But what emerges from her performances is something that is often missing from opera now and -- let's admit it -- was then: the Romantic notion that this art form is at once larger than life and vitally true, and that it matters more to its practitioner than anything else. Love of music: it sounds na√Øve enough to be a parody. But I maintain, at the risk of ridicule, that the Middleton legacy is something worth remembering.</p>
