        <p>The iPod offers solace amid the tedium of a morning commuting trip or a boring workday. It can also rip you from dreamland.</p>
        <p>The XtremeMac Luna is an iPod dock that doubles as a clock radio. It has two independent alarms that offer the familiar squalling noise or gentle music of your choice, and it provides a generous snooze time of up to 60 minutes. You can even set the audio alarms to increase or decrease in volume over time.</p>

        <p>The iPod offers solace amid the tedium of a morning commuting trip or a boring workday. It can also rip you from dreamland.</p>
        <p>The XtremeMac Luna is an iPod dock that doubles as a clock radio. It has two independent alarms that offer the familiar squalling noise or gentle music of your choice, and it provides a generous snooze time of up to 60 minutes. You can even set the audio alarms to increase or decrease in volume over time.</p>
        <p>The Luna has a line-in port for connecting the iPod Shuffle or other audio devices, as well as an AM/FM radio. The clock has four buttons that double as dials to fine-tune the radio and clock settings. The Luna's black-and-white display mimics the iPod's user interface.</p>
        <p>The unit includes a small remote control and has an alarm backup that runs on two AA batteries in case of power failures. It connects to all current iPods with a dock connector, and is also compatible with some older iPods.</p>
        <p>The clock will be available Dec. 18 for $150 in retail stores and online; it can be preordered at www.xtrememac.com. Just try not to blame your iPod for your early-morning irritability. It's the clock's fault.</p>
