        <p>MERRY, INDEED With one week to go before Christmas and two weeks before New Year's Day, there are still bonuses and earnings to be awarded and announced on Wall Street, but already there have been a lot of merry tidings. Last week Morgan Stanley said that it was giving its chairman and chief executive, John J. Mack, right, $40 million in stock and options for 2006. Tomorrow, Morgan Stanley will present its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, with profit expected to be up sharply, as it has been at the other big investment houses.</p>
        <p>ECONOMIC DRUMBEAT The drumbeat of economic reports continues this week, when the government will report the third-quarter current-account deficit (Monday), the producer price index for November (Tuesday) and the final number for third-quarter gross domestic product (Thursday). Other reports will include November housing starts (Tuesday); Conference Board leading economic indicators (Thursday); and November durable goods, November personal income and spending, and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index (Friday).</p>
        <p>THE WEEK IN EARNINGS Corporate earnings reports this week include Oracle and Hovnanian Enterprises (Monday); Circuit City, Darden Restaurants and Palm Inc. (Tuesday); Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Biomet, CarMax, FedEx and Nike (Wednesday); Carnival Corporation, ConAgra, General Mills, Research in Motion and Rite Aid (Thursday); and Walgreen (Friday).</p>
        <p>BOND MARKET CLOSING EARLY The bond market will close early, at 2 p.m., on Friday ahead of the holiday.</p>
