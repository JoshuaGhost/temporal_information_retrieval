        <p>The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in ''Hermanas'' (''Sisters''), a perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff.</p>
        <p>After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio), a restless journalist, has traveled to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother struggling to distance herself from her family's turbulent past. But as the women seek reconciliation across a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions, the discovery of a novel written by their father raises specters neither can ignore.</p>
        <p>By means of extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship, ''Hermanas'' taps into a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. Though constrained by a directing style that insists on coloring within the lines, the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the sisters renegotiate their relationship and in which Elena, struggling with English, endures the painful process of assimilation.</p>
        <p>A scene in which she embarrasses her young son by swearing during a fumbling conversation with his teacher is both surprisingly touching and stingingly authentic.</p>
        <p>Moments like this reveal more about the sisters than the political secrets that drive the film, and Ms. Solomonoff allows them to resonate.</p>
        <p>''Make me look good,'' pleads Elena when Natalia takes her radical views -- and a thrift-store pick-up -- to a party organized in her honor. She doesn't. But both actresses make their director look very good indeed.</p>
        <p>Hermanas  Opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) and directed by Julia Solomonoff; director of photography, Ms. Solomonoff; edited by Rosario Suarez; music by Lucio Godoy; produced by Vanessa Ragone, Florencia Enghel and Mariela Besuievsky; released by Cinema Tropical. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Valeria Bertuccelli (Elena Levin), Ingrid Rubio (Natalia Levin), Adrián Navarro (Sebastian Morini), Nicolás Pauls (Martin Garcia Solis), Milton De La Canal (Tomás Morini), Horacio Peña (David Levin), Mónica Galán (Marta Levin) and Eusebio Poncela (Luis Morini).</p>
