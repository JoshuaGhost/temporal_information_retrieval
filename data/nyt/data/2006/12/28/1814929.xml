        <p>Massachusetts highest court rules that it does not have authority to order legislature to vote on propos ed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; court chastises legislature when it called recess without voting on measure and deferred it until final hours of session on January 2 (S)</p>

        <p>The state's highest court ruled that it did not have the authority to order the legislature to vote on a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. But the court also chastised the legislature, saying it had exhibited ''indifference to, or defiance of, its constitutional duties'' in November when it called a recess without voting on the measure and deferred considering it until the final hours of the final day of the session, Jan. 2. Gov. Mitt Romney and other opponents of same-sex marriage had asked the court to order lawmakers to vote on the measure on Jan. 2. It would almost certainly get the 50 votes needed to advance to the next stage of the approval process (it would need to be approved by another legislative vote in 2007-2008 and then be approved by voters in a referendum). It was not clear whether the court's ruling would prompt legislators to vote on the amendment on Jan. 2, or whether they would adjourn without voting, effectively killing the bill.</p>
