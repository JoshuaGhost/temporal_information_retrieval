        <p>Justin Miller, the Jets' All-Pro kick returner, chased down a photographer in the locker room Wednesday and asked to look at a thumbnail picture of linebacker Brad Kassell that had just been taken.</p>
        <p>Miller, in a light moment, said he heard a rumor that the photographer had caught Kassell, whose mug nearly shot to the top of a most wanted list for Jets fans after a special-teams mishap led to a game-tying 25-yard field goal by the Dolphins on Monday night.

        <p>Late in the fourth quarter of Monday night’s game against the Dolphins, a 28-yard Dolphins punt deflected off Brad Kassell’s back.</p>

        <p>Justin Miller, the Jets' All-Pro kick returner, chased down a photographer in the locker room Wednesday and asked to look at a thumbnail picture of linebacker Brad Kassell that had just been taken.</p>
        <p>Miller, in a light moment, said he heard a rumor that the photographer had caught Kassell, whose mug nearly shot to the top of a most wanted list for Jets fans after a special-teams mishap led to a game-tying 25-yard field goal by the Dolphins on Monday night. Knowing Kassell as he does, Miller found the capture hard to believe. He wanted proof.</p>
        <p>Looking over the photographer's shoulder, Miller stared at the digital image of Kassell's smiling face as if he were looking at a stranger.</p>
        <p>The Kassell whom the Jets see every day is more of a scowler than a grinner. On the field he is as intense as the heat under a pot of boiling water. He is known for his concussive hits -- in practice.</p>
        <p>''He comes out and he's just banging like it's game day,'' receiver Jerricho Cotchery said. ''Everybody on the offense knows what he does.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''You know if he comes and knocks you out, he's coming to knock you out on the next play. So you better be ready.''</p>
        <p>Kassell, who comes from a small town in the Texas hill country, is a hard-nosed player and has a permanent scab on the bridge of his nose to prove it.</p>
        <p>''He's got that toughness, that country toughness,'' Jets Coach Eric Mangini said Thursday.</p>
        <p>Kassell grew up in Llano, Tex. (population 2,300), a town that is a patchwork quilt of ranches. It is the kind of place where everybody knows his name. The woman who answered the telephone Thursday at the Llano Chamber of Commerce just happened to be an acquaintance of Kassell's father, mother, mother-in-law and a couple other relatives of his and cheerfully volunteered short biographies of each.</p>
        <p>After going undrafted out of North Texas in 2002, Kassell signed as a free agent with the Tennessee Titans and appeared in 56 games over the next four years. He started 32 games at middle linebacker before signing with the Jets as an unrestricted free agent in April.</p>
        <p>Kassell distinguished himself with the Titans for being the player most likely to end up in the middle of any fights that broke out at practice. Cotchery was not surprised to hear that.</p>
        <p>''You see a lot of that from him,'' he said. ''But if he's doing his pushing or shoving or something else, it helps everybody pick up their intensity.''</p>
        <p>Kassell, who is 6-foot-3 and 242 pounds, knows no other way to play. ''Maybe if you've got less talent,'' he said, ''you've got to play like that.''</p>
        <p>Kassell, 26, has made one start for the Jets, in Week 5 at Jacksonville. He stands out on special teams because of the crushing blows he delivers. On Monday night against the Dolphins, he was dealt one without being touched by another player.</p>
        <p>Late in the fourth quarter, a 28-yard punt by the Dolphins' Donnie Jones deflected off Kassell's back. He heard his teammates shouting the code word for a short punt -- Peter -- but could not get out of the way of the ball.</p>
        <p>Kassell said he felt something graze his back but had no idea it was the ball. ''There was just no way to get out of the way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Upon realizing what had happened, Kassell's initial reaction was, well, unprintable. ''That's about all that came into my mind,'' he said, repeating the expletive.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins' long snapper, John Denney, fell on the football, giving Miami possession at the Jets' 42-yard line. Eight plays later, Olindo Mare made a 25-yard field goal to tie the score at 10-10.</p>
        <p>With 10 seconds remaining in regulation, the Jets' Mike Nugent converted the game-winning 30-yard field goal to deliver Kassell from ignominy.</p>
        <p>''My mom called me after the game and said she felt bad about that play,'' Kassell said, ''but I said it didn't make me feel bad. Once you win, it all washed away.'' He added: ''Now it won't even be remembered. But if we had lost, it would have hung around for a long time.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Starting cornerback Andre Dyson left the Dolphins' game late in the third quarter with an injured right leg and did not return. He did a little running during drills at the beginning of practice Thursday. Receiver Laveranues Coles, who took a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter Monday night, caught some passes on a route-polishing drill, but did not practice for the second consecutive day. When asked if Coles sustained a concussion, Jets Coach Eric Mangini said: ''He got hit in the head. That's what it is.''  Some tickets remain for Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders at the Meadowlands. They can be purchased at ticketmaster.com.</p>
