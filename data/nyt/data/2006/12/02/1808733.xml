        <p>I CAUGHT my reflection in the doors of the New York Jets locker room, and almost dropped my helmet. I figured it was a judgment call as to whether I looked scarier in my football uniform with the red number ''0'' jersey or in the werewolf costume with the gray fake fur I'd worn the night before on Halloween.</p>
        <p>Before I could seek an official ruling, the digital clock on the locker room wall flashed 2:15. It was time for me to take the field as a writer in executive pursuit of becoming an N.F.L. quarterback. I had three plays to run. They would show whether I was a ''Paper Jet'' worthy of carrying on the tradition my late friend George Plimpton established with his 1965 bestseller, ''Paper Lion,'' or just another dreamer without a throwing arm.</p>

        <p>Harry Hurt runs three plays as a “Paper Jet.” Although he doesn’t run for daylight, he doesn’t fumble either.</p>

        <p>I CAUGHT my reflection in the doors of the New York Jets locker room, and almost dropped my helmet. I figured it was a judgment call as to whether I looked scarier in my football uniform with the red number ''0'' jersey or in the werewolf costume with the gray fake fur I'd worn the night before on Halloween.</p>
        <p>Before I could seek an official ruling, the digital clock on the locker room wall flashed 2:15. It was time for me to take the field as a writer in executive pursuit of becoming an N.F.L. quarterback. I had three plays to run. They would show whether I was a ''Paper Jet'' worthy of carrying on the tradition my late friend George Plimpton established with his 1965 bestseller, ''Paper Lion,'' or just another dreamer without a throwing arm.</p>
        <p>I pulled on my helmet and burst through the locker room doors.</p>
        <p>The afternoon sun was piercing a daylong cloud cover. I could see virtually the entire Jets roster working out on the practice field. Save for the other quarterbacks who had red jerseys like mine signifying we were off-limits to tacklers, half of the players wore white jerseys with green numbers and the other half wore green with white numbers. Concert volume rap music blared from outdoor speakers.</p>
        <p>The offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer waved me to the sidelines for a final dress rehearsal. Nick Mangold, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound rookie center, crouched over to deliver my first practice snaps. I was mortally afraid Nick would hike the ball so hard my hands would break. But he laid it in my palms like a pigskin pillow.</p>
        <p>My second fear was that I'd suffer a 54-year-old's senior moment, and forget how to call my three plays. I actually blurted the correct words, but my voice was so loud it could be heard out on the adjacent turnpike. ''Keep your voice down in the huddle,'' the starting quarterback Chad Pennington admonished, ''like you're having a conversation.''</p>
        <p>As I turned away to throw a few warm-up passes, I spotted the team owner Woody Johnson standing nearby in a blazer, tie and green Jets cap. I glimpsed the head coach Eric Mangini hunkering on the far sideline in a black jumpsuit. Then the rap music stopped. I heard Brian calling my name, and I bolted out onto the field.</p>
        <p>The instant I joined the gaggle of white jerseys in the huddle, I felt like I was going to throw up. I didn't recognize the other players on either side of the ball. There was no Justin Miller to blitz me, but there was no Pete Kendall to block, no Laveranues Coles to catch. The center wasn't Nick Mangold, but a No. 71 whom I'd never met, much less taken snaps from.</p>
        <p>''You gotta take control,'' I whispered to myself, ''just like Chad.''</p>
        <p>I put my hands on my knees and sucked a deep breath. All I could see was dirt and the battered shins of 10 enormous men. All I could hear was Brian's voice crackling in my headset, reminding me to call the draw play I'd learned that morning.</p>
        <p>''Jack Right Close 20 Mike,'' I said, stuttering. ''Second sound, second sound.''</p>
        <p>My offensive unit broke out of the huddle, and I followed No. 71 up to the line of scrimmage. The defensive unit was already heckling me.</p>
        <p>''Come on Number Zero,'' one of them shouted. ''Let's get it on.''</p>
        <p>''This is bye week,'' growled another. ''We're ready for vacation.''</p>
        <p>I put my hands under No. 71's butt. His jersey was soaked, and perspiration was raining down on his pants.</p>
        <p>''Set!'' I shouted at the top of my lungs. ''Hut!''</p>
        <p>To my amazement, I took the snap without fumbling or tripping. I backpedaled a few steps, and stuck the ball into the onrushing gut of the tailback, who turned out to be Leon Washington, a 5-foot-8, 202-pound rookie. I kept rolling out to my right, ''finishing'' the play without the ball as I'd seen Chad do on television. Then I glanced back, and saw Leon plunge forward for a five-yard gain.</p>
        <p>I felt a joyous adrenaline rush. With that one successful handoff I'd bested Plimpton, who had fumbled repeatedly and lost a total of 29 yards on the five plays he ran with the Detroit Lions. But Leon returned to the huddle rubbing his belly in pain.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to jam it in there so hard, man,'' he complained.</p>
        <p>I nodded, muttering an apology. Then I called my first pass play, trying to keep my overexcited voice at the conversational level Chad had recommended.</p>
        <p>''Double Right Gone Right 444 H Swing Flat,'' I hissed.</p>
        <p>I took the snap O.K. and dropped back five steps. My primary receiver was a tight end button-hooking over the middle. But the linemen in front of me were so tall, I lost sight of him. I heaved the ball downfield as hard as I could. It barely missed the helmet of one of the opposing linebackers, and fell harmlessly to the turf.</p>
        <p>''Get 'em in the huddle,'' Coach Mangini shouted from behind me.</p>
        <p>I sensed that the other players were growing increasingly impatient, but this third play was likely to be the final one of my N.F.L. career. As I re-entered the huddle, I silently vowed to stay in the moment as long as it lasted.</p>
        <p>''Flank Right Quick Ace Right 321 F Flat,'' I wheezed.</p>
        <p>The huddle broke before I could call the snap cadence, but I figured just about everyone in Nassau County knew it was going to be on the second sound. As I sidled up to the center, I heard Brian's voice crackling in my headset.</p>
        <p>''Corner's laying off,'' he said. ''Go to the Big Alert.''</p>
        <p>Translated from the Jets playbook jargon, that was the next thing to an audible. My primary receiver on the play was the fullback drifting out in the flat on the right side. But if the opposing cornerback positioned himself more than a few yards back of the line of scrimmage, I was supposed to go to my left side wide-out, a k a the Big Alert.</p>
        <p>A split second later, I took the snap, whirled to my left, and chucked the ball toward a receiver who turned out to be Justin McCareins, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound speedster. The ball seemed to waffle in the air like a wounded duck. But somehow Justin made the grab. He raced upfield for a putative first down. I ran after him, waving a finger in the air like I was Joe Willie Namath winning Super Bowl III.</p>
        <p>The four minutes that followed were an unforgettable blur. Leon leaped up and gave me a congratulatory chest butt that almost knocked me to the ground. One of the coaches called for me to ''break it down'' with my offensive unit by leading a cheer. We gathered in a circle, and stacked hands. But I had no idea what to do next. After a couple of false starts, I finally managed, ''1-2-3 Go Jets!''</p>
        <p>Brian beckoned me to break it down with Chad and his backups, Patrick Ramsey and Kellen Clemens, as if they were accepting me as one of their own. At Chad's suggestion, I hollered, ''1-2-3 QBs!'' After we split, I overheard him say: ''One for two's not bad. I'm proud of him. He handled it well.''</p>
        <p>Coach Mangini sauntered over. I was so elated, I asked if he'd sign me to a contract. He smiled sympathetically, then poured a bit of bitter over all the sweet. ''It doesn't look good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I pumped his hand anyway, and said I'd talk to Woody.</p>
        <p>I finally came back to earth 48 hours later when I watched a DVD of my performance with my 9-year-old son, Harrison. A soccer player destined to become a Nobel Prize-winning artist, entrepreneur and brain surgeon, Harrison insisted that trick-or-treating as father and son werewolves on Halloween was much scarier than quarterbacking the Jets in an intra-squad scrimmage.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a realgame, Dad,'' he noted. ''But if you ever do get to play in a real game, you should wear that red jersey.''</p>
