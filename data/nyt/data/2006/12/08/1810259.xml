      <block class="full_text">
        <p>State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, who faces the threat of removal from office for using state workers to chauffeur his wife, has told associates that he intends to fight to serve out the term he was re-elected to last month, according to more than a half-dozen elected officials and others who have spoken with him in the past month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, has told colleagues that he was re-elected by a wide margin by people who knew about the chauffeur scandal, and voted for him anyway, and that he does not believe that one ''mistake'' should wipe out a long career in public service, said the officials, who were granted anonymity because they did not want to be seen as breaking confidence by discussing their private conversations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi has spent at least $750,000 in campaign funds on lawyers representing him before those who have been investigating him, including the State Ethics Commission, the state attorney general's office, a special counsel appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki and the Albany County district attorney's office, which is conducting a criminal inquiry, according to campaign finance filings released on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, a fellow Democrat, will almost certainly ask the Republican-controlled State Senate to consider removing Mr. Hevesi from office after the new term begins in January, people involved in the discussions have said. But if some Democrats have privately been hoping that Mr. Hevesi would step down quietly to spare the party a divisive and potentially distracting battle that could eat into Mr. Spitzer's honeymoon period, Mr. Hevesi is sending signs that they may be disappointed.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure he believes that because he's won, he's going to fight this,'' said one elected official who recently spoke with Mr. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>During the recent comptroller's race, Republicans accused Democrats of rallying to re-elect Mr. Hevesi only so they could name his successor. If Mr. Hevesi resigns, the Democratic-led Assembly can choose someone to serve out his term, while if he is removed from office, the governor will select his successor. Several Democrats who endorsed Mr. Hevesi basically acknowledged as much, saying that they were voting for him to keep the comptroller a Democrat, who might or might not be Mr. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>Since then, elected officials here in Albany have been buzzing among themselves about possible replacements, with new names surfacing almost daily.</p>
        <p>The Hevesi camp, though, worked hard to win re-election, and has sent strong signals that it is still in battle mode. Mr. Hevesi spent $4.8 million in the last weeks of the election, leaving his once giant campaign account with a balance of $119,000, the most recent campaign filing shows. And on election night, Mr. Hevesi announced, ''I intend to serve and work hard for the people of New York every day of my next four years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi continued to raise money until the end, including receiving money from some firms that earn fees for handling investments for the state pension funds, which Mr. Hevesi oversees as the sole trustee. His aides said that these donations do not influence where Mr. Hevesi invests pension fund money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi's use of those campaign funds to pay for his lawyers is a legal, but questionable, use of campaign funds, campaign finance experts have said. In tapping his campaign donors to pay his legal fees, Mr. Hevesi joins a growing group of his colleagues in Albany. They include Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who used campaign funds to pay for lawyers to represent him when the state's lobbying commission investigated his stay at a discounted suite in Las Vegas, and former State Senator Guy J. Velella, who used campaign funds to pay the lawyers who represented him in a bribery case. Mr. Velella later pleaded guilty and resigned from office.</p>
        <p>A State Board of Elections opinion from 1989 holds that politicians can use campaign funds to pay for lawyers if the investigation is ''related to the political campaign or to the holding of public office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi has so far repaid the state more than $172,000 for using state workers to chauffeur his wife after the state police told his office that there did not appear to be a security threat to her to justify additional state-financed protection.</p>
        <p>Some allies of Mr. Hevesi observe that his stay-and-fight posture could change if he is indicted by the Albany County district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>If it does come to a removal hearing in the Senate, Mr. Hevesi could have a tough fight. Several state senators -- who would ultimately judge him -- have already called on him to resign, or have expressed concern about his behavior.</p>
        <p>But the matter might not end even if they vote to remove him. David N. Kelley, the former federal prosecutor appointed by Governor Pataki to review the case, said in an interview before the election that such a removal could be challenged in court, under the argument that he had essentially been forgiven by the electorate.</p>
