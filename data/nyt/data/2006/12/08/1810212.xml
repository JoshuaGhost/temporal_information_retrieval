        <p>BY the time the last brittle leaves drift to the forest floor in the Canaan Valley, most residents of the tiny West Virginia mountain towns of Thomas and Davis are obsessing over one thing: snow.</p>
        <p>The question, though, is not whether it will snow, or even how much -- but rather when it will fall in earnest. By mid-November, a ''spitting'' of snow, as residents in the valley's two towns call it, has usually settled in the cracks of sidewalks, only to melt off by noon. Then, late in the month, the snow-making machines crank up.</p>
        <p>At ski areas like White Grass in Davis, bonfires and Appalachian picking music heralded the opening of the season last weekend. So far, there have been light dustings of snow, and temperatures in the 20s at night.</p>
        <p>On average, 150 inches of snow, coming off the Great Lakes on northwesterly winds from Canada, blanket the region, which is less than 200 miles west of Washington.</p>
        <p>Most of those who don't ski the steep slopes of the Canaan (pronounced kah-NANE) Valley put on cross-country skis or strap on snowshoes to move through the woods and to revel in spectacular views. A growing number of geocachers have also discovered the backwoods of the valley in Tucker County. Treasure hunters of sorts, they use G.P.S. coordinates posted on the Internet to find hidden caches.</p>
        <p>Because the region -- which at an average elevation of 3,200 feet is one of the highest mountain valleys east of the Rockies -- offers a range of outdoor activities and is convenient to much of the East Coast, it has attracted families like Dr. Jim Vaughan and his three adult sons, who originally considered buying a second home in Vail, Colo.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vaughan, a physician, and one son, Jim Jr., a jazz musician, live in Elmira, N.Y., and the other sons, Tim and P. J., live in Arlington, Va., working as salesmen for information technology firms. Three of them are downhill skiers, and P. J. is a geocacher.</p>
        <p>''From a number of perspectives, including accessibility and the different kinds of things we're interested in, West Virginia makes a lot more sense for us,'' Dr. Vaughan said, ''especially since we plan to spend time here in all four seasons.''</p>
        <p>In the coldest months, outdoor pursuits include ice skating, snow tubing and sledding, in addition to skiing and snowshoeing. In spring, summer and fall (and sometimes in the snow), it's mountain biking, spelunking and horseback riding. Kayaking, golfing and trout fishing are also popular.</p>
        <p>Winter or summer, the lack of ambient light in the sparsely populated region makes the valley ideal for stargazers.</p>
        <p>The Scene</p>
        <p>In all seasons, the Canaan Valley lures visitors who prefer to spend their time outdoors and, not surprisingly, the scene both day and night is decidedly casual. At the Purple Fiddle, a popular night spot in Thomas, an old coal-mining town, where the beer arrives in Mason jars and the country music is live, the unspoken dress code calls for jeans, casual tops and maybe a cowboy hat for the daring.</p>
        <p>At the Canaan Valley Resort and Conference Center, several miles south of Davis, Dr. Frederick Reichle, the owner, described the atmosphere in the lodge after a day on the slopes as family oriented and relaxed.</p>
        <p>''Don't expect to see a $1,000 ski suit around here,'' said Dr. Reichle, who is also a physician in Philadelphia. ''That's not what we're about.''</p>
        <p>While the valley attracts mostly skiers and hikers, not everyone focuses solely on the outdoors. For John and Titi Ferguson, a draw is the active local arts community. A major feature is the 3,000-square-foot MountainMade Artist Gallery in Thomas, which features the works of more than 200 West Virginia artists, including handcrafted furniture and hand-blown glass.</p>
        <p>Former residents of Washington, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson -- he designs stained-glass art objects and she paints watercolors -- bought their rambling three-bedroom ski lodge in Davis 17 years ago and have since retired there.</p>
        <p>''At first, we went to Canada for reliable snow conditions, but we couldn't always get away for a long time, so we started coming to the Canaan Valley, which was more convenient,'' said Mr. Ferguson, who formerly worked in medical publishing. ''And then we discovered this other big plus about living here.''</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <p>The Canaan Valley is expected to become a more accessible getaway from the Washington area in the next few years. When the oft-delayed Corridor H, a four-lane federal highway being built, is finally completed (still a few years away), the trip from northern Virginia, Maryland and Washington, where many owners of second homes in Tucker and Davis live full time, will be reduced to 2 hours and 45 minutes from the current three and a half hours. Corridor H, which begins in Wardensville, W.Va., will eventually end 110 miles farther west, in Elkins, after looping through Davis.</p>
        <p>But no matter how popular or accessible it becomes, there is a built-in limit on how densely populated the Canaan Valley can become. Sixty percent of the land is either state or federally owned and cannot be developed, said William Smith, executive director of the regional chamber of commerce, leaving about 5,000 acres of private land in the valley that either has been developed or can be developed.</p>
        <p>The valley includes the 10,215-acre federal Dolly Sods Wilderness Area, which has steep, rocky trails for expert hikers, and Canaan Mountain Backcountry, a plateau of about 13,532 acres that takes in Blackwater Falls State Park. And sections of the federally owned 919,000-acre Monongahela National Forest are in Tucker County.</p>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <p>Those seeking of-the-moment restaurants and glitzy entertainment should look elsewhere. The ''downtowns'' of Davis and Thomas include no more than one or two main streets, with a smattering of stores and restaurants. Both towns bear a striking resemblance to a Western-movie set.</p>
        <p>By the way, there is one traffic light in all Tucker County, in Parsons, the county seat, west of Davis.</p>
        <p>The Real Estate Market</p>
        <p>Many people buying second homes in Davis and Thomas are from the Philadelphia area as well as from around Washington, according to Amy Fiorini, a sales agent for Timberline Resort Realty in Canaan Valley. They tend to be investors, lawyers or business executives.</p>
        <p>''My customers tend to be young, family-oriented, athletic families who want to play hard during the day,'' she said, ''and then spend their evenings by the fireplace with a bowl of popcorn and a Scrabble board.''</p>
        <p>Laura Reed, who owns Canaan Realty with her husband, Cary W. Reed, said the lack of municipal sewers in some places also limits intense development, forcing lots to be large enough to accommodate septic fields.</p>
        <p>For $335,000, home buyers can find a three-bedroom, three-bath ski house with a hot tub within five miles of a ski area. For $550,000, there are four-bedroom houses on two to five acres within walking distanceof the slopes.</p>
        <p>Single-family houses line the trails at one of the area's major downhill ski areas, Timberline Ski Resort. A 5,000-square-foot slope-side home on a quarter-acre lot sold for $975,000 this summer.</p>
        <p>Not all home buyers, however, opt to be near the lifts. David Platt, a stockbroker from Takoma Park, Md., and his wife, Michelle Smith, a social worker and therapist, bought a three-bedroom Victorian in Thomas last year for $90,000 and are spending another $100,000 to fix it up. Even though they both ski downhill, they wanted their getaway to be in a town.</p>
        <p>''We like being able to walk to the shops, even though there's just a few of them,'' Ms. Smith said. ''Thomas is a very little town.''</p>
        <p>LAY OF THE LAND</p>
        <p>POPULATION -- 577 people lived in Davis last year, according to an estimate by the federal census, and 411 in Thomas. In Tucker County (www.canaanvalley.org), which governs the Canaan Valley, an unincorporated area directly south of Davis, the population was estimated at 6,943.</p>
        <p>SIZE -- Davis covers 1.1 square miles, Thomas 0.6. Canaan Valley encompasses an estimated 32 square miles, most of which is federal or state park land, according to the Tucker County Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
        <p>LOCATION -- Davis and Thomas are less than 200 miles west of Washington, and about 300 miles southwest of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>WHO'S BUYING -- Professionals from metropolitan Washington and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>GETTING THERE -- From the Washington area, take I-270 north to I-70 west to I-68 west near Hancock, Md. Follow I-68 west to Cumberland, Md., then Route 220 south through Keyser, W.Va., until it intersects with Route 50 west near New Creek, W.Va. Take Route 50 west a short distance until it connects with Route 93 west. Follow Route 93 west to Davis.</p>
        <p>Or take I-70 west to I-68 west to Route 219 south. In West Virginia, pick up Route 32 and drive south to Thomas and Davis. Route 32 goes south into the Canaan Valley.</p>
