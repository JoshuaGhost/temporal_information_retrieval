        <p>The Giants are in a precarious position, balanced on an ever-thinning tightrope, hovering between contention and collapse.</p>
        <p>Four consecutive losses have greatly dimmed their outlook but not fully blackened their prospects. In the bottom-heavy National Football Conference, the Giants (6-6) are still positioned as a playoff team.</p>
        <p>But the season is already classified as disappointing, and nothing except a deep playoff run will change that. Talk radio, fan bulletin boards on the Internet and newspapers have compiled lists of preferred replacements for Coach Tom Coughlin, including the former Giants coach Bill Parcells, Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis, and even Rutgers Coach Greg Schiano.</p>
        <p>For the moment, however, the winds of change blow only outside of Giants Stadium, and not through its corridors. In a strange way, the latest loss -- a 23-20 defeat against the Dallas Cowboys, decided on a last-second field goal Sunday -- brought a fresh calm.</p>
        <p>The Giants are running out of chances to recover, but they were oddly buoyed by the game against the Cowboys. They played well for the first time in three weeks, and they blamed their habit of flubbed plays, something they believe is entirely correctable, for the loss.</p>
        <p>''The mood is good,'' receiver Plaxico Burress said. ''It's not games that we were outright getting beat and just losing. We're giving teams early Christmas presents. We're giving games away.''</p>
        <p>Whether the off-season brings tinkering or an overhaul will depend on the next four games. Any changes do not appear to have been decided already.</p>
        <p>Linebacker LaVar Arrington knows change. He spent the past six seasons with the Washington Redskins and played for five head coaches. Now on injured reserve for the Giants, rehabilitating the surgically repaired Achilles' tendon that he tore in October, Arrington has a unique perspective: part player, part observer.</p>
        <p>He said he could sense the changes in Washington before they came. He does not have that feeling now.</p>
        <p>''It's different,'' Arrington said. ''It's not an unstable atmosphere here. It's funny, because, for as much as is written and is said about what goes on in this locker room, there's a level of normality that is maintained. And I think it's a thing with the front office. They aren't so intrusive. You get the sense that it will get better. They'll figure it out. I don't get the feeling I got in Washington, where it's like a graveyard.''</p>
        <p>Punter Jeff Feagles has played for five franchises in 19 seasons. He joined the Giants in 2003, when they started 4-4 and then lost their final eight games under Jim Fassel, who was fired and replaced by Coughlin. Feagles said he felt the overhaul coming then.</p>
        <p>Asked if he sensed it now, he said: ''No, I don't. I really don't.''</p>
        <p>Giants management is predictably muffled on the possibility of changes, no matter how loud the voices grow at the stadium doors.</p>
        <p>John Mara, whose family owns half the team and who runs the day-to-day operation, declined a request Monday to discuss the team.</p>
        <p>General Manager Ernie Accorsi is retiring at the end of the season, and his replacement has not been named. He has recommended to Mara that his job go to the team's director for player personnel, Jerry Reese, but the Giants are expected to put off that decision until season's end.</p>
        <p>Coughlin has a steely focus that reflexively does not allow him to publicly discuss anything beyond the next game, and sometimes past the next practice. His assistants are not permitted to talk to members of the news media except on a few predetermined dates; the next one is scheduled for about six months from now.</p>
        <p>It would seem, barring a championship, that some changes are imminent. A collapse could cost Coughlin his job with a year left on his contract; otherwise, the Giants will probably add a year to his deal in the off-season, to show some semblance of faith in his future.</p>
        <p>Blame tends to flow downhill, however, so changes could come among the assistants. The defense, coordinated by Tim Lewis and besieged by injuries recently, was ranked 16th in the 32-team N.F.L. in yards allowed and 19th in points allowed before Monday night's game.</p>
        <p>Offensively, the Giants averaged 27.2 points in their first six games, but 17.0 points in their past six, and the growth curve of the third-year quarterback Eli Manning seemed to reach a dead end.</p>
        <p>In a quiet and mostly empty locker room Monday, Manning and Burress were two of the players coming to the defense of the offensive coordinator, John Hufnagel.</p>
        <p>''He has a good plan,'' said Manning, who followed three poor performances with one of his best games against Dallas. ''He understands what I like and what I don't. He listens to me. We have a good relationship, and I think he's calling good plays.''</p>
        <p>The players continue to play hard for Coughlin, and with the playoffs a possibility, there are few signs of an insurrection.</p>
        <p>Arrington was asked if Coughlin or his assistants were in danger of being tuned out.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' he said. ''I know growing up, my mother and father, if they were reprimanding me and they screamed at me too much or spanked me too much, at some point -- you know where I'm going. I don't know. I'm interested to see, too.''</p>
        <p>So it was telling that Coughlin admitted Monday to a kinder approach with players.</p>
        <p>''I've been, I think, more encouraging in some of these losses of late because I know how down they are,'' Coughlin said Monday.</p>
        <p>The Giants have room to fall further. They also have a chance to make that Super Bowl run that they long expected. There are four games left, and the tightrope is thinning.</p>
