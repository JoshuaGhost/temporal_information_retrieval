        <p>Jets Coach Eric Mangini was asked a couple of trick questions yesterday. Fresh from his team's most dominating performance of the season, did Mangini think the Jets had emerged as the No. 1 team in the American Football Conference?</p>

        <p>Jets Coach Eric Mangini was asked a couple of trick questions yesterday. Fresh from his team's most dominating performance of the season, did Mangini think the Jets had emerged as the No. 1 team in the American Football Conference?</p>
        <p>''We're trying to be the No. 1 team in Hempstead,'' Mangini said.</p>
        <p>Did Mangini feel he was the toast of the town? Mangini, the 35-year-old-rookie coach, laughed but wisely sidestepped that trap question as well.</p>
        <p>A lopsided victory against the hapless Green Bay Packers -- whose free-flinging, over-the-hill quarterback, Brett Favre, doesn't know he's over the hill -- is hardly grounds for being the toast of the town.</p>
        <p>''I feel like it's really any other week,'' Mangini said. ''It's been pretty consistent here. Nothing much has changed.''</p>
        <p>Many players and coaches come to New York and start to buy into a news media-created image that often has no basis. The only reality that matters in the business of pro football is winning.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the real toast of the town was addressing another flock of news media 40 miles away inside Giants Stadium. Tom Coughlin, the beleaguered coach of the Giants, faced another firing squad after a fourth consecutive loss. Coughlin is being toasted and roasted all over town. While the Jets are 7-5 and rising, the Giants are a middling 6-6 and perhaps two losses away from missing the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Mangini and Coughlin are fascinating studies: a young coach having no image to live up to and a veteran coach boxed in by an image. Mangini's young Jets are winning with grit and composure; Coughlin's veteran Giants are losing. Actually, the Giants are losing and are in disarray, a trait that has defined the team but is supposedly so un-Coughlin.</p>
        <p>Coughlin was a law-and-order coach, an image the news media has instinctively encouraged. Coughlin bought into it.</p>
        <p>To make his point about discipline early on, Coughlin indulged in silly maneuvers like fining players for not being five minutes early for team meetings, ostensibly to set the tone for discipline.</p>
        <p>He set the tone for mutiny.</p>
        <p>He preached discipline and composure, but through their four-game losing streak, the Giants -- and Coughlin -- have been anything but poised. The lasting image of the Coughlin regime may well be him flailing his arms, screaming and tearing down the sideline after Mathias Kiwanuka, a rookie defensive lineman who gave up on a sack of quarterback Vince Young during a last-minute loss to Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Coughlin told his team yesterday that it had to play smarter.</p>
        <p>''We're beating ourselves,'' he said. ''We're hurting ourselves, and the fact of the matter is, the games are slipping away from our grasp by what's happening right in front of us on the field.''</p>
        <p>The perception of Coughlin's Giants is that they are an undisciplined team coach by an authoritarian.</p>
        <p>If the coach doesn't listen, the next words he hears will be the echo of goodbye.</p>
        <p>''We need to win a football game,'' Coughlin said. ''We're going to stick together and find a way to win. That's what we're going to do.''</p>
        <p>He'd better, or these may well be the last four games of his tenure. The coach who chooses to stay the course invites disaster.</p>
        <p>Veteran players know a fake when they see one; young players are too new and desperate to care.</p>
        <p>Coughlin wraps himself in that image so tightly that it has begun to choke the life out of his team -- and his coaching career. After four consecutive losses, Coughlin should be listening.</p>
        <p>Mangini, on the other hand, has been the stoical sideline presence, never too up, too low.</p>
        <p>''We're excited about the progress we're making and there's still a quarter of the season left,'' Mangini said.</p>
        <p>Coaches and players either buy or sell the image the news media create for them: the tough guy, the comedian, the clown, the hero. The only foundation is winning.</p>
        <p>Mangini is fortunate not to have a persona to live up to: He's not the General (Coughlin), not the Tuna (Bill Parcells), not the Sphinx (Bill Belichick). He is a rookie coach trying to put together a winning season in his rookie year.</p>
        <p>Mangini made an observation about the fragility of image, of toasts of the town.</p>
        <p>''I appreciate the excitement, I appreciate the fans' excitement, and I think that's great,'' he said. ''But if we lose track of the next game and get caught up in the other things that are happening, then that's when you let a game slip away and it really won't matter what happens outside of this building, if we're not continually focused on the task at hand.''</p>
        <p>Who knows how these next four weeks will turn out. The Jets could disintegrate and lose all four games and miss the playoffs. The veteran Giants could win the next four and win the division.</p>
        <p>In a city where deep divisions of loyalty are expressed by rooting interests, the Jets, for now, have won the battle of the water cooler.</p>
