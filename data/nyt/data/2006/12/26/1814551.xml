        <p>If you order a beer in Bennington, Vt., this week, chances are that a subtle warning from the police will come with your Pilsner.</p>
        <p>The Bennington Police Department has distributed to local bars and restaurants 200 pint glasses bearing three of its logos.</p>
        <p>''It's about alcohol awareness, trying to get people to drink responsibly and not drink and drive,'' said Lt. Paul Doucette of the department. ''When they see the police logo, maybe they'll stop and think.''</p>
        <p>The police handed out the glasses, which were donated by a local glass company, to seven bars and restaurants in Bennington, a town of 15,000 in western Vermont. Lieutenant Doucette said that the glasses were becoming a novelty in town, and that other police departments were calling to replicate the program.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately some of them will disappear because people do collect pint glasses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>T. J. Carmody, owner of Carmody's Pub, got about four cases of the glasses last Tuesday. He said customers were coming in and requesting the glasses, which are being rotated between the dining room and bar, so nondrinkers can also use a glass.</p>
        <p>''We don't want people not to drink, but we want them to be aware that they can't drink and drive,'' Mr. Carmody said.</p>
        <p>Mark Krause, 47, was drinking a Smithwick's out of a Bennington police glass on Friday afternoon at Carmody's. Mr. Krause said in a phone interview that he had waited to drink from a police glass.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a great idea,'' he said. ''If you're sitting at the bar and you're having a cocktail, most people spin the glass around to see the logo. This one makes that light bulb go off and you think about drinking and driving.''</p>
