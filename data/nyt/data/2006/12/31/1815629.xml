        <p>Familiar Initials</p>
        <p>The week's most interesting game should be Tuesday when the Sixers play the Nuggets and Allen Iverson gets a chance to take on his former teammates.</p>
        <p>The Sixers are without Iverson, but another A.I. will be leading them into Denver.</p>
        <p>Andre Iguodala has led Philadelphia in scoring in four of its five games since the trade, and he is averaging 20 points a game.</p>
        <p>Iverson has been even better than usual, averaging 31.3 points and 11 assists a game since the trade. The Nuggets lost his first game, but won the next two.</p>
        <p>Two Birds, One Ankle</p>
        <p>When the Hornets star CHRIS PAUL, above, went down to injury, the team lost not only its game-changing point guard, but also its top scorer.</p>
        <p>Paul, a second-year player, had led the team to a disappointing but competitive 11-17 record by averaging 18.4 points, a team high, and 9 assists a game. With Paul and forward Peja Stojakovic out, the Hornets are not likely to get back into contention.</p>
        <p>The Rockets are going through a similar problem since the loss of Yao Ming, their leading scorer and rebounder, who is out at least six weeks. The Rockets split their two games since Yao's injury.</p>
        <p>What Did He Do Lately?</p>
        <p>When the Grizzlies cut ties with Coach Mike Fratello last week, they gave up a large part of the team's history with winning.</p>
        <p>Success has been hard to come by for this franchise. During the team's time in Vancouver, its record was 101-357. When the Grizzlies moved to Memphis, they went 106-144 before Fratello replaced Hubie Brown.</p>
        <p>Fratello was 89-59 over the past two seasons, leading the team to the playoffs twice. But the Grizzlies' 6-24 start in the absence of the star forward Pau Gasol spelled the end for Fratello.</p>
        <p>Nothing but Net</p>
        <p>Basketball is played in more places than the arenas of the N.B.A. The Web site hoopshype.com manages to weave together tales of Rucker Park and other offbeat basketball destinations with speculation and news about the N.B.A. Some features on the site include an interview with World B. Free and a profile of Ricardo Ely, whom the site calls one of the greatest prison basketball players ever.</p>
