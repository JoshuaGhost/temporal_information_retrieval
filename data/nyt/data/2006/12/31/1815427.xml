        <p>THE gunmen fired on a busy street on a spring afternoon. The rapist attacked a mother in a hotel parking lot, her children just steps away.</p>
        <p>Arrests in the two cases came quickly, with much credit going to silent witnesses -- private surveillance cameras that caught the suspects on tape.</p>
        <p>Citing such successes, Stamford is considering a proposal to put its own cameras on public streets. Residents and politicians now have to decide how much, if any, privacy to surrender in the name of safety, and whether singling out certain neighborhoods for scrutiny is a high-tech form of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>To some, the plan took on new urgency with federal data released this month showing that, while the city is safe relative to other towns of its size, it experienced a 10 percent increase in violent crime in the first half of 2006.</p>
        <p>The proposal would place several mobile and fixed cameras in high-crime areas and other trouble spots, like dumping grounds for mattresses and other junk. Preliminary plans call for a mix of real-time monitoring of some areas and tape recordings of others.</p>
        <p>The city now has more than a dozen cameras on the streets, but monitoring traffic is the only authorized use. Should the proposal for new cameras pass, officials say, the initial budget request will be for $100,000.</p>
        <p>Cities and towns across the country and in Connecticut -- from San Francisco to New York City and from Hartford to West Haven -- have used cameras for law enforcement. Avon, west of Hartford, is considering a proposal to install cameras to catch speeders.</p>
        <p>Supporters argue that a camera, when properly installed and monitored, is no different from a police officer walking a neighborhood beat. The benefits, in deterring crimes and solving them, outweigh concerns over privacy and profiling, they argue.</p>
        <p>''I dispense with the notion of 'Big Brother-ism,' '' said the Rev. Tommie Jackson, the pastor of a large, predominantly black church downtown. Jackson said his congregants supported the use of cameras, even if they will be concentrated in largely minority neighborhoods. ''When a gun is stuck in my face and someone is going to rob me, I'm not concerned with the color of the person holding the gun,'' he said.</p>
        <p>William Callion, the city's director of public safety, said putting the cameras in targeted areas made the most sense. ''If I put a camera in the middle of Mianus River Gorge in the middle of North Stamford, where the deer and the antelope play, that would not be a very good use of taxpayer dollars,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At a public hearing this month, opponents like Patricia Kane, a resident and lawyer, argued that while cameras might help solve crimes, they were an unnecessary intrusion into the lives of law-abiding citizens. ''I would say that in legislation, as in medicine, first thing, do no harm,'' Ms. Kane said.</p>
        <p>The sophistication of the technology is cause for concern, said Robert McCrie, a professor of security management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. He said that technology still being developed could detect even minor nuances in behavior.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he said that, with few exceptions, communities that have used cameras have seen a drop in overall crime. With proper handling of the surveillance system, the safety benefit outweighs the privacy risk, he said.</p>
        <p>Capt. Richard Conklin, head of the city's detective bureau, said cameras were an essential crime-fighting tool. In the recent rape case, he said, investigators received a surveillance image of the suspect's car that was ''as good as if you were going to advertise it for sale.''</p>
        <p>But residents like Rolf Maurer, 44, who works at a theater in Stamford, said cameras were intrusive and merely a distraction from the policy and societal failures that result in shootouts and rapes.</p>
        <p>''None of this addresses why people commit crimes,'' he said.</p>
