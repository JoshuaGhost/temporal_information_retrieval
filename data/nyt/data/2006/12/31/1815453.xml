        <p>AFTER five years as Connecticut's third poet laureate, complete with heightening suspense (would she die in office like James Merrill and Leo Connellan, the state's last two?), Marilyn Nelson has survived.</p>
        <p>Even though poets do not get much publicity, Ms. Nelson managed to wield her influence from Storrs in the East to Waterbury in the West during her time in office, stretching the definition of poet laureate as she went.</p>
        <p>''James Merrill didn't do anything except be a famous poet, which is all right,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''Leo Connellan did a lot of readings and workshops in public schools.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nelson fulfilled a dream a few years back by opening Soul Mountain, a multicultural retreat for poets, in East Haddam.</p>
        <p>But now she needs an infusion of cash to keep it open, and she is hoping that the actor Paul Newman -- nothing like putting him on the spot -- will find it in his heart to donate a little money to a big cause.</p>
        <p>''I need him to say, 'I'm a believer in what you're doing,' '' she said in a voice that rarely rose above a whisper from her quarters at Soul Mountain. ''It's that or win the lottery.''</p>
        <p>During her term, Ms. Nelson managed to keep her sense of humor as she established herself as the most creatively active of the state's poet laureates. She wrote books of poetry based on Connecticut's history and a collection of sonnets produced in conjunction with Elizabeth Alexander, a poet and fellow at Yale University. She also wrote a poem about an African-American skeleton that is in Mattituck Museum's collection in Waterbury.</p>
        <p>The poem was published in book form; it will be set to music and is scheduled to be performed in March 2009 by the Waterbury Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>''For the most part, what I've done is give my writing life to Connecticut,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''It took some time for me to find my way of defining this position.''</p>
        <p>Early on, she also delivered books of poetry to doctors' offices and hospital waiting rooms throughout the state, which she said helped her become more appreciative of those who deliver goods for a living. It left her exhausted.</p>
        <p>''I called it waiting-room poetry,'' she said. ''But driving around like Santa Claus turned into a big chore.''</p>
        <p>She has stopped the deliveries, stopped writing exclusively about Connecticut's history and stopped being poet laureate. She will leave that to John Hollander, the Sterling professor emeritus of English at Yale, who will serve the state through 2011.</p>
        <p>But rest is not in her future.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nelson is continuing to seek financing for Soul Mountain, and she is returning to the University of Connecticut in January, where she will teach English for a semester. In exchange, the university will make a large donation to the retreat.</p>
        <p>As poet laureate, she said, she faced a learning curve. ''But I figured out what I could do with it,'' she said, ''and it's been very rewarding.''</p>
