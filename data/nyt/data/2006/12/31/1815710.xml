        <p>After nearly three decades of living with the brutal repression of Saddam Hussein and the violent aftermath of his overthrow by American troops, Iraq responded with a mixture of rejoicing, violence and muted reflection on Saturday to the news that their former dictator had been hanged in one of the grimmest of his own execution chambers.</p>
        <p>This nation of 27 million people spent much of the day crowding around television sets to watch mesmerizing replays of a videotape that showed the 69-year-old Mr. Hussein being led to the gallows at dawn by five masked executioners, and having a noose fashioned from a thick rope of yellow hemp lowered around his neck. In the final moments shown on the videotape, he seemed almost unnaturally calm and cooperative.</p>

        <p>After nearly three decades of living with the brutal repression of Saddam Hussein and the violent aftermath of his overthrow by American troops, Iraq responded with a mixture of rejoicing, violence and muted reflection on Saturday to the news that their former dictator had been hanged in one of the grimmest of his own execution chambers.</p>
        <p>This nation of 27 million people spent much of the day crowding around television sets to watch mesmerizing replays of a videotape that showed the 69-year-old Mr. Hussein being led to the gallows at dawn by five masked executioners, and having a noose fashioned from a thick rope of yellow hemp lowered around his neck. In the final moments shown on the videotape, he seemed almost unnaturally calm and cooperative.</p>
        <p>The message seemed to be that he had lived his final moments with unflinching dignity and courage, reinforcing the legend of himself as the Arab world's strongman that he cultivated while in power. But the videotape, released by the government, offered only a partial sense of how Mr. Hussein went to his death, according to accounts given later by some of the 25 people who attended the execution, including senior officials of the new Shiite-led government.</p>
        <p>In their telling, the ousted ruler, a Sunni, spent much of his last half-hour, after arriving at the execution block at the Khadimiyah prison in northern Baghdad, in querulous and at times irascible exchanges with the Shiite guards and executioners assigned to hang him and with some of the Shiite witnesses.</p>
        <p>His bitter defiance, in the last moments of his life, was focused on his old enemies: the United States, Iran and their ''spies,'' a word commonly used at the height of his tyranny to justify the merciless persecution of his domestic opponents.</p>
        <p>Early Sunday morning, an official in the governor's office in Salahaddin, Mr. Hussein's home province, said the former leader had been buried in Awia, near Tikrit, his hometown at 3:30 a.m. Also buried there are his two sons, Uday and Qusay, who were killed when American troops stormed their hideout in the northern city of Mosul in July 2003. But an Iraqi government official said earlier that the body would be kept hidden for the time being.</p>
        <p>The death sentence was to be carried out within 30 days of the rejection of his appeal, but the hanging was completed by the end of the fifth day, which took some officials in Washington by surprise and left some American legal officials, who have worked with the Iraqi court, uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>Within hours of the execution, at least 75 people were killed in nine bombing attacks of the kind that Sunni insurgents commonly carry out against Shiites. In the mainly Shiite districts of Hurriyah and Sayidah in Baghdad, separate sequences in which car bombs detonated in close succession caused at least 39 deaths. Two other car bombings hit Baghdad before nightfall, one outside a children's hospital in the Iskan neighborhood, and another that killed two people outside a mosque in the mainly Sunni district of Adhamiya, the Interior Ministry said.</p>
        <p>Another vehicle bomb detonated in a popular fish market in the Shiite holy town of Kufa, 100 miles south of Baghdad, killing 34 people and wounding 38 others, the ministry said. In the Kufa attack, an angry mob set on the suspected bomber and beat him to death, the police said. Five more victims died in a suicide bombing in the northern city of Tal Afar, another center of violence between Sunnis and Shiites.</p>
        <p>The United States military command announced six more combat deaths, bringing the number of American troops killed in December to 109, the deadliest month for American deaths since November 2004, according to Reuters.</p>
        <p>With bombing attacks a long-established feature of the struggle for power across Iraq, it was impossible to say whether the Saturday bombings were connected to the execution.</p>
        <p>But statements by remnants of the ousted Baath Party, the political vehicle Mr. Hussein rode to power, had promised retaliation, in the form of a new wave of bombings, if the death sentence passed by an Iraqi court eight weeks ago was carried out.</p>
        <p>American military commanders took the threat seriously enough to put troops in volatile areas on high alert. On Saturday, a statement on the party's Web site urged Iraqis to strike at the United States and Iran to avenge Mr. Hussein, but cautioned that they must avoid full civil war, Agence France-Presse reported.</p>
        <p>From accounts given by witnesses, the hanging had strong sectarian overtones. Within minutes of arriving at the execution block from the American detention center near the airport, where he spent more than 1,000 days in solitary confinement, Mr. Hussein, who may have been the only Sunni present, argued with the guards and executioners.</p>
        <p>The men who guided him to the gallows were drawn from the country's Shiite south, identifiable by their darker skins and accents. The Shiites of southern Iraq harbor a strong hatred for Mr. Hussein for his repression of uprisings there, a repression that killed tens of thousands of Shiites.</p>
        <p>The execution block scenes offered a grim echo of the sectarian struggle now convulsing Iraq, as Sunni insurgents and Shiite death squads engage in a implacable cycle of revenge that has killed as many as 3,700 civilians a month this year, and prompted many Iraqis to say that the killings ushered in by the overthrow of Mr. Hussein are becoming as brutal, and numerous, as anything he inflicted.</p>
        <p>Even the decision to hasten Mr. Hussein to the gallows took on a sectarian edge, as Iraq's new Shiite leaders presented the hanging as a message to Sunnis that their days as Iraq's rulers are gone forever.</p>
        <p>The message was clear in a statement issued by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, whose ''national unity'' government of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds has splintered into ethnic factions, with the Shiite religious groups that swept last December's elections increasingly assertive of their majority rights.</p>
        <p>The statement, which he signed before a battery of Iraqi television cameras, amounted to a warning to the Sunnis that their hopes of ever regaining power are lost. ''Saddam's execution puts an end to all their pathetic gambles on a return to dictatorship,'' he said, referring to the former Baathists at the core of the Sunni insurgency. ''I urge followers of the ousted regime to reconsider their stance, because the door is still open to anyone who has no innocent blood on his hands to help in rebuilding Iraq.''</p>
        <p>At his death, Mr. Hussein had ceased to be much of a major rallying point, even among diehard Sunnis, whose battles in the past three years have been less about restoring Mr. Hussein to power -- a chimerical goal, considering that the former leader was America's most closely-guarded prisoner in Iraq -- than about reversing the political transition from Sunni to Shiite rule.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maliki short-circuited a bitter internal debate within the government over how quickly to send Mr. Hussein to the gallows by signing an order for the execution on Friday night, voiding a procedure that would have required the three-man presidency council -- composed of a Kurd, a Sunni and Shiite -- to all vote for the hanging.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hussein and two of his associates were sentenced to death on Nov. 5 for their roles in the persecution of the Shiite town of Dujail, where an alleged assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein in 1982 was followed by the execution of 148 Shiite men and teenage boys. After the three men's convictions, Mr. Maliki led the push for a hanging before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>After the sentencing, American officials were confident that appeals might delay the hanging until the spring. But Mr. Maliki pressed for a speeded appeal process, and secured a confirmation of the death sentences within three weeks.</p>
        <p>A senior Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday that the Kurds had called for a delay, so the former Iraqi dictator could be prosecuted for crimes against them. But the official said there was no desire from the United States to seek a delay in the execution.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said President Bush had gone to sleep before Mr. Hussein's hanging, but had been told it was imminent. He awoke Saturday at 4:40 a.m. Central Time, said a White House spokesman, David Almacy, and at 5:55 a.m. received a 10-minute telephone briefing about the execution from his national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley. The president and Mr. Hadley discussed the execution and the worldwide reaction to it.</p>
        <p>''The president remarked that he was pleased with the culmination of the Iraqi judicial process, and justice was done,'' Mr. Almacy said.</p>
        <p>During the 1980s, the United States had supported Iraq under Mr. Hussein in its war with Iran.</p>
        <p>Among Shiites elsewhere in Iraq, there were sporadic eruptions of joy at the hanging, marked by dancing in the streets and the firing of automatic weapons into the air, as the early morning radio and television bulletins carried word that Mr. Hussein was dead. But the more general mood, even among Shiites, was one of subdued reflection, as if millions of Iraqis had exhausted their emotional and psychological reserves during the long years of violence.</p>
        <p>Apart from the bombings, the most palpable Sunni reaction to the hanging took the form of scattered protests, some of them violent, that swept through Tikrit, Mr. Hussein's hometown, and across Anbar Province, west of Baghdad, the principal heartland of the Sunni insurgency.</p>
        <p>In one major insurgent stronghold, Ramadi, American troops were reported to have fired in the air to scatter demonstrators, who were marching through the streets hoisting portraits of Mr. Hussein and firing automatic weapons into the air. In Falluja, 30 miles west of Baghdad, witnesses said crowds of angry men took to the streets within 90 minutes of the hanging, attacking a police station and a courthouse and setting them ablaze.</p>
        <p>Among those Iraqis who watched and re-watched the government's video of the hanging, there seemed to be a widespread view that Mr. Hussein accepted his fate, at the end, with a composure and courage at odds with the psychotic figure he cut during his 24 years in power. In that time, he ordered the killings of thousands of his fellow citizens, many of whom ended up in mass graves scattered across Iraq's oil-rich deserts.</p>
        <p>Throughout Saturday, Iraqi government officials put out conflicting signals as to what they planned to do with Mr. Hussein's body. An official in the governor's office in Salahaddin Province said that a delegation led by the governor, Hamad Shegata, and including and the head of Mr. Hussein's Albu-Nasir tribe, Sheikh Ali Al-Nida, had traveled to Baghdad during the day to arrange the handover of the body for burial in Awja. Muslim tradition requires that burials be completed before dusk on the day of death.</p>
        <p>But a political adviser to Prime Minister Maliki, Bassam al-Husseini, said there were no plans to hand over the body until the risk of violence over Mr. Hussein's hanging subsided, a period that he said could run for weeks or months.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he said, the body would be kept in ''a secret place,'' where it would be secure against desecration by his enemies. ''If we bury him in Tikrit, people will dig him up and tear the body apart,'' he said.</p>
