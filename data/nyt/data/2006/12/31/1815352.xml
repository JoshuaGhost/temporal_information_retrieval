        <p>ON the night of Sept. 19, military leaders in Thailand suspended the constitution, seized control of Bangkok and imposed martial law. Someone forgot to tell the lesbians.</p>
        <p>Several nights after the nonviolent coup, a crush of cheering women crowded around the stage at Shela, a lesbian nightclub near the city's major downtown park, Lumpini, where a popular singer, Palmy, was performing. Fans crammed the balcony, imported whiskey was flowing at every table and a lone tom, local slang for a butch lesbian, was dancing by herself behind the pool table.</p>
        <p>Coup or not, it was just another night out for Bangkok's puying rak puying, or women who love women.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, this scene would have been unthinkable. Lesbians either met each other at non-gay establishments or through word-of-mouth parties and restaurants. But thanks to the rapidly expanding Thai Internet, and a growing number of younger, more self-possessed lesbians, two nightclubs and several weekly parties catering exclusively to lesbians have opened in Bangkok in the past two years.</p>
        <p>The grandmother of lesbian parties is Lesla, held every Saturday at the Chit Chat Club, a hangar-sized beer hall in Bangkok's sprawling northern outskirts (Soi 85, Lad Phrao Road; 66-089-218-9119 or 66-2-618-7191 or 7192; www.lesla.com). If you show up after 11 p.m., you might find Munthana Adisayathepkul, the party's exuberant organizer, at the top of the balcony, throwing stuffed toys to the masses below. The hours are 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., with a 200-baht cover charge (less than $6 at 36 baht to the U.S. dollar) that gets you a bottle of Heineken.</p>
        <p>While Lesla is still going strong, smaller bars have opened in the more convenient downtown area. Shela (106 Lang Suan; 66-2-254-6463, www.shelacorner.com) is among the most popular, and its candlelit, modern d√©cor attracts a sophisticated 30s-and-over crowd. It's hours are 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., with no cover.</p>
        <p>Younger lesbians, meanwhile, are heading to Zeta (29 Royal City Avenue; 66-2-203-1043 or 1044; www.zetabangkok.com). It's at the slightly uncool end of Royal City Avenue, but don't tell that to the trendy 20-somethings who cram the smoke-filled room to split a bottle of whiskey and flirt. To keep things going, the house band, Mister Sister, plays Western and Thai pop music. Hours are 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., with no cover.</p>
        <p>The new lesbian scene isn't limited to bars and clubs. Zub Zip (674 Soi 101, Lad Phrao Road; 66-081-734-2759), an airy restaurant in northern Bangkok, opened in October and caters to older toms and dees, femme lesbians. The owner, Priyanan Bupa, greets visitors with a motherly smile, Chinese-Thai fusion food and, at least on a recent visit, fresh oranges. Two hundred baht will get you a heaping plate of Hong Kong noodles and a large bottle of Singha beer.</p>
        <p>And the party keeps growing. Numerous Web sites have popped up to help local lesbians and travelers stay current. Among the best is in English, the Lesbian Guide to Bangkok (www.bangkoklesbian.com). The Web site's creator, Caitlyn Webster, 27, arrived from New York City a year ago with her girlfriend, Jett Charnchoochai.</p>
        <p>''In New York, everyone has to be cool,'' Ms. Webster said. ''Here, they're just being cute.''</p>
