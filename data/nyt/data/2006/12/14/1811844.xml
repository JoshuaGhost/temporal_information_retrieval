      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Botswana's dwindling tribe of Bushmen won a crucial legal victory when the High Court ruled that the government had wrongly evicted the tribe from its diamond-rich ancestral lands in a stretch of Kalahari Desert that is now a state-protected game reserve larger than Switzerland. The judges ruled that the Bushmen legally occupied the land in 2002 when Botswana's government forced them out. The Bushmen claimed they were driven out to allow diamond mining. Government officials said it was trying to protect the reserve's animals from Bushmen hunters. The three-member judicial panel said the government had the right to cut off services, including water. But it acted illegally when it demolished tribal villages and trucked families of Bushmen to nearby settlements, the court said. About 2,000 Bushmen lived in the reserve when Botswana first began its forced relocations in 1997. It is not clear how many, if any, will return.</p>
