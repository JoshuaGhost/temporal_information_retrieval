        <p>TWO recent incidents of booing are the talk of the opera world, a hothouse of passionate debate if ever there was one. First, boos rained down on Plácido Domingo Dec. 5 for his conducting of ''La Bohème'' at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Then, more spectacularly, boos at Teatro alla Scala in Milan last Sunday caused the tenor Roberto Alagna to stomp off the stage, never to return, after his first aria in ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>Among the dedicated, much of the debate revolved around whether these performances justified the boos, not whether booing in general is acceptable. The overlooked assumption is that it is as much a part of opera tradition as ego-driven divas, wide girths and the curse of the chest cold. And that tradition is fairly singular. Ballerinas are rarely booed, after all, and theater audiences tend to show displeasure with the sounds of flapping seats and retreating footsteps. Tepid applause is about as bad as it gets in many classical instrumental concerts, although walking out during a contemporary piece is not unheard of. This was not always the case. The premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' in Paris in 1913 nearly caused a riot, shocking as the piece was then.</p>

        <p>Few would boo a ballerina. But opera fans put their passion in their pipes.</p>

The premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' in Paris in 1913 nearly caused a riot, shocking as the piece was then.</p>
        <p>Booing as a form of disapproval goes back at least to 1816, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, which says its origin is tied to the sound of oxen lowing. Certainly any stadium or sports arena can be filled with booing directed at underachieving athletes (see Knickerbockers, New York). In European soccer games, it's more likely to be whistles. Opera-house booing is more common in Europe, particularly at La Scala, than in the United States.</p>
        <p>More than most performing arts, opera approaches a sport. Will the tenor score that high C? How loud can that soprano sing? How long can she hold that note? Opera fans root for their favorites the way sports fans do. Opera also has the tradition of claques, or organized groups of supporters -- sometimes paid -- who cheer their favorites and denounce rivals. Opera fans also hear the same works over and over again, gaining intimate knowledge of a role and how it has been interpreted in the past.</p>
        <p>''It's possible some people consider opera as a blood sport,'' ventured David Hamilton, the opera historian and a retired critic.</p>
        <p>Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, points out that singers are easily identifiable, more so than instrumental soloists. As a young usher at the Met, he remembers claques tossing down confetti for their idols.</p>
        <p>''What is thrilling about opera is that it's a larger-than-life art form that is full of spectacle,'' Mr. Gelb said. ''There's a long tradition of audiences being volatile in their reactions, both positive and negative.'' He seemed ambivalent about what happened to Mr. Domingo, calling the booing ''disrespectful and inappropriate'' to a great artist. ''But it's an opera house and people have the right to do what they want to do, in the bounds of proper human conduct,'' he said, adding, ''We don't allow people to throw tomatoes.''</p>
        <p>His comments reflect how booing has long been a subject of contention in opera circles, as evinced by elaborate debate on electronic opera bulletin boards. One side argues that booing is in bad taste, cowardly, disruptive and hurts singers' feelings. Others say it is brave, upholds standards and is a matter of free expression, earned by the price of a ticket. Some contend that booing should be held to the end of the performance or reserved for production people.</p>
        <p>Maybe the tradition of booing at the opera has something to do with the human voice.</p>
        <p>''The tamed primal scream is the common language of the opera house,'' said Marc A. Scorca, the president of Opera America, a service organization. ''It's a vocal art form on both sides of the footlights.''</p>
        <p>And then there are the performers who boo back. When an audience at La Scala in 2000 booed Salvatore Licitra, another tenor, for omitting the traditional high C in ''Di Quella Pira'' -- a note that is not in the score -- the conductor Riccardo Muti turned to the audience.</p>
        <p>The opera house, the maestro said, is not a circus.</p>
