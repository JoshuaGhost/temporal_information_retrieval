        <p>''COMEDY,'' Steve Martin famously said, ''is not pretty.''</p>
        <p>That was never more in evidence than on Sunset Boulevard last week, where Paul Rodriguez, a comedian, was loudly debating a homeless pedestrian outside the Laugh Factory about a certain racial epithet.</p>
        <p>''Calling it 'the ''n'' word,' that's childish, Romper Room,'' said Mr. Rodriguez, bristling at the radio hosts, politicians and newly chastened comedians who have reduced the noxious epithet to its first letter when discussing it.</p>
        <p>''N-this, n-that, I don't care if you use it or not,'' shouted the passer-by, an African-American dressed in a hooded sweatshirt who declined to give his name but said he was 36 years old. ''This is about you and me getting the same bank loan as him,'' he said, while pointing at a white bystander. ''I want justice. I don't want to be sleeping on the street.''</p>
        <p>It was more than a week after the infamous Nov. 17 meltdown by Michael Richards during what was supposed to be a comedy act at the Laugh Factory. Mr. Richards, the former ''Seinfeld'' co-star, repeatedly shouted the epithet at a black heckler, and his tirade was caught on a video cellphone and quickly disseminated across the Internet.</p>
        <p>The impromptu and passionate street debate in front of the club last week seemed suddenly normal in Los Angeles, where most anywhere that comedians have gathered, a kind of town hall discussion has spontaneously broken out. From spotlighted stages to sidewalks, the comedy world is debating Mr. Richards's rant, even as the episode moves slowly to the periphery of the public's attention.</p>
        <p>Judy Carter, a teacher of stand-up comics, said she was discussing plans for the annual California Comedy Conference in Palm Springs this weekend with another comedian, Alex House, when they asked themselves how they might have responded in Mr. Richards's position. ''We did some soul-searching on it,'' Ms. Carter said. ''That's what comics are doing now. Would I do that? Have I done that? If I were pushed into a corner would I say something so horrible?''</p>
        <p>The answer was no, Ms. Carter said, and she was planning a workshop at the comedy conference called ''Don't Pull a Michael Richards.''</p>
        <p>''You never hit a heckler harder than they hit you,'' she said, explaining a basic rule of comedy.</p>
        <p>For many comics, the meaning of Mr. Richards's outburst is about more than bad comedy technique. Jamie Masada, the owner of the Laugh Factory, and Paul Mooney, a black comedian who used to write for Richard Pryor, have joined politicians and activists including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, in calling for an end to the use of what they call ''the 'n' word'' by everyone, including blacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mooney, who has used the word for years in his act, said Mr. Richards shocked him into realizing it had an ugly power that was no longer worth wielding.</p>
        <p>''I am a recovering 'n'-word-aholic,'' he said on Nov. 27 during a news conference at the Laugh Factory. Mr. Masada, concerned that his 28-year-old club would be branded as racist for merely being the site of Mr. Richards's tirade, announced a ban on the word. Henceforth any comic who uses it on stage will be barred for four to six months and possibly fined.</p>
        <p>But the Laugh Factory's ban is not sitting well with all comics, including the groundbreaking comedian Dick Gregory, who was set to perform with Mr. Mooney last night) at the Lincoln Theater in Washington.</p>
        <p>''Calling it 'the ''n'' word' is an insult,'' said Mr. Gregory, whose 1964 memoir was titled ''Nigger.'' ''It should be just as much an insult to Jews if they started changing concentration camp to 'the ''c'' word' and swastika to 'the ''s'' word.' You just destroyed history.''</p>
        <p>He will not be joining Mr. Mooney's boycott. ''I'm going to walk out on stage,'' Mr. Gregory, 75, said, ''and hand my book to a white woman in the front and say, 'Here, madam, take this ''Nigger'' to bed with you.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory and many others are asking why stop at just one word, if purifying the comedy discourse is the goal. Why stop at protecting one aggrieved group?</p>
        <p>In the lobby of the Laugh Factory after the news conference, Jason Stuart, a gay comedian, buttonholed Najee Ali, a civil rights activist, and said, ''Twenty-five percent of every black comic's act is gay-bashing and none of you have done anything about that.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Ali had shouldered his way to the microphones to tell the cameras that what Mr. Richards said showed that many white people harbor deep racism. In the lobby, he said he opposes the ban, and he responded to Mr. Stuart. ''It wasn't so much what he said,'' Mr. Ali said. ''We've heard the word used by many comedians. It was the rage, the hatred, the anger.''</p>
        <p>Calls to stamp out the epithet were the latest chapter in a contemporary debate over the word since its has become common, as a quasi-endearment, in the very public language of hip-hop. But in attempting to censor a word, activists seemed to be slightly shifting the conversation from whether Mr. Richards is a racist, to whether a given epithet is racist.</p>
        <p>Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of ''Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word,'' said that when he heard Mr. Mooney say he wanted to ''destroy'' the epithet, a few questions sprung to mind. ''Does that mean he wants the owners of record stores to throw out his comedy albums or Richard Pryor's 'That Nigger's Crazy'? '' Professor Kennedy said. ''What does he want done with my book? Does he want to cover them up?''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Richards's crack-up, on a Friday night, he shouted at a member of the audience, ''Shut up! Fifty years ago, we'd have you upside down,'' and he went on to unleash a stream of murderous vitriol. In an apology on ''The Late Show With David Letterman'' the following Monday, Mr. Richards tried to explain himself in part by saying: ''I work in a very uncontrolled manner onstage. I do a lot of free association.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Masada, the owner of the Laugh Factory, confirmed that Mr. Richards's act does indeed involve a lot of free association, adding, ''He gets rage from all the things he talks about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards, who appeared as Cosmo Kramer on ''Seinfeld'' for its nine seasons through 1998, had only recently ventured back into standup, Mr. Masada said. He did not want his name on the Laugh Factory marquee and for a time asked to be introduced as ''Zosa.'' ''He didn't want people coming to see Michael Richards or Kramer because he didn't think his act had been perfected enough,'' Mr. Masada said.</p>
        <p>At the club on the night before last Monday's news conference, a mostly African-American audience attended the long-running weekly show Chocolate Sundaes, mainly featuring black comedians. Mr. Richards was much on people's minds. Pookey Wigington , the executive producer, told the crowd that he and the host, Chris Spencer, had been getting ''hundreds and hundreds of e-mails and phone calls,'' and what was most important was ''how the Laugh Factory handled the situation.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, what about that?'' an audience member shouted.</p>
        <p>Another person called out, ''Why did they let him come back?''</p>
        <p>It was a reference to Mr. Richards's appearance at the club on Nov. 18, the night after his rant but before the video had spread across the Internet. Mr. Wigington said Mr. Richards had told the club he would apologize from the stage, and when hedid not he was asked to leave the club.</p>
        <p>It was not a humorous way to open a comedy night, but the Chocolate Sundaes crowd seemed satisfied. Every comedian who took the stage tried to spin at least one joke about Mr. Richards.</p>
        <p>''Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton don't do it for me,'' said Dannon Green, naming the two black leaders from whom Mr. Richards had sought counsel. ''The brother he should have called was Clinton. If he had called Clinton, I would have said 'O.K., he's all right.' ''</p>
        <p>That same night, there was a late show at the Improv nearby called ''Whiteboy Comedy.'' A larger-than-life poster of Mr. Richards was still hanging on the rear wall along with those featuring other comic luminaries like Chris Rock and Ray Romano. None of the comedians onstage made any reference to Mr. Richards.</p>
        <p>Four nights later, the Richards poster was gone. After serving as host of an 8 p.m. show, a benefit for a gay and lesbian center, the comedian Sarah Silverman said that she had not made a joke about Mr. Richards because she had not yet thought of a good one.</p>
        <p>The whole incident, she said, reminded her of Mel Gibson's drunken anti-Semitic tirade in Malibu earlier this year. In a good way. ''When I heard Mel Gibson had said that stuff, I was happy,'' Ms. Silverman said. ''Jews love real anti-Semitism because it's something you can point to to show it's real. It's not just gas in the air.''</p>
        <p>The best advice Ms. Silverman said she had heard for Mr. Richards was a reader comment on ESPN.com. It was suggested that Mr. Richards could redeem himself by going on a comedy stage and saying just two words with gusto: ''The Aristocrats!''</p>
        <p>That was the title of a documentary about a famously offensive joke that starts in a talent agent's office, digresses into raunchy improvisation and ends with the punch line ''The Aristocrats.'' The idea expressed in the film is that no matter how gross the improvisation, everything is excused by a punch line, even a meaningless one.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Richards is not seeking rehabilitation through comedy. On Friday he issued a statement through a spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, saying that he would apologize in person to the man he had attacked from the stage, Kyle Doss, at a meeting in the presence of a retired judge. Mr. Rubenstein said it was likely the two sides would discuss financial compensation.</p>
        <p>At a news conference later that day in Los Angeles, Mr. Doss, a 26-year-old student, and three other African-Americans who were with him at the Laugh Factory, appeared at the office of their lawyer, Gloria Allred. Ms. Allred said that characterizing her clients as hecklers, as most news accounts have done, is wrong because they were part of a large group celebrating a surprise birthday party, and what first drew Mr. Kramer's ire was the noise of them ordering drinks.</p>
        <p>For some, the most important lesson, one which may show some progress toward racial tolerance, is that it is the man who first hurled the racial insult who appears more damaged this time, not the target of his epithet. Mr. Gregory said his son told him a joke the other day: ''What is worse than a white man calling a black man a nigger?'' Mr. Gregory said, quoting his son. ''Calling a white man Michael Richards.''</p>
