        <p>INQUIRIES AT INTERIOR DEPT. The Justice Department has begun two criminal inquiries into the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which is already the focus of inquiries into its collection of royalties for oil and gas produced on federal property. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>'LEANER, THINNER CITIGROUP' Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's chairman and chief executive, promised analysts and investors a ''leaner, thinner Citigroup.'' A major part of that plan, Mr. Prince, above, said, will be the bank's new chief operating officer, Robert Druskin, who has a reputation as a cost-cutter. [C1.]</p>
        <p>OPEC TO REDUCE OUTPUT The OPEC oil cartel said that it planned to reduce its output by nearly 2 percent in February, the group's second production cut in two months and the strongest indication yet that it would seek to keep oil prices above $60 a barrel next year. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EFFORT TO REDEVELOP SLUMS An unusual government program in Mumbai, India, encourages investors to raze entire slums and use part of the land to build rent-free tenement houses. In return, investors can build lucrative towers on the rest of the property. [C8.]</p>
        <p>AN INVITATION TO TRY AGAIN Wal-Mart Stores, after stunning Madison Avenue by tossing out the results of a lengthy search for new advertising agencies, asked four of the five finalists to take another shot at the $580 million assignment. One declined. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>DOW CLOSES ABOVE 12,400 Wall Street resumed its fourth-quarter rally, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to its first close above 12,400, after a series of strong company earnings and a drop in unemployment claims revived investors' confidence in the economy. [C10.]</p>
        <p>CLAIM OF GASOLINE OVERCHARGES Seventeen oil companies and gasoline service stations were named in a class-action lawsuit contending that they overcharge customers at the pump by failing to compensate for changes in gasoline volumes when temperatures rise. [C10.]</p>
        <p>DEAL FOR GERMAN BROADCASTER Two private equity firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Permira, agreed in principle to buy the largest private German TV broadcaster, ProSiebenSat.1, in a transaction worth about $7.6 billion. [C3.]</p>
        <p>DIFFERING VISIONS IN BEIJING Senior cabinet officials from China and the United States, opening an unusual two-day dialogue in Beijing, promoted clashing visions of how quickly China should move to modernize its economic policies. [C3.]</p>
        <p>RECORD EARNINGS ON WALL STREET Lehman Brothers Holdings and the Bear Stearns Companies, the Wall Street companies most dependent on the fixed-income market, posted record fourth-quarter earnings, helped by corporate bonds and derivatives. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A RISE IN IMPORT PRICES Prices of goods imported into the United States rose last month for the first time in three months because of a jump in the cost of natural gas purchases. [C3.]</p>
        <p>EMI DEAL FALLS THROUGH The EMI Group, the British music company, confirmed what some analysts and investors had been speculating for several days -- a hoped-for takeover by a private equity investor was dead in the water. [C5.]</p>
        <p>ROUGH YEAR ISN'T OVER Chrysler's chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, is racing to put together another turnaround plan for the automaker. It has been a difficult year for Chrysler, which has lost its No. 3 spot in the American market to Toyota and is compiling losses that are expected to top $1.2 billion. [C1.]</p>
        <p>TIMES CO. NAMES FINANCE CHIEF The New York Times Company named James M. Follo, the former chief financial officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, as its chief financial officer. [C5.]</p>
        <p>RECORDING MAGNATE DIES Ahmet Ertegun, the record-company magnate who founded Atlantic Records and shaped the careers of many of the top musicians of his day, including John Coltrane, Ray Charles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, died in Manhattan. He was 83. [C13.]</p>
        <p>CATSKILLS CASINO ADVANCES After more than 10 years of delays, tribal recriminations and opposition from Atlantic City gambling interests, the effort to build a Las Vegas-style casino in the Catskills in New York State took a major step forward. [B1.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>FLOODING IN EAST AFRICA Jeffrey Gettleman reports from Somalia that the floods there are yet another installment of a nation in crisis. An audio report is at nytimes.com/multimedia.</p>
        <p>A NOTORIOUS SYMBOL Gen. Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, who seized power of Chile on Sept. 11, 1973, in a bloody military coup, died on Sunday. A photo slide show of his life is at nytimes.com/multimedia.</p>
