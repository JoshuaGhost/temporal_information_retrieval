        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Written and directed by Paul Bojack  Not rated; 96 minutes</p>
        <p>''Resilience,'' Paul Bojack's dour examination of unexamined lives, is a slow-burning morality tale simmering with self-interest. One of those rare ensemble dramas whose actors work toward common goals rather than individual awards, the movie resolves its creeping escalation of poor judgment and reprehensible behavior with surprising emotional force. By the end, no illusion is left standing, even if getting there demands more patience than the average viewer might be willing to muster.</p>

        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Written and directed by Paul Bojack  Not rated; 96 minutes</p>
        <p>''Resilience,'' Paul Bojack's dour examination of unexamined lives, is a slow-burning morality tale simmering with self-interest. One of those rare ensemble dramas whose actors work toward common goals rather than individual awards, the movie resolves its creeping escalation of poor judgment and reprehensible behavior with surprising emotional force. By the end, no illusion is left standing, even if getting there demands more patience than the average viewer might be willing to muster.</p>
        <p>Alternating intense close-ups with abrupt crosscutting, ''Resilience'' builds its splintered narrative around Jimmy (Henry LeBlanc), a nondescript middle manager with a drinking problem, an imaginary girlfriend and an expensive call girl habit. After faking a work history for his uncle Hodge (Al Rossi), a poor schlub on the brink of homelessness, Jimmy is dismayed to receive threats of exposure from Hodge's volatile son (Steve Wilcox). Fearing for his job, Jimmy embarks on a conciliatory mission as self-serving as it is ill-fated.</p>
        <p>Pinning the actors like moths on a specimen tray, Mr. Bojack's camera reveals a morally compromised world where ends justify means and deception smoothes every relationship. No one here is remotely likable -- even Jimmy's new girlfriend turns out to be a fearful single mother looking for a soft place to fall -- but their ethical trade-offs are uncomfortably familiar. Yes, we all lie, and mostly it's O.K. Until suddenly it's not.</p>
