        <p>SOLOMON--Jeannette R. The partners and staff of Peter J. Solomon Company, L.P. mourn the death of Jeannette R. Solomon, beloved mother of our Chairman, Peter J. Solomon. As a frequent visitor to the firm from its beginnings in 1989, Jeannette Solomon shared her intelligence, independence and spirited persona with us. A strong and vivacious personality, her presence with us was always accompanied by her lively wit and humor. We often benefited from her perspective on whatever subject she chose to discourse on. She was truly a fun person. Mrs. Solomon lived a long and eventful life, contributing her innovative ideas and energies to several charitable organizations, a legacy carried on by her family. We at the firm express our deepest sympathies to Peter Solomon, his brother Dick, and their families. Kenneth T. Berliner President Peter J. Solomon Company</p>
