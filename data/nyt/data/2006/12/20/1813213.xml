        <p>He took turns with his aunt on Friday behind the wheel of the rented van during the 14-hour drive to Brooklyn from their hometown in Tennessee. For Justin Carney, 24, it was the first time that he would see the New York City skyline, experience Brooklyn traffic or meet the friends that his 18-year-old cousin had made over the summer.</p>
        <p>''It's that one-time thing,'' his mother, Regina, said yesterday. ''Most people don't ever get to visit New York.'' Ms. Carney, 49, was at home in Clarksville, Tenn., a small town on the outskirts of Nashville.</p>

        <p>He took turns with his aunt on Friday behind the wheel of the rented van during the 14-hour drive to Brooklyn from their hometown in Tennessee. For Justin Carney, 24, it was the first time that he would see the New York City skyline, experience Brooklyn traffic or meet the friends that his 18-year-old cousin had made over the summer.</p>
        <p>''It's that one-time thing,'' his mother, Regina, said yesterday. ''Most people don't ever get to visit New York.'' Ms. Carney, 49, was at home in Clarksville, Tenn., a small town on the outskirts of Nashville.</p>
        <p>But she said it is a trip she wishes her son had not taken.</p>
        <p>After spending one weekend in New York, Mr. Carney was fatally stabbed on Monday evening outside the East Flatbush apartment where he had been staying, the police said.</p>
        <p>His family said they thought Mr. Carney, a father of two who planned to be married in a few months, was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, according to what the police have told them.</p>
        <p>''It was mistaken identity,'' said his aunt, Tracy Norfleet, 42. ''It was not drug related, not gang related, none of that.''</p>
        <p>The police last night would not release any working theories or motives for the crime. They did say, however, that nothing was taken from Mr. Carney or his cousin, Joshua Norfleet, 18.</p>
        <p>They said that Mr. Carney and Mr. Norfleet scuffled with two men dressed in black hooded sweatshirts about 6:15 p.m. on Monday. The two men fled after the stabbing, the police said, and as of last night no arrests had been made.</p>
        <p>''He was a person who didn't really bother people unless he was bothered,'' Ms. Carney said, adding that her son had no connection to anyone in New York except his cousin. ''Nothing that he would have been involved in prior here would have prompted this,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, Mr. Carney and his cousin went out for something to eat, Ms. Norfleet said. She and her fiancé were watching television, she added, when they heard a commotion outside the basement apartment.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was them playing,'' she said, but then she realized her son was yelling for help. When she and her fiancé got outside, her son said they had been attacked.</p>
        <p>She found Mr. Carney just inside a doorway a few steps down from her apartment on East 54th Street. A resident of the building, Shirley Ridgewood, was hovering over him. He had stumbled in, bleeding profusely, Ms. Ridgewood said.</p>
        <p>''All he said was help me, help me,'' Ms. Ridgewood said yesterday, adding that one of her family members called 911. ''We did what we could,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the scuffle, Joshua was hit in the nose, Ms. Norfleet said, but managed to punch whoever attacked him, and he said he heard something fall to the ground, and that it was a knife. ''My son could have been a homicide victim as well,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The police said no knife was found at the scene.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norfleet said that Mr. Carney had come to New York to help her move in with her fiancé. She and her son had spent the summer in Brooklyn, she said, and she had decided to make it her permanent home. On Friday, they loaded the rental van with clothes and furniture and drove north.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carney said that she had spent Monday expecting a call from her son because it was her birthday.</p>
        <p>In Clarksville, his relatives and his fiancée, Keonas Brooks, holding their 2-week-old daughter, gathered in the house where he lived with his parents and his siblings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carney was planning to marry Ms. Brooks in about three months, his mother said.</p>
        <p>He had another son, almost 2 years old, who lives in Alabama, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brooks, 19, who lives with her parents in Clarksville, wept as they showed a reporter pictures of Mr. Carney in the hospital holding his newborn daughter.</p>
        <p>''He should never have went,'' she said.</p>
