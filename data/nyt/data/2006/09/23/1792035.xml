        <p>The flirty surgeons prevailed over the forensic investigators in Thursday night's much-anticipated television matchup. According to Nielsen's estimates, ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy,'' starring Patrick Dempsey, below, whose character is often referred to as ''Dr. McDreamy,'' captured 25.1 million viewers. It topped the premiere of CBS's Thursday goliath, ''CSI,'' by 45 percent in the vaunted demographic of adults 18 to 49. ''CSI'' drew a formidable 22 million total viewers, although that figure was down 24 percent from last year's debut. NBC's premiere of ''ER'' led at 10 p.m. with 15.6 million viewers. Although the ''Grey's Anatomy'' momentum slowed at 10 p.m., ABC's ''Six Degrees,'' the latest from J. J. Abrams (''Lost''), still fared 38 percent better among adults 18 to 49 than CBS's older-skewing ''Shark,'' with James Woods, which drew 15 million total viewers. Notably, however, ''Six Degrees'' lost 4 million viewers in its second half, averaging 13.3 million viewers for the hour. In the 8 p.m. slot, CBS's ''Survivor: Cook Islands'' held relatively steady from last week with 17.3 million viewers, while premieres of NBC's ''My Name Is Earl'' (8.9 million) and ''The Office'' (9.1 million) were third behind ''Survivor'' and a special ''Grey's Anatomy'' retrospective (13.5 million).</p>
