        <p>EACH day as I passed the Schoenfeld Theater on West 45th Street, where the revival of ''A Chorus Line'' is opening in two weeks, I looked upward and felt a kinship with the tense yet hopeful auditioners on the poster.</p>
        <p>Like them I was looking to beat the odds on Broadway. I was in search of a cheap ticket, the cheapest to be found, and that meant rushing each afternoon to the lottery line for ''Avenue Q'' -- at the Golden, two doors down from the Schoenfeld -- where I waited with a few dozen others in penny-pinching anticipation for a young man in a T-shirt to pick my name out of a white plastic bucket and save me $80.</p>

        <p>EACH day as I passed the Schoenfeld Theater on West 45th Street, where the revival of ''A Chorus Line'' is opening in two weeks, I looked upward and felt a kinship with the tense yet hopeful auditioners on the poster.</p>
        <p>Like them I was looking to beat the odds on Broadway. I was in search of a cheap ticket, the cheapest to be found, and that meant rushing each afternoon to the lottery line for ''Avenue Q'' -- at the Golden, two doors down from the Schoenfeld -- where I waited with a few dozen others in penny-pinching anticipation for a young man in a T-shirt to pick my name out of a white plastic bucket and save me $80.</p>
        <p>Broadway is one of the great symbolic cultural forces in New York, representing ambition and its demands, success and its risks, and the magical power of song and dance to separate people from their money. These days that means more money than ever.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years ago ''Nicholas Nickleby'' became the first production to sell a $100 ticket, and it took a decade before another show, ''Miss Saigon'' in 1991, crossed that threshold again. But of the 20 shows now on Broadway, 17 have hit the century mark, and that's not even for the best spots: ''premium'' seats are in the $200 to $300 range. For the week that ended last Sunday the average ticket cost slightly more than $78, according to the League of American Theaters and Producers.</p>
        <p>But Broadway is also one of New York's great bargain districts, with a range of incentives and discount programs -- some well known, some obscure -- to lure bodies into seats. It is still possible to attend even the most in-demand shows at remarkably good prices, but it's not easy. For me a week of cheap-ticket hunting demanded such patience, and offered such repeated disappointment, that I began to feel as if I were in some kind of cheapskate ''Waiting for Godot.''</p>
        <p>My first stop was the place known to budget-conscious theater lovers simply as The Booth.</p>
        <p>Operated by the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, the TKTS booth is the fish market of Broadway: a noisy, teeming bazaar where frugal buyers inspect the catches of the day. The offerings are plays and musicals, both Broadway and Off Broadway, whose producers have decided to sell tickets at a markdown, usually of 25 to 50 percent.</p>
        <p>What turns up there is unpredictable from day to day, though it often follows the general pattern of a show's popularity. Don't expect to find tickets to the revival of ''A Chorus Line'' the week after it opens. New productions sometimes go on sale there when in previews but disappear if they become a hit, a spokesman for the Theater Development Fund said, only to reappear months or years later when they cool off.</p>
        <p>The original booth, consisting of a trailer (later two) and a jungle gym of pipes and white vinyl panels, opened in 1973 in Father Duffy Square and was supposed to be temporary, but it stood for 33 years. In May ground was broken on a new, $12.5 million structure there that promises granite and a 27-step glass staircase; the daily ticket market was moved to a temporary spot -- really temporary, this time, they say -- in the ground-floor plaza beneath the nearby Marriott Marquis Hotel. There is also a TKTS annex downtown, at South Street Seaport.</p>
        <p>On a recent drizzly Tuesday afternoon I began my hunt. First revelation: Inclement weather is the stingy theatergoer's friend. While on a nice day there might be hundreds of people snaked in long lines next to the Marriott's walls on this day there were no more than two dozen. I asked the clerk what his cheapest ticket was. ''Martin Short, 46 bucks,'' he said curtly. ''Everything else is 50.'' I chose ''Rent.''</p>
        <p>The tickets were 50 percent off, seemingly a deal that anyone could be proud of. But my seat left me with the feeling that I had gotten no great bargain. My $50.50 put me in B15 in the rear mezzanine, far stage right and about halfway back. At the Nederlander, where ''Rent'' plays, all but the last four rows of the balcony sell at the top price of $95; if I had moved three rows back, I would have paid a boothless $45.</p>
        <p>The setting for the story about AIDS and bohemian poverty, a loft on 11th Street at Avenue B, is a location that sounds pretty expensive these days, and I wondered if any of the young women who seemed to make up the largest constituency in the audience were feeling a similar disconnect from the show, which opened in 1996. Just then I heard one ask, ''Mom, what's AZT?''</p>
        <p>Besides TKTS the Theater Development Fund also offers substantial discounts to members, who must fit certain criteria to join, like being a teacher, student or civil servant. I qualified as a member of a union, so I paid the $25 annual charge and scanned the Web site (tdf.org) for a show. One that had just opened jumped out: ''Kiki &amp; Herb: Alive on Broadway,'' for $29.</p>
        <p>The last time I saw Kiki &amp; Herb was six years ago at the Fez downtown, where they performed a raunchy send-up of a Christmas cabaret show that juxtaposed ''Frosty the Snowman'' and ''Smells Like Teen Spirit.'' I couldn't wait to see what they would do at the Helen Hayes Theater.</p>
        <p>But I hesitated, and when I returned to the site two days later, the offer had expired. Feeling like a failure, I slumped my way back to the TKTS booth and paid $44.25. This time, however, I was amazed to find that my 50-percent-off ticket led to seat G7 in the front orchestra, far to the side again but only seven rows back. A better value, and just in time: the show closed 11 days after I saw it. (I benefited from its relative unpopularity. The week I attended, ''Kiki &amp; Herb'' played at 49 percent capacity, while ''Rent'' was at 81 percent.)</p>
        <p>I knew I could do better than $44.25, but it would require guerrilla tactics, which on Broadway means a lot of waiting in line.</p>
        <p>Most shows offer heavily discounted ''rush'' tickets -- a small number of seats sold each day to the dedicated or miserly who wait in a special, often long, line -- though they are usually not advertised prominently and their rules are strict. ''Rent'' pioneered the sale of these tickets by lottery, and the practice quickly caught on around Broadway.</p>
        <p>The show I was most interested in seeing, ''Avenue Q,'' calls for the hopefuls to fill out little pieces of paper a couple of hours before each performance (the schedule varies), requesting one ticket or two, and then return a half-hour later for the drawing. I was both determined and miserly.</p>
        <p>The show offers 12 orchestra seats at each performance for $21.25 -- a $101.25 value -- and each day I competed, only a few dozen people showed up. At the third drawing, on a sunny Friday afternoon with the longest line, the young man from the box office awarded 11 tickets and then couldn't give away a 12th because no one wanted a single. After several minutes of this, he took his hand out of the bucket and said: ''O.K., here's what we're going to do. Pick a number between 1 and 20.'' He hadn't made it to my side of the line before somebody guessed right.</p>
        <p>I don't know if it was the bad weather or fate, but on the fourth lottery, for a Saturday matinee, I finally got lucky. Very lucky. I was the first name picked, and my reward was seat BB102 in the orchestra: front center, close enough to read the serial number on the tool belt of the Gary Coleman character (''No. H427X'') and to feel the chill of dry ice as it rolled off the stage and onto my lap in the dream sequence of Princeton, the earnest but unemployable young lead.</p>
        <p>And perhapsit was just the elation of getting that ticket, but as I laughed to the cheerfully cynical song ''The Internet Is for Porn,'' I felt an instant recognition of the New York of ''Avenue Q'' that I did not in ''Rent.'' Those furry puppets dream of no real estate paradise greater than the Lower East Side as they struggle in a distant corner of what the program identifies only as ''an outerborough of New York City.''</p>
        <p>Where it's cheap.</p>
        <p>This Way to Your Half-Price Seats</p>
        <p>The simplest and most reliable way to get discount tickets to Broadway and Off Broadway shows is the TKTS booth, which is situated temporarily in the ground-floor plaza of the Marriott Marquis Hotel, between 45th and 46th Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</p>
        <p>The booth is scheduled to return to Father Duffy Square, with a significant makeover, by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Tickets go on sale at the booth for evening performances at 3 p.m. and for matinees at 10 a.m. The Theater Development Fund, the nonprofit group that operates TKTS, adds a $3 fee to each ticket, but no other fees apply. Cash or travelers checks only.</p>
        <p>There is also a TKTS annex at the South Street Seaport, at Front and John Streets. It is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets for matinees are sold the day before the show.</p>
        <p>To qualify as a member of the Theater Development Fund and receive other discounts -- some much more than 50 percent -- you must be a student, teacher, civil servant, performing arts professional, employee at a nonprofit organization, member of the armed forces or the clergy, or be 62 or older, and have documentation to prove it. The annual fee is $25. Information and an application: tdf.org.</p>
        <p>Some ticket services offer greater markdowns, but with bigger up-front charges. One, Play by Play (play-by-play.com), which calls itself a ''seat-filling organization,'' offers the chance to buy tickets for $3. Yes, $3. The catch: membership costs $99 a year.</p>
        <p>The School Theater Ticket Program (schooltix.com) offers discount vouchers for Broadway and Off Broadway shows and for events at Lincoln Center. This week ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Stomp,'' ''The Wedding Singer'' and others were listed.</p>
        <p>But for the cheapest tickets available with the fewest strings attached, daily rush tickets are the best bet. Most Broadway shows set aside a small number of low-cost tickets (usually $20 to $25) to be sold to students or, in many cases, whoever wins a lottery. Contact or visit the theater in advance, and note that these seats can be obstructed view, though some are quite good.</p>
        <p>For ''Avenue Q,'' which I saw at the matinee on Saturday, Sept. 2, I filled out a slip of paper at 11:30 a.m. and then returned for the drawing at noon. After three unsuccessful tries, I won a front-row-center seat for $21.25.</p>
