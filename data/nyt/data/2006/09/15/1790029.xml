        <p>Not to harp on this, but the lack of great sportswear from American designers has been a real bummer this week. Maybe fashion's retrenchment into a world in which people wear only party dresses happened because of all the great everyday clothes available at more reasonable prices elsewhere. Just a theory.</p>
        <p>Designers like Trovata and Adam Lippes of Adam Plus Eve -- both showed their collections in informal presentations -- have filled the gap with clothes that have the ease and universal appeal of those available at J. Crew but have more credibility with consumers who don't want to see themselves coming and going.</p>

        <p>Not to harp on this, but the lack of great sportswear from American designers has been a real bummer this week. Maybe fashion's retrenchment into a world in which people wear only party dresses happened because of all the great everyday clothes available at more reasonable prices elsewhere. Just a theory.</p>
        <p>Designers like Trovata and Adam Lippes of Adam Plus Eve -- both showed their collections in informal presentations -- have filled the gap with clothes that have the ease and universal appeal of those available at J. Crew but have more credibility with consumers who don't want to see themselves coming and going.</p>
        <p>Had Trovata, a collective effort by three preppy, beachy young men, showed its collection on a runway, the clothes could have been mistaken for Tommy Hilfiger. Instead, models stood around the Chelsea Art Museum in front of nautical sets, so you could see details up close. Khaki shorts, cutoff or cuffed, bore irregular red stitches, which is the Trovata equivalent of a crocodile logo. An adorable short white safari dress or the enamel buttons on a gray poncho looked like things that were once expensive but are now sort of worn out. People in the Hamptons pay big bucks to get that kind of look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lippes's colors were more tropical and the designs more polished. Adding white paint to an embroidered eyelet dress was as rough as he got. But the general idea was pretty and young, as in a cotton voile blouse in a watercolor print and loose pleated herringbone shorts worn with a grosgrain ribbon belt. ''You know what's great about this?'' said Bobbi Queen, a fickle fashion editor at Women's Wear Daily, on her way out the door. ''They're just fabulous clothes.''</p>
        <p>''Designer fashion'' has offered less convincing reasons for anyone to get excited about buying clothes. An exception is Richard Chai, who demonstrated a precocious range, which began with sportswear ideas -- faded bluejeans and a bomber jacket made of black eel skin -- and ended with evening dresses made of striped cotton and linen gauze. Mr. Chai works so quietly in the details, alternating from handmade pleats to picot edging, that it is possible no one noticed.</p>
        <p>Peter Som, after a few seasons of showing hurried clothes that did not look very rich, nailed the ladylike look for spring. Alas, his lovely organdy Empire dresses and a dove-gray Jacquard cocktail coat with matchy top and skirt came a few seasons too late. But interestingly enough, Mr. Som has some smart new ideas: a loose ''T-shirt'' made of striped men's dress shirt material worn with breezy shorts, and a casual linen tank traversed with bunched-up knots. Finally, luxury insouciance.</p>
