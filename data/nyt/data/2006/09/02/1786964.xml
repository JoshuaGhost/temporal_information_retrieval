        <p>Federal agents continued to investigate the relationship between several Alaska state lawmakers and a major oil services company on Friday, a day after agents raided legislative offices across the state.</p>
        <p>Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service scoured files in the offices of at least six lawmakers on Thursday and interviewed several. A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, Jaclyn Lesch, said agents were in the field again on Friday.</p>
        <p>Ben Stevens, a Republican who is the State Senate president and son of Senator Ted Stevens, is among those whose offices were searched on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lesch would not say how many lawmakers could eventually be part of the investigation nor would she discuss the raids. , But lawmakers and their aides in Alaska said the search warrants and the interviews focused on interaction between lawmakers and the VECO Corporation, a large support contractor for oil and energy businesses whose executives give generously to campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press in Alaska reported on Friday that it had obtained a copy of a search warrant that stated that investigators were seeking ''from the period of October 2005 to the present, any and all documents concerning, reflecting or relating to proposed legislation in the state of Alaska involving either the creation of a natural gas pipeline or the petroleum production tax.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican whose office was not searched, signed the new tax into law last month. The gas pipeline is still in negotiations.</p>
        <p>The A.P. said the warrant sought information about possible payments to lawmakers by VECO executives. The warrant also said investigators were seeking hats or other items bearing the phrases ''CBC,'' ''Corrupt Bastards Club'' or ''Corrupt Bastards Caucus.'' Details about the supposed group were unavailable.</p>
        <p>Amy Menard, a lawyer for VECO, said that a search warrant had been issued seeking information from VECO and that the company ''has information to suggest that federal agents may have been to the offices of VECO Corporation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Menard said VECO had done nothing wrong. She said the company ''has always had a strong interest in Alaska politics, but there's certainly no information we have that would remotely support what we perceive to be the investigation that's going on right now.''</p>
        <p>Critics of Ben Stevens have said he is too close with some companies that benefit from the state. Mr. Stevens has worked as a consultant to VECO while serving in the Legislature. Mr. Stevens, who was appointed to fill a vacant seat in 2001 and was elected to a full term in 2002, is not seeking re-election this year. He did not respond to messages left on Friday.</p>
        <p>Aaron Saunders, a spokesman for Senator Ted Stevens, said by e-mail, ''We have no comment on this matter.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Ben Stevens's office, The A.P. said agents on Thursday searched the offices of Senator John Cowdery, chairman of the Senate Rules Committee; Senator Donald Olson, who is on the Special Committee on Natural Gas Development; Representative Vic Kohring, chairman of the House Committee on Oil and Gas; Representative Bruce Weyhrauch, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; and Representative Pete Kott, chairman of the Legislative Council. All but Mr. Olson are Republicans.</p>
        <p>Jim Pound, chief of staff for Mr. Kohring, said Friday that agents went to the lawmaker's office in Juneau on Thursday ''with no warning'' and took copies of legislation, including the gas pipeline proposal, as well as correspondence from Governor Murkowski.</p>
