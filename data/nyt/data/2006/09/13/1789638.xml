        <p>An Israeli military court on Tuesday ordered the release of 18 Palestinian lawmakers who are members of Hamas, including the speaker of parliament, a development that could help improve the climate for talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>The Israeli court ruling came a day after the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, announced a tentative agreement on a national unity government with the aim of ending the isolation of the current government, led by Hamas. Mr. Abbas on Tuesday urged the international community to deal with the new government, though it could be several weeks before it is formed.</p>
        <p>The developments over the past two days come as Israelis and Palestinians are talking about a renewal of contacts that have been virtually nonexistent since Hamas won the Palestinian elections in January.</p>
        <p>Still, many potential complications could derail attempts to restart a dialogue.</p>
        <p>The Ofer military court, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, ordered the release of the Hamas lawmakers, including the parliament speaker, Aziz Dweik, and three cabinet ministers.</p>
        <p>But Israeli prosecutors are appealing, and the lawmakers are not expected to be released for at least two days. The Hamas members may have to post bail, which would leave open the possibility of prosecution, according to family members who attended the court session.</p>
        <p>Last week, a military court ruled that three other Hamas lawmakers should be freed, but they, too, have remained in custody pending an appeal.</p>
        <p>The court ruling covered the Hamas legislators being held in the southern part of the West Bank. Israel is holding about 20 more Hamas lawmakers and cabinet ministers in the northern part of the West Bank, and a court decision in their case is expected in the next few days.</p>
        <p>Israel classifies Hamas as a terrorist organization, and membership in the group is illegal under Israeli law. The Israelis did not act against Hamas political figures during the group's first few months in office.</p>
        <p>But after Palestinian militants, including members of Hamas's armed wing, seized an Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, on June 25, Israel arrested Hamas legislators and cabinet ministers in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>In the Gaza Strip, Israel began a military operation shortly after Corporal Shalit was captured. On Tuesday, Palestinian gunmen in the southern Gaza Strip shot dead an Israeli soldier, the Israeli military said. Hamas and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed joint responsibility for the killing.</p>
        <p>Since the incursion by Israel began, its military has killed more than 200 Palestinians, including militants and civilians, according to human rights monitoring groups. One other Israeli soldier was killed accidentally by Israeli fire.</p>
        <p>In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Palestinians said a teenage boy was fatally shot during a clash with Israeli troops. The Israeli military said the forces came under attack as they made arrests, and fired on people who threw firebombs at them.</p>
        <p>In the military court decision, a judge ruled that because Israel allowed the Palestinian election to proceed with the participation of Hamas, the group's candidates could reasonably assume they would not be prosecuted for being Hamas members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbas, meanwhile, insisted that jailed Hamas members who held political positions be freed before the formation of a new Palestinian government.</p>
        <p>''Israel has to release ministers, deputies and mayors who have been held recently,'' Mr. Abbas said in a news conference in Gaza, after meeting with the Spanish foreign minister, Miguel Moratinos.</p>
        <p>For Palestinians, release of prisoners is a major issue, central to any discussions with the Israelis. Last week, Mr. Abbas and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, each said they were prepared to meet without preconditions, and both are seeking the release of captives.</p>
        <p>Israel is demanding the unconditional release of Corporal Shalit, while the Palestinians want a large number of Palestinian prisoners freed in an exchange.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian leadership hopes the formation of the new government will bring a renewal of Western assistance severed when Hamas came to power.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Authority needs about $150 million a month to pay government workers and cover other operating costs, but it raises only around $30 million on its own. The rest previously came from foreign assistance, and taxes and customs revenue that Israel collected on behalf of the Palestinians, but has recently been withholding.</p>
        <p>It is by no means clear whether Western countries will resume assistance solely on the basis of a new Palestinian government.</p>
        <p>Israel and Western countries have made three demands on the Palestinian government: that it recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Abbas, of the Fatah faction, has accepted these positions, Hamas has not. Fatah and Hamas have been trying to work around this by saying that Mr. Abbas could negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians, but Hamas would not be involved.</p>
