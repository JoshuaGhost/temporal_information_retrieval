        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Pope's Act of Contrition'' (editorial, Sept. 20) is unfair to Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
        <p>While the pope would never intentionally offend any world religion, he knows that true dialogue must be honest, and that is why his recent controversial remarks were not ''ill-considered comments.''</p>
        <p>They were deliberate and were intended to recall the necessity of conjoining faith and reason: it is the uncoupling of these twin values that has delivered so much needless death in history.</p>
        <p>Ironically, the Muslim response in many quarters has only underscored the veracity of the pope's remarks: a nun was shot to death in Somalia, apparently as a result; several churches were firebombed in the West Bank and Gaza; crowds in Kashmir and London have called for the death of the pope while burning him in effigy; a senior Turkish official compared the pope to Hitler; and an Internet posting by the Mujahedeen Shura Council has called upon Muslims ''to slit their throats,'' meaning Catholics'.</p>
        <p>William A. Donohue  President, Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights  New York, Sept. 20, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Sept. 20 editorial:</p>
        <p>I, too, am offended, but not by the pope's remarks.</p>
        <p>I am offended that Muslims went on a murderous rampage over a cartoon, but expressed no anger when a Dutch filmmaker was murdered in the name of Islam.</p>
        <p>I am offended that moderate Muslims believed that an Afghan should be executed for converting to Christianity.</p>
        <p>I am offended that many Muslims refuse to believe that Muslims perpetrated the 9/11 massacres.</p>
        <p>Most of all, I am offended that when Islamic terrorists strike, Muslims offer no expressions of outrage.</p>
        <p>At most, there is polite regret mixed with equivocations, rationalizations and qualifications from Muslim leaders and a deafening silence from the Muslim street.</p>
        <p>Yet you would have us believe that the problem stems from the pope's absence from an interfaith conference.</p>
        <p>Joseph Borini  Las Vegas, Sept. 20, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''A Challenge, Not a Crusade'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 19), John L. Allen Jr., the Vatican correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter, says Pope Benedict XVI wants ''dialogue with teeth'' with Muslims.</p>
        <p>While it is a rather aggressive image, I do think that we need to do more than chew over the same stale interfaith statements.</p>
        <p>Interfaith partners also need to be aware of sometimes conflicting agendas that are relevant to how a disagreement is presented publicly.</p>
        <p>Besides confusing religion with its many interpretations, some on both sides clearly seek division and to prevent certain developments, like Turkey's joining the European Union.</p>
        <p>As a Muslim New Yorker active in interfaith dialogue, I have noticed a relative lack of grass-roots dialogue with the Catholic community.</p>
        <p>This is especially problematic, since the decentralized structure of the Muslim community makes high-level, top-down dialogue difficult and often irrelevant to the wider community.</p>
        <p>Instead of the tiresome round of global finger-pointing, let's involve local churches in sustained and financed relationship-building.</p>
        <p>Let Catholics and Muslims challenge one another to embody real dialogue in action, serving the poor and disenfranchised.</p>
        <p>It's time to get real.</p>
        <p>Adem Carroll  Astoria, Queens  Sept. 19, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is board chairman of the Muslim Consultative Network.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Media coverage of Pope Benedict XVI's speech has underreported two facts:</p>
        <p>The Roman Catholic Church openly opposed the American-led war in Iraq, and the church has generally opposed the Israeli presence in the occupied territories.</p>
        <p>Muslim leaders, take note:</p>
        <p>On the two most inflammatory issues in the world today, the Catholic Church is on your side.</p>
        <p>Horace Nalle  Atlanta, Sept. 20, 2006</p>
