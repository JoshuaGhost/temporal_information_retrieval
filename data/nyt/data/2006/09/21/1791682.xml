        <p>Catholic Channel Ready to Go on Air</p>
        <p>The Catholic Channel, announced in May, will begin broadcasts on Tuesday on Sirius Satellite Radio, the Archdiocese of New York and Sirius announced yesterday. On the air 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on Channel 159, it will include talk, a live daily Mass from St. Patrick's Cathedral, frequent appearances by Cardinal Edward M. Egan and University of Notre Dame football and basketball games.</p>
        <p>Bjork and Sugarcubes Reunite for Anniversary</p>
        <p>Bjork, below, will rejoin her old band, the Sugarcubes, to commemorate its 20th anniversary with a concert in Reykjavik, Iceland, on Nov. 17, the BBC reported. Proceeds from the reunion will benefit the band's record label, Bad Taste, one of the most important in Iceland, which releases albums by other bands, including Sigur Ros and Gus Gus. Bjork said on her Web site, bjork.com, that the money would allow the company ''to continue to work on a nonprofit basis for the future betterment of Icelandic music.'' The Sugarcubes had the top single in Britain, ''Hit,'' in 1992 but dissolved soon after, when Bjork left to pursue her solo career.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Justin Bond, perhaps better known as the boozy and bedeviled songbird Kiki, half of the team Kiki and Herb, will appear tomorrow night with the backup band Freudian Slippers and the performance artist Meow Meow at the Spiegeltent at South Street Seaport.  The Gypsy guitarists Tchavolo Schmitt, Dorado Schmitt and Samson Schmitt will appear with the accordionist Ludovic Beier, the violinist Alexandre Cavaliere, the bassist Brian Q. Torff and nightly guests at the Django Reinhardt Festival at Birdland in Manhattan from Nov. 7 to 12.  Rachael Ray, the Food Network host, has teamed up with Epic Records to issue a series of recordings of songs chosen by her, as well to distribute ring tones featuring messages from her.</p>
