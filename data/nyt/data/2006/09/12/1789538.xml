        <p>Nothing added up.</p>
        <p>The Giants outgained the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday night. They rushed for 186 yards -- averaging 6.6 yards a carry -- and allowed only 55. At quarterback, their Manning brother, Eli, had a slightly better game statistically than the Colts' Peyton Manning. The Giants held the ball for more time. They did not allow a sack and punted only once.</p>
        <p>''You'd take it every week,'' running back Tiki Barber said of his team's statistical advantage. ''And you'd usually win.''</p>
        <p>This time, the sum was far less than the game's parts: Zero and one.</p>
        <p>The season began with a 26-21 loss, and the Giants spent the day after searching for meaning. On Sunday night, they had pointed out that they did most things right. They did a few things wrong. Despite the loss, they are still a good team, many said.</p>
        <p>But Coach Tom Coughlin had a message for his players Monday.</p>
        <p>''I really think we've got to stop talking about being good and get good,'' he said. ''Get good and play good. All of these expectations and all of this talk, it's all nice and it's all wonderful to hear. Boom -- it doesn't mean a thing if you don't win. You've got to win. You've got to perform when the pressure is on. Our game is all about pressure, and you have to win.''</p>
        <p>This could represent a turning point in Coughlin's tenure. On Monday, the message -- that it was time to stop finding fragments of solace in performance instead of the black-and-white results -- had started to sink in for the players.</p>
        <p>The Giants seem to feel that they beat themselves against the Colts. And it might make sense that losing that way, while frustrating, would be more palatable than the doom that accompanies a team that felt it was overmatched.</p>
        <p>''That would be the easy way out for us, to say, well, we had a moral victory, we're still confident,'' center Shaun O'Hara said. ''No, we've got to set our standards higher.''</p>
        <p>So the Giants focused on mistakes, not accomplishments. The most bothersome mistakes were their 10 penalties, 9 of them called on the offense.</p>
        <p>Five penalties were for false starts, called on five different players. Guard David Diehl was called for one on a third-and-1 play in the third quarter. O'Hara was penalized on the Giants' frenzied final drive, when he double-pumped a snap to Manning near midfield with 18 seconds left. It subtracted 5 yards and 10 seconds from the clock.</p>
        <p>Such jumpiness creates concern for the Giants with a game in Philadelphia on Sunday and in Seattle the next week. Last year, when they faced a noisy crowd in Seattle, the Giants committed 11 false-start penalties.</p>
        <p>Diehl and O'Hara said the Colts' defensive players were imitating Manning's cadence, shouting out ''hut, hut,'' in an effort to fool the offensive players. The Giants complained that such a tactic was against the rules, but no penalties were called.</p>
        <p>''You can't win if you beat yourself,'' Coughlin said. ''Good teams do not do that to themselves. And although I would argue in the right place and the right time about a couple of the calls, the five false starts remain there, and there just is no excuse.''</p>
        <p>His biggest argument stemmed from a third-and-2 play with a little more than four minutes remaining and the Giants trailing, 23-21. Manning passed to Tim Carter near the sideline for a 19-yard gain, but Carter was called for pass interference. Replays showed little, if any, contact between Carter and cornerback Nick Harper, who slipped and fell. Harper intercepted Manning on the subsequent third-and-11 play.</p>
        <p>Carter still seemed shocked by the call Monday after reviewing it with the coaches.</p>
        <p>''They were saying it was a really good route, a beautiful route,'' he said. ''Technique-wise, it was excellent. Nothing to really change.''</p>
        <p>There is no recourse for the Giants on questionable calls, of course. Coughlin fills out a report on the officiating each week and sends it to the N.F.L. office.</p>
        <p>''You get the report back telling you why it was a call, why it wasn't a call, etc.,'' Coughlin said. ''The problem that you have, from the standpoint of the coaches in the league, is there's no satisfaction in it whatsoever. Even if they say you're right, what does that prove? Nothing.''</p>
        <p>All that matters is that it was called. Coughlin, of all people, should appreciate the finality of that. He is preaching that all that matters is the result. Even if the Giants say they played well, and even if they are right, what does that prove?</p>
        <p>Nothing. The result comes out the same every time: zero and one.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Tom Coughlin said he did not know if guard Chris Snee's ankle injury would prevent him from playing Sunday. ''I'm not sure what you'd call it,'' Coughlin said. ''It's a nonfracture, but the ankle is injured.''</p>
