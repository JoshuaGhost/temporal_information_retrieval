        <p>THOUGH its hotel managers and investment authorities are gracious enough to avoid looking pleased about it, the war in neighboring Iraq has provided a significant charge to Jordan's economy and status as a business-travel destination over the last three years. The country has drawn executives from contractors like the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services and consultants for charities like the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>

        <p>THOUGH its hotel managers and investment authorities are gracious enough to avoid looking pleased about it, the war in neighboring Iraq has provided a significant charge to Jordan's economy and status as a business-travel destination over the last three years. The country has drawn executives from contractors like the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services and consultants for charities like the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
        <p>But Jordan, which has been ruled by the Hashemite royal family since gaining its independence from British rule in 1946, has few natural resources, and is hoping that its emergence as a thriving business destination for textiles and clothing manufacturers, international development professionals and information technology experts will have a life and reputation of its own beyond the turmoil in Iraq.</p>
        <p>AIRPORT -- Entering Queen Alia International Airport -- airy and modern and about a half-hour's drive from downtown -- is often a battering experience. Jordanian line etiquette tends to be poor, and passengers form a pushing, shoving scrum at the first security checkpoint.</p>
        <p>LOCAL FLAVOR -- Even in a region that is known for its warmth in greeting guests, Jordanians are surpassingly kind to visitors. Amman's most cosmopolitan residents still make frequent reference to Bedouin traditional hospitality, and no business meeting is complete without sugary tea, fresh fruit and often sticky date- or nut-filled sweets.</p>
        <p>LANGUAGE -- English is universally taught in Jordanian public schools, and most Amman residents understand at least a little. Efforts to learn and speak a few words in Arabic will earn smiles all around. Though Arabic learners are usually taught the formal greeting, salam alekhum (peace be upon you), marhaba (hi) is more friendly and informal. A shukran (thank you) is always appreciated.</p>
        <p>FOOD -- Jordan's national dish is mansaf, a staggeringly heavy mixture of rice, lamb, powdered dried yogurt and nuts often served with a cooked sheep's head perched right on top. Mansaf is usually prepared and eaten in Jordanian homes, for special occasions, so visitors may have to wait for an invitation.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DRESS -- Suits are most common in a business setting, though visiting women may want to err on the modest side.</p>
        <p>LOCAL DRESS -- Many local men wear the traditional dishdasha, a loose white gown for work or leisure. Outside Amman, most Jordanian women wear the hijab, or Islamic head scarf.</p>
        <p>SCENERY -- Amman was originally built, like Rome, on seven hills, but now sprawls over 19. Its landscape, dry and rocky and covered with cypresses and gray-green olive trees, is reminiscent of a scene from an illustrated book of Bible stories, though cut through with highways and shopping malls.</p>
        <p>WORTH KNOWING -- Jordanians are fond of gossiping about their royal family, in hushed tones, though visitors may want to broach this topic with care.</p>
        <p>GETTING THERE -- Royal Jordanian Airlines offers nonstop service from Kennedy Airport on Sundays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. For daily service, Air France offers flights from Kennedy to Amman, connecting in Paris at the Charles de Gaulle Airport.</p>
