        <p>The two major candidates for governor of New York gave their support yesterday to a new agreement under which federal and state agencies would become the anchor tenants of the Freedom Tower under construction at ground zero.</p>

        <p>The two major candidates for governor of New York gave their support yesterday to a new agreement under which federal and state agencies would become the anchor tenants of the Freedom Tower under construction at ground zero.</p>
        <p>The endorsement by the two candidates, Eliot Spitzer and John Faso, is a step forward for the project, the centerpiece of the reconstruction effort in Lower Manhattan, because it signals that whoever wins the general election in November is likely to continue Gov. George E. Pataki's plans for the skyscraper.</p>
        <p>Under an agreement announced yesterday by Mr. Pataki and Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, along with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, federal and state agencies will occupy about 1 million of the 2.6 million square feet in the building, which is being developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer, the state attorney general, who holds a strong lead in opinion polls and in fund-raising, has questioned the timetable for the project, calling it unrealistic. The project has been hobbled by delays because of disputes over design and security, and questions as to the economic necessity of the building. Meanwhile, construction costs have risen.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Spitzer said the new agreement was a sign of progress. ''I am pleased that Governor Pataki has secured the one million square feet of government tenancy, which is a crucial step in ensuring the financial viability of the Freedom Tower,'' he said through a campaign spokeswoman, Christine Anderson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faso's campaign also welcomed the news of the agreement. ''This is a good step in the right direction,'' a campaign spokeswoman, Susan Del Percio, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, who has at times been frustrated by the limited scope of his authority at ground zero, said the announcement took the city ''another significant step closer to our goal of restoring the World Trade Center site as a hub of commerce in Lower Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone was as enthusiastic about the announcement.</p>
        <p>''This is clearly not an economic decision, but a political decision,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that has monitored land use and development in the region since 1922. ''It really is about symbolism and politics.''</p>
        <p>The completion of the World Trade Center in the early 1970's added 10 million square feet of office space to Lower Manhattan and depressed the commercial real estate market for years. The Freedom Tower, along with three other towers, to be built along Church Street, is expected to add at least eight million square feet of office space.</p>
        <p>''When the World Trade Center was built almost 40 years ago, the government was a growth industry and you could fill up the trade center with government offices, but clearly we're not in a period like that,'' Mr. Yaro said.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Customs and Border Protection, part of the United States Department of Homeland Security, will be one of the federal agencies in the Freedom Tower. ''Homeland security may be the one growth area in government,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''Maybe they'll need more space.''</p>
        <p>Eric J. Deutsch, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district in Lower Manhattan, was more optimistic about the new announcement. ''It's an enormous step forward, a catalyst in getting the project built,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The area had about 110 million square feet of office space before the 9/11 attacks and now has about 85 million, Mr. Deutsch estimated. ''Adding eight million square feet over the next six years doesn't necessarily create a damper on the market,'' he said. ''The economy has picked up in Lower Manhattan, office rents are moving up, vacancy rates are moving down and Class A office space creates a more modern, competitive and effective central business district.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Faso and Mr. Spitzer have pledged to honor Mr. Pataki's commitment to moving the governor's New York City offices into the Freedom Tower. Both have said that state agencies already paying market rents for other space in Manhattan should consider moving into the building.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason that state government offices need to be taking up prime commercial space in Midtown -- as the executive offices and the Empire State Development Corporation do right now -- when the Freedom Tower may provide high-quality space at competitive prices,'' Mr. Spitzer said in a statement in July.</p>
        <p>Whether government employees will want to work in the Freedom Tower remains an open question. The Port Authority, which lost 84 employees in the 9/11 attack, has said it would be too traumatic to have its headquarters employees work in the building.</p>
        <p>Because of concerns raised by the Police Department, the Freedom Tower was redesigned to have a huge fortified concrete base. But the proposed height -- 1,776 feet including the antenna -- and prominent location are still sources of anxiety for potential tenants.</p>
        <p>Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, said, ''This will be the world's safest office building, and this announcement moves us forward to building it.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the mayor would consider relocating city agencies to the Freedom Tower, Mr. Loeser said, ''When we have an announcement to make, we'll make it.''</p>
