        <p>WELCOME to the new season. Same as the old season. And the season before that.</p>
        <p>For most of its history, Broadway was like a train station. Shows came and went; some big hits would stick around for a few years, then leave before too long.

        <p>WELCOME to the new season. Same as the old season. And the season before that.</p>
        <p>For most of its history, Broadway was like a train station. Shows came and went; some big hits would stick around for a few years, then leave before too long. But things have changed, or to be precise, stopped changing. September is traditionally the time when the marquees light up with new titles, productions fresh from the road tryout or from a successful run at a smaller theater.</p>
        <p>This year, however, 10 of the shows on Broadway have played more than 1,000 performances, 7 of them more than 2,000. (Several others, like ''Spamalot,'' ''Jersey Boys'' and ''The Color Purple,'' seem capable of joining the thousand-performance club before they're done, whenever that will be.) Half of the 10 longest-running shows of all time on Broadway -- ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' ''Beauty and the Beast,'' ''Rent,'' ''Chicago'' and ''The Lion King'' -- are still running, and two more -- ''Les Mis√©rables'' and ''A Chorus Line'' -- are about to be revived.</p>
        <p>''Somehow or other,'' said John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer and a producer of the new ''Chorus Line,'' ''Broadway has found a popular form of entertainment that keeps these shows going and going.''</p>
        <p>All of which is good news for those that are already up and running, but potentially terrifying for anyone hoping to mount a new one. There are only 39 theaters on Broadway; if 10 are booked indefinitely, that means far fewer available sites for new shows, and the competition has risen accordingly. Nevertheless musicals or plays that are ready for the stage and have money in the bank generally find a place.</p>
        <p>A number of productions that proved themselves off Broadway will be making the transition this season. ''Spring Awakening,'' the rock musical about adolescence and its discontents that first played at the Atlantic, will open at the Eugene O'Neill on Dec. 10. ''Grey Gardens,'' the musical based on the bizarre lives of Big Edie and Little Edie Beale (aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier), will move to the Walter Kerr for a Nov. 2 opening. And ''The Little Dog Laughed,'' the satire of Hollywood mores that had a successful run at the Second Stage, will open on Nov. 13 at the Cort.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile ''High Fidelity,'' which had been moving forward in the development process without knowing exactly where it might land, got a place to go in the Imperial when ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' called it quits. And if ''The Wedding Singer'' can't make it through the less maritally inclined months of fall and winter, the Hirschfeld will be ready for its next tenant, most likely the Kander and Ebb musical ''Curtains.'' Rocco Landesman, the owner of the five Jujamycn theaters on Broadway, dismisses the idea that there's any shortage of stages. ''If you have a show that anybody has a modicum of interest in,'' he said, ''you're going to have a theater.''</p>
        <p>What you may not have, though, is the theater you want. In addition to the 918-seat Walter Kerr, other small and mid-size theaters -- the 1,079-seat Gerald Schoenfeld and the 1,078-seat Bernard B. Jacobs -- which have often housed straight plays are being occupied by musicals: ''A Chorus Line'' at the Schoenfeld and ''Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me'' at the Jacobs. Other shows have to make do in some of Broadway's least loved theaters, like the three that sit on cross streets -- gasp! -- east of Broadway.</p>
        <p>TO some, the trend toward long-running sure things suggests that Broadway has dumbed down. But it can also be seen as the result of an effort, over more than 30 years, to make the showpiece of American theater a more customer-friendly business.</p>
        <p>''Broadway as we know it today began in the 70's,'' said Nancy Coyne, a founder of the Broadway marketing firm Serino Coyne, which has worked for 8 of the 10 longest-running shows.</p>
        <p>Back then business was off. The city was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Times Square was a danger zone. And the few Broadway and Off Broadway productions that had experimented with credit cards and phone-in reservations had limited success, said Paul Libin, the producing director at Jujamcyn, who at the time was the managing director for the Circle in the Square.</p>
        <p>Then in 1972 American Express was accepted, for the first time, at all Broadway box offices. That allowed people to book tickets by telephone, instead of having to visit the box office or put a check in the mail. By the early 1980's the sales were conducted through centralized offices that could be open 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>The advent of computerized ticketing made purchases easier still. What's more, said Robert E. Wankel, the executive vice president of the Shubert Organization, ''computerizing tickets let us put tickets on sale for a year, which we were not able to do on a hard ticket. And now we can actually sell as long as we want to.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's customers got the opportunity (despite resistance from the Shuberts) to choose their seats when ordering tickets; by the late 1990's people all over the world were able to buy tickets quickly over the Internet; and now, with e-ticketing, an actual ticket is no longer even necessary.</p>
        <p>Over the same period Broadway was learning a new word. In 1972 ''marketing meant going to the A&amp;P,'' recalled Harvey Sabinson, a longtime press agent who later became the executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers. And television commercials, he added, ''were talking heads repeating quotes.'' But in 1972 Mr. Sabinson and the team behind the musical ''Pippin'' started brainstorming and got the idea to include scenes from the actual show.</p>
        <p>A production number from ''Pippin'' was filmed on a soundstage in New Jersey that winter, and a new way of advertising Broadway was born. ''Pippin'' eventually played 1,944 performances, at the time the 10th-longest run ever. The success of the commercial introduced a whole new form of advertising. '' 'Grease' was one of the very first ones,'' Ms. Coyne recalled. ''It was in its fifth year, and no one expected it to go much longer than that. The commercial gave it another three years.'' ''The Wiz,'' ''Evita'' and ''Cats'' followed suit.</p>
        <p>Still, the television commercial that may have been the most significant factor in expanding the Broadway audience was not even for a Broadway show. On Feb. 14, 1978, the New York State Department of Commerce introduced a new ''I Love New York'' commercial that focused on Broadway as a tourist attraction. The impact was immediate and enormous, said George Wachtel, the founder of Audience Research and Analysis. Before that, Broadway ''was a little provincial.'' But afterward, he continued, ''it was what New Yorkers did, it was what high rollers did when they came to New York. 'I Love New York' made Broadway Everyman's theater.''</p>
        <p>The TKTS booth, which opened in June 1973, also brought in the Everyman, offering half-price tickets and helping to fill out the audience for many a struggling show.</p>
        <p>So between 1972 and 1978 Broadway had introduced itself to the credit card market, the computerized ticketing system, telephone reservations, modern television advertising and, by way of the ''I Love New York'' commercial, the rest of the country. The stage was almost set for the perpetual run, long before ''Beauty and the Beast'' was a gleam in Disney's eye.</p>
        <p>What arose next? Prices. When ''They're Playing Our Song'' opened in 1979, Mr. Wachtel said, the top ticket cost $27. Three years later the top ticket to ''Cats'' cost $45, a jump of 66 percent. Prices continued to rise over the next decade, albeit a bit more slowly. But they did not end up scaring people away. ''Shows used to say, 'O.K., we get to the winter, we die,' '' said Emanuel Azenberg, a longtime producer and manager on Broadway who also cited the importance of new, more sophisticated accounting methods. ''But now you could sustain the bad winter as long as spring was coming again because of the prices.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile New York was once more becoming a tourist attraction. Between 1991 and 2005, according to the city's convention and visitors bureau, the number of visitors to New York nearly doubled, to 42.7 million per year. And since 1985, the league reports, attendance on Broadway has grown by almost five million, with nearly twice the proportion of out-of-towners, and a great increase in children and teenagers.</p>
        <p>No one took advantage of the growing -- and changing -- audience quite like the British impresario Cameron Mackintosh, who, through a combination of spectacular productions and business savvy, produced the three longest running Broadway shows in history.</p>
        <p>But other producers have still managed to come up with a few tricks. The year 2001 saw the introduction of premium-price ticketing, selling the best seats at ''The Producers'' for $480. The Internet, and e-mail blasts, provided an advertising medium much cheaper than television. More complex business models evolve all the time. ''We have so much more sophisticated discounting, coupled with premium pricing, and we can anticipate seasonal fluctuations,'' said Kevin McCollum, a producer of the 10-year-old ''Rent,'' which created a lottery system for cheaper tickets. ''There's a lot more shifting of schedules and trying to capture the audiences.''</p>
        <p>And if a show does make it to the tenure track, it can take a page from the playbook of Fran and Barry Weissler, who with their 1994 revival of ''Grease'' and the 1996 revival of ''Chicago,'' perfected the star-replacement technique, giving shows that are years old a calculated injection of buzz every few months. (Is there a single person watching Usher's performance as Billy Flynn who bought tickets just to see how ''Chicago'' is holding up?)</p>
        <p>With this ever-growing inventory of gimmicks, the question at the beginning of each season has become: Which new entry is going to join the marathoners' club? This season will it be ''High Fidelity,'' the musical based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel? Or ''Mary Poppins,'' presented jointly by two heavyweights of the long run, Mr. Mackintosh and Disney Theatricals? Or will it be a dark horse contender, like ''Spring Awakening''?</p>
        <p>After all, this time last year few could have predicted that ''Jersey Boys'' would be likely to tie up the August Wilson Theater for years. That's a heartening example for producers. Except for the ones who want to put their shows in the Wilson.</p>
