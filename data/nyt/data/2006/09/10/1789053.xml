        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Staining the Land Forever,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Sept. 5), lays bare an appalling and systematic attack on our public lands and reveals that President Bush's failure to continue a bipartisan tradition to protect the American wilderness is no oversight.</p>
        <p>Although fear for the future is both understandable and warranted, it is too early to mourn for our wild lands. Rather than grieve, concerned citizens can join the burgeoning counterattack in their defense.</p>
        <p>Across our great nation, hunters, anglers, hikers, campers and more -- Republican, Democrat and independent -- have found common cause working for public lands preservation. Everyone, whether part of an organized group or acting as private citizens, can help ensure that our untrammeled lands will be protected by attending planning meetings, providing comments, asking questions and demanding help from their senators and representatives.</p>
        <p>All of us have a golden opportunity to vote our conservation convictions in November. The American people overwhelmingly favor conservation. Conveying that message clearly will help prevent irreversible mistakes and protect our wild lands.</p>
