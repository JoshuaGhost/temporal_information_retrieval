        <p>How does a residential community deal with an unruly house where renters run wild and the landlord doesn't seem to care?</p>
        <p>In North Caldwell, the police have been summoned to a house on Henry Street 37 times this year on complaints of noisy, destructive behavior by Montclair State University students, Chief Joseph Clark said. The last straw was a party over Labor Day weekend, when 128 of the 205 people packing the house were charged with under-age drinking and other offenses.</p>
        <p>''It affects the quality of life of everybody on that street, in the neighborhood, in our town,'' Mayor Mel Levine said. ''If there was a fire in that house, nobody would have gotten out.''</p>
        <p>Chief Clark said that the landlord, Robert Farley of Landing, N.J., had been uncooperative. ''All I've heard is, 'I'm getting my rent and they're good kids,' '' the chief said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley's phone was disconnected, and he could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Now, officials are taking preventive measures. Chief Clark said that the Montclair State Police had agreed to respond, along with township officers, to complaints about the house to identify and discipline students apart from criminal charges.</p>
        <p>Chief Clark also said he would urge the mayor and the council to support legislation introduced in January by State Senator Shirley K. Turner to make the state's so-called Animal House law apply statewide. (Ms. Turner is from Ewing Township, home of the College of New Jersey.) That 1993 law allows Jersey Shore communities to force property owners to post a bond to cover the cost of property damage or municipal services, including the police, if a property is the source of too many complaints.</p>
        <p>The bill could be just the thing for places like North Caldwell, said Deborah Kole, a staff lawyer for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. ''Landlords don't like to be hit in the pocketbook,'' she said.</p>
