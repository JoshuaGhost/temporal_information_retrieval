        <p>The Gotham Book Mart, one of New York's best known literary landmarks, was saved from closing only two years ago by two white knights who swooped down at the last minute and arranged the purchase of a $5 million building that would house its collection of rare books.</p>
        <p>Now, the 86-year-old bookstore is in trouble again.</p>
        <p>In the last six months, the owners of the building have moved to evict the store and its owner, Andreas Brown. Friends of Mr. Brown's say the building's owners were only trying to help Gotham get on its feet. They say that Mr. Brown, who hoped to buy the building eventually, fell behind on his $51,000 monthly rent, and owes at least $500,000 in rent, taxes, interest and other fees.</p>
        <p>Whether he fell behind because he lost momentum during the difficult transition after the move from the old building or because -- as some friends say -- he devoted his money to his first love, buying more books, and to paying his employees rather than his rent, the Gotham is fighting for its life once again.</p>
        <p>The anonymous benefactors who saved Mr. Brown's store two years ago were Leonard Lauder, the cosmetics billionaire, who shares an interest in antique postcards with Mr. Brown, and Edmondo Schwartz, a real estate developer, according to court papers and a friend of Mr. Brown who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to anger his friend.</p>
        <p>Until now, Mr. Lauder and Mr. Schwartz had managed to keep their identities from the public, even as they arranged to buy an East Side townhouse near Grand Central Station for $5.2 million in 2004 -- and lease it back to Mr. Brown -- a year after he sold his previous building in the diamond district for $7.2 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz's name appears on documents associated with the eviction and lease, but Mr. Lauder's does not. Though a spokeswoman for Mr. Lauder confirmed yesterday that he was involved, she would not say if he was an investor in the property.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that a judge has authorized a city marshal to seize hundreds of thousands of items worth, perhaps, millions of dollars; that the store is closed, though employees are still allowed inside; and that Mr. Brown, who is 73, is no longer living there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown's lawyer, Lawrence D. Bernfeld, said yesterday that the current owner of the building, listed in real estate records only as 16 East 46th Street Property L.L.C., was willing, for just a brief time, to entertain offers to sell the building at below-market price to a new owner who would continue renting to the Gotham. ''Should such a contract go forward, enlightened capitalism will be at work,'' Mr. Bernfeld said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said yesterday that the current owners had performed ''a kind of miracle'' in rescuing the store two years ago, and that he was grateful to them for giving him a chance to sell the building at a favorable price now. ''If it weren't for the two owners, we wouldn't be in this building,'' he said. ''I don't want them to sound like Dickensian characters throwing the widow and children out into a snowbank in the middle of winter.''</p>
        <p>He declined to confirm that they were Mr. Lauder and Mr. Schwartz, saying that he had promised to keep their identity secret.</p>
        <p>He said his small staff was working furiously to catalog about $3 million in books and art for sale on the Internet, which he believed would give a boost to the store.</p>
        <p>Invoking Mark Twain, Mr. Brown said, ''Word of my demise has been greatly exaggerated.''</p>
        <p>In papers filed during eviction proceedings in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Mr. Brown pleaded with Mr. Schwartz to give him a reprieve. ''I am doing my utmost to save the Gotham Book Mart from closing, but I am a 73-year-old man who is recovering from his third hernia operation,'' Mr. Brown said in an affidavit in April. He noted that fans of the Gotham have included Arthur Miller, John Updike, Tennessee Williams, Ezra Pound, J. D. Salinger, Katharine Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, among others.</p>
        <p>''It will be New York City's loss as well if the Gotham Book Mart is evicted and effectively shut down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has kept the warrant for his eviction quiet by putting up signs on his storefront at 16 East 46th Street, implying that he is on vacation. The signs read, ''Wise Men and Women Gone Fishin','' a sly reference to the bookstore's famous motto, ''Wise Men Fish Here.'' He has also resisted displaying a red-lettered poster marked ''Marshal's Legal Possession.'' But the marshal's sign was taped to the front door last week, and its telltale presence was reported Monday in The New York Sun.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, those who walk by the store see the security gates pulled down. Sometimes, the lights are on and people can be seen inside, but the store is closed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauder was not available for comment yesterday, a spokeswoman said, and Mr. Schwartz, through his lawyer, declined to comment.</p>
