        <p>A songwriter who co-wrote the 1960 pop hit ''Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini'' was stunned to read on a television screen this week that he had died -- apparently after another man who claimed authorship of the song died and left behind confused survivors.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press on Tuesday carried an obituary reporting that Paul Vance had died on Sept. 6 at his home in Ormond Beach, Fla., citing his wife as its primary source. The A.P.'s managing editor, Mike Silverman, who is based in New York, said yesterday that the news service report was prompted by an obituary published earlier this week in The News-Times of Danbury, Conn.</p>

        <p>A songwriter who co-wrote the 1960 pop hit ''Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini'' was stunned to read on a television screen this week that he had died -- apparently after another man who claimed authorship of the song died and left behind confused survivors.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press on Tuesday carried an obituary reporting that Paul Vance had died on Sept. 6 at his home in Ormond Beach, Fla., citing his wife as its primary source. The A.P.'s managing editor, Mike Silverman, who is based in New York, said yesterday that the news service report was prompted by an obituary published earlier this week in The News-Times of Danbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>That obituary, for Paul Van Valkenburgh, a native of New Milford, Conn., reported that Mr. Van Valkenburgh wrote the song under the name Paul Vance.</p>
        <p>The initial news service report was picked up by news outlets around the world, including by The New York Times. But Mr. Vance -- at least the one who wrote the novelty hit, which was recently used in a Yoplait yogurt advertising campaign -- is very much alive and believes the man who died may have misled his own family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vance, who is 76 and recently moved from Long Island to Coral Springs, Fla., said he was ''kind of shook up'' over reports of his demise. ''What is happening is unreal,'' he said. ''My kids went nuts. My closest friends are still calling.'' Mr. Vance said that two racehorses he owned were scratched from races yesterday because organizers believed he had died.</p>
        <p>Rose Leroux, the widow of the dead man, did not return a telephone call yesterday. But she told The A.P. that she was ''kind of devastated'' by the disclosure, but had no reason to doubt her husband of 32 years. Ms. Leroux had initially told the news service that her husband had not received royalties from the song because he had sold his rights to music-publishing income when he was young. When they met, she said, he was a salesman and later worked as a painting contractor. She said he had also served in the Navy.</p>
        <p>''If this other man says he did it then my husband's a liar, or he's a liar,'' she told The A.P. yesterday.</p>
        <p>The song, co-written by Lee Pockriss, was recorded by the teenage heartthrob Brian Hyland and rose to No. 1 on the Billboard chart in 1960. It has survived as a novelty single and was rerecorded by the eclectic rock act Devo for the soundtrack to the film ''Revenge of the Nerds II.''</p>
        <p>John Castaldo, chief financial officer of the Music Sales Corporation, the publisher representing Mr. Vance, said there was no question that the living Paul Vance was the co-writer of the tune, and added that his company had been collecting royalties for Mr. Vance since at least the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>''Paul Vance is alive,'' Mr. Castaldo said. ''He wasn't in the Navy. He wasn't a painting contractor. Other than that, the story was right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vance said he was considering legal action in response to the news reports of his death, and that he was particularly concerned that companies outside the United States who license his songs would be confused by the reports and would not make payments. ''Believe me, if they think you're dead, they ain't going to send the money,'' he said.</p>
