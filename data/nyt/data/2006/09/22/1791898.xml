      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In one of the more awkward moments surrounding the disclosure of his Jewish heritage this week, Senator George Allen, Republican of Virginia, volunteered that his background had hardly inspired him to start keeping kosher.</p>
        <p>''I still had a ham sandwich for lunch,'' Mr. Allen told The Richmond Times-Dispatch, referring to rules against eating pork, ''and my mother made great pork chops.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Allen did not fully grasp the sensitivities at first, he did find himself in a growing group of political figures who have discovered their Jewish roots late in life.</p>
        <p>The responses to his situation, which included bad ethnic humor and serious debates about denial and anti-Semitism, focused attention on the power of religious, ethnic and racial identities in politics, forces that may not have the power they once did. But those forces remain sufficiently alive that Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, a Mormon, will almost certainly face questions about his religion if he runs for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, political operatives say, what matters is not so much Mr. Allen's bloodlines but his handling of the news that his mother was born Jewish, a fact that both say she told him last month.</p>
        <p>''People are always curious about the backgrounds and the attitudes that people bring into a race, and especially someone who has been touted as a potential presidential nominee,'' said Wesley K. Clark, a retired general and former Democratic presidential contender who learned at age 23 that his father was Jewish.</p>
        <p>What may ultimately distinguish Mr. Allen from politicians like Madeleine K. Albright and Senator John Kerry, who both learned the full extent of their Jewish histories on the public stage, is the manner in which his narrative has unfolded. It is occupying a place in a campaign that has already left him on the defensive over racial sensitivity and his efforts to incorporate his newly discovered background into a political identity as a Christian conservative.</p>
        <p>After initially sidestepping questions about his Jewish roots, Mr. Allen played them down and then had his campaign accuse his Democratic rival of anti-Semitism. Only on Wednesday did his mother confirm that she had hidden the family history from her son for decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen went on the offensive, declaring himself a champion for all minorities. ''Now, it's personal,'' he said Thursday in an interview on CNN.</p>
        <p>The development came on the heels of his ''macaca'' comment, a phrase he used to describe an Indian-American aide to his opponent that has become shorthand for the race and ethnicity problems that have plagued Mr. Allen's campaign for weeks.</p>
        <p>Even some of his friends say that handled differently the news of his background could have developed into a sympathetic storyline.</p>
        <p>Candidates like Mr. Kerry and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton handled similar developments deftly enough to appeal to the Jewish community without, in the view of their supporters, appearing exploitative or abandoning the Christian traditions in which they were raised.</p>
        <p>In Mrs. Clinton's Senate race in 2000, The Jewish Daily Forward reported that Mrs. Clinton's step-grandfather was Jewish.</p>
        <p>For any Democrat in a similar spot, of course, the landscape is much less complicated. The Democratic Party has long been the predominant home for most religious and ethnic minorities, including Jews.</p>
        <p>The situation is more complex for Mr. Allen.</p>
        <p>William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, said the incident especially ''struck a nerve with Jewish Republicans.''</p>
        <p>''It's simply the way he handled it,'' Mr. Kristol said.</p>
        <p>But in a Southern state that was once a slave state, where white voters are predominant and cultural and political conservatives are a majority, Mr. Allen has seemed to struggle to find the right words to address his newfound identity.</p>
        <p>After initially responding defensively to a television news reporter who asked him directly on Monday about his Jewish ancestry and saying it was important not to make ''aspersions about people because of their religious beliefs,'' Mr. Allen later said his objection was to a preceding question, about whether his mother had taught him the word ''macaca.''</p>
        <p>By midweek, the campaign accused its Democratic opponent, James Webb, of using ''anti-Jewish ploys.'' Mr. Allen's campaign issued statements saying that, among other things, Mr. Webb had approved a flier in his Senate primary that had anti-Semitic overtones, an accusation that Mr. Webb has denied.</p>
        <p>On CNN, Mr. Allen spoke forcefully about combating discrimination, saying he had recommitted to fight for tolerance.</p>
        <p>He also said his mother, after releasing him from a promise to keep the family secret, had started to find out who her real friends were.</p>
        <p>Democrats have, of course, taken delight in watching Mr. Allen confront another difficult episode.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Kerry said that the news ''would be nothing more than a piece of trivia if it wasn't clear that George Allen is so uncomfortable with himself'' and that the ''Watergate principle'' applied, with the cover-up worse than the news.</p>
        <p>In an interview published on Thursday in The Washington Post, Mr. Allen's mother, whose unmarried name was Henriette Lumbroso, said she had kept the news from her son until a discussion after a report in The Forward about her family and its experience in Tunisia. She said her father had been imprisoned during the Nazi occupation of Tunis.</p>
        <p>On CNN, Mr. Allen recounted his mother's saying: ''I didn't want to tell you. Do you love me? You won't love me as much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen said he responded, ''I love you even more.''</p>
