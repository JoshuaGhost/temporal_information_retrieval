        <p>A court sentenced an Iraqi woman to death by hanging for her part in the bombings of three Amman hotels last November that killed more than 60 people. The woman, Sajida Mubarak al-Rishawi, confessed on television days after her arrest that she was to be the fourth suicide bomber but that her explosive belt had failed. Her lawyer argued that the confession had been made under duress. The other bombers, all Iraqis, including her husband, died. Investigators said at that time that she had participated because three of her brothers had been killed in Iraq. Ms. Rishawi showed little emotion in the packed courtroom as the verdict was read. Under the law, death sentences are automatically appealed.</p>
