        <p>Jonathan Papelbon emerged as a dominant closer for Boston this season. He had 35 saves and a 0.92 earned run average when he hurt his right shoulder Friday night. Drafted out of high school by Oakland in the 40th round, he chose to attend Mississippi State for three years. Papelbon, 25, comes from an athletic family. His mother played softball at Louisiana State and his twin younger brothers, Josh and Jeremy, pitch in the minors.</p>
        <p>BILL FINLEY</p>
        <p>THE BEST THING ABOUT PLAYING IN BOSTON -- Playing for the great fans.</p>
        <p>THE WORST THING ABOUT PLAYING IN BOSTON -- Those fans put so much pressure on you to go out and perform. For some people, that works in their favor. I love the pressure. Some can't take it.</p>
        <p>WHAT KIND OF BIG BROTHER WERE YOU? I was a good big brother. I've tried to show them the ropes and go through the tough things in life first, so they can make their adjustments. We went through the typical stuff with roughhousing and some fights, but, no, I wasn't a bully.</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE NEVER BATTED IN THE MAJORS AND YOUR MOTHER WAS A SOFTBALL STAR. WHO'S THE BETTER HITTER? Actually, she was a pitcher, too. So, I'd have to say me.</p>
        <p>OUTSIDE OF BASEBALL, WHAT ATHLETE DO YOU ADMIRE MOST? Well, Roger Clemens is my idol, but he's a baseball player. Outside of baseball, I'd have to say Tiger Woods. I admire what he can do and the mental capacity he has that makes him go out and produce day after day.</p>
        <p>WERE YOU GOOD AS A HIGH SCHOOL QUARTERBACK? I was all right. I got recruited more for football than I did for baseball. I just chose the baseball route. In football, I got recruited by all the SEC schools and the Florida schools.</p>
