        <p>ONE day in 1993, I came home to see four boys of maybe 10 or so standing motionless beside the park across the street from where I lived, their eyes glassy, their jaws agape. Two steps later I realized they were staring through the bathroom window at my naked wife. Her eyes were closed, her head uptilted. She was lathering herself in the shower.</p>
        <p>By then we'd been living in the apartment on Clermont Street in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for maybe six weeks. It was a one-bedroom on the parlor floor of an old brownstone that was actually gray. The facade had been primed but not painted. It had the glamour of a granddad in his thermal underwear.</p>

        <p>ONE day in 1993, I came home to see four boys of maybe 10 or so standing motionless beside the park across the street from where I lived, their eyes glassy, their jaws agape. Two steps later I realized they were staring through the bathroom window at my naked wife. Her eyes were closed, her head uptilted. She was lathering herself in the shower.</p>
        <p>By then we'd been living in the apartment on Clermont Street in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for maybe six weeks. It was a one-bedroom on the parlor floor of an old brownstone that was actually gray. The facade had been primed but not painted. It had the glamour of a granddad in his thermal underwear.</p>
        <p>Like many houses in the neighborhood, it used to be a boardinghouse. At one time it was two separate apartments, so it had two bathrooms. There was a small, dark one in the back, facing east, and a big, bright one in the front right off our bedroom, facing west. This one had a large frosted window right above the tub.</p>
        <p>Inside, the apartment was quite handsome: pressed tin ceilings, marble fireplace, hand-cut parquet floors. And the light! It fluttered in through soaring windows, two at each end of the building. The apartment itself inspired me. No. It seduced me. Simply put, it made me want to write. It was a thing of beauty made to last. This, I thought, is how I want the world to think about my novels.</p>
        <p>I was 31 then, but I'd never lived in New York on my own. At the age of 18, I'd moved from the island of Jamaica to my family's new home in the Baychester section of the Bronx. I left six years later to move in with a girlfriend in Jersey City. I returned, alone, nine years later after moving to Atlanta with her.</p>
        <p>I had moved back in with my parents because I didn't have a job. But I was not in despair. I'd returned to New York from Atlanta to write a novel, and was na√Øve enough to think I'd get it published if I avoided working full time. So there I was, broke and optimistic, believing that the writing gods would honor my commitment to my art.</p>
        <p>And they did. At a gallery opening one night, I met a woman who a year later would become my wife. Love and marriage came with many things -- my wife's computer, her typing services, a medical insurance card, someone meaningful to disappoint if I wrote badly, and my first apartment, at 233 Clermont Street.</p>
        <p>That day in 1993 when I ran upstairs to tell my wife that she was titillating little boys, she was patting down her body with a towel in the bedroom, standing on a rug of light, completely unaware. When I told her what I saw, she laughed. We'd assumed the bathroom window was opaque both ways.</p>
        <p>We bought a curtain for the window. But as long as we lived there, we missed the western light.</p>
