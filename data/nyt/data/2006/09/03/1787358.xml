        <p>Enough already on how many millions this or that chief executive earns, how many stock options are tossed around to keep the Champagne flowing, the McMansion dusted, the Bentley polished.</p>
        <p>As a little back-to-school thought, let's shift gears to a group of workers who earn pennies in comparison but who, it could be argued, play at least as vital a role in society. It is teachers, after all, who try to make sure that those captains of industry have educated workers.</p>
        <p>According to the American Federation of Teachers, the state with the highest average pay for teachers in 2003-04 was Connecticut, at $56,516; the lowest was South Dakota, at $33,236.</p>
        <p>Or look at it this way: Pick a corporate chieftain -- say, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric. He earns $15.4 million a year. Every single day -- including Thanksgiving and Christmas -- he makes almost what the average teacher does for a year of taming wild children, staying up nights planning lessons, and, really, helping to shape a generation.</p>
