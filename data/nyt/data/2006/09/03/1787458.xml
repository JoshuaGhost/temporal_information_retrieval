        <p>Re ''Tunnel Visionaries'' (editorial, Aug. 13), about the planned $7 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson:</p>
        <p>Most New Jersey commuters who arrive at Penn Station New York must also use another form of mass transportation to get to their workplace. That would change if the new tunnel were part of a project that took commuters to Grand Central Terminal through a shared arrangement with the Long Island Rail Road to use the lower tracks. This problem could in part be addressed by extending the No. 7 subway line, not just to Manhattan's West Side, but perhaps as far as Secaucus station in the Meadowlands.</p>

        <p>Granted, this would mean a two-seat ride for many commuters, but it would also reduce the bond issue that New Jersey taxpayers will need to repay in the next generation, as opposed to a shared cost enterprise.</p>
