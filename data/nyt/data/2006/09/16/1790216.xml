        <p>8 P.M. (HBO) FANTASTIC FOUR -- (2005). A group of space travelers -- Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba, left), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) -- use the superpowers they gained after a mission exposes them to cosmic radiation to fend off their enemy, Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (STYLE) STYLE INVADES NEW YORK FASHION WEEK 2007 -- A look at the highs and lows -- and not just hemlines -- on the runways in Bryant Park.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Animal Planet) BATTLE FOR THE BEACH -- The west coast of Costa Rica is prime real estate to an entire menagerie, from ghost crabs and vultures to crocodiles, pumas and humans. But just wait until 50,000 olive ridley turtles arrive.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) AMERICA'S MOST WANTED: AMERICA FIGHTS BACK -- Movie peg: the series re-examines the 1947 unsolved murder in Los Angeles that inspired the film ''The Black Dahlia,'' which opened yesterday.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) MY MUMS USED TO BE MEN -- In the second of four films exploring alternative lifestyles in Britain, a 12-year-old girl discusses what it's like to be reared by two women who were born male -- one of which is her biological father.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Discovery Kids) SERIOUS -- In a new episode of this children's adventure series, eight young British explorers discover that camping out in the Peruvian Amazon is no walk in the park.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Food Network) CHILDHOOD OBESITY: DANGER ZONE -- A frank look at the causes and dangers of childhood obesity, and what people around the country are doing to help youngsters keep from growing out instead of up.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (HBO) KATT WILLIAMS: THE PIMP CHRONICLES PT. 1 -- Self-esteem, marijuana, image vs. reality, race relations, Iraqi insurgents, Michael Jackson -- it's all here in this standup routine from Mr. Williams (right, on a press tour for the BET Hip Hop Awards in July), who won the best Los Angeles comic award sponsored by Cedric the Entertainer in 2001.</p>
        <p>11 P.M. (Fox) MAD TV -- Nicole Parker plays Britney Spears and Ike Barinholtz is Kevin Federline in ''K-Fed in da Howz'' on the 12th season premiere of this sketch comedy show.</p>
        <p>MIDNIGHT (FOX) TALK SHOW WITH SPIKE FERESTEN -- Anyone up for a monologue? In this new half-hour latenight show, Mr. Feresten (left) proves that you don't need comedians to stir up the laughs if you've got an audience to do the work.</p>
