        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in South Africa on Tuesday for a two-day state visit, the first for a Kremlin leader, that reunites two old ideological soulmates under a new banner: making money.</p>
        <p>Hours after landing in Cape Town and meeting with President Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Putin said at a news conference that Russia planned multibillion dollar investments in South Africa, signed a business cooperation agreement and announced a deal to extend sales of nuclear fuel and technology to South Africa's nascent nuclear power industry.</p>
        <p>Wednesday's only important business, wedged before ceremonial visits to scenic Cape Point and the apartheid-era Robben Island prison, is a meeting with 23 Russian and 23 South African business executives about improving commercial relations.</p>
        <p>The deal making decisively overshadowed the historic symbolism of this state visit. When Mr. Putin was but a college freshman and aspiring KGB officer in 1970, Mr. Mbeki was in Moscow, studying Communist ideology and receiving military training as part of the Soviet Union's support for the African National Congress's guerrilla battle against apartheid.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union was the crucial supporter of the African National Congress until the collapse of Communism in 1991. Beyond its commercial importance, Mr. Putin's visit revives a decades-old relationship that grew chilly under their predecessors as president, Boris N. Yeltsin and Nelson R. Mandela.</p>
        <p>''There's quite a lot of sentiment involved in this, going back to the days when President Mbeki and others were trained in the Soviet Union,'' Tom Wheeler, the chief executive of the South African Institute for International Affairs, said in an interview. Mr. Wheeler, a South African diplomat for 43 years, represented his country in formerly Soviet republics of Central Asia in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin clearly is focused on reviving Russia's former status as a world power, Mr. Wheeler said, and reprising old ties with South Africa, this continent's dominant power, makes sense for both sides. For his part, Mr. Putin said at a meeting of ambassadors in June that the end of the cold war had wiped out Africa's old East-West divides, making the continent a new ''field of operations'' for Moscow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin may also be intent on countering China, which in recent years has been striking deals in Africa to sew up supplies of commodities like copper and oil.</p>
        <p>Trade between Russia and South Africa is minuscule -- less than $125 million during the first nine months of 2005, the latest period recorded -- but analysts say the potential is great.</p>
        <p>Both countries are major producers of diamonds, controlling three-quarters of the world's production, and are prime sources of platinum and gold. A Russian holding company, the Renova Group, holds a 49 percent stake in a company holding major reserves of manganese, a key steelmaking component found largely in South Africa.</p>
        <p>A South African runs Sual Aluminum, the Russian concern that hopes to become a world-leading producer by merging with two other major aluminum companies, a move that has won Mr. Putin's blessing. South African mining companies have major investments in Russia, and Russian investors hold a large stake in Gold Fields, a major South African miner.</p>
