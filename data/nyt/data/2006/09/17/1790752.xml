        <p>Two years ago, when a long-awaited wrecking crew finally tore down the 200-foot smokestacks of the shuttered Southwest Brooklyn Incinerator, residents and elected officials in Bensonhurst were there to celebrate. They even had gold-painted sledgehammers.</p>
        <p>It was a joyous day for a neighborhood that had fought for more than 40 years to close the trash facility and keep it closed. But to some residents, that jubilation was shortsighted.</p>
        <p>As part of the mayor's comprehensive plan for trash disposal, which the City Council approved in July, the site on Bay 41st Street where the incinerator stood will become home to one of four city-run waste transfer stations. The local community board endorsed the plan as a cleaner alternative, but its opponents are not quietly accepting the decision.</p>
        <p>''I have a problem putting this right in the middle of a residential area where there are already acute environmental problems caused by having an incinerator there for 30 years,'' Assemblyman William Colton, who represents the area, said on Thursday before a meeting to plan last-ditch strategies for opposing the station on environmental grounds.</p>
        <p>The state's Department of Environmental Conservation must still approve the site for the station to become a reality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colton, who in the mid-1990's was one of the lawyers for residents fighting a proposed reopening of the incinerator, which closed in 1991, contends that the dredging required for barges to land at the transfer station would stir up toxins in Gravesend Bay. In addition, he said, the station will attract increased truck traffic, noise and odors to property surrounded by parks, a shopping center and a marina.</p>
        <p>Jerry Gagliano, owner of the Marine Basin Marina, said that when the incinerator was operating, boat owners had to hose down their boats in the morning to clean off ashes. With that in mind, he said, the city should put all the planned transfer stations in places where they are not next to homes and businesses -- for example, Floyd Bennett Field, the former airport.</p>
        <p>Matthew Lipani, a Sanitation Department spokesman, cited an April 2005 environmental impact study for the trash plan, which addresses the Bensonhurst transfer station. The study says that noise and odors will not be a problem, that increased traffic can be mitigated and that while dredging will disturb silt in the bay ''to some degree,'' the department will take ''appropriate measures'' to minimize effects on water quality.</p>
