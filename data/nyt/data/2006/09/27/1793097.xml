        <p>In a neck-and-neck finish for No. 1 on Monday night, CBS placed first in total viewers, while NBC won the prized demographic of adults 18 to 49. According to Nielsen's estimates, Monday's most-watched show, ''CSI: Miami,'' drew 17.4 million viewers, extending its lead over ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' the new Aaron Sorkin drama on NBC, which declined moderately from its premiere, posting 11.2 million viewers. Meanwhile, NBC won the 8 and 9 p.m. time slots with its dependable game show, ''Deal or No Deal'' (13 million) and the new supernatural series ''Heroes,'' which drew 14.3 million viewers in its debut at 9. Among adults 18 to 49, ''Heroes'' placed just shy of Sunday's ''Brothers and Sisters'' premiere on ABC, which garnered the highest rating so far for any new fall series. On Fox, ''Prison Break'' (8.3 million) finished second among adults 18 to 49 for the 8 p.m. hour, but ''Vanished'' (6.5 million) continued to lag behind in fourth place at 9. Notably, CBS's much-anticipated new series at 8, ''The Class'' (8.5 million), lost nearly two million viewers from its premiere a week before.</p>
