        <p>City officials unveiled a $17.5 million operations center for the Fire Department yesterday that will allow commanders to better coordinate and execute the response to emergencies. The command center, completed in July, was built in response to recommendations made in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. With more than 75 computers, the system can track the locations of Fire Department vehicles and access radio transmissions and live video from police and other helicopters. It will eventually be able to pull up images from 80 cameras installed throughout the city by the Department of Transportation. Officials can also call up aerial photographs of any building in the city and its surrounding areas, allowing those at the command center to alert firefighters at the scene of potential dangers.</p>
