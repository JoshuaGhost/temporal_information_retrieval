        <p>9:30 P.M. (Golf) BIG BREAK VI: TRUMP NATIONAL -- How do you say ''you're fired'' in golf-speak? Tonight, nine men and nine women tee off in a series of challenges at Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles for a chance to compete in Champions and L.P.G.A. tour events. Donald Trump (above, far left, with contestants) makes a cameo appearance in this season premiere -- and sets up a few sand traps of his own along the way.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (11) GILMORE GIRLS -- When last we saw Lorelai, she was climbing into bed with Christopher after Luke refused her proposal to elope. This season opens with Lorelai waking up in bed with Christopher, then trying to erase Luke from her memory. Only now he's the one with the question.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) MYSTERY OF THE MEGAVOLCANO -- ''Nova'' investigates the greatest volcanic explosion of the last 100,000 years and looks at how this blast from the past affected Earth's future.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (NBC) LAW &amp; ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT -- A dead father's womanizing ways lead detectives to a relationship between a teacher and her underage student.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) MOZART AT 250: THE SALZBURG FESTIVAL CELEBRATION -- The Vienna Philharmonic presents a birthday bash of high points from a few of Mozart's operas, performed by Magdalena Kozena, Patricia Petibon, Anna Netrebko, Rene Pape, Michael Schade, Ekaterina Siurina and Thomas Hampson. Daniel Harding conducts.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (ABC) HELP ME HELP YOU -- Some eccentric types try sorting through their troubles in a group session run by a therapist who may have the biggest problems of all. Ted Danson (left) stars as the inappropriately puffed-up Dr. Bill Hoffman; Jere Burns, who proved himself a team player in ''Dear John,'' is a patient with anger-management issues.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (FX) NIP/TUCK -- Case of the week: Shari Noble (Melissa Gilbert), whose dog bit off her nipple, wants breast reconstruction before her husband returns from Iraq.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (HBO) WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: THE SAGA OF THE CHICAGO CUBS -- They used to be the best, but that was almost 100 years ago. Here, loyal fans talk about their dedication to the Major League Baseball team with the longest dry spell -- nearly a century -- between World Series titles.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) BOSTON LEGAL -- Well, that's one way to make an entrance. Jeffrey Coho (Craig Bierko, right) comes in with a bang when he takes on a client accused of murdering a judge on his first day at Crane Poole &amp; Schmidt. Meanwhile, Denny's online date threatens to sue the firm, and Alan defends a cross-dresser who got fired for taking maternity leave.</p>
