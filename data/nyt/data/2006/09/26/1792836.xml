        <p>More than 30,000 New Jerseyans have died of AIDS. About half of AIDS cases in the state can be traced to intravenous drug users who became infected by sharing contaminated needles. Many of these people would never have gotten infected had New Jersey given addicts access to clean needles more than a decade ago, when public health officials and a few politicians began fighting for the plans, which have become integral to AIDS prevention programs across the country and abroad.</p>

        <p>More than 30,000 New Jerseyans have died of AIDS. About half of AIDS cases in the state can be traced to intravenous drug users who became infected by sharing contaminated needles. Many of these people would never have gotten infected had New Jersey given addicts access to clean needles more than a decade ago, when public health officials and a few politicians began fighting for the plans, which have become integral to AIDS prevention programs across the country and abroad.</p>
        <p>Forty-nine states now have some system for providing clean needles to addicts. New Jersey has been the lone holdout -- the only place in the union to stubbornly resist this proven strategy.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature came a step closer to sanity recently when a Senate committee voted out a bill that would permit needle exchange programs in six AIDS-ravaged municipalities, including Camden and Atlantic City. Even so, the committee tabled a crucial companion bill that would have allowed people to buy up to 10 syringes at a pharmacy without a prescription.</p>
        <p>As usual, critics of the plan falsely assert that needle programs would encourage addiction -- which was long ago disproved. Others argue that the state should offer treatment instead of needles. That's an ideal that flies in the face of reality. Even with greatly expanded treatment programs, drug users would need to wait months or even years for help. In the meantime, they would face almost certain infection without access to clean needles.</p>
        <p>Exchange programs that provide addicts with free access to needles, and laws allowing them to buy needles without prescriptions, have nothing to do with encouraging drug addiction. They have everything to do with slowing the spread of AIDS across the United States and abroad. If New Jersey continues to bar these plans, the state will pay a rising price in more infections, higher medical costs and lost lives.</p>
