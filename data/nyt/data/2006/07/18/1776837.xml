        <p>The news? It's hot. In related news, it's mid-July. The heat of summer usually trails a couple of weeks behind the sun, which reached its peak in the northern sky on June 21. In other words, this heat wave is right on time.</p>
        <p>The sound of today's weather is the universal hum of air-conditioners, coast to coast, and one way to measure the heat is to measure the megawatts being used to beat it. The Los Angeles region is likely to break its old record for peak power usage, which was set almost exactly a year ago.</p>

        <p>The news? It's hot. In related news, it's mid-July. The heat of summer usually trails a couple of weeks behind the sun, which reached its peak in the northern sky on June 21. In other words, this heat wave is right on time.</p>
        <p>The sound of today's weather is the universal hum of air-conditioners, coast to coast, and one way to measure the heat is to measure the megawatts being used to beat it. The Los Angeles region is likely to break its old record for peak power usage, which was set almost exactly a year ago.</p>
        <p>As always, there are serious health risks when the heat and humidity get this high, and no one should dismiss them. They include heat exhaustion and the fact that a parked car, in this weather, is a death trap. For most of us, though, the main difficulty is the problem of living in two climates at once: the chill of the air-conditioning at home or the mall or the office and the blazing heat of the raw outdoors. It's hard to say which is more stunning -- stepping inside or stepping out. The rule for dressing in this weather is to wear lightweight, light-colored clothing and carry a heavy sweater.</p>
        <p>To some people, a heat wave like this is simply July as it should be. We all know someone like that, someone who isn't happy till the subways are an inferno and the asphalt is soft and everyone in the city is as sticky as a melting ice-cream cone. They have their wish today. The good news is that cooler air is drifting south from Canada, and the rest of the week will see milder temperatures in the Northeast. We have our wish tomorrow.</p>
