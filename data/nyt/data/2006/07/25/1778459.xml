        <p>The best wedding present arrived in a white box without a bow. It was sent on Friday from Pennsylvania to the Dhaka Club and Restaurant, a catering hall on 37th Avenue in Woodside, Queens, where, like an inebriated guest who never left, it still sat yesterday, chugging 130 gallons of diesel fuel in 85-degree heat.</p>
        <p>Like the hall itself and many things wedding, it was a rental: $1,020 a day plus tax in one of those payment-in-full deals, along with additional charges of $800 for electrical hookup, a pickup and drop-off cost of $1,600, and $400 a day to refill the tank.</p>

        <p>The best wedding present arrived in a white box without a bow. It was sent on Friday from Pennsylvania to the Dhaka Club and Restaurant, a catering hall on 37th Avenue in Woodside, Queens, where, like an inebriated guest who never left, it still sat yesterday, chugging 130 gallons of diesel fuel in 85-degree heat.</p>
        <p>Like the hall itself and many things wedding, it was a rental: $1,020 a day plus tax in one of those payment-in-full deals, along with additional charges of $800 for electrical hookup, a pickup and drop-off cost of $1,600, and $400 a day to refill the tank.</p>
        <p>It was a generator, a sleek Aggreko Whisperwatt, DCA70SSJU2, and for saving the 200-guest wedding reception of a Ms. Rokeya of Branford, Conn., on Saturday, it deserves a turn on the cover of Brides magazine.</p>
        <p>''If a host cancels a party, we cannot have party again,'' Dhaka's manager, Mohsen Rahman, a native of Bangladesh, said in halting English. ''It's bad my reputation.''</p>
        <p>In western Queens, in the eighth day of the blackout, improvisation itself was becoming routine. Whether you were fanning yourself with a newspaper or sitting in air-conditioning, celebrating your wedding or lamenting its cancellation turned on an axis that was, or was not, powered by small but mighty generators. As well as the get-up and go of people who procured the generators, like Mr. Rahman.</p>
        <p>It started on the afternoon of July 17, when the power went out. At first, the strategy of Mr. Rahman and his staff was simply to not open the door to the walk-in freezer. There, 1,500 to 1,700 pounds of goat, chicken and beef were stored for the week's calendar of banquets.</p>
        <p>By the next morning, it was clear that the plan would not work. The kitchen staff (three Bangladeshi cooks and two Mexican cooking assistants) began throwing out the spoiling meat, all of it halal for Muslims and therefore more expensive.</p>
        <p>They also discarded about 250 gallons of milk that was to be used to make sweet yogurt and saffron-laced rice pudding, house specialties served at almost every banquet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rahman continued the painful task of calling his clients to cancel. Already, he had canceled a 300-guest party for Mahod Choudhury, a Bangladeshi businessman from Jackson Heights.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he canceled Mr. Choudhury's other party, a 300-guest birthday celebration for his nephew, Shila Ahmad, who turned 12.</p>
        <p>''I just told him to give my deposit back,'' Mr. Choudhury said. ''What are you going to do? So I lose my day.''</p>
        <p>As the blackout dragged on, Mr. Rahman, who runs the banquet hall on sheets of handwritten paper, demonstrated a speculator's savvy. He decided to cancel events only when he had to, 24 hours ahead of time.</p>
        <p>So when Chiring Sherpa called on Thursday to ask whether a 350-person Nepali lunch for his nephew, Mendolamu, who was turning 1, was still on schedule, Mr. Rahman assured him that it was.</p>
        <p>Hardly. He had been looking for a generator, but there were none to be found in the five boroughs or New Jersey. Then he turned to the New York grapevine. Mr. Rahman's electrician, Shankar Sham, had a friend who knew where Mr. Sham could get one in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Assured that it would arrive on Friday afternoon, Mr. Rahman went ahead and bought 1,700 pounds of halal goat, chicken and beef on Thursday from his meat broker. He stored it in the freezer of Bashundhara, a market on 73rd Street in Jackson Heights whose owner he knows. Then he bought 250 gallons of milk. And waited.</p>
        <p>The generator arrived at 1 p.m. Friday. Mr. Sham began hooking it up.</p>
        <p>It sprang to life on Friday afternoon, too late for the evening wedding reception of Anwar Choudhury, no relation to Mahod Choudhury. But just in time to make the palak paneer for little Mendolamu's birthday party and the vegetable pakora for Ms. Rokeya's wedding reception.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rahman, who never knew the bride's full name, said she wore a red sari and a big smile.</p>
        <p>She could not be reached yesterday. Mr. Rahman said she was on her honeymoon.</p>
