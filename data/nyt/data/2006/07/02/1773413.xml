        <p>What began as a farewell to the American tennis icon Andre Agassi turned, quite unexpectedly, into a farewell to American tennis.</p>
        <p>That Agassi, at age 36, could not find a way to beat Rafael Nadal in what Agassi insists will be his final match at Wimbledon was hardly a shock.</p>
        <p>But who could have guessed that, a few hours later, the defending women's champion, Venus Williams, would lose in three sets in the third round to Jelena Jankovic, the No. 26-seeded woman from Serbia?</p>
        <p>Who would have imagined that, on the same unforgettably forgettable Saturday afternoon, Andy Roddick would go down swinging in straight sets to 19-year-old Andy Murray of Scotland on the court where Roddick played in the final the past two years?</p>
        <p>This was Wimbledon, after all, not that Grand Slam tournament on clay across the Channel.</p>
        <p>''I've pretty much gotten used to that press conference in Paris every year,'' said Roddick, of the now annual questions about American ineptitude at the French Open. ''But obviously, I think it is a lot more surprising, slash, disappointing when it is here, a place that we've all had a lot of success.''</p>
        <p>Not just the stars struggled. Amy Frazier was beaten, 6-3, 6-2, by Maria Sharapova. Mardy Fish, who has made a fine comeback from major wrist surgery, was unable to complete his third-round match because of the flu, retiring after losing the first set to Irakli Labadze of Georgia.</p>
        <p>As Wimbledon moves into its second week, after its traditional break on Sunday, there is only one American left in the men's or women's singles. That is Shenay Perry, an unseeded 21-year-old who is ranked 62nd and will not be favored against Elena Dementieva. It will be Perry's first match in the Round of 16 at a Grand Slam tournament.</p>
        <p>In the 84 years since these championships moved to their current location and the challenge round was abolished, the Americans have never had a worse showing. It is a sign of the globalization of the game that there are as many Poles, Cypriots, Finns, Chinese, Georgians, and, yes, even Britons in the fourth round as there are Americans.</p>
        <p>It was, perhaps, no coincidence that Jankovic's 7-6 (8), 4-6, 6-4 win over Williams came on Court 2, long known as the Graveyard Court because of its penchant for playing host to major Wimbledon upsets.</p>
        <p>''That court plays much differently than the Center Court, so it's even more challenging it seems,'' said Williams, who complained that she was bothered by pain in her left wrist.</p>
        <p>But she hits serves with her right, and when she served at 3-4 in the third set, she double-faulted three times in a row to lose the game at love. Jankovic then tried and failed to serve for the match at 5-3.</p>
        <p>''At the end, I was just so nervous,'' said Jankovic, a former top-20 player. ''I think I felt like the racket was 30 pounds.''</p>
        <p>Jankovic showed no hesitation in the final game, chasing down Williams's increasingly desperate shots and finally breaking her serve. Jankovic closed out the match on her fourth match point when Williams dumped a forehand into the net.</p>
        <p>Roddick, once the world's No. 1 player, has not reached a final this season and has not reached the quarterfinals in a Grand Slam tournament in his last four attempts. He certainly showed no shortage of desire against Murray, ripping through his shots and playing aggressively.</p>
        <p>But Murray fought off eight break points in the first set and three in the second before Roddick finally broke him at 2-2 in the third. He responded by breaking Roddick back immediately. Down the stretch, Roddick kept forcing the issue and kept getting punished as Murray got most of his serves back and hit passing shots and lobs on the run.</p>
        <p>Murray's 7-6 (4), 6-4, 6-4 victory provided a quick lift to a country whose team lost in the World Cup during the match.</p>
        <p>''It would have been great for England to win the World Cup and great for British sport,'' he said. ''But now I'm going to have to try to win here.''</p>
        <p>The loss will drop Roddick to at least No. 10 in the rankings from No. 5. ''I'm not happy,'' Roddick said. ''I'm mad, disappointed, whatever other adjectives you want to throw out there. I'm not that smart, so you think of them.''</p>
        <p>Agassi's era is not quite over. Middle-aged back and mind willing, there is a summer of hardcourt tennis in North America to come. But if he is true to his word, there will be no more tennis at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>Nadal made sure of that in a third-round match that started with plenty of roars, baseline punch and suspense and devolved into a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>Nadal absorbed all that Agassi could throw at him to win in straight sets, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''It's just nice to come back here on my terms,'' said Agassi, who plans to retire after the United States Open in September. ''I'll look back at this as one of my most memorable experiences. To say goodbye, for me, this means as much as winning.''</p>
        <p>In the second round, Robert Kendrick, an American qualifier, served and volleyed against Nadal and came within two points of victory. But Nadal was sensational when Agassi tried to match him strength for strength from the back court. Agassi, one of the best returners in the modern game, never had a break-point opportunity against Nadal.</p>
        <p>''Today I play my best match but is not my day for have a good celebration, no?'' Nadal said in his still-rudimentary English. ''Is his day.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, the fans wanted more Agassi for their money and their memory banks. He was greeted with standing ovations before each of his matches this year, and he was greeted with another after he and Nadal, who is 16 years his junior, embraced at the net at the end.</p>
        <p>Agassi won the title here in 1992, reached the final in 1999 and the semifinals in 1995, 2000 and 2002. But in 14 appearances at the All England Club, he had never come across a player who represented quite as potent a cocktail of offense and defense as Nadal.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I ever got to deuce on his serve, so that's a problem,'' Agassi said. ''His movement is just out of this world.''</p>
        <p>In the first-set tie breaker, Agassi took a 5-2 lead, but Nadal reeled off the next 5 points with Agassi making a critical mistake at 5-4 by hooking a short and straightforward forehand wide. Agassi will head home to Las Vegas to prepare for the hardcourt season and retirement. He said he would miss the people at Wimbledon the most.</p>
        <p>''Through the years, I've seen them sit through some tough conditions just to see a few minutes of play,'' Agassi said. ''Whether they're queuing up on the outside or sitting with their umbrellas in Center Court, you know it's quite a love for the sport. That's what separates this from every other event.''</p>
