        <p>Next weekend a couple of overstuffed concerts take over the city. One is a New York tradition. And the other definitely isn't.</p>
        <p>The New York tradition is the SIREN MUSIC FESTIVAL, presented by The Village Voice, which will swamp Coney Island for the sixth year on Saturday. The festival, as always, is free and packed full of indie rock acts. One of the oddest things about Siren is that it scarcely seems to reflect the musical or demographic diversity of the city's music scene, even the city's downtown music scene. And compared with the three major indie-rock festivals that will hit Chicago this summer (the recent Intonation, along with the forthcoming Pitchfork and Lollapalooza), this one seems slightly lacking in big names.</p>
        <p>Then again, Siren is free, and surely the pink-skinned, glassy-eyed fans staggering down the boardwalk won't be in a mood to complain. This year's headliners include the petulant Canadian indie-pop act STARS, the blithe and absurd British band ART BRUT, the exuberant neo-glam band SCISSOR SISTERS and SHE WANTS REVENGE, the shameless Los Angeles gloom-pop band. (You'd think a self-respecting New York audience would boo those guys off the stage.) The full schedule is at villagevoice.com/siren.</p>
        <p>The other, distinctly nontraditional New York concert is KENNY CHESNEY's current tour, which is to touch down at Madison Square Garden on Friday. Mr. Chesney is a laid-back country singer whose obvious influences include Jimmy Buffett and James Taylor; his radio-ready hits (he recently topped the country charts with a sweet, straightforward song called ''Summertime'') and exuberant arena shows have made him one of the country's most popular singers, though he rarely plays Manhattan. On Friday he is to be joined by DIERKS BENTLEY (whose hits include the shrugging break-up song, ''Settle for a Slowdown'') and the ''American Idol'' winner CARRIE UNDERWOOD, who established herself as a country-pop star with the smash ''Jesus, Take the Wheel.'' The concert is sold out, but resourceful New Yorkers should be able to figure out a way in.</p>
