        <p>For 400 years, it took days on foot to reach the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. Then, about a century ago, travelers were offered the option of taking a four-hour train ride instead. Now there's yet another way.</p>
        <p>Inkaterra, a Peruvian ecotourism company, started a helicopter service from Cuzco to Machu Picchu in May. The 30-minute flight whisks passengers to the helipad at the Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, about a 20-minute drive from the ruins. Rates begin at $895 a person for a one-day excursion, based on the number of passengers, and include a guided tour of the ruins and lunch at the hotel. Overnight trips are also available.</p>

        <p>Another company had offered helicopter flights, but the government wouldn't renew its contract because of complaints by environmentalists and local residents about noise and pollution.</p>
        <p>Inkaterra said it uses five-passenger low-noise Alouette helicopters on its flights. To make reservations, call (800) 442-5042 or visit www.inkaterra.com.</p>
