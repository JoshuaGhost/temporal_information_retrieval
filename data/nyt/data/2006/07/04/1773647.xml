        <p>If a list were made of the great biologists of the past 100 years, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard would certainly be on it.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, she and Eric F. Wieschaus solved one of the central mysteries of life: how the genes in a fertilized egg direct the formation of an embryo. For their discovery, Dr. Nüsslein-Volhard, Dr. Wieschaus and Edward B. Lewis received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Nüsslein-Volhard was just the 10th woman to win a Nobel Prize in one of the sciences.</p>

        <p>If a list were made of the great biologists of the past 100 years, Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard would certainly be on it.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, she and Eric F. Wieschaus solved one of the central mysteries of life: how the genes in a fertilized egg direct the formation of an embryo. For their discovery, Dr. Nüsslein-Volhard, Dr. Wieschaus and Edward B. Lewis received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Nüsslein-Volhard was just the 10th woman to win a Nobel Prize in one of the sciences.</p>
        <p>Now 63, she directs the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany. In her off-hours, she works to improve the status of women in science.</p>
        <p>With her own money and a $100,000 award from Unesco-L'Oréal's Women in Science Program, she has organized the Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard Foundation, which offers grants to young female scientists for baby sitters and household help.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nüsslein-Volhard was New York last month to talk about her Kales Press book ''Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development.''</p>
        <p>Q. Grants for baby sitters and housecleaners? Is this the kind of foundation a male Nobel Prize winner could have thought of?</p>
        <p>A. No one thought of it! (Laughs) Not even non-Nobel prize winners!</p>
        <p>I am often asked why there is discrimination against women in science. And I have given it some thought. With prejudicial attitudes, you can't really do much. You can point out when people discriminate and ask them not to. At the Max Planck Institute, we made a little pamphlet telling the men when they do it, because they often don't know.</p>
        <p>In German science, we have a special problem. We lose talented women at the time they get pregnant. Some of it occurs because they are encouraged -- by their husbands, bosses and the government -- to take long maternity leaves.</p>
        <p>Germanic thinking has it that children can only be properly brought up if the actual mother is cleaning and picking up. Many stop their research for two or three years. Later, these young women find it difficult to get back. They drop out.</p>
        <p>Q. And how does a $400-a-month grant plug a brain drain?</p>
        <p>A. We try to find the gifted ones, where it would be a real pity if they dropped out. We say: use these funds to buy yourself time away from household matters. We still expect they'll work full-time and get day care for the kids. This is meant to ease the extra workload they have because of children.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you experience gender bias when you were a student?</p>
        <p>A. I didn't have children. But when I finished my doctoral thesis, it was published and I was only listed as the second author. The boss at the laboratory where I worked said: ''Let this man be first author. He started the project and has family, and he needs his career.''</p>
        <p>I had done almost all the work. And yet, I agreed! I could still foam: I get so angry about it.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you foam last year when Lawrence Summers, then the president of Harvard, suggested that women were less likely to have ''an intrinsic aptitude'' for scientific careers?</p>
        <p>A. He missed the point. In mathematics and science, there is no difference in the intelligence of men and women. The difference in genes between men and women is simply the Y chromosome, which has nothing to do with intelligence.</p>
        <p>What troubles me is that some might think: ''Well, if the president of Harvard says this, it must be true. He's just being attacked because he said something politically incorrect.'' What Summers said was scientifically incorrect.</p>
        <p>Q. When you made your Nobel discovery, was there a moment when you felt: ''Aha, I have changed what humans know about nature?''</p>
        <p>A. At the time we did the experiments, Eric Wieschaus and I knew the work was important. Nonetheless, one always struggles with whether the experiment is right.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you describe your Nobel experiments in lay terms?</p>
        <p>A. We first bred a large number of fruit fly families where just one gene was absent. If an embryo did not develop a head or a gut, we could then say, ''This gene is important for the shape of a head or a gut.'' In our first published paper, we described 20 or so ''control genes'' affecting the subdivision of the embryo's body into regions. Using what were then newly developed technologies, we and others then isolated the genes.</p>
        <p>We figured out what they did biochemically and how they interacted.</p>
        <p>The sum was: We developed a detailed understanding of how an embryo's shape is determined by genes. We found many of these genes were similar to those implicated in human genetic diseases. This was not anticipated by us but was important for the Nobel Prize, I think.</p>
        <p>Q. Your country is being led by a Ph.D. physicist. Do you think Chancellor Angela Merkel's election has improved the status of German women in science?</p>
        <p>A. It might be of influence. I am happy that she is there because she understands science outside of ideology. In the Green Party and among some in the Socialist Party, there are people who are anti-science. They are against genetically modified foods and atomic energy. She sees through it, and maybe this will help.</p>
        <p>Another thing, we have since 1990 this Embryo Protection Law, which says that eggs are human beings from the time of fertilization. Cells in a Petri dish are considered the same as a full human!</p>
        <p>Q. Is Germany's embryo-protection law a reaction to the pseudo-science of the Nazi period when physicians performed experiments on concentration camp prisoners?</p>
        <p>A. It's probably the reason why German research laws are so restrictive -- just to be on the ''safe'' side. If the people don't understand stem cells or gene diagnosis, they say, ''Let's make laws that make it impossible that something bad can happen.''</p>
        <p>Q. You were born in 1942. Did you ever speak with your parents about their activities in the Nazi years?</p>
        <p>A. Nearly everyone in my age group had those conversations with their teachers -- though often the parents would not speak about it. In my family, we talked. They were not heroes, but it was O.K. They were not in the Nazi Party. My grandfather was dismissed from his job because he was not in the party. Also, he hid Jews. And one aunt was put in a concentration camp.</p>
        <p>One of my colleagues is a nephew of Dietrich Bonhoeffer [the anti-Hitler resistance leader]. What we observed, with consternation, is the way people tried to live normal lives.</p>
        <p>When you read letters between my mother and father while he was at the front, it's about where to get food and knitting a pullover for ''Little Janni.'' After the war, my mother was in a group of women with Emmi Bonhoeffer [Bonhoeffer's sister-in-law].</p>
        <p>They helped refugees from Auschwitz give testimony against those who ran the concentration camps. My mother told us there were things from that time she felt awful about and she had to do some good.</p>
        <p>Q. It's often said that artistic work and scientific inquiry are similar. Do you find it so?</p>
        <p>A. Yes and no. It is certainly a creative act to understand phenomena in nature. But after some time, scientific discoveries no longer depend on the personality of the scientist. Whoever discovered the double helix, it is true. It doesn't matter whether Watson and Crick discovered it, or Rosalind Franklin. Yet, no matter how much time passes, Mozart is still Mozart.</p>
        <p>Q. Every article I've read about you mentions that you bake an incredible chocolate cake. Why is that?</p>
        <p>A. It's true! They want to make sure ''she's still a woman.'' There is terrible prejudice against women who are successful. If she's beautiful, she must be stupid. And if a woman is smart, she must be ugly -- or nasty. I think it makes some people feel better to learn I bake good chocolate cake.</p>
