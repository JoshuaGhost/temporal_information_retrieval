        <p>FLIGHTS ARE PACKED -- If you haven't made summer travel plans yet, you could be out of luck. The summer travel season has started with airlines reporting record load factors, or the percentage of seats filled with paying customers. Here are the figures for June from the top six airlines: The load factor at United Airlines was 88.3 percent, the highest ever. The load factor at Delta Air Lines was 84.6 percent, largely driven by a 30.6 percent increase in international passengers over June 2005; on June 30, Delta's flights were 94.4 percent full -- the highest daily load factor ever, the airline said. The June load factor at US Airways was 84.3 percent, and at Northwest Airlines, it was 89.7 percent, also the highest ever. At Continental Airlines, the June figure was 84.8 percent. But at Southwest Airlines, by comparison, the load factor was a relatively roomy 73.8 percent. Meanwhile, flight delays are mounting. The 20 top domestic carriers achieved an overall on-time arrival rate of 78.3 percent in May, compared with 83.7 percent in May 2005, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Transportation Department. At the same time, airlines have fewer employees to handle increased business. In April, domestic airlines employed 4.8 percent fewer workers than in April 2005; that means April 2006 was the 16th consecutive month that the work force was lower than in the year-ago month, the bureau said.</p>
        <p>LESS ROOM, MORE MONEY AT THE INN -- Hotel rooms are going to be harder to find and they are going to cost more this summer than last, according to PKF Hospitality Research, which says domestic hotel occupancy rates are likely to average nearly 74.1 percent, the highest level since 1997. Room rates are forecast to be up 6 percent over last summer. And forget about just dropping in unexpectedly. ''It will be tough to find a hotel room during the summer of 2006 without booking in advance,'' said R. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research.</p>
        <p>TRANS-ATLANTIC BOOM -- With June load factors at 72 percent, the all-business-class carrier Eos Airlines said it was beginning a second daily flight in September from Kennedy International Airport to Stansted Airport in London. Eos, which began service last October, flies Boeing 757-200 aircraft, which typically hold 220 seats, configured with 48 premium lie-flat seats. Eos round-trip fares range from $2,950 for advance purchase to $6,500 walk-up (compared with more than $9,000 walk-up on major competitors). Reflecting the growing demand for New York-to-London service, British Airways said it was adding an eighth daily flight from Kennedy to Heathrow International Airport in December. British Air also has three daily flights serving Newark and Heathrow.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE -- Many corporations are evidently returning to a policy that was sharply curtailed in the years after 9/11 -- allowing their traveling employees to tack a little time onto business trips for personal pleasure. According to the latest National Business Travel Monitor, 44 percent of business travelers now agree that they ''extend business trips for pleasure purposes'' whenever possible. That's up from 40 percent this time last year, according to YPB&amp;R/Yankelovich, which publishes the monitor.</p>
        <p>NORTHWEST ELITE LANES -- Northwest has now joined several competitors and set aside special boarding lanes at departure gates for elite-status members of its WorldPerks frequent-flier program. The first-to-board lanes are also available to nonelite passengers with first class or World Business Class tickets, and to elite-status members of frequent flier programs of other airlines in the SkyTeam Alliance.</p>
        <p>COMPANION FLIERS -- Flying with a pet is, of course, infinitely more convenient on a private jet. Noting that many of its customers do take a pet along, NetJets, the leading fractional-share business jet company, has added a service giving domestic customers 24-hour telephone access for emergency or even general consultations with experts at the Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. NetJets said it flew nearly 10,000 pets on about 6,500 flights last year. Dogs and cats predominate, of course, but the pets have included a falcon, a wolf and a 250-pound kangaroo, said Maryann Aarseth, a NetJets spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>ONLINE HITS -- According to the online travel-data company Hitwise.com, these were the top 10 travel sites in May, ranked by the number of visits: MapQuest; Yahoo Maps; Expedia; Orbitz; Travelocity; Southwest Airlines; Cheap Tickets; Google Maps; Priceline; and Yahoo Travel.</p>
        <p>ET CETERA -- The most preferred hotel loyalty program in the world is Hilton HHonors, according to a survey of domestic and international travelers by Phoenix Marketing. But in the United States, Hilton HHonors shared the top-rated status with Marriott Rewards  JetBlue just started more new routes: Burbank-Orlando, Fla.; Burbank-Las Vegas; and Boston-Buffalo, as well as routes from Pittsburgh to Kennedy International Airport and Pittsburgh to Boston. In September, JetBlue plans to start three new daily nonstops from Kennedy to Hobby Airport in Houston, with introductory one-way fares of $99.</p>
