        <p>LEIBOWITZ - Simone. Be loved mother, wife, stepmother, mother - in - law, friend, died peacefully on July 13, 2006, at age 80. A woman of exceptional character, Simone illuminated lives from Egypt to Switzerland to New York City. Her career as a doctor gave way to her ultimate wishes for marriage and family when leaving Switzerland in 1969 for Queens, where she settled with her late husband Herman, raised her loving daughter Sandra and lived life on her terms. Her kindness, intelligence and spirit were well known by family, friends, neighbors and community, including those who knew her at the Hollis Hills Jewish Center, where she actively participated. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, July 16, at 10 am, at Schwartz Bros.-Jeffer Memorial Chapels, 114-03 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, NY. Donations to Calvary Hospital, which gave her superior care in her last days, are warmly appreciated.</p>
