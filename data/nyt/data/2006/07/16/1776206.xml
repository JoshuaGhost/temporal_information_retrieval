        <p>Greg Ansel, 37, a financial investor from Phoenix (with arm in air alongside two other amateur storm chasers and a guide): ''We're underneath a funnel cloud. This was the first time that we experienced a funnel cloud. I'd seen one a long time ago, when I was a little kid. That's what kind of got me interested in seeing tornadoes. I'm pointing up at the cloud, saying 'That thing is spinning. Is it O.K.? Is it safe to be here?' There were probably about 10 seconds where I wasn't thinking about the danger and I was just watching the beauty of it. And then lightning strikes somewhere and within a second the thunder hits, so you know it's really close and you wake up and go, 'O.K., wait a second.' ''</p>
