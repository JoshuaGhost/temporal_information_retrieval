        <p>WHAT do Mets fans and Yankees fans take from a high-octane three-game interleague series?</p>
        <p>The Yankees shut the Mets out on Friday, the Mets spanked the Yankees on Saturday, and the Yankees returned the favor last night, winning, 16-7. Six Mets were named to the National League All-Star team -- the highest total for the team since five were named in 1986, a year the Mets won the World Series.</p>

        <p>Fans stuffing the ballot box is not in the best interests of baseball.</p>

        <p>WHAT do Mets fans and Yankees fans take from a high-octane three-game interleague series?</p>
        <p>The Yankees shut the Mets out on Friday, the Mets spanked the Yankees on Saturday, and the Yankees returned the favor last night, winning, 16-7. Six Mets were named to the National League All-Star team -- the highest total for the team since five were named in 1986, a year the Mets won the World Series.</p>
        <p>Manager Willie Randolph celebrated the moment and acknowledged the achievement and said he was happiest for Jos√© Reyes and David Wright.</p>
        <p>''It's great for self-confidence,'' Randolph said. ''They'll get to be around some great players and hopefully start to think, 'Hey, I belong here.' ''</p>
        <p>Reyes and Wright definitely belong. But the process by which they and other starting All-Stars were selected needs to be overhauled. And we can start by taking the vote away from the fans.</p>
        <p>Fans are fickle, driven by emotion, not reason. Look at the ambivalence toward the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez, who has been pilloried by fans for everything from failing to hit in the clutch to, well, to being A-Rod.</p>
        <p>Last night, Rodriguez hit two home runs -- including a grand slam -- and the fans demanded two curtain calls. This kind of fan flip-flopping is repeated in ballparks across the nation. And when it comes to All-Star voting, fans can be particularly unreliable.</p>
        <p>This season, Pittsburgh Pirates fans were encouraged by the team and its broadcasters to stuff the ballot box. They obliged and were rewarded with one starter, Jason Bay.</p>
        <p>''I understand that the fans want to be involved in some ways, but I think that it becomes a popularity contest,'' Randolph said.</p>
        <p>''That's not right. I think to be an All-Star, you should be an All-Star -- not because your team draws well at home and you have a lot of home games early.''''</p>
        <p>Baseball needs to be Frick-ified.</p>
        <p>In 1957, Ford Frick, the baseball commissioner, stepped in after Cincinnati fans stuffed the ballot boxes and voted eight Reds to the N.L. starting lineup. Frick removed the Cincinnati players Gus Bell, George Crowe and Wally Post from the lineup, replacing them with Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I thought it was unfair,'' Crowe, a first baseman, said yesterday from his home in California, referring to Frick's decision. ''The fans voted me in, I thought I should have been there. My feelings weren't hurt. We had a system that was in place, and I thought they should have abided by it.''</p>
        <p>There is general disagreement about the best way to select the All-Star starters. I think the vote should be left to players and managers.</p>
        <p>But Derek Jeter, voted to his seventh All-Star Game, said he didn't think fellow players would be any fairer than fans. ''Even if the players did it, there would be favoritism, there would be people who maybe didn't like a certain player so they wouldn't vote for him,'' Jeter said. But pitcher Mike Mussina, who was not selected to the American League team, disagreed. He said fellow players would be more informed and evenhanded. ''I think the players would be fairer,'' he said. ''I think they would decide on people who are having good years.''</p>
        <p>Mussina acknowledged that some players resented and disliked others. ''But it's not widespread enough that if they deserved to go to the All-Star game, they wouldn't get to go,'' he said. ''Having the fans vote is just a popularity contest. It's not necessarily who's having the best year -- except for the pitchers -- pitchers have to earn their way. The other guys earn their way maybe two years ago or three years ago.''</p>
        <p>Even that's up for debate. Should a player be selected on what he has done in the past, or be rewarded -- like Wright and Reyes -- for having a strong first half?</p>
        <p>''I think if you're an All-Star and have been a perennial All-Star, even if you have somewhat of a slow start before the All-Star break, I still think you should make it if you are the best at that position,'' Randolph said.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to Alfonso Soriano of the Washington Nationals. Soriano was voted on the N.L. team as a left fielder. Here's a player who initially resisted playing that position. Today, Soriano, thanks to fan votes, is going.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he's an All-Star,'' Randolph said of Soriano. ''Offensively? Yes, but he's not an All-Star left fielder. I think to be an All-Star, I think you should be somewhat well rounded.</p>
        <p>''He might be a second baseman next year when he's a free agent. That's why I don't think the fans should vote, because they don't really know. They don't know talent, they don't know who can really play, they don't really know who deserves to be there. Coaches and players, even though sometimes you can be biased, have a better feel of who the true All-Stars are.''</p>
        <p>Enough stuffing the ballot box.</p>
        <p>Yes, the game is largely for the fans, so let the fans cheer and boo, let them fill hours upon hours of radio call-in shows. By all means, give the game back to the fans.</p>
        <p>Just let managers and players do the heavy lifting. Let them vote.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 15, 2006, Saturday  The Sports of The Times column on July 3 about fan voting for baseball's All-Star teams referred incorrectly to events in 1957, when Cincinnati fans stuffed the ballot boxes. Seven, not eight, players for the Reds were voted to the National League's lineup. Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals, not Cincinnati's George Crowe, won the balloting as the starting first baseman.</p>
