        <p>The main Sunni Arab political bloc began a boycott of Parliament on Sunday to protest the kidnapping of a Sunni legislator and threatened to withdraw its members from the prime minister's cabinet unless the lawmaker was freed within the next 48 hours.</p>
        <p>The walkout was the first serious disruption in Iraq's new government and reflected the fragility of the power-sharing arrangement in the face of the relentless sectarian violence overwhelming the nation.</p>
        <p>The legislator, Tayseer Najah al-Mashhadani, and eight of her guards were kidnapped by people suspected of being Shiite militiamen on Saturday while driving into Baghdad from her home north of the capital. Ms. Mashhadani's party, the Iraqi Islamic Party, belongs to the Iraqi Consensus Front, the umbrella Sunni bloc that holds 44 of the Parliament's 275 seats and has often criticized the Shiite-led government security forces.</p>
        <p>In a similar attack on Sunday, officials said, gunmen ambushed a convoy carrying a Shiite legislator as it drove through a region south of Baghdad where the Sunni-led insurgency has fought regularly with government forces. The legislator, Laqa al-Yaseen, escaped unharmed, though eight of her guards were abducted and two were wounded in a shootout, said Shatha al-Musawi, another Shiite member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>No one has claimed responsibility for either attack.</p>
        <p>The Sunni bloc said it would continue the boycott until Ms. Mashhadani was released. Sunni politicians have occasionally used walkouts as a form of political protest, most notably during negotiations over the constitution last year, and during a wave of attacks on Sunni mosques after the bombing of a prominent Shiite shrine in February.</p>
        <p>Representatives of Shiite and Kurdish political factions, perhaps in an effort to avert a crisis, expressed guarded support on Sunday for the Sunni bloc's concerns over security and its demand that Ms. Mashhadani be released.</p>
        <p>Mahdi al-Hafidh, a Shiite legislator, said in a speech to Parliament that he ''heartily'' backed the Sunni bloc's condemnation of the kidnapping, but he suggested that a walkout was not the best solution to the problem. ''When I talk to the brothers in the Iraqi Consensus Front and they want to pull out, against whom are you doing that?'' Mr. Hafidh asked. ''We have to work together.''</p>
        <p>Also on Sunday, the national security adviser issued the country's first most wanted list, which included 41 criminal suspects and was topped by Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, a deputy of Saddam Hussein and one of the Iraqis whose faces were printed on a deck of cards issued by the American military three years ago. Mr. Douri is the highest ranking former Iraqi official still believed to be on the run.</p>
        <p>The list included Mr. Hussein's eldest daughter, Raghad, who lives in Jordan, where she was granted asylum; Mr. Hussein's first wife, Sajida Khairalla Tulfa; other senior members of Mr. Hussein's now-outlawed Baath Party; and militants linked to Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>''These are the culprits of most of the explosions and random killings intended to cause harm to the Iraqi people and spark sectarian war between Sunnis and Shiites,'' Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser, said at a news conference. ''You will see that they belong to all sects in Iraq, all ethnic minorities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Douri became the country's most-wanted man after the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia who was killed in an American airstrike last month. Mr. Zarqawi's replacement, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, known sometimes as Sheik Abu Hamza al-Muhajer, also appeared on the list.</p>
        <p>Iraqi and American authorities announced on Sunday that Mr. Zarqawi's body had been buried in a secret grave after the American military handed it over to the Iraqi government. An American military spokesman said via an e-mail message that the remains had been buried ''in accordance with Muslim customs and traditions.''</p>
        <p>Among the acts of violence that rattled the country on Sunday, a bomb exploded just before sundown at the main market in Mahmudiya, a violent, predominantly Sunni town south of Baghdad, killing at least 5 people and wounding at least 22, the police there reported.</p>
        <p>The blast occurred came a day after a suicide car bomb tore through a bustling street market in a Shiite slum in Baghdad, killing at least 62 people and wounding nearly 120, in the deadliest insurgent assault since the new Shiite-led government was installed in May.</p>
        <p>In the northern oil town of Kirkuk, a bomb planted in a road exploded near an American military patrol on Sunday, wounding three American soldiers, said Capt. Mahmoud Abdullah of the Iraqi Police.</p>
