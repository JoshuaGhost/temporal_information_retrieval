        <p>Q. Eight years ago, I planted Oriental poppies in the front of a border. Then I discovered they die back in midsummer. I didn't want to try to fill the hole they left, so I moved them. Then I moved them again, and again. Each time, poppies reappeared in the old spot. Although they are beautiful, enough is enough. How do I get them to stop?</p>
        <p>A. It sounds as though you have the old-fashioned species Papaver orientale, the bright orange ones with the black blotches at the throat. They self-sow madly when given full sun, well-drained soil, cold winters and cool springs. And even small bits of root can send up healthy plants.</p>

        <p>Q. Eight years ago, I planted Oriental poppies in the front of a border. Then I discovered they die back in midsummer. I didn't want to try to fill the hole they left, so I moved them.

        <p>A. It sounds as though you have the old-fashioned species Papaver orientale, the bright orange ones with the black blotches at the throat. They self-sow madly when given full sun, well-drained soil, cold winters and cool springs. And even small bits of root can send up healthy plants.</p>
        <p>To stop them, pull them as weeds in spring and plant something else in their place. New babies will sprout in late summer, but if they come up under a nice fat hosta, aster or day lily, they are unlikely to get enough light to survive.</p>
        <p>To replace them, consider planting a named variety like tall, salmon-pink Princess Victoria Louise, or the striking white Royal Wedding. If space is tight, there is Pizzicato, a semidwarf that comes in the full range of Oriental poppy colors: red, orange, pink and white.</p>
        <p>Most of the named Orientals are hybrids that bloom slightly longer than the species before dying back. And although they are robust enough to make large clumps and spread, they are usually less determined to return uninvited.</p>

        <p>Q. Are there plants that thrive on, or at least don't mind, all the nitrogen that comes with frequent applications of dog urine?</p>
        <p>A. Sorry, no such luck. Even nitrogen hogs like grass resent having this nutrient applied directly, over and over. If you have a lot of patience, you can try training your pet to use just one inconspicuous spot. But generally speaking, if the yard is small enough to suffer nitrogen overload, it is too small to be an alternative to walking the dog.</p>
