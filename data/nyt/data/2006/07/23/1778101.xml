        <p>Just a week after a tornado swept through Greenwich, more severe weather hit Connecticut.</p>
        <p>A heat wave led to record electricity usage two days in a row and caused scattered power failures throughout the state. Heat-related illnesses also sent some people to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Temperatures reached 94 degrees in Greenwich on Monday and 95 in Greens Farms on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, and many people sought refuge indoors from the heat and humidity.</p>
        <p>The peak power consumption, 27,395 megawatts, in New England on Tuesday afternoon was the highest level recorded, said Erin O'Brien, a spokeswoman for I.S.O. New England, which oversees the power supply generated by 350 energy plants to New England homes and businesses. In Connecticut, the power-generation numbers on Tuesday broke a record that was set on Monday, said Mitch Gross, a spokesman for Connecticut Light and Power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gross said a small percentage of the company's nearly 1.2 million customers in Connecticut experienced scattered power shutdowns during the heat wave. In Stamford, for instance, 5,000 customers lost power for an hour Monday night, he said.</p>
        <p>United Illuminating customers also experienced failures, with about 2,000 losing power on Monday and Tuesday. On Tuesday night, thunderstorms hit the region, and at their height, 20,300 customers lost power, said Al Carbone, a spokesman for United Illuminating.</p>
        <p>The Greenwich Hospital emergency room saw an influx of patients suffering heat-related ailments, said George Pawlush, a spokesman for the hospital. On Monday and Tuesday, about 20 percent more patients came into the emergency room than usual, he said. Many had previous lung problems. None had life-threatening injuries or illnesses, he said.</p>
