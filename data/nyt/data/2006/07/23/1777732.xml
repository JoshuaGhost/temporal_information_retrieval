        <p>Meryl Gordon, 41, former vice president for business affairs of USA Network: ''This was my first evening in Koh Tao. I'm the floating head on the right; also in the picture is a Scandinavian woman I met in the water. The island was paradise -- but my accommodations were decidedly not. My bungalow had no electricity -- hence no air-conditioning or fan at the height of the Thai summer heat. I thought I'd have just enough time to enjoy the water before sunset. The warm, inviting ocean saturated me with calm and peace and tranquillity. I stayed longer and longer, far after sunset. It was cooling down quite a bit. Finally I realized I was staying in the water longer simply for fear of how cold I would be when I got out! I had no towel or clothes with me, and my bungalow was set back away from the beach. Finally, I steeled myself and stood up. It was freezing! I ran back to my bungalow, to my towel, to my sarong, and this time around the hot, stuffy bungalow didn't seem so bad.''</p>
