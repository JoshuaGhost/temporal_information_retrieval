        <p>In their 13 years together, Matthew Malin, left, and Andrew Goetz have always appreciated, even celebrated, how little they have in common. ''We're opposites in every way,'' said Mr. Malin, 38. ''Andrew loves to cook, and I hate to cook. He loves to clean, I hate it. He's opinionated, I'm diplomatic. He's Jewish, and I'm Christian.'' The main inspiration for the couple's streamlined unisex skin care line, Malin &amp; Goetz, was yet another yin and yang. ''Andrew has oily skin and mine is dry,'' Mr. Malin said. ''We wanted to create products we could both use.''</p>
        <p>The men share facial cleanser, but not shopping habits. Mr. Malin, who has been a buyer at Barneys and developed beauty products for Prada and Helmut Lang, is a fashion fanatic. ''I could have a thousand coats, bags and shoes,'' he said. ''I like anything that makes me look thin.''</p>

        <p>The men share facial cleanser, but not shopping habits. Mr. Malin, who has been a buyer at Barneys and developed beauty products for Prada and Helmut Lang, is a fashion fanatic. ''I could have a thousand coats, bags and shoes,'' he said. ''I like anything that makes me look thin.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goetz, who previously worked in marketing at the modern furniture company Vitra, called himself impatient.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather shop once a season and get it over with. But I could have a million pairs of sneakers.'' On a recent day outside their Chelsea shop with their dogs Junior, left, and Bob, Mr. Goetz combined a vintage T-shirt with vintage Gucci trousers and Puma sneakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malin wore an Earnest Sewn shirt, Helmut Lang pants and Converse sneakers. Mr. Goetz often dips into Mr. Malin's T-shirt collection and gladly takes hand-me-downs, but otherwise there is no wardrobe overlap, Mr. Goetz said. ''Our closets are separate but equal.''</p>
