        <p>Two men were killed in unrelated shootings on Brooklyn streets on Friday night. One was in a wheelchair, and the other was beaten before an attacker shot him, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the first shooting, about 7:25 p.m., in front of 140 Tapscott Street, in Brownsville, a 33-year-old man, whom the police did not identify, was chased by three men who beat him, the police said. At least one of the men then shot the man, who had a long history of arrests for mostly minor crimes, a law enforcement official said.</p>
