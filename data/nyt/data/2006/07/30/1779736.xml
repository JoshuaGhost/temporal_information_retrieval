        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Woods Plays Cautiously, and Frees Up Emotions'' (July 25): Much has been written about Tiger Woods's victory in the British Open and its historical significance, and the death of his father. As a psychotherapist working primarily with men with substance-abuse issues, I have a different, much more appreciative view.</p>
        <p>It is generally agreed that, for the most part, men have difficulty expressing their emotions. Emotions, however, will be expressed either outwardly (through sports, violent behavior or substance abuse) or inwardly (high blood pressure, ulcers).</p>
        <p>On the 18th green last Sunday, Woods modeled for all children (especially boys) one way a man can express joy, grief, sadness, relief and no doubt a variety of other feelings. In effect, he said it was O.K. to cry.</p>
        <p>I cannot imagine a more powerful example for today's youth and a more beneficial gift to male-kind and the world.</p>
