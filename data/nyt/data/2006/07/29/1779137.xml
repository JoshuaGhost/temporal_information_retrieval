        <p>A severe thunderstorm with strong winds and heavy rain swept through the New York metropolitan region yesterday afternoon, downing trees, causing power failures in thousands of homes and killing a 54-year-old woman who was struck by lightning on a golf course in Orange County.</p>
        <p>The storm, which began pounding the Northeast about 2 p.m. yesterday, caught the area off guard, causing about 200 lightning strikes and moving through with winds approaching 50 miles an hour, according to AccuWeather. The storm traveled through so quickly -- in about five hours -- that it dropped less than two inches of rain in most places, meteorologists said.</p>

        <p>A severe thunderstorm with strong winds and heavy rain swept through the New York metropolitan region yesterday afternoon, downing trees, causing power failures in thousands of homes and killing a 54-year-old woman who was struck by lightning on a golf course in Orange County.</p>
        <p>The storm, which began pounding the Northeast about 2 p.m. yesterday, caught the area off guard, causing about 200 lightning strikes and moving through with winds approaching 50 miles an hour, according to AccuWeather. The storm traveled through so quickly -- in about five hours -- that it dropped less than two inches of rain in most places, meteorologists said.</p>
        <p>The woman who was killed in Orange County was playing golf at the Lake Osiris golf course in Montgomery, N.Y., at the time she was struck.</p>
        <p>The Police Department in Montgomery said that the woman was with a female golfing partner, also 54, about 2 p.m. when the rain started. The two women sought shelter in a small, wooden shed near the 15th hole. As they were sitting on a bench inside the shed, lightning struck a tree nearby, traveled through the ground and entered both women's bodies, Sgt. Alex Landolina said.</p>
        <p>The woman who survived was briefly knocked unconscious and later complained of queasiness and numbness in her hands. She was taken to St. Luke's Cornwell Hospital in Newburgh, where she was in stable condition last night.</p>
        <p>''She doesn't remember or recall anything at all about the accident,'' Sergeant Landolina said.</p>
        <p>Both women are from Orange County, but their names were not released by the police as of last night.</p>
        <p>The death came one week after two teenagers were killed in Montvale, N.J., when they were struck lightning while playing soccer.</p>
        <p>Across the region yesterday, the storm also knocked down hundreds of trees, caused flooding and snapped numerous power lines. In New Jersey, one of the hardest-hit areas, more than 9,800 customers were left without power after a substation shut down in the Passaic, said Nancy Tucker, a spokeswoman with Public Service Electric and Gas. About 12,000 customers over all sustained power failures across New Jersey, but power was expected to be fully restored by the end of the night.</p>
        <p>At the height of the storm, about 2,400 customers also lost power on Staten Island, and 600 others in Westchester -- mostly in Yonkers. All of those customers were expected to have power restored by today.</p>
        <p>The storm also caused delays of up to three hours at the region's major airports.</p>
        <p>Brian Lasorsa, a meteorologist for AccuWeather, said the storm was caused by a weak cool front that combined with warm and humid air. It began in eastern Pennsylvania and traveled through New York and New Jersey before heading north into New England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasorsa said another less powerful storm was likely to hit the region tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''There will be another disturbance,'' he said, ''but it doesn't look quite as strong.''</p>
