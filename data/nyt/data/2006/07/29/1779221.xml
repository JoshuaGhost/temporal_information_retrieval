        <p>Torrential rain in northeast Ohio that began falling Thursday morning forced hundreds of people to evacuate their homes and businesses. Houses were submerged, and the town of Fairport Harbor, on Lake Erie, was nearly surrounded by rising water. The rain started about 11 a.m. Thursday. By dawn, 9.7 inches had fallen over most of Lake County, the Weather Service reported. That was almost five times more than a normal heavy rain for the area, the Weather Service said. No deaths or serious injuries were reported. But emergency crews in Eastlake were searching the banks of the Chagrin River for a marina worker last seen moving equipment at 3 a.m., just before the heaviest rain hit.</p>
