        <p>Five American films will be in competition at the Venice International Film Festival from Aug. 30 to Sept. 9. Now in its 63rd year, the festival is opening with the premiere of Brian De Palma's ''Black Dahlia,'' an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel about the murder of a young Hollywood actress. It stars Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson, below, who was a jury member in 2004. Another film about the pitfalls of celluloid celebrity, Allen Coulter's ''Hollywoodland,'' will be in competition for the Golden Lion, the festival's highest prize. ''Hollywoodland,'' about the mysterious death of George Reeves, who played Superman in the 1950's television series, stars Adrien Brody, Diane Lane, Ben Affleck and Bob Hoskins. The other American films in competition are ''The Fountain,'' directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz; Emilio Estevez's ''Bobby,'' about the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, with Sharon Stone and Anthony Hopkins; and Alfonso Cuarón's ''Children of Men,'' with Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine. Oliver Stone, David Lynch and Neil LaBute are showing films out of competition, and Ethan Hawke and Spike Lee will have pictures at ''Horizons,'' a program focused on new trends.</p>
