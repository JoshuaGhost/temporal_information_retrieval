        <p>Johnny Damon, the Yankees' unlikely first baseman, spotted Melky Cabrera's helmet behind the joyous throng around home plate at 12:38 this morning. Cabrera had flung it to the sky, and Damon found it and spiked it to the grass. The celebration was on.</p>
        <p>Cabrera's line-drive homer leading off the bottom of the 11th inning ended a game that had gone from mundane to wild to downright weird. The Yankees came back to beat the Seattle Mariners, 5-4, with a strange defensive alignment carrying them through the final two innings.</p>
        <p>Cabrera connected on a 2-1 slider from Julio Mateo, sending it just over the fence down the right-field line. As he touched first base, Cabrera threw his arms in the air in joy. It was his fourth career homer, the first to end a game, and it kept the Yankees a half-game behind Boston in the American League East.</p>
        <p>As a storm shook the Bronx around 10 p.m., the Yankees mounted a rally nearly as furious. The Yankees sent six batters to the plate before rain delayed the game 118 minutes.</p>
        <p>After midnight, and after a strikeout by Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees took the field with a center fielder playing first base and a first baseman playing second.</p>
        <p>Damon took over at first, wearing a first baseman's glove of unknown origin; the Yankees have no left-handed first basemen. Andy Phillips, who played second base in the minors but never for the Yankees, shifted to second.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did this to preserve Jason Giambi as the designated hitter. Had they shifted Giambi to first, the pitcher would have entered the lineup, and the Yankees had no bench players left.</p>
        <p>Kyle Farnsworth, whose fastball reached 101 miles an hour on the stadium radar gun, retired the side in order in the 10th. The second batter of the inning, José López, grounded to Phillips, who threw to Damon at first for the out. Scott Proctor worked a scoreless 11th for the victory.</p>
        <p>The Yankees trailed, 4-2, entering the bottom of the ninth. Phillips led off the inning with an inside-out double over first base. After Cabrera struck out on a hard splitter from the right-hander J. J. Putz, Manager Joe Torre sent Aaron Guiel in to bat for Nick Green.</p>
        <p>Green had gone 3 for 3, but he bats right-handed and Guiel bats lefty. The Yankees had no infielders remaining on the bench. Guiel grounded a single to right, scoring Phillips to make it 4-3.</p>
        <p>Bubba Crosby ran for Guiel and Jorge Posada batted next. Putz threw a wild pitch with the wet ball, and Posada soon sent a grounder toward the glove hand of López, the second baseman. López gathered it on the grass, rolled and set himself for a throw to first.</p>
        <p>Replays clearly showed Posada to be out by half a step. But the first-base umpire, Mike Reilly, yanked his arms to call Posada safe. That prompted an argument from Mariners Manager Mike Hargrove, who was ejected.</p>
        <p>With runners at the corners, Damon flied to center, scoring Crosby to tie the score, 4-4. Rodriguez batted next, getting a second chance after popping out with a runner on second in the seventh.</p>
        <p>Umpires suspended play with a 3-1 count on Rodriguez, and when the game resumed at 12:05 a.m., Mateo had taken the mound. Few fans remained from the paid crowd of 52,992, and fans chanted ''A-Rod! A-Rod!'' Two pitches later, Rodriguez struck out.</p>
        <p>Hours earlier, starter Sidney Ponson had made a solid debut for the Yankees in the role of fifth starter. He lasted six and two-thirds innings -- longer than one Yankees starter, Jaret Wright, has lasted in a game all season -- and gave up four runs. Ponson allowed five hits and three walks, striking out five, and presumably earned himself another start.</p>
        <p>''Sure, he wants to impress everyone, but he needs to just do what he does,'' Torre said before the game, adding that his mental image of Ponson was positive: quick innings, few pitches, lots of ground balls.</p>
        <p>''He's a little bit like Wang,'' Torre said, referring to the Yankees' ground-ball specialist, Chien-Ming Wang. ''He doesn't necessarily strike people out. He'll throw pitches down in the zone and they'll swing at them.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ponson came into the game with an 80-95 career record, including 4-4 with a 5.24 earned run average for St. Louis this season. He was designated for assignment on July 7 and signed by the Yankees seven days later.</p>
        <p>Ponson has spent most of his career with the Baltimore Orioles, who terminated his contract last season after his third arrest for drunken driving. Ponson, who has also battled weight problems, has said he no longer drinks.</p>
        <p>Once a hard thrower, Ponson, 29, explained his pitching philosophy this way: ''I haven't seen a ground ball leave the park yet. When I do give them up, I give them up a long ways.''</p>
        <p>The last part of that comment accurately described the first inning. Ponson got only one ground ball, but he gave up a three-run homer to Richie Sexson.</p>
        <p>The runners on base had reached on walks, first to Ichiro Suzuki, then to López.</p>
        <p>But after Sexson's two-out homer, Ponson settled down. Through four innings, he had allowed no hits besides the home run.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Reliever Octavio Dotel threw one inning, allowing a hit and striking out two, for Class AA Trenton last night. Dotel, the former Houston and Oakland closer who had reconstructive elbow surgery in June 2005, will pitch later this week for Class A Staten Island. If all goes well, he will join the Yankees during their seven-game trip, which starts tomorrow.</p>
