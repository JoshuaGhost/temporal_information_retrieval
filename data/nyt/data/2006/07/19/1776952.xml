        <p>Theodore Roosevelt was a quotable man, and Jerome Alden's ''Bully'' takes advantage of that.</p>
        <p>''It's 1912, and the century's already getting away from us,'' Roosevelt says near the beginning of the play. At the end of the first act he announces, ''There comes a time in a man's life when he must rise above principle.''</p>

        <p>Theodore Roosevelt was a quotable man, and Jerome Alden's ''Bully'' takes advantage of that.</p>
        <p>''It's 1912, and the century's already getting away from us,'' Roosevelt says near the beginning of the play. At the end of the first act he announces, ''There comes a time in a man's life when he must rise above principle.''</p>
        <p>James Whitmore played the role in ''Bully,'' a one-man show, when it had a brief run at the 46th Street Theater on Broadway in 1977. William Walsh is taking it on now in a modest new production at the Irish Arts Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh is determined to make his Roosevelt impression convincing, and he succeeds (even though he is fashionably slimmer than his subject). But there is a side effect: the speech pattern he adopts leaves some words almost unintelligible. Mr. Walsh also had some difficulty with his lines at a recent performance, but he has admirable stage presence.</p>
        <p>''Bully,'' subtitled ''The Life and Times of Theodore Roosevelt,'' covers most of the highlights in Roosevelt's life. At one point he holds a teddy bear (named for him after he declined to shoot a cub, according to one version of the story), and he talks about being a sickly boy who was tutored at home before attending Harvard. In 1880 he went into New York politics and married Alice Hathaway Lee, who died four years later after giving birth to their daughter, Alice; Roosevelt's mother died on the same day.</p>
        <p>He was bored to tears as vice president; then, in 1901, William McKinley was assassinated, making Roosevelt, at 42, the youngest president in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>Act II covers his founding of the Progressive Party; an assassination attempt, after which he simply got up and made his speech as planned (''It takes more than that to kill a bull moose''); World War I, and the war death of his son Quentin. Within a year, Roosevelt died, at Sagamore Hill, his home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Mr. Alden, some of his wisdom lives on.</p>
        <p>''Bully'' continues through Sunday at the Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444.</p>
