        <p>The Supreme Court decision striking down the use of military commissions to bring terrorism detainees to trial has set off sharp differences among Republicans in Congress over what kind of rights detainees should be granted and how much deference should be shown the president in deciding the issue.</p>
        <p>The debate is expected to consume the rest of the summer in Congress as lawmakers head into an election season expected to be dominated by issues of national security. The issue reflects the difficult legal, diplomatic and political choices the government faces in dealing with terrorism suspects.</p>
        <p>The divisions do not fall strictly along traditional partisan lines and are as much within the parties as between them, particularly for Republicans. On one side of the debate are Republicans who believe Congress should give the president the authority to set up the kind of military commissions that were struck down by the court. Such commissions would sharply curtail defendants' rights.</p>
        <p>On the other side are those who say the trials should be modeled on the military system of courts-martial, an approach that would give detainees more due-process rights than would the commissions. In between, many Republicans and Democrats alike argue for starting with the military judicial system and tweaking it to reflect the differences of trying terrorism suspects.</p>
        <p>The debate will play out in a series of Congressional hearings quickly scheduled for this week, as lawmakers return to Washington after their weeklong Fourth of July recess.</p>
        <p>Aides to President Bush said they had not yet reached any conclusions about what legislation should look like. Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush, said lawyers for the White House, State Department and Justice Department were still reviewing the court's decision in the case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.</p>
        <p>Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is expected to take a leading role on the issue as a member of the Armed Services Committee, argued that the administration's version of the military commissions had to be ''reined in'' to make clear, for instance, that evidence gathered by coercive interrogation techniques could not be introduced as evidence.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to get my colleagues to think about the international community's reception to what we do,'' said Mr. Graham, a former military lawyer. ''We've got a chance to improve our image.''</p>
        <p>In its decision, the Supreme Court said, on a 5-to-3 vote, that the planned commissions were unauthorized by federal statute and violated international law.</p>
        <p>Administration officials, who have been consulting with Mr. Graham, are looking to him to play a central part in drafting legislation. Senators John W. Warner of Virginia, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and John McCain of Arizona also are expected to be at the forefront for the Republicans, while Senator Carl Levin of Michigan is quite likely to emerge as a point man for the Democrats.</p>
        <p>On the Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Republican chairman, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the committee's ranking Democrat, who first proposed Congressional action on military tribunals in 2001, are also expected to play central roles.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision left lawmakers with the challenge of resolving a complicated legal issue under the pressure of a heated election season and a limited amount of time left on their calendar.</p>
        <p>While both parties are united in saying they want to act quickly, they face fights over what form of trial to use and whether the protections of the Geneva Conventions apply to terrorism suspects.</p>
        <p>In hearings on Capitol Hill this week, the House Armed Services Committee will take testimony from lawyers, including several sympathetic to the administration. Two Senate committees, Judiciary and Armed Services, will take testimony from constitutional lawyers and top military lawyers, who some Republican senators believe were ignored in the White House discussions that led to the establishment of commissions. The only administration officials scheduled to testify are lawyers from the Justice Department and the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>While Republicans are divided on central issues, Democrats have their own challenge. They see the court's decision as a rare rebuke to Mr. Bush, and they hope to turn the debate into a broader one over presidential power. But they said they also recognized that they must cooperate on legislation or risk being portrayed as weak on terrorism.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans and many Democrats say that the administration may have hurt itself by rebuffing efforts as early as 2001 by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to set up some kind of military commission. ''Congress is going to want to be a full partner, and not a rubber stamp for this process,'' said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close ally of the White House.</p>
        <p>The central question is what kind of forum to set up. Commissions allow the government wide berth in introducing evidence, including hearsay, which is banned in military courts, and restrict the rights of the accused to be present in the court and to see the evidence against them. Military courts-martial, while not as strict as civilian courts, restrict the kind of evidence that can be introduced and allow the accused to interview witnesses and see even classified evidence.</p>
        <p>The White House has long resisted anything like courts-martial, saying they could require the government to choose between dropping the charges and disclosing more than it wants to about the sources and nature of the intelligence used to develop a case against the detainees.</p>
        <p>Senator Warner, who will direct the hearings as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he wanted a system that relied ''as much as possible'' on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which the court decision said governed the treatment of detainees.</p>
        <p>Many lawmakers said they supported an approach based on some tweaking of the military system. Senators Graham and Specter, along with Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, advocate allowing hearsay, as well as a procedure to deal with classified evidence. The rules would be looser than in a court-martial but stricter than in a commission.</p>
        <p>''We have to have a system that operates in the war on terror and one that doesn't tie us into knots trying to prosecute the people who have killed Americans in large numbers,'' Mr. Hunter said.</p>
        <p>John C. Yoo, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked on orders expanding presidential power in the treatment of detainees as a former lawyer for the Justice Department, said, ''The debate that people are having is whether it's going to be a short bill that just overrules Hamdan completely, which you could do in one sentence, or whether it's going to be a much more comprehensive law that tries to set out essentially a code of procedure for the military commission.''</p>
        <p>But any effort simply to codify the president's order establishing commissions would be fiercely resisted by influential Democrats.</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court said the president cannot continue to break the law,'' said Mr. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat. ''The worst thing to do would be to simply paper that over and say we'll make it possible for him to break the law.''</p>
        <p>An effort by Mr. Leahy in 2001 to introduce legislation establishing tribunals was rebuffed by the White House. ''They said no, they knew what they were doing, they would do it alone,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''What's happened? Five years, there have been no trials, no convictions, nothing has happened, we've had our reputation severely hurt throughout the rest of the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham similarly called it ''a mistake'' to give Congressional blessing to the military commissions as envisioned in Mr. Bush's presidential order. ''We have a chance to start over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another central question is whether the Geneva Conventions extend to accused terrorists. Mr. Graham and Mr. Cornyn say no, and Mr. Graham wants Congress to pass legislation overturning the court's finding that Common Article 3 of the conventions applies to detainees. The article's provisions outlawing degrading treatments, he believes, could mean that American soldiers would be subject to prosecution in the war on terror.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cornyn, a former judge, said that the reference to Article 3 meant simply that any court must be established within the military justice system.</p>
        <p>''Congress should not, and the court did not hold that, they are entitled to the whole panoply of rights that the prisoner of war would be entitled to under circumstances where the Geneva Conventions apply,'' Mr. Cornyn said.</p>
        <p>Other Republicans, though, fear that any system that does not pay heed to the court's mentioning of the Geneva Conventions risks being rejected by the court again.</p>
        <p>''We've got to structure this law in such a way that if it ever came back up through the Supreme Court, it will not be struck down,'' Mr. Warner said. ''It's important for the credibility of the United States to put this issue at rest and let the world realize we're affording them the protections as the Supreme Court outlined.''</p>
        <p>Democrats will argue that harsh conditions at Guantánamo have made the prison a rallying cry for new terrorist recruits.</p>
        <p>''The issue we believe is most prescient is not the balance between security and liberty, where on issues like this the parties are relatively close, but on competence,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''They just don't do it right, wherever they go. By their stubbornness and refusal to work with Congress, they've made us worse off in Guantánamo today.''</p>
        <p>Congress has rearranged its schedule to debate the issue this month, and those leading the debate say that they want to vote on new legislation, if any is needed, by September.</p>
