        <p>CHICAGO, July 21  Mayor Richard M. Daley said Friday that he shared responsibility for not preventing the torture of scores of criminal suspects at the hands of police officers when he was Cook County state’s attorney in the 1980’s.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Mayor Richard M. Daley said Friday that he shared responsibility for not preventing the torture of scores of criminal suspects at the hands of police officers when he was Cook County state's attorney in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said he had no knowledge of the torture at the time and had done nothing wrong. He added that the police department had made changes, including the videotaping of interrogations, to ensure more accountability.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud of my public service as state senator, state's attorney and mayor of the city of Chicago,'' Mr. Daley said after an unrelated news conference on Friday. ''I would not allow anything like this.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was responding to criticism two days after special prosecutors released a report concluding a four-year investigation into accusations of torture by former Commander Jon Burge and officers under his command on the South Side in the 1970's and 1980's.</p>
        <p>The report did not accuse Mr. Daley of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The report said a police superintendent sent a letter to Mr. Daley's office when he was state's attorney in 1982 regarding abuse accusations. Mr. Daley said he did not remember the letter, but he added that proper procedures had been followed and that he assumed it had been referred to his first assistant.</p>
        <p>''Though the report does not allege any misconduct or cover-up within the state's attorney's office, I know that there are those who will seek to play politics and draw inferences that aren't there,'' Mr. Daley said. ''My emphasis is and will continue to be on making sure we are doing everything possible to ensure that the horrendous abuses of two and three decades ago never happen again.''</p>
        <p>Flint Taylor, a lawyer representing two people who say they were tortured, and another lawyer served federal subpoenas on the special prosecutors on Thursday seeking several transcripts, including Mr. Daley's deposition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said the report showed that Mr. Daley had failed to act when he was given information about torture accusations.</p>
        <p>''Daley is therefore ultimately responsible for Burge having tortured all of our clients,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''This case has to be investigated and prosecuted under federal statutes.''</p>
