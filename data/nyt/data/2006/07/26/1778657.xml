        <p>From the time his family arrived in New Jersey after fleeing Cuba when he was 12, Andres Alonso, the new head of instruction in the New York City schools, says he felt swept up ''in a stream'' of high expectations set by his parents and his teachers.</p>
        <p>That stream carried him from the Union City public schools to Columbia University, where he graduated magna cum laude, to Harvard Law School and on to a high-paying job at a top Wall Street law firm.</p>
        <p>Two years later, the stream dried up.</p>
        <p>He quit the firm, Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed, and after traveling for 19 months, decided to teach in Newark. There, he took on perhaps the hardest imaginable assignment: emotionally disturbed, middle school children who spoke limited English. He did not have a teaching license and had never taken an education course.</p>
        <p>Not quite 20 years later, Dr. Alonso, 49, is at the center of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious effort to overhaul the nation's largest school system. While others carry out structural changes to the bureaucracy, Dr. Alonso's realm is the mystical art of teaching young minds.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on this, in an interview at the Education Department headquarters in Lower Manhattan, Dr. Alonso quoted the Spanish poet and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. ''At some point, it is inevitable that you find yourself and it is up to you to determine whether that moment, that encounter will be about gladness or about sorrow.''</p>
        <p>''I chose the path of law and at some point I felt, 20 years from now, this is not something I will be happy with,'' said Dr. Alonso, whose title is deputy chancellor for teaching and learning. ''Once I fell into teaching, I fell into that stream again. I never looked back. There was such an element of emotional and intellectual engagement.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, after 11 years of teaching, the stream carried him back to Harvard, to the Graduate School of Education. In June 2003, he was writing his dissertation when Diana Lam, the former deputy chancellor, recruited him to be her chief of staff. He stayed in that role for Ms. Lam's successor, Carmen Fariña, who retired on June 30.</p>
        <p>But while Chancellor Joel I. Klein called him a natural choice to replace Ms. Fariña, some school system veterans said Dr. Alonso was unqualified because he was never a principal or superintendent, yet is now the boss of more than 1,500 principals and superintendents.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alonso shrugs off the doubters. ''No person brings all the experience that's necessary,'' he said. ''That's why you have a team.''</p>
        <p>What he brings is an encyclopedic command of educational theory -- often describing himself as a ''researcher and a practitioner'' -- and a tireless belief that the system can improve. He describes himself ideologically as a "pragmatic progressive" but also said he had "deep conservative tendencies" in his views about the content matter that children should learn.</p>
        <p>He hates it when students are referred to as ''at risk,'' icily noting that they are at risk only when educators fail. He denounces failed teaching techniques the way a preacher condemns sin. His speeches are dense with jargon.</p>
        <p>In a talk to principals last week, Dr. Alonso railed against ''attribution theory,'' the blaming of ills like poverty for the failures of schools systems. He opened with exhortations about ''the construction of knowledge'' and spoke about classrooms as arenas of ''micro-political negotiation.'' He got a laugh once, when he said, ''The children come as is; if the parents had better children to send us, they would.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Alonso believes educators can make the difference. Pushed to explain, he spoke about Joel, a student in his first class at the Samuel L. Berliner School for emotionally disturbed children in Newark. In 1990, Dr. Alonso took legal custody of the boy, who was then 15 and no longer his student. And though there was never a formal adoption, he considers Joel his son.</p>
        <p>''Once I took legal custody of him,'' he said, ''then the question became, 'Are the decisions that I am making for him the same decisions that I am making about the rest of my students?' Because otherwise, there is no integrity in what I do.''</p>
        <p>He removed Joel from special education and pushed him to earn a regular diploma in four years.</p>
        <p>''The challenges of taking him out of special education, creating expectations for him so he could succeed, working with people in the system in order to make sure that he was mainstreamed successfully, informs a lot of what I think,'' he said. ''Expectations for kids make an extraordinary difference.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Alonso bristled when asked whether his son's experience was evidence that educators alone cannot overcome the difficulties children bring from home. Because teachers cannot be foster parents to every child, can schools be blamed for failing to surmount societal ills?</p>
        <p>Dr. Alonso said his point was that ''even with the kids who are the most challenged, there is the possibility of success,'' and that school systems are failing children far less needy than his son.</p>
        <p>''Half the kids don't graduate from high school, '' he said. ''We have them for 13 years -- 13 years!'' he added. ''It has to be an act of acceptance, otherwise it wouldn't be the norm for half the kids to not get to their destination.''</p>
        <p>He wants New York's nearly 1.1 million students to be swept along by a stream of high expectations, with the entire system talking about what students need to learn, and how teachers should teach.</p>
        <p>He plans to continue to push extra support for struggling elementary and middle school students and ''to drive that conversation into the high schools.'' He also plans a new focus on non-English speaking students in high school and on further reforms in special education.</p>
        <p>Diane Brinkley, who taught with Dr. Alonso in Newark, recalled long, philosophical discussions with him about students' needs. ''Andres is one of the most tenacious people I know and he refuses to fail,'' she said. ''He has been in the trenches, in the homes of children who are needy, in the classrooms of children who are needy.''</p>
        <p>Accepting his doctorate last month, Dr. Alonso, who is single and lives in New Jersey, thanked parents, students and educators at the Berliner School. ''My expectations of schools, my expectations of teachers, my expectations of adults, my expectations of students at some level have been shaped by what they taught me,'' he said, ''what I experienced through them and with them and my own experience of putting up rather than shutting up.''</p>
