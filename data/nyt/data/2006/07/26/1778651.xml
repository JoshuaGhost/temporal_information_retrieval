        <p>In a region gnawed by war and steeped in tragedy, this town is purgatory.</p>
        <p>Almost 1,600 people are trapped here at the Tibnine Public Hospital, halfway between the hell of war and the promise of security.</p>
        <p>Four miles south is the border with Israel, where daily bombardments and a pitched battle between Israeli forces and Hezbollah guerrillas have ravaged the border towns. Ten miles east is the relative safety of Tyre, the gateway into northern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The road between Tibnine and Tyre has become a deadly path strewn with the rubble of bombed-out buildings and bombed-out cars struck by Israeli warplanes. That has made the town difficult to reach, and equally difficult to leave.</p>
        <p>The families who have continued to arrive in Tibnine over the past week, drawn by the notion that the hospital can provide some sanctuary, are among Lebanon's poorest. Most lack cars to escape the bombardment or do not have the $250 to hire a driver to get away. Theirs is a world in which hope is just out of reach -- hope that the war will end soon, hope that they will reach Tyre, or simply hope that they will be able to eat at night.</p>
        <p>Instead, many in the hospital that is serving as a makeshift shelter have been left to ponder a world in which their homes and most of their possessions have been destroyed.</p>
        <p>''We don't want any food or help,'' said Olaya Alaeddine, 44, who came here from Bint Jbeil on Monday with her sister Zainab after the windows in their home were blown out and they were nearly killed. ''We just want them to stop the bombing.''</p>
        <p>They walked for hours to get to Tibnine despite Zainab's bad knees, Ms. Alaeddine said.</p>
        <p>The refugees began arriving at the hospital last week, sprawling along the stairs and in a stuffy basement lit by candles, piling one on top of the other, but still hoping for some peace. The hospital, which had been under renovation, had had limited medical equipment and supplies and had been sending patients elsewhere. But people in the 60 towns and villages it served looked to it as their best possible refuge.</p>
        <p>Many walked, braving the bombardment and desperate for food. Some left loved ones behind, and others carried their children and elders on their shoulders. Most, however, felt forgotten in a conflict in which the difference between being rich and poor had often made the difference between escaping the bombing and being left to bear the pounding.</p>
        <p>''We spent 10 days under the bombs and died a hundred deaths,'' said Ali Hourani, a stone mason who walked here from Bint Jbeil with four of his children. ''No one asked about us. No one cared about us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hourani said that he left behind his mother, 75, and his diabetic father, 82, who had run out of insulin, and that he worried whether they would survive until the end of the conflict. Mr. Hourani, who had held on at home for days during the bombing, finally gave up and walked to Tibnine, out of fear for his children. He had little other than the clothes he and his family wore, but was still grieving for those he left behind.</p>
        <p>''There's still a lot of people in the village,'' he said. ''We're desperate to get them. Please help us get them.''</p>
        <p>The Lebanese Red Cross has barely been able to bring supplies to Tibnine. The sick and injured have instead been taken to hospitals in Tyre. On Sunday, Israeli warplanes bombed two ambulances transporting patients from the hospital, underscoring the danger on the roads.</p>
        <p>Most of the refugees are living on a single meal of bread and cheese per day. A farmer with a tractor has towed a water tanker back and forth to a nearby well to supply the hospital, although his tractor was twice struck by Israeli fire.</p>
        <p>''It's a difficult situation, but people will have to tolerate it to survive,'' said Ali Wazni, a Red Cross paramedic who has been shuttling patients from Tibnine to Tyre.</p>
        <p>Even in the relative refuge of the hospital, there is little peace: On Tuesday, many of the refugees were rattled by crashing artillery rounds that continued to land nearby, causing more terror than actual damage.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to stay, but they kept bombing us and we couldn't take it anymore,'' said Kamal Mustafa, a baker who explained why he and his family of four had left Aynata. His 8-month-old baby lay beside him in a dirty car seat.</p>
        <p>The family had heard that the hospital could offer food and water and walked for hours to get there. They proved luckier than Mr. Mustafa's brother and his family. That family set out for the hospital on a motorcycle but were struck by Israeli fire, leaving one child dead, he said.</p>
        <p>For many, the guilt of having left behind relatives was palpable. Hala Abu Olaya, 35, from Bint Jbeil, had moved from house to house for days with her sisters and mother before deciding to come by herself to Tibnine. It was hard for her to hide her distress at having done this.</p>
        <p>''We left our house when it was bombed and went to another house and that was bombed, too,'' Ms. Olaya said. ''Then we ran into another house and a bomb landed on the floor, and we escaped to another and they bombed that house as well. I'm left with only the clothes on my back.''</p>
