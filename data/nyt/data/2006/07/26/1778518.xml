        <p>I LIKE to cook, so I needed to raise children who like to eat. It's not difficult, actually. All it takes is ingenuity, bribes, butter and several thousand pounds of pasta. Indeed, I have spent much of the past five years finding ways to combine nearly everything sold at the Union Square Greenmarket with pasta. Beets and chard. Broccoli. Peas and bacon. Fish. Chicken livers. Butternut squash.</p>
        <p>I consider it my duty to create pleasant associations for my children, so that when they hear the word ''spinach'' or ''peas'' they say, ''Yes, please'' and not ''Yuck.''</p>

        <p>I LIKE to cook, so I needed to raise children who like to eat. It's not difficult, actually. All it takes is ingenuity, bribes, butter and several thousand pounds of pasta. Indeed, I have spent much of the past five years finding ways to combine nearly everything sold at the Union Square Greenmarket with pasta. Beets and chard. Broccoli. Peas and bacon. Fish. Chicken livers. Butternut squash.</p>
        <p>I consider it my duty to create pleasant associations for my children, so that when they hear the word ''spinach'' or ''peas'' they say, ''Yes, please'' and not ''Yuck.''</p>
        <p>Pasta's role as a gustatory Trojan horse is so vital to my parental goals that I feel as if I'm cheating when I make, say, macaroni and cheese. What useful service are the noodles performing?</p>
        <p>But come high summer, when the Greenmarket is overwhelmed by tomatoes and corn, I am happy to pull back from my missionary work, if only to make my favorite summer pasta salad. It has loads of tomatoes and corn -- vegetables that most children will eat without being tricked -- along with a sizable ball of fresh mozzarella, so I don't foresee its winning me any blue ribbons at the great maternal 4-H fair that constitutes my vision of Judgment Day.</p>
        <p>It has other merits, however. For one thing, it uses up all those extra tomatoes you bought the last time you went to the farmers' market because they looked so outrageously beautiful you couldn't help yourself. And it has flavor -- a quality I had always taken for granted until the other night.</p>
        <p>That evening I was out for dinner with a group of friends, all mothers. One turned to me and asked with some urgency if I knew any good recipes for pasta salad -- with flavor. ''Now that it's summer, all the mothers I know have nothing better to do than complain about how bland pasta salads are,'' she said, adding melodramatically, ''This is a real problem up in Pound Ridge.''</p>
        <p>I described my recipe and enumerated the legions of fans of all ages it has won over the years. What I didn't tell her, though, was the sad tale of the day my dear pasta salad met ignominy.</p>
        <p>For it turns out that even a dish as simple and appealing as I am capable of creating will be loathed by someone, probably a child. Sometimes even a child related to me by marriage, whom I am therefore required to love in spite of my injured pride.</p>
        <p>My family went to South Carolina for a week last summer, to spend time in a rented beach house with my brothers-in-law and their families. We were seven adults and nine children jammed together, and on the third night it was my turn to cook.</p>
        <p>I wanted to make something using fresh vegetables, as I had been slightly appalled at the number of cans (corn, tomatoes, green beans) that had been opened over the two previous days. But I wanted to make something yummy and child-friendly, so it had to start with pasta, and include tomatoes and cheese.</p>
        <p>Easy enough. In the morning I cut up some oversoft tomatoes and some plum tomatoes that had unfortunately been put in the refrigerator. (Tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated, or they'll turn mealy.) I sprinkled them with salt and sugar, and set them in a barely warm oven to roast all day. In the afternoon I chopped a pile of gorgeous grape tomatoes, sliced the kernels off a few ears of corn, tore up a bunch of basil and mashed a couple of cloves of garlic to a fragrant paste.</p>
        <p>As the day waned I boiled noodles and cubed some milky mozzarella. Then I mixed it all together -- fresh and roasted tomatoes, the basil, the corn, the garlic, the cheese -- with olive oil and lots of butter.</p>
        <p>''Mom?'' said the coolest of my nephews-in-law. ''I don't like this. Can you make me a quesadilla?''</p>
        <p>''Sure!'' said the mom brightly, nudging me out of the kitchen. ''Anyone else want one?''</p>
        <p>''Me! Me! Me!'' went the chorus of little-boy voices, including those of my sons the traitors. Of course, everyone wanted what the cool guy was having, and in no time at all the bulk of my pasta became leftovers.</p>
        <p>Still, I swear to you, if you serve this to a group devoid of spoilers, it will be loved by everyone. Honest.</p>
        <p>Even if I have to go to your house and see to it myself.</p>
        <p>Summer Pasta  Time: 4 to 6 hours (mostly for roasting tomatoes)</p>
        <p>For the roasted tomatoes:  2 1/2 pounds tomatoes (may be imperfect or overripe)  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  2 teaspoons sugar</p>
        <p>For the assembly:  Salt  1 pound pasta like farfalle, penne or fusilli  4 to 6 cloves garlic, finely minced and mashed  2 tablespoons melted butter  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  2 ears corn, raw if very fresh, or lightly steamed  2 pints cherry or grape tomatoes (preferably low-acid orange or yellow), halved or quartered  12 ounces fresh mozzarella or Valley Shepherd Jersey Fresh Mixte, diced (see note)</p>
        <p>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano  1 cup mixed herbs, torn into small pieces (mostly basil, with a little purple basil, orange mint, summer savory and parsley).</p>
        <p>1.  For the roasted tomatoes: Heat oven to 275 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut tomatoes into slices about  3/4 inch thick, reserving ends for another use. Lay slices on baking sheet, and brush with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and sugar. Bake 15 minutes, and reduce heat to 200 degrees. Continue baking, turning halfway through, until tomatoes are shrunken and chewy but not crisp, 4 to 6 hours. (They may be started in the evening and finished the next morning. After partial baking, turn off oven, leaving door closed. In the morning, if tomatoes are not done, reheat oven and continue roasting.)</p>
        <p>2.  For assembly: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente. Meanwhile, chop roasted tomatoes very finely until they are almost a paste. Place in a large serving bowl, and add garlic, butter and olive oil. When pasta is cooked drain well, and add to the bowl while still hot. Toss well.</p>
        <p>3.  Stand ears of corn on end, and slice kernels from cobs. Add corn, cherry or grape tomatoes, mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano to pasta-tomato mixture. Toss well. Add herbs, and toss again. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Valley Shepherd Jersey Fresh Mixte cheese is sometimes available at the Union Square Greenmarket.</p>
