        <p>Think Manet's ''Déjeuner sur L'Herbe'' meets a garbage bin meets Paul McCarthy, and you've got some idea of the visual psychosis in evidence at ''Knock Knock Picnic,'' at Jack the Pelican Presents in Williamsburg. Everything in this determinedly scandalous exhibition by young artists is for sale, though it's hard to imagine who would want a street canoe made of detritus from under the Queensboro Bridge, assembled by the Parfyme Deluxe artist team, above. Nearby, a video shows the artists foot-pedaling their canoe through Brooklyn. (No license was required to ride it on the roads, the gallery's director said, because with three wheels, it evidently counted as a bicycle.) More video art follows, beginning with a three-channel piece by Ondrej Brody and Kristofer Paetau, in which actors in a sealed room are shown performing raunchy acts at the request of the artists, communicating by cellphone. In the back room is a renegade installation -- a vast accumulation of junk and rubbish, mostly -- by Marc Grubstein, David Henry Brown and Chad Spicer. This sprawling dyspeptic picnic is about the dark side of the American suburban idyll. On occasion, even this space requires tidying: the day I visited, the artists had just finished cleaning up to stave off vermin. (''Knock Knock Picnic,'' Jack the Pelican Presents, 487 Driggs Avenue, near North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, through Aug. 6; 718-782-0183 or jackthepelicanpresents.com.)</p>
