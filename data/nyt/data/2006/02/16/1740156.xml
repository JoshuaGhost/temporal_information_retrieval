        <p>The homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, endured two and a half hours of intense personal criticism Wednesday by Senate Republicans and Democrats investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina, several of whom said he bore responsibility for a multitude of errors that prolonged the suffering of Gulf Coast residents.</p>

        <p>The homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, endured two and a half hours of intense personal criticism Wednesday by Senate Republicans and Democrats investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina, several of whom said he bore responsibility for a multitude of errors that prolonged the suffering of Gulf Coast residents.</p>
        <p>The rebuke was a painful turnabout for Mr. Chertoff, a former federal judge who was unanimously confirmed a year ago to take over the department and until recently had largely escaped blame for the government's flawed response to the storm.</p>
        <p>''The federal department that was supposed to lead, direct and coordinate the federal response to Katrina was time and again, late, uncertain and ineffective,'' Senator Susan M. Collins, Republican of Maine, told Mr. Chertoff. He sat before her, his jaw clenched, and his head at times nodding.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said that Mr. Chertoff's actions soon after the storm hit -- when he flew to Atlanta for a conference, unaware of the extent of the New Orleans flooding -- were disturbing.</p>
        <p>''How could you have left us with so many of those agencies so unprepared that when Katrina struck, they ran around like Keystone Kops,'' Mr. Lieberman asked, ''uncertain about what they were supposed to do, or unable to do it?''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration, facing complaints that it has not done enough to rebuild New Orleans, announced Wednesday that it would ask Congress for an additional $4.2 billion to compensate Louisiana residents whose homes were severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. [Page A30.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff told the senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that Hurricane Katrina had been ''one of the most difficult and traumatic experiences of my life.'' He added, ''I am accountable and accept responsibility.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that he and his department had failed to respond adequately to the disaster, citing management lapses, improper deployment of staff and the unreliable delivery of disaster relief supplies. He said that his department had moved far too slowly to evacuate the refugees who packed the New Orleans Superdome and, later, the city's convention center.</p>
        <p>''The worst element of this catastrophe personally is not criticism I've received,'' he said, ''but the derision of people who did have their suffering unnecessarily prolonged because this department did not perform.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff, who took over the department seven months before Hurricane Katrina struck, focused most of his initial efforts on ''the great calling of our generation,'' which he said was the war against terror. He rarely mentioned natural disasters or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is charged with leading relief efforts.</p>
        <p>He agreed with senators on Wednesday that he had wrongly placed his confidence in Michael D. Brown, the former FEMA director. Mr. Brown all but boasted in testimony Friday that he did not respect Mr. Chertoff's authority and circumvented him, leaving the secretary unaware of what was going on in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>''I can't help but conclude that that was one of your biggest mistakes,'' Ms. Collins said of Mr. Chertoff's trust in Mr. Brown.</p>
        <p>Despite the barrage of complaints, neither Ms. Collins nor Mr. Lieberman, the Senate committee's leaders, called for Mr. Chertoff to resign. Instead, they said that decision was up to President Bush.</p>
        <p>The White House, which has also been criticized as having exercised flawed leadership in the Hurricane Katrina crisis, has made it clear that such a move is not being considered.</p>
        <p>''Secretary Chertoff is doing a great job,'' the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff's testimony, which had none of the combative, defensive tone of Mr. Brown's exchanges, concluded just as a House committee formally issued its 520-page report on Hurricane Katrina titled ''A Failure of Initiative.''</p>
        <p>Representative Thomas M. Davis III, the Virginia Republican who was chairman of the House investigation, said that all levels of government deserved blame.</p>
        <p>''Katrina was a national failure, an abdication of the most solemn obligation to provide for the common welfare,'' Mr. Davis said, as he released the report. ''Our report is a litany of mistakes, misjudgments, lapses and absurdities all cascading together, blinding us to what was coming and hobbling any collective effort to respond.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff told the Senate panel that when he was nominated last year to take over the department, succeeding Tom Ridge, he bluntly warned the committee that the department needed some major work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff said he did not consider himself ''a hurricane operator'' and that he asked Mr. Brown the day before Hurricane Katrina hit if he needed help from other agencies or the Pentagon. Mr. Brown assured him that he was ready, he said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman and others told Mr. Chertoff that simply checking in with Mr. Brown was not enough.</p>
        <p>''It was very clear there was a loaded gun poised and aimed at the city of New Orleans,'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff, the senator said, should have made sure that buses had been lined up in advance to help evacuate the 100,000 New Orleans residents who had no way to get out of the city on their own. Other committee members asked Mr. Chertoff how he could have been unaware that the levees had been breached the day the storm hit even though a FEMA staff member on the ground had reported the failure to Washington. An e-mail message detailing that account had been sent that night to Mr. Chertoff's top deputy.</p>
        <p>''How did these screw-ups happen?'' asked Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chertoff acknowledged that he and other senior department officials had failed to appreciate the significance of the reported breaches until the day after the storm.</p>
        <p>He outlined for the senators his plans to revamp FEMA, including the creation of special reconnaissance teams that will be charged with rapidly assessing conditions on the ground in future disasters.</p>
        <p>Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee told him they appreciated his candor and willingness to accept blame, contrasting it with the testimony on Friday by Mr. Brown.</p>
        <p>''Those who have lost loved ones, homes and jobs may need more accountability,'' said Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii. ''You have a responsibility to convince the American people that you understand what went wrong with D.H.S.'s response and to convince us that you have a clear strategy to ensure these mistakes will not be made again."</p>
