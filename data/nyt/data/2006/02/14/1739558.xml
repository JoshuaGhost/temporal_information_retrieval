        <p>Whether the genre is comedy, tragedy or history, it's no secret to regular theatergoers that all often does not go well for Shakespeare, even on stages in New York City, the country's theater capital. If the actress playing the cross-dressing ingénue is lovely and affecting, her paramour may be played by a cardboard charmer with a popular television show on his résumé. Or maybe the clowns hit their marks, but the love-struck youngsters speak verse as if they're reading the list of additives from the back of a cereal box.</p>
        <p>Which is why the Theater for a New Audience production of ''All's Well That Ends Well,'' which opened on Sunday night at the Duke on 42nd Street, inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production with nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role.</p>

        <p>Whether the genre is comedy, tragedy or history, it's no secret to regular theatergoers that all often does not go well for Shakespeare, even on stages in New York City, the country's theater capital. If the actress playing the cross-dressing ingénue is lovely and affecting, her paramour may be played by a cardboard charmer with a popular television show on his résumé. Or maybe the clowns hit their marks, but the love-struck youngsters speak verse as if they're reading the list of additives from the back of a cereal box.</p>
        <p>Which is why the Theater for a New Audience production of ''All's Well That Ends Well,'' which opened on Sunday night at the Duke on 42nd Street, inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production with nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role.</p>
        <p>Blanketed in images of illness, dishonor and death, ''All's Well'' is not among Shakespeare's most beloved comedies, for justifiable reasons. Its strong-willed heroine, Helena, has an almost pathological attraction to Bertram, a man who disdains her with an equally peculiar vehemence. To their great credit and our reward, Darko Tresnjak, the director of this production, and the actors playing this uncomfortably matched pair, Kate Forbes and Lucas Hall, find a way to make Helena's determined stalking of her uninterested mate seem psychologically credible, and his eventual capture seem fitting and even touching.</p>
        <p>Ms. Forbes's quietly impassioned performance beautifully illuminates how the commingling heartaches of grief and love have sharpened Helena's perceptions and hastened her emotional maturity. Mourning both her father and the old Count Rossillion, Bertram's father and her protector, she becomes a willful proselytizer for forces allied against death, the life-giving process of procreative love and the healing power of medicine.</p>
        <p>Curing the ailing king of France, she wins the higher-born Bertram's hand as a prize. But he offers it only under duress, and with a curled lip. At this point, admiration for Helena's devotion often mingles with discomfort at her nearly masochistic desire to wed a man who cruelly -- and publicly -- rebuffs her confession of love.</p>
        <p>But by suggesting the complicated layers of feeling that underlie Bertram's rejection, Mr. Tresnjak and Mr. Hall smooth away the rough edge of his rejection, also diluting the perversity of Helena's attraction. In the scene in which Bertram takes leave of his new wife -- after vowing never to share the marriage bed with her -- Mr. Hall manages to suggest that real brotherly affection plays its part in his discomfort at their union; his voice contains an unspoken apology, a hint of camaraderie, even perhaps a plea for forgiveness and understanding.</p>
        <p>There is an essential sympathy here, it is hinted, that needs only to be redirected through the process of maturation. When Helena leaves the stage and Bertram vows again to forswear her forever, it is with a distinct note of false bravado, an attempt to feign what he doesn't truly feel. Mr. Hall's boyish good looks and slender frame place a stamp of physical immaturity on the character that likewise explains his unease; he's an adolescent forced before his time into manhood, and is only obeying the impulses of his young blood when he flees the embrace of his wiser new wife.</p>
        <p>Bertram is brought into a humbling new relationship with the concepts of honor and dishonor through the exposure of his perfidious comrade Parolles, who is played with delightful sniveling charm by Adam Stein. Himself skinny as a drumstick, Mr. Stein makes hilarious use of such an implement when Parolles pines for his lost instrument, with ultimately disastrous results for his heroic posturing.</p>
        <p>In fact virtually all the actors here seem to have an intuitive understanding of their characters and their roles in the complex architecture of the play, not to mention an unstrained affinity for Shakespeare's language. Among the supporting performances, it wouldn't be fair to overlook Tom Bloom's crisp, judicious Lafew or the comic pleasures of John Christopher Jones's doughy, deadpan Lavatch.</p>
        <p>Laurie Kennedy's reflective Countess of Rossillion, Bertram's mother and a mother figure to Helena, sets the overridingly somber tone, which is echoed in David P. Gordon's sets and Linda Cho's costumes. (The production is effectively updated to the years before World War I.) When both son and new daughter-in-law are lost to her, we watch the Countess succumb quietly to the infirmities of age and perhaps the shadow of illness.</p>
        <p>As the French king, George Morfogen undergoes the opposite transformation, moving away from the cosseting comfort of ill health to the more demanding role of full participation in life and all its confusions. The jig he dances upon recuperation is maybe the only overdone touch in Mr. Tresnjak's production, which otherwise finds engaging ways to lighten the mood, through the use of French and Italian folk songs, for instance, or a backdrop of a Florentine cityscape that signals as much a change in tenor as a change in locale.</p>
        <p>The graceful mixture of light and dark in the production underscores the play's mixed message, that trust must be placed in the sometimes harsh but natural processes of life to right seeming wrongs and expose the true natures of our hearts. All the major characters have to confront death or its specter to acquire perspective on experience. Even the hopelessly corrupt Parolles, snared in a trap that brings him to the verge of execution (or so he thinks), can see that though he is utterly abject, all has in a sense ended well. Out of a job, mocked and reviled, he is nevertheless very much alive, and speaks some of the first honest words he's ever ventured: ''Yet I am thankful: If my heart were great, 'twould burst at this.''</p>
