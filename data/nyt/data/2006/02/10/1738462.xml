        <p>ALICE SCHILLE is no Mary Cassatt. Yet Schille, an Impressionist painter, studied in New York, traveled the world and was regularly included in some of early 20th-century America's most important exhibits. Her watercolors and oils are still the subject of traveling shows, and a leading American art historian, William H. Gerdts, wrote a book about her in 2001.</p>
        <p>But unlike Cassatt, Schille is hardly a household name. Schille (1869- 1955)returned to her hometown, Columbus, Ohio, to paint and teach. ''When you use Ohio as a regional base, it's harder to build a career that gets you into the history books,'' said Nannette Maciejunes, executive director of the Columbus Museum of Art.</p>

        <p>ALICE SCHILLE is no Mary Cassatt. Yet Schille, an Impressionist painter, studied in New York, traveled the world and was regularly included in some of early 20th-century America's most important exhibits. Her watercolors and oils are still the subject of traveling shows, and a leading American art historian, William H. Gerdts, wrote a book about her in 2001.</p>
        <p>But unlike Cassatt, Schille is hardly a household name. Schille (1869- 1955)returned to her hometown, Columbus, Ohio, to paint and teach. ''When you use Ohio as a regional base, it's harder to build a career that gets you into the history books,'' said Nannette Maciejunes, executive director of the Columbus Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>So when the museum opened a 74-work American Impressionists exhibition last Friday, it also set up a separate 51-work show devoted to Schille. Both run until June 4. ''We wanted to show the full spectrum of what American Impressionists were doing,'' Ms. Maciejunes said. And ''we wanted to feature someone with roots in our community, to show Columbus in a national context.''</p>
        <p>Other museums across the country are exploiting the popular combination of the favorite-son factor and the broad appeal of Impressionism.</p>
        <p>At the Cape Cod Museum of Art, a museum founded by artists concerned that too much area artwork was ending up elsewhere, the daily mission is to focus on locals. And because of a bequeathed gift, it will exhibit the work of John Joseph Enneking, who studied with European masters in Paris and Munich in the 1870's and became one of the first American Impressionists, settling in Hyde Park, Mass. Works by the artist's son, Joseph Eliot Enneking, will also be featured.</p>
        <p>The elder Enneking's work was so respected that another artist of his time, Childe Hassam -- whose work was the subject of a show at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2004 -- invited him to join the Group of 10 American Painters. (He declined.) The show runs from March 4 through May 21.</p>
        <p>The James A. Michener Museum (named after a favorite son of a different medium) in Doylestown, Pa., regularly shows work of the Pennsylvania Impressionists (a group whose members had exhibitions all over the world), often gifts of the collectors Marguerite and Gerry Lenfest. From March 18 to July 2, the museum is showing all 62 paintings given by the Lenfests.</p>
        <p>Another Impressionist, Colin Campbell Cooper (to whom Dr. Gerdts devoted substantial attention in his book ''Impressionist New York'') settled in Caliornia during the 1920's but also maintained a presence in New York. A Cooper exhibition reflective of local pride in both locations will run from Nov. 11, 2006, to Jan. 28, 2007, at the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington, N.Y., and then move to the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>In Montana, the Hockaday Museum in Kalispell persuaded six living artists who paint in the Impressionist style, all of them from Montana, to show at an exhibition that runs through March 17. The museum's director and curator, Linda Engh-Grady, said that the work of one of these artists, Bye Bitney, is in such demand that he usually has exhibitions in larger markets like California and Arizona.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to bring the work home to Kalispell,'' she said. ''People get excited when they see what's going in their backyards.''</p>
        <p>But these exhibitions aren't always just an exercise in area cheerleading. Artists who stayed at home may be worth a second look. And Ms. Engh-Grady is also concerned about the current state of art education.</p>
        <p>''There are too many constraints to paint within existing formats,'' she said. The museum wants to expose young artists to ''the daring of the Impressionists to mix new colors,'' she said, and ''paint outside the lines'' -- the name of her museum's show.</p>
        <p>Today, of course, Impressionism is almost universally loved. ''It's an accessible art form that people can respond to readily,'' said Elizabeth Hunter, executive director of the Cape Cod Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maciejunes of the Columbus Museum put it more simply: ''It just makes you smile.''</p>
