        <p>When the speed skater Chris Witty carries the American flag into the Olympic Stadium at the opening ceremony Friday night, she will also bear a lighter emotional burden than in her previous four Olympics.</p>
        <p>Witty, who was elected flag bearer on Wednesday night by a vote of the captains of the United States teams, revealed those burdens 18 months ago, when she told of being sexually abused as a child by a neighbor in her hometown of West Allis, Wis. Now 30, Witty said therapy and the public revelation freed her depression and anxiety.</p>
        <p>''I am a totally different person now,'' she said, smiling comfortably despite recounting her life from age 4 to 11. ''What a wonderful opportunity not just to be the flag bearer, but to have a platform and hopefully do some good in this world.''</p>
        <p>Witty made her first Olympic team in 1994. She won two medals at the 1998 Games, and she won a gold medal and set a world record in the 1,000 meters in 2002 in Salt Lake City on the oval where she now trains. She also made the 2000 Summer Olympics as a track cyclist, finishing fifth in the 500-meter time trial.</p>
        <p>Through it all, she was shy and uncomfortable around people.</p>
        <p>Since revealing her abuse in 2004, Witty has helped establish anti-abuse programs in several Salt Lake City schools. They are a variation on the ''Good Touch/Bad Touch'' presentation she saw when she was 11, which gave her the courage to tell her abuser to stop.</p>
        <p>But it was only after the 2002 Games, when she finally sought therapy, that she dealt with it. She said that when she learned how abuse thrived on secrecy, she decided that coming forward could only help.</p>
        <p>''For like 20 years, I believed it was all my fault,'' she said. ''If a kid is out there and it's happened to them, if they just knew the adult knew better. I'd say, 'You were taken advantage of and it's O.K. to talk about it.' ''</p>
        <p>By making this year's team, Witty becomes the 25th American to compete in five or more Games and she is only the ninth to compete in both a Summer and Winter Games. She said she came here hoping to be chosen as flagbearer, but not expecting it. She said even before this honor, she was already enjoying her experience here more than any of the others.</p>
        <p>''If anything, I'm just more relaxed,'' she said. ''I don't have this sort of cloud over me. I can just be more comfortable with people around me. It has just changed me as a person. I've enjoyed my sport more because of it.''</p>
        <p>SKIERS FAIL TESTING -- Eight cross-country skiers competing in the Olympics, including two Americans, were found to have excessive hemogloblin levels, the International Ski Federation announced Thursday. The skiers will not be allowed to compete for five days, but it was not immediately clear when the ban began and whether any of the skiers would be kept from competing in their events.</p>
        <p>The American athletes are Kikkan Randall and Leif Zimmermann. The others are Sean Crooks of Canada, Sergey Dalidovich of Belarus, Jean Marc Gaillard of France, Aleksandr Latzukin of Belarus, Natalia Matveeva of Russia and Evi Sachenbacher of Germany.</p>
        <p>Hemoglobin is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen from the lungs to all cells. Illicit strategies, such as the use of synthetic hemoglobin and blood transfusions, have been used by some athletes to increase the oxygen in the muscles.</p>

        <p>IT'S STRIKE 3, AGAIN -- Baseball and softball, voted out of the 2012 London Olympics last July, are definitely out. The International Olympic Committee rejected pleas for reinstatement Thursday. ''I am shocked and deeply disappointed,'' said Dot Richardson, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in softball. ''It's a shame that politics between nations will affect in a negative way the future dreams of young girls and young women.''</p>
