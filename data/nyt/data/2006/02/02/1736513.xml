        <p>Boy George, a pair of arching, feminine eyebrows the only hint of the gender-bending makeup that once made him a pop sensation, ambled down the aisle in a Manhattan criminal courtroom yesterday, looking pale and tense.</p>
        <p>''He's a very sweet man,'' his lawyer, Louis Freeman, told spectators. ''When he's in court, he really stiffens up.''</p>
        <p>Boy George, who gained fame as the lead singer of the 80's group Culture Club, called 911 in the wee hours of Oct. 7 to report that his apartment in Little Italy had been burglarized. In a sort of bonus, the police say they found cocaine on a computer table.</p>
        <p>The singer, known in court papers as George O'Dowd, flew to New York from his home in London to face a felony charge of drug possession.</p>
        <p>But for those trying to follow the progress of his case in open court, it could best be described as a mystery.</p>
        <p>Within 60 seconds, after conferring privately with the prosecution and the defense, the judge postponed the case, for the third time.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Dowd, 44, dressed all in black, with a Star of David tattoo showing through his buzz-cut, never said a word. As he left the courtroom, Kristine from New York, Joann from Rhode Island and Debbie from Connecticut, ardent fans who have been attending his concerts since they were teenagers, wrapped him in bear hugs.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. O'Dowd was convicted of possessing heroin in England, and he entered a rehabilitation program. After the October arrest, his lawyer said that only a small amount of cocaine had been found and that Mr. O'Dowd, whose loft was cluttered with materials from his fashion line, did not know its origin.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors contend otherwise. As usual in such cases, there will be negotiations between the prosecution and the defense, seeking an outcome, short of trial, acceptable to all.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. O'Dowd's lawyer said, the case has to ''get ripe.''</p>
        <p>''Like a piece of fruit?'' asked a baffled British reporter.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, like a piece of fruit,'' Mr. Freeman said.</p>
        <p>Until then, his lawyer said, Boy George will be going back home.</p>
