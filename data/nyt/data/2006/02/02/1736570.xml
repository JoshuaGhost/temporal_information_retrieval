        <p>Tensions in the battle for the post of presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature reached a new height on Wednesday as lawyers went to prosecutors to report concern about political interference in the court overseeing the dispute.</p>
        <p>Though one lawyer was quick to say he believed that nothing improper had happened, the episode underscored how much is at stake and how edgy both sides have become.</p>
        <p>The monthlong struggle over the post took another perplexing turn, with a judge's decision to nullify the recent selection of the Republican minority leader as the new presiding officer, on the ground that he failed to win a majority of the votes.</p>
        <p>What happens next is unclear, both politically and legally.</p>
        <p>Without a presiding officer, the Legislature cannot function. The presiding officer appoints committee members and leaders, schedules meetings, controls legislation and can issue subpoenas. Since Jan. 1, the legislators have not conducted regular business.</p>
        <p>In his decision on Wednesday, Justice Joseph P. Spinola of State Supreme Court in Nassau ruled that choosing the presiding officer requires a majority of at least 10 of the 19 legislators.</p>
        <p>In the Legislature's chaotic first session last week, the minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt, led with nine votes, all Republicans. The Democratic majority split, eight for Kevan M. Abrahams, and two for Roger H. Corbin. The Republicans declared Mr. Schmitt duly elected, but the main Democratic faction challenged him in court.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Justice Spinola ordered the Legislature to reconvene to pick a presiding officer, and the holdover presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, has scheduled a meeting for Monday. What that meeting would accomplish is unclear, since no one claims 10 votes. It is even uncertain that the meeting will take place. Lawyers for the Republicans and dissident Democrats are appealing the court ruling and will seek to block the meeting. They claim that a presiding officer need only win more votes than his competitors; a majority, they say, is not necessary.</p>
        <p>With the appeal pending, chances of compromise have waned. One dissident Democrat, Lisanne G. Altmann, said there was no change in her position or Mr. Corbin's.</p>
        <p>The question of interference arose when the Nassau County Democratic Party chairman, Jay S. Jacobs, recently met with the Nassau County Conservative Party chairman, Roger C. Bogsted. Mr. Jacobs said he worried that something might be amiss because Mr. Bogsted was so confident that the Republicans would win the case. Justice Spinola is a Conservative.</p>
        <p>Four lawyers on different sides of the case went to the judge's office to ask if he had contact with Mr. Bogsted, and an aide denied it, they said. But since the issue had been raised, they said they were ethically obliged to report it, so they went to the district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>A Democratic lawyer who was there, Steven Schlesinger, said, ''I 100 percent believe nothing untoward happened.'' Mr. Bogsted also denied any contact.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, one passage of the judge's ruling was uncontested: ''The court is well aware that its decision will have significant consequences in the balance of political power with the Nassau County Legislature.''</p>
