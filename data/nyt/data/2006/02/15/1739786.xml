        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) LOST -- Is it possible that one of the plane-crash survivors on the island is part of the feared group know as the Others? Rousseau (a k a the crazy Frenchwoman) leads Sayid to a captive who could be one of them. Sawyer (Josh Holloway, left), who proved himself to be an unrepentant con man last week, is worried about a strange creature that won't leave him alone. And it turns out that Hurley, who seemed so harmless, has betrayed everyone's trust.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) 2006 OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES -- Tonight's events, tape-delayed from Turin, Italy, are Alpine skiing (women's downhill), freestyle skiing (men's moguls), short-track speedskating (women's 500-meter final, men's 5,000-meter relay and 1,000-meter individual), luge (men's doubles) and the ski jump and cross-country race known as Nordic combined (team).</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Speed) DRIVER OF THE YEAR -- The finalists are Greg Anderson, Sébastien Bourdais, Steve Kinser, Tony Schumacher, Tony Stewart and Dan Wheldon. In addition to track performance, the criteria are humanitarianism, sportsmanship and just plain popularity with racing fans.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Now things are getting interesting. The names of the 24 semifinalists are revealed.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (Oxygen) HIGH FIDELITY (2000). John Cusack stars in this comedy (based on Nick Hornby's book) about a single, vinyloriented record-store owner recounting the Top Five romantic breakups of his life. One ex-girlfriend is played by Lili Taylor (above, with Mr. Cusack) and another by Catherine Zeta-Jones, so he has eclectic tastes in women.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (MTV) FAT CAMP -- In this two-hour special, five teenagers try their best to get healthy and thin.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) BONES -- When Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and her F.B.I. agent partner, Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), work together, things aren't always simple. Tonight's episode involves a wealthy politician, a gang member from El Salvador, a drive-by shooting, a dead body in a car trunk and two empty graves in a garden.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (TV Land) THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT -- Wayne Brady and his guests, who include the comic D. L. Hughley and the actress Nia Long (right), assess the most influential black music stars. Mr. Brady's list includes Billie Holiday, Jimi Hendrix, Prince, Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke. They also talk about divas, interracial dating and the meaning of bling. Part 3 of 3.</p>
