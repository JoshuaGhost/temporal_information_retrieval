      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Though ABC and Fox have been directly challenging NBC's Olympics, CBS has mostly ducked out of the way this week. And since it is CBS that largely owns Thursday night, its ''CSI'' and ''Without a Trace'' repeats allowed NBC to regain first place after two defeats in a row by Fox's ''American Idol'' sledgehammer. In Nielsen's estimates for 8 to 11 p.m., NBC attracted 19.12 million viewers, versus CBS's 16.71 million. CBS's only original offering, ''Survivor,'' drew fewer viewers than the first hour of ABC's 90-minute ''Dancing With the Stars'' for the second week in a row (17.06 million compared with 18.26 million), but ''Survivor'' still had a comfortable victory among adults 18 to 49.  Vice President Dick Cheney's first public appearance since he shot his hunting partner last weekend produced above-average ratings for ''Special Report With Brit Hume.'' The Fox News program, in which Mr. Hume pressed Mr. Cheney about the accident and its aftermath, brought in 2.1 million viewers, 513,000 of them in the 25-to-54 demographic sought by advertisers in the television news audience. The interview brought the show its highest ratings of the year so far.</p>
