        <p>Letter from William L Minnix Jr (American Assn of Homes and Services for the Aging) comments on problem of providing rental housing for low-income elderly (Feb 15 article); notes Pres Bush has proposed cutting by nearly $200 million the federal program that provides for both construction and rent subsidies for low-income elderly</p>

        <p>''Hot Niche in the Rental Market: Housing for the Elderly'' (Business Day, Feb. 15) focused on the investment potential of this housing but missed the main point: our population is aging, and older adults need a place to live.</p>
        <p>As noted, there are many options for people with money, but what about people who cannot afford a $399,000 entry fee or $6,000 monthly maintenance costs?</p>
        <p>President Bush has proposed cutting by nearly $200 million the federal program that provides for both construction and rent subsidies for low-income elderly. The remaining funds would provide an average of 54 new units per state at a time when there are nine people on the waiting list for every available unit.</p>
        <p>Many affordable housing communities provide services like meals and transportation, helping residents avoid premature institutional care. That's a good investment.</p>
        <p>William L. Minnix Jr.  Washington, Feb. 16, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is chief executive of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging.</p>
