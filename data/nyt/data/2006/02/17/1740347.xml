        <p>George Steinbrenner finished his salad and stuffed shells, rose from the lunch table where he had been sitting with Brian Cashman, and headed for his ever-ready golf cart.</p>
        <p>It is a rite of spring training at Legends Field: reporters staking out Steinbrenner to hear him speak on his own, instead of through his publicist. He tried to make a quick getaway, his tires lurching past the foot of a radio reporter. But when someone asked about the World Baseball Classic, Steinbrenner hit the brakes and took the bait.</p>
        <p>''Well, we don't like it too well, because if a player gets hurt, he's risking a lot,'' Steinbrenner said Thursday. ''But it was Selig's idea and he wants to do it, so I suppose we're going to do it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees voted against the World Baseball Classic in August 2004, even though it was a concept supported by Commissioner Bud Selig and the players union. In the final vote, the Yankees abstained while three teams -- the Royals, the Tigers and the White Sox -- voted against it.</p>
        <p>Four of Steinbrenner's everyday players are expected to take part: Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez for the United States, and Bernie Williams for Puerto Rico. Miguel Cairo may play for Venezuela, and Ramiro Mendoza may pitch for Panama.</p>
        <p>Many players have backed out of participating, including second baseman Robinson Cano (Dominican Republic) and pitcher Chien-Ming Wang (Taiwan). Steinbrenner said his players were welcome to withdraw, but he would not tell them to.</p>
        <p>''There will be some more backouts,'' Steinbrenner said. ''Whether it's our players or somebody else's, I don't know. But I'm used to spring training being to concentrate on the World Series, and that's what we'd like to see our players do.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees petitioned to have catcher Jorge Posada dropped from Puerto Rico's roster, and other prominent Yankees will not take part. Randy Johnson was excused because of insurance costs, and reliever Mariano Rivera said he could not pitch for Panama because he did not throw all winter.</p>
        <p>''Definitely, I wish the timing would have been different, a time when we didn't have to worry about spring training and we have been throwing already so you can participate for your country,'' Rivera said. ''But it isn't. It is what it is. It's too bad.''</p>
        <p>At a charity event in November, Jeter said his decision to play was up to Steinbrenner. But Jeter said he never spoke with Steinbrenner about it, and he is the top shortstop on the United States roster.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to it,'' Jeter said Thursday. ''It's going to be interesting. I've never had a chance to play for my country before.''</p>
        <p>Jeter, Damon and Rodriguez (who was criticized by White Sox Manager Ozzie Guillen in this week's Sports Illustrated for considering a spot on the Dominican team) will leave the Yankees on March 2 to train with the United States squad. Al Leiter, the veteran left-hander in camp on a nonroster contract, said he hoped to join them, though he was left off the United States' roster.</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo, who will manage the Class A Tampa Yankees this season, is the manager for Venezuela. Sojo's team will be loaded with strong starters, including Johan Santana, Freddy Garcia and Carlos Zambrano. Is his team the favorite?</p>
        <p>''I would say so,'' Sojo said. ''If I don't have the best pitching staff, it's very close.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' staff, it seems, may stay together in Tampa all spring. That will make Steinbrenner happy, even with much of his lineup elsewhere. Steinbrenner's focus never wavers from the World Series, and he was asked if he was impatient at not winning it since 2000.</p>
        <p>''Yes, very impatient,'' Steinbrenner said, revving up the engine on his golf cart. ''Get out of my way.''</p>
        <p>ERICKSON IS GIVEN A LOOK -- Acting on a tip from first baseman Jason Giambi, the Yankees gave a tryout Thursday to Scott Erickson, the veteran 38-year-old right-hander. Erickson threw for Manager Joe Torre, the pitching coach Ron Guidry and the bullpen coach Joe Kerrigan, and the Yankees signed him as a nonroster player.</p>
        <p>Giambi saw Erickson throw this winter and recommended that the Yankees scout him. Erickson made the Dodgers' rotation out of spring training last season, but he went 1-4, was moved to the bullpen and finished with a 6.02 earned run average in 19 games.</p>
        <p>MUSSINA OPEN TO EXTENSION -- Mike Mussina showed up at Legends Field on Thursday, about to start the final year of his contract. The Yankees hold a $17 million option for 2007, with a $1.5 million buyout, and Mussina said he would be open to discussing an extension.</p>
        <p>''We'd all like security; if Cash wants to come talk about it, we'll go have lunch,'' Mussina said referring to the Yankees' general manager, Brian Cashman. ''But we'll worry about that when the time comes.''</p>
        <p>For the Yankees, that time is not now. Mussina missed six weeks in 2004 and three weeks last September because of elbow problems, and the Yankees will wait before deciding his future with the team. ''I think that's something we'll deal with at the end of the season,'' Cashman said.</p>
        <p>Mussina said that he threw off a mound four times before coming to Florida and that his elbow did not bother him.</p>
        <p>''I feel fine, I feel good, I feel like I should,'' Mussina said, before pausing and smiling. ''Look, I made that rhyme, like Dr. Seuss.''</p>
