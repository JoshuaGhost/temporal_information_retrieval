        <p>Shiite lawmakers decided by a one-vote margin on Sunday to retain Ibrahim al-Jaafari as prime minister in Iraq's next government, after a bitter internal struggle that exposed the growing power of anti-American fundamentalists within the new Parliament.</p>
        <p>As the largest single bloc in the Parliament, the Shiites have the right to choose a prime minister under Iraq's Constitution, and they will now begin negotiating with the leaders of other political groups to fill out Iraq's first full-term, four-year government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaafari, a moderate Islamist, has been widely criticized as a weak leader over the past year and was considered a long shot to continue in his post. But he defeated his main rival by 64 to 63 in a vote of members of the Shiite bloc on Sunday morning after gaining support from followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the renegade Shiite cleric who is outspoken in his hostility to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sadr's followers now control the largest bloc of seats -- 32 of 130 -- within the Shiite alliance. They decided to vote for Mr. Jaafari after he promised to help carry out their political program, said Bahaa al-Aaraji, a member of Parliament and a spokesman for Mr. Sadr's group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aaraji would not say exactly what the prime minister had agreed to. Mr. Jaafari may also have benefited from Mr. Sadr's longstanding grudge against the religious Shiite party of Mr. Jaafari's main rival.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jaafari's surprise victory illustrated the growing political power of Mr. Sadr, who led two bloody uprisings against the American occupation and the interim government in 2004 and has made it clear that he favors a prompt American withdrawal from Iraq.</p>
        <p>In recent visits to Iran and Syria, Mr. Sadr has expressed solidarity with the leaders of those countries and angry opposition to American policy toward them. Mr. Sadr also commands the Mahdi Army, a broad-based militia that has been largely quiet since 2004 but is still armed and is said to be behind some recent deadly attacks on British troops in Basra.</p>
        <p>Until the weekend, Shiite leaders had said they expected the prime minister's job to go to Adel Abdul Mahdi, an economist and a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or Sciri. Mr. Mahdi has a reputation for decisiveness and consensus-building, and he is more popular with Kurdish and Sunni Arab leaders than Mr. Jaafari is. But Mr. Jaafari refused to withdraw, and after efforts to achieve consensus broke down in rancor, the alliance's leaders agreed to decide the issue with a vote.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Shiite leaders made a show of unity at a news conference, with Mr. Mahdi congratulating and praising his rival on a podium surrounded by banners bearing Shiite religious slogans. ''It's not important who won; the important thing is that the United Iraqi Alliance stays unified,'' Mr. Jaafari said.</p>
        <p>A number of Iraqi leaders outside the Shiite alliance expressed surprise and concern about the selection of Mr. Jaafari and about what appeared to be the influence exercised by Mr. Sadr's followers.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised and rather disappointed,'' said Adnan Pachachi, a former foreign minister and member of the secular alliance led by the former interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, that has 25 seats in the 275-member Parliament. ''If he follows what the Sadrists want, we will not be able to have a government of national unity.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rejected the suggestion that Mr. Sadr had played a important role in the choice of prime minister. Asked about Mr. Sadr's influence, she said on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that ''Iraq is a complex place with a lot of voices'' and ''there are many forces behind the apparent election of -- or selection of Jaafari.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaafari's government has been especially unpopular with Sunni Arabs, who have accused the Interior Ministry of backing death squads that have rounded up and murdered hundreds of Sunnis in Baghdad and elsewhere in recent months. Many Sunnis have also accused Shiite militias, including Mr. Sadr's Mahdi Army, of playing roles in the killings.</p>
        <p>''Jaafari failed to provide security and protect Iraqis,'' said Mahmoud al-Mashadani, a Sunni Arab and a leader of the Iraqi Accordance Front, which has the third-largest bloc in Parliament, with 44 seats.</p>
        <p>Talks on forming a cabinet are still in the earliest stages, and Parliament has yet to meet. But signs of tension were already apparent on Sunday, as the president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who has often sparred with Mr. Jaafari, angrily criticized Shiite leaders for trying to exclude Mr. Allawi's group, the Iraqi National List, from the new government.</p>
        <p>''We will never under any circumstances allow the Iraqi National List to be excluded from the next government,'' Mr. Talabani said, speaking at a news conference. ''Those who reject the Iraqi National List should understand that they are rejecting the Kurdish alliance as well. I say it loud and clear.''</p>
        <p>Some Shiite leaders had said last month that they intended to form a government in which they would share power with the main Kurdish and Sunni groups, relegating Mr. Allawi's secularists and some smaller parties to the opposition. (Under the Constitution, any group that controls two-thirds of the seats in Parliament can form a government.) But the mostly secular Kurds, who have the second-largest bloc with 53 seats, appear to be vetoing that option.</p>
        <p>Sunni Arab leaders also insist on a broader coalition. In the past week, the Iraqi Accordance front announced that it was teaming up with Mr. Allawi's group and a smaller Sunni Arab party to form a single negotiating bloc, the Joint Council for Patriotic Work, with 80 seats.</p>
        <p>The task of accommodating all these groups within a single government will now fall in large measure to Mr. Jaafari. A white-haired doctor with a quiet, apologetic manner, Mr. Jaafari, 59, fled Iraq in 1980 and spent years living in Iran, where he established close ties with Iranian leaders, like many other members of his Dawa Party.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Jaafari became prime minister last year, suicide bombings and assassinations have surged and oil production and exports have plummeted. Some Iraqi leaders, including fellow Shiites, have said he was not decisive enough for the job. Others said he allowed Shiite militias to infiltrate Iraq's police forces and the military, leading to a rash of sectarian killings in Sunni neighborhoods that have harmed efforts to draw Iraq's Sunni insurgents into the political process.</p>
        <p>The expanded power of Mr. Sadr could further complicate the process. Last fall, in an effort to keep Mr. Sadr from forming his own party, leaders of the United Iraqi Alliance offered his followers 30 seats -- the same number as Sciri, the largest Shiite party. A small Sadrist party also won two seats in the December elections, and in recent days they have joined the alliance, making Mr. Sadr's faction the largest.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how much control Mr. Sadr exercises over his followers in Parliament. During the past year he has often suggested that he is a clerical figure above the fray of politics. He has been similarly vague about his ties to the Mahdi Army, which unofficially polices parts of Baghdad but is regularly accused of carrying out assassinations and bombings.</p>
        <p>Nassir Saadi, one of Mr. Sadr's followers in Parliament, said Sunday that he and other members of the group would be free to vote their consciences. But he said all of the members met regularly with a three-man committee that was in constant touch with Mr. Sadr. Mr. Aaraji saidhe expected the Sadr bloc to be given control of four or five ministries when a government was formed.</p>
        <p>On some issues, Mr. Sadr's views are at odds with those of fellow Shiites and could provide a bridge to other elements within Parliament. Most Shiite representatives, for example, favor the creation of semiautonomous regions within Iraq, a proposal that has caused tremendous anger among Sunni Arab leaders. Mr. Sadr has said he believes that it would be premature to create such regions now. His strong opposition to the American presence is also echoed by many Sunni figures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaafari's election came as insurgent violence left at least a dozen people dead across Iraq on Sunday. In southern Baghdad, a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt blew himself up near a mosque, killing three police commandos and a woman and wounding four people, Interior Ministry officials said.</p>
        <p>Gunmen opened fire on a truck near a food market in the Shiite Shola district, killing two people inside, the officials said. Elsewhere in the city, a roadside bomb exploded near a passing Iraqi police convoy, killing an adult civilian and a child and wounding three others.</p>
        <p>At least three more bombs exploded in other areas of Baghdad, including two near a downtown bakery that wounded a dozen people.</p>
        <p>Interior Ministry officials said two unidentified bodies, blindfolded and handcuffed, were found in western Baghdad with bullets in their heads.</p>
