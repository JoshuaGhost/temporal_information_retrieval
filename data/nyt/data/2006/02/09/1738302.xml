        <p>When Steven P. Jobs introduced the Mac Mini, he expected customers to bring their own keyboard and mouse. But many keyboards -- salvaged from old family PC's -- clash with the look of Apple's austere products. The Logitech S530 addresses that issue handily.</p>
        <p>This three-quarter-inch-thick keyboard and mouse combo comes in blinding white and is cordless. Both the mouse and the keyboard connect to the computer via an unobtrusive U.S.B. receiver.</p>

        <p>When Steven P. Jobs introduced the Mac Mini, he expected customers to bring their own keyboard and mouse. But many keyboards -- salvaged from old family PC's -- clash with the look of Apple's austere products. The Logitech S530 addresses that issue handily.</p>
        <p>This three-quarter-inch-thick keyboard and mouse combo comes in blinding white and is cordless. Both the mouse and the keyboard connect to the computer via an unobtrusive U.S.B. receiver.</p>
        <p>Logitech has included some nice features just for Mac users, including separate iTunes, iPhoto and Spotlight search buttons. There is also a dedicated Mail button, as well as dedicated scroll buttons for viewing Web pages.</p>
        <p>The S530 is available online and at most stores for about $99.</p>
        <p>The mouse has five programmable buttons and a scroll wheel that tilts from side to side for easier Web browsing and document editing.</p>
        <p>The mouse requires two AA batteries and the keyboard requires two AAA batteries. Battery life is about six months. When they begin to fail, the keyboard and mouse both flash, and they will last 10 days before dying completely.</p>
