        <p>When was New York City's musical golden age? Candidates from the last three and a half decades are performing in town this week. The NEW YORK DOLLS, who trashed up early-1970's glam-rock so much it anticipated punk, have been reconstituted by the surviving members, DAVID JOHANSEN and SYLVAIN SYLVAIN. They headline an all-night D.J. dance party. Sunday, 10 p.m., with the Dolls at 11:30 p.m.; Avalon, 47 West 20th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 807-7780; $30.</p>
        <p>The brash, angular punk-funk of the early 1980's has been widely recycled lately, but one of the New York originals plays a rare reunion this week. The BUSH TETRAS released the indelible ''Too Many Creeps'' in 1980, setting dissonant guitar riffs and a blunt beat against caustic vocals. Friday, 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; $10 in advance, $12 day of show.</p>
        <p>The YEAH YEAH YEAHS represent this decade's New York rock renaissance, mixing arty intelligence and punky back-to-basics -- guitar, drums, voice -- sparked by the giddy, anarchic presence of the singer KAREN O. Three years after their great debut album, they're releasing a more cryptic, more somber follow-up, ''Show Your Bones,'' in March. These club dates will introduce a second guitarist. Thursday, 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; sold out. Friday and Saturday, 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out.</p>
        <p>Another New York golden age inspires the SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA, a big band whose members were essential sidemen during salsa's heyday in the 1970's. It revives songs that merged hard-charging dance rhythms with positive thinking, playing them with love and gusto. Tuesday through Sunday, 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $30 at tables, plus a minimum.</p>
