        <p>Like many Washington couples, Jeffrey and Alexandra Shockey need the advice of a lawyer on how to conduct their pillow talk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shockey is a top aide to Representative Jerry Lewis, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and Mrs. Shockey is a lobbyist for a firm that seeks to influence the congressman.</p>
        <p>So when Senator Arlen Specter this week defended the marriage of one of his aides to a lobbyist with interests in her work, the Shockeys and others around town could empathize. Marriages to lobbyists are increasingly common among Capitol staff members and even members of Congress -- a situation that, even in Congress's current zeal for overhauling lobbying, almost no one seriously expects to be restricted any time soon.</p>
        <p>Among the many members of Congress married to lobbyists are Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the Republican whip; Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan; Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota; and Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Among Congressional staff, marriages to lobbyists are even more prevalent. This week, Mr. Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, defended the work of Vicki Siegel Herson, an aide who until recently handled military appropriations. She is married to Michael Herson, a top executive of the lobbying firm American Defense International; six clients of Mr. Herson's firm benefited from provisions Mr. Specter added to spending legislation. Mr. Specter said Mr. Herson's firm did not lobby his office on the clients' behalf, but the senator referred the matter to the ethics committee nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Another Specter aide, Bettilou Taylor, clerk for the labor, health and human services appropriations subcommittee, is married to Domenic Ruscio, a partner in the major lobbying firm Cavarocchi, Ruscio, Dennis Associates. Their relationship was publicized last year when Ms. Taylor helped organize hearings concerning some of the firm's clients in public television. A spokesman for Mr. Specter said the Senate ethics committee looked into the matter and found no impropriety.</p>
        <p>No one suggests Mr. Specter's staff is the exception. ''You can't single him out,'' said Keith Ashdown, spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense. ''It is standard procedure.''</p>
        <p>Congressional ethics rules do not bar spouses of lawmakers from lobbying. The Senate Ethics Manual says ''the decision on whether a spouse may lobby the Senate is generally a decision for the senator and his or her spouse, given due regard for the potential reflection on the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Spouses of staff members also face only limited restrictions. ''The spouse of a chief of staff should not lobby the supervising senator or the senator's other employees who are supervised by the chief of staff, although the employee's staff would be free to lobby nonsupervising senators and other Senate employees,'' the manual says. ''The spouse's associates would not be prohibited from lobbying any members or staff so long as the Senate employee's name is not used.''</p>
        <p>The ethics rules do forbid members or staff members from knowingly using their positions to benefit themselves or their families. But it is hard to know how much one spouse may tell the other about his or her work.</p>
        <p>Marriages joining lobbyists with lawmakers or their staff members were unheard of a few decades ago, said Donald A. Ritchie, a Senate historian. But since the 1960's, he said, such unions have become more common as the numbers of staff members and lobbyists have exploded.</p>
        <p>Just as important, growing numbers of women have come to work at all levels of Congress, increasing the likelihood of romance under the Capitol dome. Each year, thousands of young, single men and women come to Congress from around the country as entry-level staff members, working long hours and socializing at night. Many marry. And a good number of those follow the well-trodden path to higher-paid jobs lobbying their former colleagues and, potentially, their spouses.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the scandal involving the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Senate Republican leaders circulated a memorandum in December listing 10 potential rule changes to address ethics reform, including ''terminating spouse/relative lobbying.'' But so far, none of the leading proposals in either chamber include new restrictions on lobbying by spouses. For one thing, several staff members said, restricting lobbying by spouses could lead to an exodus of staffers.</p>
        <p>''We live in a different world than we did 30 or 40 years ago, and people should recognize it,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of the nonpartisan ethics group Democracy 21, which usually pushes for more stringent lobbying restrictions. He is also a former lobbyist and married to the journalist Linda Wertheimer of National Public Radio.</p>
        <p>''You need some way of recognizing that couples can both be engaged in professional activities that in, general terms, may relate to each other,'' he said. ''And in the first instance those folks have a responsibility to take the extra step to avoid any conflict of interest or the appearance of conflict.''</p>
        <p>Paul A. Miller, president of the American League of Lobbyists, argued that it was unfair to single out lobbyists. ''We don't do stories about the number of doctors who are married to pharmaceutical sales representatives,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>But the Shockeys are becoming a favorite example for advocates of lobbying reform. Both started their careers a decade ago as young single members of Mr. Lewis's staff.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Mr. Shockey went to work with a friend of Mr. Lewis's, former Congressman Bill Lowery, at the lobbying firm Copeland, Lowery &amp; Jacquez. While Mr. Shockey was there, the firm's clients, including several private firms and the city of San Diego, won several million dollars in federal funds through Mr. Lewis's actions. Meanwhile, the firm and some of its clients contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr. Lewis's campaign funds.</p>
        <p>Then, last January, when Mr. Lewis became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Shockey left the firm to rejoin the congressman's staff as a senior aide, coming full circle.</p>
        <p>And to help take his place, the firm retained his wife, who had set up her own lobbying firm, as a subcontractor. She began handling some of her husband's former clients.</p>
        <p>The relationships were the subject of an article in The San Diego Union-Tribune in December. The Shockeys and their lawyer, William Oldaker, did not return calls for comment. Mr. Oldaker has said the couple sought his advice and complied with Congressional ethics rules.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Lewis said, ''Jeff Shockey is a fabulously talented individual, and I am proud that he agreed to join me a year ago in my effort to reform the appropriations process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis continued: ''Jeff and his wife, Alex, have gone out of their way to make sure they are strictly adhering to both the spirit and the letter of the law.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 23, 2006, Thursday  An article on Sunday about members of Congress and their aides who are married to lobbyists referred imprecisely to Debbie Dingell (identified in the article only as the wife of Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and shown in a picture with him at their Dearborn home). While Ms. Dingell advises General Motors on lobbying strategy in her role as executive director of community and government relations, she is not currently a registered lobbyist.</p>
