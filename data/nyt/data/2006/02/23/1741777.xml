        <p>In his first news conference since being declared president of Haiti last week, René Préval kept up the mystery swirling around the possible return from exile of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, saying only that the Constitution permits him to come home if Mr. Aristide so chooses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide, a former ally of Mr. Préval's, was forced out of office two years ago by a violent uprising and pressure from the United States. The former president, accused by his opponents of corruption and violent repression, fled Haiti and has since lived in South Africa.</p>
        <p>However, he has begun sending messages that he would like to return home. In a televised appearance in South Africa on Wednesday, Mr. Aristide said he looked forward to returning to Haiti ''as soon as possible,'' and said he would consult with Mr. Préval about an appropriate time.</p>
        <p>When asked last Thursday how he felt about Mr. Aristide's desire to return home, Mr. Préval said: ''My position is simple. Article 41 of the Constitution stipulates that no Haitian needs a visa to leave his country, or to return to it.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Préval seemed to throw the decision back to Mr. Aristide, saying, ''Questions about whether he will be involved in politics, you have to ask him, not me.''</p>
        <p>It is the question that has dominated public attention in Haiti since last week, when Mr. Préval was declared the winner of the Feb. 7 presidential election. Political opponents of Mr. Aristide's, and several foreign diplomats, have made clear to Mr. Préval that they do not want Mr. Aristide to return. And even though Mr. Aristide is still loved by this country's poor, political leaders critical of the way he was removed from power acknowledge that his return could start a new round of unrest in Haiti, the hemisphere's most troubled country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Préval, a protégé of Mr. Aristide, who was president from 1996 to 2001, has so far refused to publicly address those concerns. The president-elect has tried, since he began running for a new term in office, to distance himself from Mr. Aristide by forming his own political party and surrounding himself with advisers known as opponents to Mr. Aristide.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Préval was elected with the overwhelming support of the poor people who had lifted Mr. Aristide to power.</p>
