        <p>A person attuned to science fiction might think of New York State government as a confluence of the real world and the otherworldly.

But there is also a phantom government -- a universe where public-private authorities do a lot of public business in private.</p>
        <p>In the past three years, there has been some progress in dragging these authorities out of the shadows. Comptroller Alan Hevesi began systematically auditing the 700 or so authorities, corporations or other entities that borrow billions of dollars each year with little oversight or public notice. Assemblyman Richard Brodsky uncovered some of the more outlandish secrets of this other governmental universe, like the development rights along the Erie Canal that were sold for a pittance.</p>

        <p>A person attuned to science fiction might think of New York State government as a confluence of the real world and the otherworldly. There is the obvious side of government -- with the Legislature debating more in the open these days and Gov. George Pataki dragging legislative leaders into public discussions of the budget. But there is also a phantom government -- a universe where public-private authorities do a lot of public business in private.</p>
        <p>In the past three years, there has been some progress in dragging these authorities out of the shadows. Comptroller Alan Hevesi began systematically auditing the 700 or so authorities, corporations or other entities that borrow billions of dollars each year with little oversight or public notice. Assemblyman Richard Brodsky uncovered some of the more outlandish secrets of this other governmental universe, like the development rights along the Erie Canal that were sold for a pittance.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers even passed an authorities reform act last year that took a solid step in the right direction. And finally, Governor Pataki set up a Commission on Public Authority Reform, with Ira Millstein as its chairman.</p>
        <p>Now comes the hard part of making it all work. After Mr. Hevesi's office audited many authorities, it found one gaping hole: the lack of oversight for the billions of dollars in contracts handled by these quasi-private entities. Mr. Hevesi reported last September that nobody knows how many contracts these authorities enter into annually or the exact dollar value and terms of the contracts. And he said that while most authorities had procurement guidelines, they often ignored them ''when it was inconvenient or when a competitive process might have produced other than predetermined, desired results.'' Mr. Hevesi proposed that his office be allowed to oversee authority contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millstein's commission is expected to issue a report and propose legislation as soon as April. The reform act passed last year by the Legislature established a new Public Authority Budget Office; the commission's first order of business should be to ensure that office's independence. It won't help if the office is run by the governor, since the governor already has so much control over this ghost government. The commission is also expected to propose that authority directors take an oath -- not to the politicians who appoint them, but to perform their fiduciary duties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, whose appointment of Mr. Millstein and his commission has offered some hope of progress in this area, should now make certain that the commission's recommendations are carried out faithfully, both in state agencies and in the Legislature. Mr. Hevesi, who has done such important work, also needs to continue pushing for more oversight authority by the comptroller.</p>
        <p>The door to this closed world has been cracked open; this would be a good year to swing it wide.</p>
