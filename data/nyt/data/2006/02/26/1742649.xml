        <p>WHEN Thomas Delaney woke up shortly before 3 a.m. on Sept. 8, he mistook the staccato bleat of the smoke alarm for his own alarm clock, and the white smoke filling his apartment for steam. Then his brain jostled the pieces together, and panic crashed in like thunder.</p>
        <p>''My left brain was saying, 'What about your passport?' '' he said. ''And my right brain answered, 'If you don't get out now, you won't need a passport.' ''</p>

        <p>WHEN Thomas Delaney woke up shortly before 3 a.m. on Sept. 8, he mistook the staccato bleat of the smoke alarm for his own alarm clock, and the white smoke filling his apartment for steam. Then his brain jostled the pieces together, and panic crashed in like thunder.</p>
        <p>''My left brain was saying, 'What about your passport?' '' he said. ''And my right brain answered, 'If you don't get out now, you won't need a passport.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delaney, a sunken-cheeked native of Ireland whose two-bedroom apartment was on the third floor of his six-story walkup, climbed through a rear window onto the rusty fire escape of his building, at Amsterdam Avenue and 107th Street. He then helped a neighbor, a man named Prince, pull out his terrified mother, a 400-pound woman in a nightgown, while other residents crowded onto the fire escape and cautiously made their way down to the street. Trembling, they clustered in the backyard and watched as huge plumes of smoke rose from the building.</p>
        <p>The four-alarm fire, at 964 Amsterdam Avenue, left two people dead and nearly 70 homeless. Like many of them, Mr. Delaney, a 60-year-old former actor on disability, was put in a city shelter. The building, by then filled with debris, was padlocked.</p>
        <p>Still shell-shocked a few weeks after the fire and increasingly frustrated by his inability to return to the apartment where he had lived for 22 years, Mr. Delaney started sitting in front of the building, equipped with his guitar, a blues harmonica on a neck brace, a microphone and a small portable amplifier that runs on AA batteries.</p>
        <p>There, he strummed his favorite Muddy Waters and Hank Williams tunes, but he also began playing songs he had written himself, songs about the fire and its terrible fallout. The other afternoon, he sang a song with the woeful refrain ''I Wanna Go Home'':</p>
        <p>This is my building</p>
        <p>This was my home</p>
        <p>It went up in flames</p>
        <p>Now I'm all alone.</p>
        <p>''It gives me structure and it gives me a voice,'' Mr. Delaney said of his songs, adding that he often changed the lyrics to offer updates on actions against the landlord in Housing Court, the status of repairs to the building, even the whereabouts of a caramel-colored cat named Hunter who was stranded inside the building for three months until being rescued by Mr. Delaney.</p>
        <p>After Housing Court appearances by the tenants and their lawyers, a judge ordered the landlord, Joel Weiner, to complete repairs by June 30 so tenants can move back in.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Delaney maintains his musical vigil outside the building five or six afternoons a week. ''We're all at one level or another suffering some form of trauma,'' he said. ''One of my ways of dealing with it is being out here every day as a gatekeeper. Just seeing who's coming and going. This is my home.''</p>
