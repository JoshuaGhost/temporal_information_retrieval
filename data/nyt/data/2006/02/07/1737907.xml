        <p>Michael J Connelly letter on Maureen Dowd's Feb 4 column says Pres Bush's promotion of cellulosic ethanol as alternative energy source is purely rhetorical; says there are numerous drawbacks to biofuels, including distribution problems</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As Maureen Dowd notes, the Saudi ambassador need not worry that President Bush went green in his State of the Union address because he criticized America's addiction to oil and promoted cellulosic ethanol as an alternative energy source.</p>
        <p>Sure, biofuels are supported by diverse interest groups, including environmentalists, automakers and America-first defense hawks. And yes, the president said that they could be available in just a few years.</p>

        <p>As Maureen Dowd notes, the Saudi ambassador need not worry that President Bush went green in his State of the Union address because he criticized America's addiction to oil and promoted cellulosic ethanol as an alternative energy source.</p>
        <p>Sure, biofuels are supported by diverse interest groups, including environmentalists, automakers and America-first defense hawks. And yes, the president said that they could be available in just a few years.</p>
        <p>But their numerous drawbacks, including distribution problems, cost and a lack of vehicles that can use them, are not going to be overcome by the drop-in-the-bucket $150 million Mr. Bush is proposing to spend.</p>
        <p>No, Mr. Bush hasn't gone green; he's gone rhetorical. The only alternative energy to emerge from his speech was hot air.</p>
