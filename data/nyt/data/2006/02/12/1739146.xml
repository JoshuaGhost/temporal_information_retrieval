        <p>Your article about Governors Island (''Sleeping Beauty,'' Feb. 5) brought back many memories, as did the 1955 photo of the island, looking like a giant potholder. That was the year that I began a 21-month Army stint there, at what was then First Army Headquarters.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about Governors Island (''Sleeping Beauty,'' Feb. 5) brought back many memories, as did the 1955 photo of the island, looking like a giant potholder. That was the year that I began a 21-month Army stint there, at what was then First Army Headquarters.</p>
        <p>Governors Island was considered the most enviable place for an Army draftee from New York to spend his days in uniform. Married enlisted men were even allowed to live off-base, taking the ferry back and forth on weekdays. I wound up there because I had worked as a legal stenographer while attending City College at night, and the island was the location of court-martial trials for offenses ranging from desertion to collaborating with the enemy (North Korea at that time).</p>
        <p>Enviable assignment or not, there was a no-nonsense military aspect to the place. There were spit-and-polish formations and parades and details like K.P. (kitchen police) and prison guard. Castle Williams, the stockade for prisoners awaiting trial, remains a baleful presence to this day, and I often wonder where the lives of those whose testimony I took at trials have taken them.</p>
