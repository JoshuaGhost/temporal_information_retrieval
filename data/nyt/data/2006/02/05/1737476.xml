        <p>For nearly half of Saturday's game between the Nets and the Miami Heat, Shaquille O'Neal had a front-row seat. And even when he was on the floor, the Nets stood tall.</p>
        <p>With O'Neal hampered by foul trouble, the Nets took an early lead, held off a late challenge and defeated the Heat, 105-92, for their 10th consecutive victory at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''Shaq in foul trouble makes life easy for everybody,'' said Vince Carter, who finished with the second triple-double of his career: 28 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. Carter's other triple-double came in April 2000 when he was with the Toronto Raptors.</p>
        <p>It was a notable victory for the Nets (24-21), who might have felt a little unsure of themselves after beating the Detroit Pistons, who have the N.B.A.'s best record, on Tuesday, but losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers the following night.</p>
        <p>The Heat (29-19) had won its previous four games and has the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, making the victory that much sweeter for the Nets.</p>
        <p>''This was a character check for us to come back and protect home and beat a team playing extremely well,'' said Jason Kidd, who had 16 points and 10 assists. ''We didn't panic, we had good looks and we got stops when we had to.''</p>
        <p>The Nets never trailed, but they let the Heat go on a handful of runs. Each time, the Nets responded with a burst of their own. An 8-point lead early in the fourth quarter was trimmed to a point with less than seven minutes remaining. The Nets then went on a 12-4 spurt, capped by a 21-foot jumper from Carter, to seal the victory.</p>
        <p>It was also a balanced effort, as Richard Jefferson scored 26 points and Clifford Robinson added 23.</p>
        <p>Much of the credit belonged to Jason Collins, whose aching body after the game did not show up on the stat sheet. Collins often had the unenviable task of guarding O'Neal during the Heat center's 26 minutes of action. Collins stuck to O'Neal like a fly to a picnic table, limiting him to 11 points on 4-for-12 shooting and 7 rebounds in 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>O'Neal picked up his third foul with 8 minutes 1 second left in the second quarter and the Nets leading by 8 points. He sat for the rest of the half and was replaced by Alonzo Mourning, who was greeted with boos from many of the 19,268 fans. An unhappy Mourning was traded to the Raptors by the Nets in December 2004.</p>
        <p>The Nets' lead swelled to 16 points when Robinson made a 3-pointer less than three minutes later.</p>
        <p>''When you're guarding him, it's like pushing a wall for 48 minutes or however long you're in there,'' Collins said of O'Neal. ''He really tries to lean on you. I just tried to do a good job pushing him and make him shoot over me. Whenever he's going to turn to the basket, just stick my chin there or my chest, and hold my position.''</p>
        <p>The Nets also received a fine performance from Robinson. When Nenad Krstic went home before the game with flulike symptoms, Robinson started in his place. He was 4 for 6 on 3-point attempts.</p>
        <p>The Nets took a 33-24 lead after the first quarter, with Carter scoring a team-high 15 points. The Heat's defense tightened during the final three quarters, limiting Carter's looks to the basket. So, instead, he sought the open man and wound up with the triple-double.</p>
        <p>The Heat closed the second quarter with a 15-3 run and trailed, 55-51, at halftime. The score was tied, 58-58, when the Nets went on a 13-2 run midway through the third quarter. A 3-pointer by Robinson gave the Nets a 15-point lead. The Heat then called timeout, and Robinson headed to the bench while staring at his hands, as if they were too hot to handle.</p>
        <p>''I've been a starter in this league a long time,'' Robinson said. ''I've come off the bench some years, too. I've been effective at both. So for me to step in in the absence of somebody and start and be effective, that shouldn't be a surprise to no one.''</p>
        <p>The Heat was without a starting forward, too: Udonis Haslem missed the game for personal reasons.</p>
        <p>With the Heat in such a large hole, Coach Pat Riley sat O'Neal for nearly half of the third quarter. O'Neal, who picked up two fouls in the final minutes, did not speak to reporters after the game.</p>
        <p>''When Shaq's not on the floor, you know it's going to be a Dwyane Wade pick-and-roll game,'' Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said. ''And that's hard enough.''</p>
        <p>Wade finished with a game-high 31 points and made numerous shots that were likely to end up on highlight reels. But it was not enough to overcome O'Neal's absence, or Gary Payton's for that matter. Payton was 0 for 6 from the field and did not score in 29 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Every time we got it close, they just seemed to make the play,'' Wade said. ''That is what good teams are supposed to do at home.''</p>
