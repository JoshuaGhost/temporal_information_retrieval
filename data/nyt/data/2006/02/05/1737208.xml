        <p>Wendy Wasserstein's death wasn't a surprise. Not to her friends, anyway. She'd been sick for some time, and they'd all been following it closely. She was the ''center of a huge part of the New York theater community,'' said the writer Nora Ephron.</p>
        <p>So when the last moment came, it fell to them to spread the sad news. ''I was about to go to the hospital and James Lapine, who was there, called me,'' said André Bishop, a close friend and frequent collaborator of the playwright, referring to the director, who was another longtime friend of Ms. Wassertein's. ''The word was out very quickly. In that strange and mysterious way, the drums started beating.''</p>

        <p>Wendy Wasserstein's death wasn't a surprise. Not to her friends, anyway. She'd been sick for some time, and they'd all been following it closely. She was the ''center of a huge part of the New York theater community,'' said the writer Nora Ephron.</p>
        <p>So when the last moment came, it fell to them to spread the sad news. ''I was about to go to the hospital and James Lapine, who was there, called me,'' said André Bishop, a close friend and frequent collaborator of the playwright, referring to the director, who was another longtime friend of Ms. Wassertein's. ''The word was out very quickly. In that strange and mysterious way, the drums started beating.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bishop called Jane Rosenthal, the co-founder of the TriBeCa Film Festival, who described herself as one of Ms. Wasserstein's ''everyday'' friends. ''I feel like I'm one of the newer friends at 25 years,'' she said. Recalling a line from one of Ms. Wasserstein's books -- ''You can judge the quality of a woman by how long she keeps her friends'' -- she thought of those who had known her longer, including the playwrights Christopher Durang and Peter Parnell, the director Daniel Sullivan and the composer William Finn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finn called Sarah Saltzberg, Ms. Wasserstein's former nanny, and one of the creators of ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,'' which Ms. Wasserstein helped get produced. Ms. Saltzberg called her castmates.</p>
        <p>''The whole time that I worked for her she never introduced me as her nanny,'' Ms. Saltzberg said. ''She always introduced me as an actress.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parnell added: ''She could really help with your social life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wasserstein introduced Mr. Parnell to his partner, Justin Richardson, a psychiatrist. ''This morning, I was looking through all the books, all the volumes she had given me over the years,'' Mr. Parnell said. ''In her volume of 'The Heidi Chronicles and Other Plays,' she wrote, 'Next year, plays and husbands for everyone.' That was very much the kind of looking-out-for-her-friends sentiment she had.''</p>
        <p>When a press agent phoned Swoosie Kurtz on the West Coast with the news, she immediately dug through a keepsake box for a Valentine's Day card from Ms. Wasserstein. Well, from Ginger, Ms. Wasserstein's cat. ''I read it to myself, and that did me in,'' Ms. Kurtz said.</p>
        <p>The playwright Tina Howe, in an e-mail message, said: ''I heard about Wendy's condition months ago from friends. Those closest to her were reluctant to talk about what was going on. All they'd say was that her situation was grave. So in a sense the theater community has been mourning her for weeks.''</p>
        <p>''The idea that she's no longer with us is insupportable,'' she continued, ''so we continue to talk about her in the present tense.''</p>
