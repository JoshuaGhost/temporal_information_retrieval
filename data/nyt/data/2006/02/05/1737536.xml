        <p>I followed Kurt Eichenwald's reporting on the Justin Berry story both in print and online. Your column and Mr. Eichenwald's articles, as well as television interviews with Mr. Eichenwald, made me distinctly uncomfortable for three reasons: (1) the unilateral praise for Mr. Eichenwald's ''good'' deeds and the underlying assumption that Mr. Eichenwald's behavior was heroic; (2) the lack of critical analysis of Mr. Berry's responsibility for his own behavior; and (3) the lack of critical analysis of the adult Mr. Berry's decision (with Mr. Eichenwald's assistance) to turn in hundreds of men to the F.B.I.</p>

        <p>The Times reported on and discussed in depth Mr. Eichenwald's ''special'' involvement with Mr. Berry as a journalistic subject, but it failed to continue that analysis when it came to Mr. Eichenwald's key involvement in an F.B.I. investigation.</p>
