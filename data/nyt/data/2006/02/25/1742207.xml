        <p>Report by Congressional Research Service says Arab countries have used oil revenues to make investments in United States' real estate, oil refining, computer and financial services industries; Saudi Arabia's Prince Walib bin Talal is most prominent investor from region who became one of Citigroup's largest shareholders with 3.9 percent stake; investors from Dubai have made largest investments in recent months (M)</p>

        <p>Despite soaring oil revenues in the Middle East and the uproar over the attempt by a Dubai company to control seaport terminals at several American ports, Arab countries have made little effort to acquire hard assets in the United States, confining their investment mostly to holdings in real estate, oil refining and financial services.</p>
        <p>Middle Eastern countries account for less than 1 percent of $1.5 trillion of foreign direct investment in United States businesses and real estate, according to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service. That lags far behind the largest foreign investors: Britain, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and France.</p>

        <p>Despite soaring oil revenues in the Middle East and the uproar over the attempt by a Dubai company to control seaport terminals at several American ports, Arab countries have made little effort to acquire hard assets in the United States, confining their investment mostly to holdings in real estate, oil refining and financial services.</p>
        <p>Middle Eastern countries account for less than 1 percent of $1.5 trillion of foreign direct investment in United States businesses and real estate, according to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service. That lags far behind the largest foreign investors: Britain, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and France.</p>
        <p>In fact, before Dubai Ports World took over the Pacific &amp; Orient Steam Navigation Company of Britain, Middle Eastern investors largely avoided direct control by obtaining partial ownership through shares in publicly owned companies.</p>
        <p>The most prominent investor from the region is a member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Walid bin Talal , who gained recognition for acquiring a minority holding in the 1990's in Citigroup. Eventually, he became one of its largest shareholders with a 3.9 percent stake.</p>
        <p>The prince, through his Kingdom Holdings investment concern based in Riyadh, has since acquired large stakes in companies including Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer and eBay.</p>
        <p>Investcorp of Bahrain has also gained notice for its investments in the United States and Europe, which have included stakes in upscale retail companies like Saks, Tiffany and Gucci, as well as holdings in CSK, an auto parts company, and Circle K, the convenience store chain.</p>
        <p>Investcorp, whose founders include the former Saudi oil minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, has acted largely like American private-equity firms that invest in ailing companies with the goal of later selling them or taking them public.</p>
        <p>An exception to these financial investments is the energy industry. Saudi Aramco, the government-controlled oil producer of Saudi Arabia, owns interests in three large oil refineries in the eastern and southeastern United States in a venture with Royal Dutch/Shell. Sensitivity over foreign ownership of refining assets has heightened recently with the sparring between the government of Venezuela, which controls Citgo, and the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Aside from rules governing airlines and television broadcasting, the United States places few limits on foreign ownership in other industries. The Defense Production Act, a cold war-era law enacted in 1950 and amended in 1988, allows the president to prohibit a merger or takeover if there is evidence the foreign buyer's actions might threaten security.</p>
        <p>Protectionist sentiment appears to be increasing amid greater scrutiny of the ambitions of Chinese companies in the United States. Officials did not favor the acquisition of Global Crossing by Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong. And Cnooc, a Chinese oil company, was thwarted in its effort to acquire Unocal.</p>
        <p>Still, it is investors from Dubai who have made the biggest investment splash in recent months. Dubai, a glittering sheikdom, flush with petrodollars from neighboring oil exporters, benefited from its transformation into a freewheeling regional financial center. Until now, Dubai's overseas forays have focused largely on high-profile real estate, hotel and auto industry investments.</p>
        <p>For instance, Jumeirah, the luxury hotel group based in Dubai, last month completed its acquisition of the Essex House, the 515-room hotel on Central Park South in Manhattan, while in 2005, Dubai International Capital bought a 2 percent stake in DaimlerChrysler valued at about $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Mubadala Development of Abu Dhabi, which like Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates, has carried out similar investments in Europe, acquiring a 5 percent stake in Ferrari of Italy and a 25 percent stake in LeasePlan, a car rental company based in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Given the surge in oil revenue throughout the Persian Gulf, it is perhaps surprising that overseas investment from the region has been relatively timid. Oil-exporting nations in the Middle East and North Africa are expected to earn about $530 billion from sales of crude oil this year, compared with $300 billion in 2003, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>Still, unlike Asian countries with large surpluses that have plowed that money into purchases of United States Treasury bonds and other financial assets, Middle Eastern oil exporters do not appear to be significant buyers of dollar-denominated bonds as they were during the petrodollar boom of the 1970's, according to Howard Handy, director for the Middle East and Africa at the Institute of International Finance.</p>
        <p>That helps explain why the Dubai Ports deal remains an anomaly. Middle Eastern investors have instead injected much of their riches from the latest oil boom into domestic real estate and stock markets. This month, for instance, the main index for Saudi Arabia's stock market reached a record, extending a surge that has doubled the value of companies on the exchange in the last year, to more than $700 billion.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 1, 2006, Wednesday  An article in Business Day on Saturday about Middle East investments in the United States misstated the name of the British company acquired by Dubai Ports World. It is the Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, not Pacific &amp; Orient.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 2, 2006, Thursday  Two articles on Saturday about the management deal for six American ports and its political fallout referred incorrectly to the role to be played by Dubai Ports World. It would run some of the terminal operations; it would not own the ports or take over all operations.</p>
