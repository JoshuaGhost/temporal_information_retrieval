        <p>Brokeback Mountain  Written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana</p>
        <p>When Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) shows up to visit Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) in the bare-bones apartment he shares with his wife and daughters, Alma Del Mar (Michelle Williams) accidentally discovers that the friendship between them is a lot closer than is considered decent in small-town Wyoming in 1967. After being out all night with Jack, Ennis returns, and Alma is there, quietly waiting.</p>
        <p>Interior: Riverton, Wyo.: Del Mar apartment.</p>
        <p>Alma sits at the kitchen table, disheveled, nervous, hasn't slept all night, a cup of coffee in front of her.</p>
        <p>Ennis comes through the door.</p>
        <p>Alma stands confused yet relieved Ennis came back home, struggles with complex feelings. Keeps big emotion inside. Tries to catch his eye.</p>
        <p>Ennis tries to ignore her.</p>
        <p>Alma looks out the window sees Jack outside his pickup, he leans against the driver door.</p>
        <p>ENNIS -- Me and Jack's heading up to the mountains for a day or two. Do a little fishin'.</p>
        <p>ALMA -- (cautious) You know, your friend could come inside, have a cup of coffee we ain't poison or nothin'.</p>
        <p>ENNIS -- (as if this is explanation enough) He's from Texas.</p>
        <p>ALMA -- Texans don't drink coffee?</p>
        <p>Ennis opens the hall closet. Takes out a duffel bag. Starts to pack.</p>
        <p>Alma's eyes widen.</p>
        <p>ALMA -- You sure that foreman won't fire you for taking off?</p>
        <p>Ennis takes his rod, reel and creel case out of the closet.</p>
        <p>ENNIS -- That foreman owes me. I worked through a blizzard last Christmas, remember? Besides, I'll only be a couple of days.</p>
        <p>Alma Jr. hears her father's voice, stumbles out of the bedroom, rubs sleep out of her eyes.</p>
        <p>ALMA JR. -- Bring me a fish, Daddy, a big fish.</p>
        <p>ENNIS -- (to Alma Jr.) Come here.</p>
        <p>Gives her a big kiss. Turns to Alma.</p>
        <p>Awkward.</p>
        <p>Gives her a quick one-arm hug, kisses her on the cheek.</p>
        <p>ENNIS -- See you Sunday, latest.</p>
        <p>Leaves.</p>
        <p>Alma goes to the window.</p>
        <p>Looks out sees Ennis throw his stuff in the back of Jack's truck. Gets in the passenger side, Jack gets in the driver's side.</p>
        <p>Pale, filled with disquiet, anguish, watches them go.</p>
        <p>Cries.</p>
