        <p>A new coalition of 100 environmental, civic and business groups led by the Nature Conservancy announced plans on Wednesday for a final push to preserve 25,000 acres of open space and 10,000 acres of farmland in Suffolk and Nassau Counties over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The campaign, under the name Long Island's Last Stand, received support from the two county executives, Steve Levy of Suffolk and Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau; they attended its unveiling at the Huntington Hilton. Mr. Levy has made land acquisition a priority for his administration.</p>

        <p>A new coalition of 100 environmental, civic and business groups led by the Nature Conservancy announced plans on Wednesday for a final push to preserve 25,000 acres of open space and 10,000 acres of farmland in Suffolk and Nassau Counties over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The campaign, under the name Long Island's Last Stand, received support from the two county executives, Steve Levy of Suffolk and Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau; they attended its unveiling at the Huntington Hilton. Mr. Levy has made land acquisition a priority for his administration.</p>
        <p>About 2,500 of the targeted acres are in Nassau. The remainder and virtually all the farmland are in Suffolk, where agriculture remains an economic anchor in its five East End towns.</p>
        <p>Kevin McDonald, the director of public lands for the Nature Conservancy on Long Island, said the aim was to preserve the most significant surviving open space on Long Island and to restore, protect and better manage public parklands, harbors and bays.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said financing for purchases of land or development rights or for other conservation measures could come from the New York State Environmental Protection Fund and from restructuring a sales-tax program in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki proposed on Monday that the state budget allocation for the environmental protection fund be increased by 20 percent next year, to $180 million.</p>
