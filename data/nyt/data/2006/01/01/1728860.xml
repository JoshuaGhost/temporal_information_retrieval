        <p>Brrrr</p>
        <p>Q. Walking to work on frigid mornings during the transit strike brought this question to mind: Just how cold can it get in New York, anyway?</p>
        <p>A. Pretty nippy. On Friday, Feb. 9, 1934, at 7:25 a.m., the temperature dropped to minus 14.3 degrees Fahrenheit, the coldest day on record. Todd Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, says that the cause was probably a mass of Arctic air, carried south by the jet stream. The temperature never rose above 7 that day.</p>

        <p>Q. Walking to work on frigid mornings during the transit strike brought this question to mind: Just how cold can it get in New York, anyway?</p>
        <p>A. Pretty nippy. On Friday, Feb. 9, 1934, at 7:25 a.m., the temperature dropped to minus 14.3 degrees Fahrenheit, the coldest day on record. Todd Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, says that the cause was probably a mass of Arctic air, carried south by the jet stream. The temperature never rose above 7 that day.</p>
        <p>Six people died from the cold, including one man in the Jackson Heights IRT station. Dozens fainted from carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to thaw car radiators in closed garages. Hundreds of schoolchildren were treated for frostbitten hands, noses and ears. More than 40 police officers were treated for frostbite, and firefighters had to deal with 652 frozen hydrants. Some fires were fought with chemicals, as no running water was available.</p>
        <p>The 69th Regiment Armory, at Lexington Avenue and 26th Street, sheltered 10,000 homeless men, and another armory took in 2,000 homeless women. The Bronx River was frozen solid. The East River, though open to traffic, was choked with floating ice. Only with the greatest difficulty was a channel kept open in the Hudson.</p>
        <p>Once-Sparkling Streets</p>
        <p>Q. Some time ago, the city was using recycled glass in asphalt to create new streets. So for a time, our streets glistened with glass. Is it still in use?</p>
        <p>A. The city found a better way. Instead of using recycled glass, which it called glasphalt, it is now using recycled asphalt.</p>
        <p>''We did use recycled glass in asphalt produced at our asphalt plant back in the early 1990's,'' Craig Chin, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, wrote in an e-mail message. The use of glasphalt, which was 40 percent glass, began in the 1980's and ended in 1996. ''We stopped this practice when we began using a more suitable recycled material, old asphalt pavement,'' Mr. Chin continued. The material is known as recycled asphalt pavement, or RAP.</p>
        <p>''RAP contains all of the elements of new asphalt -- stone, sand or fine aggregate and, most importantly, asphalt cement -- making it the best recycled material to use in asphalt production,'' he wrote. ''The last material, asphalt cement, is the sticky, black petroleum derivative that makes asphalt hold together and essentially work. It is also the most important material to recycle due to cost and reducing overall petroleum use.''</p>
        <p>The 375,000 tons of asphalt produced each year at the department's Hamilton Avenue plant in Red Hook, Brooklyn, have 35 to 40 percent RAP, Mr. Chin said.</p>
        <p>Inspirational Ads</p>
        <p>Q. A few weeks ago I noticed two New York buses with vanity license plates of an inspirational sort: ''Tryn Hard'' and ''I Dream.'' Was it part of a new campaign to uplift us?</p>
        <p>A. Nice thought, but it was actually a November advertising promotion for a television series on A&amp;E titled ''Random 1.'' The fact that the fake plates pictured on the rear of the buses had real New York State borders evidently led to some confusion.</p>
        <p>The fictitious plates appeared on posters for the show. The plates, larger than life size, had messages like ''Nd A Lift'' and ''Im Lost,'' along with the two you mentioned. ''Random 1'' is a reality show starring two friends who tour the country in a pickup truck, looking for random strangers to help. Hence the ''I Need Help'' theme of the license plates.</p>
