        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The front-page photograph accompanying ''Of Trophy Homes and Unsporting Battles'' illustrates that developers can build very large homes in Briarcliff Manor under the current zoning law. This raises the question of why our mayor, William Vescio, would weaken regulations to allow for even bigger houses more closely spaced.</p>
        <p>While the mayor says he will only ''tweak'' the law, he has advocated significant reductions in setbacks and size limits that would accommodate the non-compliant plan of one influential family.</p>
        <p>For over two years the law has protected every homeowner who lives next to vacant land, a major renovation or a possible ''tear-down.'' With large estates coming on the market, Mr. Vescio's proposed changes will transform the village.</p>
        <p>This is not merely an aesthetic difference over McMansions lining our streets. It is a dispute over whether Briarcliff Manor should sacrifice its open space environment and its protection of existing homeowners' privacy and property values for the benefit of a few people, including Mr. Vescio.</p>
