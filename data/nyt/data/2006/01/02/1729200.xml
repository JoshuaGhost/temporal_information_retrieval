        <p>In ''Big Labor's Big Secret'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 28), Robert Fitch writes: ''Although it is by far the most costly in the world, our health care system still leaves 43 million people uncovered. The latest World Health Organization rankings listed America's system 33rd, below Costa Rica and only two notches above Cuba.''</p>
        <p>His observation takes me back to September 1982, and the first class I took toward earning a master's degree in public health at Yale.</p>
        <p>A noted expert in health care administration began our first lecture with: ''There are just two things wrong with the American health care system. It doesn't care for people's health, and it's not a system.''</p>
        <p>The fact that American health care is even more chaotic 23 years later speaks volumes about the depth of self-serving and special interests plaguing our country's political, business and labor leadership since that time.</p>
