        <p>Five people were hospitalized yesterday after a home heater malfunctioned and blew carbon monoxide gas through a house on Boynton Drive, the police said. The owner of the house, Daniel Roefaro, called 911 just before 11 a.m. and said he, his wife, their two children and a young relative were feeling ill. When officers arrived, they found him outside the house, dazed and incoherent, and the four other people lying about the house, said Sgt. John Drumm of the Livingston Police Department. A crack in the home's heat exchange system caused the carbon monoxide fumes to be pushed inside the house, Sergeant Drumm said. He said the home did not appear to have carbon monoxide detectors. Mr. Roefaro and his family were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital. All were expected to survive, the police said.</p>
