        <p>Nearly 13 months after the State Legislature approved the expansion of the Jacob K.

        <p>Nearly 13 months after the State Legislature approved the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, state and city officials unveiled conceptual plans yesterday to turn the forbidding, black-glass structure on 11th Avenue into a larger, sun-lighted structure with more exhibition space, a tree-lined concourse and cafes.</p>
        <p>The $1.7 billion proposal would double the overall size of the center and increase the amount of exhibition and meeting space to 1.3 million square feet from 790,000 square feet, officials said, enabling the complex to attract more trade shows and conventions. The project would include what would be the city's largest ballroom, which would double as exhibition space.</p>
        <p>The building itself, which stretches along 11th Avenue from 34th Street to 38th Street, would expand not only vertically, but horizontally as well, to 40th Street. Richard Rogers, the architect who is designing the project with FXFowle and A. Epstein &amp; Sons, called the Javits Center a ''mausoleum'' and said the expanded complex would serve as a catalyst for the rebirth of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Javits Development Corporation and the state's chief economic development official, hailed the design as ''an unmatched understanding of the project objectives to create a world-class'' convention center.</p>
        <p>But the estimated cost of the project has swelled from $1.4 billion in December 2004, and some of the elements have changed substantially, touching off a dispute with the man who until recently ran the center, Robert Boyle. Several civic groups, too, are concerned that the plan for the convention center still fails to take advantage of its location next to the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>The initial expansion plan envisioned a 1,500-room convention hotel at 42nd Street and 11th Avenue, where it could also attract tourists and business travelers, and $150 million was set aside to buy the property. But officials now say they would put that money into the convention center itself by placing the hotel in a concrete park owned by the state, directly across 11th Avenue, between 35th and 36th Streets.</p>
        <p>An underground pedestrian tunnel already connects the park to the Javits center.</p>
        <p>The new plans also call for moving the marshalling yard, where truck trailers are parked during trade shows, from the south side of the center to the north side, between 39th and 40th Streets. The new six-story marshalling garage would allow for security checks and for up to 300 trucks to load, unload and park at different levels of the convention center, Mr. Gargano said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the existing marshalling yard on the block between 39th and 40th Streets would be sold to developers, for two office towers, a pair of apartment buildings and a park. Officials believe that a sale could bring in $339 million for the project. Those four buildings, however, may require a long environmental review.</p>
        <p>''It seems that the Javits development corporation is desperate to show action, and they'll do almost anything to get a shovel in the ground,'' said Anna Levin, a member of Community Board 4. ''But the plan they're pursuing would seem to seriously shortchange the Javits.''</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who supports the plan, disagreed. He said the site was an important element of the city's redevelopment plans for the Far West Side and for the creation of a commercial corridor extending from Madison Square Garden west to the Hudson River along 34th Street. The new garage, he said, would help allow the convention center to function more efficiently.</p>
        <p>But relocating the marshalling yard also forced a 20-percent reduction of meeting space. At a legislative hearing in December, Mr. Boyle objected to the reduction, since trade show producers say space has been sorely lacking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyle was removed from the chairmanship of the Javits center operating corporation last month by Gov. George E. Pataki, although he continues to be a board member.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who presides over a legislative committee that oversees state authorities, said the state and city should not rush forward with the new plan, which he described as worse than the prior proposal. He questioned the wisdom of moving the marshalling yard and the hotel site.</p>
        <p>''This project has been botched and delayed,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''This will leave New York with a second-rate convention center and a $1.7 billion price tag.''</p>
        <p>But Joseph Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, which has lobbied for the expansion for more than a decade, said that the industry would oppose any further delays.</p>
        <p>Even so, a coalition of eight civic and community organizations and advocates for parks said that the plan would create a wall seven blocks long separating Midtown from the Hudson River waterfront, the Hudson River Park and the new ferry terminal at 39th Street.</p>
        <p>''They've increased the budget, but the design's still wrong,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. ''It's crazy to put all this money into the park and a new ferry terminal and then block it off from the rest of the city.''</p>
