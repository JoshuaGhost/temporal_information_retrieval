        <p>Shares of Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, dropped 6 percent yesterday after Morgan Stanley Capital International delayed including the company in its widely watched emerging market index, analysts said. Investors had anticipated Gazprom would join the index in February as the most heavily weighted stock, ahead of Samsung of South Korea. Investors sold shares based on news that the re-indexing would be delayed until May, said Leonid Mirzoan, an equity analyst at the Moscow office of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment banking firm. Morgan Stanley delayed the re-indexing because Gazprom was slow to increase the free float of its London-traded stock after a restriction on foreign ownership was lifted this year. Mr. Mirzoan blamed a regulatory glitch. Meanwhile, Gazprom, based in Moscow, reported a 67 percent jump in net profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30, largely because of rising natural gas prices. The company's net profit for the first nine months was $8 billion.</p>
