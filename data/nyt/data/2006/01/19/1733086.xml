        <p>The rest of the world cannot deter the will of the Iranian people to pursue their nuclear program, the country's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday, the official IRNA news agency reported.</p>
        <p>''The West knows very well that we are not seeking to build nuclear weapons,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said in a meeting with Tajikistan's president, Emomali Rahmonov. ''Nuclear weapons are against our political and economic interests and our Islamic beliefs. Therefore, the Islamic Republic will not fear the uproar and will continue the path of scientific progress relying on its principles, and the world cannot influence the will of our people.''</p>

        <p>The rest of the world cannot deter the will of the Iranian people to pursue their nuclear program, the country's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday, the official IRNA news agency reported.</p>
        <p>''The West knows very well that we are not seeking to build nuclear weapons,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said in a meeting with Tajikistan's president, Emomali Rahmonov. ''Nuclear weapons are against our political and economic interests and our Islamic beliefs. Therefore, the Islamic Republic will not fear the uproar and will continue the path of scientific progress relying on its principles, and the world cannot influence the will of our people.''</p>
        <p>The comments were the first by Ayatollah Khamenei reported publicly since last week, when Iran defied an agreement with Britain, France and Germany and broke internationally monitored seals at its nuclear site in Natanz to resume research activities. The three countries have begun drafting a resolution to submit to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, that calls for Iran to be referred to the Security Council for possible punitive actions.</p>
        <p>Iran has warned that if the case is sent to the Security Council, Iran will retaliate by banning United Nations inspectors from visiting its sites and resuming the sensitive work of enriching uranium.</p>
        <p>Iran says it wants to enrich uranium to low levels to produce fuel for its nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki urged Europe to refrain from ''hasty actions,'' referring to the call to send Iran's case to the Security Council.</p>
        <p>''I hope the Europeans have understood Iran's clear and direct message and do not make any hasty decision which would complicate the situation for all sides,'' he said in a meeting with journalists at Parliament, the ISNA news agency reported.</p>
        <p>The foreign minister added that Iran had clarified its willingness to continue negotiations in messages discussing its plans for producing nuclear fuel that it has exchanged with Europe, China, Russia and the nonaligned states of the atomic energy agency.</p>
        <p>Russia and China, both of which have vetoes on the Security Council, are among Iran's allies and Iran hopes they will oppose sanctions.</p>
