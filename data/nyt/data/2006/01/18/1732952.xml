        <p>Selena Roberts Sports of The Times column contends that newly appointed New York Jets coach Eric Mangini, who is only 35 years old, can always blame Jets owner Woody Johnson if his stint is unsuccessful (M)</p>

        <p>TIME management always bewitches the Jets, so it was critical for the team's clumsy hierarchy to whisk Eric Mangini to the podium for his introduction as head coach before a game of telephone could foil their moment.</p>
        <p>Wait another day and risk a stream of calls to Mangini from Al Groh, Pete Carroll, Herman Edwards and the Bill Squared combo of Belichick and Parcells, all whispering some variation of ''Don't do it.''</p>
        <p>As it was, Belichick did bend Mangini's ear Monday night, but apparently not long enough for Coach Rubik's Cube to advise his prodigy against venturing into the same toxic franchise he once coached for 24 hours.</p>
        <p>''It never got to that point,'' Mangini said.</p>
        <p>Did Mangini cut Belichick off? If so, it was an ingenious move by Mangini.</p>
        <p>Some may think he cannot win with the jinxed Jets. In reality, he cannot lose.</p>
        <p>Whatever his experience deficit at age 34, he can teethe on the Jets and grow up to better himself and his salary with another organization, whether pro or college.</p>
        <p>However laughable his résumé -- like his stint as a 23-year-old ball boy -- Mangini can use the same ultimate cover as many of those who have coached in green before him. He can blame failure on the misadventures of the Boy in the Bubble, the owner Woody Johnson.</p>
        <p>Johnson's social awkwardness -- perhaps the byproduct of insular affluence -- is reflected in his every decision, whether he is in miscommunication with his coach or surrounding himself with the Boo Radleys of management: the largely reclusive, rarely vocal triumvirate of Terry Bradway, Jay Cross and Mike Tannenbaum.</p>
        <p>Who can work in this isolating atmosphere of ineptitude?</p>
        <p>It is the Woody defense. And it worked for Edwards.</p>
        <p>Edwards, the dynamic Jets coach of impeccable character, was portrayed as the doomed victim when he departed. It was as if the dysfunction of the Jets was so overwhelming that it forced Edwards to fib to his players about his return and bail on his team with two years left on his deal.</p>
        <p>On a false high road, Edwards declined to divulge the unseemly details of his escape upon arrival in Kansas City on Jan. 9. He invoked the Las Vegas rule, saying, ''What happened in New York stays in New York.''</p>
        <p>True, the Jets have become a lot like Vegas. The Mirage is an icon of Las Vegas like illusion is a landmark of the Jets. Wasn't that the Jets who were indulging Mike Tice in an interview charade while dotting the i's on Mangini's deal Monday?</p>
        <p>One-night stands are acceptable on the Strip, and also a familiar practice among Jets coaches. Make Mangini the seventh Jets coach in 12 years.</p>
        <p>Could Mangini possibly be the answer? Not likely. What the Jets depict as the un-Cola kind of hire -- a young, edgy unknown whose only head-coaching job was in Australia -- is actually a decision in lockstep with the N.F.L. pattern of employment.</p>
        <p>Almost inevitably, N.F.L. teams expunge all images of the last coach by replacing him with an opposite hire in persona. (See the Giants' flip from Jim Fassel to Tom Coughlin two years ago.) Almost on cue, N.F.L. teams must validate their own genius by hiring anyone who has ever worked within the brain waves of Belichick or Parcells. (See Romeo Crennel in Cleveland and Nick Saban in Miami.)</p>
        <p>Mangini isn't a radical hire, just a radical departure from Edwards.</p>
        <p>Edwards is an approachable coach with a mind of his own, N.F.L. folk tales to spin and charisma by the Gatorade bucket.</p>
        <p>Edwards is fire; Mangini is ice. Mindlessly repeating his talking points about commitment, Mangini couldn't conjure one anecdote from his assistant coach life under Belichick or Parcells. Instead, he mouthed catchphrases.</p>
        <p>''I'm not Bill Belichick and I am not Bill Parcells,'' he said. ''I am Eric Mangini. I am going to approach it my way.''</p>
        <p>And yet, Mangini never uttered an original coaching philosophy and wouldn't begin to tread on the delicate matter of Chad Pennington's future.</p>
        <p>The more Mangini spoke, the more he sounded like the puppet of Bradway.</p>
        <p>Exactly what was the timeline behind his hire? ''I think pretty much exactly how Terry said it took place is how it took place,'' Mangini said.</p>
        <p>Did Mangini have the final say on personnel, roster composition or draft picks? ''Terry has the final say on the roster composition and on the draft and personnel matters,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Is Mangini allowed to make any game-day decisions, like wearing a sweatshirt hoodie or leather jacket? It is hard to tell if Mangini's voice will actually carry, if he will have any credibility with Jets players, or if he was hired as a perfect fit for the Jets' hierarchy of awkward communicators.</p>
        <p>''I think he knows something about the culture of football that appeals to us in this building,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Mangini is just what Johnson wanted: the un-Edwards. And the Jets are just what Mangini needed: a cover for his maturation. In three years, tops, Mangini will grow up and leave the Jets' maladjusted nest to succeed elsewhere. It happens all the time.</p>
