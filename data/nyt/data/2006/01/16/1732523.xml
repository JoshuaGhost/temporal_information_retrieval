        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I'm walking down a busy Ninth Avenue during rush hour, and I accidentally jostle a woman pushing a baby carriage when she stops short at a corner. After saying, ''Excuse me,'' I peer into the carriage, where I see what appears to be the back of an exceptionally curly headed blond tot. When I finally pass the woman, I see that the ''tot'' is actually a dog, who's sitting upright in the carriage, happy as can be. There is no actual baby in sight. The woman, who has the harried-mom look down pat, pushes on.</p>
        <p>Dawn Shurmaitis</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A woman walking through Lord &amp; Taylor in Garden City on Long Island amid a crowded after-Christmas sale, obviously burdened by the post-holiday crush, passed a display of hearts, cherubs and chocolate. Turning to her companion, she said: ''Valentine's Day already? That's it. We're leaving.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Shields</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>After a noontime walk-turned-half-jog in a chilly Central Park, I felt the need for a good stretch. I decided to kick out the kinks while waiting for the light to change at Columbus Circle. Right, left, right, left. After all, I said to myself, this is New York, no one will notice, and people do stranger things. As the light turned green and I stepped off the curb, a woman turned to me and said, ''You're hired!''</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Returning to Kennedy Airport from our winter break, we waited endlessly in the bitter cold for our budget pickup van. A shiny black limo pulled up to the curb. In the window, where the client name is customarily posted, was a sign with the word ''Rich.'' ''Why do they have to announce it?'' my little girl asked. ''Isn't it obvious?''</p>
        <p>Ora Shtull</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A variety store in my neighborhood had a sign on its outside wall listing wallpaper, paint and art supplies among its stock. However, the ''W'' and the ''P'' were in a color different from the rest of the sign, and had faded to invisibility, leaving passers-by with the unarguable information that ''allpaper aint Art Supplies.''</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A friend of mine has a housekeeper who was a C.P.A. in Poland but isn't licensed here. She is doing some freelance accounting work for neighbors and clients. Gives new meaning to the term ''laundering money,'' doesn't it?</p>
        <p>R. K. Dillon</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I walk with crutches and am quite large. Despite the crutches, I can sometimes be very helpful, as the following demonstrated.</p>
        <p>One very windy night I was crossing the avenue trying hard to keep my balance in the face of strong winds while being careful of the heavy traffic in my path.</p>
        <p>I found that when the wind was especially strong, all I could do was dig my crutches into the street and wait for the wind to subside. After a moment I discovered an older woman on my side, away from the wind, obviously using me as a shield. When I moved, she did as well. When I stopped, she did, too.</p>
        <p>When we were close enough to the curb, she gave me a big smile, mouthed a ''thank you'' and continued on her way.</p>
