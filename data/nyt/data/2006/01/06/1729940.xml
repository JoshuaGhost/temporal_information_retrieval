        <p>Much has been made of the facts that Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn is the first woman and the first openly gay politician elevated to the second most powerful post in New York City's government.</p>
        <p>But those who know Ms. Quinn know that she is no stranger to the city's political establishment. Even as she has championed socially progressive causes, she has also paid homage to the Democratic Party bosses and union leaders who play a critical role in filling the speaker's chair.</p>
        <p>And in the end, it was Ms. Quinn's success at winning over those political heavyweights that assured her victory over her closest rival, Councilman Bill de Blasio of Brooklyn, who had tried to recruit individual council members to his side. Her success has drawn criticism from some of her colleagues, who say it could leave her beholden to special interests that helped her get the job.</p>
        <p>In her bid for speaker, Ms. Quinn sought out the support of the city's most influential labor leaders, presiding over power breakfasts at the Regency Hotel with Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, and Edward Malloy, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, among others, several political consultants said.</p>
        <p>But it was her assiduous courting of the powerful county party bosses that had the most impact. During Ms. Quinn's installation on the Council floor this week, it was hard to miss Thomas J. Manton, the Democratic leader of Queens, and his counterparts in the Bronx and Brooklyn, Assemblymen Jose Rivera and Vito J. Lopez sitting prominently in the front row like doting uncles. At one point, Ms. Quinn went over and hugged each of them.</p>
        <p>In particular, Ms. Quinn has ingratiated herself with Mr. Manton, a former congressman who all but selected the previous speaker, Gifford Miller, four years ago by forming an alliance with Mr. Rivera. Between them, they can deliver the votes of as many as 21 council members, or just five short of the majority needed to win.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, 39, who represents the West Side of Manhattan, has become a fixture at Queens Democratic meetings and dinners, prompting one Queens councilman to joke that ''if you didn't know her, you wouldn't know she wasn't from Queens.''</p>
        <p>And last month, she was a co-host of a fund-raiser for Congressman Joseph Crowley, who is widely seen as Mr. Manton's protégé. One guest, Representative Nancy Pelosi, even remarked that she looked forward to Ms. Quinn's selection as speaker, several attendees said.</p>
        <p>''She didn't just show up at the last minute,'' said Brian O'Dwyer, a lawyer close to the Queens Democratic leaders. ''She's been developing these relationships for years.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. de Blasio, who also pursued the county political leaders, seemed to focus on running a miniature field campaign within the Council. He surrounded himself with a core group of supporters, and charged them to make his case with the other members.</p>
        <p>As recently as last week, Mr. de Blasio said that he had the votes of 15 council members from Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. But as soon as the Democratic leaders agreed over the weekend to support Ms. Quinn, many of those members began to switch their loyalties.</p>
        <p>''Chris pursued a power leadership strategy, and Bill pursued a grassroots strategy,'' said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor of public policy at Baruch College. ''The bottom line is that the Democratic organizations still have substantial power, and Tom Manton is the kingmaker.''</p>
        <p>The new speaker may also have outmaneuvered Mr. de Blasio when it came to labor unions. Ms. Quinn, whose father was a union shop steward, was known to the unions, having joined picket lines and protests and sponsored legislation to improve heath benefits for grocery workers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. de Blasio has strong union ties of his own. He managed Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for the United States Senate, and sought to use his Democratic Party connections to garner local union support, several political consultants said.</p>
        <p>At the request of several unions, Mr. de Blasio pushed through legislation in November that significantly loosened limits on union campaign donations to political candidates, a move that was sharply criticized by the Campaign Finance Board and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>But by and large, union leaders declined to choose between Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Quinn in the contest for speaker, saying that both of them had been longtime allies.</p>
        <p>For instance, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the politically active union that has become a force in city elections in recent years, made no endorsement despite entreaties from several candidates. In 2001, the union backed Mr. Miller.</p>
        <p>''We stayed neutral,'' said Jennifer Cunningham, an executive vice president of the union. ''We continued to get calls about it, and we made it clear to the county leaders and anyone who asked that we were staying out and deferring to the members of the Council to make that choice.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Central Labor Council waited until the day before Ms. Quinn was installed as speaker to endorse her. By then, the Democratic party bosses had already chosen Ms. Quinn, and the other candidates for speaker had dropped out.</p>
        <p>In what many saw as a nod to Mr. Manton during her acceptance speech, Ms. Quinn described her father's reaction to a news reporter who depicted her as a trailblazer: ''Without missing a beat, my father stuck out his chest and proudly yelled at the TV, 'You forgot Irish, you bum!' '' she said.</p>
        <p>The anecdote brought laughter, and cheers, from Ms. Quinn's colleagues and supporters.</p>
        <p>''She's very much an inside player,'' said Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn, who had also vied for speaker. ''I don't think she ever pretended that she was anything else.''</p>
