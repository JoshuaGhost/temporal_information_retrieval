        <p>Ukraine conceded Tuesday that it had withdrawn natural gas from its pipeline system that Russia said was intended for export to Europe, but said it had a contractual right to the fuel under an agreement with the Central Asian nation of Turkmenistan.</p>
        <p>Both Russia and Turkmenistan export natural gas through Russian pipelines to Ukraine, which customarily takes some for its own use and ships the rest on to other European countries. But Russia cut the flow through the pipeline on Sunday, ostensibly in a dispute with Ukraine over pricing and transit fees. That set off alarm bells throughout Europe during the winter heating season and shook world energy markets' confidence in Russia.</p>
        <p>Russia placed blame for the shortages on Ukraine, saying it stole gas intended for export, but under pressure from European governments, Russia restored full flow to the pipeline on Monday. Despite the bickering, the two countries resumed negotiations on gas prices on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the price of crude oil leapt by more than $2 a barrel on Tuesday in afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, fed by concerns over Russia's reliability. Crude oil prices rose to a two-month high of $63.80 a barrel at midday before pulling back slightly.</p>
        <p>While admitting that they took their usual allotment of gas on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials dismissed Russian claims that the gas had been stolen. Mikola Goncharuk, a member of the board of Ukraine's natural gas company, Naftogaz, said at a news conference in Kiev that his company had indeed drawn down gas from the pipeline system, but under a contract with Turkmenistan. Russian export gas, he said, was untouched.</p>
        <p>''We are demanding the full volume of gas from Turkmenistan today,'' Mr. Goncharuk said. ''For now we can get by without Russian gas.''</p>
        <p>Gazprom, Russia's government-owned gas company, insists that the pipeline carries only Russian gas for export to Europe.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the political fallout continued from Russia's brief gas embargo, which was widely regarded in Europe as punishment of Ukraine for its rejection of Moscow in elections last year and its continued turn to the West and away from the Russian orbit.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the State Department spokesman criticized Russia's use of energy as a foreign policy tool, while Austria and other Central and Eastern European countries agreed to make the diversification of energy supplies a priority, though they did not say how they would achieve it.</p>
        <p>The European Union's top energy official said Tuesday that the pricing dispute could fester for weeks to come, jeopardizing one of the Continent's primary sources of energy. Andris Piebalgs, the energy commissioner, said the agreement by the two sides to resume talks on the issue was ''just a temporary calmdown,'' according to the Bloomberg news agency.</p>
        <p>Each side in the dispute has plausibly blamed the other because the pipeline system, a great achievement of the Soviet Union's postwar industrial expansion, was built as a unified web. After the Soviet Union broke up, the successor states divided the gas flow through treaties and commercial agreements that grew more complex each year.</p>
        <p>Companies subsidized others, shrewd businessmen made millions or billions exploiting price discrepancies, gas utilities became government slush funds and corruption blossomed.</p>
        <p>The gas is sometimes mingled in the web of pipes. In the argument on Tuesday, Ukraine said some of the gas entering its pipeline system had been bought from Turkmenistan and shipped by an intermediary company. Mr. Goncharuk said his company paid last Friday for 126 million cubic meters a day of gas from Turkmenistan, for an unspecified period.</p>
        <p>He said that Ukraine therefore had a right to withdraw that volume of gas from its pipelines, but that it had chosen to take only 90 million cubic meters out of concern for the security of natural gas flows to Europe during the winter.</p>
        <p>The Russian minister of industry and energy, Viktor Khristenko, said Tuesday that Gazprom had contracted the entire export capacity of Turkmenistan for the first quarter of 2006, the Dow Jones news service reported.</p>
        <p>In statements carried in the Russian news media, Turkmenistan's mercurial and authoritarian leader, Saparmurat Niyazov, who presides over a closed nation deep in Central Asia, shed little light on the dispute. He has confirmed sales to Ukraine without elaborating on the discrepancy with Gazprom's statements. Gazprom controls the pipeline leading north from his country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goncharuk also asserted that Ukraine had a right to withdraw additional gas from the pipelines in lieu of transit fees from Russia under a barter agreement reached in 2004 and in force in 2005.</p>
        <p>Volodymyr R. Sidenko, chief economist at the Institute of Economic Forecasting in the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, said: ''Ukraine considers if we have not arrived at any agreement, the old one is in effect. The Russian side rejects these arguments.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the gas dispute has already dented Ukraine's energy-intensive economy. Chemical and metallurgical industries slowed production to reduce demand by 15 to 20 percent, according to a statement by the Ukrainian government.</p>
        <p>While Kiev scored points for withstanding what European nations almost universally regarded as Russia's intimidation tactics, its energy troubles are far from over.</p>
        <p>Natural gas-guzzling steel mills and chemical plants earn much of Ukraine's export revenues. Outdated and inefficient, many have scraped by since the collapse of the Soviet Union only because of cheap energy from Russia. Market-rate energy prices, which Ukrainian officials acknowledge they must pay eventually, could plunge Ukraine back into recession, officials here have said.</p>
        <p>On average, metallurgical plants would become unprofitable at natural gas prices above $105 per 1,000 cubic meters, according to estimates by Mr. Sidenko. The chemical industry would be unprofitable at prices above $85, he said.</p>
        <p>Under the 2005 contract, negotiated before the Orange Revolution, Ukraine pays $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. Gazprom is asking for $220 to $230 now, about double what most other former Soviet states pay.</p>
