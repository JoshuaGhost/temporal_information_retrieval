        <p>JOSIE HOGAN just seems to get skinnier and skinnier.</p>
        <p>In Act 1 of Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' Josie, a Connecticut farm woman, describes herself as ''an ugly lump of a woman'' and mentions that James Tyrone Jr., her alcoholic actor neighbor, goes for ''dainty dolls'' instead.</p>
        <p>I wasn't around to see Wendy Hiller, who starred in the original 1957 Broadway production, but when Colleen Dewhurst played the role in the 1973 Broadway revival, she was a full-figured earth-mother type pushing 50. Beautiful but hardly dainty. Even the formidable and brilliant Cherry Jones, when she starred in the 2000 Broadway revival in her mid-40's, seemed a little too delicate for the character descriptions that O'Neill left behind.</p>
        <p>So in the Long Wharf Theater production at Hartford Stage, Alyssa Bresnahan looks as if she should be starring in ''The Kate Moss Story'' instead. Maybe this is inevitable in an era when size 10 or 12 fashion models are relegated to ''plus size'' shoots and shows. And actresses struggle to stay rail-thin like them.</p>
        <p>At least Ms. Bresnahan does a fairly convincing lumbering walk. And the production, directed by Gordon Edelstein, captures much of the wistful quality and resistance to painful truth that ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' is about.</p>
        <p>Josie, who describes herself as ''the scandal of the neighborhood,'' is unfazed when her brother, running away from home in the first scene, says she'll never find a decent man to marry her because of her widespread (and well-known locally) sexual experience. In fact she laughs about it.</p>
        <p>Josie's father, Phil (Bill Raymond), thinks she may still have a chance. James (James Colby), as part of a New York theater family, may be above the Hogans' station in life, but he visits frequently and certainly seems to enjoy Josie's company. And since he is inheriting all that money, Phil suggests, wouldn't it be a good thing if she could seduce him and make him marry her? James, Phil says, has this crazy idea that Josie is a virgin.</p>
        <p>At first Josie scoffs. But when she and her father hear that James has decided to sell their farm, when he had once promised never to sell it to anyone but them, she reconsiders. And the stage is set for the long moonlit night Josie and James will spend together.</p>
        <p>It is not giving away an important plot point to reveal that they do not end up in bed together, although there is a jarringly violent moment in this staging when Jamie seems to decide they should. What is planned as an evening of deceit becomes a study in illusion instead, and there are more revelations than expected.</p>
        <p>O'Neill claimed to dislike ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' but it is one of his most mature, most complex works. Mr. Edelstein and his cast don't convey all the complexity between O'Neill's lines; it's unlikely that many productions do. This makes it a different play but a worthwhile one nevertheless.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Raymond has fun with O'Neill's humor, which is plentiful. ''I've never yet laid hands on a woman,'' his character tells Josie. ''When I was sober.''</p>
        <p>''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' is at Hartford Stage, 50 Church Street, through Feb. 5. Information: (860) 527-5151 or on the Web at www.hartfordstage.org.</p>
