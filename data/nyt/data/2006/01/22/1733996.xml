        <p>IF you believe most statistics, the national economy is doing quite well. Corporate profits are soaring. Consumer spending and business investment have been growing at a healthy clip. In the third quarter of last year, output expanded at an annual pace of about 4.1 percent. And private-sector economists are expecting growth above 3.5 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Yet, amid the vim and vigor, there is a weak spot that does not quite mesh with these readings. More than four years since the economy emerged from recession in November of 2001, businesses are still not hiring much. Employment grew by a mere 3.5 million jobs, or 2.7 percent, in 49 months' worth of this economic expansion. Last year, the job market grew by 1.5 percent.</p>

        <p>IF you believe most statistics, the national economy is doing quite well. Corporate profits are soaring. Consumer spending and business investment have been growing at a healthy clip. In the third quarter of last year, output expanded at an annual pace of about 4.1 percent. And private-sector economists are expecting growth above 3.5 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Yet, amid the vim and vigor, there is a weak spot that does not quite mesh with these readings. More than four years since the economy emerged from recession in November of 2001, businesses are still not hiring much. Employment grew by a mere 3.5 million jobs, or 2.7 percent, in 49 months' worth of this economic expansion. Last year, the job market grew by 1.5 percent.</p>
        <p>This is not negligible. The unemployment rate, the most frequently used measure of labor-force vitality, dipped to 4.9 percent in December. This is the lowest it has been in more than 30 years except for the prosperous late 1990's, when it fell briefly below 4 percent.</p>
        <p>But compared with similar moments in the nation's economic history, this shot of job growth appears less brisk than at first blush. In the 49 months after the recession of the early 1990's, employment jumped almost 8 percent. It surged by more than 13 percent in the same period after the recession of the early 80's.</p>
        <p>What growth there is comes from a decline in the pace of layoffs, not from employers picking up hiring.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter of last year -- the last period for which there is published data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- employers hired 7.6 million people, still almost a million less than the average pace of hiring in the second half of the 90's.</p>
        <p>And even as the declining unemployment rate seems to indicate plenty of opportunity in the labor market, workers' wages are still treading water, especially along the bottom rungs of the income scale, suggesting there remains substantial slack in the labor market.</p>
        <p>In fact, wage growth has slowed. According to Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, growth in the median wage dropped to 2.4 percent in 2004 and 2005, from about 3 percent, on average, in 2002 and 2003, the first two years after the end of the recession.</p>
        <p>In real terms, taking inflation into account, wages have declined in the last two years across all pay scales except for the very top earners, according to Mr. Bernstein's crunching of census data. Last year, the wages of ordinary workers in production jobs and other nonmanagement positions declined by 0.4 percent, after accounting for inflation.''By some measures, the economic expansion has been impressive,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''That employers are still so cautious about hiring is extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>PART of the sluggishness of workers' wages is a result of the rising burden of health care benefits.</p>
        <p>In a study last year, Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra, economists at Dartmouth College, found that rising premiums of employer-supplied health insurance were not only eating into workers' compensation, but they also discouraged employers from increasing their payroll.</p>
        <p>This is hardly the whole story. Productivity is growing at breakneck speed, much faster than what usually happens this late in an economic expansion.</p>
        <p>Even if you include the growing share of benefits, compensation of workers in the private sector rose by merely 3 percent in the third quarter of last year compared with a year earlier, says the latest reading of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employee compensation index.</p>
        <p>That's the smallest increase in nearly seven years.</p>
        <p>As a share of national income, workers' wages and salaries are 2 percentage points below where they were in 2000. Meanwhile, corporate profits have escalated to levels not seen in more than half a century. In the third quarter of last year, profits after tax rose to 9.6 percent of national income, the highest corporate share since 1950.</p>
        <p>Some economists suspect that the lingering effect of technology breakthroughs spurring productivity growth may still be weighing on employers' appetite for hiring. Others speculate that competition from cheap labor markets like China is impelling American companies to become more productive by wringing more out of their existing work forces, and weakening workers' general bargaining position.</p>
        <p>Despite the apparent conundrum, however, the explanations for the labor market's current weakness may be more straightforward. Two dynamics emerge as likely drivers: one is the impact of a relatively strong dollar on trade -- stimulating imports and hindering exports. The other is the investment bust after the dot-com boom.</p>
        <p>Trade has long been a tempting explanation for America's labor market woes. Since September 2001, exports have increased 40 percent, but imports have grown 60 percent. The overall trade deficit, now running above $60 billion a month, represents a substantial portion of American demand going to foreign suppliers.</p>
        <p>Yet Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, argues that the main contributor to the story is the shock to business spending as the Internet economy shriveled.</p>
        <p>The dot-com boom encouraged a feast of business investment in all sorts of technological applications. It also spurred exuberant hiring. When it popped, debt-saddled companies emerged from the recession with a decided focus on paying down debt and shoring up their balance sheets. Hiring was far from their minds.</p>
        <p>''At the Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1990's, we knew there was going to be a period of adjustment,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''In a sense, we had an excessively strong labor market; there had to be this wringing-out period.''</p>
        <p>Actually, this reading of the economic tea leaves allows for a bit of optimism.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a business research group in Arlington, Va., argues that the sluggishness of the labor market looks less like an aberration if you believe that the recession ended in the middle of 2003 instead of November 2001, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group that measures when recessions begin and end.</p>
        <p>Manufacturing's doldrums extended at least until then -- with industrial production in the manufacturing sector falling by roughly 5 percent between the middle of 2000 and the middle of 2003, as corporate investment plunged and exports sagged.</p>
        <p>In those three years, manufacturing lost 2.4 million jobs, accounting for 80 percent of the decline in employment across the economy.</p>
        <p>MANUFACTURING is not out of the woods. It lost 50,000 jobs last year. But since the middle of the 2003, overall job growth looks more like the first months after the end of the recession of the early 1990's. Companies also started to spend more on capital goods since then.</p>
        <p>Exports have grown by more than 10 percent in the last two years, up from 4 percent in 2003. The cycle seems to be turning more favorable for labor. ''If you consider an eight-month recession from March to November of 2001, then the comparison with past cycles is weak,'' Mr. Meckstroth said. ''But if you believe the recession was much longer than that, then you get something that doesn't look nearly as bad.''</p>
