        <p>Think of it as the fight for the Bionic Baby Boomer.</p>
        <p>From head to toe, aging boomers are being kept alive and kicking -- or at least walking -- by an expanding array of devices that combine the newest medical knowledge with the latest breakthroughs in digital electronics and material sciences.</p>
        <p>Already, the medical device field has become one of the most innovative and profitable segments of the economy. And as wave after wave of baby boomers enter their prime health care spending years, the medical device market is expected to grow by double digits for years to come.</p>
        <p>That trend more than any other may explain the current bidding war for the medical device maker Guidant. Many analysts have questioned the financial sanity of Boston Scientific's latest offer: $27 billion. Guidant's original suitor, Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose most recent offer was around $25 billion, has until midnight Tuesday to indicate whether it will make yet another bid for the company.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Guidant is a damaged company. Its market share has plunged, and its potential legal liabilities have mounted, after disclosures of fatal product defects that executives evidently knew about long before notifying doctors. But Guidant's continuing allure is its prime location in the booming medical device industry.</p>
        <p>The industry's sweet spot now is the $10 billion market for implanted devices that regulate heartbeats; Guidant has been second only to Medtronic in that field. Forecasts call for that market to expand by 15 percent annually for the next five years, with the fastest growth likely to come from the most expensive and profitable products.</p>
        <p>Guidant is also a player in the $7.6 billion market for balloon devices that can be threaded through arteries to clear blockages in blood vessels, and for the tiny metal cylinders called stents that are inserted to keep those vessels from reclosing. The worldwide market for such devices is expected to top $10 billion by 2010.</p>
        <p>The fight for Guidant, though, is only one sign of the boom in medical devices. Even products that have been on the market for decades, like artificial hips and knees, are undergoing technology-driven makeovers.</p>
        <p>The industry ranges from inexpensive equipment like disposable syringes, crutches and home pregnancy test kits to $1.3 million robotic surgery machines used to remove cancerous prostate glands and equally expensive M.R.I. diagnostic machines that can cost additional hundreds of thousands of dollars to install.</p>
        <p>But right now the financial spotlight is on cardiovascular devices like Guidant's, which treat breakdowns in the heart and circulatory system associated with aging and progressive diseases like diabetes. Drug-coated stents like Taxus from Boston Scientific are estimated to have profit margins approaching 90 percent. Heart-regulating devices like those made by Guidant, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical can cost $25,000 or more and carry gross margins as high as 70 percent.</p>
        <p>The market enthusiasm for medical devices is a bright contrast to the currently cloudy outlook for many traditional drug companies and biotechnology start-ups, which have hit snags in developing major new products.</p>
        <p>''Devices are an area where technology rapidly fuses with medicine,'' said Amit Hazan, an analyst at Suntrust Robinson Humphrey in New York who focuses primarily on device companies with market values below $1 billion. With big companies like Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson looking to grow by acquiring new product lines and few major medical device players like Guidant for sale, Wall Street has come to regard many of the smaller fry as prime takeover candidates.</p>
        <p>''The index of small-cap companies I follow was up over 40 percent last year,'' Mr. Hazan said.</p>
        <p>As always when markets start looking giddy, there are caution flags. Many doctors say that some of the device industry's innovations, as with a number of drugs, are being marketed too aggressively. Often, too, regulators approve devices based on relatively short-term evidence of benefits that may not end up justifying their costs.</p>
        <p>And some costs are commonly overlooked. Companies like Guidant, for example, are selling ever more sophisticated heart regulating devices. New features include ones enabling the units to deliver more varied forms of stimulation to more regions of the heart. But doctors say the new features, which can add thousands of dollars to a device's cost and more rapidly drain the battery, are often never employed. Besides the burden on the checkbook of the patient or -- more likely, the insurer -- the battery-sapping features may require a patient to have a replacement operation in three or four years instead of six or seven.</p>
        <p>And compared with their ties to the drug industry, doctors are much more involved with device companies in developing new products and making improvements to older ones. The sometimes tangled relationships can speed innovation. But they can also lead to overly aggressive use of new products and procedures on patients who might have benefited as well, or better, from other, less profitable treatments.</p>
        <p>Even if insurers and regulators bring some of the excesses to heel, the device companies will continue to be fueled by the same baby boomer demographics on which traditional drug companies and the newer biotechnology industry are also placing their hopes.</p>
        <p>Wall Street firms like Lazard Capital Markets project that the number of Americans over age 60 will increase by at least 30 percent over the next eight years. On average, they will spend more on health care between the ages of 60 and 70 than they did in all their previous decades combined. And by the time they are 85, they will each be spending over $16,000 annually -- more than their average bills for food or shelter, according to Alexander K. Arrow, the device industry analyst at Lazard.</p>
        <p>''Baby boomers are descending upon the health care infrastructure of the United States like locusts upon a cornfield,'' Mr. Arrow wrote in an industry overview he published last month.</p>
        <p>As recently as the 1990's, Wall Street was watching the boomer demographic wave mainly for its impact on big drug companies. They flourished as the number of $1 billion drugs jumped from 4 in 1992 to 55 in 2000. Health care investors with a tolerance for risk flocked to biotechnology companies like Amgen, Genentech and Biogen that were using novel methods to create drugs.</p>
        <p>And many of the drug makers that did own device companies viewed them as a drag on growth. Eli Lilly split off Guidant in 1994, and in 2001 Bristol-Myers Squibb did the same with Zimmer Holdings, now the largest maker of hips and other artificial joints.</p>
        <p>But since 2000, earnings growth has slowed for drug makers as blockbuster drugs of the 1990's came off patent and successors proved hard to find. In the meantime, leading device companies have proved adept at racking up year after year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth. Unlike drug makers, device company can continually tinker with hit products to produce a steady stream of incremental improvements that can be used to justify price increases.</p>
        <p>And unlike drugs, devices can be designed with electronic components that link them to computers and communications networks, allowing data from patients with implants to be monitored remotely. Guidant's innovations in such patient monitoring and networking, marketed under the Latitude brand name, are among the enhancements it is counting on to help rebuild market share.</p>
        <p>Stock activity in the last five years attests to the diverging fortunes of drug and device makers. From the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2005, the share price of Pfizer, the largest drug company, declined 10.7 percent, while the stock of Medtronic, the largest independent device company, was rising 63.2 percent.</p>
        <p>During the same period Lilly's share price declined 4.3 percent (assuming dividends were reinvested) while the stock of Guidant, its device offspring, climbed more than 40 percent. Bristol-Myers's stock fell more than 53 percent, while Zimmer's rose more than 135 percent.</p>
        <p>Many of the most successful devices emerged in response to the limitations of drugs. Balloon angioplasty and stents clear blockages in blood vessels where blood-thinning drugs can no longer maintain flow. Pacemakers and defibrillators correct heartbeat abnormalities that are impossible to manage chemically. Spinal fusion devices and, more recently, artificial spinal disks have become treatments of last resort in patients for whom drugs and exercise can no longer control back pain.</p>
        <p>Device makers frequently get clearance to sell new products far more easily than drug makers. That is partly because devices rarely have broad side effects. In addition, most new devices are classified as variations on previously approved products, while each new drug is considered a chemically novel substance requiring a full review of its safety and efficacy.</p>
        <p>Regulators have allowed even devices with relatively low or short-term success rates to enter the market after makers positioned them as therapies of last resort. That happened last year with the Food and Drug Administration's controversial approval of Cyberonics' electrical stimulator of the vagus nerve, used to treat depression in cases where drug therapy has failed.</p>
        <p>Few drug makers have a clearer view of these dynamics than Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose vast health care empire includes pharmaceuticals -- 44 percent of revenue through the first three quarters of last year -- but whose many device divisions already contribute more than a third of its revenue and are collectively bigger than Medtronic, the largest independent device company.</p>
        <p>Now Johnson &amp; Johnson's working knowledge of the device market is being put to the test, as the company assesses how much value even a damaged Guidant is worth in the Battle for the Bionic Boomer.</p>
