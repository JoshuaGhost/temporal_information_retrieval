        <p>West Virginians began burying their fallen miners on Sunday, mourning their losses but celebrating the lives and legacies of men who prided themselves on making a living by harvesting coal from deep within the earth.</p>
        <p>In the mountain hamlets surrounding the Sago Mine, hundreds of mourners turned out for the funerals of 6 of the 12 men who died there last week. But the grief, sympathy and prayers extended well beyond the funerals, most of them private services from which reporters were banned.</p>
        <p>White ribbons and bows adorned utility poles in Buckhannon, and dozens of roadside signs conveyed the somber mood. ''Healing hurts,'' one sign said outside a doughnut shop here. One just north of town read, ''God just got 12 new angels.''</p>
        <p>At the service for Jesse L. Jones, a 44-year-old miner from Pickens, the Rev. Donald Butcher, pastor of Sand Run Baptist Church, spoke the names of each of the 12 men killed at the mine and spoke of their way of making a living and making a life.</p>
        <p>''You see, coal miners are a different breed of men; they don't have any fear,'' Mr. Butcher said to about 200 mourners at a funeral chapel just north of the mine. Miners, he said, give us electricity for lights as well as powerful lessons on working tirelessly, no matter the circumstances.</p>
        <p>''God gives us people who are heroes, and we don't even realize it,'' he said. ''We got lots of coal miners here with us today. America is great because of this profession and because of men like Jesse, who put their lives on the line.''</p>
        <p>The pastor spoke of one of Mr. Jones's grandfathers, who was killed in a mine explosion, and of members of his own family, one of whom lost his sight and others who lost their fingers mining.</p>
        <p>The other miners buried Sunday were Alva Martin Bennett, 51; Jerry Groves, 56; David Lewis, 28; Martin Toler, 51; and Jack Weaver, 52.</p>
        <p>At Sago Baptist Church, where inaccurate first reports of the survival of 12 miners brought euphoria that later turned to grief, the Rev. Wease Day stood in front of a huge picture of the Last Supper during regular Sunday morning services and tried to make sense of it all.</p>
        <p>Wearing a blue tie with the face of Jesus on it, Mr. Day told the congregation, ''The other night when we received what we all believed to be good news, we all shouted and rejoiced, but you know when the other news came it broke our hearts as well.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, God would never forsake his people and was with them throughout the heartbreaking ordeal even if they could not understand or answer the unanswerable questions.</p>
        <p>''Many times people think, 'Well, it was God's fault,' '' Mr. Day said, ''but God has a master plan, and everything comes together in that master plan. He was in control every minute.</p>
        <p>''We were in this building the other night and it came to mind that the spirit was so great here and it was so great outside and God had just covered these old hilltops with his holy spirit, his holy power.''</p>
        <p>After the service, the church bells rang 12 times, echoing through the mountains. Just down the road near the entrance to the Sago Mine, 12 black ribbons hung from a fence.</p>
        <p>Even as the towns mourned their dead, people kept praying for the recovery of the sole survivor of the mine disaster, Randal McCloy Jr., 26. Doctors at West Virginia University Hospitals, where Mr. McCloy is being treated, said that he remained in critical condition Sunday night but that his heart, lung and muscle functions had improved.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCloy was breathing on his own, and doctors had stopped sedating him.</p>
        <p>At First United Methodist Church, the pastor, the Rev. Mark Flynn, told congregants that he had been with the families of the miners almost nonstop for three days.</p>
        <p>''I went to Sago to minister to those families, and they ministered to me,'' Mr. Flynn said. ''I was touched by the strength, the love and the wisdom. In those dark days and nights at the Sago Baptist Church, I saw some light. I saw light in the faith and love of the family members with whom I talked.</p>
        <p>''Their faith was not just a vague notion that somehow everything would turn out as they wished. These people believe that they and their loved ones were in the hands of God, no matter what happened in that mine.''</p>
