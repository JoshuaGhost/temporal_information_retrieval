        <p>Armed bandits mugged two men in two separate robberies in Central Park last night, stealing about $500 and beating one of the victims, the police said. The victim of the first robbery, a 63-year-old man, was walking southbound on the East Drive near 106th Street about 6 p.m. when two men, who appeared to be 18 to 20 years old, approached him demanding his money, one brandishing a gun. They took about $250 and fled. Around 8:30 p.m., a 52-year-old man walking on the 72nd Street Drive near the Bethesda Fountain was approached by five men, one of whom pointed a gun at him. They told him to lie on the ground, demanded his money and punched and kicked him. His wallet, containing about $300, cellphone and watch were stolen. The police said last night that no arrests had been made.</p>
