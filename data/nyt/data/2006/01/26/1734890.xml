        <p>Tiger Woods was up before the sun Wednesday, leaving footprints in the dewy grass of Torrey Pines Golf Course.

        <p>Tiger Woods was up before the sun Wednesday, leaving footprints in the dewy grass of Torrey Pines Golf Course. After hitting his tee shot on the fourth hole of his pro-am round, he stopped along the bluffs above the Pacific Ocean and looked westward as sunlight began to dapple the vista in front of him.</p>
        <p>For several minutes, Woods did not move. The memories here are rich: The trips to Torrey Pines at age 12 with his parents, the recognition of how the meeting of water and land can turn a place of competition into a moment of contemplation.</p>
        <p>''You know, I grew up here in Southern Cal, not too far away from the beach,'' said Woods, who recently purchased a $38 million property in Jupiter Island, Fla. ''It's something I've always had my entire life -- always been close to the ocean.''</p>
        <p>Woods has chosen to make his 2006 debut at the Buick Invitational, and he appears as reflective as ever as he enters his 10th full year on the PGA Tour beginning Thursday.</p>
        <p>During a brief off-season after he won six times in 2005, Woods went 24 days without touching a golf club, one of the longest stretches of his life without even a cursory swing in the living room. Woods says that his desire to win remains strong, but there are more varied aspects in his life than when he turned professional in 1996.</p>
        <p>Woods is 30 now, and he married Elin Nordegren in October 2004. Their new home, a 10-acre property that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway, is the largest single residential sale in Martin County.</p>
        <p>Instead of only grinding through practices, Woods speaks more of his life outside the ropes -- of his improved form as a skier, of the children's learning center that will open in his name next month in Anaheim, Calif., of the break that allowed him precious time with his father, Earl, who has cancer.</p>
        <p>''Dad is doing better,'' Woods said during a news conference Wednesday. ''He's my best friend. Any time you can spend as much time with your parents that you truly love, especially when he wasn't feeling all that well, it meant the world to me.''</p>
        <p>Woods has more to balance these days, but maybe no golfer is better equipped to handle the outside demands while also keeping the competitive spirit that has separated him from his peers. During the news conference that stretched to an hour, Buick, one of his sponsors, unveiled several television commercials starring Woods and a bevy of fans begging to win a car from him.</p>
        <p>During his pro-am earlier in the day, Woods was giving swing tips to the actor Kevin James one minute and hitting a driver off the deck the next.</p>
        <p>Even as he upholds his many obligations, there are rounds to play and Jack Nicklaus's records to chase.</p>
        <p>''Generally speaking, when someone gets to be a little older, they seem to do a better job of controlling and managing what they do,'' Nicklaus said in a recent e-mail message. ''They understand how to play the game and how to go about playing the game. It just takes a while to learn how to do that.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine Tiger being any different. He's a very smart young man. He understands the value of patience and experience.''</p>
        <p>Woods said: ''I've put myself in so many different scenarios and have been successful and have failed, and I've had to learn from both. Why did I fail? Because of this. Why did I succeed? Because of this.</p>
        <p>''My father has always harped on me, 'Always be honest with yourself, true to yourself, look yourself in the mirror.' Some days are tougher than others. When you know you've absolutely messed up, you have to admit it and move on and learn and apply. And I've done that.''</p>
        <p>Beginning Thursday, Woods will stand inside the ropes on a golf course that has given him 3 of his 46 career PGA Tour victories, including last year's Buick Invitational. His shots will be analyzed and a season-long march will begin.</p>
        <p>But to hear Woods tell it, the scores that he posts are only one part of who he is, a child prodigy growing up, dealing with life's complexities, thankful for another sunrise.</p>
        <p>''Golf has been merely a vehicle for me to gain awareness for our foundation,'' Woods said of the learning center that will give children a place to study. ''That's what I would ultimately like to be remembered for. Not for hitting high draws and fades, but the people I was able to help and change lives in a positive way.''</p>
