        <p>Antitrust officials have raided the offices of some of Europe's largest gas companies as part of an investigation of the energy sector, the European Commission said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Receiving surprise visits on Tuesday were Gaz de France, E.On Ruhrgas and RWE of Germany, Distrigas and Fluxys of Belgium and OMV of Austria.</p>
        <p>Companies in Italy were also raided, the commission said, but it did not reveal any names.</p>
        <p>In addition, the commission said it raided the offices of Hungarian electricity, with Hungarian news reports naming the wholesale supplier MVT and the grid operator.</p>
        <p>Describing the raids as ''a preliminary step,'' the commission said in a statement that the companies might have abused their dominant positions in their local markets. Over the last five years, the European Union has been pushing for deregulation of the energy industry, in an effort to create single market across the union.</p>
        <p>For Distrigas, the raid on its head office in Brussels was part of the third such inquiry into its behavior in the Belgian market.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the commission also accused Distrigas of forcing industrial clients to sign unfairly long contracts.</p>
        <p>Thierry Rotsart, a company spokesman, confirmed the latest raid of the Brussels office of Distrigas but declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>In response to the accusations made Tuesday, Distrigas said in a statement that its contracts with industrial clients reflected their needs.</p>
        <p>''As a gas merchant, Distrigas' primary aim is to continue to meet the expectations of all its customers. Today more than ever, customers are looking for competitiveness and visibility of prices as well as security of supply,'' the company said.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Todd, the commission's competition spokesman, said long-term contracts, like those offered by Distrigas, might exclude competitors from the most lucrative contracts. Similar tactics are being examined in the other investigations, he said.</p>
        <p>Other signs of market abuse may include capacity constraints on gas storage facilities and the lack of gas connectors. These tactics might allow companies to engage in illegal ''market sharing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Todd said the investigations into the gas companies could last more than a year.</p>
        <p>The commission's sectorwide inquiry is scheduled to conclude at the end of this year. Mr. Todd said he would not rule out further individual investigations of energy firms before the end of the general inquiry.</p>
