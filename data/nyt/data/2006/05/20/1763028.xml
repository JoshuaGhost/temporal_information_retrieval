        <p>A large transformer fire broke out yesterday on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, shutting down parts of the highway and snarling traffic for hours as baseball fans headed to the Mets-Yankees game at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>The fire started about 3 p.m. in a transformer vault at 167th Street in Kew Gardens, causing flames to reach a busy overpass nearby at the height of the afternoon commuter rush, fire officials said. At least three lanes were closed in both directions, and traffic had to be diverted to local streets for several hours as firefighters worked.</p>

        <p>A large transformer fire broke out yesterday on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, shutting down parts of the highway and snarling traffic for hours as baseball fans headed to the Mets-Yankees game at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>The fire started about 3 p.m. in a transformer vault at 167th Street in Kew Gardens, causing flames to reach a busy overpass nearby at the height of the afternoon commuter rush, fire officials said. At least three lanes were closed in both directions, and traffic had to be diverted to local streets for several hours as firefighters worked.</p>
        <p>No mass transit disruptions or injuries were reported, but a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation said the agency was trying to determine if the overpass had sustained any damage.</p>
        <p>A Hazmat team was also called in to determine if the transformer contained asbestos or other toxic chemicals.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the transportation department said that the eastbound section of the parkway was reopened by the end of the game. But westbound lanes remained closed while investigators inspected the overpass, and it was unclear when they would reopen.</p>
