        <p>DEBBIE SHERNOFF pulls her black Hummer up to the curb and lifts up the rear door. Out come the bass drum, the tom-toms, the floor tom, the snare drum and the cymbal set. Another night, another show for her 14-year-old son, Matt, and his rock band, Stone Mountain Terror, named for the Shernoffs' suburban cul-de-sac in nearby Marlton.</p>
        <p>Move over, soccer moms, there's a new breed behind the wheel of the S.U.V.: roadie moms.</p>
        <p>''I'm just here to schlep,'' Mrs. Shernoff said. ''I go where I'm told.'' Her arms were filled with cymbal stands, as Stone Mountain Terror assembled for a battle of the bands competition at Fusion, a performing arts school in an industrial park here.</p>
        <p>Across New Jersey, moms -- and dads, too -- are hauling amps, guitars and drum kits to their offspring's rock gigs with the same doting enthusiasm displayed by parents who shiver on the sidelines at a Thanksgiving soccer tournament or sacrifice much of December to ''Nutcracker'' performances.</p>
        <p>Schools like Fusion and, on a bigger scale, the Paul Green School of Rock Music, a national chain founded by the Philadelphia instructor who became the inspiration for the 2003 film ''School of Rock,'' are incubators for young musicians, where they not only learn an instrument but also often form groups as well.</p>
        <p>While sports and the classical arts have traditionally lent themselves to parental involvement, heavy-metal parenting would seem to be laden with irony, as if parents were co-opting what once was youth's chief form of rebellion.</p>
        <p>''There's no generation gap now,'' Ms. Shernoff said as she unloaded her son's drum set. ''Rock music is not offensive to us. We still go to concerts, and we enjoy it.''. She said she still feels horribly guilty about missing his last performance because she went to see a show in Atlantic City by the bands Heart and Alice in Chains.</p>
        <p>Her own mother does not seem to share her enthusiasm. Though she did attend one of her grandson's performances, Ms. Shernoff said, ''I don't think she'll be back anytime soon.''</p>
        <p>While rock 'n' roll has long been an outlet for teenagers, even younger children are now plugging in. Richard Schaafsma, 9, of Wyckoff, plays drums in a group called The Shrimps, an activity that keeps him and other fledgling rockers out of trouble, says his mother, Gina Schaafsma.</p>
        <p>''They don't get into the trouble we did when we were young because they're not sitting around behind someone's garage,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''Now there are places to do the things they want to do.''</p>
        <p>Richard is one of the younger students at the Paul Green branch in South Hackensack, one of four in New Jersey. It charges $235 a month for a combination of weekly lessons and supervised rehearsals.</p>
        <p>''The parents love that this is a safe and creative place where they can drop off their kids without worrying about what they're doing,'' said Linda Randazzo, who manages the branch in Cherry Hill, which the members of Stone Mountain Terror attend. It opened in January 2005 with 11 students; today there are 110.</p>
        <p>''The parents are an important part of this,'' Ms. Randazzo said. ''They pay the bills, but they also devote their time taking the kids back and forth as much as is needed.''</p>
        <p>Matt Shernoff's parents took him to his first rock concert -- a performance by Rush -- when he was 9. ''The next day he said, 'I want to learn that,' and he bugged me and bugged me and bugged me and eventually we caved in,'' Ms. Shernoff said.</p>
        <p>At the time, she and her husband, Mark, were already ice hockey parents. Matt continued with that sport and all its equipment for several more years until switching to drums, the most cumbersome of the rock instruments.</p>
        <p>''I already had the big truck for hockey,'' said Ms. Shernoff, who is so supportive of Matt's music that she let him stage a backyard music festival called Mattstock for 200 teenagers last October. Stone Mountain Terror is planning another festival, an indoor event at a local school, in June.</p>
        <p>Much of the heavy lifting for Stone Mountain Terror is done by Bennett Reisman, whose son, Mike, 15, plays guitar with the band. Mr. Reisman arrived for the battle of the bands with the back of his cargo van filled with amplifiers, including a 47-pound Vox head, a speaker cabinet and Mike's six-string Gibson Flying V guitar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reisman keeps a dolly in the van, and he and his son, in a well-rehearsed pattern, moved the equipment into the Fusion school. Within minutes, Mr. Reisman was dismissed.</p>
        <p>''That's it: you're off the clock,'' Mike announced, and his father headed off to dinner.</p>
        <p>Some of the less-savory aspects of rock culture, especially lyrics referring to sex and drugs, can be stumbling blocks for some parents. While Ms. Schaafsma said 9-year-old Richard ''has not picked up on that stuff yet,'' Alison Cohen of Fair Lawn, whose 12-year-old son, Eric, plays guitar, refused to let him sing the Grateful Dead song ''Casey Jones,'' which contains the words, ''Driving that train, high on cocaine.'' She held firm even when another mother argued that the song actually has an antidrug message, warning of ''trouble ahead.''</p>
        <p>''I thought it was inappropriate,'' Mrs. Cohen said in a telephone interview. ''Cocaine is bad, period. I don't know why he has to be singing about it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schaafsma said the teenagers she sees at her son's rock school seem as wholesome as many of those following more-conventional pursuits, including sports.</p>
        <p>''It's almost the opposite of what you would think,'' she said. ''The bands give these kids something to do, something they're good at, and it makes them feel good about themselves.''</p>
        <p>Until their children are old enough to drive, she said, parent roadies are allowed at least a foot in the door of their teenagers' closely guarded personal lives.</p>
        <p>''At soccer, the moms sit on the sidelines and talk to the other moms and they look up and clap if their kid does something,'' Ms. Schaafsma said. ''With us, we're at all the shows clapping and at home we're there helping them rehearse. We're driving just as much as the soccer moms. We're probably even more involved.''</p>
        <p>Roadie parents take just as much pride in a well-done drum solo or guitar riff as other parents do in a game-winning play or a starring role in the high school musical. The pride is felt by other relatives, too.</p>
        <p>''There is this incredible rush when the band takes the stage,'' said Anne O'Connell of Washington Township in Bergen County, who serves as a self-described grunt for her 12-year-old nephew, Corey O'Connell, another student at the Bergen County branch of the Paul Green school, who plays guitar.</p>
        <p>Though Corey's parents, who are divorced, both attend concerts, Ms. O'Connell goes the extra mile: she is the Linda McCartney of the band, with at least 700 photos of the fledgling rockers.</p>
        <p>''When they're out there playing, it makes your hair stand up on your arms,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''You get all choked up. It's amazing how these kids can learn this adult music and play it well.''</p>
        <p>At the end of a long, loud evening, Ms. Shernoff was in the audience as Stone Mountain Terror won the battle of the bands. She allowed herself a few short whoops and some clapping. ''But that's about it,'' she said. ''Otherwise Matt will yell at me.''</p>
        <p>Matt Shernoff said he and the rest of the band know they owe a lot to their diehard fans.</p>
        <p>''The parents do a lot,'' he said. ''They help with the driving and they support us even when we practice.''</p>
        <p>Then the teenager's independent streak asserted itself: ''It's good having them involved and I think we all appreciate it, but there are times we'd rather have them leave us alone.''</p>
