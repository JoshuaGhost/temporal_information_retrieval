        <p>A TASTE OF SUMMER -- By tomorrow, the end of the Memorial Day holiday period, United States airlines will have carried 21 million passengers domestically and internationally since May 22, which the travel industry defines as the start of the holiday. The passenger count, an estimate from the Air Transport Association, will be almost 2 percent higher than last year's Memorial Day traffic record, mostly because of higher demand for international travel, the trade group says. The Transportation Security Administration, meanwhile, says it is gearing up to process a record 200 million air passengers during the peak summer travel season through Labor Day.</p>
        <p>HOTEL BOTTOM LINES -- Last year was the most profitable ever for the domestic hotel industry, says Smith Travel Research. The industry had $122.7 billion in revenue and $22.6 billion in profit in 2005, slightly higher than the previous record in 2000. But a research report issued last week by PKF Hospitality Research raises a caution flag. ''Expenses continue at a level more than twice that of inflation, causing concern for hotel owners and operators,'' PKF says.</p>
        <p>ONLINE IN THE LIMO -- LimoLiner, which operates 28-seat luxury shuttle vans between New York and Boston, said it had upgraded free onboard high-speed wireless systems on its fleet to provide connectivity at 700 kilobits a second. The connection is continuous, says the company, which charges $79 each way for the four-hour trip.</p>
        <p>CONTINENTAL NO. 4 -- Based on passenger traffic through the end of April, Continental Airlines surpassed Northwest Airlines to become the fourth-largest domestic carrier. Continental reported 24.6 billion revenue passenger miles -- representing one paying passenger flown one mile -- through April 30, a 12.8 percent increase over the same period last year. Northwest, long the No. 4 airline, had 23 billion revenue passenger miles, a decrease of 6.2 percent.</p>
        <p>ET CETERA -- To promote its revamped Web site, Frontier Airlines is offering double miles and free DirectTV (a 24-channel video service that usually costs $5) to customers who book on the site, Frontierairlines.com. Frontier says it hopes the new site will increase Web bookings by 40 percent in the next year, yielding significant savings in its distribution costs. Frequent flier miles earned through credit-card partnerships, rather than by flying, now account for 60 percent of the miles accrued in major airline frequent flier programs, a new study by IdeaWorks says. United Airlines says it expects to begin offering nonstop service to Kuwait from its hub at Washington-Dulles International Airport three times a week. It starts in late October, says United, which plans to operate the service with a Boeing 777 configured with 10 first-class, 45 business-class, 84 ''economy plus'' and 114 coach seats.</p>
