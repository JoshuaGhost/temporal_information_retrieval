        <p>John Faso's campaign for governor continued to gain steam yesterday, with the announcement that Mr. Faso had secured the support of the Erie County Republican Committee.</p>
        <p>The endorsement came three days before the state Republican convention is to get under way in Hempstead with Mr. Faso and William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, vying to be the party's nominee. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Faso was viewed by some as a long shot, but he has steadily picked up important endorsements, making a Republican primary all but certain.</p>
        <p>Any candidate receiving 25 percent of the delegate vote gets an automatic spot on the primary ballot, though a candidate who wins a majority of the delegates can claim to be the party's choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faso, a former assemblyman from the Hudson Valley, and his allies say that his campaign is hoping to secure a majority of votes. But some Republican leaders have publicly worried that Mr. Faso, who opposes abortion rights and secured the Conservative Party's nomination at their convention last week, would be viewed as far too conservative to put up a battle against Eliot Spitzer, the likely Democratic nominee.</p>
        <p>''We are going to work hard to secure support and continue until the votes start on Thursday,'' said Susan Del Percio, a spokeswoman for Mr. Faso.</p>
        <p>Erie County, which includes Buffalo, carries less than 6 percent of the weighted vote at the convention, but the committee's endorsement of Mr. Faso was still a blow to the Weld campaign. Mr. Weld had received the backing of the former chairman of the county committee, Bob Davis, who stepped down last month.</p>
        <p>In a statement released by the campaign, James Domagalski, the new Erie County chairman, praised Mr. Faso for having ''more firsthand knowledge of the most important issues to western New York and Erie County than any other candidate.''</p>
