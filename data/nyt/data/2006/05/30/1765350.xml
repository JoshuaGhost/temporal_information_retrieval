        <p>Gregor Mendel might never have figured out his well-known laws of inheritance if he had had to work with a perplexing strain of mice developed at the University of Nice in France.</p>
        <p>These brown laboratory mice have white feet and white-spotted tails because of a genetic defect engineered into a gene that controls pigmentation. But the defective gene behaves in a bizarrely non-Mendelian way, a group of researchers led by Minoo Rassoulzadegan report in the current issue of Nature.</p>
        <p>When a mouse with one normal and one defective version of the pigmentation gene is crossed with another such mouse, Mendel's laws predict there will be three types of offspring, one with two normal genes, one with two defective genes and one with genes of each kind.</p>
        <p>In this case, the defective gene dominates the normal version, so the mice with one defective copy should have white feet and tails, just like their parents, but the mice with two normal genes should have brown feet. (Having two defective genes is lethal, and mice of this kind died shortly after birth).</p>
        <p>The French researchers were very surprised to discover that almost all the surviving offspring had white extremities, including those with two normal genes. Crossing these white-footed, genetically normal mice with other normal mice, they found it took six generations for the trait to disappear.</p>
        <p>Though they have not nailed down the cause of this apparent exception to Mendel's laws, they believe the defective gene must produce some special kind of RNA, the chemical cousin of DNA that helps translate its genetic information into protein.</p>
        <p>The defective gene's RNA, they suggest, interferes with the RNA produced by the normal gene, which may help explain why the defective gene is dominant.</p>
        <p>In addition, the defective RNA may accumulate in sperm and continue to silence even the two normal genes possessed by the next generation of mice. Dr. Rassoulzadegan has detected RNA in the sperm of the mice. She reports that when this RNA is injected into the eggs of normal mice, the eggs develop into mice with the same white extremities.</p>
        <p>Thomas R. Cech, an RNA expert and president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, said it was hard to envisage how the defective gene's RNA avoided being quickly diluted to ineffectiveness between one generation of mice and the next. The defective RNA might get amplified each generation by a special enzyme that makes copies of RNA. But such an enzyme, though known to exist in roundworms, has not yet been detected in mice, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cech characterized the French mouse experiment as fascinating but not yet fully explicable. ''The whole things strikes me as a bit like Swiss cheese -- a lot of solid material holding the story together but with also a lot of holes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This is not the only known exception to Mendel's rules. Last year Robert Pruitt, a geneticist at Purdue University, discovered that mustard plants with two defective copies of a gene called hothead could nevertheless produce some normal offspring, as if the defective gene had somehow been repaired.</p>
        <p>But the repair would be possible only if the plant possessed an undamaged copy of the gene from which to restore the correct sequence of DNA units. Failing to find any DNA version of the correct genetic information, Dr. Pruitt suggested that the plant might carry a cryptic backup version of its DNA genome in the form of RNA, perhaps broken up into so many small pieces that it had escaped detection.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pruitt said the French observation did not involve any correction of a gene, like his finding, but it did suggest that RNA is passed from parent to offspring, an assumption made by his hypothesis, too.</p>
        <p>But in his view neither finding requires a rewriting of Mendel's laws, which correctly describe the conventional transmission of the hereditary information carried by DNA. The new results suggest there may exist ''an alternative pathway that involves the transmission of hereditary information via RNA,'' and that in special circumstances the RNA pathway can modify the information in the DNA pathway, Dr. Pruitt said.</p>
        <p>Anomalous findings are often dismissed in science, because researchers believe the experiment must have come out wrong or that it is not worth the effort of tracking down the cause. ''It happens all the time in science,'' Dr. Cech said. ''You come to a fork in the road, and you know you may waste time if you wander down it, but there's a small chance you'll discover something totally new that others have bypassed.''</p>
