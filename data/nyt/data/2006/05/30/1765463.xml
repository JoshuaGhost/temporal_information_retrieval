        <p>Morning commuters in Toronto, Canada's largest city, faced chaotic traffic jams when a strike by transit workers forced some 800,000 bus and subway users to seek alternative ways to work. News of the strike, set off by a plan to force maintenance workers to work overnight shifts, came late on Sunday, so many commuters were surprised to find locked subway stations yesterday morning. Picket lines were removed by midafternoon after the strike was ruled illegal by a labor relations board. Service was partly in place by the evening rush hour.</p>
