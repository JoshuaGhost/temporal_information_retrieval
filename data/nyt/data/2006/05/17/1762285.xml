        <p>Paul A. Camarda, a developer, wants to bring more stores to Putnam County.</p>
        <p>Putnam, which is still largely bucolic, has a population of only about 100,000, but Mr. Camarda is convinced that many county residents would love to be able to shop in a warehouse-type store like Costco, a consumer electronics store, a department store, a sporting goods store, a large bookseller like Barnes &amp; Noble, a Gap or a men's store.</p>

        <p>Paul A. Camarda, a developer, wants to bring more stores to Putnam County.</p>
        <p>Putnam, which is still largely bucolic, has a population of only about 100,000, but Mr. Camarda is convinced that many county residents would love to be able to shop in a warehouse-type store like Costco, a consumer electronics store, a department store, a sporting goods store, a large bookseller like Barnes &amp; Noble, a Gap or a men's store.</p>
        <p>''You can't buy a man's suit in Putnam now, as well as most of your electronics, like a computer or a television,'' he said last week. ''The paradox of this county is that we have the highest median income of any county in the state as well as one of the highest rates of home ownership, but there is no opportunity to shop.''</p>
        <p>As a longtime developer who used to focus mostly on single-family homes, Mr. Camarda, who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., says he is always looking for building voids that need to be filled.</p>
        <p>But in Putnam, immediately north of Westchester County, many residents have fought to preserve the county's vast expanses of green, while developers have also been stymied by the county's being within the 380-square-mile Croton watershed, where strict environmental limits are imposed on development.</p>
        <p>In the last five years, Mr. Camarda has proposed four projects that might entail sizable retail development, and while he is now actively pursuing only two of them, he is determined to bring the county more nationally known stores.</p>
        <p>Putnam is studded with small businesses, often family-owned, but many residents continue to shop outside the county, at places like the Danbury Fair Mall in Connecticut and the Jefferson Valley Mall in northern Westchester.</p>
        <p>Most of the nationally known retailers that have stores in the county are found at the Brewster Highlands shopping center in the town of Southeast, a 377,000-square-foot property that has a Home Depot, Kohl's, Linens 'n Things and Marshalls.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Robert J. Bondi, and some other elected officials want to encourage more retail development as a way for Putnam to counter its high property taxes, as well as to retain some of the money that is now leaving the county. Mr. Bondi says this outflow amounts to two-thirds of the disposable income generated by the county's residents.</p>
        <p>In late February, he introduced a program aimed at encouraging ''smart'' commercial retail development. It would give local municipalities a portion of any future sales tax revenue generated by new stores within their borders for use on projects like libraries, town halls or playing fields.</p>
        <p>Still, some towns in Putnam seem determined to oppose development. Last week, the board for the town of Putnam Valley, citing significant growth and development pressures, proposed a yearlong moratorium for residential and commercial construction so that the town could update both its master plan and its zoning regulations. A public hearing on the moratorium is scheduled for tonight.</p>
        <p>Kevin Bailey, the president of the Putnam County Economic Development Corporation, said his office was reviewing the moratorium and might ask the town board to reconsider a freeze on commercial (but not necessarily residential) development.</p>
        <p>''Any development is going to have thoughtful opposition to it, but we have to determine where residents' rights end and developers' rights begin,'' he said. ''Our school taxes are so high that if we don't get good clean commercial development, I think that half of the people who are living here now will move out within the next five years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Camarda said the retail projects that he would like to build would be either on major highways or on the perimeter of the county. In addition, he said, the projects were designed so that only a third of the land would be used for buildings and parking lots, while another third would be landscaped and the rest left untouched.</p>
        <p>Mr. Camarda's two retail developments that are active are the 406,000-square-foot Patterson Crossing, proposed for the intersection of Interstate 84 and Route 311, and the 183,000-square-foot Stateline Retail Center, which he hopes to build in Southeast.</p>
        <p>So far, citizens' groups like the Stop Patterson Crossing Committee have weighed in against both projects. As for the town of Southeast, its board recently proposed a zoning amendment that, if passed, would limit retail development within many parts of the nearly 35-square-mile town to stores that are less than 25,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Camarda clearly feels stung by the proposal. ''Most anchor stores are between 120,000 and 140,000 square feet in size, so this kind of limit is an effort to make the center an impossibility to build,'' he said last week. ''In the end, it would be just another strip center filled with pizzerias, delicatessens and nail salons.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Camarda said that the master plan for the town of Southeast did not currently have restrictions against big-box stores and that he might take legal action if he decided he had been treated unfairly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said the town of Southeast was considering restricting the size of new retail projects because it already had much of the commercial development within the county.</p>
        <p>Lately, some towns in Putnam, like Carmel, have weighed in with strong support for Mr. Camarda's efforts. Carmel, which is where Mr. Camarda's development company is based, approved a zoning amendment in late December that would allow the first large hotel in Putnam to be built on an 85-acre parcel of land that used to be zoned for light industrial use. Mr. Camarda hopes to use it for a large mixed-use development.</p>
        <p>The project, to be called Gateway Summit, would have a 150-room extended-stay Staybridge Suites hotel with about 12,000 square feet of conference and banquet space, as well as two restaurant chains, a convenience store and about 16,000 square feet of office space.</p>
        <p>Some local residents have criticized Mr. Camarda for not bringing a luxury hotel to Putnam County, but Robert Radomski, vice president for brand management at Staybridge Suites, said his company expected the hotel to attract strong interest from the many companies that have offices nearby, like Duracell, Pepsi and I.B.M.</p>
        <p>Some local residents, meanwhile, see another potential benefit: no longer will they have to travel to hotels in Fishkill, N.Y., or Danbury to hold large catered events like conferences and weddings.</p>
        <p>''I've been working for the longest time to get a hotel to come to the county, and about five years ago we had hoped to be able to get a Marriott,'' said Robert J. Ravallo, a councilman from Carmel. ''This hotel is not going to turn away users, especially on the weekends, and if it's successful, then it's going to bring in even more good retail projects.''</p>
