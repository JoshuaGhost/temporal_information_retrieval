        <p>Verizon, the country's second-largest phone company, said yesterday that it had not provided local phone records to the National Security Agency as part of efforts to compile a database of calling records to track terrorist activities.</p>
        <p>The announcement, a day after BellSouth issued a similar statement, came in response to a report in USA Today last Thursday that the three biggest Bell companies had handed over their customer calling records to the security agency, including data on local calls, without warrants.</p>
        <p>But the statement by Verizon left open the possibility that MCI, the long-distance carrier it bought in January, did turn over such records -- or that the unit, once absorbed into Verizon, had continued to do so. The company said Verizon had not provided customer records to the National Security Agency ''from the time of the 9/11 attacks until just four months ago.''</p>
        <p>MCI, Sprint and AT&amp;T carry the bulk of the country's long-distance and international calls.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for USA Today, Steven Anderson, said yesterday in response to the Verizon statement, ''We're confident in our coverage of the phone database story, but we won't summarily dismiss BellSouth's and Verizon's denials without taking a closer look.'' In addition to those companies, the article named AT&amp;T as having provided its calling data to the security agency.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T yesterday repeated earlier statements that it could not comment on national security issues but that it cooperates with law enforcement agencies only when they have a court order. AT&amp;T, the biggest Bell company, comprises the former SBC Communications and the AT&amp;T long-distance business, which it acquired last year, adopting its name.</p>
        <p>The other big Bell company, Qwest, has declined to comment, though its former chief executive, Joseph P. Nacchio, said through his lawyer last week that the company had rebuffed requests from the security agency to provide calling data in the aftermath of 9/11, citing a lack of legal process.</p>
        <p>The New York Times reported last December that the N.S.A. had gained access to some of the telecommunications industry's major arteries to trace vast amounts of phone and e-mail traffic and look for patterns of possible terrorist activity.</p>
        <p>USA Today, in its article last week, said the agency had amassed a database with tens of millions of call records in an effort to create a log of virtually every call made in the country. But the logistics of how the agency's phone-tracing operation works -- and whether the agency has direct access to the call records or relies on phone companies to provide their own records -- remains unclear.</p>
        <p>A senior government official, granted anonymity to speak for publication about the classified program, confirmed on Friday that the security agency had access to records of most telephone calls in the United States. The official said the call records were used for the limited purpose of identifying regular contacts of ''known bad guys.'' The official would not discuss the details of the program, including the identity of companies involved.</p>
        <p>In their hunt for terrorists, spy agencies could find it more efficient to focus on long-distance calls, rather than local ones; long-distance call records would include not just information about cross-country traffic but also about international communications, said Tony Rutkowski, vice president for regulatory affairs and standards for VeriSign, a company that offers security services for Internet and telephone operations.</p>
        <p>''The odds are that somebody calling a neighbor is not going to be a communication pattern of interest,'' he said. By ignoring those local call records, he said, government agents ''are obviously significantly diminishing the burden'' of combing through billions of calls to find patterns that could identify a threat.</p>
        <p>In 2004, more than 80 percent of the 463 billion domestic calls made in the United States were local, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Verizon said yesterday that ''phone companies do not even make records of local calls in most cases because the vast majority of customers are not billed per call for local calls.''</p>
        <p>While the Bell companies have operated long-distance divisions for years, they typically only connected calls in states where they offer local service. To connect calls outside their regions and overseas, they often handed off calls to long-distance carriers like MCI, Sprint and the old AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>Because federal law protects the privacy of phone records in the absence of warrants, companies providing such records could face legal action. Yesterday in Manhattan, a class-action suit filed against Verizon after the USA Today article appeared was expanded to include BellSouth and AT&amp;T as defendants, The Associated Press reported. It asked $200 billion in damages.</p>
