        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said on Thursday that it might cut Ford's debt rating deeper into junk status, citing concerns that the company's turnaround was falling short of expectations.</p>
        <p>S.&amp; P. put Ford and its finance unit on CreditWatch with negative implications, citing the ''deteriorating product mix and market share in North America and persistently high commodity costs generally.''</p>
        <p>S.&amp; P. said it would decide in about a month whether to lower Ford's rating, a move that would make borrowing money more costly for the company.</p>
        <p>The company is five months into a sweeping revamping effort called the Way Forward, which aims to close 14 plants and cut as many as 30,000 jobs in North America through 2012.</p>
        <p>Robert Schulz, an S.&amp; P. credit analyst who follows the auto industry, said that ''2006 looks like it's turning out to be perhaps a more difficult year than we would have thought.'' Ford posted a $1.2 billion loss for the first quarter, its largest in more than four years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schulz said he was particularly troubled by declining United States sales of Ford's full-size pickups and midsize sport utility vehicles -- traditionally its biggest money-makers -- as high gas prices cause consumers to seek vehicles with better fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Ford sold 14.5 percent fewer trucks in April; sales of its flagship S.U.V., the Explorer, fell 42 percent. S.&amp; P. first cut Ford's long-term debt rating to junk status a year ago and reduced it further, to BB-, in January. Ford's debt is rated two notches ahead of its rival General Motors, which S.&amp; P. also has placed on CreditWatch, largely because of concerns over a possible strike at the Delphi Corporation, G.M.'s largest supplier, which is operating in bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The January downgrade was meant to reflect S.&amp; P.'s assessment of the reorganization effort, Mr. Schulz said, but Ford's continued weak performance prompted another review.</p>
        <p>''Turning around North America is a multiyear process,'' Mr. Schulz acknowledged. But he pointed out that other automakers seem to be weathering high material and fuel prices better than Ford. Both G.M. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler were profitable in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>A Ford spokeswoman, Becky Sanch, said the company remained committed to its revamping plan.</p>
        <p>''We will continue to manage our costs, maintain leadership in the full-size pickup segment and introduce products that connect with our customers,'' Ms. Sanch said, noting that the S.&amp; P. report lists Ford's strong liquidity position as a positive.</p>
        <p>Ford ended the first quarter with $23.1 billion in cash in its automotive operations, but that was down from $25.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Shares of Ford rose 22 cents on Thursday, to close at $7.15.</p>
