        <p>Pope Benedict XVI arrived here on Thursday for a visit intended to maintain the strong ties with one of the few European countries where Roman Catholicism remains vibrant and to pay homage to his popular Polish predecessor, John Paul II.</p>
        <p>''Our journey together will be inspired by the motto: Stand firm in your faith,'' Benedict said after his plane touched down here at 11 a.m., with the wind whipping the Polish and Vatican flags. ''I mention this from the outset in order to stress that this is no mere sentimental journey, although it is certainly that, too, but rather a journey of faith.''</p>

        <p>Pope Benedict XVI arrived here on Thursday for a visit intended to maintain the strong ties with one of the few European countries where Roman Catholicism remains vibrant and to pay homage to his popular Polish predecessor, John Paul II.</p>
        <p>''Our journey together will be inspired by the motto: Stand firm in your faith,'' Benedict said after his plane touched down here at 11 a.m., with the wind whipping the Polish and Vatican flags. ''I mention this from the outset in order to stress that this is no mere sentimental journey, although it is certainly that, too, but rather a journey of faith.''</p>
        <p>He did not kiss the tarmac, as John Paul had, and Benedict's welcome was perhaps not as rapturous. Still, it would be hard to imagine any Western European nation giving so enthusiastic a greeting: Poles lined the streets for seven miles, from the airport to downtown, as Benedict passed in his popemobile. His every step was covered live on television. Newspapers even suspended their daily display of topless women.</p>
        <p>''I have to see him in person to fall in love with him,'' said Marianna Wasik, 75, who took a bus and a train from the town of Sierpl in the countryside for the visit.</p>
        <p>But in this part of Europe, memory plays an unavoidable part, and that, too, shaped the itinerary for this four-day trip. It will include visits to Auschwitz and Birkenau, Nazi death camps where millions of Jews died in World War II.</p>
        <p>While John Paul visited the site in 1979, this visit will be different and perhaps more dramatic. Benedict, born Joseph Ratzinger in Germany, was inducted into the Hitler Youth and the German Army (though he deserted and spent time in a camp for prisoners of war).</p>
        <p>Relations between Poland and Germany are not yet whole, and the subject is delicate enough that Benedict will speak publicly almost entirely in Italian, rather than in his native German, Vatican officials said. ''Remembering all of the dead, also to learn how man can truly lose his dignity in trampling on others, we hope that from this will be born a new sense of humanism and humanity,'' the pope told reporters on his plane when asked how he felt about visiting the death camps.</p>
        <p>He added, however, that he was visiting not primarily as a German.</p>
        <p>''I am above all a Catholic,'' he said. ''I would say that this is the most important part that we must always learn, that we are Catholic.''</p>
        <p>In remarks in St. John's Cathedral here, the pope also appeared to wade into a recent crisis for the Polish church: accusations that several priests, one among the most prominent here, had been Communist informers for years.</p>
        <p>He told reporters, ''I am making this voyage in the footsteps of this great pope,'' John Paul II. John Paul, who died in April 2005, is remembered here not only as a national hero but also as a force that helped end half a century of Communism. Benedict is visiting several sites central to the life of his predecessor, including Krakow, where John Paul was archbishop, and Wadowice, his hometown.</p>
        <p>John Paul traveled here eight times in his 26 years as pope, the last time in August 2002.</p>
        <p>The visit to Poland is Benedict's second trip outside of Italy in a little more than 13 months as pope. His first, last summer, was to his native Germany. Benedict, who recently turned 79 and is far more reserved than his predecessor, made it clear when he was elected that he would travel and speak publicly less than John Paul did. At this point in John Paul's pontificate, he had made four trips, visiting seven countries, including Poland, the United States, Mexico and Turkey.</p>
        <p>Benedict, who served for more than two decades as John Paul's defender of the faith, often mentions him in speeches and has frequently said that he sees his role as building on his predecessor's legacy. But the trip also underscores one of Benedict's own longtime concerns: the increasing secularization of Europe.</p>
        <p>Poland, a large and dynamic nation with nearly 40 million people, is an exception -- an almost entirely Catholic country where people still attend Mass more frequently than those in most other European nations. It thus represents something of a religious counterweight of faith on the Continent -- a status that Benedict is urging Poles not to give up as their country grows richer and as their memory of communism, and the church's opposition to it, fades.</p>
        <p>''In the face of the temptations of relativism or the permissive society, there is absolutely no need for the priest to know all the latest, changing currents of thought,'' he told Polish priests on Thursday in the cathedral. ''What the faithful expect from him is that he be a witness to the eternal wisdom contained in the revealed word.''</p>
        <p>In remarks that seemed to address the issue of informers among priests in the Communist era, he noted that John Paul often called on Christians ''to do penance'' for sins in the church's history, but appeared to caution against any quick judgment against the accused priests or the church as a whole.</p>
        <p>''We must guard against the arrogant claim of setting ourselves up to judge earlier generations, who lived in different times and different circumstances,'' he said at the cathedral. ''Humble sincerity is needed in order not to deny the sins of the past, and at the same time not to indulge in false accusations in the absence of real evidence.''</p>
