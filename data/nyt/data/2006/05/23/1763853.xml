        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain's comments about the New School student protests were just as canned as his commencement speech: ''I feel sorry for people living in a dull world where they can't listen to the views of others.''</p>
        <p>Because he had delivered the exact same words twice before, these students had not only heard his comments, but they had also clearly listened to them.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the nimble thinker in this ordeal turned out to be Jean Sara Rohe, a student speaker, who veered from her planned remarks to address the speech's content more specifically.</p>
        <p>If this was Mr. McCain's attempt to ''bolster his conservative credentials,'' his inability to deviate from his script did provide an apt counterpoint to Ms. Rohe's speech, which revealed the sort of agile, analytic and ''brave'' thinking we should expect from a graduate of a progressive university.</p>
