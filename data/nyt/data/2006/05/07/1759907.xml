        <p>Since moving to Los Angeles six years ago, Melissa Sagemiller, 31, has scored a string of roles. In a few months she'll be a co-star in the Showtime series ''Sleeper Cell,'' which was a Golden Globe nominee this year, and is to appear in two movies: ''The Guardian,'' a drama with Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher, and the quirky comedy ''Mr. Woodcock,'' with Susan Sarandon and Billy Bob Thornton. Her wardrobe has similar range.</p>
        <p>''My style is modern, classic, eclectic and romantic,'' she said over the phone from Dallas, where she was visiting during a break in shooting, and browsing in the Tory Burch boutique. ''I like simple things with an edge, or a color that pops,'' she said. ''My favorite outfit of the moment is skinny jeans, a cream and navy blue striped cashmere sweater and red Ferragamo pumps.''</p>

        <p>Here, Ms. Sagemiller, a native of Washington, combines a blouse by How and Wen with a vest by Twelfth Street by Cynthia Vincent, BCBG cropped pants and vintage Charles Jourdan boots.</p>
        <p>''It took me awhile to adjust to the style in L.A.,'' she said. ''You can mix and match, as long as you do it with flair. The East Coast is more label-oriented. Everyone in New York carries this bag or that bag.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Los Angeles is mellow. You can go out at night in a dress, ballet flats and a little wrap.''</p>
