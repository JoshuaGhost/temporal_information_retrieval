        <p>It was not a typical job workshop.</p>
        <p>''When's a good time to show this face?'' asked Gyasi Headen, a manager of training at Strive, a nonprofit job training and placement organization on East 123rd Street in Manhattan. He slumped in his chair, rested his head on the palm of his extended arm, and glared at the 20 or so mostly black male job seekers who gathered on a recent Monday, the first day of a four-week job-readiness training program.</p>

        <p>It was not a typical job workshop.</p>
        <p>''When's a good time to show this face?'' asked Gyasi Headen, a manager of training at Strive, a nonprofit job training and placement organization on East 123rd Street in Manhattan. He slumped in his chair, rested his head on the palm of his extended arm, and glared at the 20 or so mostly black male job seekers who gathered on a recent Monday, the first day of a four-week job-readiness training program.</p>
        <p>''At 12 o'clock at night, you're in the 'hood and they're going to try to get you,'' one man answered.</p>
        <p>Another man said, ''It's to keep people at bay.''</p>
        <p>James Moody, 30, of Brooklyn, offered: ''It's when you want to intimidate somebody.''</p>
        <p>The men were talking about ''game face,'' slang for the menacing expression worn by many African-American and Hispanic men who live in inner cities. But many men who wear their game faces on the streets also wear them on interviews and at work, preventing them from getting and keeping jobs, said Mr. Headen, who is black.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody acknowledged, ''I got one of those faces -- it's a byproduct of my environment.'' By way of explanation, he said that 12 years in prison, which began when he was a teenager, had taken a toll.</p>
        <p>''But I'm trying to square up,'' he said. ''That's why I'm sitting here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Headen stressed the importance of leaving the game face behind at interviews. Employers, he explained to the group, are often willing to provide training for entry-level employees who have good attitudes and are willing to learn.</p>
        <p>''You only have 30 seconds to make a first impression, and the next half-hour to really win a person over,'' Mr. Headen said. ''Rob me with your smile, please. You know, 'He was a nice gentleman and he robbed me.' '' The class members -- many of them, like Mr. Headen, former offenders -- laughed.</p>
        <p>Since it started more than 20 years ago in the East Harlem projects, Strive has been known for taking a nontraditional approach to job preparation for the hard-to-employ. Many participants are high school dropouts, have criminal records or are substance abusers.</p>
        <p>''Their anger can be totally justified,'' said Lizzette Dunn-Barcelona, executive director of Strive's New York office. ''But if you want to get a job, you can't look angry.''</p>
        <p>The new workshop, she said, is in keeping with Strive's overall philosophy. ''Our mandate is that we ensure that we give them every single tool to be successful.''</p>
        <p>Strive mainly serves people in the New York City boroughs, but is open to anyone. With a few exceptions -- like those who are actively using drugs -- ''we really don't turn anyone away,'' Ms. Dunn-Barcelona said.</p>
        <p>Strive's core program -- the game face workshop is a part of that -- has been described as attitude-change boot camp.</p>
        <p>Participants, who pay no fees for the program, are fined for breaking rules, like using slang words (50 cents) or not wearing name tags ($1.50). Classes run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each weekday, and those who miss more than two sessions have to redo the entire four weeks. And being late, even by a minute, ''will be grounds for termination'' from the program, the manual states.</p>
        <p>''Sugarcoating it really doesn't help them,'' Mr. Headen said in an interview. ''We don't have time; it has to be straightforward; it has to come fast. They have four weeks to give up 18 to 40 years of bad habits.''</p>
        <p>Kendan Luther, 22, of the Bronx, who was hired by Chelsea Mini-Storage as an elevator operator last year after attending Strive's program, participated in one of the first game face workshops. He said he would often display his game face on interviews -- out of nervousness more than any other reason -- but was not aware of it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Headen said the game face workshop, the most recent set of exercises added to the core program, was ''an opportunity to address a taboo.''</p>
        <p>''If you look at American culture, we've been taught not to discuss people's looks'' like their attractiveness or weight, he said, ''but we judge people based on looks.''</p>
        <p>But it is not all tough love. Some exercises introduced over the years are intended to lift confidence, like the ''praise poem,'' which requires participants to write about their positive qualities.</p>
        <p>''I see drive and I see fire,'' said Stephen Mallon, general manager of Chelsea Mini-Storage in Manhattan, who has hired some 60 Strive graduates over the last 12 years. He said they were often more focused than other prospective employees.</p>
        <p>Gail Tessler and Norma Menkin, co-presidents of Gainor Staffing in Manhattan, who have worked with Strive for a decade, said they believed that the organization's strong track record was a result of the candidates' preparedness and the careful matching of candidates to jobs. Strive graduates are often easier to place than candidates from similar organizations, they said.</p>
        <p>Last year, Strive's New York office placed close to 70 percent of its graduates in jobs, and an average of 70 percent of those remained employed after a year, Ms. Dunn-Barcelona said.</p>
        <p>Employment has generally increased among black men in the last two years in New York City, but it still trails that of white men by nearly 13 percentage points, said Mark Levitan, senior labor market policy analyst at the Community Service Society in New York and author of a recently released report on employment in the city. ''What the data show very clearly is that there is an ongoing racial disparity in employment,'' Mr. Levitan said.</p>
        <p>Young black men are particularly hard hit, said Ronald B. Mincy, a professor of social policy and social work practice at the Columbia University School of Social Work and editor of ''Black Males Left Behind'' (Urban Institute Press, 2006).</p>
        <p>His book is one of several recent studies showing that the plight of young black men with limited education has worsened in recent years, despite periods of economic growth and welfare overhaul that have benefited black women and other groups.</p>
        <p>Young black men have unique needs that have not been widely addressed, but programs like Strive, which stress attitude assessment with respect to work, have been particularly successful, Professor Mincy said.</p>
        <p>''Strive has found a way to communicate with young black men,'' he said. ''They understand how to package it in a way the population they serve can understand and embrace.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody, the Strive participant, agrees. ''Change is a beautiful thing,'' he said. ''I love waking up at 6:30 a.m.''</p>
        <p>One of his favorite things about Strive is the discipline it instills, he said in an interview. Mr. Moody, who is studying for his G.E.D. exam, recently got a job at Ellis Island in the food service area, and hopes one day to work counseling teenagers to avoid the mistakes he made at their age. ''You're looking at a man on the right path,'' he said. ''My life is beautiful. I love it out here.''</p>
