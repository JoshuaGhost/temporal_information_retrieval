        <p>The Bush administration on Monday dispatched Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, to Nigeria, where he plans to plunge directly into the negotiations over a treaty to end the carnage in the Darfur region of Sudan, which stalled again on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mediators extended the talks for 48 hours after the Sudanese government and Darfur rebel groups, meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, failed to reach full agreement by the deadline on Sunday night. Then on Monday morning, Vice President Ali Osman Taha of Sudan, the senior representative of his government at the talks, abruptly left Abuja and returned to Sudan's capital, Khartoum, complaining that the rebel leaders had been intransigent, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Sudanese government offered on Sunday to accept the terms of the proposed agreement, but two of the three principal Darfur rebel groups refused. On Monday, the third and most important rebel group also expressed strong reservations.</p>
        <p>Among the provisions of the proposed agreement are several that call on the rebels and government militias to disarm in a carefully choreographed sequence. But each side holds deep distrust for the other.</p>
        <p>Sudanese officials said Monday that if the peace talks failed, the blame would fall squarely on the rebels, for refusing what the government claims is a fair deal. But the State Department urged Mr. Taha to return to Abuja, saying in a statement that the negotiations had come ''down to a few difficult issues.''</p>
        <p>Abduljabbar Dosa, chief negotiator of the largest and most important rebel faction of the Sudanese Liberation Movement, reacted angrily to Mr. Taha's decision to leave.</p>
        <p>''The departure of Ali Osman Taha at this time, it gives a wrong sign,'' Mr. Dosa said.</p>
        <p>Frustrated by the state of affairs, Salim Ahmed Salim, the lead mediator, called Mr. Zoellick on Monday morning and asked him to come to Abuja immediately. Mr. Zoellick has been deeply engaged in the Darfur issue since he took office last year, and knows nearly everyone involved in the talks. He agreed and left Monday afternoon and will arrive in Abuja Tuesday morning, in time to play a role in the final day of negotiations.</p>
        <p>In Abuja, negotiators for the rebel movements sounded defiant and upbeat, firmly rejecting the plan as presented yet leaving open the possibility of a deal.</p>
        <p>Ahmed Tugod Lissan, chief negotiator for one of the rebel groups, the Justice and Equality Movement, said of the agreement: ''It left out critical areas as far as power sharing and the status of Darfur region. But I am optimistic something could be achieved within the next 24 hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dosa called the deal unacceptable because it did not include compensation for those driven off their land.</p>
        <p>In Khartoum, Jamal Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Sudanese government, said: ''We have been committed to the deadline on the 30th of April. But now the problem is that the rebel movements are not accepting to sit and sign.''</p>
        <p>A senior Sudanese diplomat who has been following the talks closely said the government might have erred in so quickly accepting the deal, because it gave the impression that it was far more favorable to the government than to the rebels.</p>
        <p>''It complicated the matter further, because the rebels saw the quick acceptance as a trick for them,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak openly on the matter.</p>
        <p>More than 200,000 people have died and two million more have been driven from their homes since the conflict began in February 2003. The Abuja peace talks have limped along for almost two years.</p>
        <p>But in early April, the African Union, with the support of the United Nations, said the talks would end if no agreement was reached by April 30. As a result, both the government and Darfur rebel groups sent senior representatives to Abuja last week.</p>
        <p>Part of the difficulty of persuading the rebels to accept the deal, said John Prendergast, a former senior Africa specialist for the United States government, is that the rebels are afraid of giving away ''the one card they have, which is military pressure, before being certain of movement implementing the peace deal.''</p>
