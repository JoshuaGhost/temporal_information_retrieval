        <p>Last Words From Johnny Cash</p>
        <p>The last song written by Johnny Cash, right, will be included in an album he recorded in the months before his death at 71 in 2003. The new album, ''American V: A Hundred Highways,'' is to be released on July 4 on the American Recordings label, distributed by Lost Highway. Rick Rubin, the producer, said in a press release: ''These songs are Johnny's final statement. They are the truest reflection of the music that was central to his life at the time. This is the music that Johnny wanted us to hear.'' Besides ''Like the 309,'' Cash's final song, and another of his compositions, ''I Came to Believe,'' the eclectic album, with a plea to God, a ballad and a traditional spiritual, includes songs by Hank Williams, Rod McKuen and Bruce Springsteen.</p>
        <p>MTV Germany Rethinks 'Popetown'</p>
        <p>MTV Germany, reacting to an outcry from Roman Catholic organizations and leading politicians in the predominantly Catholic state of Bavaria, has revised its plans to broadcast the satirical cartoon series ''Popetown,'' which mocks the church. Instead of broadcasting the 10 episodes of the series beginning tomorrow, MTV Germany has decided to show only one, to be followed by a televised discussion, Reuters reported. Based on reaction to the initial broadcast, MTV said, it will decide whether to broadcast the rest of the series. Last week an MTV newspaper advertisement for ''Popetown,'' showing Jesus descending from his cross to watch television and bearing the caption, ''Have a laugh instead of hanging around,'' prompted a fresh wave of protests, which began last month. At that time MTV said it had no plans to alter its schedule. The series was originally produced for the BBC, but it decided in 2004 that ''Popetown'' was too controversial to screen. It is available on DVD.</p>
        <p>Verdict Expected In Munch Theft</p>
        <p>A verdict is expected today in a Norwegian court where six men stand accused of stealing the Edvard Munch masterwork ''The Scream,'' right, and another of his paintings, ''Madonna,'' in a brazen daylight armed robbery at the Munch Museum in Oslo in 2004, Agence France-Presse reported. The six men, who have pleaded not guilty, face sentences as long as 11 years, as well as a claim of $114 million in damages. Prosecutors have theorized that the theft was carried out on orders of a gang responsible for an armed robbery a few months earlier in which a policeman was killed. ''The theft of 'The Scream' was probably committed to distract the attention of the investigators,'' Terje Nyboe, a state prosecutor, said. ''We are not working on any other theory.'' The paintings remain missing.</p>
        <p>Avery Fisher Grant Winners Named</p>
        <p>Avery Fisher Career Grants of $15,000 each are to be awarded today to the cellist Efe Baltacigil, below, the violinist Erin Keefe, the hornist Jennifer Montone, the violist Richard O'Neill and the Pacific Quartet. The grants from the Avery Fisher Artist Program, established by Avery Fisher in a gift to Lincoln Center in 1974, are intended to give professional assistance and recognition to talented instrumentalists and chamber ensembles. Since the grants were first made in 1976, 102, including this year's, have been made. All the recipients are working musicians. Previous recipients include Leila Josefowicz, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Gil Shaham and David Shifrin.</p>
