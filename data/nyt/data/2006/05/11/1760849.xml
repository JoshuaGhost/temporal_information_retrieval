        <p>Howard Dean was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee on an unusual promise: To send millions of dollars in contributions to build up state Democratic parties, even in states that vote solidly Republican.</p>
        <p>Fifteen months after taking office, Mr. Dean has done precisely that. But the policy that has defined his tenure -- while delighting state Democratic chairmen -- has embroiled him in a battle with the two Congressional Democrats leading the effort to retake Congress this fall.</p>
        <p>In a heated meeting last week, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, challenged Mr. Dean on his 50-state program, saying it was undercutting Democratic hopes of taking back the House and the Senate, Democrats said. They warned that Mr. Dean was squandering an opportunity by sending money to parties in states that are a long way from becoming Democratic.</p>
        <p>Democrats informed about the meeting described it as contentious and said Mr. Emanuel left abruptly when Mr. Dean declined to agree. Mr. Emanuel, in an interview, said he had left the meeting to cast a vote in Congress. He described their differences as a ''fundamental difference about short-term versus long-term objectives -- it is not hostile.''</p>
        <p>But in an interview, he said that he and Mr. Schumer, in their meeting with Mr. Dean, had drawn comparisons between what he was doing and the actions of his counterpart, Ken Mehlman, the leader of the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>''We have an historic opportunity here,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''We need you on the field just like the R.N.C. is going to be on the field. If Ken Mehlman takes a powder on this election, great. But if not, you've got to be there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean's program of sending money to state parties reflects his criticism of party leaders for having only focused on a handful of states. One politically practical result is that he has strong support among many state chairmen.</p>
        <p>''The governor feels very strongly that the Democratic Party needs infrastructure to make us competitive in every state,'' said his spokesman, Stacie Paxton.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Schumer, Phil Singer, declined comment other than to say: ''Senator Schumer believes that whatever difference exists will be worked out in an amiable and productive fashion.''</p>
