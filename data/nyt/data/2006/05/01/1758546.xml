        <p>Pearl Jam  ''Pearl Jam'' (J Records)</p>
        <p>There's something obstinate and honorable about Pearl Jam. After selling millions of albums in the 1990's, Pearl Jam has long since sloughed off the parts of its music that were most palatable to radio stations -- grunge power chords, choruses full of anthemic angst -- and left them in the hands of MTV-friendly bands that already sound like 1990's nostalgia acts. ''Once dissolved we are free to grow,'' Eddie Vedder sings in ''Severed Hand,'' a grungy garage-rock song on the band's first studio album since 2002, ''Pearl Jam.''</p>

        <p>Pearl Jam  ''Pearl Jam'' (J Records)</p>
        <p>There's something obstinate and honorable about Pearl Jam. After selling millions of albums in the 1990's, Pearl Jam has long since sloughed off the parts of its music that were most palatable to radio stations -- grunge power chords, choruses full of anthemic angst -- and left them in the hands of MTV-friendly bands that already sound like 1990's nostalgia acts. ''Once dissolved we are free to grow,'' Eddie Vedder sings in ''Severed Hand,'' a grungy garage-rock song on the band's first studio album since 2002, ''Pearl Jam.''</p>
        <p>Instead of chasing pop-chart success, Pearl Jam now hones the two-guitar grappling of Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, lets Mr. Vedder stay as tortured, self-righteous or inscrutable as he wishes, makes studio albums on its own timetable and tours regularly to arena crowds. Take them or leave them, like a latter-day Grateful Dead, they're not going out of their way to ingratiate themselves and they're not going away.</p>
        <p>''Pearl Jam'' comes on like a fireball. Most of the songs -- like ''World Wide Suicide,'' a bitter, furious tirade about a soldier's death and the prospect of endless war -- are fast and noisy, although the album pauses now and then for songs like ''Parachutes,'' which suggests a John Lennon ballad with some skipped and added beats.</p>
        <p>Pearl Jam is now grounded as much in 1960's garage-rock and the psychedelic turbulence of Jefferson Airplane as in metal or punk. Mr. Vedder's lyrics have death, war, morality and faith very much on their mind -- with a digression on surfing in ''Big Wave'' -- and he's not offering many answers. But arguments with himself are incarnated in the way the guitars squabble, the meter turns irregular and the song structures take off on tangents.</p>
        <p>Now as ever, Pearl Jam takes itself seriously. But it delivers that seriousness not with the sodden self-importance of rock superstardom, but with the craft and hunger of a band still proving itself on the spot.</p>
