        <p>ON Monday night, the James Beard Foundation will hand out its 16th annual awards with the usual pomp: a black-tie ceremony, then a standing-room-only scrum for food at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square.</p>
        <p>The theme of this year's gala is the culinary heritage of New Orleans, a parallel for a group that is recovering from its own storm: last year its longtime head went to jail for stealing from the foundation, and its entire board of trustees resigned.</p>
        <p>The foundation says it completed the first stage in its recovery last month, when it named Susan Ungaro, former editor in chief of Family Circle magazine, its president, with a mandate to rethink the group's mission of culinary education and preservation.</p>
        <p>''There is no way we are going to be just a dining society in the future,'' said Woodrow W. Campbell Jr., a lawyer at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton and a member of the new Beard board, referring to the group's past reputation as an expensive showplace for chefs aspiring to reach New York's cultural elite.</p>
        <p>Some changes -- both practical and symbolic -- are already evident. The process of how chefs are chosen to cook at the Beard townhouse in Greenwich Village, once shrouded in mystery, has been spelled out, including the fact that chefs are expected to shoulder most of the expense. The board, formerly composed of obscure donors and friends of Beard, now includes not only chefs -- Emily Luchetti, Norman Van Aken, Patrick O'Connell and Robert Del Grande -- but also public figures like the former prosecutor Linda Fairstein and Jennifer Howse, president of the March of Dimes.</p>
        <p>Last week, Dorothy Cann Hamilton, chairwoman of the board, said a new goal of the foundation is to be a food research institute, ''a resource for government and industry.''</p>
        <p>''Why shouldn't we have our own Davos, where Jean-Georges Vongerichten and the secretary of agriculture sit down with the C.E.O. of Sysco?'' she said.</p>
        <p>Beard's grand plans throw light on the increasingly serious -- and competitive -- world of food enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>It all started marginally enough in the 1970's, with a few like-minded people huddling around, say, a coq au vin and an old bottle of French Burgundy. From these spindly roots grew the American food appreciation movement, and organizations grew up to service it, among them large-scale cooking schools and culinary charities like the Institute for Culinary Education, the American Institute of Wine and Food, the International Association of Culinary Professionals and the James Beard Foundation.</p>
        <p>The early incarnations grew quickly and chaotically, run by friends on shoestring budgets. ''It was a mom-and-pop operation,'' said Arlyn Blake, who recently left the staff of the Beard foundation after more than a decade. ''Now it has to be a business.''</p>
        <p>That's because American food lovers have become more willing to back up their interest with serious money, and the organizations are scrambling for bigger chunks of it. The A.I.W.F. has had success with upscale European cruises run by descendants of Auguste Escoffier. The Beard foundation has developed an affiliation with New York University that is allowing it to co-sponsor a conference on the Mediterranean diet next month at the university's spectacular villa in Florence, La Pietra.</p>
        <p>Copia: The American Center for Food, Wine and the Arts in the Napa Valley is staging Taste3, an ambitious meeting of food scientists, historians, chefs, winemakers and industry executives, sponsored by the Robert Mondavi Winery, in July. For $2,350 a person, not including accommodations, attendees can immerse themselves in two days of ''nimble minds, eclectic palates and provocative ideas,'' with those attending including the Pilobolus Dance Company and Hiroshi Tanaka, a Japanese scientist who has developed a way of electrolyzing wine so that it ages in seconds.</p>
        <p>Copia, the newest group, is a high-minded nonprofit founded with $20 million from Robert Mondavi and devoted to wine, food and the arts. Its estate in Napa, Calif., includes 12 acres of buildings, organic gardens, restaurants and tasting rooms.</p>
        <p>The year 2005 was a rocky one for many of the organizations. After the Beard financial scandal, some awards judges resigned and the whole program distanced itself from the foundation. Leonard F. Pickell Jr., the former president, went to an upstate prison, where he remains hospitalized with a septic foot wound complicated by diabetes, according to his brother, Derek Pickell. His release is expected in June.</p>
        <p>Also last year, Copia's director stepped down, and the board flirted with raising Copia's profile through a proposed merger with the A.I.W.F., which has been facing a decline in income and membership. But negotiations broke down and the institute moved its headquarters to New York City.</p>
        <p>Copia struggled financially after opening in 2001, and a new president, Arthur Jacobus, was brought in last year to ''change the model,'' which he says was quiet, museum-like and not much fun for the casual visitor. ''Reducing the ticket price from $12.50 to $5 made a big difference,'' he said. Bigger ideas for Copia include a food-and-wine-themed ''village.''</p>
        <p>The deep pockets of American food lovers have attracted the notice of institutions like New York University, which has loaned its imprimatur to various Beard foundation projects. ''The university gets to raise its public profile,'' said Lisa Sasson, a clinical assistant professor of nutrition at N.Y.U. and a planner of the Florence event. ''And the attendees have access to the top academic work in the subject.'' In June 2004, the University of California at Davis broke ground for a wine and food study center with seed money -- $25 million -- coming from Robert Mondavi and his wife, Margrit.</p>
        <p>The interest goes both ways: cooking schools are gaining a new kind of academic credibility. The French Culinary Institute in Manhattan, which will be transformed into the International Culinary Center in October after a major expansion, boasts deans of pastry arts and Italian studies, among others. At the Artisanal Premium Cheese Center in Manhattan, Max McCalman holds the grand title dean of curriculum. ''The kind of people who will spend 12 hours in a cheese master class appreciate being treated like serious students'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCalman is also involved in the increasingly crowded world of culinary awards, as a judge for the new Gallo Family Gold Medal awards for artisanal producers. Blending the serious purpose of SlowFood and the taste criteria of a Pillsbury Bake-Off, the first awards were bestowed last month in categories including Outstanding Condiment and Outstanding Dairy. This fall, Copia will expand its wine awards programs to include food, although without attaching ''chef'' or ''restaurant'' or even ''food'' to the categories.</p>
        <p>''It might be a farmer, or an iconic product, or a people's choice award,'' said Linda Carucci, Copia's culinary director. ''It might be the person who invented bagged salad, or another marketing innovation that changed Americans' relationship to food. What it won't be is a duplication of any other awards program.'' This year, Beard honors will be awarded in 70 categories.</p>
        <p>''To continue to be meaningful, awards have to be somewhat restrictive'' Mr. McCalman said. ''But there's no question that they benefit the industry, both in morale and on the margins.''</p>
        <p>Susan Ungaro said chefs have never had more reason for high morale. ''Not only are chefs celebrities now, but they are the most likable ones we have,'' she said. ''Compared to the Jens and J. Lo's of the world, celebrity chefs are engaged with important things: families, health, agriculture.''</p>
        <p>They are also increasingly perceived as artists. This week, producers are wrapping the first season of ''Chef's Story,'' a program in the style of ''Inside the Actors Studio'' that brings Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Thomas Keller and 24 other American chefs out from behind the stove to talk solemnly about their work.</p>
        <p>Their interviewer -- surprise -- is Dorothy Cann Hamilton, who, as founder of the French Culinary Institute, the Beard chairwoman, and past president of the A.I.W.F., has become ubiquitous at the top of the culinary world. ''I am very careful to keep my roles separate,'' she said. ''I am not interested in being accused of profiteering.'' Ms. Hamilton's career, which began with a 20-year stint as president of Apex Technical School, is a road map of the progress of American professional cooking as it has risen to a highly refined, expressive profession.</p>
        <p>''It's wonderful, what has happened to the industry,'' said Andrew Carmellini, last year's winner of the Beard for best chef in New York. ''But sometimes I miss the old days of the Beard awards, with Drew Nieporent doing the cancan up on the stage.''</p>
