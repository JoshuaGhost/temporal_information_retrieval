        <p>CHIEF executives everywhere probably breathed a sigh of relief last week when the Enron verdicts came in. With Kenneth L. Lay, the company's former chairman, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, its former chief executive, found guilty of fraud and other crimes, maybe now we can all move past this corporation-run-amok stuff.Enron, after all, was an anomaly, right?</p>
        <p>Sorry, pals. Other news from last week showed that the Enron verdicts were, at best, the end of the beginning of this dispiriting corporate crime wave. They were certainly not the beginning of its end.</p>
        <p>Last week, for example, investors learned that a throng of former executives at Fannie Mae, the mortgage-financing giant, had cooked the company's books to generate munificent bonuses for themselves. And while this was going on, Fannie's board was AWOL.</p>
        <p>While Fannie Mae has not been charged with criminal wrongdoing, the 350-page report issued by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, was a gripping and definitive account of the company's $10.6 billion accounting debacle.. The report confirmed that Fannie Mae is, as its spinmeisters say, in ''the American Dream business''-- for its executives, that is.</p>
        <p>Josh Rosner, an analyst at Graham Fisher &amp; Company, an independent financial research firm in New York, has followed Fannie Mae for years. The report's revelations were disgraceful on several counts, he said.</p>
        <p>First was the disturbing breadth of Fannie Mae's dubious management and accounting practices. ''At Enron, it was really three or four individuals who were intimately involved in the plan and the process and the intent to manipulate,'' he said. ''The number of people who are identified as being problematic here is pretty staggering.''</p>
        <p>More than a dozen executives appear in the report, and Fannie Mae's board also comes in for criticism. ''Every bit of this report says the board was asleep at the switch,'' Mr. Rosner said.</p>
        <p>For example, the Ofheo report noted that the board was advised in 1999 that the company had adjusted its financial statements to burnish its 1998 results.</p>
        <p>Notes made by J. Timothy Howard, Fannie Mae's chief financial officer, for a January 1999 board meeting stated the following: ''Taking these adjustments now will mean that we can report higher levels of net interest income and guaranty fees over the next year or two. That's one reason we made them.''</p>
        <p>Ofheo found that the adjustments were meant to mislead investors. Perhaps the most shocking tidbit in the Ofheo report was its disclosure that Fannie Mae entered into insurance contracts to help the company keep its losses artificially low. The arrangements had no economic value and did not involve any transfer of risk, as insurance typically does. Instead, the contracts were designed so that they produced a greater benefit to the company if more of its mortgages went into foreclosure.</p>
        <p>''Fannie Mae was essentially betting against the American dream,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''It is truly disgusting that you had a company entering into a sham transaction that had little economic benefit but that only paid off if more people had their homes foreclosed.''</p>
        <p>One of the central players in the manipulation at Fannie Mae, according to the Ofheo report, was Franklin D. Raines, its chief executive from 1999 to 2004. The report said that he not only created an ''unethical and arrogant culture'' at the top of the company, but that more than half of the $90 million in compensation he hauled in between 1998 and 2003 was generated by accounting gimmicks that allowed him to meet bonus targets artificially.</p>
        <p>Robert Bennett, a lawyer representing Mr. Raines, said in a statement last week that the former chairman ''never authorized, encouraged, or was aware of violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) at Fannie Mae for the purpose of smoothing earnings, reaching bonus targets, or for any other improper reason.'' He noted that Mr. Raines had promised that he would hold himself accountable ''if it was determined that Fannie Mae misapplied accounting rules.''</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Bennett's statement, Mr. Raines fulfilled that pledge by ''retiring early'' from Fannie Mae. Volunteering to give back portions of his jury-rigged bonuses was not mentioned as another way to keep his promise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosner said that he found the $400 million fine that Ofheo and the Securities and Exchange Commission leveled against Fannie Mae to settle the company's accounting shenanigans to be disturbingly low. He described the fine as a mere ''toll.''</p>
        <p>''For a $10.6 billion minimum restatement, for them to have to pay $400 million, you may as well tell people 'you can lie and here's the dollar figure per lie,' '' Mr. Rosner said.</p>
        <p>After the report came out, Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's chief executive said: ''We are glad to resolve these matters. We have all learned some powerful lessons here about getting things right and about hubris and humility. We are a much different company than before. But we also recognize that we have a long road ahead of us.''</p>
        <p>TWO days later, the Enron verdicts were announced. That was also when Thomas J. Lehner, director of public policy for the Business Roundtable, was testifying on Capitol Hill in defense of current practices in executive compensation. Mr. Lehner reiterated the Business Roundtable's belief that executive pay at most American companies is justified and expressed opposition to legislation that would allow shareholders to approve compensation plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehner's testimony brought back memories from November 2003, when the Business Roundtable announced what it called an important initiative on executive pay. Mr. Raines, who was chairman of the roundtable's Corporate Governance Task Force, said at that time: ''Executive compensation should reward success and not reward failure.''</p>
        <p>Do as I say, not as I do?</p>
        <p>Yes, the long and sorry story of Enron is nearing a close. Unfortunately, questionable corporate practices continue apace. There is obviously much work to be done -- by prosecutors and shareholders -- before we can be sure that other Enrons will not happen.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors know what trails to follow. Shareholders, less accustomed to taking such an active role, may not be as certain.</p>
        <p>They should begin by holding directors accountable for trouble that occurs on their watch. They should demand that executives forfeit compensation generated by fraudulent practices. And they must hold their mutual fund managers responsible for proxy voting practices that encourage excessive pay and cozy, somnambulant boards. If these managers don't vote against directors who hand out oversized pay for undersized performance, they are part of the problem and should be fired.</p>
        <p>As the Enron jury eloquently told us last week, silence in the face of these offenses gives consent.</p>
