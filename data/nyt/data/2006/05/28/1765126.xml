        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Tug of War Over Commuters'' (May 14), about DeCamp Bus Lines' lawsuit against New Jersey Transit, you report that Gary Pard, vice president and chief operating officer for DeCamp, testified that the company had not conducted surveys to determine why the company was losing riders because, as he put it, ''we know why.''</p>
        <p>No survey has been conducted because the results would not back the company's allegation.</p>

        <p>No survey has been conducted because the results would not back the company's allegation.</p>
        <p>Ridership losses began long before New Jersey Transit began Midtown Direct service, and were largely the result of dissatisfaction with very unreliable service, overcrowded buses, inconsistent schedules, often surly drivers (my apologies to the few who were the exceptions!) and a general lack of consideration for the ridership.</p>
        <p>At one point it seemed that DeCamp was attempting to overcome its losses through the introduction of new services to mid- and downtown Manhattan. But there was apparently no attempt to spread the word on these new routes.</p>
        <p>DeCamp's failure is the result of mismanagement, and it should not be subsidized by New Jersey Transit.</p>
