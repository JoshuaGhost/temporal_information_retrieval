        <p>The death last month of Stephen Molinaro, the 40-year-old son of the Staten Island borough president, was caused by a drug overdose, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>An autopsy completed on Friday ruled the cause of death as acute intoxication by the combined effects of alcohol, opiates, Valium and Xanax, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for Charles S. Hirsch, the city's chief medical examiner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Molinaro was the son of James P. Molinaro, who is serving his second term as Staten Island borough president. Pat Wilks, a spokeswoman for James Molinaro, said yesterday that he would have no comment on the findings, which were reported yesterday in The Daily News.</p>
        <p>Mr. Molinaro was not breathing when he was found April 29 inside his home on Lyman Avenue, in the Fort Wadsworth section of Staten Island. He had two children and worked as an operating engineer. He got into trouble in October 2004, when he was arrested for driving erratically. The police said they also found a marijuana cigarette in the car.</p>
        <p>Stephen Molinaro's 17-year-old son, Steven, has been arrested twice in the past three months. He was arrested in February with two other teenagers in connection with the beating and stabbing of a young man outside Public School 52.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, he was arrested on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges after the beating of a teenager, said William J. Smith, a spokesman for the Staten Island district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Steven Molinaro's lawyer, Joseph V. Sorrentino, said yesterday that his client was innocent in both cases. Mr. Sorrentino added that the alleged victim in the second case has given a statement saying that his client was not responsible for the beating.</p>
