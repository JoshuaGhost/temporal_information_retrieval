        <p>Jimmie Johnson does not attract much of a crowd when he steps out of his apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and heads to Central Park to jog or go skateboarding.

        <p>Jimmie Johnson does not attract much of a crowd when he steps out of his apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and heads to Central Park to jog or go skateboarding. The anonymity of the city is refreshing for one of the most high-profile drivers in Nascar's Nextel Cup series.</p>
        <p>Johnson and his wife, the model Chandra Johnson, have been part-time New Yorkers for years. That makes them an oddity in Nascar's tight circle around Charlotte, N.C. But even if Johnson does not always seek the spotlight, he has found fame and even a bit of infamy in his four-plus years on the Cup circuit.</p>
        <p>No driver in Cup competition has eclipsed the 21 victories Johnson has amassed since taking over the No. 48 Chevrolet at the start of the 2002 season. At the same time, perhaps no driver has seen as many fingers pointed or has had as many questions asked about his performances along the way.</p>
        <p>Now the conspiracy theorists are suggesting there is some nefarious reason for his success at Lowe's Motor Speedway -- the track that features the same sponsor as his No. 48 racecar. Johnson has a four-race winning streak at Lowe's and will try to extend that today at the Coca-Cola 600. He has won five of the last six Cup races at Lowe's and three 600's in a row.</p>
        <p>That does not include last week's victory at Lowe's in the Nextel All-Star Challenge, a nonpoints race that paid Johnson $1 million.</p>
        <p>''Some of the things I hear are just so unbelievable,'' said Rick Hendrick, owner of the Hendrick Motorsports stable, which includes Johnson, Jeff Gordon, Kyle Busch and Brian Vickers. ''You just can't be as clever as some people think.''</p>
        <p>Yet the No. 48 team has tried to be a little too clever at times, putting it at the center of a controversy that reached its height at the start of this season. Before the first race was run at Daytona International Speedway, Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was found to have illegally adjusted the rear window of the No. 48 during an inspection. On Feb. 13, the Monday before the season-opening Daytona 500, Knaus was ejected from the speedway. The next week, Nascar added three more races to his suspension.</p>
        <p>Even without Knaus, Johnson won the 500 on Feb. 19, and that raised even more ire. ''The victory was tainted, no doubt,'' said Ryan Newman, who finished third at Daytona and questioned Johnson's victory at the time.</p>
        <p>Whatever disappointment Johnson might have felt about a backlash, he showed little publicly, steadfastly defending his team.</p>
        <p>''That is the word people use to describe him and it's true,'' Chandra Johnson said of his temperament in a telephone interview Friday. ''I'm amazed at how he is at the racetrack. When he's at home, he's even more even-keeled.''</p>
        <p>But he is also different this year. In his fifth season of racing at the Cup level, Knaus says he believes Johnson is finally prepared to win a championship after coming so close. He has been in the top five in points in each of his seasons, including runner-up in 2003 and 2004.</p>
        <p>''I think Jimmie has matured a lot and he is ready as an individual to go out and win the championship,'' Knaus said after the victory in the All-Star Challenge. ''Although we have been in championship battles throughout all of our career, every season, I don't know that we were ready as a team, nor was Jimmie ready as a driver, to pull it all off. Now I think our team has matured enough and Jimmie has matured enough to actually go out there and do it.''</p>
        <p>Johnson has seemingly surpassed the four-time champion Gordon as the No. 1 contender among Cup hopefuls at Hendrick, and he is already showing signs that this could be his year. It began at Daytona, when he won with the interim crew chief Darian Grubb at the helm. The two combined for another victory March 12 at Las Vegas. And when the banishment ended for Knaus, Johnson earned another victory May 1 at Talladega.</p>
        <p>Johnson leads the points standings through 11 races and has finished in the top 12 in all but one race. Even Gordon, who owns the No. 48 under the Hendrick umbrella, acknowledges Johnson's status within the team.</p>
        <p>''We don't look at anybody at our organization as No. 1 or 'A' team,'' Gordon said, ''but they have definitely gotten the best results and they've been the best hope for a championship over the last several years.''</p>
        <p>The Knaus suspension may turn out to be the difference if Johnson wins it all this year.</p>
        <p>''The team is stronger from it all,'' Johnson said Thursday before qualifying third for the 600. ''As negative as it was, it was also a building opportunity for this race team and we maximized that.</p>
        <p>''We really got inside each other's heads. We better understand one another. We're a stronger race team. We're stronger individually. So there's been a lot of good coming from that bad thing.''</p>
        <p>Johnson cannot guarantee the team is strong enough to avoid the slump that has seemed to slow his momentum in past seasons. But he says he has not peaked yet, and that is different from previous years, when he had equally strong starts before watching as other teams surpassed him down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Last year, Stewart came on in June and went on to his second Cup points title in four years, with Johnson fading to fifth.</p>
        <p>This time, Johnson says his team can be even better than the performance to date. But even if he wins the title, will the stain taint it?</p>
        <p>''I think that would be the only unfortunate side of it is I know people would speculate things,'' Gordon said. ''But I also know that the only difference between them and most teams out there is that they've been caught. Everybody is out there pushing the limit of the rules some way.</p>
        <p>''A championship is a championship; a win is a win. Everybody wants to do it without there being anything that takes away from it. ''</p>
        <p>Hendrick, the team owner who recently extended Johnson's contract through 2010, said that he had made it clear to the No. 48 team that there would be no more infractions this season. The team has not been penalized again, and even Newman acknowledges that Johnson has earned what he has accomplished since then.</p>
        <p>For Johnson, Daytona is in the past. He will not let it color his future.</p>
        <p>''People don't forget and that's fine,'' he said. ''In my eyes, I'll look back and say, if we are able to win the championship, it may not be sweeter, but it's going to be more challenging and I'll be more proud inside that we were able to overcome four races without our crew chief, keep things moving, not lose our edge.''</p>
        <p>Then Johnson will return to relative anonymity in New York. Just the way he likes it.</p>
        <p>Asked if anybody recognizes him as he skateboards in Central Park, he said: ''Not a clue. It's beautiful.''</p>
        <p>MCMURRAY AND STEWART CRASH -- Jamie McMurray and Tony Stewart went to the hospital after separate accidents Saturday night in the Busch Series race.</p>
        <p>Both went to Carolinas Medical Center-University, where they were released after short checkups. McMurray hit the wall three laps into the race.</p>
        <p>Stewart hit almost the same place seven laps later and was rubbing his right shoulder when he got out of his car. ''I have one spot on my right shoulder blade that is really sore, so I'm going to get some X-rays,'' he said. (AP)</p>
