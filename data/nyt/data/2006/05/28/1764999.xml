      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As Memorial Day opens the beach season, the shores of Long Island and New Jersey will teem with sunburned masses. But for pure nostalgia and intriguing restaurants, it's hard to beat Coney Island and Brighton Beach.</p>
        <p>CAFE GLECHIK  (718) 616-0494; 3159 Coney Island Avenue (Brighton Beach Avenue), Brighton Beach; $; $25 and Under: 5/10/06.  Dumplings are the main attraction at this Russian-Ukrainian restaurant a block from the Riegelmann Boardwalk. Vareniki, crescent-shaped dumplings less bulky than pirogi, are offered with nine stuffings, including sweet farmer cheese, salted farmer cheese and sour cherry.</p>
        <p>If meat-stuffed dumplings are what the evening calls for, the pelmeni -- almost shu mai-like in their crinkled delicacy -- aren't to be ignored. Three varieties are on offer: chicken, veal or a hearty mix of pork and veal called Siberia.</p>
        <p>GARGIULO'S  (718) 266-4891; 2911 West 15th Street (Mermaid Avenue), Coney Island; $$; Article: 11/06/02.  Rumor has it that Al Capone was a busboy at this old-time family-run Neapolitan restaurant, which opened in 1907 in the heart of Coney Island. The large menu is everything you would expect it to be, with appetizers like baked clams, stuffed mushrooms, eggplant and peppers and fish salad, an array of pasta dishes and risottos offered in full or half portions, and entrees like lobster fra diavolo, shrimp scampi and veal scallopine.</p>
        <p>NATHAN'S FAMOUS  (718) 946-2202; 1310 Surf Avenue (Stillwell Avenue), Coney Island; $; Article: 5/25/05.  Nathan Handwerker, egged on by his friends Jimmy Durante and Eddie Cantor, opened this hot dog stand in 1916 to cater to the many poor and working-class people frequenting Coney Island. The Nathan's in Coney Island still serves an excellent natural-casing all-beef hot dog. Avoid the skinless all-beef dog that is a pale imitation.</p>
        <p>PRIMORSKI  (718) 891-3111; 282 Brighton Beach Avenue (Brighton Third Street), Brighton Beach; $$; Article: 4/7/00.  Primorski is one of those overflowing Brighton Beach restaurants where excess is the rule. It's Russian but it's not Imperial Russian, so the caviar is salmon caviar, which is fine. The point is not connoisseurship but enjoyment, with a five-piece band and dancing thrown in. The menu features more than 150 selections of cold appetizers, hot appetizers, seafood and meat.</p>
        <p>TOTONNO PIZZERIA  (718) 372-8606; 1524 Neptune Avenue (West 15th Street), Coney Island; $; Article: 11/6/02.  Totonno's, one of the early giants of New York coal-oven pizza, is legendary for its devotion to artisanal pies served in humble surroundings; the pressed-tin walls are covered with testimonials. With its site in a small Italian bastion, Totonno's almost feels as if it's in another city.</p>
