        <p>Between now and his last day in office, Gov. George E. Pataki is likely to make dozens of appointments to the state's regulatory boards. Many are appointments the next governor, whoever he is, will have to live with for years.</p>
        <p>But one of the nominations that Mr. Pataki submitted to the State Senate this month raised a few eyebrows here.</p>
        <p>The nomination was for the daughter of a powerful lobbyist to a second consecutive term on the state Workers' Compensation Board. And as the calendar had it, her next term would begin at just the moment Mr. Pataki left office -- firmly keeping her in office until 2013.</p>
        <p>Think of it, as one official put it, as a midnight appointment made at 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>After being questioned about the appointment, the governor's office pulled back on the nomination of the woman, Ellen O. Paprocki.</p>
        <p>''While we're confident that we have legal authority, we are holding the nomination to review the issues that have been raised,'' said Michael Marr, a spokesman for the governor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Paprocki is the daughter of John F. O'Mara, who is one of Mr. Pataki's closest advisers and an influential lobbyist in Albany. Ms. Paprocki is already on the Workers' Compensation Board, receiving an annual salary of $90,800. She was appointed in 2001, and her current term would have expired in 2007.</p>
        <p>But another member of the board, Jeffrey Sweet, resigned this year, and by moving Ms. Paprocki to his spot, the governor would be able to let that term expire at the end of this year. He would then nominate her for another full seven-year term, according to Pataki administration officials.</p>
        <p>In essence, her term would be renewed in the waning hours of Mr. Pataki's time in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marr said that criticism arose soon after the nomination was submitted to the Republican-controlled State Senate on June 7. Some Democrats in the Senate raised questions, he said, and the Pataki administration agreed to put the nomination on hold.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Paprocki's name will not be included on the list of more than 100 nominees the Senate is expected to confirm on Tuesday. And it was unclear last night when, or if, the nomination would be resubmitted.</p>
