        <p>Gov. Bill Owens called the legislature into special session for next week to talk about immigration. Earlier this month, the State Supreme Court struck down a proposed ballot initiative that would have barred illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency state and local services, and on Monday the court declined to reconsider. Mr. Owens, a Republican, said the Democratic-controlled legislature should either fashion a new referendum similar to the one invalidated by the court and send it on to the voters, or pass legislation that would address the same issues.</p>
