        <p>Spurred by recent cases in which club bouncers were arrested in connection with the deaths of patrons, the City Council held hearings yesterday on proposed legislation that would penalize club owners who hire unlicensed security guards or who fail to keep licensing paperwork on the premises. The measure would allow the Police Department and the Department of Consumer Affairs to close clubs or bars that violate such regulations. Bar owners testifying at the hearing said they welcomed stricter licensing for door personnel but asked that the new regulations apply only to those involved in security. The bill was prompted by three recent incidents involving security guards, including the murder last February of Imette St. Guillen, a college student. Darryl Littlejohn, a bouncer who worked at the SoHo bar that Ms. St. Guillen visited, has been charged with her murder. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
