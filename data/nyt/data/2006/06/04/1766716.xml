        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When Henry James returned to New York City a century ago after 20 years abroad (''The Old Neighborhood,'' May 28), it was not only his old downtown neighborhood whose changes amazed him.</p>
        <p>In ''The Hudson,'' Tom Lewis writes of James's astonishment at finding Columbia University moved from Madison Avenue and 49th Street to a new campus on upper Broadway. He also marveled at the great historical structures of Grant's Tomb and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in their Riverside Park settings, both of them enjoying, as he put it, ''the great perspective of the River.''</p>
