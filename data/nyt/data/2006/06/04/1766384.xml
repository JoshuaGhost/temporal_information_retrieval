        <p>HARD as it is to imagine, horse racing used to be nearly as popular as baseball, so rich in prize money and the profits from fixed races that Babe Ruth once demanded the Red Sox pay him as much as a top jockey. The Babe's asking price was $15,000 for one season, or about five grand less than Winfield O'Connor, only 15, had earned as a contract rider in 1900. Dressed in a white vest with $5 gold pieces for buttons, Winnie relished the role of superstar and shared the spotlight with some famous African-American jockeys, none more extraordinary than Jimmy Winkfield, the subject of Joe Drape's ''Black Maestro.''</p>
        <p>Born to sharecroppers in the Kentucky Bluegrass in 1882, Winkfield caught the racing bug as a pint-size kid and began working as a groom and exercise rider not long after. Since the days of slavery, as Drape notes, owners in the Deep South had trusted blacks with their horses. As a black stable hand put it, the track was one of two places on earth where all men were created equal -- on the turf and under it. Still, Winkfield didn't have it easy. White riders banged him around, and the stewards hampered him. After his first race, in Chicago, he was suspended for a year over a questionable infraction.</p>
        <p>Yet Winkfield survived, improved and won the Kentucky Derby twice, in 1901 and 1902. Along the way, he met a lot of eccentric characters, whom Drape captures wonderfully in cameos -- Father Bill Daly, for instance, a wooden-legged New York trainer and owner (but not a priest), who preyed on Irish street urchins, schooled them as jockeys and beat them if they rode badly; and the inimitable Winnie O'Connor, whose pasty face ''was often black-and-blue from his third career as an amateur prizefighter.'' His second was as a competitive cyclist.</p>
        <p>The success of black riders led to a backlash, especially in the East. When Winkfield tried to crack the New York circuit, he got nowhere because white jockeys had formed ''an anti-colored union.'' The rides began to dry up in Kentucky, too, thanks to Jim Crow, so he headed to Russia, where he took the drastic step of signing on as a stable jockey to Gen. Michael Lazarev, an Armenian oil magnate. Winkfield was 21, stood five feet tall and couldn't speak a word of Russian.</p>
        <p>Drape's impeccable research lends this aspect of the story scope and drama. In Moscow, Winkfield rode so brilliantly that he joined the city's elite and married Alexandra Yalovicina, a beautiful White Russian. In Poland, he won the Warsaw Derby and became known as the Black Maestro. Even when the war broke out in 1914 and his apartment turned into a halfway house for wounded soldiers, he stayed busy until he was forced to move to quieter Odessa, leaving behind his wife and child.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the Red Army reached Odessa as well, and Winkfield joined Frederick Jurjevich, a Polish horseman, on an incredible mission -- herding 262 horses to Warsaw, so they wouldn't be cannon fodder. Afterward, he set up shop in Paris as a jockey, married another Russian woman and began training, only to be uprooted again by World War II. He departed for the United States in 1941 with $9 in his pocket and started over as a 60-year-old groom in South Carolina, although his tale doesn't end there. (He died in France in 1974.)</p>
        <p>Drape's narrative gallops along at a sprightly pace. ''Black Maestro'' reminds us how important black riders were in those early days, a fact that's often overlooked or forgotten. The author, who writes about horse racing and other sports for The New York Times, does justice to an amazing life, but jockeys don't typically keep journals or write revealing letters, so we're left with a portrait that lacks psychological depth. Perhaps that's as it should be for a man of action, and there's more than enough action to satisfy.</p>
        <p>Another legendary figure undergoes close scrutiny in Dorothy Ours's ''Man o' War.'' Arguably the greatest American racehorse, Man o' War burst onto the scene just when the sport needed some fresh blood to wake it from</p>
        <p>the doldrums of a nationwide antigambling crusade. In 1911, only Kentucky, Maryland</p>
        <p>and Virginia offered state-sanctioned races with betting. New York was a wasteland until August Belmont Jr., the chairman of the Jockey Club, revived racing that same year with a ''legal compromise'' that allowed bookies to take wagers, although only via oral agreements with hundreds of ''friends.''</p>
        <p>Belmont bred Man o' War, named in honor of his own efforts as a wartime major. By Fair Play out of Mahubah, the foal, who later acquired the nickname Big Red, was a tall chestnut with an impressive girth, so crucial for heart and lung capacity. Needing cash, Belmont took his yearling to the Fasig-Tipton Company's sale at Saratoga Springs in 1918. Though Man o' War acted high-strung and looked ragged from a recent bout of distemper, Sam and Elizabeth Riddle plunked down $5,000 for him on the advice of Lou Feustel, their trainer, and their friend Jim Maddux, who was thought to be ''unexcelled as a judge of horseflesh.''</p>
        <p>When Man o' War proved to be a diamond in the rough, all the principals wanted some credit for spotting him, and Ours (who used to work at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame) cleverly conveys their wrangling. Like Drape, she has a passion for research, although she seems to include every fact she's uncovered, not always for the better. She approaches each of Big Red's races in the same way, describing the track, the crowd, the weather and so on, and these passages become repetitive. But she's good at sketching characters quickly, as she does with Feustel, who looked ''as if the sculptor who had molded him got distracted before giving him a final polish.''</p>
        <p>''Man o' War'' is clearly a labor of love, and it certifies Big Red's claim to immortality. The colt won 20 of his 21 races, usually carrying lots of weight, and his only loss -- to the aptly named Upset -- may well have been the work of a crooked jockey. Indeed, Big Red was so feared that few owners would run against him. His final race was a match against Sir Barton, the first Triple Crown winner, at Kenilworth Park in Canada for a pot of $75,000. Man o' War left Sir Barton in the dust, but he came back to the barn with a bruised foreleg and was soon retired.</p>
        <p>At the Riddles' Faraway Farm in Kentucky, Big Red became a major attraction. ''Tourists ask first where they can find him and then where they can find the Mammoth Cave,'' the farm's manager said. When Man o' War died in 1947 after several heart attacks, his funeral ceremony, ''including nine eulogies and a bugler playing 'Taps,' '' was broadcast around the country. His story lives on, a treat for die-hard fans.</p>
