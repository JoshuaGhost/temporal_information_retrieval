        <p>The spectacle of wayward corporate chiefs being sentenced to hard time in real prisons is not strictly an American phenomenon, despite the attention given to Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling at Enron, L. Dennis Kozlowski at Tyco, Bernard J. Ebbers at WorldCom, Martha Stewart, et al.</p>
        <p>Executives around the world have also been sent to jail -- or have been given big fines.</p>
        <p>Just last week, a court in Seoul sentenced the founder and former chairman of Daewoo to 10 years in prison and ordered him to forfeit $22 billion. It found the executive, Kim Woo Choong, 69, guilty of a multibillion-dollar accounting fraud.</p>
        <p>Even Sweden got tough last week, dispatching a former chief of the insurer Skandia to prison for two years. A court found the executive, Lars-Eric Petersson, 55, guilty of fraud for authorizing $21.5 million in bonuses without board approval.</p>
        <p>Some courts still have a soft spot for chief executives, though. A Dutch court recently fined Cees van der Hoeven, Ahold's former chief executive, and A. Michiel Meurs, its former finance chief, $288,000 each after convicting them of fraud, but it did not send them to jail, as prosecutors had asked. Ahold had overstated its earnings by more than $1 billion from 1999 to 2002, mostly by inflating sales at its U.S. Foodservice unit.</p>
