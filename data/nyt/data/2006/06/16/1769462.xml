        <p>A leading Democrat in the New York Congressional delegation yesterday criticized Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democratic candidate for governor, faulting his association with a wealthy Republican benefactor who opposes Democrats in Washington.</p>
        <p>The Congressional leader, Representative Charles B. Rangel, said that Mr. Suozzi should return the thousands of dollars he has received from the supporter, Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot.</p>
        <p>''Some of us believe that the Republican Party has taken our state of New York, as well as our nation, in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Rangel wrote in a letter to Mr. Suozzi, which was also distributed to reporters. ''I certainly thought that you were one of us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi retorted just hours later, saying that he was a loyal Democrat and that he and Mr. Langone ''fundamentally disagree on this issue.''</p>
        <p>''I am a proud lifelong Democrat who fervently believes in taking back the Congress for our party,'' Mr. Suozzi wrote in response to Mr. Rangel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rangel has endorsed Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general, in the governor's race. Mr. Spitzer has received the support of most Democratic elected officials statewide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Langone, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange compensation committee, has been one of the subjects of a civil suit from Mr. Spitzer's office over pay for a top executive. Mr. Langone has promised considerable financial backing to Mr. Suozzi in the campaign.</p>
        <p>At a fund-raiser this week for former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Langone spoke of the need to keep Republicans in power in Washington, in the House and the Senate.</p>
        <p>''This is a critical time,'' Mr. Langone said. ''It's not a time to turn the asylum over to the inmates.''</p>
        <p>In his response letter, Mr. Suozzi pointed out several issues where he said Mr. Rangel and Mr. Spitzer had parted ways.</p>
        <p>''Eliot Spitzer supported the Iraq war, which you opposed,'' Mr. Suozzi wrote. ''Eliot Spitzer supports the death penalty, which you do not.''</p>
