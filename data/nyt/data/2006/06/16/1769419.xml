        <p>At 6:20 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, Regina and Renata Salinas Fierros, born as one, became two for the first time when doctors made the final incision in a long and complicated operation to separate the 10-month-old conjoined twins.</p>

        <p>At 6:20 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, Regina and Renata Salinas Fierros, born as one, became two for the first time when doctors made the final incision in a long and complicated operation to separate the 10-month-old conjoined twins.</p>
        <p>After that, the girls underwent a series of surgical procedures that lasted until early yesterday morning. A team of 80 doctors and medical assistants divided their shared intestines, liver and other organs, and turned one girl's pelvis around so her legs would face the right way.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, the babies, who were placed in separate beds for the first time in their short lives, were in serious condition in the intensive care unit of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, with stable vital signs.</p>
        <p>''We are all obviously extremely excited at how things went,'' Dr. James E. Stein, the pediatric surgeon who led the operation, said at a news briefing held with a panel of doctors who took part in the surgery. ''There were no particular surprises.''</p>
        <p>The doctors said the first 48 hours would be critical to see how the girls recover. But for the most part, the beaming doctors said they were optimistic about the twins' prognosis.</p>
        <p>''Our expectation is that they will recover from this completely and will go on to lead very, very normal lives,'' Dr. Stein said.</p>
        <p>The girls' parents, Sonia Fierros, 23, and Federico Salinas, 36, who are from Ju√°rez, Mexico, said they were grateful to the doctors and to everyone who has supported them since they learned last spring that they would have conjoined twins. The girls were born facing each other on Aug. 2, 2005, fused from the lower chest to the pelvis.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Fierros was asked at the briefing what she wished for her children, she wiped away tears and answered in Spanish, ''to see our daughters run, go to a normal school, to prepare themselves for life, to enjoy everything that life has to offer.''</p>
        <p>The marathon procedure began at 6 a.m. Wednesday, and doctors had thought that it would take 24 hours to separate the girls and to reconstruct their tiny bodies after they divided some of the organs the two shared.</p>
        <p>But the operation ended several hours earlier than expected. Regina was wheeled out of the operating room and into the intensive care unit at 2:47 a.m., with Renata following at 3:58 a.m.</p>
        <p>The girls were a rare form of conjoined twins called ischiopagus tetrapus, Greek for hip fixed and ''fetus with four feet,'' the hospital said. They present a particular challenge in separation surgery because they share many organ systems.</p>
        <p>While the Salinas girls had separate heads, necks, shoulders, hearts, lungs, arms and legs, they shared a liver, intestines and urinary, reproductive, vascular and musculoskeletal systems. Regina was born with one kidney.</p>
        <p>Only a few hundred pairs of conjoined twins are born each year worldwide. In the United States, they occur once in every 200,000 live births. Of those, only 10 percent are fused together along the chest in the way that Regina and Renata were, with their shared organs.</p>
        <p>As the operation got under way, doctors made an incision at the breastbone, and then moved on to the complicated business of dividing the organs. Dr. Stein said doctors had separated the liver, split the diaphragm and separated their pelvic organs.</p>
        <p>He said doctors decided to give most of the small intestine to Regina, because she was the smaller of the two, and most of the large intestine to Renata.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stein said that the girls might have some bowel problems later, but that it was too early to tell whether their bodies would adjust to the new intestinal arrangement.</p>
        <p>More than 12 hours into the surgery, the last pelvic bone connecting the babies was cut, and there was an ''orderly calm'' in the operating room as doctors moved one of the twins to another room, a hospital spokesman said.</p>
        <p>It was a moment that made the surgeons and others in the room pause.</p>
        <p>''There was something very surreal about that,'' Dr. Stein said. ''We became very aware of the fact that the next 8 to 12 hours was potentially the most challenging, getting everything all hooked up.''</p>
        <p>Doctors said there had been enough skin on both babies to close all their incisions once they reconstructed their organs and bone structure. There will be some scarring, they said, and the girls face years of physical therapy and other treatments to help them learn to walk and function as other children do.</p>
        <p>''There is a possibility that they will need more surgery down the line,'' Dr. Stein said. But, he said, the operation will mean that the girls ''will be able to walk across the street rather than be wheeled across the street -- it will be a huge lifestyle change for them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fierros learned she would have conjoined twins when she was hospitalized with a urinary tract infection while in Los Angeles to visit relatives. The couple decided to stay in Los Angeles on extended tourist visas because they thought their babies would receive better medical care there.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stein said the hospital had begun assembling the team that separated the girls the second day after they were born. But he said the decision to proceed with the surgery was a long one that involved an ethics board meeting to make sure it was the best step for the twins.</p>
