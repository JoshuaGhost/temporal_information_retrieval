        <p>Under pressure from Congress and some of its own senior generals, the Pentagon is backing away from including a classified set of interrogation techniques in a new Army field manual, Pentagon and Senate officials said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Defense Department is also expected to drop a plan to have one set of interrogation methods for detainees that the military considers ''unlawful combatants,'' like detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and another set for traditional prisoners of war captured on the battlefield, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Some military officials and top aides to Vice President Dick Cheney have insisted it is essential to have a secret set of techniques and to leave ambiguous just how far American interrogators could go to extract information from terror suspects.</p>
        <p>But lawmakers from both parties, State Department officials and human rights organizations argued that detainees would eventually disclose the secret interrogation techniques and that keeping them secret would only reinforce the perception abroad that the United States condoned torture as an interrogation method.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press first reported the change on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Senior Pentagon and State Department officials warned Tuesday that while the administration was moving in the direction of making public all interrogation techniques or removing some completely from the manual, a final policy had not yet been set and further changes could be made.</p>
        <p>''I think we are getting close to a resolution,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England said in a brief interview on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has held that many captives in the campaign against terrorism are not entitled to the same protections as prisoners of war. And that seemed to be an underlying principle of revisions to a long-delayed Army field manual, used by commanders, interrogators and military lawyers, that has been the subject of an internal administration debate for more than a year.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the classified techniques, which would be in an annex of the manual, and of two sets of methods for different types of prisoners said they were all valuable tools against a variety of detainees trained in Qaeda camps on how to resist allied interrogations.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon began reversing course last month, after three senior Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, John W. Warner of Virginia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, expressed strong reservations about the draft field manual in meetings with Mr. England and letters to him.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham said having two sets of interrogation techniques would violate the legislation that Mr. McCain sponsored and that was enacted last December to bar cruel and inhumane treatment of American detainees. The measure requires that only interrogation techniques authorized by the new Army field manual be used on prisoners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner argued against publishing a classified annex to the field manual with exacting details about which procedures may or may not be used, and in what circumstances. The entire manual should be open to public review, he said.</p>
        <p>''I asked them to weigh carefully the need for the classified version because it could begin to undermine what I anticipate and hope will be a strong acceptance for an open revision to the field manual,'' Mr. Warner said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In addition to the lawmakers' complaints, some senior generals also objected. At a recent meeting of the nation's top worldwide commanders, Gen. John P. Abizaid, the head of the Central Command, and Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, said the new interrogation techniques had to be clear and unambiguous ''so our corporals in the field can understand them,'' said a military officer briefed on the remarks.</p>
        <p>A senior Defense Department official, who was granted anonymity because the new field manual has not yet been approved, said: ''If this debate were limited to what's best for interrogation purposes, the decision would be pretty easy. But then you have to look at what you lose diplomatically.''</p>
        <p>Human rights groups applauded the apparent shift in the Pentagon's position.</p>
        <p>''If the Pentagon is stepping back from that, it's a welcome sign that they now understand the need for transparency and clarity,'' said Elisa Massimino, Washington director of Human Rights First.</p>
