        <p>Although work is under way on the foundation of the Freedom Tower, a top official cast new doubt yesterday on whether the signature skyscraper's steel frame would ever rise above street level.</p>
        <p>The 1,776-foot high tower will have to be reconsidered if state officials fail to obtain leases for one million square feet from federal agencies by September, Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, told a breakfast forum sponsored by Crain's New York Business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coscia has made similar statements before, but this was his most explicit warning to date, with the fifth anniversary of Sept. 11 soon approaching. Also yesterday, Senator Charles E. Schumer called on the two dozen insurers at ground zero to make good on their commitments to provide a total of $4.6 billion for rebuilding at the World Trade Center site.</p>
        <p>Larry Silverstein, the developer who leased the trade center six weeks before 9/11, warned last month that some insurers were indicating they might cite a new plan put together by state and city officials to renege on their obligations. ''Business-as-usual tactics like talking tough, threatening litigation and stalling are just not acceptable when it comes to rebuilding ground zero,'' Mr. Schumer said in a statement. ''We have a plan to move forward. What we don't have is explicit certainty from all the relevant insurance companies that they will make the payouts necessary to finance rebuilding.''</p>
        <p>Both men's comments raised new questions about the Freedom Tower, a project long promoted by Gov. George E. Pataki, who leaves office in December.</p>
        <p>The project has been criticized by some real estate executives and civic leaders, who have called it too big, in the wrong location and unlikely to attract corporate tenants. The Democratic nominee for governor, Eliot Spitzer, has expressed concern that it could turn into ''a white elephant.''</p>
        <p>Under the latest arrangement at ground zero, Mr. Silverstein would build three towers on the site, but he surrendered the most financially troublesome project, the 2.6-million-square-foot Freedom Tower. Mr. Coscia, in turn, agreed that the Port Authority would build it, but only if it were financially feasible.</p>
        <p>To get the project on a sound footing, the Pataki administration agreed in April to contribute $250 million and to round up leases for one million square feet from federal agencies -- at market rates of up to $50 a square foot -- by September. Those leases would allow the authority to get a mortgage, which, combined with $970 million in insurance proceeds, would cover most of the cost of the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coscia, who said he remained hopeful, did not indicate specifically what would happen if the federal leases fail to materialize by September, although the tower's opponents hope a new governor will abandon it. Mr. Coscia said that the foundation work for the tower would have to be done anyway to bring the site up to street level.</p>
        <p>''I think there's every reason to be optimistic that the state will get the leases,'' Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said. ''Coscia's just sounding the bell to remind people that we've got to get this done.''</p>
        <p>State officials also expressed confidence. ''The Freedom Tower will serve as a testament to our resiliency as a people, a city and a country and will reclaim our city's skyline,'' said Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for the governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coscia also told the breakfast forum that the Port Authority was willing to take on construction of the 9/11 memorial as long as there is a financial plan for the project. The estimated cost of the memorial has swelled to $1 billion, but a report to Mr. Pataki due tomorrow is expected to outline a series of alternatives for a memorial that would stay within a $500 million budget.</p>
        <p>''There should be an understanding of where all the money necessary to build the memorial is coming from and also a plan for its operating expense going forward,'' Mr. Coscia said. ''I don't think the Port Authority should be responsible for cost overruns. I don't think we should be responsible for covering operating expenses.''</p>
