        <p>Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's office said Tuesday that she would shortly sign into law a strict ban on abortion that would permit abortion only in the case where a woman's life was threatened by pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The bill, approved by both houses of the Legislature and sent to the governor on Monday, would go into effect only if the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, and allowed states to criminalize abortion.</p>

        <p>Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco's office said Tuesday that she would shortly sign into law a strict ban on abortion that would permit abortion only in the case where a woman's life was threatened by pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The bill, approved by both houses of the Legislature and sent to the governor on Monday, would go into effect only if the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, and allowed states to criminalize abortion.</p>
        <p>In March, South Dakota enacted a law criminalizing abortion, hoping to create a case that would lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. Eleven other states are considering similar measures. Six other states have bans, similar to the Louisiana bill, that would be put into effect by the end of Roe.</p>
        <p>A sponsor of the Louisiana bill, Senator Ben Nevers, Democrat of Bogalusa, said he had led the effort because the Supreme Court had grown more conservative and the time was ripe for change.</p>
        <p>''I had a strong belief that we could finally protect the innocent life of an unborn child,'' Mr. Nevers said. ''This is about the U.S. Constitution granting every person the right to life.''</p>
        <p>Jacqueline Payne, assistant director of government relations for Planned Parenthood, a nationwide provider of abortion services, said the trigger provision allowed the Legislature and Ms. Blanco to inflict policy on future generations they had no authority to represent, since Roe could take several years to overturn, if ever.</p>
        <p>''We think Louisiana is hiding behind South Dakota, which took more of a direct affront,'' Ms. Payne said.</p>
        <p>Roderick K. Hawkins, deputy press secretary to the governor, said that the abortion bill had not yet reached Ms. Blanco, but that she planned to sign it as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, has supported exceptions for rape and incest in the past, Mr. Hawkins said she found solace in the bill's ''safety measures'' that protect the life of the pregnant woman.</p>
        <p>''The governor has always been a pro-life person,'' Mr. Hawkins said, ''and this fits into her beliefs of supporting life and being anti-abortion. Plus, this had overwhelming bipartisan support of the Legislature.''</p>
        <p>If signed by the governor, Louisiana's measure would allow the prosecution of any person who performed or aided in an abortion. The penalties include up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000.</p>
