        <p>New Jersey State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., the son of a former governor and grandson of a former congressman, captured the Republican nomination for United States Senate last night, easily defeating an unheralded challenger from the party's right wing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean's victory set the stage for a much-anticipated battle against Senator Robert Menendez, who defeated token opposition in the Democratic primary. With early polls indicating a tight race, the contest figures to be one of the most scrutinized and expensive races in the country, as Democrats in Washington try desperately to retake the Senate.</p>
        <p>One question heading into last night's election was whether Mr. Kean's challenger, John P. Ginty, a financial-data analyst, would siphon enough conservative votes to cause concern about the firmness of conservative support for Mr. Kean in November. By late last night, with more than half the precincts reporting, Mr. Ginty had garnered a respectable 24 percent of the vote, suggesting conservatives' discontent with Mr. Kean.</p>
        <p>Well before the primary, however, the race for November had already begun to take shape, with Mr. Kean attacking Mr. Menendez as a corrupt political boss with dubious character, and Mr. Menendez linking Mr. Kean with President Bush. That strategy continued last night in both men's victory speeches.</p>
        <p>The first to speak was Mr. Menendez. As the public address system played Tom Petty's ''I Won't Back Down,'' he was introduced by a fiery Gov. Jon S. Corzine, and flanked by his two children, Alicia and Robert, at the East Brunswick Hilton.</p>
        <p>''On issue after issue, the facts are clear: Tom Kean Jr. and George Bush are perfect together -- perfectly wrong for New Jersey,'' Mr. Menendez said. ''Tom Kean Jr. will choose to side with George Bush, and New Jersey needs a senator who will stand up to President Bush. And I will be that type of United States senator.''</p>
        <p>About 15 minutes later, it was Mr. Kean's turn, at a restaurant in Mountainside. With his wife, Rhonda, at his side, and the crowd chanting, ''Go, Tom, go!'' he fired back: ''Tonight I have news for Bob Menendez -- he's not running against George Bush; he's running against Tom Kean.''</p>
        <p>He continued, ''The people of New Jersey can no longer afford a Hudson County party boss who puts politics first and people second. We need to elect a United States senator who will bring a true moral compass to office.''</p>
        <p>The senate primary was the only statewide race, and turnout was meager, although there were notable local races with at least an element of suspense.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing, perhaps, was the race for the House seat that Mr. Menendez vacated when he was appointed in December by Mr. Corzine to serve out his Senate term. That race, between two Democratic assemblymen, Albio Sires and Joseph Vas, was also one of the most bitter, replete with personal insults. Mr. Sires, backed by the state's top Democrats, won by a ratio of three to one.</p>
        <p>Another intriguing race was for the Republican nomination for Bergen County executive. Bergen, the state's most populous county, is typically a crucial district for any statewide candidate in November.</p>
        <p>Months ago, the conservative party establishment named Todd C. Caliguire, a former county freeholder, to take on the Democratic incumbent, Dennis McNerney, in November. But an insurgent moderate slate emerged, led by Kathleen Donovan, the county clerk. Still, Ms. Donovan conceded late last night, and Mr. Caliguire appeared headed to certain victory.</p>
        <p>Still, most of the attention centered on the Senate race, with many Democrats and Republicans predicting that it would be coarse, and that each candidate would need to spend up to $20 million to prevail.</p>
        <p>As of May 17, Mr. Menendez had $6.4 million, and Mr. Kean had $1.8 million. Already, the two have agreed to two debates by the end of this month, which is unusually early.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean, 37, won election to the State Assembly in 2001, was tapped by party officials to fill a State Senate vacancy in 2003, and won re-election the same year. He has espoused a mix of moderate and conservative positions on social issues, and has emphasized governmental ethics. But his biggest asset, Republicans and Democrats agree, is his name, as the son of Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who was a popular governor in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez, 52, , is New Jersey's first Hispanic senator. The son of Cuban immigrants, he served as a school board member, mayor and state legislator before being elected to Congress in 1992. As a senator, he has been vocal on issues like the Dubai ports controversy, immigration and stem cell research.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he introduced legislation urging the adoption of all 41 of the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission, whose former chairman, was his opponent's father.</p>
        <p>When asked after his son's speech about Mr. Menendez's bill, former Governor Kean said, ''I hope he's not just doing it for re-election.''</p>
