        <p>Petites Anatomies, Petites Images  Ubu Gallery  416 East 59th Street, Manhattan  Through July 28</p>
        <p>Drawings, Photographs and Prints  Miguel Abreu Gallery  36 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side  Through July 2</p>
        <p>Hans Bellmer (1902-75), the girl-crazed German Surrealist, is not exactly an unknown quantity, but these two exhibitions expand one's sense of him, if not always in nice ways. The Ubu exhibition takes you deep into Bellmer's working method in the late 1930's, when he was most involved with photography. Its 76 vintage prints and contact images, many exhibited for the first time, mostly feature Bellmer's signature female dolls, which he constructed so that their exaggerated limbs, torsos, heads and so forth could be detached and rearranged. Mixed with household items (a caned chair, bedspreads, pillows, a carpet beater), they appeared in the small books he produced in 1935 and 1949, hand-tipped onto the pages and often hand-colored.</p>

        <p>Hans Bellmer (1902-75), the girl-crazed German Surrealist, is not exactly an unknown quantity, but these two exhibitions expand one's sense of him, if not always in nice ways. The Ubu exhibition takes you deep into Bellmer's working method in the late 1930's, when he was most involved with photography. Its 76 vintage prints and contact images, many exhibited for the first time, mostly feature Bellmer's signature female dolls, which he constructed so that their exaggerated limbs, torsos, heads and so forth could be detached and rearranged.

        <p>The small size of the images accents the shut-in, forbidden quality of Bellmer's art; they are like amulets or fetishes. They also show how he photographed the same arrangements from slightly different angles subtly varying light, space and feeling, and then went on to experiment with print size and coloration. A few of the images show real women, including a kneeling nude on a beach seen from behind that is made strange simply because her toes are buried in the sand.</p>
        <p>The show at Miguel Abreu, a new gallery on the Lower East Side, concentrates on Bellmer's late drawing and prints. Their networks of fine, spidery line are extrapolated from and ensnare the female body, although there are occasional male elements as well. Some are layered, like film montage, and nearly abstract, others verge on the pornographic and bring to mind the photographs of real women at the uptown gallery. When Bellmer draws high-heel shoes, he might almost have been Vargas, except he wasn't.</p>
