        <p>FANS of the work of Robert Havell Jr., the 19th-century Westchester County resident and artist best known as the engraver of John James Audubon's vaunted ''Birds of America'' series, were impressed with a recent lot of his work offered by Sotheby's in Manhattan. Nineteen paintings, prints, sketches and engravings were put up for bid on June 15; 17 sold, for a total of $665,000.</p>
        <p>But one work that Havell collectors would have been delighted to see was a mural that has been missing from Mr. Havell's Ossining home for almost 20 years. Its whereabouts has been a mystery ever since.</p>
        <p>Mr. Havell moved to Ossining in 1841 and bought a five-acre hillside plot with panoramic views of the Hudson River below. He built a two-story wood-frame house there called Rocky Mount, with a cupola on the roof. On the inside walls of the cupola, he painted a bucolic mural depicting the view.</p>
        <p>Mr. Havell left Ossining in 1857 and moved to Tarrytown, where he died in 1878. Records indicate the house changed hands several times before being bought by the Faiella family in 1901.</p>
        <p>The Faiellas lived in the house for generations. Word of the cupola mural circulated, and the Faiellas occasionally let historians, teachers and art students come into the house to see it. A 1981 snapshot, now in the possession of the Ossining Historical Society, shows the mural painted on two sections of white clapboard with a verdant Croton Point reaching into the river and sailboats dotting the water under a dramatic veil of clouds.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Joseph A. Faiella sold the property for $350,000 to Antonio Velardo Inc., a construction company, which razed the house and built a residential development on the land in the mid-1990's. There was a brief campaign to save the house in the late 1980's, and news articles mentioned the cupola paintings. In 1988, Mr. Faiella told a local newspaper that he had removed the mural from the cupola. ''I've got it put away,'' he was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>Mario Velardo, vice president of the construction company, recalls climbing a creaky ladder into the cupola with a few Ossining officials to verify that the mural sections were gone before tearing the house down. ''God only knows where they are at this point,'' Mr. Velardo said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faiella died in 1993 without publicly disclosing the location of the mural. The historical society said that his grandson, Jaime Faiella, who lives in Ossining, had told the group that he remembered seeing the mural as a child, but had no idea what happened to it. He could not be reached for comment last week.</p>
        <p>''We've talked to every member of the Faiella family,'' said Roberta Y. Arminio, executive director of the historical society. ''Nobody knows what happened to them.''</p>
        <p>She said that art dealers, historians and longtime Ossining residents still occasionally inquired about the mural, and she has heard rumors that it was sold at an auction in California and burned in a fire. She suspects that the mural remains somewhere in Ossining.</p>
        <p>''They've been highly sought after,'' Ms. Arminio said. ''People ask, whatever happened to them? It's a mystery. Whoever has them isn't fessing up.''</p>
