        <p>Q. I own shares in a co-op on the Upper West Side. In the annual election for the board of directors, how can shareholders be assured of a fair and impartial counting of the ballots? Isn't it a conflict of interest for the management company hired by the board to be allowed to count the votes? Why can't an outside company be used? Faye Coburn, Manhattan</p>
        <p>A. Ken Amorello, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that the governing documents of most co-ops and condominiums do not prohibit the hiring of outside companies to conduct elections. ''But doing this can be quite expensive,'' he said, ''so most small and midsize cooperatives tend to manage their own annual elections.''</p>

        <p>Q. I own shares in a co-op on the Upper West Side. In the annual election for the board of directors, how can shareholders be assured of a fair and impartial counting of the ballots? Isn't it a conflict of interest for the management company hired by the board to be allowed to count the votes? Why can't an outside company be used? Faye Coburn, Manhattan</p>
        <p>A. Ken Amorello, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that the governing documents of most co-ops and condominiums do not prohibit the hiring of outside companies to conduct elections. ''But doing this can be quite expensive,'' he said, ''so most small and midsize cooperatives tend to manage their own annual elections.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Amorello noted that acting fairly and above-board in conducting the election and vote count will help the managing agent maintain credibility with any new board that is elected.</p>
        <p>''If credibility is not maintained, the managing agent is likely to be replaced,'' he said. ''And every managing agent wants to maintain a long-term relationship with a building, regardless of who is on the board.''</p>
        <p>How to Send Information To Fellow Condo Owners</p>
        <p>Q. I am an owner of a condominium apartment. Some of us owners would like to propose some new candidates to run for the board. We would like to introduce our candidates to the other owners, but the current board has refused to provide us with a list.</p>
        <p>Can the board do this, and if so, is there any other way we can reach out to fellow owners, particularly the ones who are renting out their apartments?  Dieter Hoeppli, Manhattan</p>
        <p>A. ''Generally, a decision by the board of managers of a condominium will be deemed valid as long as it doesn't violate the law or the provisions of the condominium's governing documents,'' said Eric Gonchar, a Manhattan lawyer. ''And while it is unlikely that those documents specifically address this issue, a refusal by the board to provide information about unit owners as a means of protecting their privacy would probably be upheld.''</p>
        <p>But there are ways for owners to reach other owners, Mr. Gonchar said.</p>
        <p>One would be to slip fliers under the doors of every apartment in the building, asking renters to forward the information to the owner.</p>
        <p>Another would be to use the city's Automated City Register Information System. This system, known as Acris, contains a database of property owners that can be searched using the property address.</p>
        <p>The online link is www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/jump/acris.shtml.</p>
