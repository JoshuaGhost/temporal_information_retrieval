        <p>The formal part of the classical music season ended -- just moments ago, it seems -- and the festivals are under way. At CARAMOOR the violinist JOSHUA BELL is the opening-night draw. He performs the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto -- a work suited to his sweet tone and shapely approach to phrasing -- with the ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S, led by PETER OUNDJIAN. The program includes the Overture to ''Pope Joan,'' a 1998 work by JOHN MUSTO, the festival's composer in residence, and the Beethoven Eighth Symphony. Saturday at 8:30 p.m., Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252; $40 to $92.50.</p>
        <p>If a single work isn't enough Beethoven for you, the annual FRIENDS OF THE ARTS BEETHOVEN FESTIVAL on Sunday at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, N.Y., should offer ample satisfaction, and perhaps some frustration as well. Between noon and 4:30 p.m., for example, you might find yourself shuttling between Coe Hall, where EDWARD ARRON, the cellist, and JEEWON PARK, the pianist, play all of Beethoven's Cello Sonatas, and the Horticultural Center, where members of the Knights Ensemble begin an afternoon of chamber works with the ''Ghost'' Trio and the Quintet for Piano and Winds. The seven-hour festival includes an orchestral concert, at 5, in which the pianist JEROME ROSE will be the soloist in the Concerto No. 3, and the KNIGHTS ENSEMBLE, led by ERIC JACOBSEN, plays the Fourth Symphony. (516) 922-0061; $40 for the full day, $25 for the orchestral concert.</p>
        <p>The CONNECTICUT EARLY MUSIC FESTIVAL, under way since the beginning of the month, offers several inviting programs this week, including a performance of Spanish and Portuguese works by the vibrant young wind ensemble PIFFARO. Saturday at 8 p.m., Evans Hall, Connecticut College, New London, (860) 444-2419; $20 and $26.</p>
