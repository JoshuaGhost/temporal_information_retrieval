        <p>General managers, team presidents and other senior executives for the Knicks, the Liberty and the Rangers keep two offices: one at Madison Square Garden and the other at the Madison Square Garden Training Center in Greenburgh. In 2004, Madison Square Garden applied for permission to build a heliport on the grounds of the training center, to ferry officials back and forth quickly.</p>
        <p>Now the Greenburgh Town Board will meet on Tuesday to review a recommendation of the Town Planning Board to approve the heliport. The Town Board will then vote on it at a later date.</p>
        <p>Not every Greenburgh resident is thrilled with the idea of the heliport, including several who have called Paul J. Feiner, the town supervisor, since the application was filed.</p>
        <p>''I had an e-mail yesterday from somebody who was against it,'' Mr. Feiner said. ''I think people have some concerns about noise, about quality-of-life issues.''</p>
        <p>A heliport across the street from the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla has not attracted noise complaints from residents, even though the helicopters fly over Greenburgh, Mr. Feiner said.</p>
        <p>''I haven't made up my mind,'' Mr. Feiner said. ''But I think that members of the board are open-minded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiner said that after two years of waiting, Madison Square Garden began to press the issue only recently.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Madison Square Garden said the company hoped the heliport would be approved, particularly because company officials had offered its use to the state and local police.</p>
        <p>''We've been following the process all along, and we wanted to make sure that when we did it, we did it in an acceptable way,'' said Barry Watkins, senior vice president of communications for Madison Square Garden. ''We received a very positive recommendation from the planning board, so we felt the time we put into it was well spent.''</p>
