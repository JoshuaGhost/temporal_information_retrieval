        <p>To the Editor: In ''Nice; Going Straight To the Source for Provençal Cuisine'' (Choice Tables, June 4) I savored Mark Bittman's short list of some of the city's wonderful dining choices. I would add to the minimalist's list both a ''maxi'' and a ''mini.''</p>
        <p>For the ''maxi,'' I would suggest a restaurant called Chantecler at the Hotel Negresco, which has one Michelin star. For lunch, it offers ''Le Menu Plaisir'' with unlimited wine for about $70; dishes like carpaccio de gambas, pâté pressée with cèpes, saumon mi-doux au feu de bois, and quince tarte with Granny Smith ice cream represent some of the choices. Our meal included unlimited white wine (Côtes de Provence) and red wine of the Vaucluse region.</p>

        <p>For the ''mini,'' nothing compares to La Merenda, on Rue de la Terrasse. The former Chantecler chef Dominique Le Stanc has no phone, and reservations are made in person for his 24-seat restaurant; representative dishes include tarte de tomate, beignets de courgettes, pâte verte and stewed figs with fromage blanc and Côtes de Provence rosé. Culinary heaven in Provence.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: If you wanted to get a real taste of the area, you should have tried a pan bagnat. This sandwich is stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, olives, tuna, and anchovies, sprinkled with olive oil and sometimes balsamic vinegar. It's a simple and healthy treat that you can buy almost anywhere in Nice.</p>
