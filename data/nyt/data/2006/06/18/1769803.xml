        <p>DAIRY QUEEN</p>
        <p>By Catherine Gilbert Murdock.</p>
        <p>275 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $16.</p>
        <p>(Ages 12 and up)</p>
        <p>PEOPLE might feel sorry for D.J., a Wisconsin farm girl from a poor family. Her dad has a bad hip, so she has to work single-handedly all summer milking, haying and shoveling manure. But the 15-year-old narrator makes it clear she isn't going to wallow in self-pity.</p>
        <p>The only thing that really gets D.J. down is when the quarterback from her high school's rival team tells her she's like a cow -- passively doing what she's told, without stopping to wonder why. That prompts the crisis that leads to D.J.'s epiphany: she's got to stop being a cow and do what she really wants to do -- go out for the high school football team.</p>
        <p>It's hard not to believe that Murdock has spent a lot of time in Wisconsin (the book jacket says she grew up on a farm in Connecticut), because so much of what she describes is dead-on. D.J. talks just like small-town Wisconsin girls I know, with her encyclopedic knowledge of football, and funny, straight-shooting style. The hilarious descriptions of D.J.'s family are a tonic for adolescent angst. Her dad drives her crazy, but he also makes her -- and the reader -- laugh.</p>
        <p>The sports scenes are lyrical. ''I looked up, right at the perfect moment, and there was the football coming down. And I put out my hands and caught it like the raw egg at an egg toss, caught it like a little baby, and tucked it under my arm, and then because I was feeling so good I just kept running. . . . Like life . . . every once in a while came together and was just perfect.''</p>
        <p>D.J. is matter-of-fact about the inevitable controversy provoked by a girl going out for football, ''like the whole locker room thing,'' which she dispatches with characteristic dryness. ''Any guy who wanted a glimpse of me in a sports bra, well, that's a guy who needs to spend a lot more time online.'' For the most part, the guys take D.J.'s football prowess in stride. (It doesn't hurt that her older brothers are legendary players.) They stick up for her when other teams sneer. When they are jerks, D.J. shrugs it off.</p>
        <p>''Dairy Queen,'' the author's first novel, is a celebration of the kind of girl who, a generation ago, wasn't supposed to exist. It's a celebration of strength. Not the long-suffering, self-sacrificing kind, but the full-throttle, athletic kind. The book is a breath of fresh air among bookshelves crammed with young adult novels featuring mean girls obsessed with looks, designer labels and claustrophobic high school hierarchy. Not that those problems don't sometimes afflict our heroine, too.</p>
        <p>D.J. struggles, believably, with the feeling that she could never date that quarterback, whom she coaches over the summer, eventually falling in love. Her best friend tells her, cruelly, that she's out of her league.</p>
        <p>'' 'For your information, guys like that don't go out with girls like you.'</p>
        <p>'I know that,' I said, trying not to get mad. . . .</p>
        <p>'Now that I think about it, he probably would do it with you. But he'd tell everyone about it afterward, and they'd all laugh whenever they saw you.' ''</p>
        <p>D.J. overcomes that awful idea as she finds the freedom to express her athletic talent. And that, too, is believable. Thanks to Title IX, a whole generation of boys and girls is growing up playing sports together, and seeing themselves, and one another, in a whole new way.</p>
        <p>Murdock captures that hopeful phenomenon beautifully in her delightful novel.</p>
