        <p>KEEPING growing children geared up can be a pricey predicament, requiring parents to buy new athletic equipment frequently or to choose oversize items. Many customers buy the biggest bike possible for their child, hoping to eke out a second season, said Jon Minor, the bicycle products manager for Trek Bikes of Waterloo, Wis. ''But that can be dangerous and cause children to struggle getting on and off, or fall.'' To ease this quandary, Trek, like a handful other athletic companies, has developed products that grow with children.</p>
        <p>Though gear that easily expands is popular among pennywise parents, the equipment makes up a small part of the market, retailers say. ''The growth feature has been around for over five years, but unfortunately only a few manufacturers are utilizing it,'' said David Hill, the owner of Kid's Sportsworld, a 14-year-old sporting goods chain in St. Louis that caters exclusively to the 10-and-under crowd.</p>
