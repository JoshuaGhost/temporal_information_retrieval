        <p>He is the last person at the World Cup anyone would dare call a softie, but a fissure did appear in Oleg Blokhin's hard exterior Monday night. The manager of the durable Ukrainian team was so overwhelmed by the pressure of watching his team go into a penalty-kick shootout against Switzerland that he retreated to the locker room.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Blokhin was back, a colleague holding him delicately by the elbow, absorbing Ukraine's victory in the shootout -- despite a miss by its best player, Andriy Shevchenko -- and its advance to the quarterfinals, where it faces Italy on Friday.</p>
        <p>By Wednesday afternoon, Blokhin's stoicism was restored, leavened with deadpan self-deprecation.</p>
        <p>''The pressure was very bad, and I couldn't help the team when I stayed out on the pitch,'' Blokhin said. ''But that doesn't mean it brings a bit of luck for me to leave.''</p>
        <p>Ukraine is participating in the World Cup for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, which perhaps produced no greater player than Blokhin. With the letters C.C.C.P. emblazoned on his bright-red jersey, he scored 42 goals in 112 international appearances during the 1970's and the 1980's.</p>
        <p>He is respected at home, despite his racist comments about African players competing in Europe. Earlier this year, talking about the development of Ukrainian players, Blokhin told reporters: ''The more Ukrainians that play in the national league the more examples for the young generation. Let them learn from Shevchenko or Blokhin and not from some Zumba-Bumba whom they took off a tree, gave him two bananas and now he plays in the Ukrainian league.''</p>
        <p>Blokhin is a former Communist Party member and now a member of the Ukrainian Parliament who is not paid for his coaching duties because of a law that prevents Ukrainians from drawing government salaries for more than one job. Blokhin briefly resigned as coach last year after parliament members complained he could not effectively perform both jobs, but he returned after a public outcry. On Friday night, Blokhin will watch on the sideline as Shevchenko tries to penetrate Italy's formidable defenses and challenge Blokhin's claim to the title of the best striker to come out of Dynamo Kiev, Ukraine's pre-eminent soccer team.</p>
        <p>Those glory days came up this week, when German newspapers referred to Blokhin as the General. ''When I was with Dynamo Kiev, I was called the Major, so I don't know what I did to get this new rank,'' Blokhin said.</p>
        <p>Shevchenko, who is sometimes called the Eastern wind, will be playing against men he has come to know in his seven years of brilliant success in Italy. At any given point on Friday, he could find himself jostling against as many as four of his former A.C. Milan teammates.</p>
        <p>Shevchenko was sold to Chelsea of England for a $55 million transfer fee in May, in time to escape the match-fixing scandal that is churning the Italian league. He said he felt sorry for his old friends on the Italian team, many of them facing the prospect of seeing their teams relegated for the coming season.</p>
        <p>''It might influence the players before and after the game, but during the game, players are only thinking about the match, only focused on football,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Ukrainians are easily the least heralded of the eight teams remaining in the tournament, pegged at No. 42 in FIFA's somewhat imperfect rankings before the World Cup.</p>
        <p>But the Ukrainian team is enjoying its enhanced status, and is starting to abandon its secretive ways. On Wednesday, Blokhin allowed the news media to observe an entire training session in Potsdam.</p>
        <p>A number of die-hard fans infiltrated the stadium, and a barrel-chested member of the team's security detail took posters and magazines from their outstretched hands and returned them across the barriers with autographs.</p>
        <p>On the grass, the Ukrainians headed soccer balls back and forth over a volleyball net. With their gangly limbs and long hair, it seemed as if the outsiders from a local high school were on the field -- the rockers, or the audio-visual club.</p>
        <p>''The mood is quite brave, and we have recuperated after our long match against Switzerland,'' midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk said. ''Obviously, we've been watching all the Italy games, and clearly, Ukraine does have a chance against Italy.''</p>
        <p>Blokhin echoed those feelings the day before the match. ''I understand we're not Argentina or Brazil or one of these teams,'' he said. ''But we made the quarterfinal.''</p>
        <p>The team has invited Ukraine's president, Viktor A. Yushchenko, to attend the game. The president's news media office said that Yushchenko, who overcame dioxin poisoning to take office in 2004, might attend the match.</p>
        <p>If Yushchenko misses the game, Blokhin said there might be another chance.</p>
        <p>''I understand that Italy is the favorite,'' he said. ''But there are two teams on the field, and we've developed an appetite.''</p>
        <p>JUVENTUS HIRES FRENCHMAN -- Juventus, Italy's most prestigious club, which has been embroiled in a match-fixing scandal, appointed Jean-Claude Blanc of France as its general manager after the resignation of Luciano Moggi and an apparent suicide attempt by Gianluca Pessotto. Blanc was the head of the French Tennis Federation.</p>
