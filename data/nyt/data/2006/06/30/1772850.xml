        <p>The City Council approved a $52.9 billion budget at 12:40 a.m. today, the last day of the fiscal year. The budget was $235.8 million greater than the one proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on May 4. Lawmakers and lobbyists thronged City Hall around 11 last night as Council staff members began distributing hundreds of pages of documents detailing appropriations. Among the biggest adjustments disclosed last night were $14.2 million in operating aid for cultural groups and $4.6 million for meals at homes for the elderly. The budget also contains money for hundreds of pet projects, including $7.7 million in discretionary funds that Council members distribute to community groups, and for hundreds of religious, charitable and ethnic organizations.</p>
