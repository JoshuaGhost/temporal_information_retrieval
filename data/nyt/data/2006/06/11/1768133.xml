        <p>Tim Russert letter says Deborah Solomon's May 14 interview with him was selectively edited to make it appear that he chose to talk about his father rather than about his mother on Mother's Day</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The portrayal of my interview with Deborah Solomon (May 14) was misleading, callous and hurtful. I spoke with Deborah Solomon for more than one hour for what she described as a Mother's Day feature. We spent much of that time talking about my mom. I told her how my mom insisted her four kids sit at the kitchen table doing our homework while she prepared supper. We couldn't trade our pencil for a fork until she had corrected our work. Her lessons of discipline, accountability and preparation were invaluable training for my job as a journalist. I told her of Mom's joy at hearing our parish priest say, ''The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world'' because it affirmed the reality in our family -- that I was truly blessed to have a strong mother and strong father. I told her how my mom would wake me with a soft ''Tim, Tim.'' To me this proved you could be heard without yelling, something I hope is reflected each Sunday on ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>I told Solomon the details of my mom's final hours last August when she died from cancer. All four children were at her bedside. I told Solomon that my mom was a beautiful person, inside and out.</p>
        <p>Solomon chose to ignore all this, and instead the interview was selectively edited -- an interview entitled ''All About My Father,'' implying I chose to talk about my dad rather than my mom on Mother's Day. She also combined questions in her piece, suggesting I did not offer separate and distinct responses to each of her questions, which, of course, I did.</p>
        <p>My mom was a central figure in my life. This was my first Mother's Day without her. Your writer's deliberate mischaracterization of our conversation and her feeble attempt at humor made it a particularly painful day.</p>
