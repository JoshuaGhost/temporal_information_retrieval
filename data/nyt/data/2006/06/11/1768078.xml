        <p>I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER</p>
        <p>By E. Lynn Harris.</p>
        <p>296 pp. Doubleday. $21.95.</p>
        <p>Over the past 15 years, E. Lynn Harris has journeyed from humble beginnings -- self-publishing his first novel and hustling it himself at beauty shops and sorority houses -- to become one of the most popular black male novelists in America. A gay author addressing gay themes, Harris has helped bring taboo topics -- like closeted black men indulging their sexuality ''on the down low'' -- into mainstream conversation. Profiled in Entertainment Weekly, he described his readership as ''a little bit of everything. It's probably 60 percent African-American women, 20 percent gay and 20 percent other.'' What happens when a novelist becomes so aware of his audience? Is there a price to pay for such success?</p>
        <p>Harris's first book, ''Invisible Life'' (1991), was cleaner and more confident than many first novels. The story of a young Manhattan lawyer reckoning with his sexuality, it was smoothly paced, and the prose occasionally opened up on Fitzgerald-lite moments of sparkling sentiment. ''Invisible Life'' established Harris's central themes and schemes: There are two types of gay brothers -- those who have, approximately, the musculature of N.F.L. backfielders and tend to live on the D.L., and their out, proud, ''sissy'' little friends. There is a passion for specifying skin tone, an infatuation with status details and a limitless ardor for mechanical sex scenes. These are damaging but not fatal, except at those points where all three intersect: ''As my pants fell to the blond hardwood floor, landing around my ankles, I could see my black Jockey underwear against my camel-colored skin and felt relieved.'' The book also introduced a minor character who returns to strut through the Harris oeuvre -- Basil Henderson, a bisexual wide receiver. Is this the appropriate place to mention that, according to his Web site, the author's major extraliterary interest is working with cheerleaders?</p>
        <p>With time, Harris's tastes for sensation and luxury goods ripened. ''And This Too Shall Pass'' (1997) was a sophisticated romance novel involving a sportswriter (''Sean was relieved that fall and football were approaching''), a predatory TV newswoman (''She had on a burgundy handmade silk brassiere with matching panties'') and a pro quarterback (''Zurich Robinson's pumpernickel-brown face was a shower of sweat''), and Harris enriched the soap-opera drama by giving attention to small-scale emotional realities. His eighth novel, ''A Love of My Own'' (2002), found him making less time for the reality stuff, but it went in for zillionaire bling with zest and got its Midtown restaurants right. Little of it would embarrass Danielle Steel.</p>
        <p>The same cannot be said of ''I Say a Little Prayer,'' which stands as evidence that the cost to Harris of his prominence has been the near-complete betrayal of his talent. The hero, Chauncey Greer, is a 38-year-old greeting card entrepreneur living in upper-middle-class Atlanta. ''I wanted cards that showed handsome men, not pretty-boy model types, and I wanted messages I could relate to,'' Chauncey says of his Cute Boy Card Company. Years ago, a lover -- a member of the same successful singing group he was once in -- betrayed and wounded Chauncey; now, disillusioned about love, he's got a rule that he'll hit the 300-thread-count sheets of his king-size sleigh bed no more than three times with any one man.</p>
        <p>You can imagine Chauncey's feelings, then, when he discovers that his old love has grown up to become Bishop Damien Upchurch, a Denver-based family-values type campaigning against gay marriage and for a United States Senate seat. Scrolling incredulously through Upchurch's Web site, Chauncey sees that the candidate has scrubbed his biography clean of any mention of his impoverished childhood and old music career.</p>
        <p>Flipping incredulously through Harris's book, the reader sees that the novelist has ceased to care what he's typing: this group is supposed to have had ''a No. 1 R &amp; B hit and a multiplatinum album,'' and the fact that an upstart black conservative was a member of it zooms beneath the radar of a race-obsessed, entertainment-drunk republic? The notion is almost as far-fetched as the idea that a politician would ever play down a triumph over adversity.</p>
        <p>Despite feeble hints that it has something to say about gay rights or the culture of megachurches, ''I Say a Little Prayer'' is mostly about food. When Harris isn't digging through the pantry to work out someone's ''chocolate brown'' or ''croissant brown'' or ''butterscotch'' skin -- distinctions that can actually mean something socially in the South, as consumers of Spike Lee's ''School Daze'' and Tom Wolfe's ''Man in Full'' know -- he is itemizing the dietary habits of Atlanta buppies: A Starbucks caramel macchiato is a great afternoon pick-me-up. The Ritz-Carlton Buckhead is a fun brunchtime splurge. The Cheesecake Factory gets crazy busy on Friday nights.</p>
        <p>In the past, Harris has done a half-decent job of demonstrating the difference, say, between an AKA and a Delta on sorority row. Here, the author -- unaware? on cruise control? hesitant to give offense? -- doesn't process any of this data, so his skin games and Zagat-surfing go nowhere. The effect is of John O'Hara, a famously clueless brand-name-dropper, getting updated as smooth jazz. Or perhaps of a Cute Boy Card -- something with handsome men and a message everyone can relate to, which of course is tantamount to no message at all.</p>
