        <p>Turkey Hill was just another road in Westport, Conn., when Martha Stewart moved there. As her business grew from home-based catering into an empire, the road evoked a certain kind of life; it even became the name of one of Ms. Stewart's furniture collections. Now, the old farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road, and all that it entails, is for sale.</p>
        <p>The four-acre property, with its three-bedroom house built by an onion farmer in 1805, is listed at nearly $9 million. Ms. Stewart and her former husband, Andrew Stewart, bought the property for $80,750 in two parcels in the 1970's.</p>

        <p>Turkey Hill was just another road in Westport, Conn., when Martha Stewart moved there. As her business grew from home-based catering into an empire, the road evoked a certain kind of life; it even became the name of one of Ms. Stewart's furniture collections. Now, the old farmhouse on Turkey Hill Road, and all that it entails, is for sale.</p>
        <p>The four-acre property, with its three-bedroom house built by an onion farmer in 1805, is listed at nearly $9 million. Ms. Stewart and her former husband, Andrew Stewart, bought the property for $80,750 in two parcels in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>There are two greenhouses, a carriage house for guests, a ''party barn'' with a sleeping loft and a large square Japanese soaking tub, and a heated outdoor swimming pool. Ms. Stewart's gardens, with many varieties of fruit trees, rose-covered arches and ''glorious peonies'' are also included, said Susan Warburg, the listing broker. Ms. Stewart's home decorations are also part of the package, including the parlor floor with a dark green pattern that Ms. Stewart stenciled herself, Ms. Warburg said.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Westport no longer held any special charm for Ms. Stewart, who moved to Katonah, N.Y. She said so herself in an essay published in The New York Times Magazine in 2000, lamenting what she called an ''increasingly unfriendly neighborhood atmosphere'' and complaining about town regulations that hindered her business. In the essay, she vowed to leave.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Stewart released a statement that said, ''I am so sad to be leaving this property, which has meant so much to me and my family.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Warburg said people who want to view the property need to provide a letter from their lawyer or financial adviser indicating that they can afford the property.</p>
        <p>''As you can imagine, there are a lot of people who would like to see the property who aren't really interested in buying it or aren't financially able,'' Ms. Warburg said. ''We have to do something to make it reasonable.''</p>
