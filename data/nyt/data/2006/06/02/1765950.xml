        <p>West Caicos Reserve</p>
        <p>WHAT -- Island-wide development with a hotel and residences.</p>
        <p>WHERE -- West Caicos Island, Turks and Caicos.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES -- Among others, a full-service marina, diving, horseback riding, hiking, tennis and a beach club.</p>
        <p>PRICES -- Two- and three-bedroom villa units in buildings surrounding the hotel start at $2.5 million; other residential options -- all waterfront -- include town houses and stand-alone houses, and start at $3 million.</p>
        <p>STATUS -- The marina, hotel and about 30 units are expected to be completed in early 2008; other residences will be built by mid- to late 2009.</p>
        <p>DEVELOPER -- Logwood Hotel Development Company.</p>
        <p>CONTACT -- 649-941-7480 or www.westcaicosreserve.com.</p>
        <p>DETAILS -- West Caicos, an 11-square mile island in the British West Indies at the western end of the Turks and Caicos archipelago, has been uninhabited since the late 19th century, when salt production and farming ended there. Now it is being remade as a resort and residential development. A 125-suite Ritz-Carlton hotel with restaurants and a full-service spa will be built on the northern coast, surrounded by 75 villa units, whose residents will have access to the hotel's amenities. Nearby, a full-service marina capable of accommodating mega-yachts will feature town houses and a village with shops and restaurants. Ferries from a private dock near the airport in Providenciales will provide transportation to the island. About 90 percent of West Caicos, including the 500-acre Lake Catherine, a breeding ground for pink flamingos, will be untouched.</p>
        <p>Snake River Sporting Club</p>
        <p>WHAT -- Residential community emphasizing outdoor activities.</p>
        <p>WHERE -- Jackson, Wyo.</p>
        <p>AMENITIES -- A golf course, equestrian center, fishing and skiing, among others.</p>
        <p>PRICES -- Home sites, $1.25 million to $2.5 million.</p>
        <p>STATUS -- Home sites became available last fall; the golf course opens in July.</p>
        <p>DEVELOPER DPS -- Development Company.</p>
        <p>CONTACT -- 888-434-7772 or www.snakeriversportingclub.com.</p>
        <p>DETAILS -- On 554 acres bordering Bridger-Teton National Forest, this development is aimed at active second-home owners. It stretches six and a half miles along the Snake River and offers access to fly fishing as well as rafting. A golf course designed by Tom Weiskopf will have home sites lining seven of its 18 holes, and an equestrian center and a fitness complex with tennis and squash will also be available. In colder months, the club activities include cross-country and heli-skiing. A 23,000 square-foot lodge overlooking the golf course and the river will have a lounge, a restaurant and a pro shop. And there will be a full-service spa, which will use water from natural hot springs in its various treatments. When overall construction is completed in 2008, there will be around 130 home sites.</p>
