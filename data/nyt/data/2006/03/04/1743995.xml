      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Perhaps no one has the right to be more disappointed that Dubai is buying the storied British container port operator at the center of the political storm in the United States than the company it outbid, PSA International of Singapore.</p>
        <p>PSA has no port operations in the United States, so the Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the six American ports where it operates terminals would have been strong additions to the 19 others that PSA already has stakes in around the world. Peninsular &amp; Oriental's port operations in fast-growing China and India were also a draw.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the state-owned PSA would have vaulted to No. 1 from second in the top rankings of global port operators. And there would have been an historical twist: In 1845, Singapore moved its port from what is now its financial district to the southern coast just to serve Peninsular &amp; Oriental's coal-hungry steamships.</p>
        <p>Yet PSA, whose single shareholder is the Singapore government's $63 billion investment agency, chose to walk away after DP World topped its bid of £3.5 billion with one for £3.92 billion ($6.8 billion). That move demonstrated not only investment shrewdness on PSA's part, but also a fundamental aspect of the global ports business.</p>
        <p>''It's not about planting flags in as many places as you can,'' said Neil Davidson, container ports analyst for Drewry Shipping Consultants in London. ''It's about owning successful terminals in as many places as you can.''</p>
        <p>Failure in the battle for Peninsular &amp; Oriental presents PSA and its competitors with an uncomfortable new reality, analysts say. With the world's privately owned ports now dominated by four big players -- including Hutchison Port Holdings of Hong Kong and the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group of Denmark -- further growth in the port terminal empires will largely involve buying individual ports from governments, expanding existing terminals or building them from scratch.</p>
        <p>''It will be difficult for them to find a significant investment,'' said Yasmin Wirjawan, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's in Singapore. PSA declined requests for an interview.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for PSA, surging global trade is swelling its war chest for expansion. The company announced on Wednesday that net profits last year grew 20 percent to $653 million as cargo volumes jumped by nearly a quarter. Central to its growth is its home port in Singapore, where traffic grew last year to a record, equivalent to one-tenth of global container traffic.</p>
        <p>Until it was converted into a corporation in 1997, PSA was known as the Port of Singapore Authority, in charge of operating and regulating Singapore's terminals. Its fortunes, therefore, have long been synonymous with those of Singapore, which last year overtook Hong Kong as the world's busiest container port.</p>
        <p>With no natural resources, Singapore has relied on trade since the British declared it a free port in the early 19th century. Ideally situated at one end of the Strait of Malacca, Singapore grew into a hub for trade from Asia to Europe, first for spices from Indonesia and tea from China and now for high-technology goods from factories in China, Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
        <p>Exports from Singapore still amount to 150 percent of its gross domestic product. While Singapore is now a major manufacturing center itself, almost half of those shipments are products made elsewhere, consolidated into larger cargo, and then re-exported.</p>
        <p>Singapore's success as a trans-shipment hub has left it vulnerable to competition, but it has fended off that threat through efficiency. It has automated much of its operations; operators at its most advanced terminal handle up to six cranes remotely. And it sells its proprietary system for finding the most efficient way to load containers onto a vessel so they can be unloaded more quickly at their destination.</p>
        <p>But Singapore and PSA got a taste of what can go wrong in 2002, when Malaysia opened a rival container port less than 50 miles away, luring both the Maersk shipping line and Evergreen Marine of Taiwan with lower prices.</p>
        <p>PSA responded by laying off 14 percent of its work force and offering discounted prices. It even abandoned its longstanding resistance to allowing shipping companies to operate their own berths.</p>
        <p>''They've become more responsive to customers,'' said Lawrence Liaw, general manager at the Singapore office of the shipping line Nippon Yusen of Japan.</p>
        <p>The threat from Malaysia also lent new urgency to an effort to reduce PSA's reliance on its home port. PSA made its first overseas investment in 1996 when it bought a terminal in northern China. In 2002, it made its largest overseas investment, paying an undisclosed amount for an 80 percent stake in a new terminal in Antwerp, Belgium.</p>
        <p>Last year, PSA paid a reported $640 million for a minority stake in a terminal in Tianjin, China, and another $925 million for a share of the Hong Kong operations of its biggest rival in Asia, Hutchison Port Holdings.</p>
        <p>It also went head to head with oil-rich Dubai, losing a bid for the overseas ports of CSX World Terminals, but winning a stake in a port in Turkey.</p>
        <p>PSA now counts on overseas assets for roughly half its revenue. But the cost, financed entirely with cash and debt, has been high. Credit analysts warned that its plan to buy Peninsular &amp; Oriental could have hurt its overall financial stability.</p>
        <p>''It would have affected the flexibility of the whole company,'' said Esther Lee, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Now, analysts say, PSA will have to search for more bite-size additions. But new acquisitions will be increasingly expensive. While ports were selling for roughly $300 for a 20-foot equivalent unit -- the standard size of a single container -- prices have been rising to $500 and higher, according to Mr. Davidson at Drury, roughly what DP World paid for Peninsular &amp; Oriental's capacity.</p>
