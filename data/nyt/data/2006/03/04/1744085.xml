        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Stretched to Limit, Women Stall March to Work'' (front page, March 2):</p>
        <p>I wonder whether the balancing act required specifically of working mothers wouldn't be better studied, measured and reported using a broader concept like family management rather than household chores.</p>
        <p>Rote and routine chores like laundry, garbage, vacuuming and carpooling steal time away from both parents. But I would venture that the most challenging and harder to quantify family responsibilities borne by women are the planning, organizing, scheduling, coordinating, monitoring and adjusting that make the smooth flow of children's lives possible, particularly when their every minute must be accounted for to allow both parents to work.</p>
        <p>These are the ''thinking'' chores that you can't easily ask or pay others to do and that women, more than men, seem saddled with performing all hours of the day and night -- hours that I suspect aren't accurately reflected in the research statistics.</p>
