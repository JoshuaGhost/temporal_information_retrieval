        <p>Google's Stock Falls 7% After Disclosure That Technical Limits Restrict Its Growth  Google's shares tumbled 7 percent yesterday after the chief financial officer told investors that the company saw few additional advances in a technology that had brought it a substantial increase in advertising revenue. The financial executive, George Reyes, left, told an investor conference held by Merrill Lynch, that its revenue growth would slow as a result. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Supreme Court to Consider Business Tax Incentives  The Supreme Court takes up a major case today about the legality of tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks that states and local governments award businesses each year to build factories, or just to stay put. [C1.]</p>
        <p>JetBlue Tries to Revive Its Profit With Higher Fares  JetBlue Airways, the low-cost carrier, is trying to raise fares in a bid to restore profit after surging fuel prices caused it to lose $42.4 million in the fourth quarter. [C1.]</p>
        <p>The first 100 or so of thousands of small passenger jets will soon begin flying, the Federal Aviation Administration said, in what some proponents say, could alter the air-travel industry. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Restoration of Gulf Oil Production Remains Unfinished  The huge task of fixing the country's most important energy hub is far from over. Six months after Hurricane Katrina battered the gulf with 175-mile-an-hour winds and waves higher than eight-story buildings, more than a quarter of the region's oil output is still shut. [C1.]</p>
        <p>The Bush administration is scaling back on audits of energy companies that generate billions of dollars in sales from leases to produce oil and gas on federal property, state officials said. The changes have sparked protests from several oil-producing states and Indian tribes. [C1.]</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan Fills a Gap With a Fidelity Partnership  J. P Morgan announced a partnership with Fidelity Investment's brokerage arm that gives millions of individual investors access to the same new equity and fixed-income offerings its institutional clients have long received, filling a gap in the company's services. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Existing Home Sales at Two-Year Low in January  Sales of existing homes dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years in January and the number of unsold homes on the market rose, a trade group reported. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Apple Pushes Further Into Home Entertainment  Apple Computer furthered its push into home entertainment on the introduction of a high-fidelity stereo system for the iPod music player, as well as a new version of the Mac Mini computer with features for managing digital music and video. [C2.]</p>
        <p>CBS Radio Sues Howard Stern Over His Departure  CBS Radio filed a lawsuit yesterday against Howard Stern charging that its former radio star used his last months on the air at CBS to build up his future employer, Sirius Satellite Radio, and gained significant financial advantages that damaged CBS Radio. Mr. Stern countered that the lawsuit was an attempt by CBS to distract attention from its poor quarterly results. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Tumble on Mixed Economic Statistics  Mixed economic statistics caused stocks to tumble. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 104.14 points, to 10,993.41. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 13.46 points, to 1,280.66, and the Nasdaq fell 25.79 points, to 2,281.39. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Ports Takeover Opponents Raise New Objections  Lawmakers raised new objections to the proposed takeover of some terminal operations at six United States ports by a Dubai company. [A13.]</p>
        <p>A Former Enron Executive Testifies on Contracts  A former Enron executive gave the strongest testimony yet in a five-week-old trial that Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's former chief executive, signed off on a controversial accounting shift involving troubled trading contracts. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Technology Opens Opportunities for the Disabled  Thousands of people with disabilities are finding jobs and becoming independent as a result of technological advances like faster computers and broadband Internet connections that let them work at home. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Some Medicare Patients Find Themselves in Two Plans  Tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries have found themselves enrolled in two prescription drug plans at the same time as a result of confusion over the new program. [A1.]</p>
        <p>House to Vote on Pre-Empting States' Food Safety Rules  The House is expected to vote Thursday on a bill that would pre-empt state food safety regulations that are more stringent than federal standards and set a uniform set of rules across the nation. [A14.]</p>
