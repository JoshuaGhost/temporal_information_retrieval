        <p>HERE'S a message from the military home front: Our volunteers are tired and need hired help. While husbands (the United States military is 85 percent male) crisscross the ocean for second, third and even fourth tours in Iraq, military wives (the overwhelming majority of volunteers are wives) are burdened not only with running households, caring for children and holding down jobs, but also with assisting families of deployed soldiers.</p>
        <p>Almost 30 percent of all Army wives volunteer in a formal capacity. We run quality-of-life programs and serve on boards that take hours of dedication. We are the liaison between the commander and the soldiers' families, we refer people to various resources like the Red Cross and military-sponsored programs, we raise money to support family programs and in our informal roles, we are on call 24 hours a day to help families deal with divorce, child abuse, suicide and bereavement. Our work is expected, underappreciated and often goes unnoticed.</p>

        <p>HERE'S a message from the military home front: Our volunteers are tired and need hired help. While husbands (the United States military is 85 percent male) crisscross the ocean for second, third and even fourth tours in Iraq, military wives (the overwhelming majority of volunteers are wives) are burdened not only with running households, caring for children and holding down jobs, but also with assisting families of deployed soldiers.</p>
        <p>Almost 30 percent of all Army wives volunteer in a formal capacity. We run quality-of-life programs and serve on boards that take hours of dedication. We are the liaison between the commander and the soldiers' families, we refer people to various resources like the Red Cross and military-sponsored programs, we raise money to support family programs and in our informal roles, we are on call 24 hours a day to help families deal with divorce, child abuse, suicide and bereavement. Our work is expected, underappreciated and often goes unnoticed.</p>
        <p>We volunteers save the Department of Defense millions of dollars that would otherwise have to be spent on consultants, accountants, social workers, publicists, counselors, fundraisers, program managers, administrative assistants, advisers, class instructors and event coordinators.</p>
        <p>To give you an example of the magnitude of volunteer service, for fiscal year 2005, volunteers with various family programs that the Army offers logged 632,897 hours of service. Our service to the Army is valued at more than $11 million.</p>
        <p>But what happens when the most dedicated and experienced of military spouses say they are worn out?</p>
        <p>A friend of mine, a fellow Army wife and the mother of two small children, is the leader of the family readiness group of her husband's company. There are 60 soldiers in his relatively small company, but 51 of them are married. She is responsible for sustaining morale, cohesion and communication for 50 wives and their children, one husband and a handful of soldiers' parents. She leads meetings, manages and recruits other volunteers, holds fundraisers, updates rosters and passes on information from the command to families. Her husband has been deployed once to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan, where he is serving for a year. She's exhausted. ''I think that at times families forget that I am just a volunteer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, in the Army, if your volunteers are overwhelmed, you've got a big problem. Military recruitment and retention levels are directly linked to spouses, who are often the deciding factor in whether a soldier re-enlists or keeps a commission. If families are cared for and content, soldiers focus on their mission and are more likely to continue serving.</p>
        <p>Leaders know this. Since his appointment in November 2004, the Army secretary, Francis Harvey, has said his top priority is the well-being of soldiers and their families. He has reason to worry about it: in the 2005 fiscal year, the Army missed its recruitment goal for the first time in six years. The number of officers leaving the military is the highest it has been since Sept. 11, 2001. Last year, 8.6 percent of junior officers left the service; that's up from 6.3 percent in 2004. The attrition rate for majors rose to 7 percent in 2005 from 6.4 percent in 2004. And the rate of lieutenant colonels leaving the military is 13.7 percent -- the highest it's been in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>If the military wants to improve these numbers, they've got to accommodate families. Since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the military has expanded its counseling and family assistance programs, but it's now time to reduce the burden placed on volunteers. The Defense Department needs to set aside money in its budget to provide for more paid professional support. And at a minimum, every brigade (about 3,000 soldiers) needs at least one trained and paid family readiness group assistant to undertake administrative tasks like dealing with paperwork and mailings, making phone calls, maintaining phone rosters and updating address lists and organizing meetings.</p>
        <p>At larger military installations, a pilot program with paid family readiness group assistants that took the administrative burden off volunteers has been successful. The goal was to offer a program that standardized procedures, coordinated guidance and offered continuity for volunteer family readiness group leaders. But the jobs are only funded a year at time, and a consistent financing source is needed.</p>
        <p>The Army should also consider starting a community pilot program that pairs deployed brigades with civilian clubs, organizations, businesses and schools willing to donate time to fundraising, babysitting and otherwise supporting the brigades' full-time volunteers.</p>
        <p>And why not capitalize on the relationship between soldiers and chaplains by expanding and enhancing chaplaincy programs? A current program focuses on preventative marriage ''education'' rather than counseling when there's a problem. This preventative approach offers such things as weekend getaway retreats for young military couples. These retreats have been popular and successful, but they are expensive. More economical opportunities that can reach out to more couples are needed.</p>
        <p>''Family life consultants,'' who look for initial signs of stress and make referrals for formal counseling and treatment, are appearing on more Army installations. The number of these paid consultants, whose services are free and confidential, should be increased, and the program expanded to all posts, as well as to all deployed reserve units' home bases.</p>
        <p>The Army adapted how it fights wars in the 21st century. Now it's time to rethink its expectations of how it treats its volunteers. With each new deployment, the needs of military families evolve because each assignment is different and families may not have had enough time to recover from one deployment before the next one begins. It's not just soldiers who are worn down by repeated deployments -- spouses and children are affected too. If we are committed to our troops, then we need to make more of a commitment to their families.</p>
