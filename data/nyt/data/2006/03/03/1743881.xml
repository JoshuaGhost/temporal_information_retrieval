        <p>James Levine Recovering From Fall</p>
        <p>James Levine, right, fell off the stage during an ovation on Wednesday night at Symphony Hall in Boston, where he was conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra in a program that included Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. As a result, Mr. Levine, the orchestra's music director, was unable to conduct the same program last night. A statement from Mark Volpe, the managing director of the orchestra, said that ''a consultation with his doctors, and X-rays, have confirmed that there are no broken bones.'' But, it added, ''there is the understandable soreness and discomfort that typically result from a fall of this type. Mr. Levine very much hopes to return to the B.S.O. podium during the course of this weekend.'' Jens George Bachmann, assistant conductor, was tapped to take his place last night.</p>
        <p>Dave Chappelle to Comedy Central: Can the Laughs</p>
        <p>Dave Chappelle, left, has threatened not to return to Comedy Central if it proceeds with plans to broadcast four half-hour shows cobbled together from material he filmed before walking away from ''Chappelle's Show'' and a deal that could have earned him $50 million, The Associated Press reported. In a telephone interview with The Dayton Daily News, he said his return to the show was still possible. ''But I think if they air that stuff, I can't see how I'm going to be able to,'' said Mr. Chappelle, whose film ''Dave Chappelle's Block Party'' opens today (a review is on Page 1). In a written statement, Comedy Central did not comment on specific plans but said, ''We are still waiting patiently for Dave to return to work, but we know that our viewers are looking forward to seeing the material he produced for the third season.''</p>
        <p>Authors' Protest at Fair</p>
        <p>Writers including Nick Hornby, J. M. Coetzee, Mike Leigh, Nadine Gordimer, Will Self and Ian McEwan have called upon the organizer of the London Book Fair to end its association with international arms fairs, the BBC reported. The three-day fair, opening on Sunday, has been organized by Reed Exhibitions, a subsidiary of Reed Elsevier, the British-Dutch publishing giant. A letter signed by the authors published in The Times Literary Supplement and proffered by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, a coalition of peace groups and individuals, said, ''We are appalled that our trade should be commercially connected to one which exacerbates insecurity and repression, and which props up regimes inimical to free expression.'' Reed Exhibitions organized Europe's biggest arms fair in London last year. A spokesman said it ''utterly respects'' the writers' opinions.</p>
        <p>Peru to Sue Yale University Over Inca Artifacts</p>
        <p>Dissatisfied by a compromise proposal from Yale University, Peru's government said it plans to file a lawsuit in the United States seeking the return of hundreds of Inca artifacts, The Associated Press reported. Peru's ambassador to Washington, Eduardo Ferrero Costa, said that Yale had refused to acknowledge Peru's ownership of the artifacts, which were removed by a Yale archaeologist from the ancient city of Machu Picchu on digs in 1912 and 1914-15. He complained that the university ''proposes that these artifacts belong to humanity, and at the same time pretends to keep part of the collection.'' Yale said on Wednesday that it had offered to send some artifacts for display at a new museum in Peru while the rest would remain at the university. Many of the items, which range from human bones to ceramics, are on display at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>Backlash to Cartoon Fury</p>
        <p>The Indian-born British writer Salman Rushdie, below, the French philosopher Bernard-Henri LÃ©vy, the exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born filmmaker and member of the Dutch Parliament, are among a dozen signatories of a statement warning against Islamic ''totalitarianism,'' the BBC reported. The statement was published in Charlie Hebdo, a French weekly that was one of several European publications to reprint cartoons, first published in Denmark, that satirized the prophet Muhammad and ignited violent international protests. The manifesto published in Charlie Hebdo said, ''After having overcome fascism, Nazism and Stalinism, the world now faces a new global threat: Islamism.''</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Though an Off Broadway production of ''My Name Is Rachel Corrie'' was postponed this week because of concerns about its political content, the sold-out production at the Royal Court Theater in London will move to the West End. Pieced together from Ms. Corrie's journals and e-mail messages, the solo show by Alan Rickman, left, and Katherine Viner about Ms. Corrie, an American demonstrator killed by an Israeli bulldozer while trying to stop the destruction of a Palestinian home, will open at the Playhouse Theater for 36 performances, from March 28 through May 7.  The first New York revival of the 1954 Horton Foote play ''The Traveling Lady'' will open tonight at Ensemble Studio theater for a run through March 19. Presented in a new version, it deals with a young mother seeking a new life in a small Texas town and the return of the ex-convict husband who deserted her.</p>
