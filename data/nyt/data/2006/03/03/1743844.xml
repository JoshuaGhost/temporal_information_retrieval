        <p>Senate Votes to Renew Broad Antiterrorism Law  The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation renewing the sweeping antiterror law known as the USA Patriot Act, ending a months-long impasse on Capitol Hill and virtually guaranteeing that the measure will go to President Bush to be signed. The vote was 89 to 10.</p>
        <p>PAGE A14</p>
        <p>Senate Rejects Ethics Office  Senators backed away from expansive changes in lobbying law, overwhelmingly rejecting a proposal to create an independent office to investigate ethics abuses in Congress.</p>
        <p>PAGE A19</p>
        <p>Art for Art's Sake  The 2006 Whitney Biennial is long on collaboration: several shows under one roof, including works by Urs Fischer, below. It is also very much an insider's affair. A review by Michael Kimmelman.</p>
        <p>WEEKEND, PAGE E31</p>
        <p>Shiites Reclaim a Mosque  The mosque was built by Shiites, but given to Sunni worshipers under Saddam Hussein. Last week the Shiite militia arrived, and now it's named for a Shiite saint.</p>
        <p>PAGE A12</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart, Grocery Giant  Wal-Mart has become the largest grocer in the nation and with that size, it has growing leverage in the way products on its shelves are developed.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Fighting Malnutrition Early  A World Bank report says the problem of malnutrition for 100 million children must be addressed before the age 2.</p>
