        <p>Bode Miller says he has continued his practice of ignoring news media reports about him. But he cannot ignore the hate mail that was sent to his family in New Hampshire after his poor performances at the Olympics in Turin, Italy.</p>
        <p>''They were saying that, like, I'm a disgrace to my country and a disgrace to my team and my coaches,'' Miller said of the letter writers on Tuesday, the first time he spoke about the beating his public image had taken. ''And that I'm the most hated athlete in the history of the Olympics, and that I shouldn't be allowed to race the Olympics again if I wanted to.''</p>
        <p>There was indignation in his voice, but a twinkle in his eye suggested that hate mail was a small victory, confirming his oft-repeated argument that Olympic hysteria brings out the worst in people.</p>
        <p>Miller won no medals at the Olympics, despite competing in five events and coming in as the third-ranked Alpine skier in the world. He had moments of athletic brilliance but could not link them together to come up with a medal.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Miller was sprawled on the couch of a teammate's hotel room, eating potato chips, having just watched a few episodes of the sitcom ''Friends'' after a downhill training run before the final World Cup event of the season. A year ago this week, Miller became the first American to win the overall World Cup title in 22 years.</p>
        <p>This year, Benjamin Raich of Austria, a double gold medalist in Turin, has clinched that title. Miller is ranked sixth and his teammate Daron Rahlves seventh.</p>
        <p>But Miller seemed happy nonetheless to have returned to the World Cup circuit. It is a much more natural habitat for him than the Olympics, in which he competed grudgingly.</p>
        <p>After marching in the closing ceremony on Feb. 26 in Turin, Miller visited Paris with his sister, then vacationed in Florida. Finding blissful anonymity on the golf courses there, he skipped four World Cup races before returning here to close the season.</p>
        <p>At the Olympics, he jumped fences to get away from reporters; after Tuesday's training run, he climbed the fence and jumped into the middle of the media zone, chatting amiably with reporters for the better part of an hour. It was also a chance for him to address what appears to be his widening rift with the United States ski team.</p>
        <p>The team's coaches will not speak about Miller's future, on orders from team executives. At the end of the Olympics, Bill Marolt, the chief executive of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association, said he planned to have a ''heart to heart'' with Miller. Beyond that, Marolt said the terms of Miller's association with the program next season were an internal matter.</p>
        <p>''There's definitely a broad spectrum of possibilities,'' Miller said brightly, never one to stick to a script.</p>
        <p>He said he was confident that his coaches considered his results in Turin to be the product of bad luck, not an overactive night life. But he also said perceptions would have some power over his fate.</p>
        <p>''I can't see that they would use the Olympics as such a negative thing that I was kicked off the team,'' Miller said. ''Although with sponsorship stuff -- who knows -- they may have to do something like that to appease the public image, because they do rely so much on funding for that.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Miller suspects he will be allowed to stay with the team, and he genuinely seems to want to. He said he liked the team's coaches and gained motivation from training with his peers, like Ted Ligety, the 21-year-old who won the Olympic combined. Miller said Tuesday that the benefits of staying with the team outweighed the hassles of racing independently.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Miller is considering a more specialized approach to the World Cup next year, focusing on a few disciplines instead of all four. He is also mulling surgery on a lingering knee injury, which has bothered him all season.</p>
        <p>In the Olympic downhill, Miller was 11-hundredths of a second from a medal, and in the super-G he crashed after taking an overly aggressive approach. He won the downhill portion of the combined, but later that day caught a tip in the slalom portion, a chronic problem that also took him out in the regular slalom race.</p>
        <p>In the giant slalom, Miller hit a rock on the first run. His second run was one of the best of the day, but the combined two-run time was not good enough for the podium.</p>
        <p>For his fans, who are used to his frequent crashes, they were familiar sights. Miller won the overall title in 2005 despite failing to finish 11 of the 36 races.</p>
        <p>For mainstream America, it was an 0-for-5 record.</p>
