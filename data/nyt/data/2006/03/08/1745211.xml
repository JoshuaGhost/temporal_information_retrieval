        <p>After even a short walking tour of the new Emirates Palace hotel on the Abu Dhabi Corniche, a visitor might well start to wonder: is there anything here that glitters that is not, in fact, gold?</p>
        <p>From its golden flagpoles to its golden chandeliers to the golden finials on its rooftop domes and the gold-leafed mosaics on the columns in its lobby, the Emirates Palace literally glows with luxury. The hotel, owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, took more than three years and reportedly more than $3 billion to build, which would make it the most expensively constructed hotel in the world.</p>
        <p>For the last several years, Abu Dhabi, the largest among the seven princely city-states that make up the United Arab Emirates, has been working to raise its international profile. It has opened tax-free development zones to lure foreign investment, set up Etihad, its first airline, and founded a tourist board to entice recreational visitors. And with the opening of the Emirates Palace, with its 114 domes, 1,002 Swarovski crystal chandeliers, 12 restaurants, nearly a mile of private beach, and 3.9 million cubic feet of imported marble, Abu Dhabi has cemented its image as one of the most luxurious destinations on earth.</p>
        <p>The hotel's most modest rooms, each with several enormous plasma screen televisions and a personal butler, start at 2,900 Emirati dirhams a night, or about $773 at 3.75 dirhams to the dollar. A Palace Suite, on the other hand, heavily decorated with silks and gold and silver leaf, and including a living room, dining room and three bedrooms, can run as much as 42,000 dirhams, or $11,200, a night.</p>
        <p>"This is very useful when you're traveling with an entourage," said an Emirates Palace spokeswoman, Rumyanka Tzolova.</p>
        <p>Indeed.</p>
        <p>If, even with such room rates, the rumored $3 billion plus price tag still seems out of step with the hotel's expected returns, it is important to remember that the Emirates Palace wasn't conceived so much as a profit-making venture as a way to put Abu Dhabi on the map.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly, in the hotel's brochures, it is referred to as a "landmark" or a "palace" rather than a hotel. In prose that veers well toward purple, the Emirates Palace Web site welcomes visitors to "an enchanting landmark that's a wonder to behold for all who venture through its magnificent gates ... a majestic experience fit for a king and deserving of an emperor." And, in what seems to be a slap at the promotional claims of the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, which says it has seven stars, the frequently asked questions section notes that "the seven or six star ratings do not officially exist. ... We classify Emirates Palace as just that, a Palace."</p>
        <p>The path to the front of the Emirates Palace is not a straight shot; visitors enter through a formal garden flanked by pavilions designed like triumphal arches. The final approach to the hotel comes as a surprise. The path makes a seemingly gentle turn, and then, startlingly, the hotel looms before the visitor, the pink grainte main structure towering above a four-story outdoor staircase.</p>
        <p>"It's psychological," explained the general manager, Noel Massoud, a Jordanian. "When you come up to a building from beneath, you have the impression that it is even bigger."</p>
        <p>And suddenly, it's impossible to take it all in. There's a waterfall running down the center of the staircase in a fish-scale pattern, and vast wings of the building trail east and west toward helicopter pads, swimming pools and more gardens. On the roof, there's a profusion of domes: pointed domes and bulbous domes and domes covered with glittering tiles. There are domes with little skirts, like inverted lotus blossoms, domes that seem inspired by Mogul forts or by Russian basilicas, domes that resemble gargantuan Hershey's Kisses.</p>
        <p>On paper, the Emirates Palace sounds grand to the point of grandiosity, and almost grotesquely opulent. It is the kind of building you'd expect in a book or movie, but is disconcerting to be confronted with in real life. But with its yellowy golden glow and contented polyglot population, there's an exuberance about it all that is, well, fun.</p>
        <p>Inside, the place manages to feel warm and peopled. Confronted with such vast expanses of lobby and hallway, the visitor's sense of scale quickly recalibrates, so that an enclosed area the size of a football field actually feels intimate.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit, the Champagne and caviar bar in the lobby was nearly full, and the 13 international newspapers available to diners at Le Vendôme Brasserie were being read and passed around. At a Viennese-style cafe in the lobby there was a family of five speaking animatedly in Portuguese, next to a pair of fashionable young Emirati men, their ghutra headdresses crisply ironed and folded to create a widow's peak effect.</p>
        <p>The staff seemed uniformly friendly, well spoken and almost touchingly proud of their workplace. A man named Samy, a security guard from Egypt, confided that he felt overwhelmed at his luck in "working in a place that is so amazing."</p>
        <p>"Every day I am asking myself how come I get to work here," he said. "I have seen so many celebrities, like Gerhard Schröder, J. Lo and the Fulham Football Club."</p>
        <p>A waitress at the Havana Club cigar bar spontaneously offered a tour of the bar's marvels, including Cohiba cigars in a dramatically backlit storage case and a kind of Cognac called Hardy Perfection that costs 9,000 dirhams, or $2,400, a glass.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people have asked about it," she said, "but the seal is still on the bottle."</p>
