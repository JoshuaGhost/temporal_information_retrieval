        <p>David Horowitz letter on Francis Fukuyama's Feb 19 article on US foreign policy in light of failure of neoconservative experiment in Iraq</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I appreciate the fresh thinking Fukuyama has given to the disastrous, imperial outlook of the neoconservative movement, but why, oh why, did he have to identify the founders of the cause and others by their religion? He constantly refers to any figure as Jewish if he is so, while refraining to identify the religious affiliations of other figures in the movement. This is, in itself, a form of anti-Semitism, as if being Jewish were a racial trait rather than a religious selection. I hope Fukuyama, who is evidently on a campaign to reform the movement and send it in a new direction, learns to refrain from this old shibboleth as he strives in his new direction.</p>
