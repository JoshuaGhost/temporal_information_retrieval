        <p>Four years ago, the windows of Lenny Zizel's clothing store here in the heavily Portuguese Ironbound neighborhood were draped with campaign signs for Cory Booker, then a city councilman who went on to lose a brutal race for mayor against the incumbent, Sharpe James.</p>
        <p>This time around, only dresses hang behind the glass. Though another election is scheduled for May 9 and Mr. Booker is back on the campaign trail, Mr. Zizel has had enough. ''People here have to think twice after that movie,'' he said in a recent interview at the store on Ferry Street. ''I don't think I want to get involved.''</p>
        <p>That movie is ''Street Fight,'' the Oscar-nominated documentary of the 2002 mayor's race that shined a spotlight on Mr. James's bruising political machine while casting Mr. Booker as the idealistic underdog. Outside Newark, it's a hit; winning an Academy Award tonight for best documentary would cap a run that has included top awards at film festivals and lavish praise from commentators like Ellis Cose and prominent critics, including David Denby of The New Yorker.</p>
        <p>Yet here in New Jersey's largest city, where hard-fought campaigns are common and a third of the children grow up poor despite a boom in new housing construction, ''Street Fight'' has spawned mainly ambivalence. Influential ministers, along with merchants and local political scientists, said the success of the documentary -- directed by a Booker supporter named Marshall Curry -- had caught Newark by surprise.</p>
        <p>Some residents have responded with anger at what they consider an insulting portrait of their hometown, homegrown mayor and the voters who have elected him since 1986. Others, ashamed of the city's brass-knuckled political culture, are determined to demand from local leaders a more dignified sequel.</p>
        <p>''It clearly makes Newark look bad,'' said the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers' Council of New Jersey. ''One of the benefits is that because of that, the citizens are going to hold the candidates accountable this time in terms of how they conduct their campaigns.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker and Mr. James -- who has not officially announced his candidacy, though he has made moves suggesting he will run -- already seem to have gotten the message. Both are now treating the film like bird flu.</p>
        <p>Mr. James, now 70 and serving his fifth term, did not respond to requests for interviews about the movie. He has never been much of a fan. ''Street Fight'' captures him denying Mr. Booker access to public housing to campaign and implying that Mr. Booker's light-brown skin and Ivy-League background make him too white to lead a city of 280,000 that is 53 percent black and 30 percent Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The film also beats a drum about the city's poverty, glossing over the effects of the exodus of white middle-class residents and signs of improvement under the mayor's watch, including a recuperating downtown.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't much in-depth research, looking at the past, and no use of more than one lens,'' said Clement Price, a history professor at Rutgers University in Newark.</p>
        <p>After ''Street Fight'' was televised for the first time last summer on Channel 13, New York's PBS station, Mr. James sent a series of angry letters to the station denouncing its decision to display what he described as ''nothing more than free political advertising for Mr. Booker.''</p>
        <p>The mayor stressed repeatedly that Mr. Curry and his brother Ravenel Boykin Curry IV contributed more than $20,000 between them to Mr. Booker's campaigns since he first ran for the Newark city council in 1998. ''There was no balance or objectivity in the Curry operation,'' he wrote, adding that Mr. Booker ''is no Mother Teresa.''</p>
        <p>Marshall Curry, in an interview last week, acknowledged contributing to Mr. Booker's campaign, but he said that the money was irrelevant. ''The Booker people had nothing to do with creative control of the film,'' he said. ''It was my point of view, 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. James appears to realize the impact of the cameras he so vigorously shoved aside during the filming of ''Street Fight.'' His State of the City address last month included a 10-minute documentary tracing the city's history from the riots of 1967 through the present, and a video of his visit to a new Home Depot on Springfield Avenue. Both films are now prominently displayed on the city's Web site, www.ci.newark.nj.us.</p>
        <p>Rahaman Muhammad, president of the local service employees union, said that ''Street Fight'' had awakened city officials to the power of the moving image, beyond just 30-second commercials. He said he might even make videos of his own if he sees any campaign tearing down signs or limiting access to public events.</p>
        <p>''They were not clean last time, and they will not be clean this time,'' he said. ''Being clean is not what it's about; it's about winning.''</p>
        <p>Ron Rice Jr., a city council candidate for the West Ward on Mr. Booker's slate, welcomed the extra cameras. ''I encourage both sides to keep cameras in their cars and show what goes on,'' he said. ''It only makes the process more transparent.''</p>
        <p>But he said Newark needed to move beyond ''Street Fight.'' ''It's done,'' he said. ''We think it speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker's relationship to the film is more complicated. His advisers have acknowledged that ''Street Fight'' has been useful for fund-raising; he and his roster of candidates have already collected more than $4 million, about twice what Mr. James's team has raised.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Booker, 36, a Rhodes scholar with a law degree from Yale, has embraced the movie when it has been shown for private audiences. On Feb. 21, for example, he appeared at a screening in Manhattan with a red-carpet crowd that included Winona Ryder, Uma Thurman and Rosie Perez.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he has also repeatedly told reporters that this year's race ''is not Street Fight II.''</p>
        <p>''It's a truthful movie about an important piece of history in our city, but we're looking forward now,'' he said while canvassing for votes in the city's North Ward.</p>
        <p>He rarely mentions Mr. James by name in campaign speeches, and ''Street Fight'' has not yet appeared at a Newark movie theater.</p>
        <p>Ingrid Reed, a political science professor at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said Mr. Booker was walking a fine line between exploiting his role as the ''Street Fight'' leading man and avoiding a perception that he cares more about stardom than he does about local residents. Undecided voters in particular are not likely to be won over by a documentary about 2002, Ms. Reed added.</p>
        <p>''It's part of the challenge he faces,'' she said, referring to Mr. Booker, who lost the last election by about 3,500 votes. ''This is four years later, so what does he want to do now? Why should they vote for him now?''</p>
        <p>Local residents and business owners also seem hungry for change.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows it was a bad election last time,'' said Mr. Zizel, who spoke on the condition that the name of his store not be published because he is waiting for city approval on a handful of permits and fears that he could be punished for speaking out. ''That's not what people want.''</p>
