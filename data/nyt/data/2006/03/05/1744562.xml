        <p>The body of a newborn was discovered on a quiet Long Island street yesterday morning after being struck by several vehicles whose drivers were apparently unaware of what they were running over, the police said.</p>
        <p>The authorities had not found the child's mother as of last night, and local hospitals said the authorities had been checking for women who might have recently given birth.</p>
        <p>The body, whose sex and race had not been determined, was found just after 7:30 a.m. on by a man walking his dog on Sunset Drive near Dicks Lane , according to Lt. Dennis Farrell of the Nassau County Police Department homicide squad.</p>
        <p>The man originally thought the body was the remains of an animal that had been hit by vehicles after wandering into the street, Lieutenant Farrell said in a news release.</p>
        <p>''Preliminary investigation determined that the newborn baby had been struck by several vehicles, and had been in the roadway for sometime,'' the release said.</p>
        <p>Many questions remained late yesterday. It is unclear, for instance, how the newborn ended up in the street; whether the baby had died before or after its body was struck by vehicles; or how long the body had been in the street.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood where the body was found is residential, with Tudor-style houses. The Hempstead Golf and Country Club is on the opposite side of Sunset Drive.</p>
        <p>People who live nearby said they were unaware of what had happened until Nassau County police officers knocked on their doors yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>''I love living in this neighborhood -- it's quiet,'' said Kim Daniels, who said her two children walk the family's dogs each morning where the body was found. ''I'm very shocked.''</p>
        <p>Another neighbor who declined to give his name, said, ''This kind of thing doesn't happen here.''</p>
        <p>The body was taken to the county medical examiner's office for further examination, the authorities said.</p>
