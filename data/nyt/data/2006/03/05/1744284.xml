        <p>SUPPOSE you decide to spend the weekend upstate, looking forward to visiting a favorite bistro or tavern. When the server asks for your drink order, you'll most likely order a glass of wine or a mug of beer. Since holders of wine and beer permits are allowed to serve wine and beer that are up to 24 percent alcohol by volume (or what's known as 48 proof) and, oddly enough, the Korean distilled spirit soju, defined specifically as ''imported from Korea,'' your waiter can easily comply with your request. But if you wanted to order any other distilled spirit, for instance a local fruit brandy made from Hudson Valley apples grown in the orchard down the road, you'd be out of luck. You'd have to go to a bar or a restaurant with a much harder to obtain and costlier full liquor license.</p>
        <p>Two pieces of legislation, one sponsored by Senator Bill Larkin and the other by Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, are making their way through Albany. These bills finally eliminate the artificial distinction between the alcohol in distilled spirits like brandy and the alcohol in fermented products like wine. Their passage would permit licensees to serve any 100 percent New York State distillate that is 48 proof or lower.</p>

        <p>Two pieces of legislation, one sponsored by Senator Bill Larkin and the other by Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, are making their way through Albany. These bills finally eliminate the artificial distinction between the alcohol in distilled spirits like brandy and the alcohol in fermented products like wine. Their passage would permit licensees to serve any 100 percent New York State distillate that is 48 proof or lower.</p>
        <p>But the impact of this amendment to the Alcohol Beverage Control law would go well beyond the walls of your favorite cafe or tavern.</p>
        <p>In New York, small farms are besieged by foreign competition, government regulations and land developers with fat checks, and their combined effect is to encourage growers to give up one of the most dangerous and difficult jobs in America, farming.</p>
        <p>But one way to sustain small-scale farming is to find new, value-added uses for agricultural products and sell them to new markets. Each fall, for example, New York apple growers send the majority of their crop off to the cider mill at 6 cents a pound; but converted to apple brandy, their value would quadruple. A fingerling potato farmer in central New York might plow under 130,000 pounds of his crop annually; instead, those potatoes could be used to make vodka that sells for $25 to $35 a bottle. Wineries compost tons of grape pulp, or pomace; but pomace is also the raw material for the production of premium grappa. By allowing wine and beer licensees to sell these distilled products at 48 proof, the proposed amendment would create a significant new market for New York growers.</p>
        <p>The growing demand for locally produced goods and for high-quality (and equally high-priced) batch-distilled spirits is changing the business of alcohol production. Agricultural micro-distilleries are proliferating nationwide. One of their products is ''hard cider'' that is fortified with distilled spirits and typically served at or below 48 proof. One study financed by Michigan's Apple Commission and the federal Department of Agriculture estimated hard cider sales could capture 1 percent to 5 percent of the state's brewed beverage sales with a deliberate marketing effort, a market potentially worth up to $3 million a year.</p>
        <p>New York's 10 farm distilleries already make use of local produce and fruit, much of which is otherwise unacceptable for cosmetic reasons, or unfit because of storm damage and is fed to livestock, or treated as waste and plowed under. The amendment would create greater incentives for small distillers to produce fine low-proof spirits from raw materials produced by New York growers.</p>
        <p>Arguments that distilled spirits are different from fermented beverages are unfounded, since any two beverages with the same alcohol content have an identical effect upon the consumer. Cafes and taverns already serve wines up to 48 proof. Fermented beverages have a reputation for producing wicked hangovers, but skilled distillers are able to remove most of the undesirable elements that cause this problem.</p>
        <p>When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt argued against Prohibition, he highlighted the importance to agriculture of alcohol production, appointing his secretary of agriculture, Henry Wallace, to oversee a code for brewers and distributors upon repeal of the 18th Amendment. Roosevelt's position is equally valid today.</p>
        <p>The practical effect of the proposed amendment will be the creation of an enormous premium market for high quality, locally produced agricultural distillates made by small, farm-based distilleries from the produce of New York State farms, orchards and wineries. Passage of the amendment will not solve the problem of the shrinking number of small farms, but it will provide farmers with a new revenue stream, and a new premium market for their produce.</p>
