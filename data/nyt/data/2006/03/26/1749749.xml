        <p>With a name like Cozy, it's fitting that Cozy Friedman would become a symbol for the Manhattan stroller-pushing set. The owner of Cozy's Cuts for Kids, three popular uptown children's hair salons, Ms. Friedman provides legions of stylish Manhattan parents with that watershed moment: baby's first haircut.</p>
        <p>Managing her salons, her line of children's hair-care products (So Cozy) and two grade-school-age boys, ''my life has many layers,'' Ms. Friedman said. Her wardrobe does too.</p>

        <p>With a name like Cozy, it's fitting that Cozy Friedman would become a symbol for the Manhattan stroller-pushing set. The owner of Cozy's Cuts for Kids, three popular uptown children's hair salons, Ms. Friedman provides legions of stylish Manhattan parents with that watershed moment: baby's first haircut.</p>
        <p>Managing her salons, her line of children's hair-care products (So Cozy) and two grade-school-age boys, ''my life has many layers,'' Ms. Friedman said. Her wardrobe does too.</p>
        <p>''I leave early in the morning and come home late. On any given day I'll go running at 5:45 a.m., shower, go on a sales call, have a business lunch, pick up the kids from soccer and go out to dinner. So I dress for an entire day.''</p>
        <p>Here in the spirit of always being prepared Ms. Friedman, 40, wears a pair of Gold Sign jeans, which she prizes for being neither too high-waisted nor too low-waisted; a celery silk camisole by Gold Hawk; a hand-painted burgundy shrug by Flamingo Therapy; and Justin cowboy boots that give her comfort for day and height for night.</p>
        <p>''I like designers I've never heard of before,'' she said. ''I love finding offbeat stores. Tonight I'm going to dinner downtown, so I'll try to get there early and do a quick shop. You have to squeeze in a little shopping whenever you can.''</p>
