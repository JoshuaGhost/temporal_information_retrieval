        <p>When the Palestine Hotel opened in 1982, it was one of the grandest things Iraq had ever seen, at least in the last few thousand years since Babylon was built.</p>
        <p>It had acres of Italian marble, endless Persian carpets, a casino, a bowling alley, a spa and guests from around the world who would sit and chat and drink and dance in Aladdin's bar just off the lobby.</p>
        <p>Now, it is a ghost town.</p>
        <p>The hallways of Iraq's most famous hotel beg for footsteps. The shiny brass kettles in the gift shop wait for someone to pick them up. The tap at Aladdin's is dry.</p>
        <p>The other day at lunchtime, Takeharu Watai, a Japanese journalist, was the lone customer in the coffee shop.</p>
        <p>''How do you say,'' said Mr. Watai, searching for the right words in English, as six waiters with droopy bowties waited to clear his plate. ''Black hole?''</p>
        <p>Few places are more depressing than a deserted hotel past its prime. But the Palestine is not just any old hotel; it was one of the best-known landmarks in town. This was the place, after all, where journalists stood on the roof and filmed Saddam Hussein's palaces being bombed and his statue being trashed.</p>
        <p>After the invasion, the hotel turned into reconstruction central, swarming with contractors, engineers and investors. Even during the bloodiest days of the insurgency, the Palestine kept its guests safe and continued to prosper.</p>
        <p>But no more. The violence outside its gates finally crashed in, and now the Palestine joins the rest of Baghdad, struggling to survive and hoping for better days.</p>
        <p>The lobby is a mess, with wires dangling from the ceiling and glass crunching underfoot, the leftovers of a suicide attack last fall.</p>
        <p>Of the 420 rooms, fewer than 100 are occupied. Many of those will soon be vacant as more journalists retreat to rented medieval-style forts with huge walls and armed sentries.</p>
        <p>Gone too are the Arab businessmen who just a year ago breezed through the hallways in their dishdashas.</p>
        <p>Tourists?</p>
        <p>''We haven't seen one for years,'' said Taja Saleh, the night restaurant manager.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Saleh began working at the hotel in 1984, it was the biggest in Baghdad, 17 floors of five-star luxury, albeit with a special, Arab-mod feel. Picture globe lights, striped rugs, chandeliers that look as if they were made of kryptonite and lots of orange and brown.</p>
        <p>Even from miles away it was hard to miss, a golden tower peering down on a city of squat buildings.</p>
        <p>The hotel was part of the French-owned Meridien chain, and Ms. Saleh gaily remembered her old French friends, like Mademoiselle Dominique, in charge of housekeeping, and Monsieur Granier, the dapper manager.</p>
        <p>The mid-80's were Iraq's gravy days, when the country was flush with oil money. The Hotel Palestine Meridien, as it was called, was the place to get married, the place to have a meeting, the place to get a drink. (Lacking customers, it no longer serves alcohol.</p>
        <p>In 1988 or 1989 -- managers at the Palestine were not certain -- Le Meridien sold the hotel to a group of investors, with the Iraqi government taking a 51 percent stake.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Mr. Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait, setting off more than a decade of hardship.</p>
        <p>But the Palestine persevered.</p>
        <p>To evade penalties, it shipped in food by plane, said Ibrahim Rashid, the general manager.</p>
        <p>As American-led forces massed on Iraq's borders in 2003, journalists, aid workers, contractors and even bearded mujahedeen who flocked from across the Islamic world to join the fight massed in the Palestine's lobby. Sometimes, they all shared the elevator.</p>
        <p>It was here that Mr. Hussein's clownish spokesman gave his last clownish speeches, saying that the Americans had been vanquished, when in reality Baghdad was theirs.</p>
        <p>For journalists, every war has its hotel, and for many reporters and camera crews, the Palestine, with its jerky elevators and shipping container-shaped rooms, was home, office and nightclub during the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>Even a year after the invasion, the honeycombed balconies were still studded with satellite dishes. You needed wasta, or connections, to get a room. And with prices of $90 to $300 a night, cash please, the Palestine became an A.T.M. for its owners.</p>
        <p>But then things changed. A rash of kidnappings in Baghdad scared away foreigners. Reconstruction petered out. Violence rose, business and investment hit the skids and soon the hotel across the street, known as the Ishtar Sheraton, even though it has not been a Sheraton for years, cleared out.</p>
        <p>The coup de grâce was the suicide attack on Oct. 24, 2005. Three vehicle bombers, including one driving a cement mixer, blew up outside the hotel, killing more than a dozen guards and bystanders and shattering whatever sense of immunity the Palestine had left.</p>
        <p>Now, just a few brave foreigners remain, mostly journalists.</p>
        <p>''The place is definitely a little weird,'' said John Fiegener, bureau chief for Fox News, which rents an entire floor. ''But you've got to give it to the staff. They put on a smile every day and try their best.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of waiters, housekeepers, clerks and guards are still employed, surviving off the last vapors of yesteryear's prosperity. It is not clear how much longer they can hang on.</p>
        <p>That same subtle whiff of doom lingering in the streets now lingers in the lobby, where the staff sit at their desks, waiting by the phones, staring into space.</p>
        <p>The rooftop Panoramic Bar looks more like a Pompeii bar, its stools and love seats covered in a fine gray dust. The swimming pool is full of rain. Some repairs have started but the hotel is still dominated by big, empty spaces filled with bored, lonely looks.</p>
        <p>Muhammad Suleiman, the food and beverage manager, wanted to show a visitor the Orient Express, a Chinese restaurant with booths made to look like little railroad cars. Mr. Suleiman said it was once the greatest Chinese restaurant in the Middle East. Now, it is closed.</p>
        <p>''This is where the people waited,'' Mr. Suleiman said, pointing to a red velvet alcove. And then he stepped into a booth and said, with a catch in his voice, ''And this is where the people sat.''</p>
