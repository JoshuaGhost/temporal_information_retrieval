        <p>CAN modern technology go one better than cookware that has been used for centuries?</p>
        <p>Armed with about 14 pounds of raw chicken and a ''show me'' attitude, I set out to see whether three new tagines could improve on the traditional cone-shaped terra-cotta baking dish that is as essential to North African cookery as a wok is to Asian.</p>
        <p>The original tagine, humble and undecorated, has a heavy, shallow glazed dish, almost like a pie plate, as its bottom. The conical lid has a jaunty topknot used as a handle.</p>
        <p>Though a tagine like this can go into the oven, it is meant to be used on top of the stove or on a charcoal burner, as it is in back road cafes and top restaurants in Morocco. Food, sometimes browned first, is set to simmer slowly in the bottom dish, and the lid is placed on top. As steam rises and hits the unglazed inside surface of the lid, much of it is absorbed by the clay; only some of it condenses back into the food. The result is a gradual concentration and reduction of the cooking juices, turning them magically into sauce as they meld with the fat used in the preparation.</p>
        <p>Most tagines used for years have a time-worn conditioning, which is said to add a certain quality to the flavor of the food. It is an allure I cannot dispute.</p>
        <p>All-Clad, Emile Henry and Le Creuset, cookware companies that surely know a trend, have come out with tagines that, for visual panache, outclass humble terra cotta.</p>
        <p>Le Creuset was the first to redesign the tagine, introducing a version with a cast-iron bottom pan and glazed stoneware lid in 1998. All-Clad, which came out with its model late last year, designed a copious bottom pan of shiny stainless steel with an aluminum core and a lid of glazed ceramic. The Emile Henry model, the newest of the three, is made of the company's Burgundian clay, which it also uses for its casseroles. Unlike most terra cotta, this material can be used over high heat on a direct flame.</p>
        <p>All three tagines are far sleeker than the rustic traditional one that I have owned since my first trip to Morocco in 1991. I bought it in New York when I returned, spending more than double the $5 it would have cost me in the souk in Marrakesh. (I chose to haul rugs instead.)</p>
        <p>I prepared the same chicken recipe in the three new tagines and in my Moroccan model. It's a dish I concocted with some North African references, but not a typical one with olives or preserved lemons. Culinary note: the food that is prepared in a tagine is also called a tagine. North African cooks do not make couscous in a tagine.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was the use over time that has so beautifully seasoned my Moroccan tagine, but there was no doubt at the ''dinner of the four tagines,'' as my husband called it, that the results in my old-fashioned pottery one had far more intensity and richness than the others. Each produced chicken that was nicely moist and flavorful. But the sauce from my humble tagine was the best. It even had a somewhat deeper color.</p>
        <p>The sauce in the model by Le Creuset emerged very watery and bland. The All-Clad and Emile Henry tagines were better, with the Emile Henry perhaps having a slight edge. The glazed undersides of the lids allowed too much steam to condense on the food, as with a Dutch oven.</p>
        <p>The All-Clad is recommended for a gazillion other uses. I tried making pizza, attracted by the possibility of stovetop pizza in 10 minutes, as the recipe booklet promised. I heated the lightly greased pan, shaped the dough to fit it and cooked it over high heat until it was lightly browned. I flipped it over, as instructed, spread on the tomato sauce and cheese, lowered the heat and covered it.</p>
        <p>The pizza was done in five minutes. But the condensing steam left an unappealing puddle of liquid on top of the pizza. And it took a good half-hour to scrub the pan clean afterward. The pan is also too big and heavy for making crepes, another suggestion.</p>
        <p>I was puzzled by the recipes that came with the new tagines. Most suggested using one to two cups of liquid. Judging from the amount of sauce I got with a mere half-cup of stock in my recipe, I can only conclude that the results would be soup, not sauce. If you follow one of these recipes, I would suggest starting with less stock or water; you can always add more.</p>
        <p>The bottom line? A traditional tagine is an extremely effective utensil for slow stove-top braising. But if you prefer to invest in utensils that have multiple uses, you might consider one of the new-wave tagines.</p>
        <p>Chicken Tagine With Peppers and Chickpeas  Time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1 chicken, cut in 8 pieces, backbone removed (discard or save for stock)  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 cup chopped onion  3 cloves garlic, sliced thinly  1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, diced  1 teaspoon ground cumin</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chicken stock  1 tablespoon tomato paste  Large pinch cayenne, or to taste</p>
        <p>2/3 cups cooked chickpeas, rinsed if canned  Juice of  1/2 lemon  1 tablespoon minced cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1.  Place tagine base on stovetop, add oil and turn heat to medium. Dry chicken pieces, place on tagine base and sauté until lightly browned on both sides. Remove to a platter and season with salt and pepper.  2.  Lower heat and add onion and garlic. Sauté until starting to soften, add diced pepper and sauté a few minutes longer. Stir in cumin and paprika. Add stock and stir. Stir in tomato paste and cayenne to taste. Mixture should be somewhat spicy.  3.  Return chicken to tagine, baste with sauce and add chickpeas and lemon juice. Place tagine lid on top and cook over lowest possible heat about 40 minutes, until chicken is cooked through. Taste sauce and add salt and pepper if needed. Scatter cilantro over top. Serve from tagine.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
