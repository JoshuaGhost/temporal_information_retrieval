        <p>Federal officials told immigrant advocates in a letter made public yesterday that government immigration agents would discontinue using undercover sting operations involving health and safety programs to round up illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>Such an operation generated a storm of protest in July when federal agents arrested 48 workers at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina on illegal immigration charges after the agents tricked the workers into attending what was billed as a mandatory training session sponsored by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>
        <p>Worker advocates and immigrant groups complained that such activity would discourage immigrant workers from reporting safety violations or seeking help from safety officials at a time when Hispanics were suffering a disproportionately high rate of injuries and fatalities.</p>
        <p>On March 17, Marcy M. Forman, director of investigations for the Department of Homeland Security's immigration and customs enforcement division, known as I.C.E., sent a letter to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which had protested the ruse, to say federal officials were discontinuing the practice.</p>
        <p>''This is exactly the action that I.C.E. should have taken,'' said Jackie Nowell, director of occupational safety for the food and commercial workers union. ''Using health and safety as a ruse to catch workers is definitely the wrong way to go when immigrant workers are being killed and injured in far greater numbers than other workers.''</p>
