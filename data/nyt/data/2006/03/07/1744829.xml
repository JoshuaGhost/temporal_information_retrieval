        <p>OH, I'm a regular Daddy Warbucks when it comes to tipping. Unless I spot a waiter deliberately putting his or her foot in the soup, I'm probably going to leave 20 percent or more. That bartender who spends 30 seconds pouring a cold beer into a glass and sliding it over at the airline lounge? Two dollars for you, my good fellow.</p>
        <p>Yet not too long ago, I resembled another comic strip legend, Scrooge McDuck, when it came to tipping the hotel maid. You know, the woman (and it is virtually always a female worker) who makes the bed, takes out the trash, changes the towels and generally leaves the room looking like something a real estate agent would want to show off.</p>

        <p>Yet not too long ago, I resembled another comic strip legend, Scrooge McDuck, when it came to tipping the hotel maid. You know, the woman (and it is virtually always a female worker) who makes the bed, takes out the trash, changes the towels and generally leaves the room looking like something a real estate agent would want to show off.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because they were unseen, working in the room when the guest was gone, hotel maids were generally overlooked by many travelers until fairly recently.</p>
        <p>A seasoned business traveler would always make sure to have a bunch of singles on hand to take care of the parking valet, the bellhop, the doorman and the cabby. But the maid?</p>
        <p>''It really hadn't occurred to me until fairly recently that I should be tipping the maid,'' said Jim Dougans of Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dougans, 53, runs a company called New Church Development Consultants that evaluates demographics and scouts locations for the development of new churches.</p>
        <p>Business is booming, and Mr. Dougans says the pace of his business travel has picked up to the point that he is on the road one week of every month.</p>
        <p>''So the issue came to prominence in my mind as I spent more time I hotels,'' he said. He began thinking and reading about the circumstances of hotel workers, many of whom are immigrants in the ranks of the working poor, ''I pretty much assumed if you're working you're able to get by.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dougans said he usually stays in Hampton Inns, a midlevel brand of Hilton Hotels, where he presumes (correctly) that ''the maids are better off than those at some little roadside motel.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said: ''This job is really low status and low-paying no matter where it's done. So I figure it's no big deal to me leaving a few dollars a day, and for them it might make a difference. At least it makes a connection.''</p>
        <p>Here are some practical tips on tipping: First of all, ignore the laughable advice from the American Society of Travel Agents, frequently reprinted on Internet sites about travel and tipping, that $1 a day is standard for the maid.</p>
        <p>Big spenders, those travel agents. Actually, $3 to $5 a day is more like it.</p>
        <p>And keep in mind that hotel maids worry about being accused of stealing loose cash, and sometimes will not pick up a tip if they aren't sure it is a tip.</p>
        <p>So leave the tip on the pillow with a note that clearly indicates what it is. I usually write, ''For the housekeeper.'' Mr. Dougans says he merely writes, ''Thanks.''</p>
        <p>He said he marveled at the physicality of the housekeeping job. It has become more intense in recent years, especially as hotels in the upscale and luxury niches have added luxurious new beds and bedding.</p>
        <p>Take a look at those swanky beds. They have duvets. They have half a dozen pillows and heavy 300-thread-count sheets -- usually three sheets, rather than two, per bed.</p>
        <p>Now think about the extra work involved in making those swell beds. Yet in most hotels, the maids are still expected to do the same number of rooms a shift, usually 14 to 16.</p>
        <p>This is not a column meant to examine the brewing battle between labor and the currently robust domestic hotel business. But let's acknowledge Unite, the union that represents more than 200,000 workers, including 60,000 housekeepers, among the estimated 1.3 million employees of the hotel industry.</p>
        <p>We will be hearing more from Unite in coming months as the union mobilizes to take on major hotel chains in big cities. (For business travelers looking ahead to spring and summer, information on that campaign is at www.hotelworkersrising.com.)</p>
        <p>Tipping the housekeeper is a considerate practice, said Amanda Cooper, a union spokeswoman who says she always leaves something.</p>
        <p>''Some people leave, say, $5 a day, which can make a significant impact,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She went on: ''I wouldn't say as a union we don't encourage people to tip, but we also believe that housekeeping jobs should be decent jobs, and a tip isn't going to get them health care or a decent retirement.''</p>
        <p>The occasional tips, she said, ''don't make the difference between that being a good job or a bad job. So we also think that business travelers can do a lot by staying at hotels that do right by their workers.''</p>
