        <p>Smithsonian deal with Showtime to set up Smithsonian Network to create television programming that draws on museum collections and staff stirs concern about limited access for other filmmakers and researchers; joint venture has right of first refusal on commercial documentaries that rely heavily on institution material but Smithsonian says collections will still be open to others and curators will probably be allowed to give expert interviews on broad topics (S)</p>

        <p>A recent deal between the Smithsonian Institution and the Showtime Networks cable channels has some documentary filmmakers, historians and researchers concerned that their access to the collections and curators of the Smithsonian could be limited or cut off.</p>
        <p>This month, Showtime and the Smithsonian announced the formation of Smithsonian Networks, a joint venture to create television programming, including documentaries and short films, that draws on the Smithsonian collections and staff to explore scientific, cultural and historical events. The first venture of Smithsonian Networks will be an on-demand cable channel, scheduled to begin in December.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the Showtime-Smithsonian joint venture has the right of first refusal to commercial documentaries that rely heavily on Smithsonian collections or staff, said Linda St. Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian. That means that a filmmaker who does not agree to grant Smithsonian Networks the rights to the film could be denied access to the Smithsonian's public collections and experts, Ms. St. Thomas said.</p>
        <p>''Our collections will continue to be open to researchers and makers of educational documentaries,'' she said. In addition, programs that interview a Smithsonian curator as one of several experts on a broad topic like World War II would probably be allowed.</p>
        <p>''But if you are doing a one-hour program on forensic anthropology and the history of human bones,'' Ms. St. Thomas said, citing a subject on which the Smithsonian has extensive collections and leading experts, ''that would be competing with ourselves, because that is the kind of program we will be doing with Showtime On Demand.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of a limit being placed on their distribution options has some documentary producers puzzled and worried.</p>
        <p>''As a filmmaker, one wants to be able to shop one's work around as widely as possible,'' said Barak Goodman, a documentary filmmaker. He and Rachel Dretzin, his wife, own 10/20 Productions, which produces films for ''Frontline'' on PBS and other television programs. ''It's nothing to scoff at to be on Showtime. But it seems like an odd arrangement for a public institution like the Smithsonian.''</p>
        <p>Tom Hayden, general manager of Smithsonian Networks, said the partners did not intend the relationship to be exclusionary; rather, he said, they are trying to provide filmmakers with an attractive platform on which to display their work.</p>
        <p>''We want them to see us as an active partner in developing and distributing this kind of programming,'' Mr. Hayden said.</p>
        <p>Part of the confusion circulating in academic and documentary circles over the deal has resulted from uncertainty over just what type of projects would be subject to the new venture's jurisdiction and which would not.</p>
