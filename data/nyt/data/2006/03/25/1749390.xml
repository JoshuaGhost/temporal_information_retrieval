        <p>The Dixie Chicks Strike Back</p>
        <p>The Dixie Chicks are having their say with a single from their new album, due in May, the BBC reported yesterday. In the song, ''Not Ready to Make Nice,'' the country music trio responds to those who threatened them with death after the singer Natalie Maines, right, said in 2003 they were ''ashamed'' that President Bush was from their home state, Texas. Emily Robison, the group's banjo player, said they knew the song was special ''because it was so autobiographical.'' Ms. Maines, Ms. Robison and Martie Maguire were performing in London on the eve of the war in Iraq when Ms. Maines made the comment, ''Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.'' Radio stations in the United States reported protests from angry listeners, and some stations dropped the Chicks from their playlists. The band, winners of nine Grammy Awards, received death threats and began installing metal detectors at their shows. Ms. Maines later expressed regret for her remark but did not retract her opposition to the war. Posted on the Dixie Chicks Web site, the lyrics say, in part,</p>
        <p>It's a sad story when a mother will teach her</p>
        <p>Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger</p>
        <p>And how in the world can the words that I said</p>
        <p>Send somebody so over the edge</p>
        <p>That they'd write me a letter</p>
        <p>Sayin' that I better shut up and sing</p>
        <p>Or my life will be over.</p>
        <p>James Brown at the Tower of London</p>
        <p>William the Conqueror and Henry III built it. Thomas More, Anne Boleyn and Roger Casement met their doom there. But James Brown, left, will give it some soul. Mr. Brown, the Godfather of Soul, is to headline a new music festival at the Tower of London, Agence France-Presse reported. Organizers announced yesterday that the event is to take place from June 28 to July 14 in the Tower Moat. Among the acts scheduled to appear are the Pet Shop Boys, Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings, Jeff Beck and Buddy Guy, Al Jarreau, Dionne Warwick, Madeleine Peyroux, Jamie Cullum and Pink Martini.</p>
        <p>Streisand: Will She or Won't She?</p>
        <p>Six years after her last public concert, Barbra Streisand, below, may take the stage once more, The Associated Press reported yesterday. ''A tour is being explored, but nothing has been finalized,'' her publicist, Dick Gutman, said. Ms. Streisand's husband, James Brolin, told ''Access Hollywood'' this week that Ms. Streisand, 63, would tour. ''It took her six months,'' he said. ''She kept saying, 'No, no, no,' and now she is going to go out in November.'' Ms. Streisand, who last toured in 2000, performed several songs in 2004 at a fund-raiser for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Is It the Death Knell For Rap's Death Row?</p>
        <p>The rap impresario Marion (Suge) Knight, below, has been threatened with confiscation of his Death Row Records by a Los Angeles judge who found that he had avoided paying a $107 million civil court judgment, Reuters reported. Judge Ronald Sohigian of Los Angeles County Superior Court said Mr. Knight, a co-founder of Death Row with the rapper Dr. Dre in the early 1990's who propelled the careers of Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur, could avoid implementation of the order if he fully discloses his assets in a debtor's examination scheduled for next month. The judgment against Mr. Knight was won last March by Lydia Harris, who claimed that she was cheated out of a 50 percent stake in the rap label.</p>
        <p>Cabaret Coming Attractions</p>
        <p>Exit Eartha Kitt. Enter Mary Cleere Haran and Maria Friedman. Ms. Kitt, who was to perform at the Cafe Carlyle from April 4 through 29, has postponed her engagement until June as a result of a scheduling conflict. Ms. Haran, right, will fill the dates. From May 3 through June 2, the Cafe Carlyle will be home to Ms. Friedman, who starred in London and on Broadway in ''The Woman in White.'' Her new Sony CD, ''Now and Then,'' will be released on May 2.  Michael Feinstein will have the singer-songwriter Erin Boheme as his special guest when he performs in his show ''Isn't It Romantic'' at Feinstein's at the Regency on Friday and Saturday.  The debonair Steve Ross will pay tribute to the debonair Fred Astaire in appearances with his sextet in his show ''Fred!'' at the Iridium Jazz Club on Sundays -- April 30 through June 4.</p>
        <p>Lukas Prize Winners</p>
