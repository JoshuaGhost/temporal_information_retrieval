        <p>An independent panel recommended that the Department of Social Services get a second opinion when a doctor recommends that a child in its custody be taken off life support. The panel was investigating the case of Haleigh Poutre, an 11-year-old who the authorities said had been beaten by her stepparents. Shortly after she sustained her injuries in September, doctors determined that she was brain damaged, and the state moved to terminate life support. The state's highest court upheld the decision in January. Days later the state announced that Haleigh was breathing and responding to stimuli. The panel also recommended that pediatric hospitals have child abuse teams on staff.</p>

        <p>Correction:  March 23, 2006, Thursday  A report in the National Briefing column yesterday about a panel's recommendation that the Massachusetts Department of Social Services get a second opinion when a doctor recommends that a child in its custody be taken off life support misstated the age of the girl whose case the panel investigated. The girl, Haleigh Poutre, is 12, not 11.</p>
