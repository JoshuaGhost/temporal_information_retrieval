        <p>CBS won the ratings race on Thursday night as a case of murdered twins on ''CSI'' had a season high of 23.8 million viewers, outdrawing ABC's ''Grey's Anatomy'' at 9 for a second week, according to Nielsen's estimates. ''Grey's Anatomy'' (21 million) remained No. 1 in the hour among adults 18 to 49, but by its smallest margin this season, as ABC tied CBS in that category for the night. CBS also led at 8 with ''Survivor: Cook Islands'' (15.5 million) and at 10 with ''Shark'' (15.3 million), which overtook NBC's ''ER'' (12.4 million) for the first time. ''ER'' finished last in total viewers behind the first part of a two-part ABC special with Barbara Walters, above, ''30 Mistakes in 30 Years'' (13.1 million), but still led the hour among adults 18 to 49. NBC ranked third for the night, as a ''supersized'' 40-minute "30 Rock" made its Thursday debut with a weak but improved showing (5 million).</p>
