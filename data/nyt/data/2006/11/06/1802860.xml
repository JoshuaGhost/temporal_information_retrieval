        <p>Sugarland  ''Enjoy the Ride''  (Mercury/Universal)</p>
        <p>Some singers are eager to tell you how country they are. But Kristen Hall, a founding member of Sugarland, once told an interviewer that her country credentials were purely accidental. ''If we came out in the '70s, we'd be alongside the Eagles and the California scene,'' she said, adding, ''It just so happens that this year the kind of music we do sounds country.''</p>

        <p>Sugarland  ''Enjoy the Ride''  (Mercury/Universal)</p>
        <p>Some singers are eager to tell you how country they are. But Kristen Hall, a founding member of Sugarland, once told an interviewer that her country credentials were purely accidental. ''If we came out in the '70s, we'd be alongside the Eagles and the California scene,'' she said, adding, ''It just so happens that this year the kind of music we do sounds country.''</p>
        <p>She was right. The first Sugarland album, ''Twice the Speed of Life'' was a big hit. (Sugarland is nominated for two C.M.A. Awards tonight.) But Ms. Hall's time on the country-music A-list didn't last long: she left the group earlier this year. Now Sugarland is a duo of Jennifer Nettles, a brassy singer (she recently appeared on the Bon Jovi's No. 1 country hit, ''Who Says You Can't Go Home,'' also nominated for a C.M.A. Award), and the guitarist Kristian Bush, once a member of the major-label alt-rock band Billy Pilgrim.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hall helped write all of ''Twice the Speed of Life,'' and leaves a void. That album was full of warm harmonies, but ''Enjoy the Ride'' is louder and shinier, with a spotlight trained on Ms. Nettles, who doesn't hide her fondness for vibrato. These songs emphasize the sentiment and sass in Sugarland's country-rock formula.</p>
        <p>This isn't a subtle approach, and sometimes Sugarland lays it on a little thick. ''Everyday America,'' for example, is a rather threadbare song that aims to emulate the spirit (and, no doubt, the durability) of the Brooks &amp; Dunn hit ''Only in America.''</p>
        <p>But everything is fine when Ms. Nettles has a big, sturdy song to belt out. ''Settlin' '' is the kind of infectious inspirational anthem that could -- and probably one day will -- be used to sell something: ''I ain't settlin' for just getting' by/I've had enough so-so for the rest of my life.'' And in ''Want To,'' the album's lead single, Ms. Nettles somehow turns ambivalent lyrics into an enthusiastic refrain: ''I don't want to/If you don't want to.''</p>
        <p>This CD also includes one of the year's sneakiest protest songs. ''One Blue Sky,'' written by the two band members along with Lisa Carver, describes a beyond-Biblical flood. (''It rained for 42 nights and 42 days.'') The narrator thinks all this water must be a sign: ''I wonder will it wash us clean/Or wash us away.'' One more detail about this mysterious flood: it happens to submerge a town called Crawford.</p>
