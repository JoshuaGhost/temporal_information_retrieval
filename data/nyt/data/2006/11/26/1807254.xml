        <p>A romantic lunch at Taillevent, and the author recalls eating only her words.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>There are thingspeople do when they are first in love: they surprise each other with trips to Paris; they make reservations at impossibly expensive restaurants; they have conversations about former lovers while they eat. All of these things can happen after years of marriage as well, but the chances are infinitely smaller.</p>
        <p>Karl and I had been together a little more than a year. He arranged the trip, and I made the reservations for a very late lunch. I can't remember how it all got started, but as we sat in Taillevent, at such a beautiful table right in the center of the room, the conversation somehow turned to Mark. My relationship with Mark had been an amicable one that had come to a mostly amicable end. Karl asked if we fought a lot. Or maybe I asked Karl if he fought with his ex-wife, and so in return he asked me about Mark.</p>
        <p>The waiter came and handed me a wine list the size of a tombstone. I turned the pages for a moment, the way I might have turned the pages of a calculus exam, with some interest and not a single spark of comprehension. ''White,'' I said, and Karl, who doesn't drink, just shook his head.</p>
        <p>''The worst fight we ever had wasn't exactly a fight,'' I said. ''We were playing a word game. When he told me about it, I said I wanted to play, but then I couldn't figure out the answer, and he wouldn't stop. He just kept playing it and playing it and, I don't know --''</p>
        <p>The waiter came to take our orders. We ordered something. Some food.</p>
        <p>''What?'' Karl asked after the waiter had gone.</p>
        <p>I remembered the fight very clearly. We were in the car, and Mark was driving, and when we got to a red light I opened the door and got out. I walked through the traffic to the curb, something I have never done before or since. ''I thought I was going to kill him.''</p>
        <p>''So what's the game?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''It isn't hard. That's what's so awful about it. Once I actually got it, it was simple.''</p>
        <p>Karl sat back. He was beautiful in the rich light, beautiful between the damask draperies and the thick white tablecloth. He rested his fingers against the heavy fork beside his plate. ''Tell me how to play. I'm good at these sorts of things.''</p>
        <p>We hadn't been together long enough to know that we shouldn't talk about old lovers. We probably hadn't been together long enough to go to Paris. No two people are ever together long enough to enjoy word games.</p>
        <p>The waiter returned and poured the wine into my glass right from the bottle, which struck me as very sophisticated. Our appetizers came. They were something I wanted. Something I had chosen carefully. I remember that when I bit into whatever it was, I closed my eyes, stunned that anything could be so delicate, so delicious. ''I say a word, and then I tell you if the word is or isn't it. For example,'' I picked up my wineglass, ''it is glass, but it isn't wine.''</p>
        <p>Karl nodded.</p>
        <p>''Now you can ask me one word, and I'll tell you if it is or it isn't, and we keep going until you figure out what the difference is.''</p>
        <p>''Is it a plate?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''It isn't a plate, but it is a bottle.''</p>
        <p>He waited a minute. He thought it over. ''I don't get it.''</p>
        <p>''It takes some time,'' I said. ''It's a rabbit, but it's not a box.''</p>
        <p>He finished his appetizer, whatever it was. He didn't offer me a bite. ''I don't know.''</p>
        <p>''It's a tree, but it isn't a leaf.''</p>
        <p>''I give up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's Woody, but it isn't Mia.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' he said. ''Tell me.''</p>
        <p>I went on for a while, not telling him, throwing out words in patterns that irritated him profoundly. The main course arrived. I can very nearly smell it now. It was so succulent, complex, divine, but I cannot for the life of me say what it was. ''It's pretty,'' I said, ''but it isn't shoes.''</p>
        <p>''Stop it.''</p>
        <p>''It isn't stop or go or wait.'' Even as I said it, I could see myself stepping out of the car into traffic. It is traffic. I had told Mark I was through if he didn't tell me the answer. I said it much more colorfully than that. But when the answer came to me later, an easy lightning bolt slicing open my head, I wasn't angry anymore. I got it. It had taken me more than an hour, but I got it, and that joy, so sudden and unexpected, was the reward.</p>
        <p>The waiter kept refilling my glass, though I don't remember asking him to. The desserts were sublime, and we pushed them aside. The bill -- I do remember that much -- was $350. We may as well have piled the money on the table and put a match to it. It was the best meal either one of us had ever had in our lives, and we missed it.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad I found out now what kind of person you are,'' Karl said. He had never been so angry at me, not before or since. I knew how he felt. As we were walking away from the restaurant, I broke down and told him. I did it because he was walking so quickly and my heels were too high and I didn't know how to get back to the hotel alone. I told him, and I ruined everything. Mark had been smarter to weather my fury so that I could find the answer for myself, because once I found it, I forgave him. Karl, on the other hand, just stayed mad. He told me I was cruel and cold, and the next night at L'Arpège he told me it was over.</p>
        <p>''You're not breaking up with me in a fish restaurant in Paris,'' I said. ''Not over this.''</p>
        <p>And so he didn't. We stayed together for 10 years after that, and then we married. It has been a very happy union. Our fight in Taillevent is a tattoo on our relationship, though. Neither of us will ever forget it, but it all strikes me as funny now. The sad part is that the meal is gone forever. It's a fault of our brains to remember the fight while forgetting the sole. Was it sole? I know what I said, but I can only dream about what I must have eaten.</p>
        <p>Taillevent's Cream of Watercress Soup With Caviar</p>
        <p>For the soup base:</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 pound leeks (about 2 large), white and light green parts only, halved, rinsed and thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1 onion, peeled and finely chopped</p>
        <p>Pinch fine sea salt</p>
        <p>1 quart chicken stock, preferably homemade</p>
        <p>2 cups heavy cream or whole milk</p>
        <p>For finishing:</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons coarse sea salt</p>
        <p>1 pound watercress (about 3 bunches), stems removed, leaves rinsed</p>
        <p>1 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>Juice of 1 lemon</p>
        <p>Fine sea salt and freshly ground white pepper</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons osetra or other caviar.</p>
        <p>1.To make the soup base: Melt the butter in a 6-quart stockpot over medium heat. Stir in the leeks, onion and salt. Cover and cook over low heat until the vegetables are soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and cream. Raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil, then simmer on low, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2.Purée the soup in a blender or food processor or with a hand-held immersion blender until emulsified and smooth. Return the mixture to the stockpot and set over medium-high heat. Bring to a gentle boil. Using a slotted spoon, skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. Set aside or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.</p>
        <p>3.To finish the soup: Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add the coarse sea salt and watercress. Blanch until wilted and soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately drain the watercress, then plunge into the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again; do not squeeze out all the water. Purée the watercress in a food processor, then place it in a fine-meshed sieve and press out any remaining liquid. Discard the liquid. Set the purée aside.</p>
        <p>4.When ready to serve, reheat the soup base over low heat. Meanwhile, using an electric mixer, whip the cream to stiff peaks. Stir in the lemon juice and season to taste with sea salt and white pepper. Just before serving, add the watercress purée to the warmed soup and stir until blended. Ladle the soup into shallow soup bowls. Place a</p>
        <p>scoop of whipped cream in the center of each bowl and top with a small spoonful of caviar. Serves 6. Adapted from ''The Paris Cookbook,'' by Patricia Wells.</p>
