        <p>Artist Joel-Peter Witkin creates six tableaus based on work of artists from Rubens to Hopper, with female subject in each of them wearing hat by modern designer</p>

        <p>The artist Joel-Peter Witkin frequently recreates well-known artworks -- Velázquez's ''Meninas,'' say, or Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' -- in his own dark imagery. Distinctions between masculine and feminine, pleasure and pain, sacred and profane, dissolve into the ether to unsettling effect, so that Mayer and Pierson's famous portrait of Napoleon III and his son, ''The Prince Imperial,'' for example, appears to us as ''a fat man from Houston'' in the company of his lover, Eric (nude with a whitened face), an attending skeleton and a stray dog rooting around the carcass of a Big Mac. As for the photos on these pages, Witkin says, ''I thought of this as a challenge to merge historical and contemporary aesthetics'' -- in other words, art and fashion. Witkin selected a handful of masterworks, from Rubens to Hopper, on the basis of scale and content. He built sets, cast models, found props and then went out photographing his tableaux vivants to create the History of Hats in Art (or, depending on how you look at it, the History of Art in Hats). ''My purpose was to penetrate the context of each masterwork from the viewpoint of the now,'' says Witkin, who has also never been a big believer in conceits like time and space. ''To make it seem that it is ourselves alive in them, crowned with the contemporary identity of these great designers.'</p>
