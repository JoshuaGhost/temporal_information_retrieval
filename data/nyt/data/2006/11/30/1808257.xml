        <p>The third and final space shuttle flight of the year, an intricate mission to continue construction of the International Space Station, is to blast off on Dec. 7, NASA managers announced Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After a two-day meeting to review the mission at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the shuttle Discovery would be launched next Thursday at 9:35 p.m., the first night launching in four years.</p>
        <p>Since the Columbia disaster in 2003, NASA has restricted the three shuttle launchings to daylight hours so that it could take detailed photographs and measurements to assure that safety modifications made after the accident were working. Columbia and its crew of seven were lost while returning to Earth because foam debris from the external fuel tank damaged the craft during the launching.</p>
        <p>''I think we're all ready to resume night launches,'' N. Wayne Hale, NASA's shuttle program director, said at a televised news conference after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale and William Gerstenmaier, the agency's associate administrator for space flight, said radar and images taken during liftoff using light generated by the shuttle's rocket engines should be able to spot any potentially damaging debris even in surrounding darkness.</p>
        <p>''There were really no dissenting opinions on the night launch,'' Mr. Gerstenmaier said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale said data from the three previous flights launched in daylight showed that modifications had greatly reduced the danger from debris. The added data, he said, allowed NASA engineers to refine their calculations of the debris hazard risk and reclassify it from ''probable catastrophic'' to ''infrequent catastrophic.''</p>
        <p>Space shuttle flights remain hazardous, he said, but the debris hazard now can be placed in perspective with other risks, such as those posed by the craft's rocket engines and meteoroids striking the ship in space.</p>
        <p>''It's not nearly as bad as we thought last summer,'' Mr. Hale said. ''We're concerned, but we're not nearly as frightened as before.''</p>
        <p>NASA needs the option of launching the shuttle at night if it is to meet a busy schedule to complete the space station by 2010, when the shuttle fleet is to be retired.</p>
        <p>On its scheduled 12-day mission, Discovery and its crew of seven are to deliver a metal truss segment to extend the space station's structural backbone. In addition, astronauts are to conduct three space walks to help rewire the electrical and cooling systems, and retract a solar power panel that has been supplying the station with electricity for six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerstenmaier said the mission is so complex because it involves changing the station's entire electrical system, including switching most of the outpost's equipment off and powering it up again.</p>
        <p>This task will keep both the astronauts and ground crews busier than ever before to get it done right, he said.</p>
        <p>On a typical day, he said, the space station gets 800 commands from the ground. During this mission, more than 4,000 commands are scheduled for execution during a critical three-day period, he added.</p>
