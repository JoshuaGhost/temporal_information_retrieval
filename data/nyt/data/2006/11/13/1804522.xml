        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Package May Say Healthy, but This Grocer Begs to Differ'' (front page, Nov. 6):</p>
        <p>I was thrilled to read about the Hannaford Brothers Guiding Stars rating system for the nutritional value of the food in its stores.</p>
        <p>As someone who tries to eat healthy food, I am frustrated by the claims on food labels. It is encouraging to see someone helping consumers make informed food choices.</p>
        <p>The question from a Campbell Soup executive (''What are they calling too much salt?'') is an example of how processed food claims can confuse consumers.</p>
        <p>If people do the research (the information is on the Web), they'll find that many low-sodium products (including Campbell's Healthy Request line of soup) have too much salt.</p>
        <p>The fact that these products have less salt than the normal versions is not the point.</p>
        <p>The statement by a food industry observer that ''nothing is healthy if you get right down to it'' is fatalistic and not true.</p>
        <p>An informed consumer can find healthy food on store shelves, including canned foods, and can use it to make delicious meals.</p>
        <p>Many choices for health-conscious eaters once tasted like cardboard, but that's not the case now. Saying that nutrition is subjective and that there are no healthy foods is doing the public a disservice.</p>
        <p>Hannaford and others will serve the public greatly through their independent rating systems.</p>
        <p>Arlyn Purcell  Philadelphia, Nov. 6, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>People, get over it. If the food comes in a jar, can, cellophane wrapper, from the frozen-food aisle or deli, out of a takeout box, container or bag, it is going to contain something that is not good for you.</p>
        <p>Do yourself a favor. Grill a piece of fish or chicken, or even a steak. Toss a salad with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Try not to worry too much about the polluted waters, salmonella or mad cow disease, and move on.</p>
        <p>Madeline Hayes  Malibu, Calif., Nov. 6, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's sad indeed when a diet free of most processed foods is considered ''Spartan.'' This attitude explains why Americans suffer high rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.</p>
        <p>I eliminated processed foods containing sugar, corn syrup and trans fat from my diet last January. I buy peanut butter that contains only peanuts and salt, and bread from the bakery because it's free of sugar and corn syrup. This is in addition to fruit, vegetables and fish, chicken, beef and beans.</p>
        <p>This diet does not require much self-discipline because I eat plenty of cheese, whole wheat or multigrain pasta, dried fruit, nuts of all kinds and chocolate (70 percent cocoa).</p>
        <p>I don't know where these foods fall on Hannaford's scale, but when I had blood work done in June, my cholesterol level was 171.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Greenspan  Philadelphia, Nov. 7, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>All too often, we have very little idea what we are putting into our bodies, especially with the chemicals that make up a large part of grocery store selection.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Hannaford Brothers' bold new reassessment of health foods, Americans will be thinking more about what is in the product they are dropping into their carts and not just about what is on the label.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that I don't enjoy some hydrogenated oil from time to time; it's important to indulge.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Hannaford's new food rating system should not be considered the right way to choose our food. Rather, we should remember not to take products at label value.</p>
        <p>Lily Szajnberg  Providence, R.I., Nov. 6, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that a food industry tracker said ''it was unrealistic for the manufacturers to remove all the fat, sugar and salt because nobody would buy the result.'' Exactly!</p>
        <p>Manufacturers aren't spending millions in research creating all these tasty snacks and foods to meet existing consumer demand. Instead, they are creating consumer demand by tinkering with the taste so that the consumer will become addicted to the product and keep buying it.</p>
        <p>Is there a known instance of anyone ever stopping with a single ''serving'' of seven or eight nachos?</p>
        <p>Bravo for Hannaford Brothers. It is doing what the government has failed to do.</p>
        <p>Carol Haskill  San Francisco, Nov. 6, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With respect to Hannaford's Guiding Stars, a Campbell Soup Company executive says: ''I don't know what their system is. What are they calling too much salt?'' This is disingenuous.</p>
        <p>The Nutrition and Wellness page at Campbell's own Web site includes the information that the 2005 Dietary Guidelines recommend 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, about a teaspoon of salt.</p>
        <p>One-half cup of condensed Healthy Request tomato soup (one cup of prepared soup) contains 470 milligrams of sodium. That's 20 percent of the 2,300-milligram daily value.</p>
        <p>As a registered dietitian, I know that's high in sodium.</p>
        <p>According to the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 20 percent or more of the daily value is high for all nutrients.</p>
        <p>One more comment: the writer of the article presumes that Hannaford's healthy snack suggestion of popcorn would have to be unsalted. But when you limit consumption of processed foods, you can use a little salt on foods that taste good salted.</p>
