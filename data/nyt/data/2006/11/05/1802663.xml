        <p>Joy Rolle, 30, of Brooklyn remembers when her contractions were coming stronger and closer together, before her water broke six years ago. It seemed like an eternity before she was wheeled into the delivery room. Her full-term pregnancy ended in an emergency Caesarean section because her son was in distress inside her womb. After recovery, she learned he had been born with a seizure disorder.</p>
        <p>Elsa Taveras, 26, of the Bronx was living in a Brooklyn shelter two years ago, when her doctor told her she was pregnant with triplets. Abandoned by her steady boyfriend and already caring for two girls -- one with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- she was under stress. Little did she know her triplets would have the same disorder as their sister and be developmentally delayed.</p>
        <p>And Darlene Rice, 39, of Brooklyn has faced having all three of her children born physically weak. Her first boy in 1991 was premature. He weighed a little more than five pounds, which was considered a healthy weight, but there were other complications. He had a hole in his small intestine. The list of ailments later included a heart murmur, hearing loss and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
        <p>With each diagnosis, these women's lives irrevocably changed. Constrained by low incomes, they have struggled to provide their families and ailing children proper, and often lifesaving, health care. They have sacrificed jobs, and have lost or nearly lost their homes.</p>
        <p>They are among 49 percent of families headed by single mothers in New York living below the poverty line, defined as $16,000 a year for a family of three. Mothers who are poor are 50 percent more likely to have a disabled child than those with higher incomes, according to census data.</p>
        <p>A single mother trying to carve time to tend to a sick child may start off expecting to lose only a few hours of pay. But missing one day too many can lead to losing a job. Unemployment usually means turning to public assistance.</p>
        <p>Getting off government rolls or earning above a menial wage requires training, but the conundrum is how a mother already financially strapped and with few options for child care can attend classes.</p>
        <p>''Particularly single mothers are falling further behind despite an improving economy,'' said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society. In a study, the Unheard Third 2006, C.S.S. found that mothers with low incomes will already have cut back on school supplies and clothing before health care and housing.</p>
        <p>When lives are about compromise and tight budgets, poor New Yorkers have found assistance through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. An emergency infusion of money from the fund can stave off a pending eviction, provide medication and medical equipment, send children to school in well-fitting clothes, or provide furniture for an empty home. It can also buy a moment's reprieve -- just a little time for a family to get back on solid ground.</p>
        <p>Today the Neediest Cases begins its 95th annual fund-raising campaign. Over the next three months, a series of articles will reveal how fraught lives were improved through assistance from the Neediest Cases.</p>
        <p>A Fateful Encounter</p>
        <p>The drive continues in much the same tradition in which it began on a brisk Christmas evening in 1911, when a down-on-his luck man approached Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times. The encounter impressed upon Mr. Ochs that New Yorkers were suffering despite their efforts. The following Christmas season, The Times printed 100 brief profiles. These were tiny windows into disparate situations that evoked readers' compassion, and provided them a way to improve people's lives in their community.</p>
        <p>Contributions from individuals, corporations and trusts typically vary from a few dollars to $1 million and are pooled and divided among seven charities. (Contributions from trusts and estates of more than $50,000 are put into an endowment and the income, recently more than $1 million a year, goes into the following year's campaign.)</p>
        <p>All donations go directly to those in need because The New York Times Company Foundation underwrites all administrative costs. Since 1912, nearly $160 million has been dispensed. In addition, $62.3 million was raised for the families affected by the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11.</p>
        <p>This year's drive begins with a balance of $2,057,647.78. The amount was donated to the Neediest Cases since the 94th appeal closed in February and includes interest gained from trusts and estates. Contributions have been declining over the past five years and last year, they dropped 8 percent, fund officials said.</p>
        <p>''The decline was disappointing but understandable considering how generously the public responded to victims of two exceptional disasters, the tsunami in Asia and Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast,'' said Jack Rosenthal, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation. ''We fervently hope that this year, readers will recognize the enduring distress suffered by many poor families in New York. As Mayor Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity recently reported, one in five New Yorkers -- and one in three New York children -- lives in poverty, much higher than is true nationally.''</p>
        <p>''This fund cannot answer the needs of them all,'' he said, ''but it can, true to its historic name, relieve the suffering of the neediest.''</p>
        <p>The Search for Strength</p>
        <p>Joy Rolle first saw her 6-year-old son, Marquis, suffer a seizure when he was 11 months old. The next three days he spent in the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn were the beginning of four years' worth of visits to doctors.</p>
        <p>While struggling to keep pace with his medical needs, Ms. Rolle was on the verge of homelessness. Three months' rent was overdue on an apartment that she had taken over from her mother. While trying to find a compromise in housing court and contending with her son's medical needs, she could not work enough hours as an operator at a car service.</p>
        <p>In six months she was out of a job and owed $7,000 in back rent.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want a handout,'' she said. ''I just needed a little help.'' She turned to public assistance, receiving $218 from welfare and $170 a month in food stamps.</p>
        <p>She also applied for a rent subsidy program, but was denied aid because she missed a mandatory welfare work training course, although she said she had received an exemption because of Marquis's illness.</p>
        <p>The sanction was her breaking point. Marquis's father was not in the picture at the time, she said, and her mother, her only family, was battling a drug addiction. Ms. Rolle said she started hearing voices that replayed the worst-case situations in her head.</p>
        <p>Through counseling at a Brooklyn psychotherapy center, she said she gained peace of mind, and by becoming a born-again Christian, she gained strength.</p>
        <p>During this time, she also sought advice from South Brooklyn Legal Services about how she could have the sanction lifted on the welfare rent subsidy. She was referred to Leslie Boutin from the Community Service Society. Ms. Boutin and her department, Public Benefits Resource Center, succeeded in removing the barrier and helped Ms. Rolle qualify for the rent subsidy program. The welfare program also covered the past due rent.</p>
        <p>''If I hadn't met Leslie, I would be homeless and hungry,'' Ms. Rolle said.</p>
        <p>Throughout the ordeal, she strove to develop Marquis's potential. She learned from his therapists provided by Medicaid how to reinforce his skills in mathematics and the alphabet. On the weekends, she and Marquis escaped their poor, drug-infested neighborhood to attend free events -- book readings, carnivals, street fairs and ''Mommy and Me'' classes -- in Park Slope and Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In 2004, the subsidized housing she had applied for in 2000 opened in Crown Heights. Entering the apartment felt like home, but she had no money for furniture.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Boutin used $454 from the Neediest Cases to buy a bed and dresser. As Marquis's health stabilized, Ms. Rolle returned to work and to school part time. She earns $10 an hour without benefits as an assistant to a director at Bridge Back to Life, a transitional recovery center Ms. Rolle pays $53 a month for rent that has been calculated on a sliding scale adjusted to her income.</p>
        <p>''Looking back, I can't believe I went through all that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She added that Marquis has forced everyone in her life to be more responsible. Ms. Rolle has developed a stronger relationship with her mother, who is recovering from her addiction and has become a math teacher at Bridge Back to Life. On June 19, 2004, Ms. Rolle married her son's father, Derek Bobian. Last year Marquis graduated from kindergarten with honors. With the help of the Neediest Cases, she said her home was ''peaceful, full of love and strength.''</p>
        <p>Stress, and Relief</p>
        <p>Elsa Taveras's home is full of love, but on most days she gets little peace.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, the subway rattling past her second-floor subsidized apartment was barely audible over the shrieks of her 4-year-old triplets: Jeremy, Justin and Joshua, who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
        <p>''It's like this every day,'' said Ms. Taveras with exasperation. ''If I was never referred to Children's Aid, I would be in a psychiatric clinic,'' she said, referring to the Children's Aid Society's Preventive Services in the Bronx and the help she received from Isa Andrejcisk, a worker there. ''Isa finds me solutions to my problems,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Just before their meeting two years ago, Ms. Taveras was scared and uncertain about the future.</p>
        <p>She was living in a shelter with her boys, then toddlers, and her two girls, Alondra Sanchez, now 9, and Aranza Diaz, now 8.</p>
        <p>One snowy evening, it was with trepidation that she violated a 9 p.m. curfew when she left her children sleeping to go buy milk. When she returned, an Administration for Children's Services officer was waiting for her.</p>
        <p>The agency ruled out neglect, but required Ms. Taveras to go to the Children's Aid Society, an A.C.S. partner agency and another of the seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, with assistance from the shelter, she moved into an emergency Section 8 apartment. With $358 from public assistance, $675 a month in food stamps and $542 in Supplemental Security Income, she could cover her share of the $278 for housing and her bills.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taveras's first mandatory meeting with Ms. Andrejcisk at the Children's Aid Society was in June 2004.</p>
        <p>From the worn look on Ms. Taveras's face, ''I could see that she was overwhelmed,'' Ms. Andrejcisk said in a phone interview. At the time, Aranza's teachers had been complaining that she was distracted, terrorizing other children and destroying property. Her boys communicated with tantrums instead of words, making child care impossible. Without support, taking care of her children meant sacrificing her job as a manicurist at a beauty salon.</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to work, but it was too much for one person,'' Ms. Taveras said.</p>
        <p>To address Ms. Taveras's emotional strain, Ms. Andrejcisk found her counseling and put her children in the center's day care. They also received medical checkups and were evaluated for mental disabilities.</p>
        <p>Alondra, who does not have learning problems, has excelled in school. But Aranza and the boys were diagnosed as having severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and were developmentally delayed. Aranza has since enrolled in Fordham-Tremont Community Mental Health Center and the boys are in early intervention at the Kennedy Center, receiving speech and occupational therapy in the morning before their afternoon instruction at Children's Aid's childhood center.</p>
        <p>Aranza's medication, Methylin, is working. ''It's amazing the difference; she can focus,'' said Ms. Taveras. When the boys are older, they will be evaluated to determine whether they can be prescribed similar medication.</p>
        <p>During a home visit, Ms. Andrejcisk saw that the children were sleeping in broken beds and eating on the floor. Ms. Andrejcisk drew from the Neediest Cases, $600 for clothing and $1,789 for bedroom furniture and a kitchen table set.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Taveras's home is still far from calm, but sleeping on a proper bed keeps her blood pressure down and energy up, she said.</p>
        <p>''There are always difficulties, but now it's getting a little better,'' she said. The next step: going back to work.</p>
        <p>Steps, Forward and Back</p>
        <p>Darlene Rice also knows what it is to care for several children with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Her first son, Dashawn Mobley, had multiple medical complications when he was born in 1991, but did not show signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder until he was fitted for his first hearing aid when he was nearly 2.</p>
        <p>As soon as the device slid into his ear, he darted to the pediatric playroom and banged on a drum, then weaved in and out of hospital rooms. The sight brought tears to her eyes. ''I was watching him discover sound for the first time,'' Ms. Rice said.</p>
        <p>The moment of joy dimmed when his frantic behavior played out over and over at their home in Crown Heights. Simple outings became chaotic.</p>
        <p>Searching for answers, she changed his diet -- no sugar -- and tightened discipline. But the stricter the rules, the more defiant he became. At 5, he was diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and later put on Ritalin and then Concerta. He also went into psychiatric counseling.</p>
        <p>The medication helped him focus. He learned sign language and he also progressed in speech therapy. After her daughter, Dominique, was born in 1998, she also exhibited signs of slow development.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice was again juggling doctor and psychiatric visits. She was also interviewing for jobs to get off welfare and she was hired as a clerk at the home care agency, Americare Certified Services. She lasted three years making $9 an hour.</p>
        <p>''Anytime my children were sick, my boss understood,'' she said of her supervisor. When the company changed owners, however, her schedule became less flexible and harder to keep.</p>
        <p>The days she missed work, she also missed pay, and she was fired in June 2003. She had also been falling behind paying her $500 portion of the $858 rent for a subsidized apartment in Flatbush.</p>
        <p>''I was literally killing myself,'' she said. ''It just became too much for me. If I paid the rent, where's the food money coming from?''</p>
        <p>By the end of 2003, she owed $3,000 in back rent.</p>
        <p>She reapplied for public assistance, which she had received when Dashawn was born.</p>
        <p>''People really judge you,'' she said. ''But I do what I can for my children, and if I have to put my business on Front Street I will do it for them.''</p>
        <p>Back on welfare, she received $250, close to $200 in food stamps, and a little over $500 in supplemental Social Security Income a month. With the help of Legal Aid, she contested the back rent with papers documenting every doctor visit that kept her from working, and met requirements for public assistance to pay her arrears. But just as she thought she was one step ahead, she took one step back. She was again pregnant with complications despite having protected sex.</p>
        <p>Her second son, Jared, was born in December 2005 with jaundice and a swollen kidney caused by an enzyme disorder. With her tight schedule, she looked for ways to do more for her children. A month before Jared was born, she went to Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens to enroll Dashawn and Dominique in the Big Brothers and Big Sisters program. ''He was a young man, he needed to get away to do boy things and guy things,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Stacey Stringer, the director of the program, told Ms. Rice about a mentor for her two older children. Later they discussed the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in Washington for Dashawn.</p>
        <p>Through his hard work, Dashawn was enrolled in September. Within the first few weeks, he called her from school, upset. Students were teasing him about his ill-fitting clothes, and calling him poor.</p>
        <p>Caring for a sickly newborn, she did not have money for a high chair, much less her growing boy's pants or shoes. And at 15, he is 6-foot-2 and 179 pounds.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice confided in Ms. Stringer. ''With all her responsibilities, I knew it was something she couldn't do,'' said Ms. Stringer, who was able to purchase a $500 gift certificate through the Neediest Cases.</p>
        <p>The assistance was an emotional boost at the right time. Dashawn had another medical setback -- several fainting spells at school that might be related to seizures. With all her children's ailments, her dreams of working again seem farther away.</p>
        <p>''I want to go to work, but my children are the first priority,'' Ms. Rice said. ''They need me to get them to doctors, get them their medication. When you have needs and you're a single parent, you have to make choices, and if your child is sick, you don't have much choice at all. If I don't care for them, who will?''</p>
