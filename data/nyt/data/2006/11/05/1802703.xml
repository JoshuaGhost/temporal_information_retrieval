        <p>TRUISMS ON TRIAL -- All politics is local. Incumbents are invulnerable. Money talks. And Karl Rove is a political genius. This election is challenging many of the verities of American politics.</p>
        <p>WEEK IN REVIEW</p>
        <p>DONOR SHIFT -- Many big donors who gave to the New York's Republican governor, George E. Pataki, in past campaigns have given to the Democrat, Eliot Spitzer, this year.</p>
        <p>PAGE 43</p>
        <p>RACES TO WATCH -- A look at the closest races in the battle for control of Congress.</p>
        <p>PAGE 32</p>
        <p>WHO IS THE DEMOCRATIC GINGRICH? -- When Republicans won the House in 1994, much of the credit went to one man, Newt Gingrich. If the Democrats retake the House, it will be a different story.</p>
        <p>WEEK IN REVIEW</p>
        <p>IN NEW YORK -- A special counsel found a ''valid legal basis'' to seek to remove State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi from office, but stopped short of recommending action.</p>
        <p>PAGE 37</p>
        <p>IN NEW JERSEY -- Robert Menendez and Thomas H. Kean Jr. try to squeeze every last hand, and every last ounce of voter patience.</p>
