        <p>Two former employees of an American private military contracting company have claimed in a Virginia court that they witnessed their supervisor deliberately shoot at Iraqi vehicles and civilians this summer, and that the company fired them for reporting the incidents.</p>
        <p>The allegations, made in a lawsuit filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court, say Triple Canopy, one of the largest private military contractors to work with the United States in Iraq, retaliated against the men for reporting that the supervisor had committed violent felonies, and perhaps murder, on the job.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit also claims that Triple Canopy's management blacklisted the men in the private military contracting industry, rendering them unemployable in the lucrative trade of providing private security in Iraq.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in late July. A motion by Triple Canopy to dismiss it in full was rejected by the judge last month. On Thursday, the court set a trial date for next summer.</p>
        <p>In response to an inquiry, a spokesperson for Triple Canopy issued a statement on Thursday from the company's headquarters in Herndon, Va., outside Washington.</p>
        <p>''Triple Canopy requires all employees to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards in every aspect of their work, including in high-threat environments such as Iraq,'' the statement said. ''Out of respect for our judicial system and all those involved, Triple Canopy does not comment on ongoing litigation.''</p>
        <p>Triple Canopy, founded by former Delta Force commandos in 2003, is one of several young companies that support military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries.</p>
        <p>In the suit, the former employees -- Shane B. Schmidt, a former Marine Corps sniper, and Charles L. Sheppard III, a former Army Ranger -- claim that on July 8 their shift leader fired deliberately and unnecessarily at Iraqi vehicles and civilians in two incidents while their team was driving in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>Their job that day, the suit says, was to pick up an employee of KBR, a subsidiary of the Halliburton Company that is involved in construction in Iraq, at the Baghdad airport.</p>
        <p>In the suit and in telephone interviews, however, the men said that their shift leader, who was scheduled to leave Iraq the next day, was determined to kill before he left Baghdad. (The shift leader, a former American serviceman from Oklahoma, was not named in the suit.) The first incident occurred about 2:15 p.m., the suit says, when their vehicle approached the airport entrance.</p>
        <p>Their shift leader, the suit claims, announced that he was ''going to kill someone today,'' stepped from his vehicle and fired several shots from his M4 assault rifle into the windshield of a stopped white truck.</p>
        <p>The men claim that the truck was not an evident threat and that their team was not in danger. The men say in the suit that the shift leader then returned to their truck and said, ''That didn't happen, understand.''</p>
        <p>Later that day, the suit says, the shift leader said, ''I've never shot anyone with my pistol before,'' and then opened the vehicle door and fired seven or eight shots into the windshield of a taxi.</p>
        <p>Neither of the plaintiffs, in telephone interviews, said he knew for certain what injuries had been suffered by civilians in the two vehicles that had been shot at by their shift leader. In each case, they said, their own vehicle drove away quickly after the shift leader fired.</p>
        <p>Both men said that the shift leader had told them that if they reported the shootings they would be fired, and that they feared that the shift leader, whom they regarded as unstable, was dangerous to them.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, on July 10, the day after the shift leader left Iraq, the two men reported the shootings to Triple Canopy's senior supervisors in the country, the lawsuit says, adding that retaliation was swift.</p>
        <p>''Immediately after making the report, Plaintiff Sheppard was pulled from duty and suspended,'' the suit claims. ''Plaintiff Schmidt was suspended the following day. Within a week the plaintiffs were terminated as a result of having reported the Shift Leader's unlawful conduct.''</p>
        <p>Each man had been paid $500 a day by Triple Canopy for work in Iraq, the suit says. Since then, they claim to have been blacklisted.</p>
        <p>Both men seek lost earnings and damages, said their lawyer, Patricia A. Smith.</p>
