        <p>Ryanair Holdings, the large European discount airline, said second-quarter profit rose 24 percent as increasing numbers of passengers offset higher fuel costs, prompting the chief executive, Michael O'Leary, left, to raise the company's earnings forecast for the year. Ryanair is pursuing a hostile takeover of the Irish flag carrier, Aer Lingus, and the strong performance may help persuade investors that the bid is worth pursuing, analysts said. Ryanair's takeover bid is opposed by Aer Lingus and the Irish government, which holds a stake of about 25 percent. Profit at Ryanair, based in Dublin, rose to 213.4 million euros ($271 million) from 172.5 million euros a year earlier.</p>
