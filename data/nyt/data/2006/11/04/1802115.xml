        <p>The Knicks assumed a familiar posture Friday night -- shoulders slumped, heads bowed just slightly, a mix of bewilderment and frustration between their cheekbones.</p>
        <p>Two nights after celebrating his first victory, Isiah Thomas absorbed his first loss as the Knicks' coach, a 102-92 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. It looked a lot like dozens of losses from last season. The Knicks played defense only occasionally, allowed 15 offensive rebounds and spent most of the night playing from behind.</p>
        <p>The Hawks, perennially one of the worst teams in the N.B.A., led by as many as 17 points in the second quarter and held the lead for the final 32 minutes 43 seconds.</p>
        <p>There were plenty of places to direct frustration. The Knicks received another erratic performance from Channing Frye and a lack of scoring from their starting guards. They also could not contain Joe Johnson (30 points, 8 assists), who has All-Star talent, and Zaza Pachulia (22 points), who does not.</p>
        <p>But Thomas praised his team for earning a split on the two-game trip. He saved his criticism for the officiating, particularly regarding center Eddy Curry.</p>
        <p>In a stout 39-minute performance, Curry made 9 of 13 field goals and scored 20 points. He grabbed only two rebounds on a night when the Knicks needed defensive rebounding badly, but Thomas said Curry is not being given the freedom to make a thorough impact. He was whistled for five fouls Friday, bringing his two-game total to 11.</p>
        <p>''For a while, he was talked about as being one of the up-and-coming young big men in the league, and I think he's starting to find his way back,'' Thomas said. ''And what I'm afraid has happened to him is that every time he moves, somebody falls down, which consequently makes him a little tentative moving around the lane. And I think if they let him play, I think the league would really enjoy watching this big guy develop and play, because I think he's got a chance to be pretty special in this league as a big man.''</p>
        <p>The speech was unprovoked, but it seemed to be an extension of evening-long frustration with the referees. The Knicks received three technical fouls in the first half.</p>
        <p>Sounding a little like Miami Heat center Shaquille O'Neal, Curry said the rules were applied differently to players of his size.</p>
        <p>''I've got to play within certain restrictions,'' he said. ''I've got special rules for me or something. I'm just trying to play well and help my team as best I can. But it's hard sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Curry said that players like Chicago's Ben Wallace often threw a body check before going to the glass, but that he would be whistled for a foul for the same move.</p>
        <p>''Every time I move out there, somebody flops or somebody is out there acting; they get the benefit of the doubt,'' Curry said. ''Meanwhile, it seems like I get hacked the whole game.''</p>
        <p>There were wide swaths of empty seats at Philips Arena -- and many at courtside -- although the team announced a sellout for its home opener.</p>
        <p>For the second consecutive game, the Knicks had steady offense from Curry and Quentin Richardson (19 points). Their weaknesses also remained consistent. Frye had 8 rebounds but went 2 for 11 from the field and committed 4 turnovers in 20 minutes. He missed a layup and a dunk attempt in quick succession late in the third quarter. At one point, Thomas called Frye to the bench and had him sit next to him.</p>
        <p>Steve Francis and Stephon Marbury scored only 9 points each. They were rarely on the court together after the first quarter -- in large part because of matchup problems with a taller Hawks lineup. Johnson (6 feet 8 inches) was too tall and rangy for the Knicks' undersized backcourt.</p>
        <p>The Knicks cut the deficit to 3 points with 5 minutes 23 seconds left, but the Hawks pulled away quickly, with Johnson and Pachulia scoring at will.</p>
        <p>Early on, the Knicks' greatest struggle was containing their own emotions. Francis, Nate Robinson and Thomas all earned technical fouls in the first half, as the referees held firm to the N.B.A.'s crackdown on complaining.</p>
        <p>Robinson got his technical, from referee Ron Garretson, for hopping in anger after he was called for a foul. Thomas got his technical for protesting to Garretson, saying ''What do you want him to be -- a dead man in a coffin?''</p>
        <p>Thomas later motioned to the referees to call a technical on the Hawks' Speedy Claxton, who went unpunished for gesturing to protest a call in the third quarter. Thomas said he generally supports the league's new policy.</p>
        <p>''I just want some consistency,'' he said.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Isiah Thomas makes his home debut as Knicks coach on Saturday, against the only other team he coached -- the Indiana Pacers. ''I wasn't as enthused about it as probably my wife and kids were, because they love Jermaine, they love Al,'' Thomas said, referring to the Pacers' Jermaine O'Neal and Al Harrington, with whom he remains close. ''They're happy to see them. And I'm not that happy to see them on opening night.'' ... The Knicks discussed pursuing Harrington, who was a free agent this past summer, but without salary-cap space, they could not make a competitive offer. ''I wish he would have went to the Clippers or the Lakers, because he puts Indiana right back in the thick of things,'' Thomas said. ... Four days after being released by the Knicks, Jalen Rose announced he intended to join the Phoenix Suns.</p>
