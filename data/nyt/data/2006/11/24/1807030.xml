        <p>How do you slim down Fats Waller? This boxed set smartly represents a musician of huge output and very high consistency by breaking down his radiant music into sensible parts -- thereby forcing you to understand his working life. First it concentrates on his tunes with words, played by his steady band, at the core of which stood some of the undersung New York jazz players of the '30s like Herman Autrey, Gene Sedric and Al Casey; then his piano solos; then his powerful stride-rhythm solo piano tracks; then his instrumental songs, original or not; then his versions of Tin Pan Alley songs. The essays in the accompanying booklet have enthusiasm and scholarly integrity, but the photographs are amazing: Waller and company, flashing insouciant grins at booze-ups around the world, the faces all in action. Life was quicker and more interesting around him, and it still is. (Bluebird/Legacy. Three CDs. $34.98.)</p>
