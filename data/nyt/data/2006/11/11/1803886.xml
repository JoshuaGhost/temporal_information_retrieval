        <p>An article on Nov. 3 about disputed actuarial methods used by Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, in making disclosures about the state's pension funds referred incorrectly to an investment he made in a company whose chief executive contributed to his re-election campaign. (The same error appeared in articles on Nov. 2, about the responsibilities of the comptroller's office, and on June 18, 2003, about Mr. Hevesi's decision to invest $200 million in Israeli companies.) The investment, with Markstone Capital Group, was made in a private equity fund that invests in Israel, not a venture capital fund.</p>
