        <p>As Shanghai booms, so do its dance floors. The cult of the D.J. has taken hold in the Chinese city, with a growing rank of local clubgoers getting behind the turntable at clubs like C's Bar (685 Ding Xi Road; 011-86-21-6294-0547), Mural (697 Yong Jia Road; 011-86-21-6433-5023) and Pegasus (98 Huai Hai Zhong Road, second floor; 011-86-21-5385-8189). There is even the Lab, a new school for aspiring spinners. ''If you ask a kid in a club about musicians, they can only name 50 Cent and Beyoncé,'' says Gary Wang (aka D.J. V-Nutz), who founded the school with fellow D.J. Fu Jun (both pictured, from left). The Lab's curriculum covers not just hip-hop and funk but also the more specialized sounds of deep house and electronica. At its free weekly gathering (343 Jiao Zhou Road, fifth floor; 011-86-21-5213-0877; www.thelab.cn), you can hear Shanghai's next generation of turntablists practicing their craft before they graduate to bigger booths.</p>
