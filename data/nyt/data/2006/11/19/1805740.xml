        <p>Step into Edward Norton's Manhattan apartment, and you will be greeted by a bronze idol, which the actor picked up in China last year while shooting ''The Painted Veil.'' The film is based on a W. Somerset Maugham novel, about a doctor who drags his wife (played by Naomi Watts) to a remote, cholera-infested village as punishment for her indiscretions.</p>
        <p>''He's kind of a welcoming presence,'' Norton says of the statue he purchased from a man selling antiques at a streetside stall in a small village outside Lijiang, near the first bend of the Yangtze River. His father started an eco-conservation project in China with the Nature Conservancy in 1999, and so Norton, 37, is no stranger to the country. But neither he nor the vendor spoke much Mandarin. Somehow, through elaborate hand gestures, Norton negotiated a price close to $40. ''Unless you walk into a Ralph Lauren store in Shanghai,'' he says, ''haggling is an absolutely integral part of purchasing things in China.''</p>
        <p>Located in Yunnan province, which is home to many ethnic minorities, Lijiang is something of a melting pot. From the pantomime, Norton couldn't figure out whether the man was Naxi or Yi, a distinction that could betray something more about the statue's origins. Norton wasn't so concerned about the exact age of the figure -- what appealed to him was the idol's skyward gaze. ''I always wondered what he was looking up at,'' he says. One possibility: if the salesman were Naxi, the idol might have been looking at Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, one of the Naxis' holy places, where star-crossed lovers once went to sacrifice themselves.</p>
        <p>In the end, Norton may have more affection for China than did Maugham, who spent little time describing the lush scenery, opting to focus on the sex lives of his characters. ''I don't think China has been filmed in the way we did,'' Norton says of the movie, which comes out next month. ''And it's always nice to have a little guy to remind you you've been somewhere, as opposed to picking it up down on Canal Street.''</p>
