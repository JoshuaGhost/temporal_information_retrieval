        <p>The series conclusion of ''Ally McBeal'' had enough shtick and sentiment to satisfy the constituencies that had stuck with the show through declining ratings until the bittersweet end. Those who loved it could indulge in a satisfying farewell wallow. Those who despised it (but watched anyway) could rail at the high-strung Ally's trademark ethereal ditsiness, as Calista Flockhart exited the public imagination -- at least in this incarnation -- with a final tremble.</p>
        <p>Packed with flashbacks and appearances from former cast members, the episode made little attempt to be anything but a farewell party. It opened as Ally had just told her colleagues at a staff meeting that she was moving to New York from Boston after five years with the firm (exactly the length of the series). The reason concerned Maddie, Ally's recently acquired 10-year-old, the result of Ally's egg donation in a fertility study. The purpose was to provide a plot line for an hour of self-referential nostalgia.</p>

        <p>The series conclusion of ''Ally McBeal'' had enough shtick and sentiment to satisfy the constituencies that had stuck with the show through declining ratings until the bittersweet end. Those who loved it could indulge in a satisfying farewell wallow. Those who despised it (but watched anyway) could rail at the high-strung Ally's trademark ethereal ditsiness, as Calista Flockhart exited the public imagination -- at least in this incarnation -- with a final tremble.</p>
        <p>Packed with flashbacks and appearances from former cast members, the episode made little attempt to be anything but a farewell party. It opened as Ally had just told her colleagues at a staff meeting that she was moving to New York from Boston after five years with the firm (exactly the length of the series). The reason concerned Maddie, Ally's recently acquired 10-year-old, the result of Ally's egg donation in a fertility study. The purpose was to provide a plot line for an hour of self-referential nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''You're the soul of this place,'' sighed John Cage (Peter MacNicol), foolish yet touching in his persistent infatuation with Ally. ''In some way, you've become the soul of all of us.''</p>
        <p>Like his heroine, the show's creator, David E. Kelley, seems to have impulse control problems, so he can't resist grand gestures, no matter how questionable. Cage's parting gift to Ally was a necklace, which he soberly told her was specially designed from the remains of the World Trade Center. He told her that this seemed to be an appropriate gift for someone moving to New York. (The producers auctioned the necklace -- 18-karat gold, with diamond and sapphires -- last week on eBay, with the $3,500 proceeds going to the World Trade Center Relief Fund.)</p>
        <p>While Ally and Maddie packed, Ally paused for a fantasy moment. Four dancing dolls, including the Clintons and Rudolph W. Giuliani, boogied through her imagination, her musings projected as always onto the television screen. The politician dummies were funny until Ally explained their presence (and undercut the joke) to poor Maddie, who saw only Ally talking to herself. ''Oh, it's just one of my fantasies,'' Ally said. ''I told you I talk to them sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Ally's leave-taking was combined with the wedding of Richard (Greg Germann), her relationship-phobic colleague, who took the occasion to assure his guests that he planned to have safe sex with his bride. Barry White performed briefly, a homage to the special guest appearances that became one of the show's more desperate gimmicks.</p>
        <p>There was much hugging, tear-wiping and exchanging of bland homilies among cast members past and present. Billy (Gil Bellows) came back from the dead to reassure Ally that life works out and then to vanish, literally, in a puff of smoke. Robert Downey Jr., whose tenure as Larry gave the series new life for a while, appeared only in a flashback.</p>
        <p>From this stitched-together silliness occasional moments emerged that were reminders of why ''Ally McBeal'' connected with viewers. In the middle of the singing and dancing, Ms. Flockhart sat quietly, her wounded eyes conveying a terrible loneliness. Even her miniskirt seemed sad.</p>
        <p>This actress's appeal didn't exactly transcend Ally's oddities but translated them for general consumption. Here's a fantasy: that the talented Ms. Flockhart won't be trapped by her character's sniffling legacy.</p>

Kelley, creator and executive producer; Bill D'Elia, executive producer; Alice West, co-executive producer; Steve Robin, supervising producer; Pamela Wisne and Kim Hamberg, producers; Roberto Benabib and Connie Burge, consulting producers.
