        <p>American warplanes bombed a group of suspected Qaeda and Taliban fighters today as they were setting up mortars within striking distance of an airfield in eastern Afghanistan used by allied troops, military officials said.</p>
        <p>Just before nightfall, the officials said, American reconnaissance aircraft detected 15 to 20 fighters digging four mortar pits several hundred yards from the airfield at Khost.

        <p>American warplanes bombed a group of suspected Qaeda and Taliban fighters today as they were setting up mortars within striking distance of an airfield in eastern Afghanistan used by allied troops, military officials said.</p>
        <p>Just before nightfall, the officials said, American reconnaissance aircraft detected 15 to 20 fighters digging four mortar pits several hundred yards from the airfield at Khost. The airfield is a pivotal hub for American Special Operations Forces and other coalition soldiers fighting pockets of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in the rugged mountains near the border with Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Air Force A-10 attack planes moved in from Bagram Air Base, near Kabul, dropping bombs and rockets on the fighters, and strafing them with 30-millimeter Gatling guns. A senior military official said the strike killed ''a few'' of the fighters, while the others fled.</p>
        <p>For several weeks, suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban forces have used the cover of darkness to harass American-led troops at Khost, Kandahar and other bases with mortar and rocket attacks that have caused little damage and no casualties. But the assaults serve as a constant reminder that hostile fighters are nearby and are not giving up.</p>
        <p>These tactics underscore how the major battles of Tora Bora and the Shah-i-Kot Valley have given way to guerrilla-style warfare. American commanders say that Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters have dispersed into very small groups to avoid detection.</p>
        <p>American forces were lucky today to catch the fighters before they could set up their artillery, military officials said. In previous attacks, the hostile forces have rigged ingeniously simple timing devices that launch the mortars or rockets long after they have fled the scene.</p>
        <p>With the war in Afghanistan now well into its eighth month, one of Washington's major allies in the fight announced today it would pull out its forces later this summer. In Ottawa, Canada's minister of defense, Arthur Eggleton, said that the 850 troops in the Third Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry would return home in late July or early August and would not be replaced.</p>
        <p>Canadian officials said their commitment to fighting terrorism remained firm, but that their relatively small army was stretched thin. Mr. Eggleton left open the possibility that Canadian forces might return to Afghanistan next spring, if needed.</p>
        <p>Canada has the third-largest number of ground forces in Afghanistan, behind the United States and Britain, and American officials were quick to play down any suggestion that the allied commitment to the campaign against terror was waning.</p>
        <p>''What we try to do in this coalition is to cycle our forces in and out for the purpose of rearming, refitting and, in fact, resting, '' Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, said at a news conference in Tampa, Fla., where his Central Command headquarters is located. ''I don't think it would send any signal at all if Canada were to take a decision to rotate'' its forces out.</p>
        <p>Four Canadian soldiers were killed and eight others wounded last month when an American F-16 fighter pilot who thought he was under attack mistakenly bombed the Canadians. Canadian and American officials said the bombing, which is the source of two continuing inquiries, was not a reason that the forces were leaving.</p>
