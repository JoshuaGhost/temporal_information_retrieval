        <p>In CELLULOID SKYLINE: New York and the Movies (Knopf, $45), James Sanders sets out to define a dualism particular to New York -- that between the real city and the mythic city, or movie city, and how the two ''reflected each other, changed each other, taught each other.'' Sanders, who wrote a documentary series about New York with Ric Burns, is an architect by trade and a sociologist by extension, and architecture is where his strength lies. Maybe a more apt subtitle of the book would have been ''New York: Its Buildings, Landscapes and Movies.'' From his opening chapters, he lavishly delineates the foregrounds and backgrounds (both on the screen and in the society) of hundreds of films set in New York. In fact, he seems intent on citing every movie that took place in New York -- he comes close, from 1903 (''At the Foot of the Flatiron'') to 1999 (''Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai'') -- and by doing so ends up discussing some unworthy films. But his exhaustive research is supported by a multifaceted understanding (and love) of the city. And when it appears the book could become another narrow look at New York-equals-Manhattan, he takes a wide-angle view of the other boroughs, lovingly evoking ''Marty,'' ''True Love,'' ''Queens Logic,'' ''Working Girl'' and ''I Like It Like That.'' The ample movie stills are refreshingly unpredictable and perfectly illustrate Sanders's fresh ways of thinking and seeing.</p>
