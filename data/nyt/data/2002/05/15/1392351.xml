        <p>Why, Mrs. Lovett  you're, you're beautiful!</p>
        <p>So maybe she does resemble a brightly colored rag mop that's been pushed across the tiles one too many times. Love, as any Harlequin romance will tell you, makes a woman beautiful. And as brilliantly embodied by Christine Baranski, Mrs. Lovett, the cannibal pie maker of Stephen Sondheim's ''Sweeney Todd,'' is definitely a woman in love.</p>
        <p>There's plenty of chemistry when ghoul meets ghoul in Christopher Ashley's staging of ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,'' the inaugural production of the wonderfully ambitious Stephen Sondheim Festival that continues through Aug. 25 at the Kennedy Center here.</p>
        <p>It is, of course, an unusually toxic chemistry that crackles between the show's title character (Brian Stokes Mitchell) and Mrs. Lovett, as they realize they were made for each other in ways both psychological and utilitarian. And while the consummation she's devoutly wishing for is of the usual marital sort, his involves the letting of oceans of blood.</p>
        <p>Yet for all that, and for all the misanthropy that courses through the show, this story of a homicidal barber who wreaks revengeful havoc in 19th-century London comes across more clearly than ever as a fractured love story. It is also, among any other things, an exercise in Grand Guignol, an angry social indictment and one of the most ravishingly scored musicals ever written.</p>
        <p>But with Ms. Baranski and Mr. Mitchell at its center, the evening takes on a polluted air of Darby and Joan domesticity: it's a fireside portrait of a match made in hell. Granted, this latest interpretation of Mr. Sondheim's masterpiece, which has a book by Hugh Wheeler, is not chock full of directorial inventiveness. It's a handsomely mounted, richly sung show with top-of-the line scenery (Derek McLane), lighting (Howell Binkley) and costumes (David C. Woolard), which should allay any doubts that the festival's $10 million budget is not being judiciously used.</p>
        <p>This is a cautious, respectful take on a defiantly daring musical, a staging that falls squarely between the epic and intimate ''Sweeney Todds'' of years past. (Mr. McLane's ''Hard Times''-style streetscape with industrial catwalks and rolling platforms, pays explicit homage to Eugene Lee's immense set for the 1979 production.)</p>
        <p>Nonetheless I found myself hearing new things in a score I have listened to hundreds of times since I saw the original Broadway version in 1979. And I found myself wondering anew at how specifically Mr. Sondheim uses music to define character. This despite some uncertain harmonizing and sound system glitches, which gave unwelcome new meaning to Mr. Sondheim's themes of dislocation and fractured identity, at the Sunday matinee.</p>
        <p>Much of this sense of rediscovery can be attributed to Ms. Baranski, who previously sang the role of Mrs. Lovett in a concert version in Los Angeles. It would be heresy to say that she improves on Angela Lansbury, whose creation of Mrs. Lovett was the high point in a career filled with pinnacles.</p>
        <p>But it can definitely be said that Ms. Baranski, a New York stage star who became nationally famous for the sitcom ''Cybill,'' holds her own against the memory of Ms. Lansbury's singular combination of music-hall craft and operatic presence.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baranski offers up a Mrs. Lovett who is younger and more sensual with a warm throb in her voice and a cold gleam in her eye. When she first recognizes her Mr. Todd, who is back in London after 15 years of unjust penal servitude in Australia, you can sense both the calculation and the love-struck flutteriness in her appraisal.</p>
        <p>Alternately sweet and vulgar, swoony and pragmatic in her multitoned singing and line readings, Ms. Baranski gives us a Mrs. Lovett who slyly incarnates Victorian middle-class values, seeing no contradiction between her homicidal and maternal instincts. All she wants after all is entrepreneurial success, a few creature comforts and a fellow to cuddle with. As she sings, ''Times is hard.''</p>
        <p>Like many a good woman, Mrs. Lovett makes the mistake of thinking she can change the man she's set her cap for. Mr. Mitchell, the charismatic star of ''Ragtime'' and the recent revival of ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' demonstrates from the outset just how much of a mistake that is.</p>
        <p>His gaze robotically fixed and his speaking voice pitched at a single gravelly level, this Sweeney is hypnotized by his lust for revenge. He has that perverse, messianic purity associated with monomania.</p>
        <p>This interpretation gives Mr. Mitchell's dialogue a flatness that could use at least a spark more of variety. But when he sings, he dazzles, infusing Sweeney with a Biblical fire in ''Epiphany,'' when he realizes his mission in life: to kill as many souls as possible in his barber's charm.</p>
        <p>He's as otherworldly and unworldly as Mrs. Lovett is worldly. His great song of revelation gets its ideal postscript when Ms. Baranski says with deadpan exasperation, ''That's all well and good,'' and then points out that they have a fresh corpse to dispose of.</p>
        <p>The pair then segues into what is nearly always the high point of ''Sweeney Todd'' and does not disappoint here: the duet ''A Little Priest'' in which they hit upon their scheme for converting the newly dead into meat pies. Mr. Mitchell and Ms. Baranski are both sublime here as he unbends and she undulates into the logic and the self-delighted word play of the possibilities of serving mankind on a platter.</p>
        <p>While no one else in the cast reaches that level (and who could?), there are sharply etched characterizations from Walter Charles as the villainous and (literally) self-flagellating Judge Turpin, Mary Beth Peil as the demented beggar woman and especially Mark Price, who brings a feral sharpness to the sentimentally conceived role of the simple-minded lad whom Mrs. Lovett befriends.</p>
        <p>As Anthony Hope and Johanna, the young sailor and the virginal ward of the judge, Hugh Panaro and Celia Keenan-Bolger don't entirely escape the fate of seeming like stock-company ingénues. (And where did a common sailor get such a posh accent?) But Mr. Ashley has ingeniously stressed the less innocent aspects of the characters, emphasizing the selfish anger and the not-so-pretty lustiness of both.</p>
        <p>Personally, I've never been a big fan of the sadomasochistic fantasies centered on the judge in the show. They may point out the darkness beneath pious posturing, but they still seem joltingly interpolated, especially in this production.</p>
        <p>But really, who has the right to complain when you have Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations, an orchestra that knows how to play them and a cast that appreciates that every note sung is another brush stroke in a complex psychological portrait?</p>
        <p>What a pleasure it is to hear such fine renditions of songs that so subtly blend lush period melodies with the high anxiety of a Bernard Hermann movie score: the airiness shading into violence of ''Pretty Women,'' the extraordinary counterpoints of styles and sensibilities in the quartets and the chilling heartiness of the ensemble number ''God, That's Good.''</p>
        <p>That's reason enough to declare the opening of the Sondheim Festival a success. And if each of the five subsequent productions (the next is ''Company'') offers anything nearly as eye-opening as Ms. Baranski's Mrs. Lovett, well, those swampy summer days of Washington are starting to look something like paradise.</p>
