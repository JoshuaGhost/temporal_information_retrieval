        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has ruled that the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission must give cabdrivers a chance to defend themselves before it can revoke their licenses for illegally refusing to pick up people who hail them.</p>
        <p>The decision came in a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of drivers whose licenses were suspended as part of an undercover enforcement operation to combat illegal refusals. In late 1999, the operation became much more aggressive -- especially against refusals based on race -- after the actor Danny Glover, who is black, protested that he had been passed by and treated rudely by New York City cabdrivers.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has ruled that the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission must give cabdrivers a chance to defend themselves before it can revoke their licenses for illegally refusing to pick up people who hail them.</p>
        <p>The decision came in a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of drivers whose licenses were suspended as part of an undercover enforcement operation to combat illegal refusals. In late 1999, the operation became much more aggressive -- especially against refusals based on race -- after the actor Danny Glover, who is black, protested that he had been passed by and treated rudely by New York City cabdrivers.</p>
        <p>As part of the stepped-up operation, drivers faced immediate suspension of their taxi licenses if they were observed refusing passengers without a legal excuse to do so. Lawyers for several cabbies contended that the practice was a violation of their clients' due process rights under the 14th Amendment.</p>
        <p>Judge Raymond J. Dearie of United States District Court in Brooklyn agreed on Friday, writing that the drivers ''are stripped of their licenses before they are afforded the opportunity to present their side of the story.''</p>
        <p>But on another important issue in the case -- whether the taxi commission has the power, after a hearing, to suspend or revoke taxi licenses after only the first or second time a driver has illegally refused a hail -- Judge Dearie sided with the agency, saying that city laws ''at least arguably'' give it the authority to do so. Before enforcement became more aggressive, cabbies caught refusing passengers were generally subject to having their licenses suspended only after a second offense and revoked only if three offenses occurred within three years.</p>
        <p>Taxi commission officials said they considered the decision a victory. They added that they had decided recently to stop suspending licenses before giving cabbies a hearing, after initial comments from Judge Dearie indicated that he would find the practice unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Matthew W. Daus, the agency chairman, said the ruling ''truly underscores the T.L.C.'s commitment to protect the riding public from service refusals and confirms that our current practices are in full conformity with the judge's findings.'' Bhairavi Desai, a staff coordinator for the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which is a plaintiff in the case and represents 3,300 drivers, said she hoped the decision would put the agency on notice that drivers should have the chance to defend themselves. ''You'd think that the taxi industry would have already had this right for drivers,'' she said.</p>
