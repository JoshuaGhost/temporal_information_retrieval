        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a pilot program yesterday under which teams of workers from a number of city agencies would be assigned to help curb domestic violence in two police precincts, one in the Bronx and another in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg said that the teams would work with members of households ''at the greatest risk of domestic violence, those already well known to the police and to social service agencies.''</p>
        <p>He said that the teams would come from six city agencies: the Police Department, the Administration for Children's Services, the Human Resources Administration, the Department of Homeless Services, the Health and Hospitals Corporation and the New York City Housing Authority.</p>
        <p>The pilot program is set to begin next month and will involve the 67th Precinct in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and the 43rd Precinct in the Soundview section of the Bronx, where the police received more than 7,000 reports of domestic violence in each precinct last year. The focus in the first year of the pilot program will be about 150 households, based on the history of domestic violence reports in those homes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg said that a number of agencies would be involved because domestic violence had many causes, from frustration over unemployment to medical problems. He said the pilot program was aimed at better coordinating prevention efforts among city agencies.</p>
