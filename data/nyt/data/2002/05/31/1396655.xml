        <p>After agreeing to sell the Miller Brewing Company to South African Breweries yesterday, Louis C. Camilleri, the president and chief executive of the Philip Morris Companies, told analysts that the deal would allow Philip Morris to focus on its core food and tobacco businesses.</p>
        <p>But with Philip Morris already the owner of the country's largest tobacco company and the No. 1 food concern, Mr. Camilleri's comments fueled speculation about how and where the company plans to expand in the future. The answer, according to many people close to the company, is to seek new business outside the United States.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be going out and looking to make acquisitions,'' said Marc Cohen, a tobacco and beverage industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs. ''The question is what kind of returns is it going to get as it does that?''</p>
        <p>David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said Philip Morris might be interested in expanding its food business by purchasing a majority stake in United Biscuits, a leading British cookie and snack maker. Philip Morris, through its Kraft unit, already owns a stake in United Biscuits.</p>
        <p>''It makes sense if you think about the Kraft side of Philip Morris,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''They are No. 1 in U.S. foods. There are no large obvious acquisition candidates for them. In my mind United Biscuits is a natural. It would give them much more scale within Europe.''</p>
        <p>Growth in the Philip Morris tobacco business is likely to come through exploring the privatization of national tobacco companies in countries where the government owns and controls the industry, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''They played this beautifully,'' Robert Campagnino, a senior tobacco analyst at Prudential Securities, said. ''They have a number of options. What this transaction gave them was flexibility.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman at Philip Morris said the company was interested in pursuing food and tobacco opportunities both in the United States and abroad. But, she said, as a general rule, the company did not discuss any kind of pending acquisition.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's deal effectively freed Philip Morris, which is based in New York, from a laggard among its more successful businesses. Miller represented only 3 percent of Philip Morris's operating revenue last year, and it has been losing market share to Anheuser-Busch for some time. The tobacco business represented 61 percent of Philip Morris's profits in 2001, and its food sales made up most of the rest.</p>
        <p>''This really enables us to focus our attention on our core food and tobacco businesses where we have global scale and considerable potential for growth both organically and through acquisition,'' Mr. Camilleri said yesterday in a conference call. At the same time, he said, ''this transaction pole-vaults Miller into a different league, and we will have a significant stake in that company.''</p>
        <p>According to the terms of the deal, Philip Morris will continue to hold a 36 percent stake in SABMiller, as the new company will be called, and it will be able to appoint three people to its board. Philip Morris will have to hold on to its shares until June 2005, a provision that has led some analysts to believe that the company could be considering increasing its stake in the future, provided that SABMiller can make Miller grow again. Mr. Camilleri did not rule out that possibility, saying that the company could elect at some point to add SABMiller as its third major global arm.</p>
        <p>The sale of Miller was the first major action taken by Mr. Camilleri, who became the company's chief executive last month.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the sale itself did not represent a major departure from the strategic approach of Mr. Camilleri's predecessor, Geoffrey C. Bible, since Philip Morris had been trying to sell Miller while Mr. Bible was chief executive. But Mr. Camilleri's decision to use the $1.7 billion the company will receive from the sale in a share repurchase program represented a sharp difference between the two men, analysts said, speculating that the more conservative Mr. Bible might have used the money to pay down company debt.</p>
        <p>Shares of Philip Morris rose 57 cents yesterday, to $56.58, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris has long been an acquisitive company. It purchased the majority stake in Miller in 1969 when it wanted to enter the beer business. When it decided to establish a presence in the food industry, the company bought General Foods in 1985 and acquired Kraft Foods in 1988. Its most recent large-scale acquisition came in December 2000, when it bought Nabisco. That same year, the company also acquired two small companies, Boca Burger and Balance Bar.</p>
