        <p>We may think of weaving as women's work, but in 19th-century Central Asia it was almost always the men who wove ikats, the wildly colorful patterned silk textiles used to make precious robes and hangings.</p>
        <p>But you don't need to know ikats' complicated history to appreciate an exhibition organized by the Gail Martin Gallery on the Upper West Side. It coincides with Sofa New York 2002, the fifth annual show of sculpture, objects and functional art, most of it contemporary, at the Seventh Regiment Armory through Monday (Review, Page 39).</p>
        <p>Gail Martin is one of a handful of experts on antique Central Asian textiles. In the 1970's she traveled to Afghanistan to buy kilims, ikats and Lakai embroideries from Uzbek merchants who had settled in the north of the country. For 25 years she has guided the formation of the Guido Goldman collection of ikats from Uzbekistan, considered the most comprehensive private collection in the West. It includes more than 200 ikat wall hangings and robes.</p>
        <p>The Goldman collection, exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1997, is recorded in a comprehensive illustrated companion volume, ''Ikat -- Splendid Silks of Central Asia: The Guido Goldman Collection'' by Kate Fitz Gibbon and Andrew Hale (Laurence King Publishing, London, 1997). The authors are scholars who live in Santa Fe., N.M., and have done research in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman writes in the catalog that he was attracted to ikats because they reminded him of oil paintings by Kandinsky. ''I approached ikats as if they were textile paintings,'' he wrote, citing their inventive patterns and explosive colors. The term ikat derives from the Indonesian word mengikat, which means to bind, tie or wind around. It is an ancient technique, a way of wrapping thread to create areas of resist, before dyeing. Ikat dyeing has been done for centuries, not only in Central Asia but also in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Yemen and South and Central America.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin concentrates on 19th-century ikats from the Central Asian oasis cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Marghilan, a city in the Ferghana Valley. There, ikats were used as trade goods, gifts, dowries, wall decorations and clothing.</p>
        <p>In Central Asia, ikat robes were status symbols. ''The fabric and finish of a man's clothes defined his place in society,'' Ms. Fitz Gibbon and Mr. Hale write in their book. ''Within Central Asia, the close relationship between dress and rank goes far back, to before Islam came to the steppes.''</p>
        <p>Ikat robes became important markers in the Islamic world as well. ''Gifts of robes were made in recognition of services, as a reward for achievement in battle or in sport, as a way of marking the holidays, and as a form of payment or a bribe,'' the authors continue. ''Common people were forbidden to wear silk.''</p>
        <p>There is a good reason ikats were seen as so precious. Making them is an extremely complicated process that involves silk makers, silk reelers, warpers, weavers and dyers. ''A single piece can take months to make,'' Ms. Martin said.</p>
        <p>In Central Asia, at least, women bred and raised silkworms and sometimes spun cocoon filaments into thread. Then the men took over.</p>
        <p>The weavers' guilds oversaw production, selling, pricing and holy rites to guarantee success. ''Craftsmen were expected to look with awe upon the process of creation, and see the hand of God in every step,'' Ms. Fitz Gibbon and Mr. Hale write. ''All the expertise that a craftsman had was considered a gift from the holy patron.''</p>
        <p>An ikat's design was created long before the threads were woven. ''Basically, an ikat is a dyed design,'' Ms. Martin said. ''The design is dyed on the threads before they are woven into a textile.''</p>
        <p>Master craftsman would draw the design. Using that as a guide, the weaver would bind and tie the silk threads in designated places before the first dyeing process. The bound threads would be sent off to the dyer, and then returned to the tier, who would bind them in a different place for their second trip to the dyer.</p>
        <p>''The threads went back and forth between the dyers of one color, the tiers, and the dyers of another color,'' Ms. Martin said. ''For example, the Jews seemed to have had a monopoly on blue indigo dyes.''</p>
        <p>Thus the design was completed before the weaving began. There were no set patterns or formulas. The artistry was in the interplay of colors. ''It's like jazz: they knew the melody but improvised on it,'' said Mr. Hale, who is a co-owner with his wife, Ms. Fitz Gibbon, of the Anahita Gallery in Sante Fe, which has a few antique ikats. ''That's why you'll never see two ikats that look the same.''</p>
        <p>This has to be one of the most exacting ways man ever invented to produce a patterned textile. ''That's the point,'' Mr. Hale said. ''It was their way to protest Western industrialization of the textile trade in the 19th century.'' Today, fine early ikats are rarely found on the market.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin is selling a handful of colorful 19th-century ikat robes and 5-by-7-foot panels that are mounted but not framed. Each is backed by a cotton panel.</p>
        <p>The prices range from $8,000 to $18,000 each. Her gallery is at 310 Riverside Drive, at 103rd Street; it is open today and tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., and other times by appointment: (212) 864-3550.</p>
        <p>A Dealer Sells Off</p>
        <p>After some 40 years in business, the London dealer John Hobbs is selling much of his inventory at Phillips de Pury &amp; Luxembourg in New York. The first sale, ''The John Hobbs Collection, Part 1'' is on Tuesday, with 118 lots. About 30 of his pieces are also included in the Phillips sale of French and Continental furniture on June 11. The second sale will take place in October.</p>
        <p>''I'm not closing the business -- I still have 350 things in inventory,'' Mr. Hobbs said. ''I just wanted an easier life. I've never had any money. It's always more and more debts. Phillips gave me a guarantee.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs sees a lot of American decorators and their clients at his Pimlico Road shop. He is known for his eclectic, unusual taste and overscaled pieces.</p>
        <p>''His taste is exactly the opposite of what you see in period rooms in museums,'' said Thierry Millerand, the director of Phillips's French and Continental furniture department in New York. ''His taste is instinctive and certainly not conventional.''</p>
        <p>Edgar Harden, a Phillips furniture specialist who previously worked at the Getty museum, added, ''He was the first to mix very grand Continental and Italian furniture with German and English.''</p>
        <p>Next week's sale is particularly strong in fine English marble mantelpieces, antique mirrors from Sweden, France, Italy and England, and French neoclassical furniture. Lot 91 is an immense and magnificent George II mahogany breakfront bookcase, circa 1772, from Merly House in Dorset. With seven glass doors, it was commissioned for a library 80 feet long and 23 feet wide. Just the thing for a New York studio.</p>
