        <p>Prince Naseem Hamed won the International Boxing Organization's featherweight title by defeating Manuel Calvo on points in London yesterday.</p>
        <p>Hamed, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion from 1995-2000, was returning to the ring for the first time for 13 months but was jeered after an unimpressive performance in front of 10,000 fans at the London Arena. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>TSZYU WINS 12-ROUND DECISION TO RETAIN TITLES: The last time Kostya Tszyu fought he won with a spectacular knockout. Against Ben Tackie last night, he showed he can win impressively going the distance, too.</p>
        <p>Fighting for the first time since stopping Zab Judah to win the undisputed 140-pound title, Tszyu put on a boxing exhibition on his way to a 12-round decision over Tackie to retain his three titles.</p>
        <p>In a fight that grew repetitive as the rounds went on, Tszyu was simply too good of a boxer for the game challenger to overcome. At times, Tszyu looked more like he was in a relaxed sparring session against Tackie, the I.B.F.'s top-ranked challenger, than in a real fight.</p>
        <p>Tszyu (29-1-1) took few chances, content to jab and box and pile up round after round on the scorecards of the ringside judges.</p>
        <p>Tszyu won every round on two of the scorecards, 120-108, and was ahead by 119-109 on the third. The Associated Press had Tszyu, a Russian native who lives in Australia, winning, 119-109. (AP)</p>
