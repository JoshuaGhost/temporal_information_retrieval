        <p>AT Kirk Peterson's last performance with American Ballet Theater, in 1980, he led the company in Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' dressed in the tights and velvet doublet of the premier danseur. For his comeback on May 31, Mr. Peterson, 52, will make his debut as the Widow Simone in Ballet Theater's premiere of Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Fille Mal Gardée,'' wearing a frock and a bonnet.</p>
        <p>Ashton based this comic role -- a prosperous widow who tries to arrange her daughter's marriage -- on a stock female character, the dame, played by a man in British pantomime tradition. Mr. Peterson's response to his transfiguration was shock: ''I'm adorable. I look like my grandmother.''</p>

        <p>AT Kirk Peterson's last performance with American Ballet Theater, in 1980, he led the company in Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' dressed in the tights and velvet doublet of the premier danseur. For his comeback on May 31, Mr. Peterson, 52, will make his debut as the Widow Simone in Ballet Theater's premiere of Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Fille Mal Gardée,'' wearing a frock and a bonnet.</p>
        <p>Ashton based this comic role -- a prosperous widow who tries to arrange her daughter's marriage -- on a stock female character, the dame, played by a man in British pantomime tradition. Mr. Peterson's response to his transfiguration was shock: ''I'm adorable. I look like my grandmother.''</p>
        <p>In 1999, Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director, brought Mr. Peterson back to the company as a ballet master. The curious result is that he is not just starring in ''Fille'' but also running rehearsals. He certainly has the background: among the many Ashton roles he danced over the years was Colas, the romantic lead in ''Fille.'' And on a personal note, Mr. Peterson recalls, with some embarrassment, introducing himself to Ashton at a Ballet Theater party in London in the 70's, carefully shaking his proffered hand -- the one without the cocktail -- and fawning all over him.</p>
        <p>Maybe Simone is Mr. Peterson's destiny. When Ballet Theater performed in Los Angeles in those days, he took classes with the original Widow Simone, Stanley Holden. And Mr. Peterson took his first dance steps at age 3 in tap lessons with his mother and aunt, who were a nightclub act. His big number in ''Fille,'' a 2-minute-10-second clog dance with four backup dancers, owes a lot to theatrical tap.</p>
        <p>The dance, he said, ''is so sophisticated rhythmically you have to have tap training to do it comfortably.'' Manipulating the wooden-soled footwear, however, compounds the challenge. ''You can do more than you think in clogs, but it's awkward,'' Mr. Peterson said. In rehearsal, however, he was already getting a range of bright, syncopated sound from his big shoes.</p>
        <p>Another challenge: Mr. Peterson has rarely played a comic role, let alone a woman. Does he see a future for himself as, well, a comedienne? ''No!'' he boomed. ''I only agreed to do this part because it is Ashton and it is the best role in the ballet. End of discussion.''</p>
