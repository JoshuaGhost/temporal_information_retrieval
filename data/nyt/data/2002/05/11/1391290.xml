        <p>Hispanic lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, had strong words yesterday for Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democratic candidate for governor, after he called for the resignation of Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the state health commissioner, on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo criticized Dr. Novello for the health department's oversight of adult homes for the mentally ill. His criticism came in response to a recent investigation by The New York Times on abuse and deaths at the homes.</p>
        <p>United States Representative Nydia M. Velasquez demanded an apology. ''It is very disappointing to me that Mr. Cuomo would seize on such an opportunity -- the ultimate future and necessary improvement to our state's mental health system -- to needlessly attack one of the most accomplished women of color,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Novello was born in Puerto Rico and is a former United States surgeon general.</p>
        <p>Assemblywoman Carmen Arroyo and State Senators Efrain Gonzalez Jr. and Pedro Espada Jr. also defended Dr. Novello.</p>
        <p>''It is really disappointing for Andrew Cuomo to attack Dr. Novello,'' Mr. Gonzalez said in a written statement. ''Clearly he has no idea of her importance to the Hispanic community and New York State as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Josh Isay, the manager of the Cuomo campaign, said, ''It is completely divisive for anyone to claim that Andrew Cuomo's criticism has anything to do with the ethnicity of the health commissioner. In fact it had to do with the deaths of too many New Yorkers. The New York Times investigative report showed conclusively that the Pataki administration has been derelict in the handling of adult homes, and they must be held accountable.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki has defended the governor's record, saying the homes were worse under his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, who is Andrew Cuomo's father.</p>
        <p>The dust-up was yet another twist in the state's politics of race.</p>
        <p>Ms. Velasquez, Ms. Arroyo and Mr. Gonzalez have endorsed Mr. Cuomo's opponent in the Democratic primary, H. Carl McCall, who is black. Mr. Espada is a Republican.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki has courted black and Hispanic votes, and has won the endorsement of Dennis Rivera, the head of the hospital workers' union, who touted the governor's record on health.</p>
