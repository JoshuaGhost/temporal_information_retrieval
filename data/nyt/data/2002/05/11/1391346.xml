        <p>Some Yankees officials would rather wait to let the trade market sort itself out before acting to acquire an outfielder.</p>
        <p>It is a sellers' market now, more than two and a half months before the July 31 trading deadline.</p>
        <p>But one team that is shopping outfielders could have a match with the Yankees, especially if the Yankees fall farther behind Boston and George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, wants immediate reinforcements.</p>
        <p>Toronto is intent on dealing Raul Mondesi and his $11 million contract, and an official from another team said the Blue Jays might be willing to part with more desirable players, like outfielder Jose Cruz Jr. and perhaps closer Kelvim Escobar, to help move Mondesi.</p>
        <p>That kind of deal might interest the Yankees, although Mondesi's contract could make it prohibitive even to them.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays would be interested in prospects, the official said, and while the Yankees do not want to part with the Class AAA left-hander Brandon Claussen, he might have to be at the front of a proposal.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays could be reluctant to deal with the Yankees, a division rival, but few teams besides the Yankees could even consider taking on Mondesi's contract.</p>
