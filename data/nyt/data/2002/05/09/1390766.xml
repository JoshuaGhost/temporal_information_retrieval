        <p>The Charlotte Hornets, desperately in need of a pick-me-up, will get no aid from their leading scorer, Jamal Mashburn, against the Nets on Thursday in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.</p>
        <p>Mashburn, who averaged 21.5 points a game this season but has missed the entire series with a viral infection, was also questionable for Game 4 on Sunday. The Hornets trail in the series, 2-0.</p>

        <p>The Charlotte Hornets, desperately in need of a pick-me-up, will get no aid from their leading scorer, Jamal Mashburn, against the Nets on Thursday in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.</p>
        <p>Mashburn, who averaged 21.5 points a game this season but has missed the entire series with a viral infection, was also questionable for Game 4 on Sunday. The Hornets trail in the series, 2-0.</p>
        <p>He still has an instability of his inner ear called positional vertigo that is caused by remnants of his virus. Harold Kaufman, a Hornets spokesman, said that the infection could not be treated with an antibiotic and that Mashburn's treatment was limited to daily exercises meant to help dislodge the debris in his inner ear.</p>
        <p>''Ideally we would love to have our team intact,'' Coach Paul Silas said. ''There's no question in my mind we'd be 2-0 right now. But we don't and we still have to win.''</p>
