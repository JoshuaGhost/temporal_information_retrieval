        <p>Some educators say there is more at stake in Edison Schools' takeover of 20 public schools in Philadelphia than reputation of its chief executive, H Christopher Whittle, and that failure could put back movement toward private marketplace of school options; many say Whittle has surrounded himself with smart, talented people who do not know enough about business and finance to keep Edison out of trouble; Thomas Toch, writer at National Center on Education and Economy, says Whittle has become standard-bearer for people who believe that private-sector management can transform America's public schools; photo (M)</p>

        <p>H. Christopher Whittle, the 54-year-old founder and chief executive of Edison Schools, sat in his stylishly simple Midtown Manhattan office and pondered what his critics have said about him. That he is extravagant. That he exaggerates reality. That he promises more than he can deliver.</p>
        <p>Maybe in the past, allowed Mr. Whittle, a small, casually elegant man with a lopsided grin. But not at Edison, his favorite brainchild and the nation's largest commercial manager of public schools. Here, he said, executives fly coach or pay the difference themselves. And his own salary is just $1 a year, plus stock options.</p>
        <p>But others see déjà vu in Mr. Whittle's stewardship of Edison, whose plan to take over 20 failing schools in Philadelphia this summer has made it a lightning rod in the stormy national debate over school reform.</p>
        <p>Just as he promised more growth than he delivered a decade ago at Channel One, the controversial in-school television news network he once owned, Mr. Whittle last fall led Wall Street to expect Edison to get far more new schools to manage in the coming year than it did.</p>
        <p>And just as there were complaints in 1994 about incorrect accounting and unpaid taxes at his earlier media empire, Whittle Communications, Mr. Whittle said last week that Edison had settled a regulatory complaint about its reporting of revenue.</p>
        <p>Also, with Edison's overhead consuming a very high 17.3 percent of revenues last year, several investment bankers who have studied Edison's books see echoes of the spending habits that led Mr. Whittle to build a lavish headquarters in Knoxville, just as Whittle Communications was faltering. And once again, those bankers said, Mr. Whittle has surrounded himself with smart, talented people who do not know enough about business and finance to keep Edison out of trouble.</p>
        <p>This time, however, more than just Mr. Whittle's personal reputation is at stake, said Thomas Toch, a writer at the National Center on Education and the Economy in Washington who is working on a book about education reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whittle has become the standard-bearer for people who believe that private-sector management can transform America's public schools, Mr. Toch said, and Edison's ambitious effort in Philadelphia is being widely watched on all sides of the school reform debate. While Mr. Toch said he believed that a marketplace of educational options was inevitable, he said he feared that an Edison failure in Philadelphia ''would put the movement back two decades.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whittle, who seemed upbeat in a recent interview even after just completing an overnight flight from Los Angeles, explained that Edison, with its public stockholders, is a different world from the private companies he ran in the past -- a world requiring new skills that he is still trying to master.</p>
        <p>At his private companies, he said, he would deliberately set goals that were out of reach to inspire extra effort. ''But public markets are wired differently,'' Mr. Whittle said, natty in his signature bow tie and navy sweater vest. ''There, the idea is 'under-promise, over-deliver.' '' He added, ''I had difficulty in that segue.''</p>
        <p>That difficulty, he acknowledged, is partly to blame for the fact that Edison's stock has plummeted -- it closed last night at $1.26, down 94 percent this year -- just as it needs to raise up to $50 million to finance its expansion this summer in Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Whittle seemed undaunted, pointing out that Edison has already defied early skeptics by becoming one of the 50 largest school systems in the country, with about 75,000 students in 22 states. ''How many times has this company been declared dead?'' he asked rhetorically, a favorite conversational tic. ''Multiple times.''</p>
        <p>Almost as many times as Mr. Whittle himself has been prematurely declared defeated.</p>
        <p>''I have a pretty good track record on raising capital,'' he said, in a voice that still has the soft twang of his native Tennessee. ''And my critics would have difficulty establishing that I am not a good crisis manager. I've been through my share.''</p>
        <p>His business career began in 1968, when he was a student at the University of Tennessee. With a few classmates, including Philip Moffitt, he hatched ''Knoxville in a Nutshell,'' an ad-filled campus guide for incoming freshmen. A decade later, after a constant high-wire scramble for capital, it had grown into the 13-30 Corporation, which offered a host of ingenious media options to advertisers trying to reach under-30 consumers.</p>
        <p>The young company hit the national scene with a noisy splash in 1979, when Mr. Whittle and Mr. Moffitt bought Esquire Magazine, a financial invalid which had long been a showcase for America's best editors and writers.</p>
        <p>''We were convinced that we could have this thing upright within six months,'' Mr. Whittle recalled. ''But within 90 to 120 days, all of our capital was gone. We had no idea how fast this boat was going down.''</p>
        <p>But with skeptics ready to gloat, Mr. Whittle helped persuade Esquire's former owner, Associated Newspapers in London, to chip in fresh capital. Mr. Moffitt deftly handled a lively stable of talented young writers, and Esquire was eventually put back on its feet.</p>
        <p>In 1986, Mr. Whittle and Mr. Moffitt parted company, dividing their media empire. Mr. Moffitt took Esquire, and in 1987 sold it to the Hearst Corporation. Mr. Whittle took the rest of 13-30, including its popular student publications, and renamed it Whittle Communications.</p>
        <p>On his own, Mr. Whittle displayed both his widely acknowledged gifts (salesmanship and fresh ideas) and his self-confessed shortcomings (an appetite for more growth than he can handle, a habit of reaching well beyond his grasp).</p>
        <p>In 1989, he unveiled Channel One, and landed in a blistering controversy that prompted California and New York effectively to ban the network from their schools. But Mr. Whittle was able to keep Channel One alive in the face of all opposition, he said.</p>
        <p>In 1991, Mr. Whittle introduced what he still calls ''my best and most important idea'' -- the Edison Project, first envisioned as a chain of private schools across the country. A year later, he recruited Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the president of Yale University, to run Edison, and invested millions in the concept.</p>
        <p>Whittle Communications, meanwhile, was falling apart. Mr. Whittle, who was living a princely life as chief executive, had recruited talented but expensive people with little business experience, and his company was losing money at a pace that his investors found alarming.</p>
        <p>The backers rebelled in 1994, removing him as chief executive and insisting that the company -- corporate jets, lavish furnishings and palatial headquarters -- be liquidated. Almost all that Mr. Whittle personally salvaged was his stake in Edison, in which he remains a substantial investor.</p>
        <p>As Whittle Communications was being dismembered and sold, investment advisers discovered the company had not paid personal property taxes on its Channel One equipment in numerous states, and had used a disputed accounting treatment for some advertising revenue. These problems were exposed in a scathing profile of Mr. Whittle in The New Yorker in October 1994, just as Edison was trying to raise money. A mudbath of unflattering publicity followed.</p>
        <p>The headlines made Mr. Whittle a liability for Edison, he said, and his role was sharply curtailed. Reporters who interviewed Mr. Schmidt, Edison's chief executive, in those years got the impression that Mr. Whittle was only vaguely involved.</p>
        <p>In fact, according to Edison veterans, Mr. Whittle refused to go away. He sold parts of his own art collection and real estate -- including a sumptuous apartment in the fabled Dakota in Manhattan -- to help finance Edison. In 1998, Mr. Schmidt became chairman, and Mr. Whittle replaced him as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt says that Mr. Whittle's performance since then shows that he is not the lavish spender he was in 1994. ''I knew Chris then, and I know Chris now, and I can tell you, Chris is very smart and he learned a lot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Schmidt, other nationally known educators were drawn to Edison by Mr. Whittle, including John E. Chubb, a fellow at both the Brookings Institution and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a leading intellectual architect of the charter-school movement. This team says Edison has raised test scores at more than three-fourths of the public schools that it manages.</p>
        <p>But on the business side of Edison, Mr. Whittle has once again assembled a creative but financially inexperienced management team that mirrors his own strengths far more than it compensates for his demonstrated failings at things like careful cash-flow analysis. Almost none of his recruits have much, if any, comparable experience at other big companies -- a fact he said he finds unimportant, given the talent and commitment he sees in his staff.</p>
        <p>Edison sold stock to the public in late 1999, and the company exceeded analysts' expectations in 2000. But since then, it has fallen short of Mr. Whittle's forecasts. Some investment bankers who have studied Edison say that Mr. Whittle stubbornly failed to heed warnings that profits could not be endlessly postponed without risking a loss of investor confidence.</p>
        <p>And then there was Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge had publicly embraced Mr. Whittle, indicating that Edison would be given dozens of troubled schools to manage. But Mr. Ridge's departure for Washington after the Sept. 11 attacks cost Mr. Whittle an important ally. Public opposition caused further delays -- during which Edison was confronted with questions from the Securities and Exchange Commission about its accounting.</p>
        <p>That dispute was settled last week, with Edison promising to improve its internal audit procedures -- a step Mr. Whittle says was already in the works -- and to revise its reported revenue to reflect expenses that are paid on its behalf by its school district clients.</p>
        <p>But the S.E.C. matter delayed Edison's plans to raise more money by selling additional shares of stock to the public this spring. And by the time the dispute was settled, the 94 percent fall in Edison's stock price made a public share sale extremely unlikely.</p>
        <p>''And you're right,'' Mr. Whittle said recently. ''If we can't finance Philadelphia, we can't do Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>His supporters are confident that he will, once again, scramble up the cliff with a fresh supply of cash for his beloved brainchild. He has promised to do so ''within weeks,'' and at a news conference Thursday he said that five potential outside investors were now in serious discussions with the company.</p>
        <p>''My expectation is that Chris will be able to raise capital -- and he deserves the capital, in my opinion,'' said John W. Childs, president of J. W. Childs Associates, a private equity firm in Boston and an early investor in Edison. Mr. Childs, who served on Edison's board until last August, said he thought that Edison's schools were good and its chosen market enormous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Childs more than recouped his investment in Edison by selling some of his shares last March at $24.56, many times the $3.40 he paid. Those who bought those shares might not be as hopeful, he acknowledged.</p>
        <p>''But if you had bought them from me, I'd counsel you to hold them,'' he said. ''I think the company has plenty of potential.''</p>
