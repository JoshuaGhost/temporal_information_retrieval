        <p>Macari's 2000 sauvignon blanc, which set a standard for Long Island and sold out within a month last year, awakened expectations about its 2001 version.</p>
        <p>Bottled a few weeks ago and just released, the floral, flavor-charged 2001 edition ($15) is particularly promising. But judging its depth and breadth is difficult for now because its parts are still knitting together.</p>
        <p>Once again, the wine is full of verve, with a delicious lemon-grapefruit m√©lange and hints of pear dominating the taste. Sprinkles of herbs -- a hallmark of New Zealand's successful sauvignon blanc style -- dominate the undertow. The finish is exceptionally long and appetite-whetting. This kind of crisp, clean, to-the-point white defines what, increasingly, I think of as an emerging Long Island style.</p>
        <p>The 2001 sauvignon blanc is born for oysters, clams and lobsters, especially now in its emphatic citric phase.</p>
        <p>There will not be much to go around. Macari made 450 cases, and after the rousing success of the 2000 edition, about 125 cases of the 2001 have already been sold.</p>
        <p>''I'd like everyone to be able to try it,'' said Alexandra Macari, who ''wears many hats'' at the winery, in Mattituck. ''A six-bottle limit per customer has been set in the tasting room.''</p>
        <p>On Long Island, Post Wines and Liquors, 510 Jericho Turnpike, Syosset, is charging $14 for it.</p>
        <p>A consignment of the wine has been purchased by Vintage New York, at 482 Broome Street, SoHo, which has been a boon to Manhattan's growing of followers of New York State wines.</p>
        <p>The store, which opened in the summer of 2000, sells only New York wine. Because it is a satellite salesroom of Rivendell Winery, in the Hudson Valley, state law permits it to sell wine on Sunday. Package stores are barred from doing so.</p>
        <p>The owners, Susan Wine and Robert Ransom, have signed a lease for a second store, at 2492 Broadway (93rd Street), which they hope to open in August.</p>
        <p>If all goes according to the proprietors' plans, Upper West Siders who summer on the East End and are discovering Long Island wines, or have grown accustomed to them, will find an alternate source in winter when the warm-weather supplies run out.</p>
