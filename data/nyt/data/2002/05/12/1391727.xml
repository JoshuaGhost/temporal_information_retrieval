        <p>AFTER 170 seniors gather in Kenny Memorial Stadium on campus next Sunday to hear Anne Mulcahy, '74, chairwoman of the board and chief executive officer of Xerox Corporation, give the commencement address, they will be the last class to receive Marymount College degrees. Effective July 1, Marymount, the women's liberal arts college in Tarrytown, will merge with Fordham University and degrees will be awarded by Marymount College of Fordham University.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1907, Marymount College is set on 25 acres overlooking the Hudson River. Its centerpiece is the golden-domed Butler Hall, which houses administrative offices. The college draws 74 percent of its students from New York state and boasts a student-faculty ratio of 12.5 to 1. Its graduates include members of Congress, a secretary of labor, ambassadors and actresses. But a small Catholic women's liberal college faces hurdles on every count.</p>

        <p>AFTER 170 seniors gather in Kenny Memorial Stadium on campus next Sunday to hear Anne Mulcahy, '74, chairwoman of the board and chief executive officer of Xerox Corporation, give the commencement address, they will be the last class to receive Marymount College degrees. Effective July 1, Marymount, the women's liberal arts college in Tarrytown, will merge with Fordham University and degrees will be awarded by Marymount College of Fordham University.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1907, Marymount College is set on 25 acres overlooking the Hudson River. Its centerpiece is the golden-domed Butler Hall, which houses administrative offices. The college draws 74 percent of its students from New York state and boasts a student-faculty ratio of 12.5 to 1. Its graduates include members of Congress, a secretary of labor, ambassadors and actresses. But a small Catholic women's liberal college faces hurdles on every count.</p>
        <p>''No commitment is ever made forever,'' said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, the president of Fordham University. ''Our commitment is to see if this new model can be successful, and if we can restore and renew the traditions of Marymount College, intellectually and religiously. Obviously, though, if we're not able to maintain the college at an academic level and at a financial level that is consistent with our mission, we will have to make decisions about it.''</p>
        <p>Like many small liberal arts colleges, Marymount faced declining enrollment and financial problems in recent years. Enrollment peaked in 1978 with 1,112 students but, by 1998, it had dropped to 523, contributing to the decision to merge with Fordham. The 2001-2002 enrollment is 718 students, which Fordham hopes to increase to 1,000 while also improving the academic profile of the entering classes. Next year, tuition will increase to $17,210 from $15,300.</p>
        <p>''In terms of the prospects, they're very strong,'' said Peter Stace, vice president of enrollment at Fordham. ''We've more than doubled the size of the application pool this year, added 30 points to the average SAT's of admitted students, and we have 20 percent more deposits than we had at this time last year.''</p>
        <p>Religious colleges have lost favor among the traditional college-age population. Sister Kathleen Fagan '63, a member of the Marymount board of trustees and headmistress of the Marymount School in Manhattan, traces the decline to the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''When we were going to college, young Catholic women thought of only going to Catholic women's colleges and so that pool was large,'' Sister Kathleen said. ''After the 1960's and Vatican II, and of course major men's colleges going co-ed, there was an enormous push-pull toward co-ed schools.''</p>
        <p>The financial challenges affect small liberal arts colleges as they struggle to compete with larger universities. In the last decade, 140 small co-ed institutions closed or were completely absorbed by another institution, compared with 6 out of 86 four-year women's liberal arts colleges, according to recent data from the Department of Education.</p>
        <p>''When students select college, they generally want everything: personal attention, small classes, a responsive faculty and every available extracurricular activity,'' said Dr. Jadwiga Sebrechts, president of the Women's College Coalition in Washington. ''They want the full large university advantages as well as the smaller environment that is supposed to be so good.''</p>
        <p>Because the two schools have common values and a longstanding relationship, the consolidation of Marymount and Fordham has been ''surprisingly smooth,'' said Dr. Mary Ann Quaranta, the former dean of Fordham's graduate school of social service, who was appointed provost of Marymount College in January 2001. For the last 25 years, Fordham's Graduate Center at Tarrytown has offered courses in education, business administration and social service in a building rented from Marymount.</p>
        <p>Dr. Quaranta said the model she had in mind is Barnard/Columbia. ''The students will benefit from access to a major research university and they'll have the intimacy of living in a small women's college.''</p>
        <p>Academic changes include the institution of a two-year core curriculum ''to put Marymount students on the same page academically as Fordham students,'' Dr. Quaranta said.</p>
        <p>The faculty at Marymount is unionized and Fordham will honor their current contract, which runs until 2003. The nearly 40 tenured faculty members will retain their tenure, but no further tenure will be granted at Marymount. Untenured faculty members can work toward applying for tenure at Fordham University, or accept two two-year terminal contracts.</p>
        <p>Students on campus have mixed feelings.</p>
        <p>''I think it's great,'' said Rachael Holder, 18, a freshman from Hempstead, N.Y. ''We got into Marymount and we're graduating from Fordham. It's like getting into Hofstra and graduating from Vassar.''</p>
        <p>Her classmate, Jenna Adymy, is less enthusiastic because of the changes in campus policies affecting parking and visitation, which are being revised to be consistent with the residential life policies at Fordham. Beginning next year, men have to be signed out by 3:30 a.m. and students will be limited to two guests at campus parties.</p>
        <p>''I'm from Buffalo,'' Ms. Adymy said. ''So having my friends come here, and no guys can stay, and it being a single-sex college -- it's an absurdity.''</p>
        <p>Shani Carty, 22, this year's senior class president, believes the merger is a good idea because ''with the name Fordham comes a lot of different things and it opens us up to more opportunities.'' But she feels sympathy for the underclassmen.</p>
        <p>Fordham has promised to retain Marymount traditions like the President's Tea, to which seniors wear hats, and the passing of the colors at graduation. Each class has a color and, at graduation, the seniors will pass their color -- yellow -- along to the freshmen. Other celebrations, such as like the Snow Queen Dance and the May Day celebration, at which a crown was placed on the statue of the Virgin Mary, have either been discontinued or are observed sporadically.</p>
        <p>Dr. Quaranta said alumnae have reacted with anger, anxiety and ambivalence.</p>
        <p>Joyce Onorato Abamont '66, a lawyer and the incoming alumnae board president, said: ''There are some people who are probably upset because of the way it was handled in the beginning. The lack of communication set people off on the wrong foot, and we're trying to make that up.''</p>
        <p>As a graduate, Ms. Abamont is glad that the name Marymount College is going to continue.</p>
        <p>''There are so many examples of women's colleges that were open and flourishing when I was a student at Marymount that have simply left the scene, like Radcliffe,'' she said. ''I'm glad that Marymount managed to survive all that, but we also have to be realistic about the future. With Fordham, it is a much brighter one than we could have had on our own.''</p>
