        <p>Those 15 and younger can fish in New Jersey without a license any time, but on June 1 and 2 parents will be able to try a day of fishing with their children without buying a fishing license for themselves. In addition, on June 1, 2 and 8, the state Division of Fish and Wildlife is sponsoring eight free events at specially stocked lakes and ponds throughout New Jersey to introduce children ages 10 and older to fishing equipment and techniques. The programs are designed to encourage conservation. Fishing licenses cost $22.50 plus $10.50 a stamp allowing trout fishing. Those 65 to 69 years of age are given a discount and people 70 and older do not need a license. Registration for the children's programs, which are limited to 25 children per event, can be made by calling the division office at (908) 637-4125. Information on the program and on fishing is available online at njfishandwildlife.com.</p>
