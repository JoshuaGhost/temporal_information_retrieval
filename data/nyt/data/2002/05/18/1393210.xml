        <p>It's a New York vista: the red Roosevelt Island aerial tramway soars across the East River above the New York skyline, above the boats on the water and the graceful split-level Queensboro Bridge.</p>
        <p>Now imagine that the Swiss-made tram car gradually descends from 250 feet, and the spectator, enraptured by the view, sees that it is swathed in advertising for the new ''Spider-Man'' movie or Manhattan Mini Storage.</p>
        <p>For the first time since the tram opened in 1976, the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation is hoping to start advertising on the tram.</p>
        <p>''The whole idea is to maybe wrap the tram buckets, like you have buses wrapped,'' said Robert H. Ryan, president and chief operating officer at the corporation, a state entity that runs the island under a 99-year lease from the city.</p>
        <p>''When you think about it,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''what would it be worth for a company to advertise on a moving thing when people are stuck on Second Avenue trying to get on the Queensboro Bridge? It's like having advertising on your windshield wiper almost.''</p>
        <p>Not so fast, said Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, of plans to wrap the buckets. ''It's unlawful,'' he said. ''They are not authorized to advertise on it.''</p>
        <p>The point is to help pay for operating the service, which loses $1.7 million a year, according to corporation estimates. This year the corporation projected that it would lose more than $2 million because of decreased ridership and higher expenses.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the deficit has been paid by the corporation with revenue it raises through things like rents, fares and movie companies using the island as a location; government subsidies ended in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan said he does not know how much the corporation could earn from tram advertising, but that bids would be sought.</p>
        <p>The corporation hopes the effort will start soon. But Mr. Miller pointed out that a City Council resolution prohibits advertising inside or outside tram cars or stations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, whose district includes Roosevelt Island, said he might support such a plan if the money were used for the good of residents. He is to meet with corporation officials to discuss the issue.</p>
        <p>Matthew Katz, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association, who opposed suggestions like reducing night service, said he believed an agreement could be reached on the advertising.</p>
        <p>''If a kind of advertising was considered like what we see on buses and subways, both in terms of subject matter and size, that consensus could be found,'' he said. But he said wrapping the outside of the tram cars ''would be a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Some residents think money raised from advertising could benefit other aspects of the island, like theater, sports or its Main Street.</p>
        <p>''If they were to wrap the Statue of Liberty, I might have a problem with that, but it's a tram,'' said Stephen Seligman, 32, a money manager who lives on the Upper East Side but travels to Roosevelt Island monthly.</p>
        <p>But Frank Tsu, 26, a Roosevelt Island resident, described it as ''disgusting.''</p>
        <p>''It turns that iconic symbol into a marketing tool,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The corporation has filed a request for proposals for the assignment and has placed ads. About a dozen advertisers have responded. The corporation plans to meet in early June with the respondents to discuss the idea further. Ad guidelines would likely be comparable to those used on the other modes of city transportation, Mr. Ryan said.</p>
        <p>Standing on the promenade, looking across the water and toward Manhattan's East Side, Maya Maslova, 67, a Russian immigrant who has lived on Roosevelt Island for five years, said the view has ''the illusion of something romantic.''</p>
        <p>She accepts the prospect of advertising on the tram that traverses it.</p>
        <p>''Living in America,'' she added, ''advertisement is part of life.''</p>
