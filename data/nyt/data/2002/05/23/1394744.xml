        <p>KESSLER-Ethel Gerson, 80. On Sunday, May 19th in Sarasota, Florida, after a long battle with Alzheimer's Disease. Formerly of New City, NY. Ethel was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received a B.F.A. in Drama from Carnegie Institute of Technology. She worked as a social worker at the Educational Alliance in New York City, and taught kindergarten for 16 years in Rockland County. She collaborated with her husband Leonard on more than 45 books for young children, her latest, ''Stan the Hot Dog Man,'' for HarperCollins. She is survived by her husband, Leonard Kessler of Sarasota, Florida; daughter, Kim Kessler of Madison, Wisconsin (Rick Mundt); son, Dr. Paul Kessler of Frederick, Maryland (Dr. Betsy Nicholas); her sister, Freda Tanz of El Cerrito, California; brother, Mickey Gerson, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; four grandchildren, Matt, Joanna, Abby, Ally. The family would like to thank Dr. McCarren, the staff of Alterra Clare Bridge for compassionate care during the final stages of her illness. Per Ethel's request there will be no memorial services. Donations to Alzheimer's Association, 1230 S. Tuttle Ave., Sarasota, FL 34239, or Hospice of SW Florida, 5955 Rand Blvd., Sarasota, FL 34238 would be deeply appreciated.</p>
