        <p>Arithmetic that allowed Sarah Hughes to win Olympic figure skating gold medal when she trailed Michelle Kwan, bronze medal winner, after both had completed skating explained; Irina Slutskaya's second-place finish in long program, won by Hughes, bumped Kwan down to third from second in program that accounted for two thirds of score; photo (M)</p>

        <p>EVEN when people agree with the judges, the results of a figure skating competition can look wrong, as they did last Thursday night. When Russia's Irina Slutskaya took the ice at the Winter Olympics, Michelle Kwan was in first place and Sarah Hughes was in second in the women's figure skating competition. If the Russian skated well, she could take the gold medal. If she skated poorly, it seemed that Kwan would win.</p>
        <p>But Slutskaya skated neither beautifully nor disastrously, and as the judges' scores went up, NBC suddenly cut to Hughes and her coach, who were literally rolling on the floor in joy. Hughes, a 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., had won the gold medal, Slutskaya the silver and Kwan the bronze.</p>

        <p>EVEN when people agree with the judges, the results of a figure skating competition can look wrong, as they did last Thursday night. When Russia's Irina Slutskaya took the ice at the Winter Olympics, Michelle Kwan was in first place and Sarah Hughes was in second in the women's figure skating competition. If the Russian skated well, she could take the gold medal. If she skated poorly, it seemed that Kwan would win.</p>
        <p>But Slutskaya skated neither beautifully nor disastrously, and as the judges' scores went up, NBC suddenly cut to Hughes and her coach, who were literally rolling on the floor in joy. Hughes, a 16-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., had won the gold medal, Slutskaya the silver and Kwan the bronze.</p>
        <p>Millions of viewers may have been confounded by the result. After all, a skier or a speed skater could never leap over another athlete in the standings after both had finished competing. But this is just what Hughes did to Kwan.</p>
        <p>NBC's announcers did not adequately explain how it could happen, but there is an explanation, and it lies in simple arithmetic, not the scandal-ridden politics of judging.</p>
        <p>To solve the riddle, focus on the skaters' relative finishes during each of the two nights of the competition, and ignore all those 5.8's and 5.4's on the judges' scorecards.</p>
        <p>After Tuesday night's short program, which counts for one-third of a skater's final score, Kwan was in first place, Slutskaya in second and Hughes in fourth. So give 1 point to Kwan, 2 to Slutskaya and 4 to Hughes -- and remember that the skater with lowest final total wins.</p>
        <p>In Thursday's long program, Hughes skated flawlessly, executing one perfect triple jump after another, and took first place. Kwan, who fell once, was in second place for the night before Slutsakaya took the ice.</p>
        <p>SINCE the long program counts for two-thirds of the final score, these placements count twice. So at this point Kwan had 5 points: 2 + 2 for her second-place standing in the long program and 1 for the short program. Hughes had 6 points: 1 + 1 for the long program and 4 for the short program.</p>
        <p>Then Slutskaya skated her four-minute program, which seemed better than Kwan's but worse than Hughes's. This put her in second place for the long program, bumping Kwan to third place.</p>
        <p>Now Kwan had 7 points (3 + 3, for third place in the long program, + 1, for first place in the short program), Slutskaya had 6 (2 + 2 + 2) and Hughes still had 6 (1 + 1 + 4).</p>
        <p>By leaping over Kwan in the long program, Slutskaya had allowed Hughes to surpass Kwan in the overall score.</p>
        <p>The tie-breaker between Slutskaya and Hughes went to the American, since she had finished higher in the more important long program. A few minutes later, a gold medal was hanging around her neck, capping off an up-and-down-and-up night that could happen in very few other sports.</p>
