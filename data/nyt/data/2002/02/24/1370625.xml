        <p>JABLONSKI-Rt. Rev. Monsignor Stanislaus P., a priest of the Archdiocese of New York for over 61 years, died on February 21 in the Bronx, New York. He was 86. Monsignor Jablonski, the former Chaplain of the New York City Fire Department, was born in Manhattan on August 21, 1915, to Francis and Victoria Niestal Jablonski. He graduated from Cathedral Preparatory School and Saint Joseph's Seminary. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 7, 1941. His first Mass was celebrated at Saint Boniface Church, his home parish. Cardinal Spellman appointed Father Jablonski to the faculty of the new Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1942. Over the course of more than twenty years that he spent there, he established a reputation that grew throughout the city of New York for his stern and demanding expectations of students as Dean of Discipline, earning him the nickname ''Jabbo'' from a generation of Hayesmen. Elevated to Monsignor by Pope John XXIII in 1961, he was installed as Fire Chaplain in 1962. His career with the Fire Department extended for twenty years. During that time, he distinguished himself in service to New York's bravest. While still Chaplain, he was appointed pastor of Saint Valentine's Church on East 221st Street in the Bronx. He continued to minister to the parish until its closing in 2001. Monsignor Jablonski was predeceased by his brother, Louis. In addition to his sister-in-law, Vincenza H. Jablonski, he is survived by three nieces, Loretta L. Donovan, Irene E. Jablonski and Helen A. McLaughlin, and a nephew, Louis J. Jablonski, Jr., and three grandnieces and five grandnephews. Viewing will be held at the Bennett Funeral Home, Scarsdale, NY, on Saturday, February 23, and Sunday, February 24, from 2:00-4:00 pm and 7:00-9:00 pm. A Mass of Resurrection will be celebrated at Saint Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, February 25, at 10:00 am. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Scholarship Fund of Cardinal Hayes High School.</p>
