        <p>WHEN the Hoff-Barthelson Orchestra opens the school's 37th annual Baroque and Beyond Festival next month, it will arrive with high praise -- not to mention a $7,000 grant -- from the New York State Council on the Arts. The council's director, James Jordan, called its programs ''outstanding,'' noting that the judging panel found the ensemble ''ranked among the top community school orchestras in the country.''</p>
        <p>The orchestra includes about 60 advanced students, ages 13 to 18, and the results of their weekly rehearsals, under music director, Jun Nakabayashi, will be on display three times during the festival. The opening night concert, on March 9 at 8 p.m. in First Presbyterian Church of Mount Vernon, includes Haydn's ''Military'' Symphony No. 100 and, with the Festival Chorus, Bach's Cantata No. 140. The Cantata gets an encore the next evening at 7 in the Community Unitarian Church of White Plains, along with performances by smaller school ensembles. At the finale, on March 17 at 7 p.m. again in Community Unitarian, an encore of the Haydn prefaces a performance of Bach's B minor Suite, with the flutist Paula Robison as guest soloist.</p>

        <p>In between those events come free recitals at the school by Hoff-Barthelson soloists and groups, March 14 and 15 at 8 p.m., and March 16 at 2, 4 and 8 p.m. The pianist Edward Aldwell gives a baroque recital and master class at 1 p.m. on March 17. Information: (914) 723-1169.</p>
        <p>Haydn's ''Military'' Symphony also opens Philharmonia Virtuosi's program at Purchase College next Sunday at 3 p.m., followed by the Stravinsky's ''Pulcinella'' Suite and the Schumann Cello Concerto, the latter featuring Carter Brey, moonlighting from his post as principal in the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Brey will also give the New York premiere of a ''Graciela y Buenos Aires,'' a concert tango by Jos√© Bragato, while the music director, Richard Kapp, will share podium duties with Paul Hostetter. Information: (914) 693-5595.</p>
        <p>Two other orchestral programs will feature outstanding pianists in blockbuster concertos when Albert Lotto plays Beethoven's ''Emperor'' with the Yonkers Philharmonic and when Jean-Yves Thibaudet is featured with the Westchester Philharmonic in the G major Concerto of his countryman, Maurice Ravel. The free Yonkers concert, March 10 at 3 p.m. in the Saunders High School Auditorium, has another soloist, the soprano Elena Malfitano, singing ''Voi che Sapete'' from Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro.'' The program will also include the world premiere of ''A Requiem for Jerome Gino Sala,'' written by William Zinn, a longtime member of the Yonkers Philharmonic, in memory of the late music director, who ied last September. As the search continues for a successor, Alan Aurelia, artistic director of the Riverside Opera Company, leads orchestral favorites by Wagner, Schubert and Tchaikovsky. Information: (914) 476-3711.</p>
        <p>The Westchester Philharmonic has two performances at Purchase College, March 16 at 8 p.m and  March 17 at 3 p.m., plus an open rehearsal March 16 at 10 a.m. The prgram includes Bartok's Divertimento, the Ravel Concerto and Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony, No. 38. Tickets: (914) 682-3707.</p>
        <p>Here's a how-de-do: a full production of ''The Mikado'' by the much-acclaimed New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players and a performance of Brahms' ''German Requiem'' by the much-admired New Choral Society are both set for next Saturday at 8 p.m. One possible solution is to join Nanki-Poo and friends on Saturday night at the Fox Lane School in Bedford, then hear the Brahms when it gets an encore next Sunday at 3 p.m. at Hitchcock Presbyterian Church in Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>For ''Mikado'' tickets, call the sponsoring Mount Kisco Concert Association at (914) 666-9181; to attend either of the Requiem performances, call (914) 725-1678.</p>
        <p>Bizet's ''Carmen'' is the next production of Taconic Opera, with two casts and no bull, since the time and place have been changed from 19th century Spain to modern-day New York. The company remains true to the original score, though, so the opera will be sung in French, with English supertitles. Carter Scott takes the title role March . 8 at 8 p.m., Kerry Grubel the next evening at 8, with Ms. Scott returning March. 10 at 2 p.m.. Drew Slatton and Tom Roche alternate as Don Jose (in this version, one of New York's finest) with Wes Garrison and Robert Stafford as Escamillo, Holly Boaz and Rebecca Todd Bixler as Micaela. All performances are at the Yorktown Stage in downtown Yorktown Heights. Reservations: (914) 739-2165.</p>
        <p>Jewish vocal music gets a double showcase in March. Next Sunday at 3 p.m. in the Bendheim Arts Center, Harold Rosenbaum conducts the Canticum Novum Singers, with Cantor Gerald Cohen. The program includes cantorial and other liturgical settings, Yiddish folk songs and several selections from Mendelssohn's oratorio ''Elijah.''</p>
        <p>The following weekend, on March 9 at 8 p.m., a gala is planned to mark the 10th anniversary of the Legacy Series of concerts at Temple Israel Center in White Plains. The event honors Linda Hall Gerson, an assistant conductor and coach at the Metropolitan Opera (and a Westchester resident) who has organized the events through the years.</p>
        <p>The artists on the program include the tenor Neil Shicoff, himself the son of a cantor, who will be taking the role of El√©azar in the Met's first new production of Hal√©vy's ''La Juive'' since Caruso sang it there in 1920; he has promised to perform that opera's most famous aria, ''Rachel, Quand du Seigneur'' at the gala. Other participants include Mr. Shicoff's younger colleague at the Met, Alexandra Deshorties; Jodie Langel, a Broadway musical performer, and Cantor Fredda Rakusin Mendelson, with Martin Bookspan the master of ceremonies. Information: (914) 948-2800.</p>
