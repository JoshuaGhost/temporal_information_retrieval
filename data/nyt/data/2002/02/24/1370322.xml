        <p>THOUGH ostensibly a meditation on death, Edward Albee's ''All Over,'' at the McCarter Theater Center here, is really a meditation on the anticipation of dying by people who have made a botch of living.</p>
        <p>In the play, seven people sit around trading petty insults and present hostilities, and dredging up past recriminations. The eighth character is a famous lawyer who lies in an offstage room. These are the last two hours of his life.</p>
        <p>Although the conversation is about death, that does not prevent his wife and his mistress, played by Rosemary Harris and Michael Learned, from arguing about grammatical usage.</p>
        <p>The play was originally presented on Broadway in 1971. Once titled ''Death,'' it was conceived as a companion to a play called ''Life,'' since renamed ''Seascape.'' Mr. Albee has suggested that the negative reviews of the original production may have been because of impatience with the privileged, insulated characters whose main interest seems to be ''the precision of their language.''</p>
        <p>Today, there is every reason to be even more impatient with this privileged class, which Mr. Albee represents as extinct. Referring to ''the sad and shabby time we live in,'' the daughter in the play, 45 and wasted, calls the others ''pious hypocrites.''</p>
        <p>Listening to people so rarefied hardly invites emotional involvement. Given that the play's form has been called cold and objective, it is all the more difficult to be engaged in their lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albee's cosmic concerns are not so expansive as to take in the notion of death as cruel, untimely cutting off  fulfilling relationships within a caring family. To write about grief or the psychic and emotional fallout of the death of a loved one upon those who must go on living demands profound meditations on loss.</p>
        <p>Here, a sense of condescension and obligation prevails over a sense of loss. There is little indication that the dying man was beloved, or that anyone cares about those who were part of his life. Between an attention-grabbing first line -- ''Is he dead?'' -- which ignites the grammatical heat, and a predictable last one -- ''All over'' -- lovelessness is in the air.</p>
        <p>Yet, longing to be loved is at the core of the play. At the moment of finality, the wife at last rages against the dying of her own light.</p>
        <p>Following stage directions calling for the release of ''all that has been pent up for 30 years,'' the extraordinary Ms.  Harris seizes the moment. She has magically, subtly created a woman who may not be in the text. With the minutest details, she honors this work. Observe her triumphantly attending to her hair after slapping her daughter, who slapped her first.</p>
        <p>Ms. Learned invests the mistress with invincibility, class and warmth, playing  beautifully in concert with Ms. Harris.</p>
        <p>Emily Mann as director perceives  subtext not apparent to all, and apparently trusts her actors to find the heartbeat of characters who appear heartless.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this production is all about the players, with Ms. Harris providing a master class for all to cherish.</p>
        <p>''All Over'' continues in performance at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton, (609) 258-2787, through next Sunday.</p>
