        <p>Many fans who packed into the Salt Lake Ice Center tonight were wearing temporary soul patches -- black, brown or white tape on their chins -- made popular by Apolo Anton Ohno.</p>
        <p>The 19-year-old Ohno, an American speedskater, had hoped to win four Olympic medals at the Salt Lake Games. But the fans walked out of the arena ripping off their patches as Ohno walked away with two tainted medals -- and none tonight.</p>
        <p>Ohno won a silver medal in the 1,000 meters after a disqualification, and benefited from another disqualification winning the gold medal in the 1,500 meters.</p>
        <p>Tonight, though, Ohno was the one disqualified, in the semifinals of the 500 meters. And when his teammate Rusty Smith fell in the 27th lap of the 45-lap 5,000-meter race, the United States finished fourth.</p>
        <p>''This is the Olympics and anything can happen,'' Ohno said. ''If anything crazy is going to happen, it's going to be at the games.''</p>
        <p>If anything crazy did happen, it seemed to be in Ohno's races. Crashes, disqualifications, protests, stitches, lawsuits, appeals and death threats marred Ohno's races.</p>
        <p>After Canada won the gold medal in the 5,000-meter relay, followed by Italy and China, all Ohno could do was shrug. His bid to become the third Winter Games athlete to win four medals since Eric Heiden won five long-track speedskating golds in 1980 was over.</p>
        <p>That quest was foiled as he received six stitches in his left thigh after being involved in a four-skater crash and then stumbled to the finish line in the 1,000 meters.</p>
        <p>''I got a silver medal and a gold medal and another two awesome performances, so this is definitely the highlight of my career,'' he maintained.</p>
        <p>Lost in the night, however, was another skater's career highlights. Yang A. Yang of China won the women's 1,000 meters tonight, her second gold medal of the Games. She also won the 500 and helped China take the silver medal in the women's 3,000 relay. ''I feel wonderful,'' Yang said. ''After my last gold medal, I could relax, there was less pressure on me.''</p>
        <p>Ohno could not say the same thing.</p>
        <p>Smith, who had won a bronze medal in the 500 meters earlier in the night, apologized for clipping a cone in the middle of the relay and hurting his friend's chance for another medal.</p>
        <p>''I feel bad for my team, it was my fault,'' Smith said. ''That's just the way this sport goes.''</p>
        <p>That seemed to be the theme song of this arbitrary sport. Tonight, Ohno said he lost his chance for his third individual medal on his own demerits.</p>
        <p>In trying to make up ground in the next-to-last lap in the men's 500 meter semifinal, Ohno made an ill-advised pass coming from behind in third place, shoving his hip into Japan's Satoru Terao.</p>
        <p>Terao went spinning, crashing into the boards, and Ohno knew what he had done.</p>
        <p>Speaking with the matter-of-fact attitude of his wild and arbitrary sport -- ''that's short track,'' Ohno said -- he did not argue that he had denied himself a chance to race for his third individual medal.</p>
        <p>''I tried to set up the Japanese skater on the inside,'' he said. ''I tried to hold the track and ran out of room. I knew I had a little downfall after my start. I didn't really get off that line too well, but that's alright.''</p>
        <p>This time, it was the lesser-known skater with a soul-patch, Canada's Marc Gagnon, who surged to the gold medal in the men's 500. Gagnon passed Smith on the backstretch of the final lap. His Canadian teammate, Jonathan Guilmette, won the silver medal and Smith hung on for a bronze medal.</p>
        <p>After Ohno won the gold medal in the men's 1,500 by virtue of Korea's Kim Dong Sung being disqualified, Ohno had to be accompanied by Utah state troopers because of the 16,000 death threats that the United States Olympic Committee received in its e-mail system.</p>
        <p>The Korean Olympic Committee protested, appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and was flatly denied today to have the result overturned.</p>
        <p>But tonight, in the anticipated rematch in the men's 500 meters, neither Ohno nor Kim even made it in the semifinal of the men's 500 meters, the tension defused.</p>
        <p>In the previous semifinal, Ohno's teammate, Smith made a surging pass on Kim in the second-to-last lap and then stayed ahead to finish first to qualify for the final. Gagnon of Canada edged Kim by a blade, and as only the top two qualify for the finals, Kim was out.</p>
        <p>Ohno won his silver in the 1,000 meters by crawling to the finish after being taken out in a crash, watching the slowest skater, Steven Bradbury of Australia avoid the 4-skater pileup and saunter across the finish line.</p>
