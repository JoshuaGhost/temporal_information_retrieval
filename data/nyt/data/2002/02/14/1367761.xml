        <p>Hundreds of women in the United States and Canada fell prey to a work-at-home scheme, believing they were getting paid for talking to lonely European men when they were actually speaking to other chat room operators, the New York State Consumer Protection Board reported yesterday. The women were told the calls would cost them $1 a minute but that they would be paid $1.48 a minute. Instead, they were left with large phone bills, some totaling thousands of dollars. Their nominal employer, North Star Communications, said to have headquarters in Winnipeg, went out of business and its managers disappeared, the consumer board said.</p>
