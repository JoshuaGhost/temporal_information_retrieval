        <p>BERNSTEIN - MEYEROWITZ Theresa. Painter and writer of New York City and Gloucester, MA, died peacefully on February 12, 2002, at Mt. Sinai Hospital. Date of birth reported to be March 1, 1890. She graduated from Philadelphia's School of Design for Women (now the Moore College of Art) in 1911, and moved to NYC in 1912. She married fellow painter and etcher William Meyerowitz (d. 1981) in 1919. Along with her husband and John Sloan, she helped establish The Society of Independant Artists. She also became an integral part of the Gloucester art community from 1916 until 1998, and was a founding member of The North Shore Arts Association in 1922. She was also a member of several art associations both in New York and in Massachusetts. Also known as one of the very few women to work in the Ashcan Mode, she had several very well received and successful shows in museums and galleries beginning in 1914. Noteworthy were her shows at the Museum of the City of New York in 1991, and several at Joan Whalen Fine Art, New York City, from 1998 to 2001. She is well represented in several private collections in the U.S. and in Israel. She will be greatly missed by her loving and devoted aides, Violet Sternlicht, Meggon Wilcox and Ingrid Fishman; by her devoted friends &amp; family; Suzanne Laurier, Diane Dawson, Sylvia Selfridge, The Newman Family of Long Island, Gerry Jackson, Marilyn Clark, Walter Mannenen, David Hall, Kenneth and Keith Carlson &amp; their families. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, February 17, 2002, 11:30 AM at Crestwood Memorial Chapel, 33 Spring St, NYC (212-431-6712). Her interment will follow at the New Montefiore Cemetery, Wellwood Avenue, Pine Lawn, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Visiting Doctors, Mt. Sinai Medical Center, 1470 Madison Ave, NY, NY 10029, and/or Global Children, 300 Central Park West, Apt 10B, NY, NY 10024.

        <p>BERNSTEIN - MEYEROWITZ Theresa. A woman of incredible talent, humor and great fortitude. ''Grandma,'' I will miss you very, very much. I embrace your spirit. You will be with me forever ''Schmookari.'' Suzanne Laurier</p>
