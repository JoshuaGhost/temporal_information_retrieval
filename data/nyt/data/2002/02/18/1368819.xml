        <p>More than two million e-mail accounts have became virtual milk cartons, as Qualcomm Internet Services is using its popular Eudora Mail software program to distribute a missing person ad.</p>
        <p>Since early this month, the company has sent the ad -- a photo of the 7-year-old California girl Danielle van Dam and the words ''Missing. Last Seen 2/1/02'' -- to everyone who uses the ad-supported version of Eurdora Mail.</p>
        <p>While it was not the first time Qualcomm had placed public service ads on Eudora Mail, this time the gesture hit closer to home. Damon van Dam, the missing girl's father, is an engineer under contract with Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. The van Dams live north of the city in a community called Sabre Springs.</p>
        <p>''The entire company has been very concerned,'' says Jeremy James, senior director of marketing for Qualcomm Internet Services. ''Because we had this version of Eudora that we can serve ads onto, we knew immediately that we wanted to do this for the van Dams.''</p>
        <p>Police investigators in San Diego are treating Danielle's disappearance as a kidnapping. Her parents reported her missing on Feb. 2.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm received a few negative reactions to the ad from Eudora users who found it unwelcome and upsetting, according to Mr. James. But Marissa Gluck, a senior analyst with Jupiter Research, said the negative responses were unusual. The reaction to most public service announcements is favorable.</p>
        <p>''Public service ads benefit everyone,'' Ms. Gluck said. ''The publisher wins because it's doing good things for the brand. There's really no downside unless you're supporting a controversial organization.''</p>
        <p>Before long, the issue of public service ads on Eudora Mail may no longer arise. Currently, about 20 percent of Eudora Mail's 10 million customers use the ad-supported version. But Qualcomm officials say the company may phase out that version by the end of the year, in light of the anemic online advertising market.</p>
        <p>Qualcomm, whose main business is licensing wireless technology, is also considering phasing out the $39.95 version of Eudora Mail. Because Microsoft now bundles its own e-mail program, Outlook Express, into the Windows operating system, there is little reason for consumers to pay for a separate e-mail program, Mr. James said. A free version of Eudora Mail without ads will probably remain available, he added.</p>
