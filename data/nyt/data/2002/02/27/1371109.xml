        <p>Jimmy Neeposh has been trapping beavers and martens and hunting moose and caribou along the Rupert River since he was 4 years old, his life moving with the migrations of the game on which Cree Indians have lived for centuries.</p>
        <p>Now at age 45, Mr. Neeposh faces a transformation, one that may end once and for all the remaining nomadic customs of the 13,000 Crees in the snowy northern woods of Quebec Province.</p>
        <p>The Rupert is to be flooded by a series of dams and dikes as part of a huge hydroelectric development project. Many of the traditional Cree trap lines will be sunken forever, and the fishing for walleyed pike and speckled trout will never be quite the same.</p>
        <p>''I have a very uneasy feeling about this,'' Mr. Neeposh sighed, ''but the reality of the world is changing and we have to change with it.''</p>
        <p>Resigned to the project, the Crees signed an agreement with the Quebec provincial government this month that will open their vast territory -- a third of the province -- to expanded logging, mining and hydroelectric installations.</p>
        <p>The Crees also agreed to drop $3.6 billion in environmental lawsuits, receiving in return promises of $3.5 billion in financing over 50 years, and thousands of jobs for their chronically underemployed youth.</p>
        <p>This is the first agreement in Canada's history that recognizes the full autonomy of any Indian people as a ''native nation,'' giving Quebec's Crees substantial powers to help manage mining, forestry and energy development.</p>
        <p>Top Cree chiefs negotiated in secret with the Quebec premier, Bernard Landry, to bury a long, bitter conflict over land rights. When agreement was announced last October, it shocked Quebec's nine Cree communities. Eventually, in a leap of faith that Cree jobs could be created without eating into the essence of Cree culture, nearly 70 percent of 6,500 Cree voters supported the agreement in a referendum.</p>
        <p>''Agreeing to hydroelectric development was very difficult for me,'' achnowledged the Cree grand chief, Ted Moses. ''But if you are going to gain something in negotiations you have to give something. ''</p>
        <p>Quebec's Crees have shown a strong pragmatic streak since the French and English arrived in the 17th and 18th centuries. Faced with superior military might, the Crees put aside their warrior ways, struck up a lucrative fur trading relationship with the Hudson Bay Company and adapted to Anglican Protestantism.</p>
        <p>In 1975, the Crees signed an agreement with Quebec that allowed for the flooding of hundreds of square miles of hunting lands in exchange for $232.5 million in compensation over 21 years, guaranteed incomes for Cree hunters and subsidized housing.</p>
        <p>The drowning of vast herds of caribou, flooding of ancestral grave sites, and broken promises of forestry and wildlife protection made them bitter, although leaders acknowledge that government cash brought many benefits. Now far larger sums are on the way.</p>
        <p>In a generation, the Crees have evolved from a nomadic people who lived in tepees, had arranged marriages and used dog teams into an increasingly suburban society with power tools, snowmobiles cellular telephones and computers.</p>
        <p>Few of the 470,000 people scattered across 2,250 Indian reserves in Canada have achieved the standard of living of Quebec's Crees in the last 25 years.</p>
        <p>Like most of the other Cree communities, Mistissini now looks like a working-class suburb with neat and comfortable wooden houses, an indoor hockey rink, a lighted baseball diamond, three well-equipped school buildings, two day-care centers and a modern hardware store. A large, attractive grocery store is stocked with T-bone steaks, deluxe imported coffees, fashion candles and magazines ranging from Today's Bride to Business Week.</p>
        <p>Yet the Crees have preserved important parts of their culture, and one-third of their work force still live off hunting, fishing and trapping.</p>
        <p>The 1975 agreement gave the Crees control over the local school board, which has mandated school instruction through the third grade strictly in the Cree language. Teaching in English is introduced only after that.</p>
        <p>Modern medical care has helped to double Mistissini's population, to 3,100, in the last 25 years. Sixty-five percent of the local population is under age 30 -- an explosion that has helped to produce high unemployment and alcoholism among the young, whom Cree leaders now hope to help.</p>
        <p>The Mistissini chief, John Longchap, said the new government compensation would be used to develop a lumber mill and create hundreds of jobs in retail businesses. Low-interest mortgages should also augment existing subsidies for public housing.</p>
        <p>''It's never easy to compromise on something we have always depended on like the Rupert River,'' Chief Longchap said. ''But we are reasonable people who make rational decisions even if they are not perfect.''</p>
        <p>Most Crees seem to agree, if reluctantly. Sam Edwards is a 72-year-old trapper who speaks only Cree. Interviewed in his shack, which is heated by a cast-iron stove, he noted: ''Our traditional way was hard. There were no houses and tents were cold.''</p>
        <p>He still fishes as his father taught him, draping a net under the lake ice between two poles dug through the ice cover. But he now travels to his fishing spots by snowmobile, allowing him to cast more nets over a larger territory.</p>
        <p>''Modern life is easier,'' he said, warming his water-swollen hands on a cup of coffee. ''When the hunting doesn't go well these days, we can always go to the grocery store or to restaurants.''</p>
