        <p>Every year on Feb. 26, six families have gathered at the World Trade Center to remember the victims of the first act of terrorism there, in 1993.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, at 12:18 p.m., families and friends gathered as usual for a moment of silence, remembering the six people who were killed when a truck bomb exploded in a basement garage. But instead of standing for a moment of silence at a memorial, a graceful rose granite circle carved with the victims' names, they gazed over the vast, empty ditch of ground zero. For many, it was their first sight of the World Trade Center wreckage.</p>

        <p>Every year on Feb. 26, six families have gathered at the World Trade Center to remember the victims of the first act of terrorism there, in 1993.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, at 12:18 p.m., families and friends gathered as usual for a moment of silence, remembering the six people who were killed when a truck bomb exploded in a basement garage. But instead of standing for a moment of silence at a memorial, a graceful rose granite circle carved with the victims' names, they gazed over the vast, empty ditch of ground zero. For many, it was their first sight of the World Trade Center wreckage.</p>
        <p>The sight of it, they said, magnified their grief and made them realize that the deaths nine years ago were not isolated episodes, but foreshadowings of thousands of deaths to come. For Patrick Rodriguez, whose older sister, Monica Smith, was eight months pregnant when she was killed in 1993, the deaths were not the end of the horror, but the beginning.</p>
        <p>''All those people,'' said Butch Shirtz, whose brother-in-law, Steve Knapp, was killed nine years ago. ''If there was a first time, they should have known there was going to be a last time,'' he said. ''When does it stop? And why?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Knapp, who was the chief of maintenance at the trade center, was among four employees of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey killed while they were eating lunch in the basement. The fifth victim was a salesman who had just parked in the garage when the bomb went off; the sixth, a hotel worker, was not found until 17 days later.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Shirtz, along with the other relatives, friends and colleagues of the victims, were taken to a private ramp overlooking ground zero. During the moment of silence, all work halted, construction workers removed their helmets and a bagpiper played ''Amazing Grace.'' Long after the last notes faded, Mr. Shirtz stood, eyes wet, staring at the hole. ''This is my first time here,'' he said. ''And it's going to be my last.''</p>
        <p>For Port Authority employees, past and present, this was only the latest of many memorials they have attended over the past five months. The Port Authority maintenance department at the World Trade Center was always close-knit, said Gerald Drasheff, a lawyer who used to work there and knew some of the victims in 1993. ''They were no different from the people who died last fall,'' he said. ''Regular people that got up every day and went to work. That's the shame of it. Sept. 11 eclipses this -- it eclipses everything. But for individual families, '93 was just as much of a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Some relatives, like Patrick Rodriguez, said the  Port Authority should have taken tighter security measures in 1993. Others, like Cherrie Nannings, director of real estate at the Port Authority, said the increased security and planning for evacuations  saved tens of thousands of lives on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>At a Mass of remembrance at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, a broken slab of the rose granite circle -- engraved with John, for John DiGiovanni, a victim -- was displayed in a polished wooden box. So far, it is the only relic of the memorial that has been unearthed, and the Port Authority is planning to hold onto it, and hoping to find more pieces for a future memorial, said Allen Morrison, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Alana Gilkeson, a friend of Mr. Knapp's, said the sight of ground zero multiplied the sense of loss. ''First Steve is murdered. Then we make a monument. Then Sept. 11. It's always bigger, more horrible. What we have keeps getting taken away.''</p>
