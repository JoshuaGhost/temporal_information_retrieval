        <p>A court rejected a plea by the operator of the Channel Tunnel to shut a refugee camp that it says acts as a handy starting point for immigrants trying to cross illegally to Britain. It was the second time the operator, Eurotunnel, had asked the court to shut the Sangatte camp, about a mile from the entrance of the tunnel near Calais. Eurotunnel had apparently hoped that an incident at Christmas, in which hundreds of immigrants tried to storm the tunnel, would convince the courts that emergency measures were needed.</p>
