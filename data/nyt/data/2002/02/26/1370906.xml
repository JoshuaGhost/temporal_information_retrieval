        <p>Opening what could be a rough, yearlong debate about welfare, President Bush is proposing to increase the work requirements for welfare recipients and push the states harder to meet them.</p>
        <p>The administration, which already unveiled part of its plan to overhaul the landmark 1996 welfare law, plans to announce its proposals on Tuesday. Mr. Bush told the nation's governors meeting here today that he would ask Congress to approve new work requirements but would also seek to give states the flexibility to meet the needs of people who need training or drug abuse treatment.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bush said, ''work ought to be the core of welfare reform.''</p>
        <p>In an excerpt from an advance text of his speech, Mr. Bush declares: ''We are encouraged by the initial results of welfare reform, but we are not content. We ended welfare as we've known it, yet this is not a post-poverty America. Child poverty is still too high, too many families are strained and fragile and broken -- too many Americans still have not found work and the purpose it brings. Because these needs continue, our work is not done.''</p>
        <p>At least 50 percent of a state's welfare families must now participate in work and other activities aimed at self-sufficiency; Mr. Bush proposes to raise that requirement so that 70 percent must be working by 2007. Administration officials also said they hoped to close loopholes that render the work requirement, in some cases, largely meaningless.</p>
        <p>The administration plans to require welfare recipients to work 40 hours a week ''at a job or in programs designed to help them achieve independence.'' Adults are now generally required to work 30 hours a week, of which no more 10 could be in job training or education programs.</p>
        <p>A fact sheet released by the administration tonight said that the plan would ''make special accommodations for parents with infants and individuals who need substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation or special work-related training.''</p>
        <p>Gov. John Engler, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the National Governors' Association, and Gov. Paul E. Patton, the Kentucky Democrat who is the group's vice chairman, said governors were generally pleased with what they learned about the plan, though details were tightly held until tonight.</p>
        <p>But advocates for low-income people were already starting to mobilize against the plan.</p>
        <p>''It's almost welfare reform in Wonderland,'' said Deepak Bhargava, director of the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, a group seeking to liberalize the welfare law. ''We're in the middle of a recession. Now is a strange time to be arguing we ought to toughen work requirements on poor families.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the Bush plan would allow for creative combinations of job training, education and work. Increasing poor people's opportunities for training -- and thus moving up the economic ladder -- is a primary goal for Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill this year.</p>
        <p>Douglas J. Besharov, a welfare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said combining tougher work requirements with more training possibilities permitted the administration ''to go left and right at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposals come as Congress begins to review the 1996 law, much of which expires this year. That law abolished entitlements for cash assistance for poor families, replacing them with block grants to states and new work requirements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush plans to argue, aides said, that the 1996 law was an unalloyed success. He will also, aides said, try to refute the idea -- held by some welfare experts -- that the booming economy was the most important factor in the substantial drop in welfare cases in recent years.</p>
        <p>The aides also said Mr. Bush considered welfare legislation a primary goal this year, and many analysts have suggested it may be one of the few major measures that could pass in this intensely political year.</p>
        <p>In their fact sheet, Bush officials said they would seek to extend the existing five-year ban on federal welfare benefits for immigrants who entered the United States after 1996 and have not become citizens.</p>
        <p>The fact sheet also said the administration would direct ''up to $300 million'' for programs aimed at ''encouraging healthy, stable marriages.'' That included a $100 million fund for experimental programs on marriage training at the state level that had been previously announced.</p>
        <p>The administration indicated it would give states the ''flexibility to streamline and coordinate'' support programs like food stamps and child care that help poor families with the transition from welfare to work.</p>
        <p>Though the law stipulates that half the adults on a state's welfare rolls be working, the requirement's significance has been eroded by another provision of the law. A state that has cut its welfare caseload since 1995 is given credit toward meeting the work requirement. In many states, the caseload has shrunk so much that they are no longer subject to a significant work requirement for those people remaining on welfare. Bush aides said they wanted Congress to impose more meaningful work requirements.</p>
        <p>This year, as in 1996, Republicans and moderate Democrats may find areas of agreement. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, said: ''Philosophically, the president is heading in the right direction. We need to make sure that the tools are there for people to meet the work requirements, and that states have some flexibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bayh said he and Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, were writing a bill that would gradually raise work requirements.</p>
        <p>Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a leading Democratic expert on welfare, said he could not evaluate Mr. Bush's proposal without more information, which the White House has yet to provide.</p>
        <p>''The acceptability of the increase in work requirements will depend on whether states have adequate flexibility to combine work with the training necessary for people to move up the ladder and achieve financial security and independence,'' Mr. Levin  said.</p>
