        <p>Singapore Telecommunications said net profit in the last three months of 2001 fell 56 percent, to 290.3 million Singapore dollars ($158.5 million), on expenses related to its $7 billion purchase of the Australian operator Cable and Wireless Optus as well as rising competition and a recession at home. The company said sales in its fiscal third quarter nearly doubled to 2.42 billion Singapore dollars, thanks to contributions from Optus, now known as SingTel Optus. Sales in Singapore fell 1.6 percent, to 1.21 billion Singapore dollars.</p>
