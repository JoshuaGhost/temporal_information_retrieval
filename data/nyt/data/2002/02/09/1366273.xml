        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Testimony From Enron Executives Is Contradictory'' (front page, Feb. 8):</p>
        <p>The Congressional testimony of Enron executives reads like an assault on American capitalism: four took the Fifth Amendment; many could not recollect; and all made millions while the company's 401(k) participants were wiped out.</p>
        <p>If Enron executives had any sense of decency and fair play, they would pool their ill-gotten gains into an ''Enron 401(k) Relief Fund'' for the benefit of the victims. The millions upon millions received would then be divided up among the 401(k) participants in proportion to each one's contribution.</p>
        <p>By so doing, some of the shame of the scandal might be removed from the executives, and showing concern for their fellow employees might help correct the damage they have inflicted on America's capitalist system.</p>
