        <p>NEWARK, Feb. 22 Â— The councilman seeking to unseat Mayor Sharpe James asked state election officials today to investigate whether the mayor was improperly using municipal funds to buy campaign advertisements that masquerade as public service announcements.</p>

        <p>The councilman seeking to unseat Mayor Sharpe James asked state election officials today to investigate whether the mayor was improperly using municipal funds to buy campaign advertisements that masquerade as public service announcements.</p>
        <p>The councilman, Cory Booker,  asked the State Election Law Enforcement Commission to review billboards, pamphlets and television commercials that have appeared in recent weeks prominently featuring the mayor, said Aney Chandy, a lawyer for Mr. Booker's campaign.</p>
        <p>According to the formal complaint that was filed today, Mr. James's ads violate election law because they use public money to promote a candidate and fail to identify the source of the money.</p>
        <p>The ads mentioned in the complaint include billboards featuring a photograph of the mayor with four nurses. The text says, ''Mayor Sharpe James welcomes public health nurses back into our community,'' followed by the words ''friendly, compassionate, professional.''</p>
        <p>The filing also criticized a televised announcement that used the mayor to promote the city's gun buyback program and a public safety pamphlet mailed to households across the city that included photographs of the mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Booker said he found the timing and cost of the mayor's public service campaigns troubling. ''At a time when Newark is ranked the fourth-worst city to raise children in, it is unfortunate that the mayor is using precious public money in such a brash, political way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mayor's spokeswoman, Pamela Goldstein, said the advertisements were part of longstanding public service campaigns. ''When you are an incumbent elected official, you have that office behind you,'' she said. ''Sharpe James is the mayor of Newark until noon of July 1, and hopefully thereafter.''</p>
        <p>The nonpartisan election on May 14 will pit Mr. James, one of the nation's longest-serving big city mayors, against Mr. Booker, a political newcomer who has gained prominence for his media-friendly crusades against crime and drugs.</p>
        <p>First elected 16 years ago, Mr. James faces a serious challenge in Mr. Booker, an aggressive fund-raiser who has so far collected about $1.4 million, $400,000 less than his opponent. For his part, Mr. Booker began airing a flood of television commercials on cable last week.</p>
