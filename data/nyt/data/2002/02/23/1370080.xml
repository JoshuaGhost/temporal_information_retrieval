        <p>SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 22  Near the conclusion of this dreary game today, a group of young men wearing Canadian hockey jerseys rose to their feet from their seats near the Belarus net and added a little noise to the E Center arena by singing their country's national anthem.

        <p>Near the conclusion of this dreary game today, a group of young men wearing Canadian hockey jerseys rose to their feet from their seats near the Belarus net and added a little noise to the E Center arena by singing their country's national anthem. They were celebrating Canada's 7-1 victory over Belarus in a men's hockey semifinal and also a berth in the gold medal game on Sunday against the United States.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if we'll win Sunday, but we're there,'' Canada Coach Pat Quinn said. ''We plan on it.''</p>
        <p>After starting the tournament in ragged fashion with a 1-1-1 record in the previous round, the Canadians have gradually improved. They beat Finland, 2-1, in the quarterfinals. And because Belarus upset Sweden, 4-3, in the quarterfinals, the Canadian opponent today was the weakest contender remaining. ''Their tank was pretty dry today,'' Canada's Brendan Shanahan said of Belarus.</p>
        <p>Steve Yzerman, Eric Brewer, Scott Niedermayer, Paul Kariya, Simon Gagné, Eric Lindros and Jarome Iginla scored for Canada. Ruslan Salei, the only N.H.L. player on the Belarus roster, scored at 13 minutes 24 seconds of the first period to tie the score, briefly, at 1-1. But the Canadians went ahead to stay at 17:25 on Brewer's goal off Yzerman's setup from behind the net. They held the advantage in shots, 51-14, dominated play territorially and wore down Belarus with hard checking and superior speed.</p>
        <p>''It means a lot,'' Canada's Mario Lemieux said. ''It means a whole lot to the whole country.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur made 13 saves for Canada, missing only Salei's long shot when it bounced off his glove. Lindros, the Rangers' star, played the full game today after missing the third period in Wednesday night's 2-1 victory over Finland. He was aggressive throughout and took penalties for slashing and unsportsmanlike conduct in the late minutes for altercations with Vladimir Tsyplakov, who was also penalized.</p>
        <p>Because Belarus has played all the top teams, Salei was asked which opponent he thought was the strongest. ''I thought Sweden was the best,'' said Salei, who plays for Anaheim in the N.H.L. ''I guess they weren't. I guess they're pretty much the same. It's all about one day.''</p>
