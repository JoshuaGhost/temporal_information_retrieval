        <p>Five Buddies From Britain</p>
        <p>Fred Schepisi (pronounced SKEP-see), the Australian-born director whose filmography includes ''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,'' ''Iceman'' and ''Roxanne,'' hasn't had a movie of his own in theatrical release since the disappointing ''I.Q.'' in 1994. But now Mr. Schepisi, 62, is back with ''Last Orders,'' which opens today (review, Page 1 of Weekend). It's a moving adaptation of Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel about a group of four old pub mates from South London (Bob Hoskins, Tom Courtenay, Ray Winstone and David Hemmings) on their way to dispose of the ashes of a fifth (played by Michael Caine in the film's lengthy flashbacks).</p>

        <p>Five Buddies From Britain</p>
        <p>Fred Schepisi (pronounced SKEP-see), the Australian-born director whose filmography includes ''The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,'' ''Iceman'' and ''Roxanne,'' hasn't had a movie of his own in theatrical release since the disappointing ''I.Q.'' in 1994. But now Mr. Schepisi, 62, is back with ''Last Orders,'' which opens today (review, Page 1 of Weekend). It's a moving adaptation of Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel about a group of four old pub mates from South London (Bob Hoskins, Tom Courtenay, Ray Winstone and David Hemmings) on their way to dispose of the ashes of a fifth (played by Michael Caine in the film's lengthy flashbacks).</p>
        <p>''I was going to do 'Don Quixote' onstage with Robin Williams as Sancho Panza and John Cleese as Don Quixote,'' Mr. Schepisi said. ''I knew it was going to be a fantastic thing. But it got killed, unfortunately, as did quite a few other things I've worked on over the last few years.''</p>
        <p>Those other things included an earlier adaptation of ''The Shipping News,'' with John Travolta in the leading role, and a murder mystery to star Julianne Moore and William Macy from a script by Mr. Schepisi. ''And there were a couple of others, I suppose,'' he recalled with a sigh.</p>
        <p>''The world shifted,'' Mr. Schepisi said. ''I used to be able to make movies within the studio system. But now everything is either very expensive, high-concept stuff or very cheap.''</p>
        <p>''If I were making 'Six Degrees of Separation' now,'' he added, referring to his successful 1993 adaptation of John Guare's play, ''I would only get about half the amount of money I got to do it, and it wouldn't -- it couldn't -- be the same film. It would have to be scaled down to such an extent that it wouldn't be a movie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schepisi produced the moderately budgeted ($9 million) ''Last Orders'' himself. ''The sheer joy of this film for me,'' he said, ''is that I got to do exactly what I wanted to do. I was able to fully give of myself and take advantage of the great actors I had and all the other talents working with me. We'll see if I can afford it.''</p>
        <p>Captivity Recaptured</p>
        <p>Gregory Hoblit was on his way to present his new film, ''Hart's War,'' to the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but took a few minutes to talk about his new movie over a cup of tea -- ''something caffeinated, please,'' he said -- at a sleek hotel on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoblit has been making theatrical films for five years, including ''Frequency'' and ''Fallen''; before that, he was one of Steven Bochco's most trusted directors on Mr. Bochco's hit television series ''Hill Street Blues,'' ''NYPD Blue'' and ''L.A. Law.'' ''This one,'' he said, ''I think by virtue of it having a real place in history, and not being some fanciful story that could have been told any time, any place, this one has a real root to it. It was about things I was interested in.''</p>
        <p>Set in a German prisoner-of-war camp during the darkest days of World War II, ''Hart's War'' is a combat film in which most of the struggles are interior -- Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell), a captured United States flier, must decide whether to live up to his law school ideals or sacrifice them to the demands of a plot being hatched by a senior American officer, William McNamara (Bruce Willis).</p>
        <p>''It was becoming clear to me after reading 'The Greatest Generation' and hearing a lot of the men who fought in that war speak in documentaries and such, that that generation is passing,'' Mr. Hoblit said. ''In 10 years, we may no longer have first-person accounts of this war.''</p>
        <p>The film, which opens today (review, Page 19), is based on a novel by John Katzenbach, whose father, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach (President Lyndon B. Johnson's attorney general), had been a prisoner of war.  ''I was two weeks into the shooting when Nicholas Katzenbach came over to the set in the Czech Republic,'' Mr. Hoblit said. ''To see the look on his face when he got out of his car and looked at the place and walked into the barracks -- it just all came flooding back to him. I was very proud on behalf of everybody on the film, because it felt right to him; everything from the barbed wire to the look of the bunks in the barracks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoblit cast both Edward Norton (''Primal Fear'') and James Caviezel (''Frequency'') in their first leading roles; his flair for casting hasn't abandoned him on ''Hart's War,'' which features the young Irish actor Colin Farrell standing on the brink of what many in Hollywood assume will be a major career. ''I had a pretty good sense that the goods were sitting across that table from me when I first met him, '' Mr. Hoblit declared.</p>
        <p>Troupers to Troopers</p>
        <p>When Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske started performing together as undergraduates at Colgate University, they called their improvisational comedy group Charred Goosebeak.</p>
        <p>Later, when they started making it in New York comedy clubs, they changed their name to the infinitely more commercial Broken Lizard -- which is how they are billed in ''Super Troopers,'' the group's second feature film but the first to go into wide release. Today it opens in 1,500 theaters, an unusually high number for an independent film (review, Page 19).</p>
        <p>''What happened,'' recalled Mr. Chandrasekhar, the group's director, ''was that we were performing at the Duplex in the West Village for about three years, and I decided to take a class at N.Y.U., a basic 16-millimeter production class, and learned how to load a camera and edit. So that's how we took the leap into movies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandrasekhar emphasized that the film, about a gang of anarchic, fun-loving Vermont state troopers, is not an improvisational exercise. ''We wrote 25 drafts of the script,'' he said. ''There's no doubt that we're going for pure comedy, but we're also trying to make films more in line with certain John Landis films, like 'The Blues Brothers.' ''</p>
        <p>''Super Troopers'' was screened at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and was snapped up by Fox Searchlight, the specialized division of 20th Century Fox. ''Once we saw it with an audience,'' Mr. Chandrasekhar said, ''we said, 'yeah, it's really working, but we could probably lose seven minutes with a little nip and a little tuck here and there.' And Fox put us with this editor named George Folsey. At first we were like, 'Who is this guy?' But when we looked at his résumé, we realized that he was our hero without our ever having heard of him.'' Mr. Folsey's credits include ''The Blues Brothers,'' as well as many other John Landis comedies.</p>
        <p>''Folsey told us that the most important thing in making an anti-authoritarian comedy was to make sure that the audience likes the characters and that the characters like each other,'' Mr. Chandrasekhar said, adding, ''If they buy into that, then you can do whatever you want to the rest of the world.''</p>
