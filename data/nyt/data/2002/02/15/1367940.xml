        <p>Hitting yet another snag in its nascent Internet service, the Comcast Corporation said yesterday that it was scrambling to repair an e-mail failure that had left as many as 300,000 customers unable to receive messages.</p>
        <p>Starting at 10 p.m. Wednesday, customers were able to receive e-mail messages intermittently, but by noon yesterday, they were unable to receive them at all, said Dave Watson, executive vice president for marketing at Comcast. Mr. Watson said the company hoped to restore full e-mail service by late last night, but, if not, would ''work around the clock'' to do so.</p>

        <p>Hitting yet another snag in its nascent Internet service, the Comcast Corporation said yesterday that it was scrambling to repair an e-mail failure that had left as many as 300,000 customers unable to receive messages.</p>
        <p>Starting at 10 p.m. Wednesday, customers were able to receive e-mail messages intermittently, but by noon yesterday, they were unable to receive them at all, said Dave Watson, executive vice president for marketing at Comcast. Mr. Watson said the company hoped to restore full e-mail service by late last night, but, if not, would ''work around the clock'' to do so.</p>
        <p>This is just the latest stumble for Comcast, a cable operator that provides high-speed Internet access to about 950,000 customers. Until last year, Comcast provided the service in partnership with Excite@Home, but when Excite@Home went bankrupt, Comcast set out to build its own Internet network.</p>
        <p>Initially, Comcast infuriated many Internet subscribers, particularly in the New Jersey and Detroit areas, who said they could not get access to e-mail and the Web. Then, earlier this week, the company faced criticism from privacy advocates, who said Comcast was tracking subscriber Internet traffic patterns in a way that could allow it to follow individual surfing habits. Comcast announced on Wednesday that it would modify its practices.</p>
        <p>In the latest trouble, Mr. Watson said, the company had a problem with its e-mail distribution servers, which are powerful computers responsible for distributing to individual users the e-mail messages received by the Comcast system. Mr. Watson said the servers had continued to receive incoming mail and were storing it for distribution when the technical problem was solved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watson said the problem affected only users who relied on a Comcast e-mail account, and that subscribers who relied on a different service, like a residual one from @Home, were unaffected.</p>
        <p>In a larger sense, Mr. Watson said the problems for Comcast are a result of the effort to deploy an Internet service in very short order. ''These are early-stage issues,'' he said, noting that other Internet companies have faced similar problems. ''But that's not an excuse for us.''</p>
        <p>The problems also hark back to legal arguments made by Excite@Home when it went bankrupt. Excite@Home sought to put pressure on its cable partners, like Comcast and AT&amp;T, to pay more for its service, arguing that they were underestimating the difficulty and expense of operating an Internet network.</p>
