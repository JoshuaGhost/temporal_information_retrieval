        <p>The Bloomberg administration said yesterday that it was exploring placing tolls on city-controlled bridges on the East River and perhaps others.

        <p>The Bloomberg administration said yesterday that it was exploring placing tolls on city-controlled bridges on the East River and perhaps others. An idea that has been proposed by mayors several times before, it seems to be gaining momentum as a way to help cure the city's ailing finances.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not mention the idea when he presented his budget plan, but deep within it -- in a section explaining sources of money that the city hoped to tap in the next few years -- the administration included $800 million expected by 2006 from ''congestion pricing'' and ''E-ZPass initiatives.''</p>
        <p>While administration officials stressed that they were still in the early stages of discussion, they said that money could come from a range of new charges to drivers.</p>
        <p>Clearly the most prominent plan for generating the money -- and the one that the Bloomberg administration was most reluctant to talk about yesterday -- would place tolls on the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges, and possibly other bridges under the city's control (like those on the Harlem River).</p>
        <p>The measure, city officials said, would probably require approval from both the City Council and the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>''Everything is under consideration,'' said Jordan Barowitz, a mayoral spokesman, when asked about the budget projections.</p>
        <p>Tolls on the East River crossings have long been supported by many traffic experts, who say that they would reduce excessive traffic into Manhattan, prompt more people to take public transportation and generate badly needed income for the maintenance of the city's streets and bridges. Other pieces of the plan, officials said, could entail higher parking rates at meters across the city during high-traffic times, a practice known as congestion pricing, which is intended to encourage drivers to use roads earlier in the day, or later.</p>
        <p>Another idea to accomplish that, and to raise money for the city, would be higher tolls on bridges and tunnels controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority during peak travel periods. Under one concept being discussed, some of the toll money would then go to the city, in part because the cars using those crossings during high-traffic times are costing the city money for road repair, traffic and environmental controls and other services.</p>
        <p>Privately, administration officials said that some details about the plans would probably be released in April, when more information about the mayor's budget proposal will be made available. A senior official described the new toll proposal as being ''on the table as something we want to start to discuss.''</p>
        <p>Charging cars for using the city's free bridges was first proposed in 1973, as a way for the city to comply with federal requirements that it reduce its car pollution.</p>
        <p>But the idea, which has always been approached by elected officials with a great deal of trepidation, was dropped by Gov. Hugh L. Carey, after the federal government allowed the state to comply by showing that it would use all available financial sources to meet basic public transportation needs. The idea was revived under Mayor Edward I. Koch, who hoped that bridge tolls and a $10-a-day fee on all vehicles entering Manhattan south of 59th Street would discourage unnecessary driving as well as gridlock, which damaged both the city's economy and environment.</p>
        <p>During the administration of David N. Dinkins, a mayoral commission proposed East River tolls to help the mayor deal with the city's long-term budget problems. But Mr. Dinkins never supported the idea.</p>
        <p>In his campaign position papers, Mr. Bloomberg said that he supported the concept of congestion pricing, which uses tolls and parking charges to change people's travel habits and to try to speed out the flow of traffic more evenly over the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg has continued, in the emergency orders he issues every five days as part of the World Trade Center cleanup, to impose a ban on driver-only vehicles crossing into parts of Manhattan in the morning, a restriction started after enormous congestion in the days following the attack. But it is clear this time that city officials are moving cautiously on tolls, especially given that it is a gubernatorial election year when Mr. Bloomberg's fellow Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki, could face angry voters if he supported new tolls.</p>
        <p>While administration officials say that all the ideas are being considered -- including deriving some income from parking fees and from the M.T.A. -- several transportation experts said that the kind of money projected in the mayor's budget plan -- $100 million starting in 2004, rising to $800 million by 2006 -- could only be gained from placing tolls on the busy bridges.</p>
        <p>''If transportation policy were based on doing the right thing, these tolls would have been started 40 or 50 years ago,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a transportation watchdog group. ''But politically, this has always been a very heavy lift.''</p>
