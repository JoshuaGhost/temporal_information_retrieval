        <p>Investors may have been astonished to learn that the Enron Corporation allowed its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, to wear two hats. But Wall Street insiders could have shrugged and said, ''Is that all?''</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the biggest and most successful firms routinely play a variety of roles and simultaneously serve several, and often conflicting, interests. In some cases, the same firms that privately sold shares in the complex partnerships that Enron kept off its balance sheet also lent Enron money and recommended Enron's stock and bonds to the public.</p>
        <p>A report by a special committee of Enron's board found that the accounting for those partnerships -- some of which were run by Mr. Fastow while he was chief financial officer -- was one cause of the company's collapse. Congressional investigators are asking whether the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was blinded to that conflict by the consulting fees Enron was paying it.</p>
        <p>While the large accounting firms rush to eliminate their apparent conflicts, executives on Wall Street are standing behind the securities laws that have perpetuated theirs. Unless Congress or securities regulators tell them otherwise, the big securities firms intend to continue raising money for corporations by selling stocks, bonds and shares in partnerships to the full spectrum of investors, from the most sophisticated millionaires to the novices.</p>
        <p>''There are inherent conflicts of interest in this business,'' said James Wiggins, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm. ''It's a question of how you manage them.''</p>
        <p>Like many major firms on Wall Street, Merrill helped to finance Enron's rapid rise. The firm managed sales of the company's bonds, lined up buyers for one big partnership run by Mr. Fastow and even collected a fee for advising another company on its purchase of a utility that Enron sold.</p>
        <p>At times, including last fall, Merrill's stock research department advised brokerage customers to buy Enron's stock. Donato J. Eassey, an analyst who followed Enron for Merrill until December, was recommending the stock after Merrill successfully sold $349 million of shares in LJM2, a partnership created by Enron executives, through a private offering. Several Merrill investment bankers, including Thomas Davis, now a vice chairman of the firm, bought shares of that partnership for themselves, though their interest was not disclosed to Merrill's customers. So far, they have recovered slightly more than 90 percent of the money they invested, according to a person close to the partnership.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that Merrill's investment bankers or executives ever considered these various roles an unacceptable conflict of interest. To the contrary, Merrill's two top executives reassured the firm's employees last week about the firm's role in selling LJM2.</p>
        <p>In an internal memorandum on Jan. 30, Merrill's chief executive, David H. Komansky, and its president, E. Stanley O'Neal, said: ''We placed it privately with a limited number of qualified institutional and individual investors who received full disclosure about its structure. Co-investment by Merrill Lynch and some of our qualified employees is common in these kinds of placements and does not represent a conflict of interest. Indeed, it directly aligns our interests with the sophisticated investors who join us in putting their capital at risk.''</p>
        <p>If Merrill's bankers, as agents of Enron, gathered any information about Enron that was not available to the company's shareholders or bondholders, they would have been barred from sharing it, experts in securities law said. That information belongs to the client and is available to the investment bankers under strict terms of confidentiality.</p>
        <p>''Investment bankers are not going to blow the whistle on transactions blessed by the company's lawyers and accountants,'' said Joseph McLaughlin, a partner with the law firm of Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood. ''You can't release the information without the company's permission.''</p>
        <p>If bankers learned something negative in preparing to manage a private placement for a public company, he said, ''what that calls for is a frank discussion with the company'' to encourage its executive to disclose the information publicly.</p>
        <p>But if the company chooses not to tell investors everything -- as Enron clearly did not -- that arrangement can leave the securities firm in an awkward position. Its analysts and brokers may be promoting stocks that they would not like so much if they knew what some of their co-workers in the investment-banking department knew.</p>
        <p>Securities firms long ago became comfortable with the potential for such conflicts. They have been playing the dual roles of corporate underwriter and financial adviser for decades.</p>
        <p>''Conflicts of interest in the financial industry are as inevitable as death and taxes,'' said John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University. ''You can't wholly purge them.''</p>
        <p>The most likely moves to deal with those conflicts, Mr. Coffee and other experts said, will be to insulate analysts even more from their investment-banking counterparts. Rather than allowing the two sides to share more information, regulators will probably try to limit the bankers' ability to influence the analysts' ratings and views on securities that their firms underwrite.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Wall Street executives are likely to resist calls for change. It is an industry with codes of conduct that do not prevent an investment bank from representing both the buyer and the seller in a merger. ''It's taken an incredible perfect storm to force the auditing industry to change,'' Mr. Coffee said. ''I don't think we're going to see Wall Street fundamentally change how it behaves.''</p>
