        <p>AMERICA'S trauma has turned it toward the familiar, the reassuring, the warmth of family and of food fondly remembered. This return to roots is reflected at restaurants as well, in eating places like Giovanna's of Bay Shore. This three-month-old traditional Italian restaurant, at 70 Park Avenue (631-206-4848), is dedicated to Giovanna Tassa, born in Naples in 1916, and Anna Dennis of New York City, circa 1906. It is owned and operated by their families, longtime Bay Shore-area residents, who use a number of their clan's Old World recipes.</p>
        <p>Giovanna's, with its nostalgic pictures of old Bay Shore and its fireplace and candles is a homey, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-eat kind of restaurant. Its dishes are designed to envelope diners, not challenge them.  Its owners strain to offer every manner of inducements: a three-course $21 Sunday night dinner, a Tuesday night $15 pasta meal, jazz on Wednesdays, a Friday 4 to 7 p.m. happy hour with a free buffet, ''speed lunches'' for businesspeople and call-ahead takeout lunches.</p>

        <p>AMERICA'S trauma has turned it toward the familiar, the reassuring, the warmth of family and of food fondly remembered. This return to roots is reflected at restaurants as well, in eating places like Giovanna's of Bay Shore. This three-month-old traditional Italian restaurant, at 70 Park Avenue (631-206-4848), is dedicated to Giovanna Tassa, born in Naples in 1916, and Anna Dennis of New York City, circa 1906. It is owned and operated by their families, longtime Bay Shore-area residents, who use a number of their clan's Old World recipes.</p>
        <p>Giovanna's, with its nostalgic pictures of old Bay Shore and its fireplace and candles is a homey, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-eat kind of restaurant. Its dishes are designed to envelope diners, not challenge them.  Its owners strain to offer every manner of inducements: a three-course $21 Sunday night dinner, a Tuesday night $15 pasta meal, jazz on Wednesdays, a Friday 4 to 7 p.m. happy hour with a free buffet, ''speed lunches'' for businesspeople and call-ahead takeout lunches.</p>
        <p>Giovanna's is a noisy, congenial relaxing sort of spot. For conventional eaters, it's a no-surprise dream, the quintessential neighborhood hangout. The gelato ($7) and sorbet ($6) are from Italy. There's glass atop the checkered-cloth-covered tables, and the house wine can be ordered for $4.50 a glass and $18 a bottle. The rigatoni, risotto, ravioli, penne, pizza, calamari crowd will find all their favorites here.</p>
        <p>Giovanna's also has most of the strengths and weaknesses of its ilk.  Diners are greeted by a basket of cheese twists and terrific soft sour-dough rolls, but appetizers often take time to make an appearance and servers are sometimes vague about where to put them down.</p>
        <p>A crisp, paper-thin ''pizza funghi'' ($5), loaded with musky mushrooms and bursting with flavor, is a prime pick. An herb-marinated, grilled vegetable plate ($6.50) passed muster, but its promised topping of Gorgonzola was missing and the fried calamari ($6.50), accompanied by an explosive fra diavolo sauce, was rubbery. The clean, crunchy hill of mizzuna greens in the Gorgonzola salad ($7), combined with grilled portobello mushrooms, roasted tomatoes and plenty of cheese, deserves special attention.</p>
        <p>The soups ($5) -- split, pasta e fagioli with wall-to-wall pasta, beans and tomatoes -- were dense with flavor as well. But a bowl of rich potato leek desperately needed seasoning.</p>
        <p>Main-course notables were a rustic rectangle of lasagna ($13) with handmade pasta and house-made meat sauce; and a robust, yet light and fluffy gnocchi Bolognese ($17); a special of creamy, carefully cooked risotto ($23) with a substantial cluster of lobster meat; and chicken Marsala ($17), a crisp-surfaced, boneless half-chicken, juicy at its core and covered by an earthy mushroom Marsala sauce.</p>
        <p>Less successful was a spaghetti with mussels and calamari entree on the prix-fixe, bogged down by a bland, watery red sauce, and salmon pavé ($20) that was past its peak of freshness.</p>
        <p>The gelato, especially the intense chocolate, is one of the better sweets.  The bitter chocolate mousse cake ($6) that's more mousse than cake is worth ordering, and the velvety tiramisù will satisfy those who, like me, want chocolate, not coffee, to be its dominant flavor.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>The Setauket Pastaria, an 82-seat storefront at 4087 Route 347 in East Setauket (631-476-8600), opened last month. Gary Viglione, the chef, transferred to the new restaurant from the eight-month-old Medford Pastaria.  He also worked at Pasta Pasta, a similar spot in Port Jefferson. Both pastarias are owned by John Faccara and, with the exception of two or three steaks, offer à la carte menu entrees in the under $20 category.</p>
        <p>Setauket Pastaria, on the site of a former pizza parlor, features walls of brick, wood and hand-painted murals of Italian scenes.</p>
        <p>Closings</p>
        <p>Allen &amp; Company, an American steakhouse at 670 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge.</p>
        <p>Potpourri</p>
        <p>Two of the Island's highest-rated restaurants are opening for lunch. Panama Hatties, at 872 East Jericho Turnpike in Huntington Station (631-351-1727), is serving a $31 three-course meal Mondays through Fridays, and starting on Feb. 18 the Bayport House, 291 Bayport Avenue, Bayport (631-472-2444), will offer a three-course $20 meal Monday to Friday.</p>
