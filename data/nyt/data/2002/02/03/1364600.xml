        <p>FOR months after the attack on the World Trade Center, Krishna Moorthy's family held out hope that he had survived the collapse of the south tower, where he had worked as a computer programmer for Fiduciary Trust Company.</p>
        <p>What had nourished his family's hope was a sign-in sheet at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, where a clerk had entered his name on the night of Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>But all that ended several weeks ago when a police officer in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., showed up at their apartment with a notification from the New York City Medical Examiner's office: DNA testing of a body part found at the site indicated that the 59-year-old Mr. Moorthy was dead.</p>
        <p>Last week, even as his wife, Saradha, 52; son, Sriram, 28; and daughter, Anitha, 23, were making plans for a funeral ceremony at a Hindu temple hall in Queens, they still could not believe he was dead.</p>
        <p>''I don't know when we'll come to that point,'' said Ms. Moorthy, who interrupted her studies in public health at Harvard to press the search for her father. ''But it's pretty final.''</p>
        <p>Hospital officials in Hoboken had told Ms. Moorthy they had no other record of ever having treated him. None of the staff members on duty that hectic day could recall seeing him. It had been a mistake, they concluded. Someone, perhaps a relative or co-worker, had called the hospital looking for Mr. Moorthy, and his name ended up on the sign-in sheet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moorthy, who will probably find a job before resuming work on her master's degree in September, said: ''It's a pretty disappointing outcome, not completely shocking, I suppose. But nonetheless, I just can't believe it. And I still have no idea what that whole hospital thing was. It remains a mystery.''</p>
