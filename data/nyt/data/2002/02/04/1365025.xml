        <p>As the Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was embraced at the World Economic Forum in New York as a standout leader willing to accept American troops to fight terrorists, influential critics at home persisted  over the weekend in asking what the Americans would really be doing.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the concern is this: Will the Americans be fighting? And with the Filipino sensitivity about sovereignty, under whose command will the Americans be?</p>
        <p>The issue is so vexing that the two governments have been unable to work out the ''terms of reference,'' which spell out the conditions and chain of command under which the Americans will operate.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has singled out Mrs. Arroyo as the kind of Asian leader they like, someone who  enthusiastically joined their expanding war on terror. She was the first in Southeast Asia, the region that has become the new focus, to agree to accept American troops.</p>
        <p>Even with the ''terms of reference'' unfinished, American soldiers continued to arrive in the Philippines over the weekend. They are to help eliminate a band of Islamic militants, the Abu Sayyaf, who are holding two American missionaries, Martin and Gracia Burnham, hostage on Basilan Island. The Bush administration has cast the mission as a training exercise in which 650 soldiers, including 150 Special Forces, will advise the Philippine Army on how to fight the group.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Constitution forbids foreign combat troops, and the government stresses that the Americans will only be advisers. Most of the American troops will train at a base near the city of Zamboanga, across the waterway from Basilan.</p>
        <p>But Special Forces will accompany Filipino soldiers into Basilan's jungle combat zones. Under Pentagon rules, the Americans will be armed and allowed to shoot in self-defense. The Special Forces commander in the Pacific, Brig. Gen. Donald C. Wurster, stressed over the weekend that his troops would indeed be going into fighting areas. ''I would not underestimate the fact there are going to be American Special Forces that are accompanying Filipino commanders and their units into dangerous places,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A former chief of the Philippine armed forces, Gen. Rudolfo Biazon, said today that the Americans' objectives in the effort were inconsistent. General Biazon, now chairman of the Senate defense committee, has called a hearing for Tuesday. A group of lawyers also petitioned the Supreme Court to stop the American troops on the grounds that the plans violated the constitutional ban on foreign troops taking part in combat.</p>
        <p>''They say this is purely a training exercise,'' General Biazon said. ''But the Americans are putting themselves in a real combat zone, with the real objectives the recovery of the Burnhams and the elimination of Abu Sayyaf. And they will have real ammunition.''</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials have said that two Special Forces soldiers will accompany each Philippine company of 70 to 100 soldiers as they pursue the rebels. American officials describe Abu Sayyaf as having links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>Members of the Arroyo government have said that Philippine commanders will be in control. The deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, Lt. Gen. Narciso L. Abaya, said: ''They will not be joint operations. There will be operations of Filipino troops with American advisers.'' But General Biazon questioned draft provisions that an American commander could take ''unilateral action'' when Philippine forces were ''not able'' or ''unwilling'' to ''adequately remove the threat.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the United States Pacific Command, Maj. Sean Gibson, said today that American troops would not be under the command of the Philippine military. If American soldiers went into Basilan combat zones, he said, it would be ''to assess the training.''</p>
        <p>In remarks at the ceremony last Thursday formally starting the operation, Secretary of Defense Angelo T. Reyes characterized the inherent quandary in the situation: ''In exercises with our American allies we have zealously seen to it that our sovereignty is preserved. Our American allies understand and respect this. Our American allies, on the other hand, retain their sovereignty even while they are on our soil. We understand and respect this.''</p>
        <p>To get around semantics, the Philippine government has disavowed the word ''joint'' and spurned a suggestion to call the exercises ''Freedom Eagle.'' Instead, they will be called ''shoulder-to-shoulder,'' a term also used for the annual American-Philippines military exercises.</p>
