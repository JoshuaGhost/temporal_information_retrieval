        <p>A shift of emphasis in Saturn advertising, while retaining core elements of the car brand's current campaigns, is coming after the surprising change in agencies disclosed last week.</p>
        <p>Saturn, a division of General Motors, is dismissing Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco, a unit of the Publicis Groupe, after a transition period of several months. Riney was hired by Saturn in 1988 and created all the car line's advertising since its introduction in 1990, including the familiar theme, ''A different kind of company, a different kind of car.''</p>

        <p>A shift of emphasis in Saturn advertising, while retaining core elements of the car brand's current campaigns, is coming after the surprising change in agencies disclosed last week.</p>
        <p>Saturn, a division of General Motors, is dismissing Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco, a unit of the Publicis Groupe, after a transition period of several months. Riney was hired by Saturn in 1988 and created all the car line's advertising since its introduction in 1990, including the familiar theme, ''A different kind of company, a different kind of car.''</p>
        <p>The dismissal came after sales for Saturn fell 4.1 percent last year and the division began a review for an assignment to create campaigns for a line of cars named Ion to be introduced in fall 2002. The assignment, with billings estimated at $35 million, along with the entire national and regional dealer account, with billings estimated at $300 million, was awarded to Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group, in the agency's largest single account gain since its founding in 1983.</p>
        <p>''What we learned is that people had a terrific sense of Saturn, the company, and felt good about the brand, but didn't focus on the cars,'' said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman at Goodby, Silverstein.</p>
        <p>Goodby, Silverstein will continue to create campaigns for a Saturn sibling, American Isuzu Motors; G.M. owns 49 percent of the parent, Isuzu Motors.</p>
        <p>The review lasted two months and had been narrowed to Goodby, Silverstein; Riney; and three other finalists: the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies; the New York and Troy, Mich., offices of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, part of the Bcom3 Group; and Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>Saturn and Sprint are the two largest accounts at Riney, which opened in 1986 as Hal Riney &amp; Partners. There will be an undetermined number of layoffs from the staff of 300, said Jan Carpenter, finance director.</p>
        <p>Maurice LÃ©vy, chief executive at Publicis in Paris, said: ''We are all very sad about the decision. The agency did a fantastic job in building a car brand, not very easy to do. There will be a difficult period, and the agency will have to adjust, but I'm absolutely convinced it has a superb future.''</p>
        <p>Colin Probert, co-chairman at Goodby, Silverstein, said his agency, now with 200 employees, would hire an additional amount ''in the 10's but less than 50.''</p>
