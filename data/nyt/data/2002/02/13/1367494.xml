        <p>A table in Business Day on Jan. 25 listing mutual funds and companies that had invested in notes issued by Osprey, a trust created by the Enron Corporation in 1997 to finance several partnerships, misstated the amount of debt held by First American and Firstar, mutual fund families owned by U.S. Bancorp. Firstar was merged with First American in September. Combined, they held $7.8 million in debt, not $11.8 million. Firstar did not hold $3.75 million separately.</p>
