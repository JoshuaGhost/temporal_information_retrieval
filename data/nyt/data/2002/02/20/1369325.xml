        <p>Police investigators seized 17,000 counterfeit compact discs and 2,000 counterfeit videos of current movies yesterday after executing a search warrant at two Harlem apartments, officials said.</p>
        <p>The police estimate the street value of the confiscated goods, found at 260 Lenox Avenue, at $500,000. Among the truckload of counterfeit items seized were CD's by Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson and DMX, among others, and videos including ''John Q'' and ''Black Hawk Down,'' Sgt. Ralph Carone said.</p>
        <p>''It more or less sounds like they were not selling one video at a time,'' he said. ''This was just a holding operation.''</p>
        <p>The police said that Ibrahim Diallo, 23, who lived in the building where the items were seized, and two other men, Hakeem Krah, 45, of Jamaica, Queens, and Nana Hyiaman, 36, of the Bronx, were arrested in a fourth-floor apartment during the raid at 4:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>They were charged with trademark counterfeiting, a felony.</p>
        <p>An officer from the 28th Precinct, which conducted the arrest, said the CD's were spread out over two uninhabited apartments.</p>
        <p>''There were shelves and racks of CD's from floor to ceiling,'' said the officer, who would not give his name. ''They were spread out everywhere.''</p>
        <p>The police said they believed the suspects were storing the goods in the building, but not copying them there.</p>
        <p>In the first half of 2001, the most recent period for which national figures are available, 1,257,796 pirated CD's were seized by law enforcement officials with the help of the Recording Industry Association of America's antipiracy unit.</p>
        <p>That was more than twice the 539,130 CD's seized by mid-year 2000, according to the association's Web site.</p>
