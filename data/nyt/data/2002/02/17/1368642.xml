        <p>Without formally abandoning the threat of a Senate filibuster, opponents of new campaign finance legislation have turned their attention to plans to attack it in court.</p>
        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has fought the legislation for years, insisted on Friday that he still had the 41 votes needed to maintain a filibuster. He said he would take the weeklong Congressional recess to decide whether to do so, but added, ''Should the bill become law, I will be the lead plaintiff.''</p>

        <p>Without formally abandoning the threat of a Senate filibuster, opponents of new campaign finance legislation have turned their attention to plans to attack it in court.</p>
        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has fought the legislation for years, insisted on Friday that he still had the 41 votes needed to maintain a filibuster. He said he would take the weeklong Congressional recess to decide whether to do so, but added, ''Should the bill become law, I will be the lead plaintiff.''</p>
        <p>The majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, is seeking quick action on the bill, which the House passed on Thursday. It would ban the large unlimited soft money donations to national parties from corporations, unions and rich people. It would also prohibit so-called issue advertisements if they named a candidate 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. McConnell wants one, Republicans may be unwilling to engage in a long filibuster, which would  keep the issue before the public, and Mr. Daschle has made clear that he wants to keep the Senate on the issue until he wins.</p>
        <p>House Republicans who fought the bill intensely in 17 hours of bitter debate and 18 roll calls on Wednesday and Thursday have given up hope that President Bush will veto the bill if the Senate passes it.</p>
        <p>''I think it's perfectly clear he's going to sign it,'' a highly placed Capitol Hill Republican said.</p>
        <p>But James Bopp Jr., an Indianapolis lawyer who is general counsel to the National Right to Life Committee, said he would challenge both major provisions of the bill as excessive regulation of First Amendment rights.</p>
        <p>Donald F. McGahn II, general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he expected a suit to be filed soon after the measure became law.</p>
        <p>Lawyers on both sides are meeting to examine the final version of the House bill and plan their strategies.</p>
        <p>''We've got lawyers in town who work for the Republican National Committee and the Senate and House committees reading the law carefully,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''And other election law lawyers  whom I have worked with in the past are reading it carefully.''</p>
        <p>As the House debated the bill on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Election Commission, David M. Mason, told those at a Heritage Foundation luncheon that he regarded some provisions of the legislation, including the pre-election ban on issue advertising that mentioned candidates, as ''flatly unconstitutional.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the law consequently are not relying on the federal government alone to defend it in court but are preparing their own legal team.</p>
        <p>Trevor Potter, a former election commissioner and now head of the Campaign and Media Legal Center here, said many lawyers would be involved, including Don Simon, of Common Cause; Joshua Rosenkrantz, executive director of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School; and Roger Whitten and Seth Waxman of the firm Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering. Mr. Potter said many others would also be involved.</p>
        <p>''I probably don't even know all of them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Each side has a piece of the case that it contends it has no doubt about winning.</p>
        <p>The opponents of the law see the ban on issue advertising as unquestionably unconstitutional. Mr. Bopp said, ''There are literally dozens of U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal court cases that protect issue advocacy from regulation.''</p>
        <p>Jan W. Baran, a Washington lawyer, called the advertising ban ''the most obviously vulnerable feature of this legislation.''</p>
        <p>''It's hard to pass laws prohibiting anyone, even corporations and unions, from uttering words on television,'' Mr. Baran said.</p>
        <p>But the supporters of the law argued that Congress was allowed to regulate electioneering advertisements as a result of the 1976 Supreme Court case Buckley v. Valeo, although that decision, in a footnote, defined the advertisements as only those that contain ''express words of advocacy of election or defeat, like 'vote for,' 'elect,' 'support,' 'cast your ballot for,' 'Smith for Congress,' 'vote against,' 'defeat,' 'reject.' ''</p>
        <p>Since that decision, said Mr. Waxman, solicitor general in the Clinton administration, ''the empirical data shows the overwhelming preponderance of true electioneering does not use the 'magic words.' ''</p>
        <p>A recent Brennan Center study found that ''even candidate ads, which are defined as electioneering by law, employ magic words only 10 percent of the time.'' A similar study by Prof. David B. Magleby of Brigham Young University found fewer than 10 percent used those terms. Consequently, Mr. Waxman argued, Congress should be allowed to define political advertising according to current political standards, and the bill did so.</p>
        <p>Others in his side were readier to concede the difficulties in upholding this part of the law. ''The sham issue ads provisions are harder because this is new ground for the court,'' Mr. Simon said, adding that they would require at least a reconsideration of the standard set in the Buckley case.</p>
        <p>But backers of the bill sounded very confident about the ban on soft money. Mr. Simon cited recent decisions upholding limits on contributions in Missouri and Colorado on the ground that big money led to at least the appearance of corruption.</p>
        <p>''If the court is going to uphold a law that limits contributions to $1,000,'' Mr. Simon said, ''it will uphold a law that prohibits contributions for $100,000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baran conceded that this part of the case would be harder, but he said the soft money ban effectively denied political parties their right to engage in political speech that corporations and unions could engage in, and unfairly barred national party officials and federal candidates and officeholders from raising money legally for state parties.</p>
        <p>He said it also improperly limited state parties by denying them the right to influence federal elections in their states.</p>
