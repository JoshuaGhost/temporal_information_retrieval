        <p>OUR vacation in Bora-Bora arrived in the mail the other day. I am not referring to airline tickets -- it will be a while before we can spring for such a luxury again -- but what may be the next best thing: several beige-and-brown boxes of the unique soap we had in our hotel room when we visited that French Polynesian island last year. Redolent of coconut and the tiare, a petite but potent Tahitian gardenia, it smells like nothing else on earth.</p>
        <p>I hold the soap to my nose, close my eyes, and am immediately transported to an azure lagoon framed in coconut palms. My feet are bare against fine, warm sand, and I can almost feel the breeze and the sun against my face. I inhale this fragrance and heave the sigh of the serene.</p>

        <p>OUR vacation in Bora-Bora arrived in the mail the other day. I am not referring to airline tickets -- it will be a while before we can spring for such a luxury again -- but what may be the next best thing: several beige-and-brown boxes of the unique soap we had in our hotel room when we visited that French Polynesian island last year. Redolent of coconut and the tiare, a petite but potent Tahitian gardenia, it smells like nothing else on earth.</p>
        <p>I hold the soap to my nose, close my eyes, and am immediately transported to an azure lagoon framed in coconut palms. My feet are bare against fine, warm sand, and I can almost feel the breeze and the sun against my face. I inhale this fragrance and heave the sigh of the serene.</p>
        <p>We had brought with us from Bora-Bora as much soap as we could garner from the hotel, augmented by several five-packs from the grocery store in Va√Øtape, the island's main village. Back home, wafting out of the bathroom in a cloud of shower steam, its aroma evokes murmurs of appreciation and instant nostalgia from adults and children alike. (I conveniently forget the heaps of laundry I did over the hotel sink with that same soap in the spirit of saving a few French Pacific francs.)</p>
        <p>When the stash had dwindled to a few fragrant slivers in the soap dish, we searched the Internet for it. We ordered boxes from one or two manufacturers and discovered to our disappointment that they were not the same brands as ours: they had more cloying, soapier smells that failed to conjure paradise.</p>
        <p>Finally, using the fax number on the soap package, I sent a letter in French to the manufacturer in the Tahitian capital, Papeete, and thus was able to track down a small distributor in California. Never mind that the cost of a bar was more than twice what we would pay in Tahiti -- should we put a price on such an olfactory visitation and the sensations it induced?</p>
        <p>There is, indeed, something infinitely pleasurable about possessing products unique to foreign countries. Of course, there is always the sophistication they impart to the user, along with the cachet of having something one's neighbors do not. Underlying all this may be a suspicion on our part, whether warranted or not, that people keep what is best, and more of it, on their own soil.</p>
        <p>Better yet, though, are the memories that a taste, a whiff or even a glance at a package can evoke. When I eat bona fide Dijon mustard, for example, I like to pretend I'm back at the Paris bistro where, following the lead of the French, I first tried it on my frites instead of ketchup. I want my eyes to tear up, my nostrils to quiver, and my taste buds to revel in recognition.</p>
        <p>Try as I might, I haven't been able to find in America any mustard that passes muster, even the so-called imported brands because they are usually tailored to American tastes. This is why friends from France must arrive bearing, not Champagne or foie gras, but a large jar of Dijon. Nothing fancy  -- the mass-market brand does the trick.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the very difficulty of procuring something sentimentally precious can make possession all the sweeter. Russian caviar, reputedly the world's best, surely tasted even better in the days of strict Soviet regulation when I had to seek it out in a clandestine setting in Moscow and smuggle it past stern Slavic officials at the airport. The story also rendered the regaler the instant life of the party when the caviar was served.</p>
        <p>Not everyone shares his goodies, though. A friend of ours in Melbourne pines so for a particular Belgian beer made from macerated sour cherries that he recently spent a small fortune ordering a six-pack of it via David Jones, an upscale Australian department store. After a four-month wait for the bottles to arrive, he then rationed them only on special -- and solitary -- occasions.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, travelers usually don't have to go to such extremes to get what they want, but the result can make traveling light an impossibility. Consider my sister Marilyn, a serious chef who routinely buys even unusual products in bulk. She once made a pilgrimage to Fauchon, the gourmet's mecca at Place de la Madeleine in Paris, and came away with six jugs of gray sea salt from Brittany. This, she announced to her more culinarily challenged sister, is the layer of salt that most retains the smell of the sea and is excellent in fish recipes.</p>
        <p>So Marilyn was crushed when her rental car was broken into a few days later down in Aix-en-Provence. The thief, you see, greedily grabbed the heaviest suitcase, which turned out to contain the unlikely combination of French lingerie and a veritable  motherlode of gray sea salt.</p>
        <p>What Brittany is to salt, King Island is to cream. King Island, which lies in the Bass Strait off Tasmania, is a place where somehow the forces of nature conspire to make the grass greener, the cows happier and the cream richer than perhaps anywhere else on the planet. I'm talking about stuff that will stand up to any spoon, and you can't find it outside Australia.</p>
        <p>When my in-laws arrive from Australia, they know to bring us -- along with my husband's supply of that awful Vegemite spread I call La Brea tar pits on toast -- a couple of pints of King Island cream, which they carefully keep cool during the marathon flight to New York. Their arrival will mean that I can make my biannual King Island leek-and-goat-cheese pie. It's an outstanding recipe that will not work -- and I have tried -- with any other dairy product.</p>
        <p>Every once in a while, some esoteric but welcome product will find its way into a local store. My friend Bob in New York, driven crazy by a neighbor's renovations, was ecstatic recently to find in an Upper East Side pharmacy a particularly efficient type of French earplug he hadn't seen in years. I was a bit nonplused to hear him waxing enthusiastic about such a mundane gadget. But I came to suspect that the sight of the package had recalled more romantic days in a non-air-conditioned apartment in Paris, where street noise through the open window made sleep elusive, at best.</p>
        <p>My sister Marilyn, meanwhile, may have started taking this foreign romance stuff with a grain of salt. During another European sojourn, she fell in love with a brand of oatcakes, which, she assures me, the Scots serve ''so brilliantly'' with cheese. Tiring of stocking up on them every time she set foot in Britain, she decided to circumvent the problem when she found a restaurant in Cornwall that made its own excellent oatcakes. ''I bribed the waitress to pinch the recipe off the chef,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the crackers were to remain inimitable. ''The recipe is all in metric measures,'' Marilyn said ruefully. ''And I haven't gotten around to translating it.''</p>
        <p>Economic globalization, however, can take a lot of the fun out of all this epicurean procuring, rendering goodies into mere goods. Marilyn learned this as far back as the early 90's, when she found some beautiful red and blue crockery with a fish motif in Vietri, Italy. She liked it so much that she spent a fortune having an entire set shipped home to Long Island.</p>
        <p>Back in New York only two weeks later, she was strolling through Macy's Cellar when she spotted ceramic wares identical to the ones she had found in Italy, except  for one thing -- when she took the shipping into account, these dishes were half the price.</p>
