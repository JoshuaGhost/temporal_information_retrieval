        <p>Jason Kidd had been given warnings about tampering from the National Basketball Association and a lecture on the same subject from Nets General Manager Rod Thorn. Although he spoke cautiously today, it was clear who would be on his mind Sunday when the Denver Nuggets arrived at the Meadowlands to play the Nets.</p>
        <p>Kidd made it clear last summer that he would love to be reunited with Antonio McDyess, the 6-foot-9 forward he played with in Phoenix and on the United States Olympic team. McDyess is expected to be with the Nuggets on Sunday, though he has been sidelined by an injury the entire season. Asked today if he might be host to a dinner for McDyess, Kidd unfurled a knowing smile. ''That wouldn't be a bad idea,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Jason Kidd had been given warnings about tampering from the National Basketball Association and a lecture on the same subject from Nets General Manager Rod Thorn. Although he spoke cautiously today, it was clear who would be on his mind Sunday when the Denver Nuggets arrived at the Meadowlands to play the Nets.</p>
        <p>Kidd made it clear last summer that he would love to be reunited with Antonio McDyess, the 6-foot-9 forward he played with in Phoenix and on the United States Olympic team. McDyess is expected to be with the Nuggets on Sunday, though he has been sidelined by an injury the entire season. Asked today if he might be host to a dinner for McDyess, Kidd unfurled a knowing smile. ''That wouldn't be a bad idea,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If the Nets were to make the long-rumored deal this summer, Kidd would undoubtedly welcome the addition of McDyess, who averaged 20.8 points and 12.1 rebounds a game last season.</p>
        <p>''I haven't had a chance to talk to him, unfortunately,'' Kidd said. ''But this is a guy, we have a friendship that's grown, playing on the Olympic team, and I had an opportunity to play with him in Phoenix. So he is considered a friend of mine. I've talked to him in the past just to see how he's doing outside the game of basketball, too.''</p>
        <p>McDyess was sidelined after surgery on Oct. 12 to repair the patella tendon in his left knee. He was expected to return last week, but soreness in his knee and a lack of practice have stalled his season debut.</p>
        <p>''He's the type of guy who's going to get you 20, 25 points and 10 to 15 rebounds every night, so that's a big part of their team that's gone,'' Nets Coach Byron Scott said. ''He's been gone for the whole season, and I think that's one of the reasons why they've been struggling.''</p>
        <p>McDyess may be trade bait this summer, but the more immediate talk surrounds Nick Van Exel, who will sit out Sunday's game with a sore elbow, and Raef LaFrentz. Van Exel's problems with the Nuggets have accelerated trade speculation this week, and LaFrentz's solid play has served as an enticement to other teams.</p>
        <p>But the Nets (33-17), after pounding the depleted Chicago Bulls, 106-81, on Friday night, are concerned with their own play, not who is dressing for Denver.</p>
        <p>Denver (16-32) defeated Minnesota, 99-98, on Friday, and Scott said,  ''So they played pretty good without those guys.''</p>
        <p>The Nets played without Kenyon Martin on Friday and might do so again Sunday. After aggravating an injury to his right forearm on Thursday, Martin had a magnetic resonance imaging exam Friday. It revealed a strained ligament.</p>
        <p>The team had a light workout today and Martin said the pain he experienced made it unlikely that he would play Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I'll see how it feels in the morning,'' Martin said. ''The way I feel right now, I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>Scott said: ''When he was shooting today, it seemed like he looked O.K. after he got warmed up a little bit. His first five or six shots were real short, but he seemed like he got a little looser and shot better.''</p>
