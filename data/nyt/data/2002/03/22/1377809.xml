        <p>World leaders implored rich nations today to give far more aid to the poor, warning that grinding poverty converts needy countries into incubators for terrorism and chaos.</p>
        <p>''No one in this world can feel comfortable or safe while so many are suffering and deprived,'' said Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general. He called poverty and inequality the greatest threats to world peace.</p>
        <p>Doubling development aid to the world's poorest nations and halving global poverty by 2015 are among the aims of the United Nations conference here, where more than 50 presidents and prime ministers have gathered this week.</p>
        <p>The meeting, which ends Friday, has already pushed the United States to promise billions in new aid, reversing its post-cold-war policies. The European Union has pledged billions as well. But their promises would provide no more than one-quarter of the $50 billion a year in new funds Mr. Annan seeks.</p>
        <p>The conference has also compelled the leaders of the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, gathered together for the first time, to address the poor in terms rarely associated with high finance. The W.T.O.'s director, Mike Moore, called global poverty ''a time bomb lodged against the heart of liberty.''</p>
        <p>Above all, Mr. Annan said, the conference would increase and ''maintain the pressure on our leaders and politicians'' to find more ways to aid 2.5 billion people living on $2 a day or less.</p>
        <p>''Two weeks ago no one was even thinking about an increase,'' said the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn. Today the United States and Europe are ''prepared to write checks,'' he said. ''That's not a Hollywood step, that's a real step.''</p>
        <p>This morning, Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, opened the day's session by calling the world's efforts on behalf of the poor to date ''meager, tardy and disheartening.''</p>
        <p>The president of the United Nations General Assembly, Han Seung Soo, quoting the Mexican poet, Octavio Paz, said the richest nations could no longer afford to be ''islands of abundance in an ocean of universal misery.'' The consequence, he said, would be the poorest nations becoming ''the breeding ground for violence.''</p>
        <p>Then Peru's president, Alejandro Toledo, took the stage. Hours earlier, a car bomb had exploded in front of the United States Embassy in Lima, Peru's capital, killing nine people.</p>
        <p>''Poverty conspires against democracy,'' he said. ''Global security is inextricably linked with the health of the world economy,'' and helping the poor is inseparable from ''a strong and determined fight against terrorism.''</p>
        <p>King Abdullah of Jordan, an important American ally in the Arab world, called poor nations ''breeding grounds for conflict'' between ''Western haves and worldwide have-nots.''</p>
        <p>The weapons for a ''victory over terror,'' he said, must include financial aid from rich nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not drawn quite so direct a link between economic suffering and political rage.</p>
        <p>''Poverty doesn't cause terrorism,'' he said last week in announcing that he would increase the foreign aid budget by 50 percent bringing it to $15 billion by 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush arrived here this evening on Air Force One and headed immediately into a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Fox and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien of Canada. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said the leaders talked about border security and trade. Tonight Mr. Bush was attending a reception for heads of state. On Friday he is to deliver a speech on American foreign aid followed in the evening by a news conference with Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has said, and most of the Monterrey conferees agree, that increased development aid should flow only to deserving nations that will spend the aid wisely. Europe has promised roughly $20 billion in aid spending over the same period. Still, those sums far fall short of what the Monterrey conference says is needed.</p>
        <p>Foreign aid dropped off sharply after the cold war ended. Many governments believed that globalization and the increased flow of capital and trade across international borders had greater benefits than official loans and grants. But the Monterrey conferees, with the exception of a very few, say that trade cannot supplant aid.</p>
        <p>Some of the most fierce critics of the wealthy world at their conference today were its own leaders. Guy Verhofstadt, the prime minister of Belgium, said today that ''the collective selfishness of the rich world'' has contributed to ''the despair of hundreds of millions of people -- alone, dispossessed, powerless.''</p>
        <p>But fiercest of all was Fidel Castro of Cuba, dressed in battle fatigues, whose short but scathing critique of the world powers assembled before him led the American contingent to walk out of the closed conference hall.</p>
        <p>''The world economy today is a huge casino,'' Mr. Castro said, run by the self-appointed ''masters of the world,'' whose ''traditional offers of assistance, always scant and often ridiculous, are either inadequate or unfulfilled.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro departed before President Bush's arrival, saying ''a special situation created by my participation in this summit obligates me to immediately return'' to Cuba. Officials said Mr. Castro may have taken offense at remarks by Mr. Bush's aides, who had said in no uncertain terms this week that the two men would not meet at Monterrey -- publicly, privately or accidentally.</p>
