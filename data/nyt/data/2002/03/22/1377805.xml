        <p>Editorial welcomes Gates Foundation donation of $40 million to help start 70 small high schools around country that will give disadvantaged students more challenging college-level work and enable some to earn two-year associate degrees while getting their high school diplomas; says New Yorkers can take pride in fact that model was pioneered in their city in late 1990's by then-Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, with funding from Gates, Carnegie and Soros foundations; says College Now program has been resounding success for its participants</p>

        <p>New York City's public schools are infamous for budget problems, building delays and the political dogfights that have created a revolving door at the schools chancellor's office. It is less well known that the system has also produced some of the nation's biggest success stories. One of the most innovative programs, developed during the late 1990's, is aimed at public education's most daunting and intractable problem -- its high schools.</p>
        <p>The bookshelves are groaning with models for remaking grade schools. But reformers have typically turned away from high schools, where underperforming students are much harder to help. In the late 1990's Rudy Crew, then New York City's schools chancellor, took exception to this lack of attention to high school reforms. With funding from the Gates, Carnegie and Soros foundations, the city broke some of its large, underperforming high schools into smaller units where students could have a closer relationship with their teachers. The system has also greatly enlarged the College Now program, which exposes 9th through 12th graders to college-level work as a way of stimulating their interest in school.</p>

        <p>New York City's public schools are infamous for budget problems, building delays and the political dogfights that have created a revolving door at the schools chancellor's office.

One of the most innovative programs, developed during the late 1990's, is aimed at public education's most daunting and intractable problem -- its high schools.</p>
        <p>The bookshelves are groaning with models for remaking grade schools. But reformers have typically turned away from high schools, where underperforming students are much harder to help. In the late 1990's Rudy Crew, then New York City's schools chancellor, took exception to this lack of attention to high school reforms. With funding from the Gates, Carnegie and Soros foundations, the city broke some of its large, underperforming high schools into smaller units where students could have a closer relationship with their teachers. The system has also greatly enlarged the College Now program, which exposes 9th through 12th graders to college-level work as a way of stimulating their interest in school.</p>
        <p>School systems all over the country make it possible for strong high school students to take college courses. But College Now targets underperforming teenagers who are more likely to drop out. High schoolers can take City University placement tests and, if they fail, get remedial help from CUNY instructors before they leave high school. Those who pass the tests can take college-level courses right away. College Now participants outscore their peers on the state Regents examinations, accumulate credits more quickly -- and have significantly better attendance records.</p>
        <p>This week the Gates Foundation announced that it would put up more than $40 million to help start 70 small high schools around the country that will give disadvantaged students more challenging college-level work and enable some to earn two-year associate degrees while getting their high school diplomas. New Yorkers can take pride in the fact that the model was pioneered in their city.</p>
