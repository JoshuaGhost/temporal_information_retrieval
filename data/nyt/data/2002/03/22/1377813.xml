        <p>Prompting vigorous protests from Arab American and Islamic groups, federal law enforcement officials today continued raiding the homes and offices of individuals suspected of helping to launder money for Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups.</p>
        <p>There was no public announcement of the raids, which began on Wednesday and continued overnight and throughout the day, mainly in Virginia.</p>
        <p>But people close to the investigation said the raids were conducted by the Treasury Department counterterrorism task force responsible for stopping the flow of money to terrorist groups in the United States and abroad. The agency has declined to comment on its action or to identify the targets of its searches or the nature of the information being sought.</p>
        <p>A copy of one of the sealed search warrants states that the government is seeking wide-ranging financial information about the Safa Trust and the Saar Group, a sister organization, both of which have ties to one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest families, as well as 17 other Islamic charities and businesses, many of them also financed partly by wealthy Saudis and the Saudi government.</p>
        <p>The St. Petersburg Times in Florida first reported on the search warrant's contents today.</p>
        <p>The warrant also states that the government is looking for information about Al Qaeda and two Palestinian terrorist groups, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. It is also seeking information relating to the World and Islam Studies Enterprise, or WISE, a now-defunct research group in Florida; the Islamic Committee for Palestine; and a Palestinian professor of computer engineering in Tampa, Fla., whom law enforcement officials are investigating in connection with terrorist ties.</p>
        <p>Officials say the professor, Sami Al-Arian, used WISE and the committee to raise money for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which the State Department labeled a terrorist group in 1995. The professor was suspended from his university position but has never been charged with a crime. He could not be reached for comment today.</p>
        <p>The warrant also states that the government is seeking ''any and all information'' that refers to Osama bin Laden, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman -- the blind sheik who is serving a life term in prison for his role in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center -- and several other people the government has designated as terrorists.</p>
        <p>Among the residences raided today were those of Dr. Abdulhamid Abu Sulayman, and Hisham Al-Talib, both in Reston, Va.</p>
        <p>State records list Dr. Sulayman as the director-general of the International Institute of Islamic Thought, a nonprofit group in Herndon, Va., that was a leading financier of Mr. Al-Arian's defunct research group. Virginia records identified Mr. Talib as the one-time treasurer of the Islamic-thought institute, as well as a director and treasurer of the Safa Trust.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, federal customs agents also seized documents, files, three desk-top computers, numerous diskettes, and copies of a recent academic manuscript from the home of Taha Al-Awani and Mona Abul-Fadl, both associated with the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences in Leesburg, Va.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Abul-Fadl, who teaches political science and women's studies, said federal agents stormed into their home in Herndon, Va., at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. Mrs. Abul-Fadl, who said she was alone, said she was awakened as they broke in the front door, with guns drawn. ''They claimed to have knocked,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Abul-Fadl, who said she felt as if she had been raped, was clearly shaken as she described the incident almost 24 hours later.</p>
        <p>''Normally, if one is in that situation, one would call the police,'' said Mrs. Abul-Fadl, 56. ''But now, there is something ironic, even pathetic about it.</p>
        <p>''What police would you call now?''</p>
