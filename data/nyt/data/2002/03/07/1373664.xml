        <p>Strong collections by Angela Missoni and Donatella Versace closed the fall 2002 shows here, as each shrewdly sidestepped gimmicks and other stylish hokum to deliver fine female punch.</p>
        <p>Ms. Versace, practically girdled in black leather and cuffed in diamonds, wouldn't be anyone's idea of a birch-rapping schoolmarm. When she wants your attention, she simply cranks up the volume, as she did tonight with an earsplitting blast of rock that made the audience jump. But clearly, class -- glamour class -- was in session as the models hit the runway in a fast-paced revue of mean tailoring and roiling color prints, which Ms. Versace showed on coats as well as on chiffon blouses that flashed under arctic-white pantsuits.</p>

        <p>Strong collections by Angela Missoni and Donatella Versace closed the fall 2002 shows here, as each shrewdly sidestepped gimmicks and other stylish hokum to deliver fine female punch.</p>
        <p>Ms. Versace, practically girdled in black leather and cuffed in diamonds, wouldn't be anyone's idea of a birch-rapping schoolmarm. When she wants your attention, she simply cranks up the volume, as she did tonight with an earsplitting blast of rock that made the audience jump. But clearly, class -- glamour class -- was in session as the models hit the runway in a fast-paced revue of mean tailoring and roiling color prints, which Ms. Versace showed on coats as well as on chiffon blouses that flashed under arctic-white pantsuits.</p>
        <p>Though the collection was in some ways  formula Versace, with bosoms trapped in tiny tops and thighs spilling out of wispy evening gowns, it also displayed a knowing confidence with sexy clothes. After all, sex is Versace country. So why blow your cool just because other designers are suddenly awakening to the joys of hot clothes? It was funny watching the faces of the male store executives, in particular those  from Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, as the more womanly models stalked past and then posed right before their eyes. They were in heaven. They would look up, beaming with delight, and you could see one or two of them forming the word ''Wow!'' with their lips, like fish swimming up to the aquarium glass to check out the interesting humans.</p>
        <p>Versace glamour meant gold stiletto sandals lashed around the ankles with braided cord, and tiny gold buttons kissing the back of flaring trouser hems. In lieu of other adornment, there was color -- soda pink, taxi yellow, bright pool aqua -- and it kept bubbling up and exploding into fantasia patterns on giant video screens in the background.</p>
        <p>Yet, even amid all this floor-show vitality, the lines of the clothes looked clean: belted wool coats, scoop-neck dresses in printed jersey or chiffon that hugged the body and fluttered around the knees, a sleek black suit worn over a hooded hot-pink jersey top. Low-riding pants that gripped the rear seemed a miss in a season of more fluid styles with high, well-defined waists. But the collection had enough standout examples of craft, including a bone shearling coat with gold-embroidered stars and swirls scattered over the shoulders, to make up for a lapse or two in judgment.</p>
        <p>For the first time in a long while, Ms. Missoni sent out a collection today that not only drew upon her family's knitwear legacy, but also seemed connected to the here and now. In the past, her shows have excelled in awkward attempts to expand Missoni zigzag knit patterns into fabrics and tailoring, often with hip styling gestures that only added to the muddle.</p>
        <p>But this season, Ms. Missoni, like so many designers here, stuck to what she does best, and the upshot was the most distinctive collection of the shows. Nearly every outfit expressed some kind of knitting technique and decorative style beyond formula. Here were blouson sweaters, in ziggy bands of earthy hues, which slipped off one shoulder and were worn with simple corduroy skirts, and tops and coats sprouting graphic stripes of yarn curls or fringe.</p>
        <p>The opulent flower motifs of Venetian glass and the Wiener Werkst√§tte were Ms. Missoni's inspiration for patterns that appeared in knitted skirts and dresses, some with open lacing at the neck. But she translated these heavy references lightly, with more sweetness than arty significance, and it helped that her lines were long and lean. Designers often use airy words like ''passion'' and ''fantasy'' in their program notes, and you think, 'Ah, more fake symbolism.' Today, however, Ms. Missoni meant what she said.</p>
        <p>Slick nude boots on high white heels, perky khaki rain togs, jaunty blazers and bouncy collegiate hair: hubba-hubba, it's Miu Miu meets L. L. Bean. Well, not exactly. Miuccia Prada's youthful Miu Miu collection showed a bit more sexy play today than the Freeport, Me., purveyor of homey cotton turtlenecks and mothering tweeds. There were jumpsuits with halter necklines, khaki minidresses and coats with girlishly puffed sleeves and goldenrod piping, clingy hot pants and trousers rolled under at the ankles like old-fashioned ski pants. It was prep style with spit polish: sport couture.</p>
        <p>Yet the essence of that old blueblood style was to look relaxed and not call too much attention to oneself. And these clothes seem to demand that you admire the cool turnout of a red blazer over a shirt and a cotton turtleneck, while implying something wicked in the hot pants. But real wicked cool wouldn't be nearly so contrived nor require so much effort.</p>
        <p>Christopher Bailey, the new designer for Burberry's Prorsum label, did a good job last night of bringing a fresh eccentricity to English country clothes -- although that term hardly describes a collection free of plaids and sensible macs. Mr. Bailey's gestures are more subtle: glossy velvet blazers now in moody paisley, low-fitting pleated skirts that vaguely hint of kilts, sturdy cardigans in rich textures. He overthinks some of the details -- straps and tab flaps that go nowhere -- and his clothes could do with a bit more humor. But as a designer, he clearly has something to say.</p>
        <p>Alberta Ferretti, on the other hand, seemed to be experiencing another fashion ''Groundhog Day'' moment, sending out variations of the same deconstructed black chiffon dress -- now a strip of fabric here, now one there. At Pucci yesterday, the orange and brown swirl patterns looked great on long, lean wool dresses, but the collection lacked wit and surprise.</p>
