        <p>THE dot-com bust is old news. Growth in the nation's Internet population has slowed. And strangely enough, now may not be such a bad time to be an e-tailer.</p>
        <p>Two reports set for release today present complementary reasons for optimism.

        <p>THE dot-com bust is old news. Growth in the nation's Internet population has slowed. And strangely enough, now may not be such a bad time to be an e-tailer.</p>
        <p>Two reports set for release today present complementary reasons for optimism. First, as Internet users accrue one to three years of experience online, they become much more likely to shop or conduct other financial-related activities on the Web, according to a report by the nonprofit Pew Internet and American Life Project.</p>
        <p>So although the spike in new Internet users in the late 90's has long passed, many of those users are only now joining the world of online shopping (further evidence that the defunct online merchants that threw all their venture capital or I.P.O. cash at television advertising in 1999 would have been wise to conserve their ammunition).</p>
        <p>The second report comes from Jupiter Media Metrix, the online research and consulting firm. It suggests that as online users become more comfortable with the idea of shopping, and as newcomers do the same in the next few years, the Internet shopping population will not only grow briskly, but will reflect offline demographics much more closely than today. That should give a lift to mass-market online retailers who cater to older people.</p>
        <p>The Pew report confirms a notion that had been a widely held belief for years but that had not been supported by much research, according to Lee Rainie, director of Pew's Internet and American Life Project.</p>
        <p>''When you first go online, you do the fun stuff -- e-mail, instant messaging, games, information searches,'' Mr. Rainie said, referring to conclusions drawn by Pew researchers observing changes in behavior among 1,500 online users from March 2000 to March 2001. Next comes ''health-related research, research on government sites, and on products and finance,'' Mr. Rainie said.</p>
        <p>''Somewhere between Year 1 and Year 3 of online life, many take the plunge and make a purchase, which is a big threshold to cross,'' Mr. Rainie said. ''It involves a lot more trust, and faith in an online business to keep very critical information secure. But once you do that, you're a very different Internet user from someone who hasn't done it. You use the Internet in a lot more aspects of your life.''</p>
        <p>One of the open questions, Mr. Rainie said, is whether this year's newcomers will follow the same pattern when they reach veteran status. ''The jury's still out on that, but there's a lot of hope, particularly looking at the commercial side of things, that people go through a learning curve online.''</p>
        <p>The Jupiter research takes the e-tail evolution as a given. Ken Cassar, author of the Jupiter report, predicts that the number of online shoppers in the coming few years will grow much more quickly than that of overall Internet users, suggesting that the recent boom years for new Internet users will result in a lagging boom in Internet shoppers.</p>
        <p>Jupiter predicts that the number of online shoppers, which it says now number 67 million, will grow to 132 million over the next four years. The number of Internet users, meanwhile, ''will only show single digit annual growth'' over that period, Mr. Cassar said.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, those shoppers will ''continue to move up the food chain,'' Mr. Cassar said, making more ambitious transactions as they log more online time. ''After people make the Amazon purchase a few times,'' he said, they will buy something like travel or a computer, which are higher-priced expenditures  but do not require close inspection to engender confidence in an online shopper. ''Or they'll buy something like apparel,'' which is less pricey but is risky, in that it may be the wrong size or color.</p>
        <p>The next logical evolution will be consumers willing to buy high-priced apparel and other goods that, in the past, have been too risky for online shoppers to buy, Mr. Cassar said. He estimated that it might be five years before e-tailing reaches the point that a significant number of online shoppers buy such goods.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there could be plenty of opportunity for other retailers. Jupiter expects the number of online shoppers who are age 50 or older, for instance, to triple over the next four years, from 10 million to 30 million,  making it the fastest-growing demographic among Internet shoppers. Yet, the percentage of affluent online shoppers, with household incomes of over $75,000, is expected to drop -- from 39 percent today to 33 percent in 2006, as more people from the lower-income brackets begin shopping online. (The number of affluent shoppers is still expected to grow, however, to 44 million from 26 million.)</p>
        <p>Such projections raise interesting questions for Web merchants. Many such businesses have spent the last several years trying to appeal to as broad a range of people as possible. But with a few years of experience and a clearer picture of what the online shopping population may soon look like soon, some e-tailers are zeroing in on a more narrow -- and perhaps more profitable -- set of customers.</p>
        <p>Take Drugstore.com. According to Michael O. Jaglois, vice president for marketing, the company recently began re-evaluating its product mix and marketing strategy, to better cater to middle-age women, whom he labeled the ''sweet spot'' of Drugstore.com's customer base.</p>
        <p>Not only has the company begun featuring the voices of such women in radio ads, Mr. Jaglois said, but it is also offering more merchandise that will ''speak to women who'll take the time to indulge themselves occasionally,'' like prestige lines of body cream and bubble bath.</p>
        <p>Left behind, for the moment, will be a population that has, Mr. Jaglois said, proven to be ''not profitable at all'' for Drugstore .com. Namely, younger men. ''It's not like we're turning them away, and they can still get what they've gotten from us in the past,'' he said. ''But we're not speaking their language.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaglois would not quantify the sales improvement since the company began these changes, but he said ''we're very pleased with the results thus far.''</p>
        <p>Marketing changes are also in the offing at Travelocity, said Michael A. Stacy, the company's senior vice president for marketing. Mr. Stacy said that in mid-February company executives ''started looking at what we need to do to attract that next wave of consumer.'' Travelocity's average customer is now between 30 and 34 years old, he said, with a household income of $75,000, and the company hopes to attract older customers and those with lower incomes.</p>
        <p>To lure a broader audience, Mr. Stacy said he would not necessarily start throwing money at TV networks. But he does intend to  start advertising more online. ''That's been panned left and right,'' he said, but Travelocity has found online ads valuable enough to spend ''a significantly greater'' portion of its budget this year on Internet advertising and sponsorships than in years past.</p>
        <p>The company has also begun testing products meant to appeal to older travelers. Late last year, Travelocity rolled out a ''senior fares'' feature, which, Mr. Stacy said, ''has been selling exceptionally well.'' The company does not intend to shift its focus to older customers; it is simply trying to get ahead of the curve.</p>
        <p>''Before we make a commitment, we want to test it out thoroughly,'' Mr. Stacy said. ''That's where we're at'' with the older travelers now, he said. ''The trick is to be there before the wave hits.''</p>
