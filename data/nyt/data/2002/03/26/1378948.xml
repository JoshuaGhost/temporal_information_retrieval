        <p>BLOOD was oozing from three or four stitches just past Steve Webb's right eye. He preferred to talk about the feeling in the arena.</p>

        <p>On Monday night, the Islanders darkened the Rangers' playoff hopes. It seemed like old times.</p>

        <p>BLOOD was oozing from three or four stitches just past Steve Webb's right eye. He preferred to talk about the feeling in the arena.</p>
        <p>''Now I see why all the old guys come around,'' he said, referring to the old Islanders who return to Nassau Coliseum, partially out of nostalgia but also in the hopes that the old days just might come back again for the new players.</p>
        <p>Webb is a feisty wing who admitted, ''I got a few zips in me,'' meaning old scars. Theo Fleury gave him the newest zip in the first period, but Webb later put a hit on Fleury that turned the game around.</p>
        <p>The ground used to tremble in the spring when the Islanders and the Rangers met. They held eight separate Stanley Cup playoffs series between 1975 and 1994, with the Islanders winning five of them.</p>
        <p>This was not a playoff series in the intimate outpost on Hempstead Turnpike, but the Rangers are trying to stave off their fifth straight barren season, and last night's 4-2 loss just may have crushed them.</p>
        <p>It felt like the old days, with the parking lot close to full long before game time and the 16,234 seats sold out. But there was one marked difference -- the lusty chant of ''Let's go, Rangers!'' when Roman Lyashenko scored the temporary go-ahead goal.</p>
        <p>Tickets to Islanders games are so readily available that they wind up in the hands of Rangers fans. That never happened in the old days.</p>
        <p>The Islanders, trying to qualify for their first playoff since 1994, gained 2 vital points and raised the old echoes when Oleg Kvasha scored two late goals and then Claude Lapointe scored into an empty net.</p>
        <p>Webb has played here since 1996-97, never making the playoffs and wondering why everybody makes such a big deal about the old days. Last night, Fleury bloodied him in the first period, and they had yapped at each other, but Peter Laviolette, the poised young coach, told the Islanders to stop the aggression after the whistle.</p>
        <p>In the second period, Laviolette thought it was ''getting flat out there -- you've got to get the fans into the game.'' So he said, ''Stevie, go out and hit somebody.''</p>
        <p>It didn't matter whom, they all claimed, but Webb just happened to spot Fleury, who has been known to flail his elbows and mock Eric Cairns with his so-called chicken dance. The last time he was here, Fleury gave an impolite gesture to the fans. Cost him $1,000, but Fleury was undoubtedly happy for having expressed himself.</p>
        <p>Last night, Webb whacked Fleury, who flopped to the ice for emphasis but got no sympathy from the fans -- or the officials, for that matter. The fans took care of the sound effects with a rather unpleasant chant about Fleury. It gets personal between these teams. In the past, the Rangers were jealous of the Islanders' greatness, and the Islanders were jealous of the Rangers' visibility in the big city, but it wasn't mean and personal, the way it is now.</p>
        <p>You can talk about the Dodgers and the Giants if you want to get into ancient history. You can talk about the Lakers and the Celtics back in the 80's, when Red Auerbach turned off the hot water in the visiting locker room, or Auburn-Alabama in college football, or Roma and Lazio in the regional soccer derby of Italy. The rivalry between the Islanders and the Rangers used to be that good.</p>
        <p>In 1979, the Islanders were supposed to be on their way toward a dynasty, but the Rangers stunned them in six games in a semifinal series.</p>
        <p>When Ron Greschner of the Rangers got married on Long Island nearly two decades ago, a few Islander fans infiltrated the reception and unveiled Islander sweatshirts.</p>
        <p>The Islanders went through the Rangers to their third straight Stanley Cup in 1982. Then in 1983, the teams were even at two games apiece in a division series, when Bob Bourne of the Islanders made what his teammate Duane Sutter called ''the prettiest goal I have ever seen,'' splitting two seasoned defenders with a burst of beautiful athletic speed and moves.</p>
        <p>The next spring, Ken Morrow, not known as a scorer, fired in a slap shot in overtime and some Rangers wept in their locker room.</p>
        <p>When the Rangers began their 1994 Stanley Cup run with a sweep, the Islanders were so depleted that Ranger fans could hardly even brag. Last night, the Islanders went a long way toward darkening Madison Square Garden in a few weeks. Webb and Laviolette are starting to understand why people get that misty look when they talk about the old days out here.</p>
