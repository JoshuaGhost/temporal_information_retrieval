        <p>To the Editor: Buried in John Freeman Gill's article about navigating the canal on a Holland America Line ship are hints of that line's crassness, but he does not go far enough.</p>
        <p>Two years ago my wife and I took another Holland America ship, the Noordam, on a two-month cruise through the canal and around South America. We felt that every moment on board, the company was trying to get us to part with our money (photographs, bingo, ''art'' auctions, shopping, extra charges for drinks and shore excursions -- all tremendously overpriced).</p>
        <p>At the same time, we were subjected to an unceasing pep talk about how much fun we were having. This was despite the evidence before our eyes of delayed departures, decks packed with still-to-be-loaded supplies, engine failures, air-conditioning failures and endless lines for just about everything. The staff treated the passengers like little children with a manner polite and yet very condescending.</p>
        <p>When I wrote a letter of complaint I received a form letter apology. They must purchase those forms in large quantities.</p>
        <p>RICHARD EPRO  New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Erik Elvejord, spokesman for Holland America Line, responds: In researching that cruise, I found only one letter of complaint. I don't want to minimize Mr. Epro's concerns but I do want to be clear that there was not a pattern. Holland America has adapted its style of cruising over the years based on overall customer comments. We feel the on-board product is dynamic. Regarding engine failure and air-conditioning shutdowns, we address those situations as they come up -- as quickly as possible.</p>
