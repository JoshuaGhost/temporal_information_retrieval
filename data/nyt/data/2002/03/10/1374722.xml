        <p>Profile of and interview with Alexandra Stoddard, onetime decorator who now writes best-selling inspirational books and whose Upper East Side apartment is as colorful as her wardrobe; Stoddard comments on her philosophy of life and her new book, Choose Happiness; photos (M)</p>

        <p>''YOU'RE not going to be dreary on the inside if you're not dreary on the outside,'' said Alexandra Stoddard, vibrating slightly in a hot pink silk Shantung suit from Shanghai Tang. ''I get all dressed up in fuchsia, looking like a clown, and show pretty pictures to people.''</p>
        <p>A onetime decorator who has been turning out inspirational books for three decades, Ms. Stoddard shimmered among the candles, the blowsy tulips, the bowls of Jordan Almonds and majolica lemons in her Upper East Side apartment. Her lipstick was pink, and her coral earrings were pink; so were her stockings and her quilted suede loafers. And when she hooked a thumb through a bra strap, you could see that her underwear was pink, too.</p>

        <p>Alexandra Stoddard, a former decorator who writes best-selling inspirational books, says, "Happiness has been given a bum rap."</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>''YOU'RE not going to be dreary on the inside if you're not dreary on the outside,'' said Alexandra Stoddard, vibrating slightly in a hot pink silk Shantung suit from Shanghai Tang. ''I get all dressed up in fuchsia, looking like a clown, and show pretty pictures to people.''</p>
        <p>A onetime decorator who has been turning out inspirational books for three decades, Ms. Stoddard shimmered among the candles, the blowsy tulips, the bowls of Jordan Almonds and majolica lemons in her Upper East Side apartment. Her lipstick was pink, and her coral earrings were pink; so were her stockings and her quilted suede loafers. And when she hooked a thumb through a bra strap, you could see that her underwear was pink, too.</p>
        <p>''Give 'em a laugh,'' Ms. Stoddard continued, in the husky voice of a practiced public speaker. ''It's too much fun to dress like this. Why not? Every day is a balloon day.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stoddard's world, like her apartment, is retro rose-colored, though her Yankee-Zen message is unexpectedly fresh, a mirror for our times: Life is short, eat a strawberry with powdered sugar, take a breath, take another, take a bubble bath.</p>
        <p>Though she has been a perennial best-seller in the advice and how-to aisles for years, her sales measured in the millions, these days the broader self-help culture is mirroring Ms. Stoddard's themes. The cover lines of Oprah Winfrey's top-selling magazine O -- ''Making Connections. Finding Answers. Reviving Your Spirit'' -- are drawn straight from Stoddard land. Ms. Stoddard's 22nd book, ''Choose Happiness,'' due out next month from HarperCollins, might just be the right nourishment for a public hungry for bliss.</p>
        <p>Happiness, she has written again and again, is in life's details: a purple ribbon, Sunkist lemons on a waxed table, her husband's brightly colored boxer shorts. In her 20th book, ''Living Graciously'' (Morrow, 1996, $23), Ms. Stoddard describes painting a wall, and then hugging it. ''Yes! We bonded.''</p>
        <p>''To understand Alexandra, and the chord she strikes in her readers,'' said Nancy Evans, publisher of four of Ms. Stoddard's books in the late 1980's and a co-founder of iVillage, a women's media company, ''you have to go back to Anne Morrow Lindbergh and 'A Gift From the Sea.' ''</p>
        <p>''Here's this woman from a nice family who writes this small book about how life isn't as happy for us married working moms as it could be, and let's learn to take a breather and contemplate the waves,'' Ms. Evans said. ''It's the softer side of Betty Friedan, a wake-up call for a certain type of woman who wasn't going to storm the barricades.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stoddard tends to be lumped in the same category as that other lifestyle guru, Martha Stewart, but imagine Martha hugging a wall. Ms. Stewart is firmly ''lifestyle,'' a domestic clinician with no spiritual message. Ms. Stoddard -- part Diana Vreeland, part Deepak Chopra -- pours out directives bathed in that pink light, or ''the sort of lower-case spirituality that's been a burgeoning trend for the past five years,'' Ms. Evans said.</p>
        <p>In ''Choose Happiness,'' which is presented like all her books as niblets of reflections and prescriptions, Ms. Stoddard writes: ''Polishing a brass watering can, waxing an antique French provincial table -- putting all our notecards, stationery and postcards in an attractive box -- anything we do with care becomes a pleasure and a path to happiness now.''</p>
        <p>''This was a book I had to do,'' she said. ''Happiness has been given a bum rap. We're trained to think of others and do our duty. Unhappy people make me feel like I've done something wrong. If this is wrong, if what I'm doing is wrong, then I'm really on the wrong path.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stoddard stepped onto that path as a ''preppy little Christian living in Westport, Conn., long before Martha Stewart,'' she said, when an aunt took her on a world tour. ''We stayed in 50-cents-a-night hostels and before we left, my aunt, who was a social worker, made me read 54 books on Eastern philosophy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stoddard returned to attend the New York School of Interior Design. At a lecture given by Eleanor Brown, the principal in MacMillen, the decorating firm, Ms. Stoddard had ''an aha! moment'' and went to work for her. Ms. Stoddard married her tennis partner, and had two daughters, Alexandra and Brooke.</p>
        <p>When she stopped being a tennis player and started being a writer, they divorced. Two years later, Ms. Stoddard met and married a lawyer, Peter Brown. This tale, and these characters -- their trips to Europe, their breakfast rituals, their favorite colors -- are the touchstones of Ms. Stoddard's oeuvre.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously uplifting and gaga, ''Choose Happiness'' percolates with large thought bubbles in Ms. Stoddard's favorite colors, pink and blue (quite literally: the book's text is printed in bright blue and hot pink). Its charm is its effervescence, its batty energy: ''When you're over the top happy, skip!'' ''When I wear colorful stockings or socks it makes me feel more bouncy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stoddard is inspired by a friend's minitrampoline: ''Jumping on her round rebounder got me excited. I acquired one and am enjoying it enormously -- I feel invigorated, childlike and playful.'</p>
        <p>In all her books, which are written in longhand on lined paper, she describes the feel of the pen nib on the paper, the color of the ink flowing. Each book is stuffed with quotations. Rilke, Emerson, Bertrand Russell, Rollo May, Helen Keller, Bill Moyers, the Dalai Lama, Goethe and Oprah form a chorus of Big Thinkers, inspirational bold-face names, making Ms. Stoddard the Liz Smith of the self-help set.</p>
        <p>''I get up in the morning and I study,'' Ms. Stoddard said. ''I really want to be in the company of great minds.''</p>
        <p>''Here's the thing: I don't want to go to a monastery,'' she continued, hazel eyes widening. ''The buddha walked away from his wife while she was sleeping. I don't want to go anywhere, I don't want to leave anybody behind. Happiness is right here, right now, in this world, in this room. I am happiest wherever it is that I am. My readers are living life, they're picking up their kids, they're getting themselves to work, they're volunteering. I'm not asking them to give up anything, or take up anything.''</p>
        <p>This last point she makes with emphasis because of the comparisons to Martha Stewart. ''We don't have to downgrade one person to uplift another,'' said Ms. Stoddard, who barely paused to answer the implicit question. ''What we do is so different. When we don't compare, we see she's doing her thing and I'm doing my part. I don't want people to be perfectionists. When you're happy, when you're inspired and on a path, then you can do whatever you want to do. You can do crafts, or you can do Martha, or you can do nothing. Martha has her niche and she does a great job, but she ain't no philosopher.''</p>
        <p>And she certainly is no wall hugger.</p>
