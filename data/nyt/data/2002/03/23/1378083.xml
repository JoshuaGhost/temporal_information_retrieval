        <p>Stockwell Day, the conservative politician who helped form the Canadian Alliance party two years ago, has lost an election to regain the party's leadership. Initial hopes that Mr. Day would unite Canada's right-wing voters dissolved after the party's poor showing in the November 2000 general election, and public gaffes and defections led Mr. Day to resign as the party's head in December. In the vote for a new leader, Stephen Harper, a former member of Parliament from the Reform Party, got 55 percent and Mr. Day 37.5 percent. Mr. Harper will now seek a seat in Parliament.</p>
