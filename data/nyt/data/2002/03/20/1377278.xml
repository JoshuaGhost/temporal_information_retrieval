        <p>The Air Force secretary and the White House spokesman defended plans today to reduce combat flights over American cities and end round-the-clock fighter patrols over New York, saying the steps were justified by the increased security at airports and aboard jetliners.</p>
        <p>Neither official discussed details of how or when the patrols will be reduced, but both said much had changed in airline security since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>The Air Force secretary, James G. Roche, cited such developments as reinforced cockpit doors, increased crew training, the presence of federal marshals on flights and the stringent screening of passengers and baggage as reducing the need to rely so extensively on the air patrols.</p>
        <p>The security measures include almost 200 dogs distributed among several dozen airports across the country. By next year, the federal government hopes to have 300 dogs at 80 airports. A lot of dogs are needed because they can work for only about an hour at a time before becoming ineffective. Each dog costs about $40,000 a year, including training and retraining.</p>
        <p>The nation's cities, including New York, will still be guarded by jet fighters sent aloft at various times and by others on alert, and these patrols will be ''adjusted according to threat,'' Dr. Roche said.</p>
        <p>''We want to have more of a mix,'' he said in an interview,  ''much more randomness and much more keeping up the security but not informing any potential opponent that, you know, that Detroit is empty today.''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's decision to stop the 24-hour patrols over New York City was intensely criticized by leading Democratic lawmakers from the city and the state, who voiced concerns about security and asked why round-the-clock fighter protection was still being provided for Washington.</p>
        <p>In outlining their plans over the weekend, Pentagon officials said there were more efficient ways to ensure air safety than relying on the patrols, which military officers say divert personnel and planes from other missions and reduce the life of aircraft.</p>
        <p>Fighter aircraft from the Navy and the Air Force have flown more than 19,000 combat air patrols over American cities since Sept. 11, at a cost of more than $500 million, officials said.</p>
        <p>At the White House today, Ari Fleischer, the chief spokesman, said that ''not all the decisions are final on this.''</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that will always be reviewed to provide the greatest protection for the American people, wherever they are,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''And that's based on intelligence information; it's based on threat analysis; it's based on a whole series of items, including the fact that since Sept. 11, domestic security -- as any traveler can tell you -- has been changed.''</p>
