        <p>For at least a decade, Afghanistan has been a country without an army, unless the ragtag militias that served as the shock force of the Taliban could be counted as one, with their Korans and Kalashnikovs and zeal to put a nation of 20 million people in servitude to a wrathful God.</p>
        <p>But in the past 10 days, a new national army has begun to take shape at an old Soviet military base on mud flats in the eastern outskirts of Kabul. So far, it is not much of a force, only 600 men in donated Turkish camouflage fatigues on a six-week course of drills familiar to any military recruit. Under NATO instructors, they are learning, with surging enthusiasm but not yet much in the way of boot camp discipline: to march in time, to strip, assemble and fire assault rifles, to clear land mines, to read maps and dispense first aid and maintain trucks and disarm prisoners.</p>

        <p>For at least a decade, Afghanistan has been a country without an army, unless the ragtag militias that served as the shock force of the Taliban could be counted as one, with their Korans and Kalashnikovs and zeal to put a nation of 20 million people in servitude to a wrathful God.</p>
        <p>But in the past 10 days, a new national army has begun to take shape at an old Soviet military base on mud flats in the eastern outskirts of Kabul. So far, it is not much of a force, only 600 men in donated Turkish camouflage fatigues on a six-week course of drills familiar to any military recruit. Under NATO instructors, they are learning, with surging enthusiasm but not yet much in the way of boot camp discipline: to march in time, to strip, assemble and fire assault rifles, to clear land mines, to read maps and dispense first aid and maintain trucks and disarm prisoners.</p>
        <p>It is a small beginning, full of the quirkiness and poignancy of post-Taliban Afghanistan. But from the basic training that went on display today, the country's new leaders hope, eventually, to build a credible state. Over time, perhaps not for five years or more, the plan is to assemble an army of perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 troops, with modern weapons and loyalty to that other part of the Afghan national dream, a democratically elected, multiethnic government. By then, the ambition is that the era of warlordism, of thuggish militia bosses who now hold much of Afghanistan in thrall, will be history.</p>
        <p>Whether the vision outlined by Afghan commanders and NATO officers overseeing the training is realized -- or collapses in a new chapter of the civil war that began Afghanistan's descent into chaos 23 years ago -- will depend on many things. Among them is the speed with which enough of the new army can be trained, and, linked to that, whether the United States and its European allies, effectively the trustees of Afghanistan's welfare since the Taliban were toppled by American bombing in November, are prepared to help sustain the new national government against warlord challenges until it can sustain itself.</p>
        <p>Many in Afghanistan fear it may turn out to be a close-run thing, hinging on an issue now being thrashed out in the highest councils in Washington and London and Paris and other capitals whose governments have allied themselves to the American war on terrorism. The issue is whether to accede to the increasingly insistent pleas from Hamid Karzai, leader of the pro-American interim government in Kabul, to expand the 4,500-man international force now deployed in Kabul across Afghanistan, increasing its numbers to perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 troops and extending its stay for as long as it takes for the new government to grow strong to assert its own authority.</p>
        <p>With the United States and several European allies hesitant to step that deep into Afghanistan's affairs -- and into what some pessimists fear could become a quagmire -- nothing has been settled. But for a few hours this morning, the furrowed brows of some of the men now charged with governing seemed to uncrease a little as they watched the first battalion of the new army, envisaged as a palace guard for the new government, going through its paces. One of these men, Gen. Asif Delawar, appointed chief of staff of the new army even before it had its first recruits, summed up the spirit of the moment when he reviewed the men on their very first parade.</p>
        <p>''Brave fighters of Afghanistan, courageous survivors of our long resistance against tyranny and chaos, I salute you here as the standard-bearers for our new national army,'' he said. ''It is a sacred task, and a privilege, for to you has been entrusted the responsibility of retrieving our national honor and dignity.'' He had barely finished when the rows of men before him erupted with choruses of ''Allah-u Akbar! Allah-u Akbar!'' -- God is great! -- the same cry, of course, that less than four months ago was the rallying call amid these same crumbling barracks in Kabul's Pul-i-Charkhi district of some of the Taliban fighters who imposed their puritanical form of Islam on Kabul.</p>
        <p>Keen observers at today's display included American officers helping prepare for the next phase of the new army's training, one to be led by the United States. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, among other senior administration officials, has expressed reluctance to expand the international force, saying a better way to contribute to Afghanistan's long-term security is to help in the creation of a new national army and police force. To that end, Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander of the American war effort in Afghanistan, sent a 22-man team to Kabul last week under one of his deputies, Maj. Gen. Charles Campbell, to assess what would be involved in training the new army.</p>
        <p>With the assessment team's report under review in Washington, American officers were wary of questions touching the political issue, as defined by Mr. Karzai and other Afghan leaders: whether a new army can be assembled quickly enough to make a Western commitment to training the new army a credible alternative to expanding the international force. That, said Col. Mike Weimer of the United States Rangers, deputy head of a military cooperation team at the American Embassy, would depend on Afghanistan's own ''vision'' for the army. ''It will go as fast as the Afghans can make it happen,'' he said. ''And it will depend on the end-state -- how big an army do they want, and what do they want it to do?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karzai has said the new government's ambitious development plans, financed by a $4.5 billion development fund pledged by the world's wealthiest nations at a conference in Tokyo in January, could come to nothing unless there is the ''security'' necessary for rebuilding schools and hospitals and roads -- and to make possible a presence across the country for the government, which currently has little authority anywhere outside Kabul. Without the loyalties that development of that kind will create among Afghans, Mr. Karzai has implied, the national government will have little with which to counter the kind of ethnic and tribal passions that warlords seek to kindle.</p>
        <p>Sympathy for Mr. Karzai's view was implied by the British commander of the multinational brigade, Maj. Gen. John McColl, when he was asked today how long the building of the new army might take.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, it's not something that's going to happen in a heartbeat,'' he said. ''You're talking probably years.'' But General McColl, answerable to a government in London that has said it is reluctant to make a major commitment to the multinational force beyond June, when the force's current mandate expires, said the issue might not be as clear-cut as protagonists for a more robust multinational brigade have suggested. ''I'd dispute the suggestion that you have to wait until the new national army is completely trained before it can play a role in providing security for the country,'' he said.</p>
