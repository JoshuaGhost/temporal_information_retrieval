        <p>Melissa Block and Stefan Fatsis were married on Thursday by Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court, in his Manhattan chambers. Yesterday, Jonathan Hock, a friend of the couple, led a celebration at Gedney Farm in New Marlborough, Mass.</p>
        <p>Ms. Block, who is 40 and is keeping her name, is a correspondent in Manhattan for National Public Radio.  She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard and was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Geneva.  She is a daughter of Sally and Daniel Block of Old Chatham, N.Y., where her parents, now retired, owned the Handcrafters, a crafts store.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatsis, 38, is a sports reporter in Manhattan for The Wall Street Journal and a contributor to ''All Things Considered'' on NPR. He is also a competitive Scrabble player and the author of ''Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2001). He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a son of Anita Fatsis of Pelham, N.Y., and the late Michael T. Fatsis, who was the president of the Argonaut Trading Agency, a former shipping company in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatsis proposed last September over a four-hour, seven-course lunch at L'Arp√®ge, a busy Paris restaurant. As the couple finished dessert and lingered over tea, Mr. Fatsis pulled out a bag containing a pair of Scrabble racks and two sets of tiles, which he then arranged in alphabetical order before Ms. Block.</p>
        <p>The first read, ILLOUWY; the second, AEMMRRY. Tears welling in her eyes, Ms. Block quickly unscrambled the letters and turned the racks around to face Mr. Fatsis. He then offered a more formal proposal, to which she nodded and cried out her approval.</p>
