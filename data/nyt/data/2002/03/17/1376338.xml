        <p>Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip, (631) 224-5402. Through April 7.</p>
        <p>By defining sewing as broadly as possible for this show, the Islip Art Museum's curator, Karen Shaw, has rejected preconceived ideas about craft, art and the appropriate use of materials. In a culture where men who sew are tailors, embroidery is women's work and the only fine-art fabric is canvas with a painting on it, the 10 artists here offer some challenging alternatives.</p>

        <p>'Sew Fine'</p>
        <p>Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip, (631) 224-5402. Through April 7.</p>
        <p>By defining sewing as broadly as possible for this show, the Islip Art Museum's curator, Karen Shaw, has rejected preconceived ideas about craft, art and the appropriate use of materials. In a culture where men who sew are tailors, embroidery is women's work and the only fine-art fabric is canvas with a painting on it, the 10 artists here offer some challenging alternatives.</p>
        <p>Angelo Filomeno's machine-stitched silk panels use lustrous thread, like the real gold and silver woven into royal robes, to enrich and intensify his symbolic imagery. But that imagery is an unorthodox combination of anatomical detail and free-form abstraction, with its symbolism veiled in subjectivity. The needlework is a labor of love, but the object of that devotion is curiously elusive.</p>
        <p>Joseph Heidecker, on the other hand, starts with reality and moves toward fantasy by creating embroidered and collaged disguises for people in old photographs. His subjects, usually anonymous, acquire masks and garments that alter their identities; for example, an unknown woman is recast as a heroic George Washington lookalike. While Mr. Heidecker's Surrealist strategy is familiar, his use of stitchery is not.</p>
        <p>Oriane Stender also starts with pictorial raw material, often from printed paper multiples like postage stamps and dollar bills, which she cuts up and sews back together in new configurations.</p>
        <p>In her ''Marilyn/Mondrian Quilt,'' reproductions of two art works combine to produce a third that comments wryly on the supposed dichotomy between abstraction and representation. This small assemblage is nothing like a conventional quilt, any more than Indigo Som's embroidered silk rectangles are like conventional samplers.</p>
        <p>Instead of using thread to fashion words and pictures, Ms. Som allows it to wander freely in and out of translucent fabric, which itself is mounted loose and away from the wall. The lovely little banners cast cryptic shadows that are both delightful and puzzling.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Christa Maiwald's stitched pictures come closest to what one thinks of as embroidery, but both the medium and the message are not quite.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maiwald's ''Adolescents'' series is a snapshot album of teenage behavior, rendered in delicate, fragile thread that is often frayed and ragged at the edges, like the emotions on display.</p>
        <p>'Threads of Tradition'  Smithtown Township Arts Council, Mills Pond House, 660 Route 25A, St. James, (631) 862-6575. Through April 6.</p>
        <p>Subtitled ''Contemporary Innovations,'' this exhibition aims to celebrate needlecrafts heritage in works that also reflect new attitudes and approaches. But except for one print, all the pieces are by women, acknowledging Women's History Month but, unlike the Islip show, reinforcing the notion that fabric-based art is female territory.</p>
        <p>Among more than 80 pieces on view, many of the most notable are quilted and patchwork designs. In ''Weave Structure No. 2,'' Catherine Dwore disrupts a strict horizontal and vertical grid by using organically patterned materials and circular quilting to counter the right-angle geometry.  Similarly, Janet Kurjan skews the rectangular building blocks of her quilt, ''Wildfire I,'' in which glowing colors melt as if liquified by internal heat.</p>
        <p>''It's About Time,'' a paper quilt by Zelda Tanenbaum, uses clock and watch faces interspersed with biblical quotations to comment on the mutability of momentary phenomena and, paradoxically, the continuum of responses to time's passage. Judith Plotner also refers to the past's influence on the present in ''In My Mother's Closet,'' a memorial quilt incorporating snapshots, lettering and scraps of fabric that expresses  personal nostalgia without resorting to sentimentality.</p>
        <p>'Expo XXI Winners'  B. J. Spoke Gallery, 299 Main Street, Huntington, (631) 549-5106. Through March 31.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the five winners of this year's national competition, judged by Dana Miller, an assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, include two artists who have been chosen before: James Watts of California and Timothy Andrew Kussow of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kussow's animal effigies, also shown here in 1999, are made of steel rods bent and welded into outlines, like three-dimensional contour drawings. Effective as schematic representations, they are removed from their familiar surroundings and placed in anomalous positions; for example, the turquoise turtle and pink rabbit are mounted on rolling hand carts. Shiny steel birds impaled on metal rods, their feet still clenched as if gripping tree branches, and skeletal silver trout -- literally fish out of water -- are whimsical but slightly disquieting reflections of their counterparts in nature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watts, a 1997 winner, is exhibiting heavily textured paintings of otherworldly scenes with a peculiar radiance. Framed in darkness and silhouetted against shimmering skies, isolated structures loom up in desolate landscapes. Sacrificial altars for the worship of forgotten deities and the mysterious ruins of defunct cultures are called to mind, with the implication that ancient meanings are encoded in their shadowy forms. The artist provokes curiosity and invites speculation without offering tangible clues to interpretation.</p>
        <p>Laura Amussen's sculptures have a similar ritualistic quality. Made of bunched broom, pine cones and other organic materials, they are scented with cinnamon, an appealing and slightly intoxicating effect that reinforces the impression of animistic purpose.</p>
        <p>Paintings by Roald Bradstock reflect his background as an athlete, combining sports imagery with abstract patterning designed to represent the energy generated by athletes in action. Sadly, the results are far too decorative and formulaic to express the dynamism he seeks.</p>
