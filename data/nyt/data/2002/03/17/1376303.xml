        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''Airlines Put Passengers on Forced Diets'' (Feb. 10): To heck with airlines' gelatinous pasta and so-called beef meals. To heck also with airports' greasy fast food. Just give us room to have a picnic!</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''Airlines Put Passengers on Forced Diets'' (Feb. 10): To heck with airlines' gelatinous pasta and so-called beef meals. To heck also with airports' greasy fast food. Just give us room to have a picnic!</p>
        <p>On a five-hour flight to Kauai from Los Angeles, I pulled out black bread, smoked salmon and cream cheese, just as the guy in front pushed his seat back to the max, and into my face.</p>
        <p>Trapped in front and hemmed in on both sides, I doggedly laid out my smorgasbord. Before I could take a bite, my window seatmate squirted me in the eye while peeling an orange, and the man on the aisle opened his paper with a flourish that sent my sandwich skidding into my lap.</p>
        <p>The flight attendants lumbered up with the drinks cart long after I'd choked down the last dry pumpernickel crumb. My water bottle (at my feet in a carry-on) was inaccessible thanks to the intrusive seat back.</p>
        <p>If the airlines ceased to serve their awful meals, they could use the monetary savings to give us enough elbow room to feed ourselves.</p>
