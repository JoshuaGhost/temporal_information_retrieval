        <p>Lori Michelle Smith, a daughter of Sandy and Dennis Smith of Springfield, N.J., is to be married today to Howard Seth Weiner, a son of Barbara and Harvey Weiner of Wynnewood, Pa. Rabbi Joshua Goldstein is to officiate at the Crystal Plaza, a caterer in Livingston, N.J.</p>
        <p>The bride is a speech and language therapist at the St. Francis de Sales School for the Deaf in Brooklyn. Her father is a partner in Clancy, Callahan &amp; Smith, a law firm in Roseland, N.J. Her mother is the Chatham, N.J., public schools' drug and alcohol counselor.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom is a criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan. His mother is a guidance counselor at the Hillside Elementary School in Berwyn, Pa. His father is the vice president for health affairs at Eagleville Hospital in Eagleville, Pa.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith and Mr. Weiner, both 31, went to George Washington University as undergraduates, but met there only once. She later earned a master's degree in speech and language pathology from Gallaudet University, and he received a degree from Brooklyn Law School.</p>
        <p>They did not see each other again until eight years after graduation, on Memorial Day 2000, when Mr. Weiner found himself standing behind Ms. Smith in line at a bakery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty sure I recognized her,'' he recalled. ''Ordinarily, I'd sit back and say, 'I'll talk to her the next time,' But then I thought: 'What are the chances that I'll see her again?' ''</p>
        <p>He asked if she was the same Lori he had met in college. After a few minutes, he grew bolder. ''I grabbed her left hand and said, 'I see there is no ring,' '' he remembered.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith found his approach ''bold, but not macho'' and also ''refreshing.''</p>
        <p>Before the end of their brief conversation, he said, ''Maybe we'll go for a drink sometime,'' and he asked for her phone number. ''Turned out she gave me the right one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I remember thinking when I saw him on Memorial Day that this had happened all on its own -- no setups or blind dates,'' Ms. Smith said. ''After our meeting, I remember skipping home.''</p>
