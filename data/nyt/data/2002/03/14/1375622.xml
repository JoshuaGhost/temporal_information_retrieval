        <p>Use of stock to finance deals in 1990's is haunting telecommunications companies in Europe; companies used stock options to finance many acquisitions at what now appear to be inflated valuations; companies issued options giving stockholder right to sell, and issuer obligation to buy, shares at future date, often at fixed price; while shares were heading higher, options seemed like smart move; now that share prices have sunk to fraction of their former levels and telecommunications companies tend to be short on cash, companies face dismal prospect of having to buy their shares or those of another company often at premium to market price; if options are exercised, and most come due in next year or two, that could add millions in liabilities to companies already struggling under heavy debt; deals, many of which are off-balance-sheet items, also go to heart of debate about corporate disclosure that has been gathering intensity in Europe in wake of Enron Corp collapse; France Telecom could end up owing 10 billion euros ($8.75 billion) over next two years because of its extensive use of stock options (M)</p>

        <p>The deals were phenomena of the bull market, signed when chief executives believed the only way stocks could go was up. Now, the deals are coming back to haunt the telecommunications companies that relied on them to help finance an expansion that looks wildly optimistic.</p>
        <p>Though telecommunications companies are not alone in relying on options to protect against swings in share prices, they stand out because they used the options to finance so many acquisitions at what now appear to be inflated valuations.</p>
        <p>In a dizzying buying spree, companies like France Télécom, Deutsche Telekom and Telecom Italia often paid with a mix of cash and stock. Because telecommunications assets were so sought after in the late 1990's, sellers were in a position to demand a kind of insurance to protect them if the shares they received later declined in value.</p>
        <p>So the telecommunications companies issued options giving the holder the right to sell, and the issuer the obligation to buy, shares at a future date, often at a fixed price.</p>
        <p>While shares were heading higher, the options seemed like a smart move. Now that share prices have sunk to a fraction of their former levels and the telecommunications companies tend to be short on cash,  companies face the dismal prospect of having to buy their shares or those of another company -- buying out a partner for instance -- often at a premium to the market price.</p>
        <p>If these options are exercised, and most come due in the next year or two, that could add millions in liabilities to companies already struggling under heavy debt. And this could cause their credit ratings to suffer, making borrowings more expensive.</p>
        <p>The deals, many of which are off-balance-sheet items, also go to the heart of a debate about corporate disclosure that has been gathering intensity in Europe in the wake of the Enron collapse.</p>
        <p>The telecommunications companies say the deals were properly disclosed in annual reports and filings with regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors counter that some terms were ambiguous, making it difficult to gauge the financial impact of the transactions.</p>
        <p>''These deals come under the heading of 'Potential Bad Surprises,' '' said Michael Stam of Fortis Investment Management in Paris. Companies ''did not explicitly lay out the risks if the strategy went wrong.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps no company made more use of options than France Télécom, which could end up owing 10 billion euros ($8.75 billion) over the next two years, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>France Télécom must pay Vodafone 4.97 billion euros by March 25, to buy back shares issued to Vodafone as payment for Orange, a French mobile phone company it bought in 2000.</p>
        <p>Gerhard Schmid, the chief of the German mobile phone company MobilCom, can force France Télécom to buy a 33 percent stake in MobilCom under certain circumstances, including one that currently pertains -- a stalemate between the companies over business strategies. More important, such a deal would require France Télécom to consolidate MobilCom's 6 billion euros of debt on its balance sheet.</p>
        <p>Institutional investors in NTL, a British cable company, could force France Télécom, an NTL shareholder, to pay $1.1 billion in March 2003 to buy their NTL shares.</p>
        <p>And in June, E.On, a German utility, can require France Télécom to buy back 103 million Orange shares for 950 million euros, a stake currently worth 792 million euros.</p>
        <p>Nilou du Castel, a spokeswoman for France Télécom, said that the Credit Suisse analysis was a ''worst case scenario,'' and added that the deals and options were all disclosed in company filings with the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>But she acknowledged that additional liabilities, coupled with an expected reduction in the value of some investments, could hinder France Télécom's ability to reduce its 65 billion euros in debt, perhaps forcing the company to sell assets it had not previously considered selling. The company is expected to report annual results next Thursday.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom is in a similar options bind. Recently, it was forced to pay DaimlerChrysler 4.6 billion euros for a stake in a software company they jointly owned.</p>
        <p>And it may have to pay 1.6 billion euros to buy out its partners in Ben Nederland Holding, a Dutch mobile operator. Hans Ehnert, a Deutsche Telekom spokesman, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Telecom Italia also could be forced to buy shares, in a subsidiary. When Chase Manhattan, now part of J. P. Morgan Chase, advised Telecom Italia on its acquisition of the Internet service provider Seat Pagine Gialle two years ago, the bank received an option to sell 711 million Seat shares back to Telecom Italia in April 2003 for 4.20 euros each.</p>
        <p>In a recent press release, Telecom Italia said the agreement had since been revised, delaying the exercise date to December 2005 and reducing the price to 3.40 euros each. The shares closed Wednesday at 87 euro cents.</p>
