        <p>The scene: The St. James Theater on West 44th Street. Closing moments of the 300-and-somethingth and final performance of NATHAN LANE and MATTHEW BRODERICK in ''The Producers,'' a musical about putting on a musical that has been Broadway's biggest hit in years.</p>
        <p>MR. LANE AND MR. BRODERICK [sing]: . . . The producers, Leo and Max!</p>
        <p>Curtain. The audience rises. Loud cheers for various cast members as they take their bows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick, as themselves, albeit still dressed as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, come out. General roar ensues for about a minute. Mr. Lane and Mr. Broderick touch their hats, then grab hands.</p>
        <p>MEL BROOKS, the show's creator, presents Mr. Lane with a bouquet of red roses. SUSAN STROMAN, the director and choreographer, does the same for Mr. Broderick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane wipes an eye, coughs into his hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broderick touches the brim of his hat.</p>
        <p>MS. STROMAN: Nathan, Matthew, we just wanted to tell you how much we love you. And to thank you for making us laugh for an entire year. But just remember when you're done with your movies and TV projects to come on back.</p>
        <p>MR. BROOKS: Ditto. You guys have given this little handsome Jew the greatest third act of his little old life. You've been beyond -- you've been surprisingly good. O.K. folks.</p>
        <p>Cast sings the coda, ''Goodbye'':</p>
        <p>Thanks for coming to see our show</p>
        <p>Sad to tell you we got to go</p>
        <p>Grab your hat and head for the door</p>
        <p>In case you didn't notice</p>
        <p>There ain't no more.</p>
        <p>If you like our show tell everyone, but</p>
        <p>If you think it stinks</p>
        <p>Keep your big mouth shut!</p>
        <p>We're glad you came but we have to shout</p>
        <p>Adi√≥s, Au revoir, Wiedersehen, Ta-Ta-Ta,</p>
        <p>Goodbye, get lost, get out!</p>
        <p>Curtain down, house lights on.</p>
        <p>AUDIENCE MEMBER JODI BERMAN OF CHERRY HILL, N.J.: If you can't see opening night, closing is the best.</p>
        <p>USHER: O.K., folks, T-shirts, souvenirs and headset returns, checked packages in the main lobby. Quickest exit is left at the foot of the stairs.</p>
        <p>Exeunt</p>
