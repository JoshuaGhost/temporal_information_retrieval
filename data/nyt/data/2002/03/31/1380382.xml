        <p>Two years ago, Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina did all he could to help John McCain win his state's Republican primary. But in the end, George W. Bush carried the state, effectively ending Mr. McCain's presidential hopes.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Graham is running for the Senate seat being vacated by Strom Thurmond, and lo, on Wednesday President Bush showed up in South Carolina to campaign for Mr. Graham, raising $1 million for him in the process.</p>
        <p>Call it practical politics. Or a marriage of political necessity. Or the better part of political valor. Whatever it was, Mr. Bush went straight to point. ''Frankly,'' he said, Mr. Graham seated at his side, ''it's in my interest that he get elected to the United States Senate. Because I've got a lot of work I want to do. It's in the nation's interest.''</p>
        <p>Considering that Democrats hold a one-seat edge in the Senate, that work may very well not get done if the Thurmond seat -- he is a Republican -- goes Democratic this fall.</p>
        <p>There was a time when it seemed unlikely any Democrat could take Mr. Graham and, indeed, no fewer than eight shied away from the race. But then Alex Sanders, a colorful, popular former lawmaker, judge and college president, jumped in.</p>
        <p>In a few weeks, he raised $1 million in campaign cash, and with it Democratic hopes. What once was considered not much of a contest is now rated one to watch -- which the White House is obviously doing.</p>
        <p>''Sanders has come on strong,'' Henry McMaster, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said. ''We're in a horse race.''</p>
