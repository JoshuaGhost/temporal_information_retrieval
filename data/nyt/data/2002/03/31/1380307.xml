        <p>In this election season, Gov. George E. Pataki has elaborately courted the state's minority voters. The self-proclaimed ''governor of all the people'' has protested the Navy bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, mourned the dead in the Dominican Republic, kissed the governor of Puerto Rico and attended the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus annual dinner for the first time in his seven years in office.</p>
        <p>But now several black and Latino groups are presenting what is, to them, a litmus test of Mr. Pataki's sincerity. They want the governor to veto the State Senate's redistricting plan, which they say is aggressively unfair to minority voters.</p>
        <p>A Republican governor might seem an unlikely ally in a struggle to win what are likely to be Democratic seats. But Mr. Pataki has given civil rights groups reason to think that a veto is a possibility.</p>
        <p>''Governor Pataki is interested in seeing that a maximum number of minority districts are contained in the final maps,'' his director of intergovernmental relations, Leslie A. Maeby, told the New York Voting Rights Consortium, which includes black, Latino and Asian-American groups, at a forum on redistricting in January. The governor himself has said the Legislature's plan is unfair, but has not specified his concerns.</p>
        <p>Such comments have raised expectations. ''If he's got anything positive to say to the community regarding his intentions, then he has to put up right now,'' said Lucía Gómez, the civic participation program coordinator at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, a member of the consortium. ''We don't want to be questioning his leadership on our issues. This is not a good time for him.''</p>
        <p>But a veto would be difficult for the governor. It would mean forfeiting the interests of the Republican majority in the Senate, who can ill afford to lose any of the 35 out of 61 seats they hold. And such a move would almost certainly sour Mr. Pataki's relationship with Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader.</p>
        <p>''The loss of a majority in the Senate is something desperately to be feared, and Pataki has a clear interest in not having both houses with a Democratic majority during his term,'' said Richard Emery, a prominent civil rights lawyer who is opposing the Senate plan in court. ''He's in a terrible conflict.''</p>
        <p>The minority groups have focused mainly on two areas: Long Island, where they say district lines have systematically split clusters of black and Hispanic voters for decades, and Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, where, they say, there are enough Hispanic residents for an additional district whose Hispanic majority would be largely Dominican. Dominicans have already won a City Council seat and an Assembly seat, in part because of previous redistricting plans.</p>
        <p>The Republican plan, which will be revised before the vote, which officials say is set for April 8 or 10 -- redraws the lines in Queens and Brooklyn to create an additional Hispanic district and an additional black district. But in Upper Manhattan it divides the Dominican community, centered in Washington Heights and the west Bronx, among districts held by three Democrats: Eric T. Schneiderman, whose political base is the Upper West Side, David A. Paterson of Harlem, and Olga A. Mendez, whose base is East Harlem.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mendez, the co-chairwoman of Democrats for Pataki, said she had seen -- and supports -- the revised Senate plan for Upper Manhattan and the west Bronx because the lines have been redrawn to create a district that could eventually elect a Dominican-American.</p>
        <p>The Republican plan leaves largely intact the mostly white district held by Senator Guy J. Velella, which looks something like a doughnut that has had a bite taken out of it and then been run over by a car. Until recently, when Senator Pedro Espada Jr. announced he was switching parties, Mr. Velella was the Bronx's only elected Republican.</p>
        <p>The minority groups, allied with the Senate's Democratic minority, have submitted an alternative plan for the area whose districts look persuasively compact by comparison. Yet both plans find justification among the principles of redistricting: supporters of the alternative plan say it protects what courts have called communities of interest, while the Republicans say continuity of representation trumps other concerns.</p>
        <p>More difficult to justify, perhaps, is the population discrepancy in the Senate majority plan, which rounds up the number of upstate, predominantly Republican districts and rounds down the number of city districts, where minorities and Democrats are concentrated.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the average population of the city's districts is 313,337 and the average population of upstate districts is 297,328. While the difference is just within the range permitted by the courts, it is more than twice that of the 1992 redistricting plan. Asked about the difference, Thomas Dunham, a spokesman for Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who heads the Senate's redistricting task force, said: ''It's legal. What more do you want?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Emery, the lawyer challenging the plan, predicts that it will not hold up in court without substantial changes. ''They have done every single conceivable thing to preserve the majority at the cost of any appearance of fairness,'' he said. ''And it is as a result extremely vulnerable and a political hot potato.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of the Republican plan, like Senator Espada, who switched parties, say that minority communities benefit in economically and ethnically diverse districts, and that the fight for more minority districts is a thinly disguised grab for more Democratic districts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman, the Democratic senator on the Upper West Side, acknowledges that there is no lack of agendas when it comes to redistricting. ''But at least our agenda is consistent with demographics,'' he said, ''because the state is overwhelmingly Democratic.''</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is the Senate should reflect the people of the State of New York,'' he said. ''There are a lot of personal and individual agendas, but there are also public policy agendas, and it is unfair to lump them all together.''</p>
        <p>Despite the plan's advantages for Republicans, though, the Democrat-led Assembly is not likely to attack it. The Assembly wants the freedom to pursue its own redistricting plan without the Senate's interference. So opponents of each plan have two hopes: a closed-door agreement that leads to substantial revisions, or a veto by the governor.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of a veto is impossible to determine. Several Republican strategists, high-ranking party members and members of the Pataki administration would not comment or said they were not privy to the governor's intentions.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo denounced the redistricting plan even as he signed it, leaving it to the United States Justice Department to create an additional Hispanic district in the city. But Ms. Maeby, of the Pataki administration, promised that the governor would be more involved than his predecessor.</p>
        <p>Some political strategists point out that a veto would not be a one-sided blow to the Republican Party because it would be good for Assembly Republicans, who are unhappy with proposed district lines there. Although a veto would be a powerful gesture to black and Latino voters, Governor Pataki has indicated he would prefer that both plans be substantially revised before it comes to that, a spokesman said last week.</p>
        <p>Both houses will soon release revised plans, but several lawmakers said the governor had not been involved in negotiations leading up to them.</p>
        <p>While hopes of a veto run high among some opponents of the Senate Republican plan, others are skeptical. ''Too often people of color have given credit and support for a rumor,'' Senator Paterson of Harlem said, ''only to find out later that it's a mirage.''</p>
