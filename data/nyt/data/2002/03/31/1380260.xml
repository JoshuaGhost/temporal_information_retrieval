        <p>Most Americans want to leave an inheritance; the trouble is, they usually never bother to discuss their legacy plans with their heirs, according to the results of a survey released last week.</p>
        <p>AARP and Zurich Scudder Investments questioned 1,000 adults late last year and found that while 72 percent believed that it was important to pass on their assets, only 44 percent had developed an asset inventory. About 40 percent said they had discussed their plans with those who will inherit their property. Sharing information ''is fundamental to ensuring your legacy plans are carried out,'' said Jim Thompson, director of shareholder education at the AARP Investment Program.</p>
