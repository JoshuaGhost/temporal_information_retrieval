        <p>AT least a million people have been caught in the downsizing wave that has swept corporate America over the last year or so, and some experts say the reductions may not be complete, even though the economy is recovering from a recession.</p>
        <p>The most frequent way of cutting jobs has been through layoffs, but some employees, particularly those who have been around for many years, have been offered buyout packages that often encourage early retirement.</p>
        <p>If you receive an offer, you can refuse it, but you run the risk of being laid off eventually if too few people accept the buyouts.</p>
        <p>Avery E. Neumark, partner in charge of employee benefits and executive compensation at Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin &amp; Company, an accounting firm in New York, says it may be wise to try negotiating the best buyout deal possible, then look for another job if you are not ready to retire. Severance packages in layoffs, he said, tend to be less generous than in buyouts, with fewer weeks' pay at termination and fewer other benefits.</p>
        <p>When it comes to layoffs, Mr. Neumark said, ''sometimes, you don't have a choice.''</p>
        <p>Buyout candidates who are not ready to retire should ask their current employers for outplacement services to help them find other work, benefits experts say. Another important consideration is health insurance; employees should negotiate for continued coverage, they say.</p>
        <p>Of course, some employers may not want to bargain. ''For a company, the best practice is not to negotiate,'' said Diane Lerner, a senior compensation consultant in New York for Watson Wyatt, the consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Enhanced packages for individual employees, she said, could affect employee morale and even lead to litigation.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Alan M. Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm in Manhattan, said, ''In the real world there is often room to negotiate, even with companies that say a package is nonnegotiable.''</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Johnson said, an employee who has a company car may negotiate to keep it or buy it from the company at book value. Or an employee who has unused sick time or who worked on holidays might say to his boss, ''Two more weeks would make me whole.'' A worker who is taking care of a sick parent might explain the situation and win extra weeks or months of employment because of hardship, he said, especially when the downsizing is being done in waves, not all at once.</p>
        <p>''If you want something, ask for it,'' Mr. Johnson said, though he advised workers to think through their needs for 24 hours before making a request. ''Ask for what is important, and ask once. Don't make serial requests. This is not a time to be humble or shy, but be courteous.''</p>
        <p>You should also be realistic, he added. ''Generally the advice is: Get the most you can and get on with your life.''</p>
        <p>THAT is what Tracy Sylvester, 35, of Baltimore, did last summer when Sylvan Learning Systems, where he worked in information technology, decided to outsource his job and offered severance packages to him and his technology colleagues. ''They offered me what I thought was a very fair package,'' he said, adding that a friend who is a lawyer agreed. Mr. Sylvester had worked for Sylvan about a year and was given several weeks' salary and outplacement services and was allowed to keep his stock options.</p>
        <p>He said some colleagues had negotiated for improvements in their packages but that he ''was far more concerned about maintaining a good relationship, good recommendations,'' than haggling for two more weeks.</p>
        <p>He said he spent the summer looking for a job, to no avail. ''One of the things that put things in perspective for me was Sept. 11,'' he said. ''I realized, 'A lot of people are worse off than you -- you're healthy and still have money in your bank account.' ''</p>
        <p>He became an independent consultant and is now putting in a new computer system for the College of Notre Dame, in Baltimore. The project will take at least two years.</p>
        <p>Not everyone who expects to receive a buyout gets one, or at least the one they want. Jean James, 42, of Glen Ridge, N.J., who worked several years at Quest Diagnostics, selling clinical laboratory services like blood tests to doctors, was recruited by a smaller rival, Clinical Diagnostic Services. Her employment contract at that company had provided for a buyout if things did not work out. The new employer, however, was taken over by Quest, which made her an offer she did not consider viable.</p>
        <p>She would have been let go after a couple of months, she said, and had to sign a one-year noncompete agreement to collect benefits under a new buyout package that superseded the one in her contract. ''You can't vanish out of sight for a year and expect to resume,'' she said. ''I'm a working mother with three children to put through college.''</p>
        <p>She says she feels fortunate because she found another job and has a husband who is employed. Still, she says, she continues to negotiate with her former employer for benefits she says she deserves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neumark suggests asking a lawyer or financial adviser to evaluate any buyout package. A professional can provide guidance on questions like whether to take a lump sum or monthly payments, whether to continue certain benefits if you must pay for them, and how to handle any stock options you may hold.</p>
        <p>One low-cost source of advice is My Professional Advice in Baltimore (888 367-5252; www.myprofessionaladvice.com). The company contracts with lawyers, career counselors, accountants and other professionals to offer personal advice over the telephone at $34.95 a call. Legal documents, including buyout and severance agreements, can be reviewed for an additional $15 for up to five pages.</p>
        <p>The 2001 tax law gives employees new ''portability rules'' on retirement savings, said Craig Brimhall, vice president for wealth strategies at American Express Financial Advisors. The choices include leaving the money in the former employer's plan, rolling it over into an Individual Retirement Account (and from there possibly into a new employer's plan) and cashing it out, he said.</p>
        <p>For people planning to take early retirement, there is a useful quirk in the law: pension plans are allowed to make distributions to people as young as 55. But early retirees should remember that a 10 percent tax penalty is normally due on distributions from retirement plans before age 59 1/2. There is no penalty if the money is kept with the former employer's plan.</p>
        <p>Someone who plans to continue working might prefer to roll over pension money into an I.R.A., Mr. Brimhall said, because it offers greater control over investment decisions. This is particularly important for people whose employers' financial situations are shaky or who have a large portion of pension assets in company stock. To avoid 20 percent withholding, tax rollovers must be done by direct transfer from a plan's trustee to an I.R.A. custodian.</p>
        <p>''Once you make a decision, it is hard to reverse,'' Mr. Brimhall said.</p>
