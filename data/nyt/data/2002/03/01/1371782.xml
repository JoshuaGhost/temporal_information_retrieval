        <p>Sony will buy the shares of Aiwa that it does not already own and make the company a wholly owned subsidiary. Sony currently owns 61 percent of Aiwa, which makes low-end stereos and audiovisual equipment. With most of its production outside Japan, Aiwa's business boomed in the early 1990's, when the yen rose to record highs. In the years since, the company has fallen behind competitors who moved to China, where costs are cheaper.</p>
