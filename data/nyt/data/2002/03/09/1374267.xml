      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of Mar 7 article on Judge Charles W Pickering, federal appeals court nominee under fire for his early stands on civil rights, regarding reference to Sen Robert C Byrd's brief membership in Ku Klux Klan as young man</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Thursday about Charles W. Pickering, a federal appeals court nominee under fire for his early stands on civil rights, referred imprecisely to the stage of life in which Senator Robert C. Byrd had a Ku Klux Klan connection, apparently the topic of a veiled warning by the White House against using old personal history. Senator Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, joined the Klan in 1942, when he was 24 years old, no longer in his youth, and resigned the next year. He praised the Klan in a letter at age 28, a fact used against him in a 1952 campaign. Mr. Byrd has called his support of the Klan a mistake.</p>
