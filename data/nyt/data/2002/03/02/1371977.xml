        <p>Clyde Haberman NYC column scores Bloomberg administration for not saying who is in charge of New York City when mayor takes weekend jaunts; also, says time is right to address issue of mayoral succession in City Charter, which calls for public advocate to assume mayoralty if mayor is unable to function (M)</p>

        <p>A friend of Betsy Gotbaum, the public advocate, was startled to read the other day about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's penchant for flying helicopters. Not to walk on the dark side, but we all know that helicopters don't always behave. ''Oh my God,'' Ms. Gotbaum quoted her friend as saying, ''you might be mayor!''</p>
        <p>Now, let it be stated that nobody wishes Mr. Bloomberg harm, least of all Ms. Gotbaum.

        <p>A friend of Betsy Gotbaum, the public advocate, was startled to read the other day about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's penchant for flying helicopters. Not to walk on the dark side, but we all know that helicopters don't always behave. ''Oh my God,'' Ms. Gotbaum quoted her friend as saying, ''you might be mayor!''</p>
        <p>Now, let it be stated that nobody wishes Mr. Bloomberg harm, least of all Ms. Gotbaum. But the fact remains that should something ever happen to the high-flying mayor, it is she, as public advocate, who takes over at City Hall. It says so right there in the City Charter, our municipal constitution.</p>
        <p>Bet you can't name a dozen people who knew in November when they flipped the lever for public advocate that they were possibly choosing an accidental mayor. ''It's not in the forefront of people's minds that it's a succession vote that they're making,'' said Arthur J. Fried, executive director of the Center for Excellence in New York City Governance at New York University.</p>
        <p>All the same, the succession rules are such that New Yorkers could well wind up for a long stretch with someone in charge of City Hall who is poles apart from the person they voted for. The problem is that mayoral succession is one of those important but unsexy issues that keeps bouncing around with no one doing anything about it.</p>
        <p>It lacks the urgency of the budget deficit. It certainly lacks the fun of the new guessing game of Where's Mayor Mike This Weekend -- working in town, antiquing in Westchester, skiing in Vail, testing his 9-iron in Bermuda, eating bad English food in London? Mr. Bloomberg has homes in all those places. Tracking him down can be harder than figuring out Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.</p>
        <p>In his single-minded pursuit of preserving his privacy, the mayor insists that it is nobody's business where he goes on his days off.</p>
        <p>When he leaves town for a day or two, he apparently hands command to Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw. But it's a stealth assignment. City Hall refuses to say who in fact is minding the store. Is it Mr. Bloomberg? Mr. Shaw? How about John Zissel? He's the City Hall custodian, and has seen so many mayors come and go that he can probably do the job as well as any of them.</p>
        <p>The administration's theory behind this opaqueness is that merely acknowledging that the mayor has flown the coop would compromise his privacy beyond redemption. So his lieutenants have taken a vow of silence worthy of Trappist monks.</p>
        <p>Call us crazy, but is it too much to ask who's in charge? There's no need to divulge where exactly the mayor is. Just say who's in charge. You know, in case terrorists decide to take New York on again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's lieutenants say there is no problem: the mayor is in constant contact, and can fly home in no time on his private jet. Not if the airports are shut down, he can't. They were closed for days after Sept. 11. And if another huge crisis developed, even some of Mr. Bloomberg's admirers might start asking what he was doing sunning himself, unannounced, in Bermuda.</p>
        <p>THE recurring weekend mystery feeds into the more significant question of what to do if the office of mayor becomes vacant. As things stand, it is possible for the public advocate to take the reins and hold on for as long as 15 months. That, many agree, is too long, especially if the public advocate is not the mayor's political soul mate.</p>
        <p>The thing to do, they say, is change the charter. Ms. Gotbaum talks about a brief succession period, with a special mayoral election after a few months. Linda Stone Davidoff, executive director of the Citizens Union, agrees that ''the obvious answer is to shorten the time period.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg has also proposed speedy elections, but he wants the temporary caretaker at City Hall to be a deputy mayor who would be prohibited from running. Others talk about creating a new vice mayor -- an equivalent to the vice president -- who would be elected in tandem with the mayor and take charge if necessary.</p>
        <p>One problem is getting people to focus on this matter. It does not help that the former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gave charter revision a bad name. Again and again, he used it to enshrine his own achievements and to undermine enemies like Mark Green, the last public advocate.</p>
        <p>So change is probably not on the near horizon. It may be best, in the meantime, for editors to do their civic duty by opening a mayor-watching outpost in Bermuda. Consider this a job application. They say the rockfish is excellent at the Seahorse Grill.</p>
