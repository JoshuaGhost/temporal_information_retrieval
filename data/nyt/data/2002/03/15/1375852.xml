        <p>Training Day</p>
        <p>Not setting the best example, Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington, left) offers his new partner, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a joint laced with angel dust. Jake has been assigned to undercover duties, and Harris is supposed to show him the ropes. Instead Jake squirms under the thumb of a schemer who is more bully than adviser. But their conflict peters out in a glib potboiler. What makes the film is Mr. Washington's performance. ''His portrayal is a parody of movie-star misbehavior,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. ''Alonzo knows exactly how large he looms in the world and can puff himself up to blot out the sun.''</p>

        <p>2001. Warner. $22.98; DVD, $26.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 19.</p>
        <p>Riding in Cars With Boys</p>
        <p>The stream flows fast for Beverly Donofrio (Drew Barrymore), a 60's teenager in Wallingford, Conn. At 15 she has a baby and marries the father (Steve Zahn), a well-meaning but hapless addict named Ray. All of this gives no pleasure to her hidebound father (James Woods), nor is he pleased with her ambitions to become a writer. But everything goes wrong for Beverly, and she resigns herself to mothering her son, Jason (Cody Arens as a child and Adam Garcia as a young man). Soon it is 1986 and Jason is in college and the controlling Beverly is a journalist and again an aspiring author. For Ms. Barrymore the role is the clearest proof yet that she ''has what it takes to stretch her talents into large, complex portrayals'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2001. Columbia TriStar. $107.99; DVD, $27.96. 122 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: March 19.</p>
        <p>Heist</p>
        <p>A doughty old thief named Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) is forced into taking on an immensely complicated caper called ''the Swiss job.'' There's gold involved and the stuff is heavy. Bergman (Danny DeVito),  the fence and money-man, is treacherous, as is Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell), a young hood along on the job at Bergman's insistence. Silk has designs on Joe's young wife (Rebecca Pidgeon), who isn't disinterested. David Mamet is at work here as director and screenwriter, and with the always consummate Mr. Hackman paying attention to details ''what 'Heist' lacks in novelty it makes up for in solid entertainment'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2001. Warner. $19.96; DVD, $24.98. 107 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 19,</p>
        <p>The One</p>
        <p>The one is actually the many in a multiverse where a personable sheriff's deputy (Jet Li) in one place is a ruthless agent (also Mr. Li) bent on world domination in another. Anyway, an underwritten story dissipates as the two of them come together for a series of clashes that suggest ''an aerialist 'Singin' in the Rain' for the kickboxing set'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>2001. Columbia TriStar. $111.99; DVD, $27.96. 80 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette or DVD in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>DINNER WITH FRIENDS. Norman Jewison's filmed version of Donald Margulies's Pulitzer Prize-winning play was broadcast on HBO last August. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. Their best friends are two food writers (Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell) who have a strong enough marriage but regret that they possibly were not as gloriously happy as they might have been. Here are ''four fine actors working on more emotional layers than you can count,'' Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times. 2001. HBO. $94.99; DVD, $24.98. 94 minutes.</p>
        <p>ME AND ISAAC NEWTON. Michael Apted's documentary poses seven noted scientists for a glossy group portrait, and without going recklessly overboard implies that world-class minds are likely to be accompanied by an equally refined moral sense. Participants include the pharmaceutical chemist Gertrude Elion, the twinkling-eyed physicist Michio Kaku (shown gliding on an ice rink), the environmental physicist Ashok Gadgil and the primatologist Patricia Wright, whose work observing animals in the rain forest is the easiest to understand. Science may be fraught with cutthroat politics and clashing egos, but none of that messy stuff gets into a film, Stephen Holden wrote in The Times, that offers ''a largely comforting vision of collective genius balanced by compassion, humor and judicious self-assessment.'' 2000. First Look. $19.95; DVD, $29.95. 110 minutes. No rating.</p>
