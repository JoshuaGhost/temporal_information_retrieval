        <p>No white flags were raised. Nor were there any weeping cries of ''Uncle!'' Designers showing their fall 2002 collections here and in Europe were bound to take exception to the chants six months ago that fashion was frivolous or simply for the birds. That they voiced such clear-headed statements about women is surprising, though, after all the lollipop gestures and hip relevancy of the last few seasons. Maybe what designers needed was a moment on the ropes to see what was missing in fashion: great, womanly clothes. Here's a look at some of the trends for fall.</p>
        <p>Juliets and Jezebels</p>
        <p>AT the end of his superb show, Alexander McQueen sent out a lightly corseted black dress with a scoop neckline hinting of milkmaid innocence. This pretty effect, often combined with corset boning or ribbon lacing, turned out to be one of the more appealing themes in a strong, womanly season.</p>

        <p>No white flags were raised. Nor were there any weeping cries of ''Uncle!'' Designers showing their fall 2002 collections here and in Europe were bound to take exception to the chants six months ago that fashion was frivolous or simply for the birds. That they voiced such clear-headed statements about women is surprising, though, after all the lollipop gestures and hip relevancy of the last few seasons. Maybe what designers needed was a moment on the ropes to see what was missing in fashion: great, womanly clothes. Here's a look at some of the trends for fall.</p>
        <p>Juliets and Jezebels</p>
        <p>AT the end of his superb show, Alexander McQueen sent out a lightly corseted black dress with a scoop neckline hinting of milkmaid innocence. This pretty effect, often combined with corset boning or ribbon lacing, turned out to be one of the more appealing themes in a strong, womanly season.</p>
        <p>The style presents a lustier femininity than spring's folksy peasant tops, from which it clearly evolved; yet the look is almost as demure as something Lizzie Bennet would wear in ''Pride and Prejudice.''</p>
        <p>Similar dresses appeared at Prada and Lanvin, where they were sashed with ribbon and shown with ballet flats.</p>
        <p>Glamour From the Homely Art</p>
        <p>IF airlines didn't have a security issue with knitting needles, one could have imagined planes lifting out of Milan with editors counting stitches. Well, it's an inspired thought. There were so many ecstatic examples of knitwear, beginning in New York with mop-fringe sweaters by both Helmut Lang and Nicolas Ghesquiere, that by the time the shows ended, fashionistas were envisioning D.I.Y. granny scarves. The most expressive knits came from Missoni, with sweaters sloping off shoulders and swirling colors that recalled Venetian glass. At Gucci, sable tops were knitted with ribbon. Knitwear, more than embellishment, gave clothes a sense of unexpected finery and hand finish.</p>
        <p>But the most audacious statement was made in Paris by Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Gar√ßons. She treated knits like fabrics, using both flat circle patterns (for skirts) and more complicated cutting techniques to create body-wrapping jackets and dresses. The collection, which even included knitted flannels, demonstrated that nothing is ever a given in fashion.</p>
        <p>Quick, Pants or Skirt?</p>
        <p>A YEAR ago, pants clung tenaciously to the hips -- not everybody's finest point. But now, with the fashion focus shifting to the waist, pants return to more ecumenical proportions, creating the illusion of vixen height. Who can mind that?</p>
        <p>Those low-riding boy styles still turn up -- at Dolce &amp; Gabbana, in washed corduroy -- but they don't jibe with the current mood of high female polish. Balenciaga's high-waisted black pants looked as sharp as exclamation points, but other designers were on the same page: Ralph Lauren with his morning-stripe trousers, and Alexander McQueen, whose slim wool pantsuits have small leather buckles at the sides to connect the jacket to the trousers for a more taut line. Beribboned knickers appeared at Yves Saint Laurent, and there were a few awkward attempts (at Giorgio Armani) to float harem pants. But edge still matters, and one collection that had it was Lagerfeld Gallery, with tight jeans tucked into black lace-up stiletto boots.</p>
        <p>Up until now, skirts have seemed out of favor, or at least underplayed, in most collections. But for fall, it's almost an even split between skirts and pants. Marc Jacobs showed a lot of skirts, hemmed just around the knee, with the new twin set: a fine-gauged cardigan shrugged over a rumpled washed-silk top. At Miu Miu and Chanel, there were minis, and at Calvin Klein, box-pleated skirts, worn with simple pullovers, that fell below the knee. Jean Paul Gaultier proposed a kind of do-it-yourself skirt: a loose, barrel-shaped number that you hitch up over your shoulder or around your waist with a belt. Deny it if you wish, but it's a look.</p>
        <p>Warmth, Supersized</p>
        <p>UNLESS you're wearing Miuccia Prada's peekaboo raincoat, you can go naked under next season's big coats, and nobody will know. Coats make a standout statement for fall. At Chanel and Gucci, they're like big cocoons, engulfing the body. Martin Margiela started the jumbo look, with sleeves that overshoot the wrists, but the difference now is the dressy, dolled-up finish; the Gucci coats have slick panels of satin along the edges.</p>
        <p>Where there is amplitude, there is also exaggeration -- in the supersized collars of Balenciaga's fitted black leather jackets, in the blossomy fur sleeves of a Prada jacket, in the grommet butterflies alighting on a brown suede Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat. The lines are classic, but one detail is blown up.</p>
        <p>Coats convey an Asian influence, too. There are the more obvious kimono styles at Gucci and Bally, with wide sleeves and obi-wrapped waists; but at Dior, where coats and jackets eccentrically spilled away at the shoulders, John Galliano based his cuts on tribal styles from Central Asia. Inevitably, with Hollywood simplification, Marc Jacobs's lovely fur-trimmed coats for Louis Vuitton will conjure up chilly ''Nanook of the North'' scenes. But they're just a good example of a single garment speaking volumes.</p>
        <p>Just Fashion, Please</p>
        <p>HEARING retailers complain after the Milan shows about the lack of creative sparkle made you wonder if they realized what they had before their eyes. It's a rare season when you see clothes -- at Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Gaultier or McQueen -- that clearly impart substance and sophistication to the customer while satisfying the fashion objectives of magazines. All too often you sense a divide between what editors like and what women will actually wear.</p>
        <p>But this time designers have closed the gap, by concentrating on clothes that have conspicuous design value and individuality. There was nothing in Jean Paul Gaultier's collection, for instance, that wasn't wearable, but the impression it left was pure fashion. Those displaced slips at Martin Margiela were even more assertive. They seemed to say: ''This is fashion. Now deal with it.''</p>
        <p>Maybe the trouble with appreciating fashion these days is that people in the industry -- journalists, buyers -- are used to conceptual gimmicks and package deals. They're looking for quick-fix fashion -- Bohemians, New Romantics. And for once designers did not oblige them.</p>
