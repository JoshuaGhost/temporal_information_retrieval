        <p>A man was shot in the stomach on a subway train last night, the police said. The man, 25, was on the southbound A train between the Ralph Avenue and Rockaway Avenue stops at 7:47 p.m. when another man, in his 20's, shot him once, said Officer George Jensen, a police spokesman. The victim was in stable condition at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. In a separate incident around the same time, a 21-year-old man was stabbed in the leg on the platform at the Lorimer Street Station on the L train, Officer Jensen said. The police said they had no suspects in either incident.</p>
