        <p>Sexy Beast</p>
        <p>A beefy middle-aged English safecracker named Gal (Ray Winstone) is basking in what he supposes is retirement at his villa in Spain when he is visited by Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, left), an emissary from Gal's old gang. Logan wants Gal's participation in another big job. A vicious psychotic palpitating with fury, he isn't the kind of man to whom one easily says no. He also has problems with Gal's cushy setup in Spain, Gal's wife (Amanda Redman) and the couple's housemates (Cavan Kendall and Julianne White). It all makes an unpleasant time at the villa, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, as the director, Jonathan Glazer, ''lets his story build slowly, with the haunting indirection of a Pinter play.''</p>
        <p>2001. Fox. $107.99; DVD, $29.98. 91 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 12.</p>

        <p>Zoolander</p>
        <p>In Ben Stiller's sendup of politics and pop culture, the crazed clothier Mugatu (Will Ferrell) chooses the very dumb male model Derek Zoolander (Mr. Stiller) to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Zoolander is to be programmed Ã  la ''Manchurian Candidate'' and do the job as he prances the runway at a big fashion show. But Derek has just been unseated as the world's best male model and may be too addled to respond. In fact, Zoolander seems interested only in getting back to his roots in the New Jersey coal mines and teaching children how to read. ''The fun comes from how seamlessly Mr. Stiller blends everything together'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2001. Paramount. $106.99; DVD, $29.99. 89 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: March 12.</p>
        <p>Joy Ride</p>
        <p>When Venna (Leelee Sobieski) meets up with her high school friend (Paul Walker) and his brother (Steve Zahn) for a drive across the country, she is unaware that the pair is being stalked by a maniacal trucker uspet at a CB prank they played on him. And she remains unaware until the trucker calls their motel room in the wilds of Nebraska to say he's hot on their trail. While John Dahl's film doesn't quite rise to the level of his ''Red Rock West'' or ''Last Seduction,'' it is ''much more effectively terrifying than the usual overplotted, underwritten Hollywood thriller'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>2001. Fox. $110.99; DVD, $27.98. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: March 12.</p>
