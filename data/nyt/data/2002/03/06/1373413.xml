        <p>When someone gives to the Twin Towers Fund -- even a contribution with lots of zeroes -- ''I usually buy the coffee at the donation ceremony,'' said LAURENCE A. LEVY, the fund's president. But on Monday, the someone making the donation was  ALAIN DUCASSE. So the event was at his restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan, with truffled herbed ravioli and loin of veal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy accepted a check for $150,000 from Mr. Ducasse and FRANÇOIS DELAHAYE, general manager of the Hotel Plaza Athénée in Paris, who raised money for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks at an auction in Paris. Checks also went to City Harvest ($50,000) and City Meals on Wheels ($25,000). The surprise last-minute guests? RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI and his friend JUDITH NATHAN. They greeted the other guests (including 50 relatives of police, fire and rescue workers who died on Sept. 11) before meeting their raspberry-accented, chocolate-biscuit-mousse-cake desserts. But some things never change. Mr. Levy had to have coffee, and this time, like the meal, it was on Mr. Ducasse.</p>
