        <p>In what the defense called ''a bittersweet victory,'' a judge followed a jury's recommendation today and sentenced a onetime British millionaire to life in prison for double murder, taking him off Florida's death row after 16 years.</p>
        <p>The inmate, Krishna Maharaj, 63, was originally sentenced to die in the electric chair in the killings of an estranged business associate, Derrick Moo Young and his son, Duane, in the penthouse of a Miami hotel in 1986. The case became a cause célèbre in Britain, which has no death penalty.</p>
        <p>A Florida court upheld his murder conviction but overturned his death sentence four years ago, largely because of irregularities involving his trial judge.</p>
        <p>At a resentencing hearing on Monday, a member of the British parliament, Peter Bottomley; and a former professional wrestler, Mick McManus, offered glowing testimony by satellite about the character of Mr. Maharaj, a Trinidad native who imported food from the West Indies to Britain and owned a stable of thoroughbred horses.</p>
        <p>Though defense lawyers said they were relieved that Judge Jerald Bagley of Miami-Dade Circuit Court spared Mr. Maharaj's life, they continued to proclaim his innocence.</p>
        <p>''Where we go from here is straight into federal court to challenge his conviction,'' said Clive Stafford-Smith, one of the lawyers.</p>
        <p>The state's case against Mr. Maharaj was built around a witness whom the defense asserts it can now discredit.</p>
        <p>''We've uncovered so many new pieces of evidence,'' said Benedict Kuehne, co-counsel for Mr. Maharaj. ''That is what we are going to try to demonstrate to the federal court.''</p>
