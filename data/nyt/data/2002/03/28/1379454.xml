        <p>Two correction officers from Northern State Prison here were suspended today without pay in administrative hearings that stemmed from their arrests during a raid at a strip club that the Newark police said was used for prostitution. The raid has also become an issue in the contentious race for mayor.</p>
        <p>Investigators are still trying to identify police officers from departments in the region who they believed were photographed for membership at the club, where the two prison guards and 29 other people were arrested last weekend on charges related to prostitution. Two Newark officers believed to be members of the club are under investigation but have not been charged, the police said.</p>
        <p>The Newark police raided the club, Sights, at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, after a monthlong undercover investigation prompted by a tip that sex was for sale there, said Sgt. Robert Koval, a department spokesman. Among those arrested were 15 women on prostitution charges, including a 16-year-old who had been reported missing in Jackson Township two years ago, he said.</p>
        <p>The two correction officers and the club's owner, Moses Wilson Jr., were charged with promoting prostitution and promoting underage prostitution, which carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.</p>
        <p>The correction officers, Mark Jones and David Jones, who are also charged with official misconduct, were suspended without pay following administrative hearings for both men today, said Chris Carden, a spokesman for the State Department of Corrections.</p>
        <p>Officers from other departments may also face disciplinary action and even criminal prosecution, police officials said.</p>
        <p>To join the club, Sergeant Koval said, customers agreed to have their pictures taken with a Polaroid camera. During the raid investigators seized more than 200 Polaroids, he said, many with the names of departments in New York and New Jersey -- but not the men's names -- written on the back. He said Newark had contacted the departments, which he declined to identify, but said none had confirmed whether the men in the photographs were officers. The New York Police Department and the New Jersey State Police confirmed they had received photographs and were reviewing them.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Koval said the two Newark officers had not been charged with a crime, but they had been reassigned to administrative posts, and they could face criminal or disciplinary charges.</p>
        <p>On its marquee, Sights is described as a ''private, exclusive nightclub.'' The club featured a juice bar and nude dancers who would have sex with customers in private cubicles, the sergeant said, typically at rates of $100 for 10 minutes. He said live sex acts were also performed. He added that Sights did not have a license to operate as a juice bar, strip club or any other kind of business, and said the club would remain closed.</p>
        <p>The club owner's number is unpublished, and repeated messages left on the club's answering machine and with its lawyer, Alfonso Robinson III, were not returned.</p>
        <p>The matter has also made its way into the race between Mayor Sharpe James and Councilman Cory Booker. A news release from the Newark Police on Sunday said that one of the 200 or so men in line outside the club Sunday was an aide to Mr. Booker.</p>
        <p>The aide, Jermaine James -- no relation to the mayor -- was not charged with a crime, but the release noted that the acting police director, Anthony F. Ambrose, asked the city business administrator, Harold Lucas, to review the aide's conduct. Mr. Ambrose and Mr. Lucas are both appointees of the mayor, and the Booker campaign questioned whether mention of Councilman Booker's name in the release was intended to embarrass him in advance of the May election.</p>
        <p>''Their motives are a little suspect,'' said Jen Bluestein, Mr. Booker's campaign spokeswoman. She added that the aide was ''in the wrong place at the wrong time'' but said his personal behavior was not related to his official duties.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Koval and the mayor's office denied there was any attempt to embarrass Mr. Booker.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I could care less who wins,'' Sergeant Koval said of the election. ''But the facts are the facts: the man was in line when he was confronted by police. How do we know that Mr. James is going to be in line at that particular time? Did we put him there?''</p>
