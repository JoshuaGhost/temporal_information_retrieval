        <p>Just as the all-in-one computer helped alleviate the frustrations of home users trying to get their technology up and running with a minimum of Advil, home theater systems are becoming simpler to set up.</p>
        <p>The new RTDVD1 Home Theater System from RCA combines a DVD player that can also handle audio CD and MP3 playback with a Dolby Digital decoder and an AM-FM radio tuner in one thin silver-colored box.</p>
        <p>The single-disc player can program up to 32 tracks and play back both CD-R and CD-RW discs, and the radio's digital tuner can preset 30 stations.</p>
        <p>To really let the neighbors know you are home, the RTDVD1 system also comes with five small 32-watt satellite speakers and a 40-watt subwoofer to provide the surround-sound mix common to most DVD movies.</p>
        <p>Although dealing with one component and six speakers may unnerve neophytes, the system comes with a ''quick connect'' guide and color-coded wires.</p>
        <p>The RTDVD1 system has a suggested retail price of $399 and is available at major electronics stores as well as at www  .rca.com.</p>
