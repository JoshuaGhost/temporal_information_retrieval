        <p>The Cantrell &amp; Cochrane Group, an Irish food and beverage maker known for potato chips and soda, canceled its initial public offering on the Dublin and London exchanges just 48 hours before the new stock was scheduled to begin trading. The company cited market volatility as the reason for withdrawing the offer, which would have been the first on the Dublin market since 1999; the benchmark ISEQ index has fallen 21 percent since January. Cantrell &amp; Cochrane had planned to sell 48 percent of its equity at a price of 2.60 to 3.60 euros a share, raising at least 923 million euros ($899.94 million) to help pay down 800 million euros of debt. The company can still meet its business agenda and pay for acquisitions without the share offering, the chairman, Anthony O'Brien, said. The group has exclusive Irish distribution rights for Pepsi and 7-Up, and owns Tayto potato chips.</p>
