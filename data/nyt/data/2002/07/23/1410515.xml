        <p>A 16-year-old girl pleaded guilty yesterday to smothering her 8-month-old daughter last January, the Camden County prosecutor's office said yesterday. The girl, Stephanie Fitzgerald, of Pennsauken, will be sentenced to 12 years and will become eligible for parole in about 10 years. She faced 30 years if her case had gone to trial. Ms. Fitzgerald told Judge Linda G. Baxter of Superior Court that she held her hand over the mouth of her baby, Isabella Steele, for one minute, then waited 10 minutes to call for help. The baby died four days later. Prosecutors are to release further details of the case later.</p>
