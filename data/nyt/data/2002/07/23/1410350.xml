        <p>Americans are wearier after their vacations than before them, a Gallup poll has found.</p>
        <p>The survey found that fewer than a third of Americans took breaks lasting longer than nine days.</p>
        <p>About a third of working adults said they had to put in more hours in the office the week before their vacation, contributing to the finding that 46 percent of those surveyed felt tired before their vacation began. But 54 percent described themselves as tired on returning home, the telephone survey of 1,000 adults in May found.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roger J. Cadieux, a professor of psychiatry at Penn State who helped analyze the data, said good planning could help. If the main goal is recharging batteries, he said, ''I'm not going to go to Disney World; I'm going to go to a house in the mountains, a place with a lot of books.''</p>
        <p>His other suggestions:</p>
        <p>*If you have insomnia, see a doctor before the trip. ''Otherwise,'' he said, ''you're just packing that insomnia with you.''</p>
        <p>*Avoid a blitz of work to clear your desk before you leave (or when you return).</p>
        <p>*Do not put off packing until the last minute.</p>
        <p>*Bring some items from your bedroom, like a pillow or a clock.</p>
        <p>*Don't take work with you -- or let it find you. ''Some people get FedExed every day.''</p>
        <p>*Don't do everything in one day that you should do in two.</p>
