        <p>Word for Word column excerpts Ayn Rand's work and 1963 Alan Greenspan essay, to make point that neither high priestess of unfettered capitalism nor powerful Fed chairman, her longtime friend and colleague, seemed to envision unethical behavior of some of today's captains of industry; photos (M)</p>

        <p>IN 1996, he questioned the ''irrational exuberance'' of the American investor. Last Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, brought that era to a definitive end with his diagnosis that ''an infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community.'' Acknowledging he was wrong in his long-held belief that the government should not regulate the accounting industry, Mr. Greenspan also said: ''It is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. It is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan's embrace of greater regulation is a remarkable turnaround for an economist who for many years was a close friend and colleague of Ayn Rand, the high priestess of unfettered capitalism, who fulminated against the ideas Mr. Greenspan now espouses. In the early 1950's, while in his 20's, Mr. Greenspan was a member of Rand's inner circle (they called themselves the Collective), and was among those who read her influential 1957 novel, ''Atlas Shrugged,'' in manuscript. It was written, Rand once said, ''to glorify the real kind of productive, free-enterprise businessman in a way he has never been glorified before.'' But, she added, ''I make mincemeat out of the kind of businessman . . . that runs to government for assistance, subsidies, legislation and regulation.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Greenspan's embrace of greater regulation is a remarkable turnaround for an economist who for many years was a close friend and colleague of Ayn Rand, the high priestess of unfettered capitalism, who fulminated against the ideas Mr. Greenspan now espouses. In the early 1950's, while in his 20's, Mr. Greenspan was a member of Rand's inner circle (they called themselves the Collective), and was among those who read her influential 1957 novel, ''Atlas Shrugged,'' in manuscript.

But, she added, ''I make mincemeat out of the kind of businessman . . . that runs to government for assistance, subsidies, legislation and regulation.''</p>
        <p>Forty-five years after the publication of her magnum opus, which Rand herself compared to the Bible, greed apparently represents a greater danger to capitalism than government bureaucrats. But back then neither Mr. Greenspan nor Rand seemed to have envisioned the unethical behavior of some of today's captains of industry. Excerpts follow from Rand's work and from a 1963 essay written by Mr. Greenspan for The Objectivist Newsletter, which was devoted to Rand's philosophy.</p>
        <p>BILL GOLDSTEIN</p>
        <p>In Mr. Greenspan's essay, titled ''The Assault on Integrity,'' he wrote at length about the functioning of a healthy free-enterprise system and the perils of regulation. (Years later, however, in a profile in The New Yorker, a colleague recounted his warning ''to distinguish carefully between what he believes personally and how he acts as chairman of the Fed.'')</p>
        <p>Protection of the consumer against ''dishonest and so-called unscrupulous business practices'' has become a cardinal ingredient of welfare statism. Left to their own devices, it is alleged, businessmen would attempt to sell unsafe food and drugs, fraudulent securities, and shoddy buildings. Thus, it is argued, the Pure Food and Drug Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the numerous building regulatory agencies are indispensable if the consumer is to be protected from the ''greed'' of the businessman.</p>
        <p>But it is precisely the ''greed'' of the businessman or, more appropriately, his profit-seeking, which is the unexcelled protector of the consumer. . . .</p>
        <p>What collectivists refuse to recognize is that it is in the self-interest of every businessman to have a reputation for honest dealings and a quality product. . . . Thus the incentive to scrupulous performance operates on all levels of a given field of production. It is a built-in safeguard of a free enterprise system and the only real protection of consumers against business dishonesty.</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Greenspan wrote, a greater threat to a free-market economy with no barriers to ambition or achievement was posed by the government.</p>
        <p>Government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the consumer. It does not build quality into goods, or accuracy into information. Its sole ''contribution'' is to substitute force and fear for incentive as the ''protector'' of the consumer. The euphemism of government press releases to the contrary notwithstanding, the basis of regulation is armed force. At the bottom of the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun. . . .</p>
        <p>Protective legislation falls into the category of preventive law. Businessmen are being subjected to governmental coercion prior to the commission of any crime. In a free economy, the government may step in only when a fraud has been perpetrated, or a demonstrable damage has been done to a consumer; in such cases the only protection required is that of criminal law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan's essay was reprinted in 1966 in ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' together with Rand's operatic articulation of some of her views, titled ''America's Persecuted Minority: Big Business'':</p>
        <p>If a small group of men were always regarded as guilty, in any clash with any other group, regardless of the issues or circumstances involved, would you call it persecution? If this group were always made to pay for the sins, errors, or failures of any other group, would you call that persecution? If this group had to live under a silent reign of terror, under special laws, from which all other people were immune, laws which the accused could not grasp or define in advance and which the accuser could interpret in any way he pleased -- would you call that persecution? If this group were penalized, not for its faults, but for its virtues, not for its incompetence, but for its ability, not for its failures, but for its achievements, and the greater the achievement, the greater the penalty -- would you call that persecution?</p>
        <p>If your answer is ''yes'' -- then ask yourself what sort of monstrous injustice you are condoning, supporting, or perpetuating. That group is the American businessman. . . .</p>
        <p>Every movement that seeks to enslave a country, every dictatorship or potential dictatorship, needs some minority group as a scapegoat which it can blame for the nation's troubles and use as a justification of its own demands for dictatorial powers. In Soviet Russia, the scapegoat was the bourgeoisie; in Nazi Germany, it was the Jewish people; in America, it is the businessman.</p>
        <p>The hero of ''Atlas Shrugged,'' John Galt, maintained that executives who commit fraud betray their own highest values:</p>
        <p>Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud -- that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of raising your victim to a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn of their blindness, a slave of their nonthinking and their evasions, while their intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and flee.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Greenspan argued in 1963 that moral values ''are the motive power of capitalism'':</p>
        <p>Capitalism is based on self-interest and self-esteem; it holds integrity and trustworthiness as cardinal virtues and makes them pay off in the marketplace, thus demanding that men survive by means of virtues, not of vices. It is this superlatively moral system that the welfare statists propose to improve upon by means of preventative law, snooping bureaucrats, and the chronic goad of fear.</p>
        <p>Rand, of course, also had plenty to say about virtue and integrity, as in this 1944 letter to a friend who asked for advice on how to meet ''a worthwhile woman'':</p>
        <p>One finds worthwhile men and women among people who work. Follow me here very carefully, forgetting the cheap generalities which all our modern minds have been stuffed with. I do not mean LABOR. I do not mean people who have to earn their living. I do not mean proletarians. . . . I mean what you and I understand by the term ''competent people.'' People who love to work, who are good at it, serious about it and concerned primarily with it. Bright, creative, productive, ambitious people. People who get money for their work, but who do not work primarily for the money -- whether it's a weekly pay envelope or a thousand dollar bonus. People who are ambitious -- not to climb socially, not to get wealth and titles -- but ambitious to do more and more work of a better and better kind. . . .</p>
        <p>In a general way, that is the advice I'd give you: look for places where sincere people are working hard -- and go there. Choose by the nature of the work. Going incognito into a convention of ditch diggers would do you as little good as going to the swankiest Wall Street party.</p>
