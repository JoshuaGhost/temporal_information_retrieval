        <p>For years, this agricultural community 60 miles from Denver was defined by the sprawling meatpacking plant at its northern edge, Weld County's largest employer, looming large by its considerable size and unmistakable odor. At any given time, up to 200,000 cattle stood in nearby pens, awaiting their fate on the killing floors inside.</p>
        <p>More recently, the plant's prominence has faded a bit as Greeley has diversified and grown. Several big companies, including Allstate Insurance and Kodak, have opened large offices here, and new subdivisions are turning the west side of town into sprawling suburbia. Even the smell has abated to a degree. The primary holding pens have been moved well out of town, and only on the windiest days are people who live here chased inside, windows closed.</p>
        <p>But now, a different odor is wafting about, the scent of trouble. It follows reports that E. coli bacteria from animals processed here sickened 19 people in six states. Prompted by the Agriculture Department, the plant owner, the ConAgra Beef Company, recalled 354,200 pounds of beef on June 30 and an additional 18.7 million pounds on Friday. The meat was recalled ''as a cautionary measure,'' said Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman.</p>
        <p>So far, no illnesses have been reported from beef in the second recall, but the total amount of beef involved amounts to the second-largest meat recall in history, behind Hudson Foods' 25 million pounds in 1997 -- and a scary one, for the presumed cause. The pathogen, E. coli 0157:H7, contaminates meat by contact with an animal's intestines or fecal material and can cause a variety of illnesses and even death.</p>
        <p>''Bottom line, this will stigmatize the plant,'' said Ron Bush, president of Local 990 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which has 2,400 members working in the plant. ''But it remains to be seen what the long-term effect will be.''</p>
        <p>Greeley has always had ambivalent feelings about its meatpacking plant, which a local family, the Monforts, opened in 1960 and sold to ConAgra in 1987. Employing more than 3,000 people -- including 600 management personnel who work in a new building on Greeley's west side -- ConAgra acts as a major economic engine for the city and county, processing thousands of pounds of beef a day and selling products that millions of consumers buy.</p>
        <p>A 1999 study by Colorado State University found that ConAgra generated $2.5 billion in annual economic benefits for Weld County.</p>
        <p>''It has helped the city grow,'' said Leonard Wiest, the city manager of Greeley, whose population has grown 45 percent over the last two decades, to 76,930 in 2000 from 53,006 in 1980.</p>
        <p>''This year, we will grant anywhere from 900 to 1,000 new building permits,'' Mr. Wiest said. ''Those are record numbers.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, periodic labor unrest at the plant, injuries, safety-code violations and the slaughterhouse smell have always added a ''yeah, but'' to any local discussion of the plant's civic contributions. Now there is much more to worry about.</p>
        <p>Long before the recalls, ConAgra announced that it was selling a majority interest in its fresh beef and pork processing operations to Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, an investment group based in Dallas, for a price announced in May as $1.4 billion. The deal, which includes the Greeley plant, one of six ConAgra owns, is expected to close in a few weeks.</p>
        <p>ConAgra officials are promising that nothing will change at ground level here other than the name, to Swift &amp; Company. But as epilogue to the sale, a series of problems -- the huge recall, fears that more consumers might fall ill and ConAgra's unstable stock price -- are raising questions over what the future holds for the plant and for Greeley.</p>
        <p>For now, it may be too soon to tell. Mayor Jerry Wones predicted ''a short-term nightmare'' for the company but minimal impact, if any, on the city. ''People don't associate the two,'' Mr. Wones said of bad beef and Greeley. ''When you recall cars, people don't start blasting Detroit. I imagine the whole industry will come under some scrutiny, but not the town or the state of Colorado.''</p>
        <p>Kay Norton, president of the University of Northern Colorado, who was legal counsel for ConAgra for 16 years through 1998, said the recall could affect the company financially if it loses several big customers. ''But that takes a while to demonstrate,'' Ms. Norton said, expressing doubt that much would come of it.</p>
        <p>Plant workers say they are not sure what to make of things. So many animals come in; so much meat goes out. Federal inspectors are working inside the plant every day. ''I assume they're watching,'' said Mr. Bush, the union president, who holds the inspectors more accountable than ConAgra for the E. coli outbreak. ''That's why they're there, right?''</p>
        <p>Yet things happen, and now the authorities are trying to figure out why. Joe Antuna, who has worked at the plant for 35 years, first as a cutter and now as a water treatment specialist, said layoffs or other changes ''could hurt the plant, but it might help, too, you know, slow things down for a short time, clean things up. I think that would be a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Jesse Barboza, 31, a meat cutter from Texas who has worked at the plant for 10 years, said he has always taken pride in his job, which made it possible for him to own a home and raise four children.</p>
        <p>''You make it there that long, it has to be worth something,'' Mr. Barboza said. ''Yeah, the pride, it's kind of there. But not the way it was in the past.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that in general, union workers were happy in the plant. He credited the management with sincere efforts to help Latino workers, who make up 90 percent of the plant employees, by improving working conditions and setting up programs like English classes. Much of the satisfaction flows from a four-year labor agreement signed two years ago that gave workers a 14 percent raise and new benefits.</p>
        <p>That meant a lot to Mr. Barboza, who said it was less common now for supervisors to mistreat workers. He recalled a supervisor denying his request to visit a restroom, saying, ''You already went today.'' That does not happen much anymore.</p>
        <p>Mario Hernandez, a spokesman for the Mexican consulate in Denver, said his office had received no complaints in recent years about conditions in the plant.</p>
        <p>Still, there are problems, Mr. Bush said. Despite more workers staying at the plant longer -- now an average of 18 months, an improvement over recent years, when low pay and poor conditions drove many people out after a week or two -- the company cannot find enough workers.</p>
        <p>''They hire, on average, 30 to 50 a week, and they're lucky to keep half of them,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Why? That's the $64,000 question. If I knew the answer, I'd be a well-paid consultant.''</p>
        <p>Supervisors still speak abusively to workers, Mr. Bush said. ''But now,'' he said, ''the company will act against them more quickly.''</p>
        <p>Around town, ConAgra's profile seems less pronounced than it was decades ago. Many people just shrugged when asked about the recalls, saying the plant had withstood other problems, like the 1980 strike that shut it down for 73 days and led the Monforts to close it for two years.</p>
        <p>''You hear about things like that,'' Austin Debrito, a supervisor at Pete's Old Town Diner and a marketing major at the university, said of the recall. ''But it's mad cow disease from this beef, E. coli from that beef. I haven't heard one question about beef since it happened, and we're serving quite a few T-bones.''</p>
