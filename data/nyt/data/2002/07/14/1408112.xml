        <p>YOU can drink a mojito without really thinking about it, and that's a pretty good recommendation for a summer cocktail.</p>
        <p>Then the music starts -- the sad, swaying strum that seems to be coming out of a decaying Cuban guitar being played by a decaying Cuban guitar player with a soft voice and a gold tooth. But it's coming out of you. That's something to think about.</p>

        <p>YOU can drink a mojito without really thinking about it, and that's a pretty good recommendation for a summer cocktail.</p>
        <p>Then the music starts -- the sad, swaying strum that seems to be coming out of a decaying Cuban guitar being played by a decaying Cuban guitar player with a soft voice and a gold tooth. But it's coming out of you. That's something to think about.</p>
        <p>Succeeding the daiquiri and the Cuba Libre, this year's round of arcaded Latin nostalgia is being distilled quickly in the mojito, with its gentle memory of rum, lime and mint. People at bars, including Cuban-themed restaurants like Asia de Cuba and Cuba Cafe in New York, are ordering them left and right. And liquor companies, seizing the mojito's moment, have introduced mojito-flavored rums like Mojito Club and Martí Auténtico: in effect, the ''Buena Vista Social Club'' in a bottle.</p>
        <p>The mojito is also being knocked off and reinvented -- the sincerest form of flattery. Douglas Rodríguez, the Latino celebrity chef, serves a mojito martini at Chicama in New York -- a two-fisted attempt to grab two trends at once. Mary's Off Jane, a New York cafe, bakes mojito cookies.</p>
        <p>''We developed a mojito product to tap into the trend,'' said Angelo Vassallo, a vice president at Pernod Ricard USA, which introduced Mojito Club last month. ''Clubs, prestige accounts were making their own mojitos. We saw it as an opportunity to come up with a new flavor system, the next adopted by Americans -- an alternative to the margarita, which is the No. 1 cocktail in the country.''</p>
        <p>The mojito originated in Cuba as a farmers' drink in the late 19th century as Cuba's rum industry modernized, making the mojito as common as beer. Only the rich drank it with ice and soda. The mojito's popularity in the United States coincides with an increased interest in Cuban-style rums. Cuban rums are unavailable.</p>
        <p>Joseph Magliocco, president of Chatham Imports, which developed Martí Auténtico, worked with two rum makers in the Dominican Republic to create his basic rum recipe, which emphasizes the notes of flower, fruit and nut that are typical of Cuban rums.</p>
        <p>Yerba buena, or Cuban mint, specified in recipes as the mojito's native mint, is peppermint, though the classification is also loosely applied in Cuba to bergamot and the rugose form of spearmint, according to Dr. Art Tucker in the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources at Delaware State University. Dr. Tucker is an expert on mint.</p>
        <p>''The latter, 'M. Spicata,' is very interesting and is found wherever the Spanish went, from Lake Atitlon in Guatemala to New Mexico to the Philippines,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ah, there's that music again.</p>
        <p>MOJITO  From Cuba Cafe</p>
        <p>1 ounce mint leaves, torn in half  2 ounces fresh lime juice  1 1/2 ounces white rum  1 teaspoon extra-fine granulated sugar  Crushed ice  4 ounces club soda.</p>
        <p>1. Muddle (crush with a pestle) the mint with the lime juice in the bottom of a tall cocktail glass.</p>
        <p>2. Add the rum, sugar, crushed ice and soda. Cover and shake, and uncover, serving with a lime wedge.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 serving.</p>
