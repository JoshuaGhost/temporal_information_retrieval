        <p>At 68, the Democrat is making her first run for public office. The Republican, 45, is a political prodigy. He has been on the ballot in every major election since 1984, serving in Congress and the Missouri Legislature.</p>
        <p>She supports abortion rights and gun control, and is the darling of Emily's List, a Democratic women's fund-raising group. He is beloved by the National Rife Association and the president, who has swooped into Missouri twice, raising $2 million for the campaign.</p>
        <p>Their battle to represent this tossup state in the Senate promises to be among this fall's closest and costliest, one of a handful of races considered crucial to the balance of power in the upper house of Congress.</p>
        <p>As the two candidates compete for the center, there is also a twist. The novice, Jean Carnahan, the Democrat, is the incumbent, and the veteran politician, Jim Talent, is the Republican challenger.</p>
        <p>''There are things that happen in your life that really determine the rest of your life,'' Mrs. Carnahan said recently, referring to the plane crash that killed her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, and their son three weeks before the 2000 election. ''I feel like I'm doing what he would want me to do.''</p>
        <p>Less than two years after being appointed to the Senate seat her husband won posthumously by defeating the incumbent, John Ashcroft, Senator Carnahan is struggling to create an independent political identity after 46 years of riding shotgun as a political wife.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent, who fell 20,000 votes shy of becoming governor in 2000, is fighting an opponent who has widespread sympathy and a record so short it leaves little to criticize. The young father of three talks often of energy and experience, how he could spend decades in Washington if elected. ''The election is about what we ought to do in the future, not about the past,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though the campaign is still mostly invisible to Missouri voters, it has already captured much national money and celebrity, though television advertisements will not begin until later this month, closer to the pro forma Aug. 6 primaries. Tipper Gore is campaigning for Mrs. Carnahan this weekend; President Bush and former President George Bush lead the roster of Republican stars who have stumped the state for Mr. Talent.</p>
        <p>Missouri is an important test in these off-year elections. About 40 percent of the electorate is committed to each party, with 20 percent undecided.</p>
        <p>So far, rather than emphasize their polar stances on issues like abortion and gun control, the candidates have talked mostly about health care, prescription drugs and domestic defense. Analysts here say negative campaigning is unlikely because of the tragedy that thrust Mrs. Carnahan into politics.</p>
        <p>The latest poll, by KOMU-TV in Columbia, Mo., gives Mrs. Carnahan an eight-point edge, with 12 percent undecided (and a four-point margin of error), but Mr. Talent said his trackers showed him up four points.</p>
        <p>''Her job is maintaining the momentum, and his job is to come back,'' said James W. Davis, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent has raised $1.8 million in the last three months, bringing his total since August 2001 to almost $5 million; Mrs. Carnahan's campaign declined to release its latest fund-raising numbers before the deadline for reporting them, on Monday.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect the election to be decided by St. Louis County, where growing suburbs, once Republican, have shifted toward the Democrats. A few prominent African-Americans, angry at the Democratic establishment over redistricting in St. Louis, have threatened to support Mr. Talent, who is from the area. (Mrs. Carnahan has been living mainly out of a suitcase since her farmhouse in Rolla, 106 miles southwest of St. Louis, burned after lightning struck it last year.)</p>
        <p>But William R. Lowry, another Washington University professor, said he did not expect much crossover voting. ''I think it will be more like who gets their constituencies out to the polls,'' Dr. Lowry said.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have essentially spent three years on the trail; only the bumper stickers have been edited, with ''Jean'' instead of ''Mel'' Carnahan, and ''Senate'' replacing ''Governor'' under ''Talent,'' with a trademark star in the ''A'' in his surname.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan is plain-spoken and still adjusting to the transition to candidate, having to read briefing books rather than being able to catnap on planes, and needing to shake every hand instead of smiling in the background. She said she misses being called by her given name.</p>
        <p>''It's a job you can learn like anything else you can learn,'' she said, with a shrug. ''People still see me as a symbol of picking up, going forward, and doing what needs to be done. In a way, that is what's happening in our country right now.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan often mentions her role in negotiating the merger between American Airlines and Trans World Airlines, which is based in St. Louis, and in writing an amendment to give school districts flexibility in spending federal dollars.</p>
        <p>She also talks about visiting troops in Afghanistan. Her staff points out that she voted 71 percent of the time with the president, supported the tax cut and is ranked among the top 10 centrist Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carnahan recently took up the theme of corporate responsibility, and this morning, she spoke on the floor of the Senate about a bill she wrote to require online disclosure of stock sales by executives.</p>
        <p>Just as often, Mrs. Carnahan invokes destiny.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't have lived with myself if I hadn't done this,'' she said. ''We would not have a majority in the Senate today. Things would be totally different in our country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent, whose $90,000 job teaching a single university course and $25,000 lobbying contract have angered editorialists, dismisses the issue of Senate control, though he is one of three Republican challengers whom President Bush calls the ''Three Amigos.'' Mr. Talent would rather point out Mrs. Carnahan's votes against confirming Mr. Ashcroft as attorney general and against repealing the estate tax, or discuss his leadership of the House small business committee, where he pushed consolidated health care plans, and higher military spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent is a comfortable candidate, never straying from talking points as he moves deftly among issues. On Thursday, he marveled at a water-jet machine that cuts aluminum during a tour of a 44-employee parts manufacturer in Steelville, Mo., and he made sure his aides assembled a chamber-of-commerce crowd for fried chicken at the Hometown Cafe in the town of 1,465.</p>
        <p>Mr. Talent says he has stopped trying to manage low-level campaign logistics. At 3,000 feet, when the pilot of his rented Cessna Golden Eagle 421 announced that fog would prevent a landing in Washington, Mo., where Mr. Talent was supposed to meet with an influential newspaper editor, the candidate barely broke his patter of accomplishments and goals.</p>
        <p>The tiny airport in Cuba, Mo., was closed, too. Same story in Sullivan. So the plane turned back to St. Louis, where Mr. Talent, fueled with a cup of McDonald's coffee, climbed into the back seat of a sport utility vehicle -- which he thought they should have taken in the first place -- and arrived 25 minutes late for the hastily arranged factory tour in Steelville.</p>
        <p>''I've learned not to worry about this stuff,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Finally.''</p>
