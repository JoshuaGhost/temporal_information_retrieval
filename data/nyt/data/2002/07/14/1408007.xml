        <p>AT 10:30 on any clear Friday night, Jason Post of St. James rushes out of the house and into the 2002 Volkswagen Jetta his mother bought him for a high school graduation gift. The 18-year-old's destination: Deer Park Avenue in Babylon, Long Island's cruising hot spot, where he is sure to find others like himself, those with modified cars and a penchant for speed.</p>
        <p>''They basically meet and greet, drive side by side under the speed limit and constantly turn around, which causes congestion,'' said Inspector James Rhoads, commander of the Suffolk County Police Department's First Precinct, which includes Deer Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>Car owners size each other up along Deer Park Avenue. the driver of a modified Honda Civic may acknowledge the huge tail-wing and slick paint job of an Acura Integra with a thumbs up. The same treatment on a Volkswagon Jetta might earn its driver a comment about driving ''Eurotrash.'' Many Suffolk County Volkswagen owners who cruise the avenue call the drivers of modified Japanese cars ''rice rockets'' and their drivers ''rice boys.'' And of course the owners of American muscle cars despise all imports equally.</p>
        <p>But, come 12:30 a.m., some of the cruisers leave the strip, usually looking for deserted industrial complexes or parking lots, communicating with each other on their cell phones, spreading word of the location for that evening's secret rendezvous. Once there, they race.</p>
        <p>A favorite site is the New Horizons Business Center adjacent to Wellwood Avenue in North Amityville. As racers and spectators arrive, they park their cars along the shoulder and watch modified imports race in pairs down New Horizons Boulevard. On a busy night, more than 50 cars can show up. As racers shut down the road, the occasional motorist must wait until a race is finished to pass.</p>
        <p>The rules of street racing are simple: opponents line up, wait for a starter's signal and floor the throttle. At New Horizons, racers are able to complete a quarter-mile before the road veers sharply right. Three taps of brake lights let the crowd gathered at the starting line know who won.</p>
        <p>For some, much more than the egos and bragging rights are at stake. These racers bet serious cash and even ''pink slips'' - the titles to their cars.</p>
        <p>Different types of cars tend to congregate in different locations. Owners of muscle cars like Camaros, Mustangs and Corvettes, built for straight-line speed, favor the parking lot at Stables Gardens shopping center at the south end of Deer Park Avenue, where they wait, sometimes as late as 3 a.m. Then, in caravan fashions, they motor north under the Long Island Expressway, turn left and park on the shoulder of the service road between exits 51 and 50. A group of spectators closes off the road while cars race, hitting speeds over 150 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Those who want to race in the wee hours on the Southern state Parkway contact Joe from Valley Stream. This 20-something, who asked that his last name be withheld, considers himself an entrepreneur, arranging races and taking bets. ''Most races start between $2,500 and $3,000,'' he said. ''You have to have a fast car, nine or ten seconds in the quarter-mile to be considered.''</p>
        <p>Joe requires owners to produce a time-ticket from a legal drag strip to prove their cars are fast enough.</p>
        <p>Most races last only 15 to 20 seconds, and the racers drive back to the start line to go again. Pairings tend to be at random early on, until a pecking order is established. Then top cars square off against each other.</p>
        <p>Late into the night as the racers find a groove, the atmosphere relaxes as they chat, smoke, drink and mingle in the crowd of spectators. The strong smell of burnt rubber and exhaust and the loud whine of engines racing past their tachometer redlines don't stop the socializing. But blue and red lights do.</p>
        <p>The cry of ''Popo! Popo!,'' slang for the police, transforms a street-racing scene into chaos as spectators bolt for their vehicles and try to escape. One weekend night in June, when a pair of Suffolk County patrol cars closed in on the racers from both directions, racers took to curbs and sidewalks in an effort to get away. When the operation was over, only a few cars were caught, and the cellphone grapevine was full of callers saying they had made it out O.K.</p>
        <p>Engaging in a speed contest is a misdemeanor, but actual racers aren't the only ones who can face arrest. ''Everyone involved in the race can be charged, the starter, the drivers, passengers,'' said Inspector Rhoads. Spectators are not subject to arrest, but can be ticketed, he said.</p>
        <p>But in fact, street racing arrests are infrequent. Deputy Inspector Robert Oswald of the First Precinct said the Suffolk County police had made no such arrests this year and ''a few'' last year, but didn't have statistics. The state Department of Motor Vehicles reported that in 2000, the last year for which statistics were available, there were 15 convictions and 7 crashes relating to street racing. Two of the convictions were in Nassau and one in Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Inspector Oswald said that stopping organized street racing requires knowing where racers will be ahead of schedule - and that requires intelligence. ''First, we have to be notified by the local sector car, and then we can send out unmarked cars to do surveillance,'' he said. Once the unmarked cars determine that racing is in progress, patrol cars are sent to the scene. This complicated operation is made more difficult by the fact that racers often disperse and reconvene at different locations through the night.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk police also target racers using video cameras mounted on telephone poles in affected areas. Daytime patrols look for signs for racing, like painted starting lines and heavy rubbermarks on the road, and relay this information to the night patrols.</p>
        <p>But many of the racers tearing through Suffolk were driven out of Queens and Brooklyn, where street racing congregations of more than 200 cars and 1,000 spectators were common until the authorities there cracked down. The city dug speed ditches into the surface of one hot spot, Vandalia Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn, and the New York Police Department increased ticketing and patrols in marked cars.</p>
        <p>While the racers moved east, they seemed to pass on Nassau County. ''We do not have an area with that kind of problem, with congregation and a formal street setting where people race,'' said Lt. Kevin Smith, a Nassau County Police Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>But informal racing continues, sometimes with deadly results. In June 2001, a race between a Lamborghini and a Corvette on Lawson Boulevard in Oceanside ended in the death of one of the drivers and the driver of an uninvolved Volvo.</p>
        <p>In Muttontown last month, a Westbury couple were killed when their Jeep was hit by two teenagers, who Nassau County prosecutors say were driving a Corvette and a Mercedes over 100 m.p.h. on Route 106.</p>
        <p>A 2001 poll by Response Insurance, a national auto-only insurance company, attributed 21 percent of crashes to racing with another car. Yet, advocacy groups for motorists like the American Automobile Association have not really examined the illegal street-racing trend. Eric Strum, a spokesman for the National Motorists Association, said that drag racing doesn't happen often enough to catch their attention.</p>
        <p>''The best advice for drivers is to be aware,'' he said. ''If someone is speeding or tailgating you and you are driving at a steady pace with traffic, then something is wrong. The smart thing is to just move out of the way.''</p>
        <p>Drag racers have legal options. Long Island Motorsports Park in Westhampton and Raceway Park in Englishtown, N.J., both offer a timed, controlled environment for racers. But it costs $45 to race at Long Island Raceway and $20 at Raceway Park, and street racers complain that both tracks are too far away, that Long Island Motorsports Park is too expensive and in poor condition and that contestants have to wear a helmet.</p>
        <p>What it boils down to is that most of the excitement of street racing comes from its illegality.</p>
        <p>''They keep talking about building legal racetracks nearby, but that will never happen,'' said Rob from Brentwood, is one of the chief organizers for import street racers. ''And even if they do, who wants to go there? They make you wear a helmet and check to see if your car is legal. A lot of these cars aren't legal.''</p>
        <p>After leaving his day job at the post office, Rob takes a nap, then heads out for a night of starting cars. He painstakingly lines each car's nose on the starting line, alerts the drivers and drops his arms signaling ''go.'' Even in these races, which have no clock or accurate finish line, precision is key.</p>
        <p>Many of the performance enhancing parts on these cars, especially those that modify emissions components, are not legal for use on public highways. Most aftermarket super-chargers, turbo kits and modified fuel delivery systems are illegal in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Post acknowledge that he had engaged in an impromptu race here and there, but said he steered clear of the more organized drag racing venues. He said he did not want to chance having his car impounded as evidence if he is charged with engaging in a speed contest.</p>
        <p>''So far, I have spent about $7,000 on the car,'' Mr. Post said. ''The DVD player cost $3,000 to finish the car.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Post works at CompUSA in Hauppauge as a sales associate and is enrolled for the fall semester at Suffolk County Community College. He has dreams of working as a stock-broker.</p>
        <p>Most of the modifications Mr. Post has made so far are for cruising. But the next round of modifications be is planning will make his car more competitive off the line: a super-charger, lowered suspension and 18-inch rim and tires.</p>
        <p>''I'm not into extreme wings and things like that,'' Mr. Post said. ''I'm going for a more European look. My mother knows about how much I spend on the car. As long as it makes me happy, it's cool. My mom would rather have me work on my car and know where I am rather than drink and do drugs.''</p>
        <p>Would his mom agree? ''Oh, absolutely,'' said Melinda Post, 44. ''If this is what his hobby is, and he is driving safely, then it is O.K. I would rather have him focus on cars than drugs.''</p>
