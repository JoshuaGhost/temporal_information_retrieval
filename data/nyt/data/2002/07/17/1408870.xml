        <p>Amgen, already the biggest biotechnology company, announced yesterday that it had completed its acquisition of Immunex, gaining control of the rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel.</p>
        <p>The cash-and-stock deal was valued at less than $10 billion, down from the $16 billion valuation when the move was announced last December. Amgen's stock, along with that of many biotechnology companies, has fallen sharply since then.</p>
        <p>Kevin Sharer, chairman and chief executive of Amgen, said in an interview that sales of Enbrel might be lower than Amgen expected this year and next. ''Some of the things we assumed last December in supply and patient levels appear to be lower than we projected,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he said he remained enthusiastic about the long-term potential of Enbrel, which had $762 million in sales last year. Amgen predicts that sales will reach $3 billion by 2005. He said a new factory in Rhode Island to produce the drug could be in line to win regulatory approval by the end of this year, faster than Amgen's official projection of the first quarter of next year.</p>
        <p>Combining the companies will result in a 5 percent reduction of the combined work force, or about 400 to 500 people, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharer said Amgen was not looking for acquisitions, especially in the near future. ''I don't predict that we will ever do another acquisition, but I don't deny it's possible,'' he said. He said Immunex was a unique property because of Enbrel.</p>
        <p>He also played down speculation that Amgen itself might be taken over by a big drug company looking to match Pfizer's announced acquisition of Pharmacia. He said that there had been talk of Amgen's being acquired for years but that nothing had come of it.</p>
        <p>''We fiercely want to be independent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Amgen's shares, which fell sharply on Monday, rose $1.80, or almost 6 percent, to $32.87.</p>
