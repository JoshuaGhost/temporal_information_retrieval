        <p>The death toll from a savage Saturday night attack on a shantytown in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir climbed to 27 today. Indian officials expressed outrage at the incident, but the government avoided pointing the finger while it prepared its official response.</p>
        <p>Some officials, though, did blame Pakistan, which India has accused of sponsoring frequent attacks by Islamic militants seeking to wrest control of the Kashmir Valley.</p>
        <p>The two nuclear-armed countries nearly went to war in May after an attack by militants on Indian soldiers and their families killed 32 people. India blamed Pakistan for the strike. Both nations then came under heavy international, particularly American, pressure to draw down.</p>
        <p>After the May attack, American diplomats secured a promise from Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharaff, to stop militants from crossing into India across the Line of Control that separates Indian- and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Indian officials cited a subsequent decrease in incursions, but some officials have recently accused Pakistan of reneging on its promise.</p>
        <p>India's deputy prime minister, Lal Krishna Advani, visited Jammu today and called the attack ''terrorism in its most basic form.'' But he said the government needed to collect evidence to determine responsibility.</p>
        <p>Pakistan also condemned the killings, describing the assault as a ''terrorist attack.'' A statement from the foreign ministry said that ''the motivation behind the attack seems to be to enhance tension in the region.''</p>
        <p>The attack on the slum of Rajiv Nagar did strain the region's fragile peace. Three to five guerrillas, with at least some dressed in the clothing of Hindu worshipers, attacked a tea stall with grenades and then opened fire with rifles about 7:30 p.m. Saturday, killing 13 men, 13 women, and one child. At least 28 people were wounded. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
        <p>The victims were mostly Hindu seasonal laborers who had put up tents and shanties on Jammu's outskirts, next to a jungle into which the attackers escaped.</p>
        <p>Distraught residents of Rajiv Nagar today angrily accosted Mr. Advani and the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah, saying the government had failed to protect them. Mr. Abdullah blamed Pakistan for the attack.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is expected to visit the region within weeks, called the attackers ''terrorist thugs'' who are ''outside the pale of the civilized world.''</p>
