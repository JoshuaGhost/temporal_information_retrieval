        <p>An armed standoff between the government and farmers determined not to lose their land to the construction of a new airport on the northeast side of the capital seemed headed toward a fragile settlement tonight.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, the governor of the state of Mexico, Arturo Montiel, offered to release the peasant leaders who had been arrested at the start of the violent protests that erupted in the community of San Salvador Atenco on Thursday. At least eight protesters were released tonight, but two leaders remained in jail.</p>
        <p>In a news conference tonight, Interior Secretary Santiago Creel said the federal government was willing to negotiate the terms for the construction of the international airport. And radio interviews with farmers in San Salvador Atenco, who are holding at least a dozen hostages, said they were willing to listen.</p>
        <p>Since Thursday the police, and later soldiers, set up perimeters around the community of some 34,000 people. Meanwhile the farmers and hundreds of supporters from across the country were holed up with machetes and gasoline bombs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Creel said, ''We are convinced that we are going to find a solution through dialogue.'' In a radio interview, Miguel Buendia, a protest leader, said if that was true, ''we are ready for dialogue.''</p>
        <p>There were, however, those who refused to give in. Some peasant leaders said they would not surrender their blockades and one, in an interview televised from jail, said the farmers would not give up their land to the government for any price.</p>
        <p>The farmers' lands are being expropriated, many at a cost of about 6 cents a square foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Creel said tonight that the low assessment price was forced by law, and added that the government was willing to negotiate other benefits, from new houses and schools to long-range jobs at the airport for the villagers and their offspring.</p>
