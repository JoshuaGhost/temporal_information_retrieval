      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The pizza-eating world has gone through its fads: deep-dish, which is just another reason to go slim on the sauce and hefty on the crust; white pizza, an excuse to keep tablecloths from being stained with tomato; and stuffed crust, which is inexplicable and requires a crane to lift. Then there is Mack's of Stone Harbor, just a couple of blocks south of the border with Avalon on what is known as Seven-Mile Island. Stone Harbor and Avalon have gotten uppity reputations of late, but Mack's is as down home as they come. Try the Wildwood, a simple $17 wonder with sausage, onions, green peppers and extra cheese. The crust is thin, but holds the toppings with just the right amount of firmness. On the other hand, it is not as stiff as the cardboard-like stuff you get at chain pizza joints. You may have to do the old head-back, slide-a-wedge-down-the-gullet trick, but that is the way pizza was meant to be eaten, especially at the shore. The tomato sauce on Mack's pizza is not the usual bland stuff but nicely spiced with oregano and a little garlic. The isn't just a few blotches of white, but covers the entire pie, and there are accompanying pools of grease. The veggies are fresh and the sausage is cut before your eyes. One extra at Mack's is the see-through rotating brick pizza oven. It cooks the pizza evenly, which is all-important in a thin-crust pie. It also keeps the oven tenders from burning their forearms, so you always have a smile coming from your server. Mack's is not one of those new-fangled pizza palaces that has arugula-and-hearts-of-palm salads and pastas you've never heard of. It's pizza and nonalcoholic drinks and that's it. At Mack's, that's enough. If it's not crowded and your children are lucky, they'll get a piece of dough, not crayons, to play with.</p>
