        <p>At Camp Mariah it was, ''Hold the hot meal; the special of the day is cool jazz.''</p>
        <p>This month, the dining hall at Mariah, a Fresh Air Fund camp in Fishkill, N.Y., was the setting for the 2002 Fresh Air Jazz Festival, produced by JazzReach, a nonprofit group committed to jazz education. That afternoon, campers became hipsters. Instead of the clatter of cutlery, there were the snapping of fingers and the tapping of toes. And the Metta Quintet was serving up something special.</p>
        <p>After two performances, more than 600 campers were left with an appetite for jazz, and a better appreciation of role models and mentors.</p>
        <p>The campers, 8 to 16 years old, represented five camps in Fishkill run by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit organization that has been providing country vacations to children from low-income New York City neighborhoods for 125 years.</p>
        <p>Being more familiar with rap, many of the children were not sure what to expect.</p>
        <p>A few of the youngest ones did not quite get the sophisticated rhythms, and their attention wandered like a jazzy bass line. But for many others, it was a chance to hear live what they had experienced only through recordings or the radio.</p>
        <p>Once onstage, the Metta Quintet wailed. Helen Sung played a thunderous piano; Marcus Strickland blazed on tenor and soprano saxophone; the bassist, Joshua Ginsburg, showed his dexterity; and Hans Schuman, founder of JazzReach and its quintet, molded and steered the tempo with his delicate cymbal work. In the final number, Mark Gross poured emotion out of an alto sax.</p>
        <p>''I like the saxophone,'' said LeChell Rush, 11, of Brooklyn. ''It has a nice tune and it is nice and loud.''</p>
        <p>Vernice Miller, the festival's master of ceremonies, guided the campers through the musical adventure. She began with a short history of jazz and its role in American history.</p>
        <p>Doug Weitz, Camp Mariah's director, said: ''It's important for kids to understand the roots of American music, and jazz is American as anything, African-American as anything. These kids need to understand where the music they love comes from.''</p>
        <p>Jazz offers subtle -- and larger -- lessons than just enjoyment, Mr. Weitz said. ''Jazz musicians adapt together and work together and achieve this one sound,'' he said. ''At camp the kids also learn to work with others and realize what is perceived as different is a strength.''</p>
        <p>Gaining strength by following the example of others was the major theme. Each original composition was chosen to pay tribute to a musician's role model or mentor.</p>
        <p>After a piece was played, the musician who had chosen it spoke about the role model who inspired the choice. In some cases, it was a jazz legend, like Thelonious Monk. In others, it was a parent, a brother or a favorite teacher.</p>
        <p>After the concert, Kewanda Wilson, 12, of Manhattan, thought about mentors. ''My mother, she inspires me to do stuff,'' said Kewanda. ''If I say I don't like something, she would tell me not to quit and when I finish I learn to like it.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, the quintet, a revolving ensemble of professional musicians, performs multimedia programs at places like the Kennedy Center in Washington, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Music Center of Los Angeles County. This year, the group released its first CD, ''Going to Meet the Man,'' inspired by the short stories of James Baldwin.</p>
        <p>At the Fresh Air Fund camps, music education is one of the many courses in a curriculum that varies from place to place.</p>
        <p>The first Fresh Air Jazz Festival was produced by Mr. Schuman in 1999 at Camp Mariah, with financing from Kenneth Cole.</p>
        <p>The second festival was made possible this year through a $10,000 grant to JazzReach from the Music for Youth Foundation, a nonprofit Manhattan group that supports music education for underprivileged children. The group will perform again at Camp Mariah on Aug. 14.</p>
        <p>''JazzReach encourages an outreach to kids to music that they aren't familiar with,'' said Timothy J. Thomas, executive director of the Music for Youth Foundation. ''They don't simplify music; they give them full-on artistic performance, and we hope it will inspire kids to pick up an instrument.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schuman said he hoped to spark more interest in jazz.</p>
        <p>''After every concert,'' he said, ''I just want jazz to equal fun.''</p>
