        <p>MOST people in Clinton knew very little about George Flynn, until he died in 1997 at the age of 93.</p>
        <p>''He was a sublimely eccentric, largely unknown recluse,'' said Elaine Godowsky, president of the concert series that bears his name. ''But he left two million dollars to support an ongoing set of free concerts in his lifelong hometown.</p>

        <p>MOST people in Clinton knew very little about George Flynn, until he died in 1997 at the age of 93.</p>
        <p>''He was a sublimely eccentric, largely unknown recluse,'' said Elaine Godowsky, president of the concert series that bears his name. ''But he left two million dollars to support an ongoing set of free concerts in his lifelong hometown.</p>
        <p>''So far as we know, ours is the only small town in America to have received such a significant bequest in the service of classical music.''</p>
        <p>Thus far, the programs have brought to Clinton such esteemed artists and ensembles as the pianist Earl Wild, the Emerson String Quartet and the New Haven Symphony.</p>
        <p>The tradition will continue Aug. 18 at 8 p.m. when Canadian Brass performs on the grounds of Morgan High School (off exit 63 of I-95.) The concerts will continue in the fall with visits from the Arden Trio and the Girls Choir of Harlem.</p>
        <p>Information: (860) 669-1208.</p>
        <p>The bells are ringing at another free series, this one devoted to the distinctive sounds of the 54-bell carillon at Yale University.</p>
        <p>Playing the first two recitals, Aug. 2 and 9, respectively, are Ellen Espenschied and Dan Kehoe. Kenneth Shevlin and Emily Johnson will perform Aug. 14 at 7 p.m. with George Matthew coming from Brandon, Vt., to conclude the cycle Aug. 16. The recitals will feature a mix of classical music, original carillon compositions and modern favorites.</p>
        <p>The Branford College Courtyard is a good place to hear the carillon, which is in Harkness Tower. Bring a blanket or lawn chair (seating is not provided). If it rains, an indoor space will be provided. Information: (203) 432-2309.</p>
        <p>Festivals Coming and Going</p>
        <p>Next Friday at 8 p.m. is the finale to the chamber series at the Silvermine Guild Arts Center in New Canaan and its presentation of Imani Winds. The quintet comprises musicians of Latino and African-American heritage (Imani, in Swahili means ''faith''), and has stated its mission is ''bridging European and African musical traditions, and exploring repertory from diverse cultural backgrounds.''</p>
        <p>Reservations: (203) 966-9700.</p>
        <p>Also next Friday evening at 8, the 33rd summer of Chestnut Hill Concerts begins at First Congregational Church of Madison, under the artistic direction of the cellist Ronald Thomas. Music by Beethoven and Martinu are featured on the first two of the four consecutive Fridays, with more Martinu and Beethoven, plus a Schubert Trio on Aug. 9.</p>
        <p>Mozart, Mendelssohn and Dvorak are the composers of note Aug. 16, Haydn, Brahms and Shostakovich will be on display at the Aug. 23 finale. Joining Mr. Thomas are such colleagues as Cynthia Phelps, the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic, the horn virtuoso William Purvis, the violinist Jennifer Frautschi and the pianist Randall Hodgkinson. For a list of artists: (203) 245-5736.</p>
        <p>Chamber Music and More</p>
        <p>An evening marking the centennial of Richard Rodgers will be celebrated Friday at 8 as part of the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival. Rodgers's collaborations with both Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein will be sung and played by the baritone Richard Lalli, the pianist Gary Chapman and the Flipside Jazz Quintet.</p>
        <p>The next evening at Norfolk, it is back to classical business as usual, as the resident Tokyo String Quartet plays Schubert's Quartettsatz, the Piano Quartet of Beethoven and Brahms's Clarinet Quintet, with John O'Conor and David Krakauer as the guest artists in the last two works.</p>
        <p>When the Tokyos return Aug. 10, it will be for Dvorak and Brahms in the musical company of the pianist Peter Frankl and violist Jesse Levine; their final recital, Aug. 17, lists Haydn's F Minor String Quartet, Joan Tower's ''In Memory'' (commissioned by the ensemble), and with the assistance of the festival director, Joan Panetti, the F Minor Brahms Piano Quintet.</p>
        <p>Reservations and information: (860) 542-3000.</p>
        <p>A few miles away at Music Mountain, Mark Kroll, for two decades the harpsichordist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, will give a baroque recital this Friday evening at 8.</p>
        <p>Coming from considerably farther away is the Kuymo Asiana String Quartet of Korea, with concerts at 8 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. next Sunday afternoon, both with the assistance of Pedja Muzijevic, the Zagreb-born pianist. The music of Mozart and Shostakovich dominates both programs, with Smetana's ''From My Life'' Quartet as an added starter on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Yet to come on Sunday afternoons are the Da Ponte String Quartet, with the pianists Pamela Mia Paul (Aug. 11) and Laura Kargul (Aug. 18), and the Blair String Quartet with guest pianist Amy Dorfman (Aug. 25).</p>
        <p>Tickets: (860) 824-7126.</p>
        <p>Also on the calendar next weekend are three days of music making at the seventh annual Litchfield Jazz Festival. The headliners at the opening gala, Friday evening at 7 on the Goshen Fairgrounds, are Diane Schuur and Sonny Rollins (winner of a 2002 Grammy for his latest CD, ''This Is What I Do'').</p>
        <p>John Benitez, Bill Charlap, Antoine Silverman and the Mary Stallings-Eric Reed Duo take charge Saturday afternoon, at noon, 1:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., respectively.</p>
        <p>Eric Alexander, Tom Harrell, Danilo Perez and Kenny Werner will appear with the Brussels Jazz Orchestra at those same hours next Sunday. Evenings bring out the big names: the octogenarian harmonica wizard Toots Thilemans leads off Saturday at 7 p.m., followed by the Mingus Big Band at 8:30 p.m.; Kenny Rankin and Pasquita D'Rivera are featured at those same hours next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Information: (860) 567-4162.</p>
        <p>Since July 22, dozens of area youngsters have been coaching, rehearsing and performing at the Stamford Center for the Arts' 10th annual Summer Jazz Workshop.</p>
        <p>The graduation concert at the Rich Forum, featuring student and faculty players, is Friday evening at 7:30; it is listed as a fund-raiser for the Center's ''Reach Out'' community project, with tickets priced at $5. Box office: (203) 325-4466.</p>
        <p>The Trumbull Jazz Festival takes place Aug. 17 from noon to 10 p.m. at Indian Ledge Park. The town's resident guitarist, Tony Purrone, will be there, along with Lew Anderson's All-American Big Jazz Band, Phil Baker and his Pocket Jungle Quartet and at least four other combos of varying size.</p>
        <p>All parking will be at the high school, with free shuttle bus service provided to Indian Ledge Park.</p>
