        <p>Traveling Salesmen</p>
        <p>Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom are taking their show on the road. In other words, the national tour of the hit Mel Brooks musical ''The Producers'' is in the works. With Lewis J. Stadlen as the conniving Max and Don Stephenson as his partner in theatrical crime, the tour will start with a three-week engagement beginning on Sept. 10 at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh and after stops in Cleveland; Cincinnati; Minneapolis; St. Louis; San Diego; Tempe, Ariz.; Seattle; and Portland, Ore., will wind up in San Francisco at the Orpheum Theater from March 4 to April 27).</p>
        <p>All This Jazz</p>
        <p>From the archives comes a 1949 Italian recording regarded as the last and one of the most significant by the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt and the violinist Stephane Grappelli. Along with it, from 1970, comes the disk billed as Louis Armstrong's last recording. Just released, they are part of the Bluebird First Editions series of reissues from the vaults of the RCA Victor Group. ''Djangology,'' recorded in Rome, features songs like ''Honeysuckle Rose,'' ''All the Things You Are'' and ''I Got Rhythm'' as well as an improvisation on Tchaikovsky's ''Pathétique'' Symphony. ''Louis Armstrong and His Friends,'' from three sessions to celebrate his 70th birthday, found him too ill to play the trumpet but still able to sing. On hand were friends and peers like Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman and Tony Bennett, and the material ranges from Duke Ellington's ''Mood Indigo'' to John Lennon's ''Give Peace a Chance.''</p>

        <p>On the Waterfront</p>
        <p>Where Jenny Lind sang in 1850, the sixth annual series of free Thursday sunset concerts will open at 7 tomorrow. Presented as part of the Downtown N.Y.C. River to River Festival, the Music at Castle Clinton series in Battery Park will begin with a performance by the singer-songwriter Jane Siberry, preceded by Chocolate Genius. The series continues through Aug. 8. Tickets, limited to two a person, will be distributed at 5 p.m. For those who can't get in, the music will be piped into the park.</p>
        <p>Art History</p>
        <p>At first, only black ink was used in the creation of Japanese woodblock prints. But by the mid-18th century, color pigments were applied, and the art form evolved from early private calendars to commercially marketed prints. By the mid-1760's, artists were depicting classical and contemporary scenes, including those from literature or the lives of the famous, as well as beautiful women, travelogues, actors and daily and erotic activities. The evolution of this art is explored in an exhibition of 16 woodblock prints through Sept. 1 at the Princeton University Art Museum, open to the public without charge, in Princeton, N.J.</p>
