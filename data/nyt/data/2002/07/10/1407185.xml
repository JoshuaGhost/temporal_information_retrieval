      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The family of a maintenance worker killed by a roller coaster at Lake Compounce Theme Park in Bristol has sued the park, accusing it of inadequately training personnel in operating the roller coaster. The worker, Wilfredo Martinez, was struck last year by the roller coaster, the Boulder Dash, while cutting weeds underneath it. The suit, filed Friday in Superior Court in Waterbury on behalf of Mr. Martinez's estate, claims managers should have trained mechanics not to conduct tests while workers were under the tracks. Tom Wages, a park manager, said the suit was without merit. Mr. Martinez's death was the third at the park in three years.</p>
