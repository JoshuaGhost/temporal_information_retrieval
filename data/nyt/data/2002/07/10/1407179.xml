        <p>Two police officers were suspended on Monday for drinking while on duty, the police said yesterday. The officers, Michael Toomey and John Busacco, are plainclothes officers assigned to the Transit Bureau's Manhattan task force. They were discovered in Smith's Bar and Restaurant at Eighth Avenue and 44th Street, at 9:10 p.m. on Monday when they should have been patrolling the subway, the police said. Officer Busacco, an eight-year veteran, had a bottle of beer in front of him. Officer Toomey, a nine-year veteran, had only a ginger ale in front of him, but he and Officer Busacco were not authorized to be in the bar, the police said. Each has been suspended for 30 days without pay, the police said.</p>
