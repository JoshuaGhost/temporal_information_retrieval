        <p>Teenagers remember commercials for the growing number of alcoholic beverages that are brewed and sold like beer, according to a survey by an advocacy group seeking to curb marketing of the products, known as malternatives or alcopops.</p>
        <p>The survey, which was released last week, was conducted by the Global Strategy Group in Washington for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. The survey found that 73 percent of respondents ages 12 to 18 had seen commercials for the beverages.</p>
        <p>When asked which products the commercials were promoting, without suggestions of individual brands, more than 10 percent of the 750 respondents named brands like Smirnoff Ice, Mike's Hard Lemonade and Bacardi Silver. When the respondents were read a list of products, 62 percent said they had seen a spot for Smirnoff Ice, followed by 58 percent for Mike's Hard Lemonade, 52 percent for Zima, 45 percent for Coors Vibe, 40 percent for Bacardi Silver and 30 percent for Skyy Blue.</p>
        <p>The Distilled Spirits Council in Washington, which represents the alcoholic beverage industry, dismissed the survey as a ''publicity stunt rerun.''</p>
        <p>Frank Coleman, senior vice president for the council, said in a statement that the survey was ''blatantly ignoring the federal government's action on this issue,'' referring to a yearlong investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which concluded last month that the makers of malternatives were not aiming their ads at consumers under the legal drinking age.</p>
