        <p>Some money managers are beginning to say that the pharmaceutical industry has suffered enough. At beaten-down prices, the stocks are likely to be good long-term investments, they say, whether or not the industry quickly benefits from a wave of mergers.</p>
        <p>Over the last year, investors have treated pharmaceutical stocks worse than the overall market. One drug stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb, has lost more than half its value in 2002.</p>
        <p>The drug companies have made numerous missteps: bets on the wrong products, run-ins with regulators, and failures to quell talk in Washington and elsewhere that prices are susceptible to being reduced. Skeptics see few potential blockbuster new drugs, and the companies face fierce competition from generic drug manufacturers as some of their best-selling products lose patent protection.</p>
        <p>''As value investors, we rarely get to go into an industry like this,'' said David N. Dreman, a money manager well known for his opportunistic eye and who has recently invested in stocks like Bristol-Myers. ''I just don't believe the drug industry is dead.''</p>
        <p>The news yesterday that Pfizer would acquire Pharmacia helped lift the prices of a few stocks. Pharmacia shares rose 20 percent, or $6.66 a share. The prospect of future combinations also buoyed Bristol-Myers shares, up about 5 percent, or $1.20, and Eli Lilly, which rose 2.7 percent, or $1.35.</p>
        <p>But some other pharmaceutical stocks met with skepticism. Pfizer's stock was pummeled, down $3.42 to $28.78, on the rich premium it is paying for Pharmacia and disappointing earnings news. Shares of Wyeth, formerly American Home Products, and Schering-Plough also declined.</p>
        <p>Trading at levels last seen in the mid-1990's, when talk of health care reform rattled investors, the drug stocks as a group now appear to have an attractive valuation, some portfolio managers say.</p>
        <p>Based on their estimated earnings growth, the stocks are trading at a significant discount to the overall market, though they have traditionally been valued at a premium of 15 to 20 percent to the market.</p>
        <p>''It seems peculiar to us that a technology-based, soundly growing business should trade at a discount,'' said Samuel D. Isaly, who manages the Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences Fund. He estimates that the industry will generate annual earnings growth over the next five years in the high single digits to low double digits.</p>
        <p>Despite their price, and yesterday's news, investors may not be able to count on a quick recovery. Dr. Kris Jenner, who manages the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund, said, ''Right now, I think they are in a troughing process, and I think there are some outstanding, outstanding bargains in the pharmaceutical sector if you have a three-year horizon.''</p>
        <p>While Dr. Jenner acknowledges many of the industry's fundamental problems, including an inability to improve productivity, he still sees tremendous promise because of the possibility of finding new treatments for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and cancer. ''What we're seeing is a normal cyclical pattern but not a secular change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Wyeth's stock, for example, has fallen by about a third over the last year, largely a result of a recent study that showed that one of the company's hormone-replacement therapies was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jenner argues that investors have overreacted to the news. ''Wyeth is not a one-product company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers's practice of enticing wholesalers to buy too much of some products has led to big write-offs and an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''I think it's been pushed down too far,'' Mr. Dreman said. While Bristol has often been mentioned as a possible acquisition target, the S.E.C. inquiry will probably delay any possible combination for several months, he said.</p>
        <p>Even Merck's recent brush with accounting controversy, which has punished its stock price, does not give Mr. Dreman and Mr. Isaly too much pause. The company's policy of booking revenue for its Medco unit had no impact on earnings, Mr. Dreman said, adding, ''I think it's a pretty good company.'' Merck's share price is down by nearly a quarter over the last 12 months. Mr. Isaly, who was more critical, said the company suffered from a weak pipeline of new drugs.</p>
        <p>Because of the difficult environment, many investors think that the industry is likely to undergo further consolidation. Companies that have already gone through successful acquisitions, like Pfizer had with Warner-Lambert, are good candidates for future deals, according to Mr. Isaly.</p>
        <p>GlaxoSmithKline, for example, was successful in combining Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, and Novartis is a combination of the Swiss drug makers Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy. Some of the smaller companies might also combine, he said.</p>
        <p>Mergers may not do much, he said, to solve the industry's main problem -- a lack of innovation as many top-selling products are being threatened by competition when they lose patent protection.</p>
        <p>''The size of the combined company brings benefits of size and brings detriments of size,'' Mr. Isaly said.</p>
        <p>While the merged company can save costs, by laying off workers, there are no economies of scale involved in drug development. ''You've got to discover new drugs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the case of Pfizer, whose purchase of Pharmacia would create a giant with nearly $50 billion in annual revenue, Mr. Isaly was not concerned about the effect on research and development, saying the company knew how to manage size.</p>
        <p>Even if there is less than they would like in the labs, these managers have faith that the companies will eventually prosper by coming up with something new.</p>
        <p>''Analysts always want the blockbusters now,'' said Mr. Dreman, adding that investors have been able to profit by taking a somewhat longer view. ''Those pipelines, over time, tend to pay off.''</p>
        <p>Profit, despite the bleak outlook this year, is also expected to recover at some point. ''We just have to wait it out,'' Mr. Isaly said.</p>
