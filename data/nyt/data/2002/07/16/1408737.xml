        <p>Jan Morris recalls serene light of very Swiss room at Hotel Beau-Rivage Weggis on Lake Lucerne, where he likes to imagine himself on gloomy, drizzly morning at home in Wales; photo (special section, Favorites) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>OFTEN enough when I awake in the morning to the patter of Welsh drizzle on my roof, and reluctantly bestir myself to plod downstairs and make breakfast, I like to imagine that instead I am snugly waiting for room service in one of my favorite hotels. The one most likely to figure in this forlorn fantasy is the Hotel Beau-Rivage Weggis in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>It is not a grandiloquent hotel, nor one of those boutique hostelries, but a comfortably bourgeois, very Swiss establishment on the northern shore of Lake Lucerne. I have been stopping off there for years when I drive across Europe, so it is all too easy for me to fancy I am in one of its sunlit lake-view bedrooms instead of groping for the light switch in the morning gloom of Wales.</p>

        <p>OFTEN enough when I awake in the morning to the patter of Welsh drizzle on my roof, and reluctantly bestir myself to plod downstairs and make breakfast, I like to imagine that instead I am snugly waiting for room service in one of my favorite hotels. The one most likely to figure in this forlorn fantasy is the Hotel Beau-Rivage Weggis in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>It is not a grandiloquent hotel, nor one of those boutique hostelries, but a comfortably bourgeois, very Swiss establishment on the northern shore of Lake Lucerne. I have been stopping off there for years when I drive across Europe, so it is all too easy for me to fancy I am in one of its sunlit lake-view bedrooms instead of groping for the light switch in the morning gloom of Wales.</p>
        <p>It is the pale serenity of it all that I imagine -- pale with early sunshine, pale with snowlight from the mountains all around, pale from the glimmering lake, pale with the calm kind efficiency of a classically Swiss hotel. My room, of course, is spotless. In a minute or two, there will be a soft knock on my door and an impeccable young person will tiptoe in to lay my breakfast on the balcony -- coffee, juice, muesli, bread fresh from the bakery and a bowl of cherry jam.</p>
        <p>Everything works, naturally, like clockwork. The Beau-Rivage is family-owned and faultlessly professional.</p>
        <p>As the waitress withdraws, I wait to hear the discreet thump-thump of the lake steamer which, like clockwork, too, passes several times a day in lordly navigation -- for me, the chief of all the delights of this delightful hotel.</p>
        <p>Listen, here it comes now! But no, it's only the farmer's pickup sloshing up our lane to prepare the cows for milking -- my signal, every morning, that it's time to get up and put the kettle on.</p>
        <p>Jan Morris's most recent book is ''A Writer's House in Wales.''</p>
