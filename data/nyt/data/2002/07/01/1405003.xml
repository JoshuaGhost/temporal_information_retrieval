        <p>Number of writers protest Borders bookstore chain market research program in which it charges publishers fees to be 'category captains' for each of 250 categories; fear sponsoring publishers will effectively control shelves at stores at expense of others, promoting own books over those from smaller publishers; publishers and Borders say fees cover only cost of exit polls and customer surveys and offer publishers no other edge but closer look at data; photo (M)</p>

        <p>This summer the bookstore chain Borders is starting a program to apply the market research techniques of the grocery store business to the sales of novels and nonfiction books. One of its first lessons may be that comparing books to frozen foods is a sure way to raise the ire of authors, regardless of the details.</p>
        <p>Last week, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky and 26 other authors signed a letter to the chairman of Borders, Gregory P. Josefowicz, arguing that the new program, called category management, would hurt small publishers and narrow the stores' selection. Their main gripe was that Borders invited publishers -- for fees that can reportedly run more than $100,000 -- to be ''category captains'' for each of 250 categories, from cookbooks to thrillers.</p>

        <p>This summer the bookstore chain Borders is starting a program to apply the market research techniques of the grocery store business to the sales of novels and nonfiction books. One of its first lessons may be that comparing books to frozen foods is a sure way to raise the ire of authors, regardless of the details.</p>
        <p>Last week, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky and 26 other authors signed a letter to the chairman of Borders, Gregory P. Josefowicz, arguing that the new program, called category management, would hurt small publishers and narrow the stores' selection. Their main gripe was that Borders invited publishers -- for fees that can reportedly run more than $100,000 -- to be ''category captains'' for each of 250 categories, from cookbooks to thrillers.</p>
        <p>Learning of the program, Mr. Nader and the authors began to fear that the sponsoring publishers would effectively control the shelves at the stores at the expense of others, promoting their own books over those from smaller publishers and reducing the variety of titles sold.</p>
        <p>''There is a difference between books and Pop-Tarts,'' the letter warned. ''Leave the category management to the soap merchants.''</p>
        <p>But publishers familiar with the program and Michael G. Spinozzi, the executive vice president of Borders, said the truth was less sinister. The subsidies cover only the cost of exit polls and customer surveys.</p>
        <p>For its money, the publisher ''captain'' gets a closer look at the data before a summary of conclusions is shared with the rest of the industry. But it gains no other advantage. ''At no point in the process does a publisher get involved in the process of deciding what books we carry or where they are positioned,'' Mr. Spinozzi said.</p>
        <p>In cookbooks, for example, the results offer no insights at all about specific books. Instead, Borders and HarperCollins, the category's first sponsor, learned that consumers would prefer to see more books arranged by chef instead of by subject, he said. (Publishers do pay fees to bookstores to have their books promoted on prominent tables or in store advertisements, but that is a longstanding and unrelated practice.)</p>
        <p>Gary Ruskin, who helped organize the authors' letter, conceded that fears of publisher control might have been overblown. But even so, he said, too much market research was dangerous because it might lead to discrimination against different or unpopular books. ''It's all right for chicken cutlets, but this is all about the dissemination of ideas,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But some detected literary snobbery in the letter to Mr. Josefowicz, a former executive of a grocery store chain.</p>
        <p>''I think that is pretty snooty,'' said Peter Osnos, publisher of PublicAffairs, part of the Perseus Books Group. ''There is only one way we can go on functioning -- we have got to sell some books, and if this initiative works I am all for it.''</p>
