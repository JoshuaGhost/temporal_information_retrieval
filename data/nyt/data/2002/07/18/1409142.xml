        <p>A veteran House committee chairman indicated a willingness today to consider a compromise that would allow the Coast Guard to be moved to the proposed Department of Homeland Security.</p>
        <p>The congressman, Don Young, an Alaska Republican who heads the House Transportation Committee, had opposed such a transfer. Mr. Young, like other maritime representatives, has expressed concern that the Coast Guard's traditional search-and-rescue mission would be reduced.</p>
        <p>But today, at a hearing of a special House committee managing creation of the new department, Mr. Young said he might not oppose the move if the Coast Guard reported to its own under secretary in the department, and if the law was clear about the Coast Guard's mission.</p>
        <p>''It has to be written in the law that its mission will not change or be diminished,'' Mr. Young said.</p>
        <p>He did not promise to drop his opposition, but Republican officials said the compromise was likely to be written into the bill that would be presented to the House next week.</p>
        <p>The Coast Guard issue is among disputes that have threatened to delay creation of the department. Several House committees have passed amendments that would change President Bush's plan in substantial ways, including leaving out the Secret Service, parts of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
        <p>Today several Republican chairmen of those committees, along with their ranking Democrats, told the special committee, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, why they supported the changes to the Bush plan. But in many cases, the chairmen seemed resigned to the possibility that the committee -- dominated by the House Republican leadership -- would probably overrule them and restore much of the administration's plan.</p>
        <p>Officials of the various committees said they expected the panel to include the Secret Service and FEMA in the new department, actions that have been urged by the Bush administration. In addition, officials said the Republican plan would probably move the entire immigration service to the department, but would separate its enforcement and immigration services functions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young and the ranking Democratic member of his committee, Representative James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, said they still opposed moving the emergency management agency.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the Appropriations Committee urged the special committee not to accede to the administration's demand that it be able to move money among the department's divisions without Congressional approval, and be able to sell assets of the department and spend the money as the department sees fit.</p>
        <p>Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, read from the Constitution to remind House leaders that the legislative branch has sole discretion to appropriate money. Allowing the administration such flexibility, he said, would undermine the separation of government powers.</p>
        <p>Republican officials were working on a compromise that might give such flexibility to the department only in its first year or so.</p>
        <p>The detailed language to be recommended by the House leadership on the special committee is scheduled to be available on Thursday, and the committee will vote on the bill on Friday or Saturday. The matter will be taken to the House next week.</p>
