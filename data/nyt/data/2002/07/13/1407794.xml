        <p>Only about 2,000 of the estimated 2,823 people killed in the World Trade Center terrorist attack are likely to be identified through their remains, scientists at the New York City medical examiner's office said yesterday.</p>
        <p>There will probably not be enough DNA to clearly identify the remaining victims, said Dr. Robert Shaler, the director of forensic biology for the chief medical examiner's office.</p>
        <p>So far, the remains of 1,229 people, or 44 percent of those thought to have died, have been identified through laboratory analysis and other methods. Over 500 have been identified through DNA alone.</p>
        <p>The effort to identify remains is likely to last at least until the end of the year, and the final count is still not clear. Until now, city officials have not offered an estimate of how many they expect to identify, perhaps so as not to upset relatives of those whose remains have not been found or identified.</p>
        <p>''I'll be disappointed if we have fewer than that,'' Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the city's chief medical examiner, said of the estimate of 2,000 identified remains.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of people who are gone without a trace,'' he added. ''Also, a number of samples are degraded, and it's unclear whether we can coax enough material from them to make meaningful comparisons.''</p>
        <p>The DNA in remains found at ground zero or at the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island are matched against samples provided by the victims' families from toothbrushes, hairbrushes and other personal articles.</p>
        <p>Some families had to provide a second round of tissue samples, in a process that many found painful.</p>
        <p>Some victims were identified through traditional medical methods, such as teeth and fingerprints, or even personal effects found with the bodies.</p>
        <p>Altogether, thousands of body parts have been recovered and brought to the medical examiner's office, where the forensic work -- believed to be the largest in United States history -- is carried out.</p>
        <p>At the World Trade Center site, the recovery of remains continued until last month, when the last building debris was cleared. On Monday, at Fresh Kills, a ceremony will be held to conclude the sifting of the rubble.</p>
