        <p>Robert Arnold has spent much of his young life on boats. He started sailing at an early age, and knew boat safety like the back of his hand, always insisting on life vests for his passengers, his sailing coach said.</p>
        <p>But the authorities investigating a boat crash that left two people missing in Little Neck Bay in Queens on Thursday night describe a very different young man -- one who sped across the bay in his father's boat while under the influence of alcohol, turning fast circles in the water for kicks with a group of friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnold, 18, was arraigned last night in Queens County Court on three counts of boating while intoxicated after a powerboat he was driving slammed into another boat, sending people on both vessels into Little Neck Bay. Two men are missing in the murky waters and a woman is in critical condition at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said they intend to present the case to a grand jury. Mr. Arnold was released on $2,500 bail.</p>
        <p>In Douglas Manor, an affluent peninsula in Queens filled with elegant Tudor- and Victorian-style single-family homes, there was shock that a son of this upper-middle-class community could have been boating while drunk.</p>
        <p>''It is so out of character to say that Robert would do something this reckless,'' said Joyce Ramirez, who knew Mr. Arnold from the Douglaston Junior Yacht Squadron, where she is junior sailing adviser. ''Robert would never let anybody ride in his boat without a certified life jacket.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnold's boat, an 18-foot fiberglass Sea Ray powerboat, struck a 19-foot Bayliner with such force that it knocked the pilot off and sent the boat flying 50 feet across the water, law enforcement officials said. The pilot, John Kondogianis, 35, has not been found. His companion, Marisa Rodgers, 29, was rescued and taken to North Shore University Hospital with head injuries. On Friday, Ms. Rodgers remained in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Also missing is George Lawrence, 17, who was knocked off Mr. Arnold's boat in the crash. Four other teenagers were on that boat: Angelo Scandaliato, Andrew Khoury and Michael Caruso, all 18 years old and uninjured; and Kevin Burke, who was taken to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, the police said. His injuries were not life-threatening, they said.</p>
        <p>A police officer who interviewed Mr. Arnold after the crash smelled alcohol on his breath, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Arnold refused a Breathalyzer test, and four hours after the 9:50 p.m. crash, officials got a court order for a blood-alcohol test. Results of the test were not available yesterday.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said Mr. Arnold could face additional charges, including criminally negligent homicide and reckless manslaughter, if the two missing men are found dead. The charges of operating a vessel while impaired or intoxicated each carry a possible sentence of 90 days in jail and a $500 fine, said Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>After the arraignment, Craig Arnold, Mr. Arnold's father, said, ''He's very sorry for the accident.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnold's attorney, Steven R. Barnwell, of Uniondale, said, ''On behalf of the Arnold family, we want to express our deepest and most sincere condolences. Robert is remorseful that this accident occurred, he's sorry for the victims.''</p>
        <p>Since Thursday night, the Coast Guard has been searching from the Whitestone Bridge to Little Neck Bay.</p>
        <p>''At this point we are in a search mode,'' said Petty Officer Frank Bari, a Coast Guard spokesman. ''The Coast Guard's mission is to save lives, so we are going to continue to do what we can to find these people.''</p>
        <p>A helicopter dispatched from the Coast Guard's Atlantic City base hovered over the water and a New York Police Department harbor patrol boat skimmed the bay. At the Bayside Marina, where Mr. Kondogianis kept his boat, friends and families of the people who were hurt and missing came and went all day, hoping for news.</p>
        <p>In Douglas Manor, teenagers who know the group of friends on the boat gathered in an impromptu vigil to pray for the safe return of both men.</p>
        <p>''We are just waiting for news,'' Mrs. Ramirez said. ''We are a tight-knit community and we support each other. Everyone is standing behind Robert. We feel he will be exonerated.''</p>
        <p>At the neighborhood dock, eight friends of Mr. Lawrence's stared at the shimmering water as the sun set, keeping a silent vigil for him, too distraught to speak with a reporter.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday morning, Justin Dambinskas, 49, who docks his boat near Mr. Kondogianis' vessel, described him as a careful boater.</p>
