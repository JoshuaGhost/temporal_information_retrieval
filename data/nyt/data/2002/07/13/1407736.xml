      <block class="full_text">
        <p>THREE responses to the charges and arrest warrant issued Thursday by the district attorney in Philadelphia against Allen Iverson, the 6-foot-1 sensational scoring ace of the 76ers, the self-proclaimed ''Answer'' and the steadfast icon of hip-hop and counterculture, were particularly significant.</p>
        <p>To the three felony charges -- criminal trespassing, carrying an unlicensed gun and criminal conspiracy -- and to the six misdemeanor counts, including assault and false imprisonment, Iverson's coach, Larry Brown, said, ''I'm hopeful this thing gets resolved and this kid can move on with his life.''</p>
        <p>The Reebok company issued this statement after the charges: ''It is Allen's celebrity status, not the facts, that continues to fuel these proceedings. We firmly believe that Allen will be vindicated and Reebok, along with his millions of fans, will be standing by him when he is.''</p>
        <p>Oh, and millions of dollars. Reebok has a $50 million sneaker deal with Iverson.</p>
        <p>Lynne Abraham, the Philadelphia district attorney, said, ''I don't expect that Mr. Iverson is going to be treated any differently than anybody else charged with the same offenses, irrespective of their economic situations.''</p>
        <p>Regarding Brown's remark, the notion that Iverson, 27, who is the father of a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son and is earning $12 million a year from the 76ers, is a kid is repellent. Brown may have used the word as an affectionate term for a member of, as he went on to say, the 76ers family. More likely, that is how Brown, among others, understandably perceives him.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem with Iverson over the years is that he has indeed failed to grow up. There is, to be sure, no intention here to prejudge this most recent case, because in the eyes of the law, Iverson, the citizen, deserves to be considered innocent until proved guilty.</p>
        <p>But it is the accumulation of events that indicates a lack of maturity or growth. To name a few, there was a prison sentence when he was 17 for being in the forefront of a brawl in a bowling alley and hitting a woman over the head with a chair; a few years later, Iverson pleaded no contest to a concealed weapons charge; and there was his thug-rap album bashing women and gays last year. And, of course, there were the numerous fines by Brown over the last several years for coming late to practice or to shoot-arounds before games.</p>
        <p>Now come these charges, which the police said involved Iverson's barging into his cousin's West Philadelphia apartment last week with a gun in his waistband and shouting threats to two men while looking for his wife, Tawanna, after a domestic dispute.</p>
        <p>Reebok was swift to assert its support. It's not surprising that it would attempt to decide the case -- vindication is the key word -- before it went any further. After all, Iverson is a cash cow for the company. But it's another instance of commercial pandering. The kid, seemingly, can do no wrong. That's how brats are spoiled.</p>
        <p>When Abraham said Iverson would be treated like anyone else, she was being disingenuous, of course. The reality is that he will be treated quite differently, and has already.</p>
        <p>This acclaimed star athlete can uncommonly afford the best legal representation. And it is certain, based on other high-profile cases, that Iverson will be treated excessively in one of two ways: his celebrity will either make him a nice target to gain headlines for some ambitious prosecutors or politicians, or it will be helpful in getting him a kindlier consideration from authorities.</p>
        <p>In fact, Abraham conceded that the Iverson situation is different. ''This case for me as a prosecutor is, well, a little over the top,'' she said to a crowd of reporters. ''I have people murdered in the streets of Philadelphia and I don't see all of you here.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Iverson is home, his wife has returned, but he is not allowed to leave the premises until Tuesday, when he is scheduled to turn himself in to the police.</p>
        <p>The tragedy, whether Iverson is culpable in this instance or not, is that he continues to act like ''the kid.''</p>
        <p>One is reminded of the weird news conference Iverson held after last season and the 76ers' playoff flop, when speculation came from the team about trading him. Delinquent practice habits were a point of contention. But Iverson could not understand that such missteps negatively affect a team.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this current situation will make things clearer on many levels for Iverson. It is a terrible price to pay.</p>
