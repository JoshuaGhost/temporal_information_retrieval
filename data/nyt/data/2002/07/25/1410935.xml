        <p>While strike talk rages around them, negotiators for baseball's club owners and the players continue having talks they consider productive.</p>
        <p>They resumed negotiations yesterday and spent most of the two-hour session discussing revenue sharing, one of the major issues that have to be resolved for them to work out a new labor agreement.</p>
        <p>Michael Weiner, a union lawyer, said negotiators discussed the amount of money that would be transferred from high-revenue clubs to low-revenue clubs, how the money to be distributed would he divided between clubs' local revenue and the central fund, which clubs would give and get how much money and how that distribution would be determined. Under management's plan, $298 million would go from wealthier clubs to poorer clubs. The union's proposal would transfer $228 million. But the two sides differ on the formula under which the money would be distributed and the amount that would come from clubs' local revenue and the amount that would come from the central fund, which is the repository for revenue from the national television contract and licensing.</p>
        <p>The negotiators discussed two lesser issues as well -- the treatment of injured players and the funding of deferred compensation.</p>
        <p>They have additional meetings scheduled for today and tomorrow.</p>
