        <p>CRUISING 3,000 feet above the rocky Massachusetts coast in early July, Harlan Hamlin sat in the pilot's seat and complained about the weather. The sky was postcard blue, the sun was blazing, and not a whitecap could be seen in the Atlantic below.</p>

        <p>CRUISING 3,000 feet above the rocky Massachusetts coast in early July, Harlan Hamlin sat in the pilot's seat and complained about the weather. The sky was postcard blue, the sun was blazing, and not a whitecap could be seen in the Atlantic below.</p>
        <p>''When I go out on a demo flight now, I hope for bad weather,'' he said, pressing buttons on a small color monitor mounted in the dashboard of his single-engine 1966 Piper Comanche. The five-inch display, connected to a satellite receiver on the plane's roof, is capable of showing Mr. Hamlin any scrap of storminess over North America, from innocuous rain showers, represented on the screen in light green, to violent tornado activity, depicted in purple or white.</p>
        <p>But on this day, New England was weather-free. ''If there was anything to see, I'd see it,'' Mr. Hamlin said, hitting buttons until the map zoomed out and panned south to Tennessee, where a splotch of green and yellow (heavier rain) was ruining the morning for residents of Knoxville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamlin is a vice president at Satellink Technologies, the Virginia company that sells the new weather system, called Merlin, for $3,500 plus a monthly service fee. Merlin is part of a wave of new technologies making their way into the cockpits of private airplanes, some of which provide graphical information to which even commercial airline pilots and air traffic controllers lack access.</p>
        <p>Many of the new technologies improve safety by making navigation easier and supplying information about the location of bad weather, other airplanes, mountains and even the restricted zones over places like Camp David and national landmarks like the Statue of Liberty. But several of them -- like noise-reducing headsets, DVD players, MP3-based music systems and satellite phones -- simply make the experience of flying as a passenger in a small Cessna more like flying first-class on a big Boeing.</p>
        <p>This week, recreational pilots and airplane enthusiasts were gathering in Wisconsin for the 50th annual AirVenture Oshkosh show. It is the largest aviation event in North America, with more than 750,000 people typically attending and more than 700 exhibitors selling not only aircraft but also avionics, as electronic systems for the cockpit are known.</p>
        <p>''It's the mecca for pilots,'' Reed Prior says of the show, known to regular attendees simply as Oshkosh. Mr. Prior is a biotechnology executive who flies his twin-engine Cessna between homes in Massachusetts and Maryland, and has flown solo around the world. ''I used to go for the air show, but now I go for the exhibit booths, to see what the latest toys are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, in a cavernous hangar at the Hanscom Field airport just outside Boston, some of the gadgetry that Mr. Prior picked out at last year's Oshkosh show was being installed. The plane's pristine leather seats had been removed, and the cockpit's instrument panel had been disassembled. All that remained of the dashboard was a chaotic tangle of colored wires.</p>
        <p>John Hill, the avionics manager at East Coast Aviation, which sells and services aircraft, knelt in the cockpit of Mr. Prior's plane and explained that while aeronautical design and engine technology have remained relatively stagnant since the 1960's, microchips, color displays, sophisticated sensors and satellites for communications and global positioning are revolutionizing the cockpits of small planes. The devices enable pilots to visualize information just as PC-based spreadsheet software enabled managers to chart expenses.</p>
        <p>''People are bringing in planes that are 20 years old and upgrading the avionics packages to the tune of $30,000 to $60,000, instead of buying a new plane,'' Mr. Hill said. ''Last year, we probably did a total of 25 or 30 retrofits in older airplanes.''</p>
        <p>Most popular, Mr. Hill said, was the $20,000 SkyWatch system from Goodrich Avionics, which informs pilots of the location of nearby airplanes. Ordinarily, pilots find out where other planes are either by looking out the window or by having controllers alert them by radio. SkyWatch and similar systems show the altitude of other planes and whether they are climbing or descending. The systems can also audibly warn the pilot about traffic that poses a hazard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said that some of his customers were technophiles who spare no expense in outfitting their planes. (Rob Takecs, the avionics manager at Wiggins Airways, which sells and services aircraft in Manchester, N.H., told of one customer who requested that the three-screen entertainment system in his single-engine turboprop be a duplicate of his home theater system, complete with Bose surround-sound speakers.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Prior, who had ordered a new $12,000 high-resolution color display for his Cessna, agreed that ''there definitely is a keep-up-with-the-Joneses dynamic in the pilot community,'' but said that he and other pilots felt that improved safety justified the expenditures.</p>
        <p>''When you put your little pink body in that thing, you want to be sure you have all the information that's available,'' Mr. Prior said. ''Of course, very few spouses of pilots have very much of an idea of what their husbands are spending on these things. That's pretty much universal among all pilots.''</p>
        <p>At the other end of the price spectrum, some pilots are opting to use less-expensive consumer technology, like laptops and hand-held organizers. Phillip Apley, a computer scientist who has been flying for 15 years, regularly uses his Web-connected Palm VII in conjunction with a service called Enflight to get weather reports and file his flight plans.</p>
        <p>The service can warn Mr. Apley if weather conditions along the way exceed his preset personal limits. Others use laptops, running a special CD-ROM to display the approach charts that guide them into airports.</p>
        <p>Icarus Instruments, a small company in Takoma Park, Md., sells hardware and software that enables pilots to use a Compaq iPaq hand-held as an emergency backup for their primary instruments. Soon the company will offer an interface to the Merlin system, allowing pilots to see weather data on a $600 iPaq instead of a $12,000 panel-mounted display. (The huge price difference arises partly from the need to have the Federal Aviation Administration certify any instruments installed in the plane, as opposed to carry-on gear like iPaqs.)</p>
        <p>The new technology is not without pitfalls, however.</p>
        <p>While the F.A.A. dictates that pilots should use the new technology -- like instruments based on the global positioning system -- only as a supplement to traditional navigation techniques, many simply ''fly the line,'' guiding their craft along the magenta path the display paints for them to their destination.</p>
        <p>''There's a concern that some pilots have gotten too reliant'' on G.P.S., said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ''It's human nature -- you give someone a calculator, and they get bad at long division.''</p>
        <p>Like home PC buyers, many pilots at Oshkosh this week will browse the booths but ultimately put off a purchase, waiting for the new technology to get better, smaller or cheaper.</p>
        <p>''A number of people I know are waiting to see what happens next,'' Mr. Hamlin said. ''They're worried that they'll write a check and right after they do, the next great thing will come out.''</p>
