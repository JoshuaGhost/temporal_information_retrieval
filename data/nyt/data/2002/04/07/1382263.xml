        <p>Dorothy Conley letter argues that Tennessee University women's basketball team is just as good historically as NCAA championship Connecticut University women's team (S)</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Huskies are indeed a fine team; however, the idea that the number of their Final Four appearances is in any way remarkable is ludicrous. In comparison, 2002 was the 13th time Tennessee had been in the event. As for the Greatest Team in History, the 1997-98 Tennessee team also had a 39-0 record, and unlike Connecticut, it played the most difficult schedule in the country. I am a Connecticut native and a proud supporter of the Lady Vols. Huskies fans seldom know anything about the history of women's college basketball, but your sportswriters should.</p>
