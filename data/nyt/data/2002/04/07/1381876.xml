        <p>Cruising Britain's Canals</p>
        <p>Q. A friend and I would like to take a self-piloted narrowboat trip along canals in England this spring. Can you recommend some scenic routes and provide us with the names of boat rental companies? -- N. M. C., Newtown, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. Narrowboat excursions, popular in England since the 1960's, are an excellent way to see the British countryside at a leisurely pace, and there are now more than 300 companies renting the seven-foot-wide boats. Most narrowboats -- which can sleep up to 12, depending on length -- are less than five years old and have central heating, galleys and showers; some even have bathtubs, dishwashers, CD players and TV.</p>

        <p>Cruising Britain's Canals</p>
        <p>Q. A friend and I would like to take a self-piloted narrowboat trip along canals in England this spring. Can you recommend some scenic routes and provide us with the names of boat rental companies? -- N. M. C., Newtown, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. Narrowboat excursions, popular in England since the 1960's, are an excellent way to see the British countryside at a leisurely pace, and there are now more than 300 companies renting the seven-foot-wide boats. Most narrowboats -- which can sleep up to 12, depending on length -- are less than five years old and have central heating, galleys and showers; some even have bathtubs, dishwashers, CD players and TV.</p>
        <p>Generally, you can cover 80 to 100 miles in a week, at a relaxing 4 miles an hour (the speed limit), with ample time for stops along the way. A narrowboat for two can cost as little as $500 a week in low season, $2,140 in August. Most boats are hired for a week or longer, though weekend trips (Friday to Monday) are possible in spring and fall. Britain's 200-year-old canal system covers more than 2,000 miles.</p>
        <p>Philip Smith, trade relations manager of the British Tourist Authority in London and a director of Waterway Holidays UK, a consortium of waterway operators, says he regards May, June and September as the best time to be on the canals because that is when they are not so crowded and good weather is most likely. Instructions on the running the boat are given by the operator.</p>
        <p>For dramatic scenery, Mr. Smith suggests the Caledonian Canal in Loch Ness, Scotland, with views of snowcapped mountains and peat-lined locks of the Great Glen. For rural countryside, he recommends a canal in the heart of England like the Worcester-Birmingham Canal. The Kennet and Avon Canal offers rolling downs and picturesque villages, while the Leeds Liverpool Canal passes by old mills and warehouses.</p>
        <p>The British Tourist Authority's site about British waterways is www.waterwayholidaysuk.com. It includes 80 operators, maps, descriptions of canals, sights and lock information. A new free brochure, Waterway Holidays UK, with essentially the same information, may be ordered from the British Tourist Authority, 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10176; (877) 899-8391.</p>
        <p>Biking in Japan</p>
        <p>Q. My husband and I would like to go on a bicycle trip in Japan in late spring or early summer for two to three weeks. Are there companies that arrange and guide such trips?</p>
        <p>-- Waltraut Buser, Wall, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Japan offers lovely rural terrain for biking, though not many companies offer trips there because of the cost of travel in Japan compared with countries in Southeast Asia. If you can revise your departure dates, 13-year-old Cyclevents, offers an 11-day trip April 15 and Oct. 7 this year and on roughly the same dates next year -- the best time to see the flowers and foliage and avoid the heat of summer, says the owner, Tom Sheehan. He says the ride is geared to intermediate or better riders, with somewhat hilly terrain in the central part of the island, and focuses on feudal Japan, from the lovely mountain town Takayama, to the ancient temple city of Nikko. The price is $2,750 a person double occupancy, and includes breakfast and dinner, lodging in traditional minshuku (similar to B &amp; B's) and guides, but not air fare. Information: (888) 733-9615; www.cyclevents.com.</p>
        <p>Backroads, in business for 23 years, offers a six-day trip, at a higher price. Although this year the trip is scheduled for Sept. 30 and Oct. 7, next year there are April 21 and May 5 and 12 departures. The tour focuses on scenic rides along the coast of the Noto Peninsula, with its fishing villages, terraced rice fields and limestone formations. Skye Livingston, Backroads' trip development coordinator, describes the trip as moderately easy to challenging, with the latter sections optional. There are two support vehicles for those wishing to forgo the last stretch of the day's ride. The higher price of this trip reflects the high-end ryokan the company uses, and the elaborate meals they serve. Activities include walking tours, tea ceremonies and visits to open-air markets and gardens. The cost is $4,198 a person in double occupancy (including all but two meals) plus bike rental ($140). Air fare is not included; (800) 462-2848; www.backroads.com.</p>
        <p>If you wish to stick with your late spring or early summer plan, your best bet might be a customized trip. Velo Asia, 10 years old, (415) 282-3788, www.veloasia.com, designs bike tours and makes all arrangements, including air fares, lodging and guides. The price for Japan tours is $275 to $380 per person per day, depending on lodging, including bikes, ground transportation, guides and all but two meals. Last year Velo Asia arranged an 18-day trip for two couples on Shikoku Island, the Kyoto area and the Japanese Alps (Takayama region). Patrick Morris, the owner-director, says that the trip is of medium difficulty and there is always a support vehicle available. A sample two-week trip is outlined at www.veloasia.com/kyoto_itinerary.html.</p>
        <p>Visiting Rome's Gardens</p>
        <p>Q. Can you tell me when these gardens in Rome are open: Villa Farnesina, Villa Medici, Orti Farnesiani and Quirinal. We are planning a June trip. -- J. F., Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>A. The Villa Medici gardens cover 17 acres on the Pincio Hill above the Piazza di Spagna and offer sweeping views of the city. The gardens, with tree-lined avenues, statues and fountains, are open year-round on Saturday and Sunday morning from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Tours are held at 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. for $5.45; (39-06) 67611.</p>
        <p>The Orti Farnesiani (Farnese Gardens), in the Palatine, are on the site of one of the world's first botanical gardens, dating from the 17th century, and have pavilions, terraces, rose gardens and magnificent views of the Forum and beyond. Except for some areas now off limits for excavation and reconstruction work, the gardens are open year round 9 a.m. to one hour before sunset. Admission is $7 (includes entry to the Colosseum). Ticket kiosks are at 30 Via di San Gregorio and next to the Arch of Titus. A tour in English of the Palatine and garden at 10:30 a.m. costs $3 extra; (39-06) 399 67700.</p>
        <p>If you are planning to be in Rome on June 2, you are in luck. The gardens of the Quirinal, now the official residence of the president of Italy, are open only on that day this year, from 3 p.m. until sunset, in honor of the anniversary of the proclamation of the republic. Unfortunately, the garden at the Villa Farnesina, on Via della Lungara, is not open to the public.</p>
