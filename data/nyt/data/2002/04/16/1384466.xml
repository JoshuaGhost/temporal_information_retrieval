        <p>Analysis by researchers at Manchester Metropolitan University, in report in British Journal of Sports Medicine, concludes that runners-up in 800-meter and 5,000-meter races at 1998 Summer Olympics, though swifter, covered more ground than gold-medal winners who stayed closer to inside of track on curves; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>A group that analyzed the paths taken by two favorites who came in second in the 1998 Summer Olympics found that the runners-up had covered more ground than the gold-medal winners, who had stayed closer to the inside of the track on curves, according to a report in The British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p>

        <p>A group that analyzed the paths taken by two favorites who came in second in the 1998 Summer Olympics found that the runners-up had covered more ground than the gold-medal winners, who had stayed closer to the inside of the track on curves, according to a report in The British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p>
        <p>The group, led by Dr. Andrew M. Jones of Manchester Metropolitan University, examined the 800-meter and 5,000-meter races in Sydney.</p>
        <p>Runners sometimes swing to the outside on curves, Dr. Jones wrote, ''to ensure that they are well situated in case of a fast break by a competitor.''</p>
        <p>But that strategy's result in these races was that the faster runner lost because he ran farther: in the 800 meters, the winner covered 802 meters; the loser, 813. In each race, the favorite would have won if the distances had been equal.</p>
        <p>Athletes tend to think that before a race the distance is fixed and the energy each runner has available is variable, Dr. Jones said, when in fact it may be the other way around.</p>
