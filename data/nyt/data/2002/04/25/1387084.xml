        <p>The world's largest maker of luxury goods, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, said that sales grew 8 percent in the first quarter, compared with the period one year earlier, helped by demand for Champagne, fashion products and leather goods. Sales in the fashion and leather goods division increased 22 percent, to 1.1 billion euros ($978 million), and sales in the wines and spirits division increased 10 percent, to 457 million euros. In January this year, LVMH reported a 20 percent decline in operating income for 2001, which it attributed to the Sept. 11 attacks and the subsequent decline in tourism. LVMH relies heavily on its own retail stores, like the Sephora cosmetics chain; such stores cater heavily to travelers.</p>
