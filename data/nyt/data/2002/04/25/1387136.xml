        <p>A 21-year-old construction worker was arrested yesterday and charged with killing his foreman with a pickax during an argument over $700 in back pay, the authorities said. The police questioned the man, Oskar Racins, a laborer, after, they said, he missed a plane flight to Latvia and returned to his father's Brooklyn apartment. Mr. Racins was later arrested. The body of the foreman, Donald Peglow, 45, was found at 7 a.m. Tuesday at a construction site on Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Racins, who was born in Latvia, had apparently planned to flee to Riga, Latvia, later that day, and had bought a ticket on Finnair, the police said. But he fell asleep at the airport waiting to board, they said. Mr. Racins was charged with murder and robbery, said Lt. Gerald Lopez, commander of the First Precinct Detective Squad, which investigated the killing.</p>
