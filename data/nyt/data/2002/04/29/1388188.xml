        <p>Editorial says AOL Time Warner's big bet on its merger has not yet paid off, and company has declared record quarterly loss and seen its share price plummet; says perhaps company should stop emphasizing synergy and instead focus on making each of its individual business units as profitable as possible, by making them best in their areas</p>

        <p>When Richard Parsons, AOL Time Warner's incoming C.E.O., spoke to a roomful of Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth business school students last week, he made a joking plea. ''I'm desperately in need of a strategy,'' he told his youthful audience. One group that is not laughing at Mr. Parsons' wry remark is AOL shareholders, who have been forced to look on glumly as management reported a $54.2 billion quarterly loss last week, the largest in United States history, and as the stock has plummeted nearly 40 percent since January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons, who officially moves up to his new post next month, is taking the helm of a company built around a big bet that has not yet paid off. In January 2000, when the merger of America Online and Time Warner was first announced, the two companies declared that they were building a new kind of media company for a new age. The fast-growing AOL was going to be the growth engine of the new entity, carrying Time Warner's stodgy old media divisions along with it. The biggest upside from the deal would be the synergy that would result as AOL's Internet service and Time Warner's cable, movie, music and print businesses cross-promoted each other, making the sum of the two companies far greater than their parts.</p>

        <p>When Richard Parsons, AOL Time Warner's incoming C.E.O., spoke to a roomful of Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth business school students last week, he made a joking plea. ''I'm desperately in need of a strategy,'' he told his youthful audience. One group that is not laughing at Mr. Parsons' wry remark is AOL shareholders, who have been forced to look on glumly as management reported a $54.2 billion quarterly loss last week, the largest in United States history, and as the stock has plummeted nearly 40 percent since January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parsons, who officially moves up to his new post next month, is taking the helm of a company built around a big bet that has not yet paid off. In January 2000, when the merger of America Online and Time Warner was first announced, the two companies declared that they were building a new kind of media company for a new age. The fast-growing AOL was going to be the growth engine of the new entity, carrying Time Warner's stodgy old media divisions along with it. The biggest upside from the deal would be the synergy that would result as AOL's Internet service and Time Warner's cable, movie, music and print businesses cross-promoted each other, making the sum of the two companies far greater than their parts.</p>
        <p>That is not how things have worked out. America Online is sputtering. New subscriptions have slowed, and advertising and e-commerce revenue, which soared 103 percent in the boom year of 1999, declined in the fourth quarter of 2001. That's not surprising, given the tough economy, but it complicates a business model predicated on AOL's moving ever upward. High-speed Internet access, widely touted as key to the company's future, has had a low-speed rollout. For all the talk about the power of the new economy, what has kept the company growing is the performance of old-economy units like Time Inc. magazines and Warner Brothers movies.</p>
        <p>Synergy appears, similarly, to have been oversold. AOL Time Warner can boast of some success, including selling magazine subscriptions and promoting movies on AOL. But the bolder vision of cross-promotion by all the company's divisions has not been realized. As a matter of free-market competition and journalistic ethics, that's a good thing. Time Warner Cable insists that it is not favoring AOL Time Warner content, and the company's magazine editors take offense if anyone suggests that they are giving preferential coverage to AOL Time Warner movies and books.</p>
        <p>Righting AOL Time Warner is a daunting task, particularly in these hard economic times, which have taken a toll on large media companies. A lawyer and onetime banker, the personable Mr. Parsons is in his element lobbying regulators and charming potential corporate partners. But now he needs to show that he has the skills, and the vision, to build a media company for the 21st century. Mr. Parsons will have help from the company's chairman, Stephen Case, founder of AOL, and Robert Pittman, the AOL Time Warner chief operating officer, who has long experience in traditional media. But it will fall to Mr. Parsons to inspire Wall Street, which recently drove the stock below $20, AOL's worst showing since 1998.</p>
        <p>The Ivy League business school students Mr. Parsons spoke to last week were participants in a contest, sponsored by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, to come up with the best strategy for AOL Time Warner. The four-woman team from Harvard, which took home the tidy $20,000 prize, recommended that the company stop emphasizing synergy and instead focus on making each of its individual business units as profitable as possible, by making them the best in their areas.</p>
        <p>That would mean abandoning one of the key articles of faith behind the merger. Whether it is that idea or something better, if Mr. Parsons and his colleagues want to win over the skeptics on Wall Street and across the country, they will have to articulate a clear vision for how they intend to revive this struggling behemoth -- and then make it happen.</p>
