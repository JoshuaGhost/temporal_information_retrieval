        <p>CAPTAINS of industry like to blame Hollywood screenwriters for their image problems. When a movie or a television show needs a villain who is not a drug lord, terrorist or psychopath, the standard candidate is a venal, wealthy capitalist; although not, of course, a venal capitalist who got wealthy by selling movies or TV shows.</p>
        <p>No, the villain is more like the kind of capitalists who operate in Manhattan, which may be Californians' way of insulting New York. But even if that's their intention, we can't blame them for creating this evil image in popular culture. We started blackening our own image long before there was a Hollywood, as you can see in an exhibition opening today at the New-York Historical Society.</p>

        <p>CAPTAINS of industry like to blame Hollywood screenwriters for their image problems. When a movie or a television show needs a villain who is not a drug lord, terrorist or psychopath, the standard candidate is a venal, wealthy capitalist; although not, of course, a venal capitalist who got wealthy by selling movies or TV shows.</p>
        <p>No, the villain is more like the kind of capitalists who operate in Manhattan, which may be Californians' way of insulting New York. But even if that's their intention, we can't blame them for creating this evil image in popular culture. We started blackening our own image long before there was a Hollywood, as you can see in an exhibition opening today at the New-York Historical Society.</p>
        <p>The exhibition features board games manufactured in 19th-century New York, then the national capital of mass entertainment and propaganda aimed at children. ''The game manufacturers promoted their products as educational amusements,'' said Ellen Liman, who collected the games along with her husband, Arthur, who died in 1997. When Mr. Liman, the prominent trial lawyer, wasn't busy trying to keep tycoons like Robert L. Vesco and Michael R. Milken out of jail, he was scouring flea markets for editions of ''The Checkered Game of Life'' or ''Bulls and Bears: The Great Wall Street Game.''</p>
        <p>The American board game industry began flourishing in New England in the 1840's with religious games like ''The Mansion of Happiness,'' in which the goal was to reach heaven. Landing on squares for ''Temperance'' or ''Sincerity'' moved you forward; landing on ''Audacity'' or ''Cruelty'' sent you backward.</p>
        <p>By the 1880's, the industry was centered in New York, notably at a Brooklyn firm, McLoughlin Brothers. In some of the most popular games of the era, saving your soul wasn't enough to win the game. As any New Yorker knew, you had to make money, too, although prosperity was still often linked with virtue.</p>
        <p>In ''The Game of Telegraph Boy or Merit Rewarded,'' a player became president of the telegraph company by avoiding the ''Loitering'' square and landing on ''Integrity'' or ''Accuracy.'' The cover of another game with a Horatio Alger theme, ''Cash,'' was emblazoned with a subtitle in large letters: ''Honesty Is the Best Policy.''</p>
        <p>MEANWHILE, a more cynical view of business was starting to emerge. The ''Bulls and Bears'' game from McLoughlin Brothers showed a sheep in the center of the board being sheared by a bull and a bear dressed in expensive clothes. In case anyone missed the lesson of what Wall Street speculators were doing to the public, the corners of the board were decorated with pictures of William Henry Vanderbilt and Jay Gould.</p>
        <p>McLoughlin Brothers also promoted ''Monopolist,'' another public-relations hit for capitalism. ''On this board,'' the company's 1885 catalog promised, ''the great struggle between Capital and Labor can be fought out to the satisfaction of all parties, and, if the players are successful, they can break the Monopolist and and become Monopolists themselves.''</p>
        <p>Later, an extreme version of this philosophy produced ''Monopoly,'' the 1935 game that has indoctrinated generations of children with the notion that a free market naturally degenerates into a permanent monopoly. The game industry is itself a refutation of the notion: the once-dominant McLoughlin Brothers disappeared long ago, and today's game market is a vicious battle among Hasbro, Mattel and the upstarts turning out whole new kinds of games on computers. But as long as players want to believe in evil capitalists, capitalists will be glad to sell them a game.</p>
