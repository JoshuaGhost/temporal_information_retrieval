        <p>Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown and player Allen Iverson feud in frustration after losing two games to Boston Celtics in Eastern Conference playoff series (M)</p>

        <p>The coach appeared worn down, fed up. The star player sounded unappreciated. Nothing changes. Their season on the ledge, Larry Brown and Allen Iverson went back and forth again today, locked in a two-man drill that could either ignite or implode the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
        <p>Brown, the 76ers' coach, and Iverson, the N.B.A.'s reigning most valuable player, met for five minutes today after practice, trying to smooth over their latest squabble after dropping the first two games of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series in Boston. Game 3 of the three-of-five-game series is Sunday in Philadelphia, where the 76ers are on the precipice of being swept by a much more cohesive crew.</p>

        <p>The coach appeared worn down, fed up. The star player sounded unappreciated. Nothing changes. Their season on the ledge, Larry Brown and Allen Iverson went back and forth again today, locked in a two-man drill that could either ignite or implode the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
        <p>Brown, the 76ers' coach, and Iverson, the N.B.A.'s reigning most valuable player, met for five minutes today after practice, trying to smooth over their latest squabble after dropping the first two games of their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series in Boston. Game 3 of the three-of-five-game series is Sunday in Philadelphia, where the 76ers are on the precipice of being swept by a much more cohesive crew.</p>
        <p>Iverson, in perhaps his longest interview with reporters this season, responded to a comment Brown made after Philadelphia's Game 2 loss on Thursday night. ''I think their star players are thinking about winning the game and not dominating the game,'' Brown said.</p>
        <p>The dig was clearly aimed at Iverson, who checked back into the game with 7 minutes 11 seconds remaining and with his team nursing a 4-point lead. The 76ers had just gone on a 14-2 run when he forced up two ill-advised shots. He scored only once more down the stretch, finishing with 29 points, and was 11 for 30 from the field in a 93-85 loss.</p>
        <p>Asked about Brown's comment today, Iverson replied: ''You have to ask him. I don't know why he would want to think that I don't want to win. I want to be dominant and I want to win. You should've asked him, did he feel like I want to win? Because he'll tell you I want to do both. And if he doesn't tell you I want to do both, then obviously the time he's been around me I didn't show him that. And I don't think that's the case.''</p>
        <p>Later, in a separate interview, Brown said, ''I think I'd rather have him say he wants to win and then dominate.'' He added: ''I have no problem with Allen. He got a problem with me, that's his problem.''</p>
        <p>Clarifying his comment after Game 2, Brown said, ''What I'm trying to say is, when you get to this point in the year, your stars got to win games.''</p>
        <p>The 76ers, the defending conference champions, are one loss from elimination, about to complete an odyssey that began with their top three players missing training camp because of injury. The 76ers went 43-39 this season and settled for the sixth seeding in the East. Iverson missed the last 14 games of the regular season with a broken left hand. He is shooting 15 of 45 in the series with 49 points.</p>
        <p>Iverson spoke for about 20 minutes and was more candid today than perhaps at any time this season, saying he did not feel like a franchise player, broaching the topic of being traded and adding that the negativity in the news media had much to do with what is wrong in the world.</p>
        <p>''I'm just not,'' he replied when asked why he did not feel like a franchise player. ''I know I'm not.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he could name one franchise player, Iverson said that reporters were making a big deal out of something that did not matter.</p>
        <p>''Don't try to make no big thing out of this because I said something and then you blow the whole thing up about a franchise player,'' he said. ''It's not about just me, it's about my team as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Of the possibility of being traded, he said: ''I've always said from Day 1 I want to be a Sixer and I want to remain a Sixer for the rest of my career. I'm not going to let anybody drive me out of here. But if people think me leaving is the best for this team, then make that decision and I won't feel bad about it. Because just put me in another N.B.A. uniform, and I'll try to do the same thing that I tried to do here, just play every game like it's my last. That should be enough, whatever team I go to.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he said he thought he knew where the turmoil on the 76ers -- and in the world -- had its genesis.</p>
        <p>''I think it comes from the pencils, the pens, the paper and the cameras,'' Iverson said, adding: ''One little comment about a franchise player, or Allen said this or Coach said that, it makes the whole world and the whole Philadelphia think there is some turmoil within this organization. Negativity is the thing that sells.''</p>
        <p>Iverson added: ''You know, that's why this world is messed up. That's why people fly airplanes into buildings, rape women and child-molest little kids. The world is so negative. Instead of talking about something good, you would rather put the bad stuff in there.</p>
        <p>''It's a negative world. You just try to fight off the negativity as much as you can. I've been here six years and these people been crushing me as long as I've been here. But every time I fall down, I get right back up.''</p>
