        <p>After a bargaining session that both sides described as productive, the head of the New York City teachers' union said yesterday that she thought a contract agreement with the city was imminent.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, the union president, said that the two sides had made progress ''both in substance and in tone,'' and that they had agreed to use recommendations made last week by a state panel as the framework for a settlement. The panel recommended that the city's 80,000 teachers, who have worked without a new contract since November 2000, receive a 15 percent raise over 27 months and work an extra 20 minutes a day.</p>

        <p>After a bargaining session that both sides described as productive, the head of the New York City teachers' union said yesterday that she thought a contract agreement with the city was imminent.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, the union president, said that the two sides had made progress ''both in substance and in tone,'' and that they had agreed to use recommendations made last week by a state panel as the framework for a settlement. The panel recommended that the city's 80,000 teachers, who have worked without a new contract since November 2000, receive a 15 percent raise over 27 months and work an extra 20 minutes a day.</p>
        <p>''We are not talking about all sorts of new demands or a whole new universe of issues,'' Ms. Weingarten said in a news conference after the meeting. ''So I feel cautiously optimistic that we can get this thing done quickly.''</p>
        <p>While Deputy Mayor Marc V. Shaw described the meeting as fruitful, several officials involved in the negotiations said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg still felt strongly that certain changes in work rules were needed to improve the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg has publicly advocated granting principals more power to assign teachers to specific classrooms and tasks, a change that would require a major concession from the union, the United Federation of Teachers. Mr. Bloomberg has also said that teachers should go back to patrolling lunchrooms, a duty that was eliminated in the last contract. School officials believe that teachers do a better job of keeping order during lunch than aides.</p>
        <p>Still, after a year and a half of relative impasse, Ms. Weingarten's almost cheerful tone conveyed new hope that the contract talks could soon be wrapped up. On Wednesday, Ms. Weingarten warned that the union's delegate assembly would vote on May 8 to authorize a strike if no deal had been reached. She said yesterday that the vote would still take place if the two sides had not settled by then, but sounded hopeful that the vote -- basically a scare tactic, since strikes are illegal -- would not be necessary.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Weingarten spoke glowingly of the Bloomberg administration after yesterday's talks, she aimed a dart at Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy and the Board of Education, suggesting that they were trying to complicate negotiations at the last minute. She dryly noted that Mr. Levy had sent two of his deputies and a number of school superintendents to the bargaining session, and suggested that they had threatened progress by reintroducing old demands.</p>
        <p>''All of these supposed 'other issues' are Board of Education issues,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''Part of the reason we are not as far along as we should be is that the Board of Education and the city of New York do not know how to work together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy, whose contract expires in June and who is trying to build a legacy for himself in what could be his final months on the job, said yesterday that both he and the mayor were still pushing for concessions.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in a long time I've seen real leadership and understanding from City Hall as to what needs to be fixed in the school system,'' Mr. Levy said. ''I share their view. The nature of collective bargaining is to reach settlements and we'll get there, but there are rule changes that need to be made.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Levy clearly hopes to add concessions on work rules to his list of accomplishments, it is somewhat less clear how long and hard the Bloomberg administration is willing to fight for such changes. Some officials say Mr. Bloomberg is eager to wrap up a teachers' contract in the next few weeks, the same time frame in which he hopes to reach a deal with Albany that hands him control of the school system. That way, the mayor could announce two major educational victories at once and demonstrate that he is making progress toward his top priority, fixing the public schools.</p>
        <p>A contract settlement is also contingent on a state budget agreement, because the city, facing a huge deficit, is depending heavily on Albany to provide money for teachers' raises.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten said that in her view, the biggest outstanding issues were how teachers should spend the extra 20 minutes a day recommended by the state panel and how to parcel out a $56 million recruitment pool that the panel suggested be spent on bonuses for new certified teachers.</p>
        <p>The union would rather split the money among all teachers with up to 10 years of experience, so that not just newcomers benefit.</p>
        <p>Between the $3,100 bonus and the 15 percent raise recommended by the panel, new teachers would earn about $40,000, up from $31,910.</p>
        <p>The two sides agreed yesterday to meet again on Wednesday. They also appointed committees of City Hall, Board of Education and union officials to try to work out their remaining differences.</p>
