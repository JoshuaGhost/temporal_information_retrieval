        <p>A bomb was found and defused on Friday at the entrance to a Jewish cemetery outside Strasbourg, in eastern France, police officials said.</p>

        <p>A bomb was found and defused today at the entrance to a Jewish cemetery outside Strasbourg, in eastern France, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The police also said today that at least eight people were being detained in connection with the firebombing of synagogues in two other French cities early Thursday.</p>
        <p>The police in Paris said that five people had been arrested in connection with a firebomb that was thrown at a synagogue in the southern Paris suburb of Le Kremlin-Bicêtre in the early hours of Thursday. The bomb landed on a sidewalk, causing little if any damage to the building.</p>
        <p>In Montpellier, in the south of France, the police said that three people suspected of hurling firebombs at a synagogue there later Thursday morning had confessed. They were expected to appear later today before prosecutors, in the French form of an arraignment.</p>
        <p>The apparent attempt to bomb the synagogue today was one more in a series of anti-Semitic attacks in recent weeks in France and elsewhere in Europe. In the past, anti-Semitic attacks have largely been linked to skinheads. But many analysts have linked the latest attacks to the bloodshed in the Middle East and to Arab anger at Israel and Jews.</p>
        <p>Strasbourg, though, has been plagued in recent years by outbursts of violence by skinhead gangs in the high-rise projects that ring the city. On most weekends, dozens of automobiles are set on fire by vandals.</p>
        <p>The police action appeared to reflect the urgency felt by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the face of complaints that there has not been enough public outcry over the anti-Semitic attacks.</p>
        <p>In Strasbourg, the police said the latest bomb, a crude device consisting of a fire extinguisher containing as much as 11 pounds of explosives, was found in a small prayer house whose doors were set ablaze over the Passover-Easter weekend, following an anti-Israel demonstration. It was one of three French synagogues set on fire over the weekend, including one in Marseille that was burned to the ground. The police said the bomb was discovered by a Jewish resident and defused by a bomb squad.</p>
        <p>In Lyon, judicial officials said a formal investigation was begun on charges of voluntary arson against at least a dozen men who, wearing masks, crashed two cars through the gates of the Synagogue de la Duchère over the weekend and set them on fire. None of the attackers have been identified, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Paris was bracing today for two large demonstrations, one scheduled for Saturday by groups supporting the Palestinians, the other set for Sunday, called by Jewish organizations to denounce anti-Semitism and to express solidarity with Israel.</p>
        <p>But Jewish ranks here were broken today when 21 prominent Jewish figures publicly denounced Israel's occupation of Palestinian cities in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>In an open letter titled ''Support Israel? Not in Our Name,'' that was published in the daily newspaper Le Monde, the authors, including Dr. Rony Brauman, a former president of Doctors Without Borders, wrote, referring to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, ''Ever since Sharon promised the Israelis security, their country has become the place where Jews are least safe in the world.''</p>
