        <p>The Israeli government, irritated today by protesters and foreign journalists who breached the siege around Yasir Arafat's compound, said reporters who remained in Ramallah could be stripped of their credentials or even have their offices closed down.</p>
        <p>The government is frustrated at foreign news coverage of the military operation in Ramallah, in the West Bank, and has declared the city a ''closed military zone,'' saying it is illegal for foreign reporters to be there.</p>
        <p>There was no indication that any news organization had any intention of withdrawing reporters from Ramallah as a result of the order.</p>
        <p>Today, a group of 40 international protesters suddenly walked past Israeli tanks and stunned soldiers and entered Mr. Arafat's compound. Several reporters were with the group, and a CNN reporter, Michael Holmes, subsequently broadcast both the group's feat and an interview with the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>Danny Seaman, the director of the Government Press Office, said one of the reasons for isolating Mr. Arafat was to prevent him from any contact with lieutenants in the field, so giving him an outlet ''provided him with the means of obstructing the goals of the Israeli operation.'' He also contended that when the reporters and some members of the group left the compound, 13 Palestinians wanted by Israel tried to come out with them. Mr. Seaman said they were captured.</p>
        <p>He also said the army was concerned about journalists' safety, and that having reporters around led soldiers to hesitate before shooting. That, Mr. Seaman said, could result in their being attacked.</p>
        <p>A Washington-based staff writer for The Boston Globe, Anthony Shadid, 33, was shot in the shoulder today while walking down a street in Ramallah. He was taken to a private Palestinian hospital, where he was reported in stable condition. It was not clear who fired the shot. Other reporters said there was no major fighting at the time in the area where Mr. Shadid was wounded.</p>
        <p>The ban on entering Ramallah was challenged by the Foreign Press Association, because under the Oslo agreements, Ramallah was placed under full Palestinian control. ''It's now under Israeli occupation,'' Mr. Seaman said.</p>
        <p>The Government Press Office also warned news organizations that it would enforce a prohibition on hiring Palestinians who did not have permits to work in Israel. He said an organization that did so would be subject to a stiff fine and even the closing of its office.</p>
        <p>The measure was apparently aimed at Palestinian journalists for foreign organizations who occasionally work in Israel, but without the work permits required of Palestinian laborers and without Israeli press accreditation. The order seemed to have been prompted by the government's irritation with television reports by the Palestinian journalists that severely assailed Israel's actions.</p>
        <p>Appearing on a call-in radio show late tonight, Mr. Seaman charged that Palestinians employed by foreign networks were ''no doubt employed by the Palestinian Authority.''</p>
        <p>''There is a war today between the Jewish people, the Israeli people, and the Palestinians,'' he said. ''They will use every method to hurt us, including exploiting the media and Israeli democracy. We have to put a stop to this matter.''</p>
