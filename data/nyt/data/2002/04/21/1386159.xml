        <p>Eric Hanson letter argues that New York Yankees fans should support slumping first baseman Jason Giambi instead of heckling him (S)</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I was appalled to read of Jason Giambi's hostile reception at Yankee Stadium. Surely, he could use fans' support, not their derision. Baseball is a game of slumps and streaks, and ''the most knowledgeable fans in the game,'' as Yankees fans often call themselves, should know that. Their behavior called to mind a spoiled brat unhappy with his new toy.</p>
