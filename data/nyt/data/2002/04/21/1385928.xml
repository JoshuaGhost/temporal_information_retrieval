        <p>HOUSING is on a roll just now, but the home mortgage market has been cruising for years. For the last quarter-century, the mortgage market has grown 40 percent faster than nominal gross domestic product. In 2001, mortgage debt grew by $580 billion, or 10.3 percent.</p>
        <p>All that activity has put smiles on the faces of borrowers and lenders, but investors, for the most part, have yawned: shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the behemoths of the business, have barely budged this year. Jonathan E. Gray, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, spoke last week about the industry. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>Q.  Can the housing boom be sustained?</p>
        <p>A.  The housing and mortgage market are on the verge of a multiyear period of rapid growth. Baby boomers who have been saving and investing are making housing improvements, buying second homes. Around the country, there is no inventory: currently only about three to four months in most of the big markets, compared to about seven or eight months historically.</p>
        <p>Q.  What differentiates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from others in the home mortgage business?</p>
        <p>A.  Fannie and Freddie have certain advantages over other participants that allow them to grow very rapidly. For example, because of the way they are regulated, they have half the capital requirements of banks and thrifts for loans on their balance sheets. Operating in the same market, that means Fannie and Freddie can earn twice the rate of return of banks and thrifts. After dividends, their capital grows very rapidly, at about 18 percent per year. And since they don't make loans, but buy them, they can grow as fast as their capital will permit.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is it likely that Congress, which created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will now change the way they operate?</p>
        <p>A.  Their presence in the mortgage market lowers mortgage rates by 25 basis points to 50 basis points [hundredths of a percentage point]. About half of all mortgages have Freddie's and Fannie's name on them, about $3 trillion. So you could argue they lower the cost of home ownership by $7.5 billion to $15 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Their political base is about a million Realtors, who are some of the biggest contributors to both parties, and the building trade. Fannie and Freddie have been too aggressive at times, contributing to the tension with vocal competitors like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, A.I.G. and General Electric. But my view is that Congress will continue to support Fannie and Freddie in their current roles, and that it will be years, if ever, that the scales tip against them.</p>
        <p>Q.  Have Fannie and Freddie been too aggressive?</p>
        <p>A.  They are not risky entities. First, Congress requires them to buy insurance on the riskiest loans. That is one reason why they can operate with so little capital, because they have so little risk. Their real loss rate is about two to three basis points, versus about 83 basis points for the banking industry last year. You need a microscope to see their loss rate.</p>
        <p>And their risk-based capital standards are such that they are supposed to be able to survive a nuclear-winter scenario that includes an environment where home prices fall 30 percent to 40 percent across the country and stay at that level for a decade.</p>
        <p>Q.  If you had to pick one stock over the other, which one would it be, and why?</p>
        <p>A.  Long term, Fannie and Freddie are the same story. Over the next five years, they are likely to grow earnings an average of 14 to 15 percent. Right now I have a slight preference for Freddie, because it is growing faster.</p>
        <p>Q.  Do you like other stocks in the group?</p>
        <p>A.  We are recommending almost all of the stocks I follow, and I own a lot of shares in these companies.</p>
        <p>If I were to pick a single name, it would be Washington Mutual, which is the second-cheapest stock in the S.&amp; P. 500 ahead of only Halliburton.</p>
        <p>It is valued as if its earnings were going to fall 5 to 10 percent a year for the next five years, when in fact its earnings are going to grow 10 percent or faster. It has a return on equity of 25 percent to 30 percent, which is higher than either Fannie or Freddie. The stock sells at about 8.5 times earnings.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason investors are afraid to own a savings and loan is fear the Fed is going to raise interest rates.</p>
        <p>We estimate that if the Fed raises rates by 1.25 percentage points, Washington Mutual will see earnings grow 10 percent this year and next. If they raised rates dramatically, by two to three percentage points, earnings growth would be cut to zero to down 5 percent for a year. In the last 10 years, there has been only one year where Washington Mutual saw its earnings decline. And it is so profitable, it has plenty of capital even after it pays a big dividend.</p>
