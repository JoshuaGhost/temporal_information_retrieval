        <p>It might be fortunate for former Deputy Mayor Hector Corchado that he left his post last month to run for a seat on the City Council in the May 14 municipal election.</p>
        <p>After all, Mayor Sharpe James said that he would dismiss any member of his staff seen in a Newark strip club where 31 people were arrested on prostitution-related charges last month. (Never mind that it later came out that the mayor had also paid a visit.)</p>

        <p>It might be fortunate for former Deputy Mayor Hector Corchado that he left his post last month to run for a seat on the City Council in the May 14 municipal election.</p>
        <p>After all, Mayor Sharpe James said that he would dismiss any member of his staff seen in a Newark strip club where 31 people were arrested on prostitution-related charges last month. (Never mind that it later came out that the mayor had also paid a visit.)</p>
        <p>Moses Wilson Jr., the owner of the club, Sights, and the head of security there, Tyrone Leak, said Mr. Corchado had been to the club at least a half-dozen times until late last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corchado, who has been on a leave of absence from the mayor's office since last month, did not respond to repeated messages left at his home and campaign headquarters.</p>
        <p>The club must have been a pretty popular place. Jermaine James, an aide to Councilman Cory Booker -- who is opposing Mr. James for mayor -- was questioned by the police outside the club during a raid on March 24, though he was not charged.</p>
