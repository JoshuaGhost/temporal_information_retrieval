        <p>Working With Words  His credits include songs like ''Ain't Misbehavin','' ''Honeysuckle Rose,'' ''Black and Blue'' and ''Stompin' at the Savoy,'' but few people are familiar with the lyricist Andy Razaf (1895-1973). Performers like Bobby Short, Keith Byron Kirk and Anika Noni Rose try to rectify this situation at 8 and 10 on Saturday night in ''The Lyrics of Andy Razaf,'' the concluding performance of the fourth season of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series, in the Stanley H. Kaplan penthouse at 165 West 65th Street.</p>
        <p>Lone Eagle II  A Lindbergh will be at the controls of the single-engine plane. The destination of his nonstop trans-Atlantic flight is Le Bourget Airport outside Paris. But 75 years have passed since Charles Lindbergh's history-making flight in the Spirit of St. Louis. This time the pilot will be Erik Lindbergh, his 36-year-old grandson, and the plane will be the New Spirit of St. Louis. In a celebration of the 1927 flight that will be addressed in ''Lindbergh Flies Again,'' a History Channel broadcast on May 20, and in an effort to encourage private space travel, Mr. Lindbergh is to take off from Lindbergh Field in San Diego on Sunday and follow his grandfather's flight plan to St. Louis and New York before lifting off for France on May 1.</p>

        <p>Accolades  ''The Complete Works of Isaac Babel,'' edited by Nathalie Babel, his daughter, will receive the prize for fiction when the fourth annual Koret Jewish Book Awards are presented on Monday. A special award for literature will recognize W. G. Sebald, the German novelist who died in December. Other winners are Eli Lederhendler, ''New York Jews and the Decline of Urban Ethnicity -- 1950-1970,'' for history; Dorothy Gallagher, ''How I Came Into My Inheritance and Other True Stories,'' for biography, autobiography and literary studies; and Samuel C. Heilman, ''When a Jew Dies: The Ethnography of a Bereaved Son,'' and Ken Koltun-Fromm, ''Moses Hess and Modern Jewish Identity'' for philosophy and thought.</p>
        <p>In the Beginning  In 1925 the young show business team of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart began a 24-year partnership with their first successful Broadway musical, ''Dearest Enemy,'' with a book by Herbert Fields based on a Revolutionary War legend of a long lunch that saved an army. At 8 p.m. Saturday, in conjunction with the Richard Rodgers Centennial Celebration, the Village Light Opera Group will revive ''Dearest Enemy,'' with a cast of 50 and a 25-piece orchestra. Six shows are scheduled through April 21 at the Fashion Institute of Technology's Haft Auditorium, 227 West 27th Street, Chelsea.</p>
