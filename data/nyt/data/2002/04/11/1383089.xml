        <p>From one end of the casbah to the other, people stared today at the rubble that had been their homes and cried out for help because one relative or another was buried.</p>
        <p>''I have two aunts still underneath,'' wailed Bashar Fratiekeh, pointing to a pile of rock. ''The whole house collapsed on us. It was 200 years old!''</p>
        <p>After four days of heavy fighting, the casbah, as the centuries-old warren of shops and homes at the center of this city is known, has been utterly destroyed.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian fighters who had holed up here for several days are dead, in hiding or under arrest. The number of dead among fighters and civilians was not yet known for sure. Some Palestinians put the number at 14.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, the Israeli soldiers were gone from the casbah, and survivors wandering the ruined streets told of tanks, helicopter gunships and fighter jets firing volley after volley into the old market overnight. After 14 Israeli soldiers were killed in Jenin on Tuesday, here in Nablus the army apparently decided to take no chances. An Israeli Army spokesman confirmed that the infantry had relied heavily on ''air support'' but would not be more specific.</p>
        <p>Abdel Ghaani Awadeh, 76 and dressed in traditional Arab clothes, stood in the street beside a car that had been flattened by a tank. ''I was here for the war with the British in 1936, the Germans in World War II, the Jews in 1948 and the 1967 war,'' he said. ''And I have never seen bloodshed like this. They had an appetite for killing.''</p>
        <p>This morning, Israeli soldiers shouting through megaphones urged survivors to surrender, and more than a dozen here did. At a nearby refugee camp, about 450 Palestinians gave themselves up.</p>
        <p>Palestinian witnesses said those who surrendered here were required to throw down their weapons and strip naked before walking out into the sunlight and the gun sights of Israeli soldiers. Their hands were in the air, holding only their identity cards.</p>
        <p>The soldiers wanted to make sure no one was concealing a bomb. The Palestinian fighters left behind dozens of them. Pipe bombs littered the gutters today, and long wires that were to be used as detonators still snaked around corners.</p>
        <p>Other gunmen are dead, though no one can yet say how many. Palestinians carried bodies out through the morning. ''Most were killed,'' said Mahmoud Musri, a merchant. ''The others, they left at dawn.''</p>
        <p>The 450 or so other Palestinians who surrendered today were at the nearby refugee camp in El Ain. There, residents said the damage was mostly caused by Israeli soldiers who had bored their way through interior walls to move from one home to the next so as not to expose themselves to gunfire on the streets.</p>
        <p>Here in the casbah the devastation was far greater. ''They bombed all the night,'' said Muhammad Abu Hatham, 52, a shopkeeper. ''There were many killed this morning.''</p>
        <p>Israeli tanks managed to penetrate deep into the market; some Palestinians claimed that they rolled over dead bodies. Tread marks were everywhere, and cars that had lain in their path were crushed. A tank had rolled over the passenger side of a maroon Renault parked at the side of an alley, shredding it. Inexplicably a plastic bottle of antifreeze sat on the flattened passenger seat, still sealed. ''Ready to use,'' it said in English and Hebrew.</p>
        <p>Dr. Abdel Fatah Lubadeh, an emergency physician, said he had seen the bodies of 11 people killed in overnight fighting; 63 more were wounded.</p>
        <p>As he had carried one wounded man to an ambulance last night, Dr. Lubadeh said, he had confronted an Israeli soldier and asked: '' 'Do you think this is the way you can stop terror?' He said nothing.''</p>
        <p>The house next door to Mr. Fratiekeh's was missing only its exterior wall, exposing several rooms, like a dollhouse. One was the bedroom of a young woman. Her high school graduation certificate hung, crooked, on a remaining wall. Rema Okashid, 20, had earned her degree from the school's commercial branch in 2000. Her neighbors said they did not know where she was.</p>
        <p>Outside, water from a broken main coursed down the street, around and through the rubble. A man's brown tennis shoe, laces tied, bobbed in the stream.</p>
        <p>One English word was everywhere. Children darted here and there, pointed at collapsed walls or holes in buildings and cried: ''Apache, apache!'' The Israeli Army, they said, had used American-made Apache helicopters to fire missiles and automatic weapons into the camp.</p>
        <p>''They killed my son right in front of my eyes,'' said Mahmoud Abdel Zallul, pointing to a bloodstained patch of dirt at his feet. ''He was a peaceful person.'' Next to the stain was a bloodied black face mask popular among some fighters.</p>
        <p>In the center of the casbah one large building was merely a pile of rubble, 20 feet high in places. Palestinians say it was a soap factory; Israelis say it held an arms cache, adding that they had discovered more than 20 labs in Nablus set up to make the bombs used by suicide bombers.</p>
        <p>Some, said an army spokesman, were in the soap factory.</p>
        <p>Even in the destruction, the ordinary rhythms of life persisted in some places.</p>
        <p>At a clock shop, open to the street because the exterior wall had been blown away, clocks signaled 2 p.m. with sweet-sounding chimes. Even with the wares of many stores exposed, if covered in dust, it did not appear that any looting had taken place.</p>
        <p>Some merchants were dragging metal plates or wooden planks out of the rubble, trying to use them to throw up a wall.</p>
        <p>Inside one confectionery shop, blocked by a mountain of debris thrown there by a massive armored bulldozer, a phone rang. No one could answer it.</p>
        <p>A moment later, a man's calm voice issued a greeting from the answering machine.</p>
