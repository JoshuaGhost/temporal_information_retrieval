        <p>ONE of the great mysteries of my life is whether my dog, Otto, is simple-minded or just really, really shrewd.</p>
        <p>The other day, for instance, Otto looked at me blankly when I said, ''Sit.'' When I tried other simple commands, like ''Stay'' and ''Stop lunging at that leftover sandwich like some kind of vicious land shark,'' he cocked his velvety brown head in puzzlement, as if to indicate that even after all these years he speaks no English.</p>

        <p>ONE of the great mysteries of my life is whether my dog, Otto, is simple-minded or just really, really shrewd.</p>
        <p>The other day, for instance, Otto looked at me blankly when I said, ''Sit.'' When I tried other simple commands, like ''Stay'' and ''Stop lunging at that leftover sandwich like some kind of vicious land shark,'' he cocked his velvety brown head in puzzlement, as if to indicate that even after all these years he speaks no English.</p>
        <p>But whenever I have a dog biscuit in my hand, he can fetch the newspaper, shake paws and conjugate irregular French verbs. If I suggest in a low voice that it's time to feed the dog, I will hear the telltale thump of a 70-pound Labrador bounding off a faraway second-floor bed. Within seconds he will skitter into the kitchen, panting, to delicately tap his food bowl once or twice for emphasis.</p>
        <p>Last week, when some friends arrived for a visit, Otto saw his opening. He leapt through the open doorway, brushed past my friend Peter, bolted across the street, knocked over a garbage can and disappeared into a backyard to pursue our cat.</p>
        <p>An eerie, shocked silence fell over the onlookers, broken only by the forlorn sound of my husband, who stood at the foot of the driveway and shook a box of dog biscuits as if he were a medicine man hoping to summon rain. ''Otto, Otto!'' he called plaintively, but the only sound I heard from across the street was a faint, raspy ''C'est moi, Otto.''</p>
        <p>Peter, still clutching a gift bag of wine in a white-knuckled grip, said cheerily, ''He's really well trained.''</p>
        <p>Actually, he's a big dope, but I can't help loving him. I don't think I could live without him. The dog, that is. And that's why I was upset when he returned a few minutes later without his collar. Or his identification tags. It's the third set he's slipped out of this month.</p>
        <p>So I immediately went online to buy him a new identification tag (''My name is Otto, lure me with biscuits''). I could have gone to the pet store in town, I suppose, but it's getting a little embarrassing to have to face the store owners.</p>
        <p>Also, I figured this would be a good opportunity to check out the much-diminished field of online pet-supply stores, a retail category that has shrunk considerably since those crazy halcyon days when the Pets.com sock puppet made guest appearances on ''Good Morning, America.'' Has it really been more than a year since that irritating terry cloth puppet stopped looming ominously over our pop-culture consciousness?</p>
        <p>Also on the defunct list since the last time I bought Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover online (I also have cats) are Petopia.com (which was bought out by Petco  .com) and Petstore.com (acquired by the ill-fated Pets.com).</p>
        <p>The two biggest online survivors, Petsmart.com and Petco.com, are online adjuncts of retail chains that have hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores nationwide.</p>
        <p>As far as I could tell, though, the only major impact this consolidation has wrought on the nation's pet owners is the end of the free-shipping wars that made it possible to get 20-pound bags of dog food delivered without charge to your doorstep.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, if you wanted to order, say, 10 jars of Leopard Gecko Food (for $29.90 at Petsmart.com or $27.21 at Petco.com), the shipping and handling would add $4.99 or $6.99, respectively, to your order.</p>
        <p>Aside from shipping deals, however, the price differences among the old competitors were not that great anyway, so it's a comfort to know I don't have to waste a half-hour comparing so many sites' per-ounce prices for Nature's Miracle.</p>
        <p>Besides, the best things to buy online for pets have always fallen into a category best described as quirky. I am thinking, for instance, of the Tennis Ball Slinger ($34.95) that my husband bought a while back at SitStay  .com, a slingshot with a four-ball magazine that can send a tennis ball more than 50 yards up the hill behind our house. After only a few hours of this activity, Otto gets tired. And if the slinger's surgical tubing wears out (dog spit turns out to be an amazing solvent), you can order replacement tubing.</p>
        <p>While I wouldn't dress my pets in human-like clothing (although now that I consider the possibility, the cats would look rather fetching in baby bonnets), plenty of pet owners would. Hence there are sites like Fonzie's Fantasies  (pet-clothing.net), where you can buy sun visors with leather linings in 12 sizes ($12 apiece), which makes it possible to accommodate sun-sensitive pigs, horses and llamas, as well.</p>
        <p>Dogs who are more interested in personal hygiene than my pet is might favor Yip Yap dog breath fresheners ($2.69 per tin at www.waggintails.com). The little bone-shaped breath sweeteners' ingredients include rosemary and parsley but also cooked liver, a substance I wouldn't instinctively consider aromatic.</p>
        <p>As for a dog identification tag, I found a selection at  Petsmart.com that included a reflective tag that will make Otto more visible in the event that he gallops off at night ($2.49) and a custom tag that you write on, then bake in a 300-degree oven to shrink ($2.99). At Petco.com, I seriously considered the heart-shaped Ruff &amp; Tumble flashing pet tag, but $9.99 is a lot of money to waste on something that will have to be replaced in a week or so.</p>
        <p>So in the end, I ordered the plain-Jane stainless steel embossed tag at dogtagsonline.com for $3.49 plus $1.50 for shipping and handling. The site offered suggested blocks of embossed texts (''Yipes!! I'm lost. Call Mommy at . . . ''). But what really hooked me was the description of the tags themselves: ''will not fade or rust, and are deeply embossed so that the text will not wear off like pet supply store engraved dog tags.''</p>
        <p>If that's true, then 100 years from now some neighborhood child will find a metal dog tag that says ''My Name is Otto'' buried in a bed of crocuses.</p>
