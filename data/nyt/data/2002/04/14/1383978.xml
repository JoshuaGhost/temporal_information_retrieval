        <p>''Everybody has to grow up someplace,'' Catherine Conant's mother used to tell her.</p>
        <p>The solace -- if it is that -- was living near Exit 11 of the turnpike. The memories of growing up in a place ''of factories and foundries and railroads, where the air smelled like rotten eggs'' make up the first of five stories on a CD called ''Exit 11 and Other Stories: Growing Up in the Shadow of the New Jersey Turnpike,'' a collection of stories told by Ms. Conant.</p>
        <p>The town, Hopelawn, doesn't really sound all that bad, thanks to a web of caring extended family. The other stories trace her growing up and out.</p>
        <p>''There's a myth that only people who grow up on farms or in small towns have stories about growing up,'' Ms. Conant said in an interview. ''But the universal themes exist wherever people live.''</p>
        <p>Including a place near Exit 11. The CD, $15 plus $3 for shipping, is available at (860) 526-4644 or www.4astoryteller.com</p>
