        <p>One reason the Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent comparatively little on financial aid to victims of the Sept. 11 attacks is that private charities have spent so much, agency officials said.</p>
        <p>According to these officials, the leading charities often failed to coordinate with FEMA and instead bowed to intense public pressure, hastily disbursing money to the same victims FEMA was ready to help. The unfortunate result, they said, was that tens of millions of dollars in donations were spent to provide help that was available from existing federal programs. ''The whole cart got put before the horse,'' a senior FEMA official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

        <p>One reason the Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent comparatively little on financial aid to victims of the Sept. 11 attacks is that private charities have spent so much, agency officials said.</p>
        <p>According to these officials, the leading charities often failed to coordinate with FEMA and instead bowed to intense public pressure, hastily disbursing money to the same victims FEMA was ready to help. The unfortunate result, they said, was that tens of millions of dollars in donations were spent to provide help that was available from existing federal programs. ''The whole cart got put before the horse,'' a senior FEMA official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Charity officials are livid at that criticism. ''Let me get this straight,'' said Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive of the Sept. 11 Fund, the second largest charity responding to the attacks. ''FEMA is saying, in effect, that the victims of Sept. 11 should be penalized and not get benefits that other disaster victims have gotten because the charities were quick to supply aid?'' He and other charity officials said that that it was FEMA's lack of communication that led to confusion.</p>
        <p>Despite numerous meetings and consultations with FEMA officials, the charities said the agency never informed them that it was sharply limiting its mortgage and rental assistance, a program that offers up to 18 months of housing payments to those who lost jobs as a result of the disaster. Consequently, they said, they believed FEMA was distributing aid throughout the 15-county disaster area -- as its public service announcements indicated -- while they focused their more limited resources on the most direct victims.</p>
        <p>Instead, FEMA gave attention to the very same victims the charities were already helping -- the families of those who were killed or injured or who lived and worked near the World Trade Center. But because many of those victims had already received help from the charities, they wound up ineligible for FEMA assistance.</p>
        <p>Just two tiny new charities formed by a homebuilders' trade group and a realtors' association, then, have together provided more mortgage and rent assistance than FEMA, which has so far spent roughly $13 million on such aid.</p>
        <p>Charities said they had to help families that might have qualified for FEMA's mortgage and rent assistance because the aid was slow in coming, difficult to get and, most important, available only when families faced eviction or foreclosure. ''It absolutely puts people in the situation where they've got to stand on the brink,'' one FEMA official said, acknowledging that the provision almost certainly scared away many potential applicants.</p>
        <p>Another FEMA official recalled how one widow tearfully protested that she had never been so much as a day late on her mortgage. If she waited for a foreclosure notice, she asked, what would happen if FEMA turned her down?</p>
        <p>In subsequent discussions with charities in New York, FEMA officials have suggested that a late payment notice would be sufficient, a position that FEMA finally made explicit in a public information brochure it began distributing to victims last month.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, FEMA employees have rejected scores of applicants because they had not yet reached the point of eviction or foreclosure. Even now, FEMA's aid application forms -- and its telephone hotline -- still advise people that they must be facing eviction or foreclosure before they can get help.</p>
