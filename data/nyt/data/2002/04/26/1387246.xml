        <p>The Jets might consider handing out ''Hi, My Name Is. . . . '' stickers this morning when their three-day minicamp opens because, more than anything else, it will serve as a protracted meet and greet.</p>
        <p>Five draft picks and seven players signed as free agents will gather with the rest of the squad at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Of those 12 players, 9 play defense.</p>
        <p>The Jets have overhauled their defense and there is a chance they could have seven new starters this season, including three of the four members of the secondary.</p>
        <p>Although most of the veterans have already been working out at the Jets' complex, this is the first chance to see them and the rookies on the field together.</p>
        <p>Last season, there were concerns within the organization about communication breakdowns among defensive players, leading, inevitably, to coverage breakdowns.</p>
        <p>The task during the minicamp and the off-season conditioning program is to meld players from so many different teams into a cohesive unit.</p>
        <p>''A lot comes from hanging, besides thinking about football, just getting to know each other and how each other reacts in certain situations,'' said cornerback Aaron Beasley, a free agent from Jacksonville. ''We've been doing a lot of that. We call it hanger-flying. We actually sit together and eat lunch together and find out each other's personalities and that really opens communications.''</p>
        <p>Although the Jets hope to land another veteran defensive tackle -- they signed Riddick Parker and drafted Alan Harper -- the transformation of the defense is nearly complete.</p>
        <p>In the moments after the draft ended, Coach Herman Edwards spoke of a plan to switch the focus of the defense from girth to speed. Edwards wants to play a brand of defense that emphasizes pressure on the quarterback and swarming linemen.</p>
        <p>With the drafting of the speedy defensive end Bryan Thomas in the first round and safety Jon McGraw in the second, the plan became evident.</p>
        <p>''With the guys we've gotten, we've done some good things,'' Edwards said. ''We're different now.''</p>
        <p>Safety Sam Garnes, the former Giant, said: ''This team, they're known for their offense. Offense are the head honchos here. I think things are going to even up a little bit. We had a lot of defensive players added to this team and we feel we have to dominate.''</p>
