        <p>Judges began recounting the votes from the December election, whose disputed result has thrown the country into turmoil. Marc Ravalomanana, who finished just short of a majority, says he was cheated out of victory and had refused to run in a second round against President Didier Ratsiraka unless a recount was held. After meeting last week in Senegal, Mr. Ravalomanana, who had proclaimed himself president and taken control of the capital, and Mr. Ratsiraka, whose supporters cut off the capital from the coastal ports, agreed to a recount. Under the agreement, if the recount does not yield a winner the men will meet in a runoff.</p>
