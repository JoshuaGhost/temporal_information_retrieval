        <p>While the Nets' starters were watching the scoreboard in Madison Square Garden last night, their reserves were dancing on the shadow of the Knicks, a mere formality to entering the postseason.</p>
        <p>By the end of the night, Indiana was the only team that truly mattered to the Nets.</p>
        <p>An hour after they closed out their 52-victory season with a 99-94 victory over the Knicks, the Nets learned that they would play host to Indiana. Led by the playoff stalwart Reggie Miller and the budding talent of Jermaine O'Neal, the Pacers will open a three-of-five-game series against the Nets at Continental Arena at 12:30 p.m. Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Nets began their season with a comeback triumph at home over the Pacers and wrapped up the series, 3-1, on Dec. 29. That was before Indiana made its blockbuster trade on Feb. 19, sending Jalen Rose and Travis Best to Chicago for Brad Miller, Ron Artest and Ron Mercer.</p>
        <p>''That definitely changed their chemistry and their look,'' said Nets forward Keith Van Horn, one of three players remaining who participated in the team's most recent playoff season, 1998.</p>
        <p>Now the Nets begin the postseason for the first time in four years against a team that has made the playoffs five straight years.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's difficult going into a game like that because we don't know how we match up against them,'' Van Horn said. ''But it will be good; we'll be more fired up. It will make us more eager to get out and play. I think we're all excited to go out and practice tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>For weeks, the Nets knew they were going to the playoffs, after holding the Eastern Conference's top spot for all but one day of the regular season. But they did not learn their opponent until last night.</p>
        <p>Indiana crushed the Philadelphia 76ers, who were minus three starters, for a 103-80 victory at Conseco Field House to earn the last playoff spot. Toronto seized the seventh spot in the East with a victory over Cleveland, while Milwaukee bottomed out with a loss to Detroit to open up the final berth for Indiana.</p>
        <p>Detroit, the second-seeded team, will play host to seventh-seeded Toronto, which won 12 of its last 14 games without Vince Carter to surge into a surprising playoff berth. The Sixers dropped to the sixth spot and will play the No. 3-seeded Boston Celtics, while the Orlando Magic will open against the Charlotte Hornets.</p>
        <p>Even though the Nets enter as the top team, their captain and point guard, Jason Kidd, was adamant that they not take Indiana (42-40) lightly.</p>
        <p>''The records will be 0-0; we have to mentally get ready and physically get ready,'' Kidd said. ''They have the talent, and also people might be overlooking them. Right now, our job is to protect home court.''</p>
        <p>The Nets finished 33-8 at Continental Arena, the third-best home record in the league.</p>
        <p>''We got our hands full; that's a very good basketball team,'' Nets Coach Byron Scott said. ''We haven't played them since the trade, and they're probably a better defensive team and a little bit more physical and aggressive.''</p>
        <p>The players did not know what to think of Indiana.</p>
        <p>''They're a good team, they're a young team, but we haven't played them, so I can't really say their identity as much,'' Kerry Kittles said.</p>
        <p>But Van Horn said that as much as Indiana may have changed since February, the Nets have also changed since the last time the teams played.</p>
        <p>''I think we've learned a lot, grown a lot, improved our halfcourt offense,'' he said. ''Our defense has just been strong. Biggest keys will be defense and rebounding.</p>
        <p>''If we're able to control the boards, we're going to be able to run the ball, no matter what people say.''</p>
        <p>The Nets have never been too concerned with their detractors. But they took time to savor last night's victory. The Nets (52-30) had an edge over the Knicks in this season of reversals. The Knicks (30-52) missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1986-87 season.</p>
        <p>''Who's in the playoffs?'' Kenyon Martin shouted gleefully to a few heckling fans in the third quarter. Later he said, ''We just let the people know in the area who the top team in the area is still.''</p>
        <p>Martin, who had returned from Dallas, where he attended a family funeral Tuesday, had only two goals for the game, ''not to get hurt and not to get in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Martin, who was frequently cited for flagrant fouls this season, played without incident, scoring 8 points in the first quarter and finishing with 13 points in 21 minutes.</p>
        <p>Scott did not play any of his starters more than 24 minutes, and all sat for the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Guard Lucious Harris sat on the bench in a suit, a last-minute scratch because of a sore right hamstring, which he hopes will be better by Saturday.</p>
        <p>As much as they wanted to stay healthy, the Nets, who had lost their previous two games, did not want to go into the playoffs with a three-game losing streak. ''We just wanted to finish on a good note,'' Kidd said.</p>
        <p>After breaking nearly every franchise record, the Nets now turn their attention to postseason goals.</p>
        <p>''We worked so hard to get to this point, and nobody ever thought we would get to this point,'' Scott said. ''Losing early means it wouldn't be a very successful season.''</p>
