        <p>Proceedings in Parliament were interrupted for the second straight day as opposition parties demanded the resignation of Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, a state that has been racked by the worst religious violence in a decade. Mr. Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalists who lead the nation's ruling coalition. Support for Mr. Modi has begun to drive a wedge between his party and some of its most important political allies.</p>
