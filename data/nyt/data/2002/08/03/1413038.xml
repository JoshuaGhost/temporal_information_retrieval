        <p>It is enough to make you think that fate has singled you out for suffering: walking from the unbearable heat of a summer subway platform into the truly unbearable heat of a subway car with no air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>But it also happens to subway riders who are billionaires, even those who have been elected the mayor of New York City.</p>
        <p>On his way back to City Hall after a meeting near Times Square on Thursday afternoon, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stepped into a No. 4 train at Grand Central Terminal and immediately wanted to step back out. The cooling system in his car was on its way to failing, just as temperatures were on their way to a high of 96 degrees.</p>
        <p>''I was with him,'' reported Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, ''and it was pretty stuffy.''</p>
        <p>The unlucky situation provided evidence that Mr. Bloomberg, who vowed to use public transportation every workday if elected, has been keeping his promise. Mr. Skyler said that the mayor took the subway to work nearly every morning, and on Thursday, in fact, took it three times.</p>
        <p>But the mayor's reaction to the hot-car experience was also a textbook case of how New York City Transit officials say riders should respond: take down the car number and call it in.</p>
        <p>Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the transit agency, said that after the mayor called Katherine Lapp, the executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, car No. 1623 was pulled from service and found to have a faulty part in its air-conditioning compressor. (Regular riders should call the hot-car hot line, (718) 330-3322, with the car number and the time of day of the problem.)</p>
        <p>During the summer, about 3 percent of subway cars have cooling problems, Mr. Seaton said. The agency's policy is that trains are not allowed out of their yards unless the air-conditioning in all cars is working. If a problem is reported once the train is in service, the train may continue its run to its terminal and then the faulty car is removed for repair.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to let a hot car roll around the system for two or three days,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Car No. 1623 was taken in for repairs at 4:29 p.m. Thursday, the cooling problem was fixed and the car remained in the shop because it was almost time for its regularly scheduled tune-up: every 66 days or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first.</p>
