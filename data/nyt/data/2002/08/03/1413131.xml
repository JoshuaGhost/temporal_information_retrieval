        <p>To create the kind of music festival that would truly represent the folk world, I knew in 1962 that I needed someone who had the respect of traditional musicians as well as contemporary performers. In other words, I needed Pete Seeger. In the autumn of that year, my wife Joyce and I drove to the Seegers' home in Beacon, N.Y. There, we discussed the future of the Newport Folk Festival, and that was how the nonprofit, musician-run folk festival was conceived.</p>
        <p>In 1963, Bob Dylan was a skinny kid with a nasal voice and an iconoclastic, oddball demeanor who had made a splash in the folk world. But Bob Dylan was not yet a nationally prominent artist. Peter, Paul and Mary, who had huge hit with Bob Dylan's song, ''Blowin' in the Wind,'' were scheduled to close the Friday night performance that year. But they insisted on appearing before intermission and that Bob close the show. His performance that night was a program of uncompromising, vivid, topical songs. He sang to a hushed, outdoor crowd of 15,000 people who took in every one of his poetic words. That performance established Bob Dylan as the reigning prince of the Newport Folk Festival.</p>

        <p>To create the kind of music festival that would truly represent the folk world, I knew in 1962 that I needed someone who had the respect of traditional musicians as well as contemporary performers. In other words, I needed Pete Seeger. In the autumn of that year, my wife Joyce and I drove to the Seegers' home in Beacon, N.Y. There, we discussed the future of the Newport Folk Festival, and that was how the nonprofit, musician-run folk festival was conceived.</p>
        <p>In 1963, Bob Dylan was a skinny kid with a nasal voice and an iconoclastic, oddball demeanor who had made a splash in the folk world. But Bob Dylan was not yet a nationally prominent artist. Peter, Paul and Mary, who had huge hit with Bob Dylan's song, ''Blowin' in the Wind,'' were scheduled to close the Friday night performance that year. But they insisted on appearing before intermission and that Bob close the show. His performance that night was a program of uncompromising, vivid, topical songs. He sang to a hushed, outdoor crowd of 15,000 people who took in every one of his poetic words. That performance established Bob Dylan as the reigning prince of the Newport Folk Festival.</p>
        <p>Two years later, in 1965, when Bob Dylan last performed at the festival, he was the linchpin in the antiwar protest songs movement. We all expected him to deliver more of these poignant songs during the festival. But he had made his own decision as to what he would do. Perhaps he recognized the Beatles' phenomenon and he wanted to be part of it. This could have either been a shrewd business move or a genuine musical statement. I believe it was a little of both.</p>
        <p>He had rehearsed late one night during the festival with a pick-up group from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. When he kicked off his performance with a rock 'n' roll version of ''Maggie's Farm,'' the audience was totally confused. Some people booed, there were cries of ''sellout!'' The prevailing mood in the crowd was that they had been betrayed. Backstage, pandemonium reigned. After a few excruciating minutes of the loud sound coming through the inadequate system, someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, ''Pete's really upset, maybe you should talk to him.'' I found Peter Seeger sitting in a parked car in the field behind the stage.</p>
        <p>''That noise is terrible!'' he cried. ''Can't we stop it?''</p>
        <p>I said, ''Pete, it's too late. There's nothing we can do.'' The legend that Pete threatened to cut the power cables with an ax is a myth.</p>
        <p>Bob Dylan did three songs and the band left the stage to a menacing rumble of thousands of hostile fans. I confronted Bob as he came off the stage.</p>
        <p>''You have to go back,'' I told him. ''You've got to play something acoustic.''</p>
        <p>''I don't want to, I can't go back,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Bob, we're going to have a riot on our hands if you don't.''</p>
        <p>''I don't have a guitar.''</p>
        <p>I turned to the assembled folk singers back stage. ''Does anyone have a guitar?'' What a question; this was the Newport Folk Festival. Peter Yarrow handed one to Bob. We ushered him to the stage. As he sang, ''It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,'' it was his adieu to Newport. It was a farewell to the purity of the folk revival.</p>
        <p>Bob Dylan returns to the Newport Folk Festival today after 37 years. After receiving invitations from us for the past 19 years, he finally scheduled an appearance at our festival. The question is what will he do at Newport? We have never asked. Whatever it is, it will be all right with me.</p>
