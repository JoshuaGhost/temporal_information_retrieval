        <p>The New York Philharmonic played the second of its two programs this summer at the Great Lawn in Central Park on Thursday night. Some 85,000 listeners and picnickers turned up for the performance and the Grucci fireworks afterward on what turned out to be a comfortably breezy evening.</p>
        <p>Two musicians made their Philharmonic debuts in this program, which had been played earlier at Cunningham Park in Queens and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. One was the conductor, Asher Fisch, music director of the New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv and an occasional visitor to the Metropolitan Opera and other American and European companies. The other was Alisa Weilerstein, a cellist who is barely into her 20's but has already done a good deal of touring, made an EMI recording and won an Avery Fisher Career Grant.</p>

        <p>The New York Philharmonic played the second of its two programs this summer at the Great Lawn in Central Park on Thursday night. Some 85,000 listeners and picnickers turned up for the performance and the Grucci fireworks afterward on what turned out to be a comfortably breezy evening.</p>
        <p>Two musicians made their Philharmonic debuts in this program, which had been played earlier at Cunningham Park in Queens and Prospect Park in Brooklyn. One was the conductor, Asher Fisch, music director of the New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv and an occasional visitor to the Metropolitan Opera and other American and European companies. The other was Alisa Weilerstein, a cellist who is barely into her 20's but has already done a good deal of touring, made an EMI recording and won an Avery Fisher Career Grant.</p>
        <p>It may be that the opening work, Rossini's ''William Tell'' Overture, was a nod to Mr. Fisch's operatic experience, although it is certainly a ubiquitous concert work on its own, with ample nonoperatic connections and consequent popular appeal. Mr. Fisch and the Philharmonic players were attentive to both its lyrical beauties and its energy, and Hai-Ye Ni, the associate principal cellist, gave a beautifully plaintive account of the solo cello line in the work's opening section.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisch also offered a vigorous, colorful reading of Rachmaninoff's ''Symphonic Dances'' (Op. 45), in which he ably mined the lugubriousness in the first movement, the Viennese lilt of the central Andante con moto, and the nimble energy of the finale. The orchestra put both its most solid brass and supple string playing at his disposal.</p>
        <p>Between those works, Ms. Weilerstein gave a reading of the Saint-SaÃ«ns Cello Concerto No. 1 (Op. 33) that seemed a bit breathless at first but quickly settled into a thoughtfully paced performance. Ms. Weilerstein's sound, to the extent that one could judge it through the amplification, can be both lush and cutting as the need arises. She has a good ear for coloration and a technique that is solid enough to make the brisk writing in the finale sound easy, but not so showy as to call attention to itself.</p>
        <p>The concert is to be repeated tonight at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.</p>
