        <p>U.S. Army investigators believe they have found the wreckage of a C.I.A. plane shot down over China 50 years ago, and they are looking for the remains of Robert C. Snoddy and Norman A. Schwartz, who were piloting a C-47 spy plane over northeast China in November 1952 in an attempt to retrieve a C.I.A. agent. The plane came under fire and the two pilots died in the crash, though two C.I.A. officers on board survived and spent 20 years in Chinese prisons.</p>
