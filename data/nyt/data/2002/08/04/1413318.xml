        <p>Like clothing designers who raid old fashion magazines for new ideas, fragrance makers are dipping into their archives to create reborn hits. This summer, Cacharel Paris reissued Ana誰s Ana誰s ($39.50 at Barneys New York), the ubiquitous 1978 eau de toilette; Prescriptives created Calyx Shimmering Mist ($45 at Bloomingdale's), a lighter version of its mid-80's favorite; and Love's Baby Soft cologne, the 70's teenage scent, is having a revival ($15 at CVS).</p>
        <p>For fall, Christian Dior will import two European successes of the 40's and 50's, Miss Dior and Diorissimo ($49.50 to $52 at Saks Fifth Avenue). Femme by Rochas, the French perfume worn by Katharine Hepburn in the 1940's, will return to America ($60 at Bergdorf Goodman), and Givenchy will celebrate its 50th anniversary by reviving L'Interdit ($55 for 1.7 ounces, at Sephora), a perfume created for Audrey Hepburn in 1957.</p>

        <p>Ann Gottlieb, owner of Ann Gottlieb Associates, a fragrance consulting firm, says, ''Consumers are attracted to scents associated with a more stable and tranquil time.'' Or maybe they just want to smell like a Hepburn.</p>
