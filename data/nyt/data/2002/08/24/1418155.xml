        <p>Americans like to call their politics a blood sport. They should come to Moscow, where to a worrisome degree that is more than just a metaphor.</p>
        <p>If assassins do not prey on members of Parliament every day -- once or twice a year seems more the norm -- sudden death is nevertheless a grim fact of life for elected officials and political appointees.</p>
        <p>For Vladimir Golovlyov, a member of Parliament and relentless critic of the Kremlin, Wednesday began in typical fashion. He rose early, dressed, summoned his two bodyguards and left his fashionable northwest apartment to walk his dog.</p>
        <p>In a curious way, the end was typical too. About 8 a.m., in a narrow strip of woods along his daily route, someone pumped two bullets from a foreign-made pistol into the back of his head. He died instantly. His bodyguards told investigators they had neither seen nor heard anything.</p>
        <p>A day earlier, hitmen gunned down the deputy chief of the Moscow city government's railway system, a political empire that includes the capital's sprawling subway and commuter rail network.</p>
        <p>In June the city's deputy mayor survived his second assassination attempt in 18 months, and a gunman killed the head of the Podolsk district, just outside Moscow. In March the head of the Ozyory district in the Moscow region died with his wife in an explosion in the northern suburbs that has variously been attributed to a car bomb and a rocket grenade.</p>
        <p>Then there are the deaths in the Russian boondocks: this month alone, hitmen dispatched the vice governor of the Smolensk region and the deputy mayor of Novosibirsk, who was the second deputy mayor from that Siberian capital to be gunned down in 11 months.</p>
        <p>Politics is the thread that runs through the attacks and killings, but knowledgeable outsiders say it is rarely the motive.</p>
        <p>''There are practically no political murders here,'' said Larisa Kislinskaya, a writer for the newspaper Sovershenno Sekretno, or Top Secret, whom some call Moscow's best crime reporter.</p>
        <p>Rather, the usual reason is money. The perpetrators are believed to be mostly organized crime figures or business tycoons whose victims either thwarted their criminal plans or were in league with them.</p>
        <p>That they do not hesitate to kill politicians -- and that remarkably few political assassins are ever caught -- is testament to the frailty of Russia's emerging justice system and the depth of official corruption.</p>
        <p>''From my experience, these crimes are being solved only when somebody comes out in the open with an open accusation,'' said Dmitri Volkov, who was an investigative reporter for the now defunct Moscow daily Vremya Novostei. ''The sad fact is that such business practices cannot be uprooted in a year or two, or three.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, they have not been uprooted in a decade of independence, though some statistics suggest that the overall pace of contract murders has declined by more than half since their peak in the mid-1990's, when as many as 400 hits occurred each year.</p>
        <p>Most victims are thugs or businessmen. But at least nine members of Parliament have been murdered since Russia became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and a number of others have been wounded or have escaped hits unscathed.</p>
        <p>During the two-year session of Parliament's lower house that ended in 1999, a dozen legislative aides were murdered. Most were later found to have had criminal ties.</p>
        <p>In Moscow, assassins have trained guns, bombs and even vials of acid on a bewildering array of officeholders, some of whose duties might seem as dull as a notary's job: the Moscow education administrator, the head of the national sports foundation, two deputy mayors, a covey of district administrators and -- yes -- the chief of Russian notaries, Anatoly Tikhenko, shot dead in his apartment doorway almost 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>His case is instructive. In Russia, where a leviathan bureaucracy demands an official seal on nearly everything short of a sneeze, it turns out that the notary's job is lucrative and powerful. Mr. Tikhenko campaigned to purge the notary rolls of criminal elements and to reform notary regulations, two passions that appear to have been his undoing.</p>
        <p>Moscow's education czar, who survived a 1997 hit, is said to have run afoul of shady figures who wanted a chunk of the city's textbook market.</p>
        <p>The deputy railway chief who died this week, Sergei Paristyi, had been trying to curb a black market in forged rail and bus tickets.</p>
        <p>The deputy mayor who was attacked for the second time in June, Iosif Ordzhonikidze, supervises the city's hotel and casino business, among others. Assassins nearly killed him in December 2000. This time, guards killed one of his assassins, whom news reports identified as a cousin of a prominent hotelier. The police say their inquiry has been stymied by a lack of cooperation.</p>
        <p>Finally there is Mr. Golovlyov, 45, a three-term legislator from Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, who is said to have escaped a similar attack last spring thanks to his dog.</p>
        <p>Allies have been quick to label his death political. There is political motive aplenty: the Liberal Party, which he helped found, is the brainchild of Boris A. Berezovsky. Mr. Berezovsky, the Russian financier in exile accused by the government of embezzlement, is perhaps the most ferocious critic and despised foe of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Kislinskaya, the crime reporter, says the likely reason for the killing lies in Chelyabinsk, where Mr. Golovlyov supervised the messy and corrupt business of privatizing government property in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors investigating that business sought last year to lift his parliamentary immunity from arrest, hinting that he had embezzled as much as $600 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golovlyov said publicly that he was being persecuted for his political affiliation, which did not necessarily mean that he was innocent. Few politicians came away from the privatization schemes with empty pockets. Some now say Mr. Golovlyov was killed by former cronies because he had jumped to the side of the law, helping the investigators.</p>
        <p>Liliya Shevtsova, an analyst of regional politics at Moscow's branch of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Golovlyov had grown from a shadowy manipulator into an ardent advocate of liberal democracy. Many of Russia's nouveau riche class, including Mr. Berezovsky, have followed the same route.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shevtsova called Mr. Golovlyov's death ''the perfect example of the ambiguity of Russian politics.''</p>
        <p>''Russian politicians and personalities cannot be put into neat categories, black or white,'' she said. ''Russia is operating in the gray zone. The most staunch and energetic defenders of democracy have this kind of shadowy past.''</p>
        <p>Which suggests that reformers and Russian democracy will be trailed by hitmen for at least some years to come.</p>
        <p>''Money has a big trail behind it,'' said Mr. Volkov, the journalist. ''And I think that before we truly call ourselves civilized, there will be a lot more contract killings and attempts on the lives of officials.''</p>
