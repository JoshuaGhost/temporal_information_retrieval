        <p>Darnell Dinkins blanched the first time a coach suggested he play something other than quarterback. He was at the University of Pittsburgh, a former high school star, and Dinkins was taken aback -- insulted, really -- when Pitt Coach Johnny Majors suggested he could shift to defensive back.</p>
        <p>That was years ago, before Dinkins struggled to find a job in football, before he played semi-pro, before he worked as an assistant supervisor for juvenile probation in Pittsburgh, and long before he went to the Giants' training camp as the fourth-string quarterback with virtually no chance of making the team.</p>
        <p>But when Giants Coach Jim Fassel singled out Dinkins for his diligence and aggressiveness in a team meeting Saturday night and promised he would give him every chance to make the roster -- at a position other than quarterback -- Dinkins was so touched he believed Fassel to be an instrument of God.</p>
        <p>Dinkins's crushing hit on punt returner Kevin Faulk in the third quarter of the Giants' 22-19 victory against New England stood out, on a night when Fassel was preoccupied with the failures of the special teams. Fassel lectured place-kicker Owen Pochman on the sidelines after Pochman hit a kickoff out of bounds -- later, Pochman reached only the 14-yard line and set up a New England score -- and Fassel did the same with punter Rodney Williams after he produced a 23-yard dud.</p>
        <p>Pochman and Williams both play high-profile positions, and Fassel continues to do everything he can to simulate the pressure they will face during the season. Asked about Williams's inconsistency, Fassel was direct, saying, ''The way I equate inconsistency in a guy with one good, one bad, I equate 8-8 seasons, and I don't like that.''</p>
        <p>Williams is trying to adjust to the punt philosophy of the new special teams coach Bruce Read, who is asking for increased hang time, as well as distance, to give the coverage more opportunity to reach the returner before he makes his break. ''He said the adjustment wasn't going to be pretty,'' Williams said. ''It's a matter of not finding a happy medium.''</p>
        <p>The special teams were charged with five penalties and allowed a kickoff return average of 31.3 yards; a low snap from Jody Littleton also cost the Giants a go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter. But in Albany yesterday, Fassel found consolation in a videotape review of Saturday's game; there were instances when one player made a silly mistake and sabotaged the efforts of the other 10 members of a special teams unit. ''I can't blame the whole team,'' Fassel said. ''I can blame that guy.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' coverage units have not practiced at full speed, and Fassel does not intend to change this, because of the risk of injury. But there will be alterations, including the addition of Dinkins to the first line of all the special teams units. Fassel has rained praise on Dinkins over the last two weeks for his work habits and wants to keep him on the team, and this week Fassel will try to identify a primary position for Dinkins to play, because he will not be a quarterback; the Giants already have Kerry Collins, Jesse Palmer and Jason Garrett.</p>
        <p>Dinkins had already been working out at tight end, and while Fassel did not announce his intentions yesterday, that is probably the skill position at which the Giants have the least depth. ''I told him I'd put him where he has the best chance to make the team,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Dinkins is listed at 6 feet 3 inches and 235 pounds, quick and powerful, and it was his athleticism that prompted Majors to shift Dinkins at Pitt. After leaving his supervisor's job in February, Dinkins played with the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe and became a force on special teams. But what Fassel first seemed to notice about Dinkins was his intense preparation, constant study of videotape before and after practices, his improvement from day to day, his accountability. Slowly, Dinkins has become more prominent in his roles on special teams.</p>
        <p>Months ago, linebacker Micheal Barrow said, Fassel was telling the fringe players that he would reserve some places on the roster for those who excelled at special teams. ''I don't know how many people actually believed it,'' Barrow said. ''You can't look at it as an insult. You have to look at it as an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Dinkins ''wants it,'' Barrow said. ''When he steps on that field, he has that want-to: he wants to be involved on every play,'' Barrow said. ''We saw it on that hit.''</p>
        <p>Gabe Lindstrom, who is challenging Williams for the punter's job, popped the ball near New England's 15-yard line, where Faulk was stationed. But Faulk did not call for a fair catch and milliseconds after the ball dropped into his hands, Dinkins leveled Faulk, drawing an awed reaction from the Giants Stadium crowd.</p>
        <p>''That was one of those 'Waterboy' hits,'' Barrow said later, referring to the Adam Sandler movie in which an unstable linebacker channeled his rage into every hit.</p>
        <p>Dinkins bounced to his feet and jumped around; Fassel clapped, having seen Dinkins rewarded for his work ethic. ''I'll play wherever they want,'' Dinkins said. ''I just want to be in the N.F.L.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Offensive tackle JEFF HATCH, the Giants' third-round pick, moved slowly in street clothes after Saturday's game, clearly favoring his left leg. Hatch has a disk problem in his lower back and has been getting treatment since his injury occurred two and a half weeks ago. Giants Coach JIM FASSEL said a decision could be made later this week on the direction of Hatch's treatment; surgery is a possibility. . . . ANTONIO WARREN scored the game-winning touchdown on a meandering 30-yard fourth-quarter run in Saturday's exhibition. But Warren -- who played in the Canadian Football League last year for the Calgary Stampeders -- is fifth on the depth chart among the Giants' tailbacks and is a long shot to make the team. . . . Fassel is hopeful center DUSTY ZEIGLER will recover from knee surgery in time to play in the season opener, but Fassel said preparations will be made in case Zeigler is not ready. . . . Offensive tackle LUKE PETITGOUT, who missed Saturday's game because of headaches, will practice Thursday.</p>
