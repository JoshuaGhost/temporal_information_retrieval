        <p>GUADAGNO-Anton. Absolutely shocked and saddened at the news of the passing of my dear friend Anton Guadagno. My heart and prayers go out to you, Dolores, and your family for this great loss. My relationship with ''the Maestro'' goes far beyond our opera association. He was a great gentleman and a true friend. His passing leaves a very large, unfillable void. He was truly one of a kind. M. Mac Schwebel, President Palm Beach Opera</p>
