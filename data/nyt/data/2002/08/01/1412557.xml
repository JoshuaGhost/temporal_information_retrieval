        <p>Over the next two years, and perhaps for a good deal longer, major Mexican art shows will be at American museums almost without interruption. There will also be many smaller shows, along with presentations of Mexican music, theater and dance in modern as well as traditional forms.</p>

        <p>From ancient Mayan heads to modern video installations, the culture of Mexico is surging into the United States.</p>
        <p>Over the next two years, and perhaps for a good deal longer, major Mexican art shows will be at American museums almost without interruption. There will also be many smaller shows, along with presentations of Mexican music, theater and dance in modern as well as traditional forms.</p>
        <p>This new wave of cultural generosity supports the politics of President Vicente Fox, who favors closer relations between the United States and Mexico.</p>
        <p>''It is not a coincidence,'' said Ignacio Durán, cultural minister at the Mexican Embassy here. ''It's a concerted effort. It has been under way for some time, but now it's reaching a peak.''</p>
        <p>''Mexico considers this a very effective instrument,'' he said. ''People who appreciate the culture of a country begin to identify with that country. I think it has a beneficial influence on policy.''</p>
        <p>Since March the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston has been showing decorative and fine art from the period of Spanish rule over Mexico. It is a broad and revealing exhibition, with objects ranging from intricately carved furniture and silver candelabra to a vivid 18th-century portrait of a self-confident noblewoman. After this show closes in Houston on Aug. 4, it will travel to the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and the San Diego Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Next spring the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here will stage a four-week festival of Mexican performers. In keeping with the image that Mexico now wants to promote, mariachi and Tex-Mex bands will share the program with modern dance companies, jazz ensembles, mime troupes and experimental theater.</p>
        <p>From October 2003 until July 2004, a large and comprehensive show of Mayan art will be mounted in the United States, first in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco and then at the National Gallery of Art here.</p>
        <p>Scores of other cultural programs sponsored at least partly by Mexican government agencies are under way or planned across the United States. Some are small in scale, like a literary and diplomatic reception that was recently held here to honor the late poet and philosopher Octavio Paz, who died in 1998. Others are highly ambitious, like a film festival that would trace the history of Mexican cinema through 120 movies from Sergei Eisenstein's 1932 classic ''Que Viva Mexico'' to the current hit ''Y Tu Mamá También.''</p>
        <p>Mexico is portrayed in ''Y Tu Mamá También'' as vibrant and exciting but also rife with corruption. That has not prevented cultural advisors to President Fox, who presents his government as a break with much of Mexico's political past, from using it to showcase their country's artistic originality.</p>
        <p>The chief curator of El Museo del Barrio in New York, Fatima Bercht, said Mexico devotes far more resources than any other Latin American country to promoting its culture in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The Mexican government has become very involved in lending objects and arranging exhibitions,'' Ms. Bercht said. ''A lot of their most magnificent work is traveling these days, especially to the United States. It's aimed at giving people here the image of a modern and diverse Mexico.'' Mexican cultural planners are also discussing ideas for big shows they can send to the United States in the future. One would be a rich program of exhibitions, performances and public events tracing the relationship between Mexico City and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The Mexican government generally pays at least part of the cost of mounting these shows. It will, for example, pay between one-fourth and one-half of the cost of the Kennedy Center series. It also works with private institutions that arrange American shows on their own, like the Franz Meyer Museum in Mexico City, which provided the colonial works now on display in Houston.</p>
        <p>Some Mexican shows are mounted at galleries and theaters connected to one or more of the 47 Mexican consulates in the United States. The consulate in Albuquerque, for example, recently showed folk masks that one local critic compared to ''the best portrait sculptures in the world.''</p>
        <p>Mexico also maintains four large cultural institutes in United States cities that are in almost constant activity. This summer the institute in San Antonio showed works by José Luis Cuevas, one of Mexico's most admired living artists. In September the Miami institute, which opened this year, will mount a survey of contemporary Mexican art.</p>
        <p>Since President Fox took office in December 2000, the principal object of Mexico's cultural largesse has been the United States. Other countries, however, are also benefiting. A show billed as the most comprehensive survey of Aztec culture ever assembled is scheduled to open in November at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and will not be seen anywhere else. It is being sponsored in part by the Mexican Tourist Board, and will be accompanied by a four-month festival that organizers say ''will introduce British audiences to the latest in Mexican contemporary culture.''</p>
        <p>Mexico is hardly the first country to use its cultural patrimony to enhance its image in the world. During the cold war, the C.I.A. covertly promoted American abstract art in Europe in the hope that it would give the United States an aura of excitement and modernity. In the 1990's China sent several magnificent shows abroad as part of a global public relations campaign that culminated with its winning membership in the World Trade Organization and the right to serve as host of the Olympic Games in 2008.</p>
        <p>Nor is the Mexican government the only sponsor of Mexican cultural events in the United States. Some are sponsored by private companies, like a new handicraft show at the National Museum of the American Indian in New York, for which the Banamex banking group is paying.</p>
        <p>Other shows involve private collections of Mexican art. One that has proven highly popular was assembled by Jacques Gelman, a movie producer who fled to Mexico from his native Russia during World War I, and his Czech-born wife, Natasha. He died in 1986. The show has been touring this country for more than two years to excellent reviews, and will be at El Museo del Barrio until Sept. 22, after which it travels to the Seattle Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>The Gelman collection includes work by many of the finest 20th-century Mexican artists, and wherever it is shown it attracts many patrons who come especially to see paintings by Frida Kahlo.</p>
        <p>''These days I see the Mexicans absolutely eager to promote their culture, especially stuff that we don't normally see here, stuff that doesn't fit the stereotype,'' said Alicia Adams, director of international programs at the Kennedy Center. ''They understand that arts and culture are the best way to bridge the gap with us. That's the way to make us see them in a different light.''</p>
