        <p>Re ''Bloomberg Finds Some of City's Woes Resist His Solutions'' (Political Memo, Aug. 10): Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will indeed get diplomats to pay their parking tickets. The agreement in principle he signed on Aug. 9 requires them to pay a substantial portion of the debt incurred since 1997 and all future fines.</p>
        <p>Collecting this debt has been the holy grail of diplomatic parking. Towing, the enforcement tool of last resort, is exactly what the city has been trying to avoid because it's a waste of everyone's time and money.</p>

        <p>The Giuliani administration almost had a deal, but it was never finalized. We hope to conclude a deal on Aug. 21 that will improve traffic safety and allow the city to collect debts from diplomats without impeding the important work they do.</p>
