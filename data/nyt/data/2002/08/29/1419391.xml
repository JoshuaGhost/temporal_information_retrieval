        <p>SEPTEMBER 11  An Oral History  By Dean E. Murphy  250 pages. Doubleday. $22.95.</p>
        <p>A year later, it's still the ones who jumped. Nothing else -- not the planes slamming into the towers, not the buildings collapsing like sand castles, not the cloud of smoke and debris chasing throngs through the streets of Lower Manhattan -- is as profoundly disturbing as the image of people stepping out of skyscrapers and dropping to certain death.</p>
        <p>Martin Glynn, a computer programmer who worked on the 80th floor of the South Tower, made eye contact with a North Tower jumper: ''I followed him to the 30th floor when I couldn't look any more. I got dizzy and ill.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glynn is one of 40 survivors whose firsthand recollections of that unforgettable day are included in ''September 11: An Oral History,'' written and compiled by Dean E. Murphy, a reporter for The New York Times who was pulled off the mayoral race on the morning of Sept. 11 to cover the attacks.</p>
        <p>There is a range of accounts here, from people rushing out of burning buildings to people rushing in. There are those who remained calm, and those who became hysterical. Some told themselves that they were going to die, others convinced themselves that they had to live. Some managed to avert their eyes from the horror all around them, and some, like Mr. Glynn, felt compelled to look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy leaves the accounts in the words of the survivors, and the colloquialisms can be jarring (''Dude, that place is on fire!'' being the most glaring example). ''September 11'' is also frustratingly devoid of photographs of the speakers: one longs to put faces to these harrowing tales. But these are minor points. This is a powerful book, one that puts to rest the question of whether, after all the media saturation, there is anything to be gained by revisiting this nightmare. In the weeks following Sept. 11, the enormity of the event made it difficult to appreciate the personal stories; it was hard not to lose the trees for the forest.</p>
        <p>The distance of a year enables a different perspective. ''It was a day of national calamity,'' Mr. Murphy writes in his introduction. ''But it was also a day of individual human heartache.''</p>
        <p>Certain details stand out. An emergency medical worker who is labeling the casualties with colored tags to indicate the severity of their injuries comes across a woman totally disfigured below the diaphragm. She can't have more than a few minutes to live. The medic takes out a black tag, and is startled to hear her speak. Rightly intuiting the worst, she argues with him: ''I am not dead.'' A young man who has just started his first job after graduating from college rides the train in from Long Island with his father and his best friend and rides home later that day with only his father.</p>
        <p>Even for those of us who weren't downtown when the planes struck, these oral histories trigger certain recollections, collective emotional muscle memories. There was the anger, the desire for immediate revenge, but also that feeling of vulnerability: the odds seemed as good as not that there was another plane gunning for the Empire State Building -- the Brooklyn Bridge, too, for that matter. One of Mr. Murphy's survivors recalls the mass panic that ensued when cars started to explode. Everyone assumed they were car bombs. They were automobile gas tanks being ignited by hot pieces of falling steel.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of the calamity came into focus both suddenly and gradually. Some felt the need to continue with daily tasks. A stockbroker fleeing the 60th floor of the South Tower remembers taking the time to drop off an envelope to someone at the New York Stock Exchange before heading uptown. Reading these accounts, you can't help wondering what you would have done. Had you been on your way down the stairs of the South Tower when a voice over the PA system told you that it was safe to return to your office, would you have? Or would you, like Stephen Miller, a computer systems administrator on the 80th floor, have continued down?</p>
        <p>There are occasional flickers of light in the darkness. In Washington a military officer notices an ''untarnished'' Marine Corps flag waving from the fourth floor of the Pentagon after the attack. A South Tower survivor who can't find a working phone changes the message on his voice mail to announce that he is alive. Most moving of all, there's a 6-foot-5-inch, 250-pound naval commander catching people as they jump out of windows at the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, there is darkness. ''September 11'' is not an easy book to pick up. It's also not an easy book to put down.</p>
