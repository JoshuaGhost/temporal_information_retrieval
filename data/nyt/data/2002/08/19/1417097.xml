        <p>Over the last decade more than 300 women have disappeared from the streets of Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, many later found raped and murdered, their bodies dumped in ditches and the desert. But even more stunning than the number of deaths has been the failure of law enforcement officials to put a stop to the killings.</p>
        <p>A trail of newspaper articles about the murders led Lourdes Portillo, a San Francisco filmmaker who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, not far from Juárez, to this unsolved mystery just across the border from El Paso. Initially, she said, her intention was to profile some of the victims and create a memorial to ''these girls,'' but soon she found herself trying to figure out what happened to them and why.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a journalist, but it was so compelling to try to find out what really happened,'' Ms. Portillo said in a telephone interview from her home in San Francisco. Her search for answers is chronicled in ''Señorita Extraviada'' (''Missing Young Woman''), a documentary to be shown tomorrow night on PBS. The film has already won several awards, including a special jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Even more rewarding, Ms. Portillo said, is that the film may lead to action. With her blessing it is being shown to politicians, human rights activists and student groups to rally support in both Mexico and the United States for a more thorough investigation of the deaths.</p>
        <p>The cases date back to 1993, when high school and college students, store clerks and housewives, as well as the poor single women drawn to Juárez from all over Mexico to work in hundreds of mostly American-owned maquiladoras, or assembly plants, began vanishing from the streets, often in daylight, on their way home from work or to visit friends or to job interviews.</p>
        <p>At first officials faulted the women themselves, saying that the victims moved in ''high-risk'' circles of gang members and prostitution. But as shown in the documentary, which includes pictures of scores of the women and visits with some of their families, the only obvious pattern is that most of the victims were poor, dark-skinned and slim with shoulder-length hair.</p>
        <p>Ms. Portillo's interviews with relatives of the victims, Mexican law-enforcement officials and women who survived their attacks indicate that there are many theories about who can be behind so many deaths: serial killers, drug traffickers, opportunists emboldened to commit copycat murders. One woman, María Talamantez, even points at police officers, saying that when she went to report the beating of her husband by neighbors, a group of officers at the station raped her and showed her graphic pictures of some of the murdered women as they were killed.</p>
        <p>Relatives of the victims and women's advocates also discuss evidence that some of the women may have been targeted inside the maquiladoras where they worked.</p>
        <p>But more significant to Ms. Portillo, who wrote, produced, directed and narrated the film, is why the murders are still happening. Even in the lawlessness of Juárez, a city of 1.2 million people and a center for drug trafficking, Ms. Portillo argued that the lack of progress in catching the culprits reflected an almost cavalier attitude toward the victims.</p>
        <p>''There's an element that the women are not worth the trouble,'' she said. ''There's an incredible disregard for poor, brown women. There's a racist attitude and a classist attitude.''</p>
        <p>Few of the killings have been solved. Repeatedly Mexican authorities have arrested and charged suspects, including members of a Mexican gang, bus drivers on routes serving the maquiladoras and an Egyptian-born chemist with a record of sexual battery in the United States who worked at one of the assembly plants. But a lack of evidence has hampered the prosecution of cases. (The Egyptian suspect, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, was convicted in 1996 of murder, but a court later overturned that conviction, although he remains in custody.)</p>
        <p>And each time, as the officials have declared the problem solved, the murders have continued.</p>
        <p>In the course of 18 months of filming in 1999 and 2000, Ms. Portillo said, 50 more women were killed. The film notes that many bodies have shown evidence of torture and mutilation, fueling bizarre rumors and speculation about ritual sacrifices. Ms. Portillo said she herself felt ''very unsafe'' and that the sister of a woman she had interviewed, for example, disappeared not long after the interview. ''I had the paranoid feeling that the deaths were coming close to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Portillo said she came away convinced that the killers come from the drug trade and remained at large because ''they have the power to buy everyone off.'' She said she believed there was a ''pyramid of complicity.''</p>
        <p>Relatives of the victims and women's groups say the cases have been hampered by contaminated or destroyed evidence, threats against witnesses and police corruption and incompetence.</p>
        <p>They have organized to put pressure on the government to start a federal investigation. There are also calls for American law-enforcement officials to investigate; some criminal profilers suspect the killers may be crossing into the United States to avoid detection. The agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in El Paso, Hardrick Crawford Jr., who recently met with Mexican officials on the matter, has called the slayings ''a crime against humanity'' and endorsed a binational task force, The El Paso Times reported.</p>
        <p>Clemencia Prieto, co-chairwoman of the Coalition Against Violence Toward Women and Families on the Border, an El Paso-based group that was formed to call attention to the deaths, said the film was helping generate awareness of ''the tragedy of the situation.'' She said that in El Paso it has been shown to University of Texas students and at fund-raisers for women's groups.</p>
        <p>''Many people didn't know the magnitude of the problem,'' she said. ''It's had tremendous impact.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Portillo, 58, has explored other murders and what she calls ''the dark side of our psyche'' in 23 years as a filmmaker. Her 1985 documentary ''Las Madres: The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo,'' which was nominated for an Oscar, is about the mothers of victims of political repression in Argentina in the 1970's. In ''The Devil Never Sleeps'' (1994) she investigated the mysterious death of a multimillionaire uncle, and in ''Corpus: A Home Movie for Selena'' (1999) she examined the impact that the slain singer Selena Quintanilla had on her fans.</p>
        <p>But ''Señorita Extraviada,'' she said, has been unique in the magnitude and seeming hopelessness of the situation. ''This one really got me down because it's something that's ongoing and has no end in sight,'' she said. ''It's incredible what's happening,'' she added. ''It's disgusting.''</p>
