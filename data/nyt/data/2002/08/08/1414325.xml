      <abstract>
        <p>Judge Robert G Doumar cancels hearing at which Justice Department was to explain why it classified Yasser Esam Hamdi, American citizen raised in Saudi Arabia who was captured during war in Afghanistan, as enemy combatant, denying him rights afforded to either prisoner of war or someone indicted in a crime; cites dispute between Hamdi and government over whether case can proceed in light of government-requested stay issued earlier by federal appeals court; analysts suggest that Doumar appears to be allowing matter to be resolved by appeals court before pressing ahead for hearing on merits (M)</p>

        <p>In a standoff over the constitutional rights of prisoners captured during the war in Afghanistan, a federal judge in Virginia took the rare action today of suspending all proceedings in a case in which the government has classified a prisoner as an ''enemy combatant'' with almost no legal protections.</p>
        <p>The judge, Robert G. Doumar, of Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., canceled a hearing scheduled for Thursday in which the government was to explain why it had classified Yasser Esam Hamdi, a prisoner who was born in Louisiana and raised in Saudi Arabia, as an enemy combatant. The government says the classification denies a person the rights afforded to either a prisoner of war or someone indicted in a crime.</p>

        <p>In a standoff over the constitutional rights of prisoners captured during the war in Afghanistan, a federal judge in Virginia took the rare action today of suspending all proceedings in a case in which the government has classified a prisoner as an ''enemy combatant'' with almost no legal protections.</p>
        <p>The judge, Robert G. Doumar, of Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., canceled a hearing scheduled for Thursday in which the government was to explain why it had classified Yasser Esam Hamdi, a prisoner who was born in Louisiana and raised in Saudi Arabia, as an enemy combatant. The government says the classification denies a person the rights afforded to either a prisoner of war or someone indicted in a crime.</p>
        <p>The judge's action came after the Justice Department refused to hand over by noon on Tuesday documents justifying the government's labeling of Mr. Hamdi as an enemy combatant.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department told the judge that his order was premature and conflicted with a stay of further proceedings in the case that the appeals court had imposed in June.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has also raised questions about Judge Doumar's jurisdiction in the case, and some legal analysts said today that the judge appeared to be allowing that matter to be resolved by the appeals court before pressing ahead for a hearing on the merits.</p>
        <p>Judge Doumar has suggested for months that Mr. Hamdi had certain legal rights as an American citizen. But government prosecutors have consistently rejected this notion, arguing that Mr. Hamdi was an enemy combatant and as such had no right to a lawyer and did not need to be charged with any specific crime while he was held in the brig at the Norfolk Naval Station.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the government has argued that the executive branch has the sole authority to make such determinations in a time of war and that under the separation of powers clause of the Constitution the judiciary has little room to overrule decisions by the commander in chief.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department had challenged Judge Doumar's order for the documents, saying it was inappropriate and that the material he requested was highly sensitive. With the stage set for a confrontation between the parties on Thursday in Norfolk, the judge did not respond to that challenge.</p>
        <p>But in a terse order today, the judge canceled that hearing. He cited a dispute between Mr. Hamdi and the government over whether the case could proceed in light of a government-requested stay that had been issued earlier by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials would not comment on today's action.</p>
        <p>Frank W. Dunham Jr., the public defender appointed to represent Mr. Hamdi, said he thought the judge's order made sense because the issue of whether the stay remained in effect had not been resolved.</p>
        <p>''Once he realized that both sides thought the stay was in effect, he needed to pull back,'' Mr. Dunham said. ''It's a confusing procedural situation.''</p>
        <p>Outside legal experts following the case were mystified by the judge's action.</p>
        <p>Elisa Massimino, director of the Washington office of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, speculated that he might be trying to force the appeals court, which has ruled twice in favor of the government, to resolve the issue of a stay in order to clear the decks for arguments over the merits of the case.</p>
        <p>The judge had asked for copies of all statements made by Mr. Hamdi, including statements in interviews conducted solely for intelligence purposes, the names and addresses of anyone who had interrogated him, copies of any statements made by the Northern Alliance forces about him, a chronology of his whereabouts while under military control. The government said the request was intrusive and unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunham said that in withholding this information, the government ''did what any litigant would do who is in a posture like that and doesn't want to produce documents.'' But, he said, ''I would like at some point to get to the merits of the case instead of this procedural haggling.''</p>
