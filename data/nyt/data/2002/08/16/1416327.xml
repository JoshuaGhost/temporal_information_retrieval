        <p>Appraisal of campaign advertisement for Gov George E Pataki of New York featuring former Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani; photos (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For the first time in their long, parallel careers, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is featured in a campaign advertisement for Gov. George E. Pataki. This 30-second advertisement began to be broadcast statewide yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Chris Mottola</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- On the right side, Mr. Giuliani's head and shoulders fill one panel, as the former mayor, in a dark suit and seated against a dark background, delivers testimonials to the governor's character. On the left, another panel silently shows Mr. Pataki in shirt sleeves, greeting groups of people, mostly children, in the sunny outdoors, smiling, hugging, shaking hands. One oddity is that the side-by-side panels, each shaped like a television screen, leave much of the larger screen black above and below, so that the images of Mr. Pataki's and Mr. Giuliani's faces are rather small.</p>

        <p>For the first time in their long, parallel careers, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is featured in a campaign advertisement for Gov. George E. Pataki. This 30-second advertisement began to be broadcast statewide yesterday.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Chris Mottola</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- On the right side, Mr. Giuliani's head and shoulders fill one panel, as the former mayor, in a dark suit and seated against a dark background, delivers testimonials to the governor's character. On the left, another panel silently shows Mr. Pataki in shirt sleeves, greeting groups of people, mostly children, in the sunny outdoors, smiling, hugging, shaking hands. One oddity is that the side-by-side panels, each shaped like a television screen, leave much of the larger screen black above and below, so that the images of Mr. Pataki's and Mr. Giuliani's faces are rather small.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Giuliani: ''George Pataki, there's a real guy; there's a real man who really cares about people. He's been an excellent governor with regard to giving us a sense of purpose that we didn't have before. He always takes time out to see how you're doing, how you are, how your family is. I think people have always looked at George Pataki as a very honest man, a man who is a real source of strength for our state. I'm proud to call George Pataki my governor. I'm prouder still to call him my friend.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Entirely in the eye of the beholder.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- There is no small irony in using as the governor's pitchman Mr. Giuliani, who crossed party lines to endorse Gov. Mario M. Cuomo over Mr. Pataki in 1994, then clashed repeatedly with Mr. Pataki over the next seven years. But since Sept. 11, Mr. Giuliani has been golden, politically -- though polls suggest the gold is not quite as lustrous as is commonly believed. This sort of warm-and-fuzzy advertisement, without so much as a hint of a fact or issue, is meant to remind voters that they like the governor and feel comfortable with him. For the former mayor, who is said by friends to harbor a continued interest in elective office, the advertisement helps keep him on good terms with a Republican Party that he would need in a future race and that has never quite trusted him. Though Mr. Pataki has already had several television advertisements in this campaign, his advisers say this one represents the start of more or less continuous advertising from now through November.</p>
