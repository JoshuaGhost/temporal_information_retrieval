        <p>The airline industry's rescue squad is at work again.</p>
        <p>The Texas Pacific Group, the private equity firm that took Continental Airlines and America West out of bankruptcy nearly a decade ago, is putting its money behind US Airways. Led by David Bonderman, a former lieutenant of the investor Robert Bass, the firm considers the airline industry deeply cyclical and aims to ride the good times and exit before another slump.</p>
        <p>Credit Suisse First Boston and Bank of America, along with Texas Pacific, have put up a total of $500 million in financing to help keep the airline operating as it reorganizes under the protection of the bankruptcy court. Texas Pacific has also agreed to buy $200 million worth of stock in US Airways when -- and if -- it emerges from bankruptcy, giving it a 38 percent stake in the airline and 5 of the 13 seats on its board.</p>
        <p>Investors in Texas Pacific's funds have done well over the years, though the firm declines to provide its rate of return. Its investment in Oxford Health Plans in the early 1990's looked as if it was going under before the medical insurer's results and its stock sharply rebounded. The firm recently sold its remaining Oxford shares, doubling its money.</p>
        <p>Another winner was Ducati Motor, the Italian motorcycle company.</p>
        <p>The firm's $560 million investment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, has been a loser so far. For its last fiscal year, J. Crew posted a loss of $11 million. Texas Pacific has lost money on ZiLog Inc., a semiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker, which also filed for bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bonderman has a formula for ventures in the airline business. He becomes involved as part of a bankruptcy process at a time when the companies are renegotiating their debt, including the plane lease contracts, bringing the cost of the fleet often below that of most competitors. Negotiating with significantly weakened unions, he sharply cuts the salaries of pilots and other union members. As the economy picks up, the airline's profits rise. Then Texas Pacific begins to cash out.</p>
        <p>Texas Pacific's partners followed that strategy when they invested $450 million in equity and debt in Continental in 1993. A decade later, the partners made 11 times their equity investment in Continental, which nearly filed for bankruptcy a second time soon after they became involved, causing the partners at Texas Pacific to replace management.</p>
        <p>The partners invested $267 million in America West in 1994. That venture produced three times their equity investment of $55 million.</p>
        <p>''Airline investing is a lot about cycles,'' said James G. Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific. ''At the bottom of the cycle, you have a better opportunity to fix an airline.</p>
        <p>''We like contrarian, complicated situations,'' he added.</p>
        <p>With $8 billion under management, Texas Pacific also has investments in Ryanair, a low-cost carrier based in Dublin; the AerFi Group (formerly known as the GPA Group), an aircraft leasing company; and Hotwire, an online travel reservation Web site. In March, the firm announced the purchase of Gate Gourmet, the catering business of the Swissair Group.</p>
        <p>The firm is not currently considering any other investments in the United States airline industry, a spokesman said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The stake in US Airways will be completed only after due diligence is successfully completed, and other investors could outbid Texas Pacific for the equity investment.</p>
        <p>For Texas Pacific, which says it looks for airlines with high costs and good management, it is a comfortable relationship. David N. Siegel, the chief executive of US Airways, was an executive at Continental when Texas Pacific's partners stepped in there, said Richard P. Schifter, a partner at Texas Pacific.</p>
        <p>The reorganization of US Airways should prove relatively uncomplicated in light of recent bankruptcies like WorldCom and Enron, Mr. Schifter said. ''This is much more clear cut.''</p>
        <p>The debt of US Airways consists mainly of aircraft lease financing, and creditors will receive whatever the market dictates those leases to be worth, Mr. Schifter said. At WorldCom, there are billions of dollars in unsecured debts and creditors will be forced to negotiate with one another over their claims.</p>
        <p>Airline turnarounds can be a risky proposition, though. Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier acquired control in 1985 of Trans World Airlines and struggled for years to revive the airline. It ended up filing for bankruptcy three times -- once under Mr. Icahn's watch -- before being acquired by the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, as part of a reorganization last year.</p>
        <p>AIRLINE SHOCK WAVES: MARKET PLACE  Correction:  August 14, 2002, Wednesday  The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about the Texas Pacific Group, which is investing in US Airways, referred imprecisely to its goals. While it has endorsed concessions from unions in some earlier deals, Texas Pacific is not seeking concessions beyond those already being negotiated for US Airways.</p>
        <p>The column also misstated Texas Pacific's investment in America West Airlines. It was $40 million, not $55 million. The column referred incorrectly to the status of the company's investment in AerFi Group; it has sold its stake.</p>
