        <p>After 31 years with the same Gibson-girl hair, Judi Glassenberg wasn't going to wait for her bun to come out ''in globs all over everything'' after she was told in October that she had ovarian cancer. ''Every part of your body that has hair on it, you lose.</p>
        <p>It's very degrading.'' So Glassenberg chose to cut her corn-silk mane before she lost it -- at least then it was ''uplifting.''</p>

        <p>After 31 years with the same Gibson-girl hair, Judi Glassenberg wasn't going to wait for her bun to come out ''in globs all over everything'' after she was told in October that she had ovarian cancer. ''Every part of your body that has hair on it, you lose.</p>
        <p>It's very degrading.'' So Glassenberg chose to cut her corn-silk mane before she lost it -- at least then it was ''uplifting.''</p>
        <p>Glassenberg, 56, admits that growing up, ''you never said 'cancer'; you just whispered, 'the C-word.' '' Cutting her hair in stages let her confront it gradually.</p>
        <p>''Two-foot-long hair falling out in clumps?'' she told herself. ''This isn't for me.'' Two weeks before chemotherapy, she went with her daughter Jacquie to get her first cut since she was a teenager.</p>
        <p>Glassenberg was surprised that she ''rather liked'' her short look. Although an acquaintance's uncharitable quip -- ''Now you're just like every other rose in the garden'' -- haunted her.</p>
        <p>Now in her second round of chemotherapy, Glassenberg says, ''The farthest thing from my mind is my appearance.'' Once her hair grows back, as she hopes it will, she will keep it short.</p>
