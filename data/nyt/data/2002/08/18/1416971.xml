        <p>Two weeks of steady rains unleashed their wrath on Central Europe as the worst floodwaters in recorded history etched ribbons of destruction through the Czech Republic, Austria and Germany and threatened to inundate Slovakia and Hungary by week's end. An ingenious aluminum wall saved Prague's historic Old Town and its medieval Jewish cemetery, but across the roiling brown Vltava, the Baroque palaces of Kampa and Mala Strana were submerged. Whole swathes of countryside became vast brown reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Downstream, a flooded chemical plant threatened to spill tons of mercury and dioxin into the Elbe. By Thursday, waters were covering the heart of Dresden, where curators worked by candlelight to save the collection of the Zwinger Gallery, strapping vast Old Masters to the ceilings.</p>
