        <p>It began in Rome, as so many memorable things in my life have, and with a command. ''You must have a bicycle,'' declared my friend Wendy Artin, a longtime Romana and a painter who travels by bicycle to do her shopping, meet her models and set up her drawing board in front of the ruins and crumbs of antiquity. ''It is the best way to unravel this city, and to master it. Movement changes everything. You'll see.''</p>
        <p>''This city,'' she said. ''Your city, too,'' she might have added, though that would have meant looking into the future, which in Rome -- a place so saturated with the past that you can end up feeling powerfully concentrated in the present -- it is not customary to do.</p>
        <p>Wendy took me by the arm. This was essential, as I was so severely jet-lagged I had become convinced the cobblestones were set in quicksand. She managed to keep me upright as far at the Via del Pellegrino, where she thrust me into Danilo's bicycle shop, a dim, crowded, cluttered cave of a place not far from the Campo de' Fiori.</p>
        <p>It was love at first scent: the grease, the mold, the damp, the rubber from all those deflated tires hanging limply off the walls. And sound: of gently clicking gears and brakes tightened until they squeaked. And touch: of my hands against cool chrome handlebars, my feet on the pedals, my skin against the dry, hot, still Roman air.</p>
        <p>There wasn't a lot of air, at first, because I was riding with my hands clamped to the brakes so that I inched forward, like an old man or a child. On the sidewalk, no less, since I was daunted by the streets, with their mad spurt and whirl of Roman traffic. But after about 10 minutes, I edged off the curb and in between two Vespas; half an hour later I was in the Piazza Venezia, engulfed, fearless.</p>
        <p>That's when it truly began: love. Not at first sight -- I can't claim that -- but at sight, let's say, refreshed. Altered; transformed. The sight of a city I loved and knew, or thought I knew, becoming at once more intimate and more mysterious. Here compressing, here opening up new vistas, new detours, new discoveries.</p>
        <p>And offering (Wendy was right) a sense of mastery: because nothing is as gratifying as easily pedaling distances that on foot and in the summer heat could destroy a man. Or finding that the familiar has undergone a shape-change, merely because you come at it from a different angle. Or even becoming humbled --because humility is a form of mastery, too -- by the city's vastness and recognizing the truth in what Eleanor Clark wrote about Rome 50 years ago: ''You could start anywhere, it really doesn't matter, you will see so little anyway.''</p>
        <p>The bicycle as a great awakener: in Rome I wondered, What would it do to New York? In New York I wondered, How will I find Rome?</p>
        <p>I had come in for a hard landing. I wanted to prolong the ease, the sweetness, the gentility, the beauty, the tastiness; above all the movement.</p>
        <p>In New York I once again found myself stumbling through a haze of jet lag and into a bicycle shop. This one was at Avenue of the Americas and 15th Street, not far from where I live: Metro was its name, and its manager, by some synchronistic stroke, was called Daniel. He sized me up diagnostically and said: ''You're a new rider. You want something safe and durable. You don't want to spend a lot of money so that if it's stolen you won't be upset. Take last year's Trek and some coffee for the jet lag and you'll be fine.''</p>
        <p>I did, and I was. For a moment or two. Then came the conundrum: how to find Rome, or Italy, in Manhattan -- or at least in my neighborhood? How, in the thick of this long, hot summer, to ride my way into the old, the authentic, the atmospheric, the evocative, the spirit-lifting, the Mediterranean?</p>
        <p>Naughty Garibaldi</p>
        <p>I began by visiting the most Italian icon I could think of nearby: Giovanni Turini's statue of Garibaldi in Washington Square. Turini, who volunteered in Garibaldi's Fourth Regiment in 1866, made the sculpture about 20 years later, having received a commission from New York's Italian-American citizens.</p>
        <p>They were no doubt partly celebrating the patriot's strong, if not altogether happy or particularly rooted, connection to the city: in the early 1850's he lived in exile in a cottage (now a small museum) on Staten Island, where he had fled after the collapse of Giuseppe Mazzini's briefly sustained Roman Republic. Here he scratched around trying to support himself, at one point by making candles, until friends eventually arranged for him to take up his trade, seafaring. By 1860 he was back in Italy, capturing Sicily and Naples and leading the unification of the country under Victor Emmanuel.</p>
        <p>In the park people were strolling past the bronze soldier, as ever unaware that he was perpetually about to draw his sword in a commemorative re-enactment of his crusade. A sign nearby reported a good-luck ritual among the N.Y.U. business students: going as far back as the 1960's, apparently, they have been in the habit of inaugurating the school year by tossing a penny at the base of the statue. Alas, no coins were in evidence, nor was there any written confirmation of an old Village joke told to me by a friend: whenever a virgin passes Garibaldi, word has it, he lifts his sword. How long has it been since a Village girl has received Garibaldi's salute? A hundred years.</p>
        <p>The punch line seemed a bit woebegone, a once-racy joke from the 1950's that had lost its daring. But somehow its quaintness set the tone for my next destination, the bookseller S. F. Vanni on West 12th Street, which is as far as I know New York's only exclusive source of Italian publications.</p>
        <p>Say It in Italian</p>
        <p>Vanni is one of the last relics of the genteel, estimable, sometimes slightly eccentric stores and businesses that used to be so typical of the Village neighborhood. I am not thinking so much of the booksellers that until about 20 years ago lined Fourth Avenue (though they are fine examples, too) as much as B. Shackman, the toy and novelty makers and sellers on lower Fifth Avenue; Carl Fischer, the music publishers near Astor Place; Galowitz, the photography suppliers on 13th Street; the Peacock, an Italian coffeehouse on Greenwich Avenue -- the list is surely longer, and quick to bring on a bittersweet melancholy.</p>
        <p>As is Vanni, though in a way that is marginally more sweet than bitter. The shop is one of those places, increasingly rare in this city, that time seems to have passed by. Its musty scent is downright Roman. Some of the books on the shelves are so old their pages are yellowing; others bear the old-fashioned imprint, ''S. F. Vanni Booksellers and Publishers.'' These are mostly language manuals (''Rapid Italian for Students and Tourists'') and bring back a period when well-traveled Americans bothered to learn the language of the country they visited.</p>
        <p>Among those of us who live in the neighborhood, the windows at Vanni are famously puzzling: arranged on what appear to be carpet samples, the books on display, and the dust enveloping them, do not seem to have been touched in a generation. When I asked the fellow minding the store how often the windows were changed, he thought for a moment before answering: ''Practically never. There's no point.''</p>
        <p>''But don't they fade?''</p>
        <p>''We have a particular clientele. They're not fussy. They know we are not Madison Avenue.''</p>
        <p>''Is there a Signor Vanni?''</p>
        <p>''There would have been once, yes.''</p>
        <p>''Does his family own the store now?''</p>
        <p>''I couldn't say.''</p>
        <p>''And you?''</p>
        <p>''I am just on the floor.''</p>
        <p>On the floor: the phrase instantly evoked a New York of elevator boys and seltzer deliveries, gentlewomen in gloves and gentlemen in hats: a New York I have never known, firsthand.</p>
        <p>Thankfully there are still ways to travel back in time, in this city. I next rode on to another old Italian -- or Italo-American -- locale, the Dorato establishment in a town house on West Fourth Street, where Dr. Charles Dorato practices dentistry upstairs and his mother, Fedora, runs an eponymous restaurant downstairs, in a space that has been feeding New Yorkers since 1928.</p>
        <p>Charlie Dorato is the kind of dentist who is an old hand at treating mildly neurotic Village writers: if you chew too hard on your pencil one morning, say, and worry that you've chipped your bottom incisor, he will see you that afternoon, and when you apologize for being, perhaps, slightly psychosomatic, he'll reply, ''No, just psycho,'' before buffing out the microscopic chip.</p>
        <p>His office is packed with a large, idiosyncratic collection of artworks. As though to keep up, his hygienist, Yolanda Feliciano, has papered her room with hundreds, if not thousands, of photographs of her patients' pets (my ''niece,'' Lucy, that sly but highly yappy mutt, among them). Dr. Dorato's aunt, Norma Nannini, sits behind the front desk and speaks to you in New York-inflected Italian at the drop of a buongiorno.</p>
        <p>Chicken Tetrazzini? O.K.</p>
        <p>Downstairs, Fedora Dorato continues, at a vigorous 81, to prepare dinner for her faithful clientele five nights a week, running the restaurant begun in the late 1920's by her father-in-law. Originally it was called Charlie's Garden; in 1952 Fedora and her husband, Henry, took it over, changed its name, hung out what is now a beloved neon sign and pitched the cuisine somewhere between midcentury Italy and midcentury New York, where it remains to this day.</p>
        <p>Homemade manicotti, veal cutlet Milanese, eggplant parmigiana, chicken tetrazzini, eggs à la Russe, icebox cake, spumoni: the menu speaks with a bygone accent, like Aunt Norma and the Florence-born Fedora, who in any event seems less interested in stirring soup pots than tending bar and offering running commentary on her life: ''Remember, my dear, I'm not named for the hat but the 1898 opera by Umberto Giordano. And don't forget my little sister either -- she got her name from Bellini. My parents were very musical, you see.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant is a piece of old New York. The dining room, a favorite among gay men of the pre-Stonewall generation, has walls hung with sun-bleached caricatures and black-and-white head shots of forgotten celebrities. A rotary phone still stands in its own private booth, and the restaurant's number is printed on the menu as a time-defying Chelsea 2-9691. The bar has a telltale angled splice where Fedora's father-in-law extended it in 1932 to fill in the space where a back staircase had led up to a secret speakeasy that did brisk business during Prohibition. Now it's the room where writers (and other people) come to get their teeth fixed, and filled.</p>
        <p>What next? A swing farther downtown, through the last remaining vestiges of the Village and SoHo that still bear the imprint of their Italian immigrant past. This meant Thompson and Sullivan Streets, mostly, where restaurants like Monte's and Rocco have been in business longer than Fedora (1918 and 1922, respectively); where Vesuvio has been baking its simple Italian bread (on Prince Street) long enough to become the subject of its own postcard; and where a relative newcomer -- ''Just refer to me as Alessandro, my place is just 'the sandwich shop' '' -- makes some of the best mozzarella (and, yes, sandwiches) in the city in the back of his convivial, crowded store (on Sullivan, a few doors south of Prince).</p>
        <p>Anchovies in Brine? Sì</p>
        <p>Ah, food: it used to be, when I was leaving Italy, I would fill an empty suitcase with bags of taralucci and chunks of parmigiano, bottles (in bubble wrap) of Tuscan olive oil and packages of dried porcini mushrooms; but then one year I discovered Buon Italia, the all-Italian food merchants in the Chelsea Market on Ninth Avenue, and all of a sudden I stopped having to pay those surcharges on my bags.</p>
        <p>Buon Italia is one of those rare places in New York where, as soon as you walk through the door, you feel as though you've traveled very far from home. I strolled up and down the aisles packed with pasta in every form, dried beans in every variety, tuna under oil and anchovies in brine. I listened to the bubble and hiss of the espresso maker working away at the little bar toward the front. I eavesdropped on conversations, which were as often in Italian as in English. I watched the cooks prepare panini and pesto at Zia Tonia, the kitchen at the back. And I thought, ''If this isn't Italy, it sure comes close.''</p>
        <p>But then I stepped again into the thick of Ninth Avenue on a hot summer day. The faces on the streets were grim and crunched; the asphalt boiled; the drivers' curses were louder than their horns. The city was, plainly, at its stickiest, its most sluggish and sullen, that annual summer nadir when all you want to do is scappare via, or flee.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Afternoon Break</p>
        <p>I mounted my bicycle and, as I began to thread my way though the side streets of the far West Village, I thought about how New York changes and contains everything it takes in, as everything it takes in changes New York. It offers Garibaldi refuge at a key moment in his life, then later adapts his statue for a good luck charm (or an old joke about virgins); it fades the books at Vanni and gives the man ''on the floor'' a New York edge; it absorbs the emigrant Doratos and turns them into dentists and not-quite-Italian New York restaurateurs; it cocoons a place like Buon Italia, but outside the cacophonous, the polyglot and the short-tempered endlessly teem.</p>
        <p>My quest, I reluctantly concluded, was quixotic, unfair to Rome and New York alike. It was time to give up, time to move on.</p>
        <p>But then something unusual happened.</p>
        <p>On a Saturday late last month, a transformer exploded at the Con Ed plant at 14th Street and the East River. No malevolence was involved; no people were hurt; for eight remarkable hours a swath of downtown simply lost its juice. All of it. Subways stopped and elevators froze. Air-conditioners fell silent; drivers, with help from volunteers, behaved; all through the Village, gates came rolling down over shopfronts and doorways. The quiet was familiar. It was the quiet, I quickly realized, of the chiusura, the afternoon timeout that is so restorative a fixture of the Italian workday.</p>
        <p>I carried my bicycle down eight flights of stairs in my building and set off into a neighborhood blissfully, uncharacteristically serene. I rode through the empty streets, where for once no one was selling, no one was barking, no one was in a rush. Where, instead, slowed by the downright Roman heat, calmed by the way time felt on hold, people were actually talking, pausing, lingering. Speaking to strangers; kneeling down to examine babies in their strollers; sipping iced tea at empty cafe tables. Taking a much needed break from all that summer push. The city had had to be unplugged, but -- for one brief afternoon -- I'd found my Roman New York at last.</p>
