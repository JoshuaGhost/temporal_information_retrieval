        <p>It's a long way from Mount Olympus, where the nine Greek muses -- Thalia, Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsichore, Calliope, Urania, Polyhymnia and Clio -- dispensed inspiration to needy artists, to the Hollywood in Albert Brooks's 1999 comedy ''The Muse,'' where Sharon Stone played a very bossy, very mercurial muse-for-hire named Sarah, who services Hollywood bigwigs in return for lots of trinkets from Tiffany's, top-of-the-line accommodations at the Four Seasons Hotel and round-the-clock car service.

        <p>THE LIVES OF THE MUSES  Nine Women &amp; the Artists They Inspired.  By Francine Prose  Illustrated. 416 pages. HarperCollins. $25.95.</p>
        <p>It's a long way from Mount Olympus, where the nine Greek muses -- Thalia, Melpomene, Euterpe, Erato, Terpsichore, Calliope, Urania, Polyhymnia and Clio -- dispensed inspiration to needy artists, to the Hollywood in Albert Brooks's 1999 comedy ''The Muse,'' where Sharon Stone played a very bossy, very mercurial muse-for-hire named Sarah, who services Hollywood bigwigs in return for lots of trinkets from Tiffany's, top-of-the-line accommodations at the Four Seasons Hotel and round-the-clock car service. Both the ancient Greek deities and Sarah, however, were figures meant to embody (or satirize) the mysteries of artistic creation, and both turn out to have little in common with the real-life muses profiled in Francine Prose's fascinating new book, ''The Lives of the Muses.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Prose's nine muses span more than two centuries and represent a variety of muse types, from the art wife to the serial muse (who moves from one artist to another); from the unattainable muse on the pedestal to the spin-doctor muse, practiced in the craft of promotion. Their stories reveal as much about relationships between men and women as they do about the roots of creativity, and they raise questions about the old stereotypes of ''the creative, productive, active male'' and ''the passive female, at once worshiped and degraded.''</p>
        <p>''Artists rarely create for the muse, to win or keep the Muse's love and admiration,'' Ms. Prose writes, ''but rather for themselves, for the world, and for the more inchoate and unquantifiable imperatives of art itself. Their muses are merely the instruments that raise the emotional and erotic temperature high enough, churn up the weather in a way that may speed and facilitate the artist's labors.'' The one example in this book, which suggests that ''the roles of inspired and inspirer, artist and muse, can be divided and shared between a man and a woman'' is that of Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine, who were genuine partners in collaboration, two artists working together to create something neither could have created alone.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Ms. Prose's choice of muses in this book is extremely arbitrary. Why, the reader wonders, were women like Alma Mahler, Zelda Fitzgerald, Camille Claudel and Françoise Gilot not profiled? But the portraits she does include are smart, sympathetic and keenly observed, pithy biographical portraits that are gems of concision and insight.</p>
        <p>Writing like an old-fashioned omniscient narrator in a novel, Ms. Prose freely comments on her subjects' lives and works, explicating emotional dynamics, assessing vulnerabilities and evaluating behavior. She sees a connection between the chilly formalism of Edward Weston's photographs and his controlling treatment of his muse and later wife, Charis Harris; and she discerns a parallel between Dante Gabriel Rossetti's self-conscious, theatrical art and his willful determination to treat his longtime mistress Elizabeth Siddal as a latter-day reincarnation of Dante's famous muse, Beatrice. She suggests that Lou Andreas-Salomé's intellect and gift for sympathetic understanding, combined with a gift for seduction, made her ''the ideal muse,'' for a succession of men, including Nietzsche, Rilke and Freud. And she argues that the story of Lee Miller -- who began as Man Ray's model and assistant and went on to win renown of her own as a photographer during World War II -- shows that a talented muse can sometimes make the difficult transition to becoming an artist.</p>
        <p>It is Ms. Prose's conviction that every historical period ''endows the muse with the qualities, virtues and flaws that the epoch and its artists need and deserve,'' and it's clear that the muses in this volume have been chosen quite deliberately to illustrate this thesis. ''In 18th-century London,'' she writes, ''where Samuel Johnson's fame relied on a conjunction of an eloquent prose style and dazzling social skills, Mrs. Hester Thrale -- a sharp-tongued, lively, intelligent woman married to a rich brewer who gave lavish dinner parties at which his wife and Dr. Johnson could talk -- functioned as the muse of literature and of conversation. The Victorian Muses -- Alice Liddell, Lizzie Siddal -- come to us trailing clouds of innocence, naïveté and repression, as well as various unsavory Victorian fantasies about children and young women.''</p>
        <p>As for more modern muses like Gala Dalí, who stage-managed the career of her husband, Salvador, with an eye toward accruing money and fame, and Yoko Ono, who assumed control over the business affairs of her husband, John Lennon, they seem peculiarly suited to an age attuned to ''the commercial benefits of commodifying the celebrity artist.''</p>
        <p>For that matter, the concept of a muse has become increasingly outdated -- at odds with both modern feminism and Freudian thought, as the dance critic Arlene Croce has pointed out -- and subject to comical send-ups, like the one in Mr. Brooks's movie. ''Perhaps psychology has convinced us that the human psyche is too complex to derive something so tough and enduring as art from something so fragile and transitory as love,'' Ms. Prose writes. Indeed, she suggests that our culture has perhaps reached the point where ''nearly anything -- geography, ambition, expensive tastes, an abusive childhood, poverty -- seems a more probable motivation for making art than the promptings of longing or love.''</p>
