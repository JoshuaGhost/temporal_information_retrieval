        <p>A State Senate district in the Bronx that started the day without any candidates on the Democratic primary ballot ended the day with two, after an appeals court restored the incumbent, Pedro Espada Jr., and the party organization backed the candidacy of the Rev. Ruben Diaz Sr., a city councilman.</p>
        <p>In selecting Mr. Diaz, who was elected to the Council last year, the Bronx Democratic Party replaced the candidate it had previously supported, Raysa Castillo. Earlier this week, a State Supreme Court justice ruled that Ms. Castillo be removed from the ballot because she did not meet the residency requirements. The decision to support Mr. Diaz came as party leaders rushed to meet a midnight deadline.</p>
        <p>For weeks, there was an abundance of confusion about who would wind up on the ballot. Mr. Espada -- the incumbent senator who announced earlier this year that he would become a Republican, but has not yet done so -- had been removed from the ballot by a State Supreme Court justice who ruled that the Democratic Party had been within its rights to purge him from its rolls.</p>
        <p>But with his successful appeal of his ballot removal, the stage is set for a heated political battle in the less than three weeks before the Sept. 10 primary. Both Mr. Espada and Mr. Diaz are known to have the resources to wage serious campaigns. Mr. Espada, who also operates a large health center with hundreds of employees in the Bronx, typically puts together a formidable campaign organization. Mr. Diaz, too, is well known in the borough. He is a Pentecostal minister who has been politically active, and before joining the Council ran several nonprofit centers that provided services for older Bronx residents.</p>
        <p>The Democratic organization took the unusual step of seeking to remove Mr. Espada from its rolls. It pointed out that Mr. Espada had publicly announced that he was becoming a Republican and that he had begun sitting in the conference of the Republican majority in Albany.</p>
        <p>The party had selected Ms. Castillo, a lawyer, to run in the heavily Democratic 32nd Senate District, which covers Mott Haven and Soundview in the Bronx. But Ms. Castillo was removed from the ballot, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada called yesterday's 4-to-1 decision by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court ''a great victory for this community.''</p>
        <p>''I know it will not be easy,'' Mr. Diaz said of the campaign. ''I have to rush to do something that I had not thought about before. But I am confident that the community will respond and support me.''</p>
        <p>The race will have undertones of a family rivalry because the two candidates' sons have run against each other. In 1996, Mr. Espada's son, Pedro Gautier Espada, ran against Ruben Diaz Jr. for an Assembly seat. While the younger Mr. Espada won that race in a special election, Mr. Diaz's son won the position for a full term later that year.</p>
