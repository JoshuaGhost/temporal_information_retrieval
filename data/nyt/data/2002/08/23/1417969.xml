        <p>Bush Widens Exemptions On Foreign Steel Products  The Bush administration excluded more than 178 imported steel products from steep tariffs it imposed in the spring, chipping away at an effort to protect the ailing United States steel industry. The decision, which infuriated American producers, means that nearly one-quarter of all foreign imports are now free to enter the country under normal rules.</p>
        <p>The decision was the latest twist in President Bush's on-again, off-again commitment to free trade. Though administration officials justified their action on dry and technical grounds, it showed that the White House has been forced to backpedal on its protection efforts, in part because American companies say they cannot get specialty products except from overseas.
