        <p>The new French melodrama ''How I Killed My Father'' is as dry as summer cornmeal. Here, it's as if the director Anne Fontaine is trying to say that every nationality -- and generation -- needs its own austere and mechanical ''Ordinary People.'' It is just as grimly and pointedly plotted.</p>
        <p>''Father'' opens with Jean-Luc (Charles Berling), a gerontologist, in conversation with one of his patients, an older man who's also a new father. Idly listening, he nods while hearing the patient's fear: that he'll be irrelevant by the time his son is grown.</p>
        <p>Soon, Jean-Luc will encounter another old man who's unnecessary: his own father, Maurice (Michel Bouquet), who materializes with a stoic expression fixed on his wise, wizened face. But the smugly professional gerontologist's evenhandedness soon dissipates. Jean-Luc's visage now reflects mild panic. The old man, who's also a doctor, abandoned him and his younger brother, Patrick (Stéphane Guillon), when they were boys.</p>
        <p>Patrick was so young at the time that he has no memory of their father. But Jean-Luc does. Rage, though barely suppressed, enters the gerontologist's usually relaxed existence.</p>
        <p>Intrigues emerge in Jean-Luc's life, too. We learn that he has been keeping his wife, Isa (Natacha Régnier), at arm's length, toying with her desire to start a family. It's because he's afraid of having children -- even as he earlier offered sage, drab advice to the older client who felt his son would become a stranger in his house and eventually replace him. Now, Jean-Luc has to deal with his own inadequacies -- a physician unable to heal himself.</p>
        <p>Gerontology lends itself to the plot machinery, as Jean-Luc admits that he's just making money while ministering to the sagging skins of Versailles' aging rich. But this doctor is an exploiter in other parts of his life as well. Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet. The child has become the father and is ruining all of his relationships through the same lack of commitment that his parent displayed years earlier.</p>
        <p>Lumbering back into Jean-Luc's existence, his father speeds the end of his son's emotional attachments; he's the parent nobody wants. Maurice lingers around Jean-Luc's life like a plague, dispensing intrusive advice that slowly unravels the cocoon of lies and deceptions that Jean-Luc has woven around his world. It turns out that the ingratiating Patrick, a stand-up comic of modest talent, can't make a living at his chosen profession and is kept on his brother's payroll as a chauffeur. The single mother and office manager (Amira Casar) is used by Jean-Luc for sex, though he says he cares for her.</p>
        <p>But in its own morose, heavy-handed terms, ''How I Killed My Father'' -- the title is metaphorical -- is effective. The austere functionality imposes a dramatic climate control, keeping the picture's atmosphere cool and airless. Paternity carries a congenital threat: fathers and sons are bound to cause psychological damage to each other. Jean-Luc will learn that what he had told his patient is balefully true: fathers and sons are strangers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bouquet offers a limpid and deft performance, his quick shifts of emotion creating a chill all their own. Opting for a light, benign sense of menace, he heightens the scenes he's in, providing a contrast to the spartan, plain-spoken minimalism of the film. Ms. Fontaine shows refinement in her direction of this obvious psychodrama. But taste and restraint aren't always assets. She's determined to make her points, although we know what she's getting at long before she shows us.</p>
        <p>Unable to depart from the course set for them, the actors do what they can. Mainly, they're flesh-and-blood pawns. The rigor of Ms. Fontaine and her co-writer Jacques Fieschi's aims doesn't leave much room for the cast to embellish. And with the exception of Mr. Bouquet, who gets to sound more than one note, all they can do is show their misery. Such willfulness becomes a form of torture, too, and not just for the actors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bouquet's mastery and equanimity provides him many levels of resonance; he's also used to years of underplaying from his association with Claude Chabrol, whose mixture of Hitchcock and family dynamics is clearly an influence on Ms. Fontaine's work.</p>
        <p>Told in flashback, ''How I Killed My Father,'' which opens today in Manhattan, is a kind of murder mystery, but eventually the only victim is the audience's interest -- the picture is uncompromising and inauspicious.</p>
        <p>HOW I KILLED MY FATHER</p>
