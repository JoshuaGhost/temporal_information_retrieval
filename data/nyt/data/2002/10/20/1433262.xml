      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>LATELY, Alfredo Jaar, the Chilean-born installation artist, has been practicing the art of renunciation. For a 1995 exhibition in New York, he famously sealed his photographs of the Rwanda genocide inside black boxes. Since then he has experimented with image deprivation as a kind of visual homeopathy. ''Our society is blind,'' he said in a recent interview in his Manhattan loft. ''We have lost our ability to be affected by imagery.''</p>
        <p>A new version of an installation by Mr. Jaar that was shown this summer at Documenta 11 in Kassel, Germany, is on view at Galerie Lelong in Chelsea through November. Called ''Lament of the Images,'' the show begins in a dark room with three short wall texts whose letters are cut into back-lighted panels. The panels provide the room's only light, so that viewers are literally illuminated by the words. The subjects range from Nelson Mandela to Bill Gates to Afghanistan. (The last text is about the United States military's blocking commercial satellite imagery of Afghanistan during the war there.) An adjacent room contains only a rectangle of searing white light the size of a movie screen. At Documenta, Mr. Jaar saw that many viewers, drawn by the light, stopped to read the texts only on their way out, the quietly scathing words serving as a chastening sort of refuge.</p>

        <p>A new version of an installation by Mr. Jaar that was shown this summer at Documenta 11 in Kassel, Germany, is on view at Galerie Lelong in Chelsea through November. Called ''Lament of the Images,'' the show begins in a dark room with three short wall texts whose letters are cut into back-lighted panels. The panels provide the room's only light, so that viewers are literally illuminated by the words. The subjects range from Nelson Mandela to Bill Gates to Afghanistan. (The last text is about the United States military's blocking commercial satellite imagery of Afghanistan during the war there.) An adjacent room contains only a rectangle of searing white light the size of a movie screen. At Documenta, Mr. Jaar saw that many viewers, drawn by the light, stopped to read the texts only on their way out, the quietly scathing words serving as a chastening sort of refuge.</p>
        <p>In a third dark room is a new component: two light tables, one on the floor and the other suspended upside down from the ceiling, their glowing surfaces inches apart. Periodically, the top table rises and descends. In the brief intervals when it's overhead, viewers again become illuminated by the art. Despite the simplicity of this work's artistic language -- the almost biblical use of light and darkness -- Mr. Jaar is a little worried about its accessibility. ''I'm taking a risk trying to communicate without text,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But then he's not unrealistic about the effectiveness of speaking politically through art. ''I am a little skeptical about the responsibility of the art world to these issues,'' he said, but it ''offers a space that's not available anywhere else. We should use every available space.''</p>
        <p>True to his word, he devotes considerable time to public projects. Whatever the site, Mr. Jaar's uncanny ability to throw perception into a state of emergency makes a point anyone can get: sometimes art is less a thing to look at than a way to see.</p>
