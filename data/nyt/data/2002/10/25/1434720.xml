      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A Mantegna Is Available</p>
        <p>''Descent Into Limbo,'' the last painting by the Italian Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna still in private hands and an image familiar to museumgoers, will be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on Jan. 23. Painted around 1492 and measuring only about 15 by 16 inches, the work shows Jesus going down into limbo to liberate the souls of the righteous dead.</p>
        <p>Mantegnas rarely come up at auction. In 1985, Christie's in London sold ''Adoration of the Magi'' to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $10.4 million, at the time a record for a painting at auction. A year later, Sotheby's Monaco sold Mantegna's ''Holy Family With St. Elizabeth and St. John the Baptist'' for $2.4 million. The painting is now at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth. Sotheby's estimates ''Descent Into Limbo'' will sell for $20 million to $30 million.</p>
        <p>While the auction house won't identify the seller, any literature about the artist lists the owner as Barbara Piasecka Johnson. An internationally known collector of old master paintings who moved from Princeton, N.J., to Monaco several years ago, she inherited around $300 million from her husband, J. Seward Johnson Sr., the son of the founder of the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical company, who died in 1983.</p>
        <p>The painting has been featured in exhibitions in the United States and abroad. In 1992 it was part of a major show of the artist's work at the Metropolitan Museum and the Royal Academy in London. In 1988 the Met made it the centerpiece of a mini-exhibition that included prints and drawings related to it from the 15th, 18th and 19th centuries. Most recently, it was on view at the Frick Collection, where it hung for two years until its removal in August.</p>
        <p>What makes the painting so compelling is its composition. Jesus is depicted from the back leaning on his staff at the edge of the cave in a way that instantly draws the viewer into the scene and creates an air of mystery. On his left are four figures, including Adam and Eve, and to the right is an old man hunched toward him.</p>
        <p>''To my mind, this painting encapsulates everything that's great about Mantegna,'' said Christopher Apostle, director of old master paintings for Sotheby's in New York. ''It shows his genius in terms of a narrative and the way he evokes both motion and emotion.''</p>
        <p>Old master paintings experts say Ms. Johnson has been talking about selling the painting for quite some time now. It was offered to the Frick, they say, but the asking price was too high. Samuel Sachs II, director of the Frick, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson's decision to sell the painting at auction is not unusual. Over the years she has bought and sold works at Sotheby's and Christie's, and she is known to have had rocky relationships with both auction houses at different times. But Sotheby's wasn't forced to compete for ''Descent Into Limbo,'' experts there said, and that is unusual, given the competitive climate between the two companies. Asked if Ms. Johnson was given any financing, Mr. Apostle said, ''We have no financial interest in this picture at this moment.''</p>
        <p>As is customary when an auction house gets a painting of such importance, it will be sent to major art capitals for viewing. ''Descent Into Limbo'' will be at Sotheby's offices in Paris from Nov. 25 to 27, in Milan from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2, in London from Dec. 8 to 11 and New York from Jan. 17 to 22.</p>
        <p>Mr. Apostle said the painting might also go to Mantua the first week of December; Mantegna was the court artist for Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, there in the mid-1450's. The place has yet to be determined.</p>
        <p>Heading for Venice 2003</p>
        <p>The installation artist Fred Wilson is to represent the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale. Known for site-specific pieces that deconstruct museum ideology, Mr. Wilson's work often explores issues of race and ethnicity.</p>
        <p>A MacArthur Fellow who lives in New York, Mr. Wilson was selected by the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, a partnership of the National Endowment for the Arts, the State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts that helps choose artists for major international exhibitions like the biennales in Venice, SÃ£o Paulo and Cairo.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Goncharov, the public art curator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge, Mass., will be the commissioner for the United States Pavilion. Ms. Goncharov and Mr. Wilson have worked together for years. In 1993 Ms. Goncharov served as the curator for ''Re:Claiming Egypt,'' his installation at the fourth Cairo International Biennale. His work is currently on view at the Children's Museum in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>As always with an announcement of this sort, dealers, other artists and auction house experts are not shy about voicing opinions. While some people think Mr. Wilson is a sound choice, others expressed dismay, saying that his brand of political conceptual art seems like a curious throwback to the theory-laden art world of the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Selling Artists' Books</p>
        <p>Printed Matter, founded 26 years ago by the artists Carl AndrÃ©, Sol LeWitt and Lucy Lippard as a place to produce and sell artists' books, has formed a partnership with the Whitney Museum of American Art. The two institutions will together put out books and publications by both established and emerging artists. Besides cooperating in marketing efforts, Printed Matter will sell the books at its Chelsea space, and the Whitney will have them for sale at its museum bookstore. Their publications will also be available from their Web sites, www.printedmatter.org and www.whitney.org. They hope to form a joint site.</p>
        <p>The initial partnership will include projects by artists like Vija Celmins, Rita McBride, Ed Ruscha, Jonathan Seliger and Kim Sooja.</p>
