        <p>The video game maker Electronic Arts, bolstered by strong sales of its flagship game, John Madden Football, reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded estimates of Wall Street analysts. The company reported earnings of 34 cents a share, double the consensus projection of analysts. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., said it sold three million copies of the Madden game in the quarter, a not totally unexpected figure, but still noteworthy given that a video game is considered a hit if it sells in excess of 500,000 copies. The company raised its estimates for how it will perform in the current quarter.</p>
