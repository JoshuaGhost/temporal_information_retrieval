        <p>Q.  Does water boiled in a microwave have the same germ-killing abilities as old-fashioned boiled water? Does chicken cooked all the way through in the microwave get hot enough to kill salmonella?</p>
        <p>A.  Because of the chances of uneven heating in a microwave and other factors, the answers are tricky, said Dr. Kathryn J. Boor, associate professor of food science at Cornell.</p>
        <p>The germicidal strength of anything, be it hot water or disinfectant, depends on temperature, concentration (for chemicals) and time, she said. Water boiled in the microwave is less likely to be hot enough long enough to kill germs outside it, though pathogens in the water would be killed as it came to a boil.</p>

        <p>Q.  Does water boiled in a microwave have the same germ-killing abilities as old-fashioned boiled water? Does chicken cooked all the way through in the microwave get hot enough to kill salmonella?</p>
        <p>A.  Because of the chances of uneven heating in a microwave and other factors, the answers are tricky, said Dr. Kathryn J. Boor, associate professor of food science at Cornell.</p>
        <p>The germicidal strength of anything, be it hot water or disinfectant, depends on temperature, concentration (for chemicals) and time, she said. Water boiled in the microwave is less likely to be hot enough long enough to kill germs outside it, though pathogens in the water would be killed as it came to a boil.</p>
        <p>Microwaved water heats to 212 degrees quickly but also cools quickly because it is likely to be a small volume, she explained. A pot of water slowly and evenly coming to a boil over a conventional heat source stays hotter longer and ''has more thermal destructive capability,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for chicken, the only way to check that it reaches the right heat to kill salmonella is with a thermometer, and even that is chancy, Dr. Boor said, because of the cold spots frequently seen in microwaved food. To be safer, she said, cook raw meat or chicken using a recipe tested for the microwave that includes some standing time, so the heat can distribute evenly. ''This increases the chances for thorough heating dramatically,'' Dr. Boor said.</p>
