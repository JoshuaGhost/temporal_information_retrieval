        <p>North Korea said on Monday that Washington had approached the talks with a "hard-line policy of hostility."</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a heated reaction to its first substantive discussions with the Bush administration, North Korea said today that Washington had approached the talks with a ''hard-line policy of hostility.''</p>
        <p>The United States was also accused of seeking to ''bring North Korea to its knees by force and high-handed practices.''</p>
        <p>The comments were made public after the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, James A. Kelly, ended a visit to North Korea on Saturday. He described the visit as ''frank but useful,'' which in diplomatic terms usually suggests limited progress.</p>
        <p>The impression that the talks were difficult was heightened by Mr. Kelly's refusal to take questions during a stopover in South Korea and his cancellation of a news conference in Tokyo the next day.</p>
        <p>In a response to the North Korean comments today, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said that although Washington was committed to talks with North Korea, serious difficulties remained.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher said Mr. Kelly had ''raised, in a frank manner, our concerns on a full range of issues, including weapons of mass destruction, missile-development programs, missile exports, North Korea's threatening conventional force posture, human rights failings and the dire humanitarian situation.''</p>
        <p>The two countries issued their statements as reports emerged in Japan that North Korea was considering redeploying some troops and conventional weapons along the border with South Korea. Mr. Boucher said he could not confirm the reports, which quoted Russian diplomats as saying that North Korea was discussing the withdrawal of 20,000 to 50,000 troops from the border.</p>
        <p>Although modest in scale, such a move would represent an important step toward satisfying a Bush administration demand.</p>
        <p>North Korea has also taken steps in recent weeks to improve its relations with Japan and South Korea. In September, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, received the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, for the first summit meeting between the countries. During that meeting, North Korea apologized for a series of kidnappings of Japanese citizens in the late 1970's and early 1980's, and pledged to abide by international agreements on nuclear weapons development.</p>
        <p>This month, Japan and North Korea are scheduled to resume long-stalled talks aimed at establishing diplomatic relations.</p>
        <p>Today, North Korea also called for the resumption of ministerial-level discussions with South Korea.</p>
