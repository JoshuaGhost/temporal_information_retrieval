        <p>Detroit loves a good brawl between automakers, and it looks as if one is brewing between Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, and Robert Lutz, the General Motors vice chairman.</p>
        <p>The tetchiness began a couple of weeks ago, when Mr. Lutz was quoted by a German newspaper as questioning why Chrysler was promoting a seven-year, 70,000-mile warranty on its vehicles. ''With quality as it is at Chrysler today, I wonder why they did that,'' Mr. Lutz was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lutz was not available to comment. But a G.M. spokesman, Brian S. Akre, said the quotation, interpreted by the newspaper as criticism, was actually meant as a compliment. He said Mr. Lutz, who served as Chrysler's vice chairman until retiring in 1999, had intended to imply that Chrysler wasn't in the same weak position as Hyundai, the Korean automaker, which introduced a 10-year, 10,000-mile warranty a few years ago to reassure consumers that they could trust its products.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the comment touched a nerve at Chrysler. In a discussion last week of the company's two-year turnaround effort, Mr. Zetsche said in an interview that he preferred Chrysler's thorough pace instead of the faster, flashier approach that G.M. has adopted in overhauling its lineup since Mr. Lutz came on board last year.</p>
        <p>''You create more buzz if you hire Bob Lutz,'' Mr. Zetsche said, ''but you create more change if you adopt a program like this one.''</p>
