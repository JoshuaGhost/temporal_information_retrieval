        <p>The Philip Morris Companies reported yesterday that third-quarter earnings increased, largely on the strength of sales in foreign markets. But domestic business continued to show signs of weakness as cigarette taxes rose sharply in more than a dozen states and the proliferation of cheaper brands hurt sales of higher-priced products like Marlboro.</p>
        <p>The company said it would stand by its projections of earnings-per-share growth of 3 to 5 percent for 2002, and predicted earnings would increase 8 to 10 percent in 2003.</p>

        <p>The Philip Morris Companies reported yesterday that third-quarter earnings increased, largely on the strength of sales in foreign markets. But domestic business continued to show signs of weakness as cigarette taxes rose sharply in more than a dozen states and the proliferation of cheaper brands hurt sales of higher-priced products like Marlboro.</p>
        <p>The company said it would stand by its projections of earnings-per-share growth of 3 to 5 percent for 2002, and predicted earnings would increase 8 to 10 percent in 2003.</p>
        <p>Net income in the quarter rose to $4.36 billion, or $2.06 a share, an increase of 87 percent from income of $2.33 billion, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. The latest results included a gain of about $1.7 billion from the sale of the Miller Brewing Company.</p>
        <p>Excluding that gain and other special items, Philip Morris posted earnings of $2.7 billion, or $1.26 a share, up just over 5 percent from $2.57 billion, or $1.16 a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Revenue decreased 1.7 percent, to $19.9 billion, from $20.25 billion.</p>
        <p>The results, which were in line with Wall Street expectations, were predictable; the company had revised its forecast in September.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to characterize this as a positive report when the company is losing share at retail, and the premium-discount mix is slipping,'' said Robert T. Campagnino, a Prudential analyst. ''The data points were certainly not positive; however, it's information that I don't think that the market didn't have already.''</p>
        <p>Philip Morris reported strong sales abroad, but for much of the third quarter its weak spot was domestic business. Operating income at Philip Morris USA declined 3.7 percent in the quarter, to $1.5 billion. Shipping volume fell 6 percent, to 49.4 billion units, from the third quarter of 2001.</p>
        <p>The company's share of premium cigarette sales declined 0.1 percent. Its share of all cigarette sales, which had fallen to 49 percent of the market in July, rose slightly.</p>
        <p>Since 1998, discount cigarette brands have made significant gains because major companies have raised prices to offset expenses related to their legal settlement with a number of states. In addition, increases in excise taxes on cigarettes in several states have helped generic brands siphon customers from Philip Morris.</p>
        <p>In time, analysts said, smokers will probably return to more expensive brands. But for now, major tobacco companies are expected to continue to see a decline in sales.</p>
        <p>''People are still smoking,'' said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''I don't think overall consumption has been that impacted. It's been a channel shift and a product shift. People are buying their cigarettes from different places, and they may be different types.''</p>
        <p>To prop up sales, Philip Morris increased prices and spent heavily on promotions and discounts. Dinyar S. Devitre, the chief financial officer, said Philip Morris expected to spend more than $600 million on promotions in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''We always have to, sort of, almost experiment with this,'' Mr. Devitre said yesterday. ''We will obviously take our foot slightly off the accelerator from time to time, and we just have to wait and see how Marlboro reacts.''</p>
        <p>The company, which said its settlement payments would decrease next year, is hoping that a larger domestic sales force will help it compete with the discounters.</p>
        <p>Outside the United States, its operating income rose 8 percent, to $1.6 billion, because of higher pricing, lower costs and favorable currency exchange rates. Volume increased 2.3 percent, to 187.8 billion units, because of robust sales in Europe.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that although Philip Morris's domestic business had been a cause of concern, the company performed well in a difficult economy. The future, they suggested, is less certain.</p>
        <p>David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst at Morgan Stanley, said it was good that Philip Morris was starting to see some growth in its overall market share, ''but they are spending to get it.''</p>
        <p>''The worst possible outcome,'' he said, ''would be if they were spending aggressively and not getting any growth.''</p>
        <p>In trading ysterday, Philip Morris stock rose $1.70, to $40.30.</p>
