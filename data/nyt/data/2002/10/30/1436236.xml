        <p>Kafka was a lawyer.</p>
        <p>That fact got the discussion started on a recent afternoon in a sunny seminar room at the New York University School of Law, where 17 law students and 2 professors gather every week for a sort of book club, for credit, in a class called Law and Literature.</p>
        <p>''I can't say he liked being a lawyer,'' Catharine R. Stimpson, the dean of the university's graduate school of arts and sciences, told the students. ''I can't say he liked law school. Any alienation law students might feel is mimicked in Kafka's interior experiences.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Gillers, the vice dean of the university's law school, chimed in.</p>
        <p>''The curriculum he studied at law school included Roman law, Austro-Hungarian statutory law, common law, administrative law, criminal law, commercial law and international law,'' he said. ''Some of it was quite similar to what we study.''</p>
        <p>And some of it was not. Law and literature courses, which are now taught in about 40 percent of American law schools, are a recent innovation. Their place in the curriculum has not met with universal approval, and even the field's supporters sometimes have a hard time articulating a pedagogical rationale.</p>
        <p>There are nods to the value of cultivated taste, to a deep understanding of the human condition and to the relationship between good books and good writing. But many proponents of the law-and-literature movement cite another reason.</p>
        <p>''One of the natural urges of even serious folks like law professors and law students is to have a good time every once in a while,'' said Richard Weisberg, a professor at Cardozo Law School and one of the field's founders. ''There is the sheer delight of stories.''</p>
        <p>Professor Gillers agreed. ''What could be more fun than reading novels and getting paid for it and getting credit for it?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>On another level, such courses represent an effort to inject discussions of ethics and values into a curriculum that is sometimes criticized for being too narrow.</p>
        <p>''Within the law school environment, I am convinced that there is no better medium to teach the individual law student about professional responsibility than stories,'' Professor Weisberg said.</p>
        <p>The great skeptic in the field is Richard A. Posner, a federal appeals court judge in Chicago. Judge Posner is usually associated with the field of law and economics, which contends that economics can help provide answers to many legal questions.</p>
        <p>''Lawyers and judges will not become better people,'' he wrote, ''by trolling in literature for ethical insights.''</p>
        <p>To the frustration of the field's proponents, Judge Posner's book-length critique, ''Law and Literature,'' is the most frequently assigned nonfiction book in such classes and shadows any discussion of the field. The book has little good to say about the usual rationales for studying literature instead of torts, but it does concede that lawyers could use a lesson or two in straightforward, stylish writing.</p>
        <p>The ''emerging law and literature canon,'' according to a 1995 report by Elizabeth Villiers Gemmette of a survey of 84 law schools with such classes, includes five books assigned at 20 or more of the schools: ''Billy Budd,'' by Herman Melville; ''Measure for Measure'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'' by William Shakespeare; ''The Stranger,'' by Albert Camus; and ''Antigone,'' by Sophocles.</p>
        <p>The N.Y.U. seminar's syllabus is more eclectic. It includes some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, works by and about Oscar Wilde, and ''Anatomy of a Murder'' by Robert Traver.</p>
        <p>Last week's assignment was ''The Trial,'' Franz Kafka's account of the mysterious proceedings brought against Joseph K., a banker seemingly guilty of nothing more than self-importance and thoughtlessness. It is No. 6 on Ms. Gemmette's list.</p>
        <p>The class had been given a perverse writing assignment. Students were told to imagine themselves as lawyers advising Joseph K. on how to obtain clemency in the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Professor Stimpson said there was ''an interesting uniformity in the papers.''</p>
        <p>''Joseph K. was advised again and again to eat humble pie,'' she said. ''None of you used the word 'grovel,' but the word did come to mind.''</p>
        <p>Florence M. Kramer, a student, gave her client this advice in her paper: ''If you were completely innocent,'' she wrote, ''you wouldn't be a man.''</p>
        <p>Eryn A. Bingle was in the minority. She advised Joseph K. to flee.</p>
        <p>''From a legal ethics standpoint, you might have an action against me,'' she said in class, to laughter. ''I surely would have gotten him killed, I think.''</p>
        <p>The force of Kafka's work in the actual world of law is undeniable and rising, Professor Gillers said. The term Kafkaesque did not appear in any reported court decision before 1970. In the next decade, judges used it 26 times. It was used more than 100 in each subsequent decade, often in a way that trivializes or misrepresents Kafka's work.</p>
        <p>Justice Antonin Scalia, for instance, in dissenting in a case allowing a disabled golfer to ride in a golf cart, called the majority's reasoning Kafkaesque.</p>
        <p>Other uses of the term, Professor Gillers said, seem more fitting.</p>
        <p>The Louisiana Supreme Court used the term in requiring that a translator be provided for a Brazilian citizen accused of rape who said he spoke only Portuguese. The alternative, the court said, was ''a Kafkaesque specter of an incomprehensible ritual which may terminate in punishment.''</p>
        <p>Students who did summer work in the offices of prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers said ''The Trial'' had a documentary quality. It captured, they said, the pressure the justice system placed on bewildered defendants to plead guilty.</p>
        <p>''In terms of seeing how problematic the system is, it's definitely reality,'' Sara K. White said.</p>
        <p>One parallel to the real-world legal system, she wrote in her paper, was in an insistence on contrition.</p>
        <p>''Refusal to accept guilt is customarily seen as lack of remorse,'' she wrote, ''translating into higher sentences and a reduced chance of parole.'' She noted that some of the men accused in the gang rape of the Central Park jogger, whose guilt has been called into question by D.N.A. evidence, were treated more harshly by the legal system for this reason.</p>
        <p>Judge Posner is critical of those who would find insights about the actual functioning of the justice system in Kafka. ''It is like reading 'Animal Farm' as a tract on farm management,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Allison Podell, one of the 14 women in the class and an aspiring professional writer, said in an interview that the course had inspired her. Her Kafka paper took the form of a short play.</p>
        <p>''These books are about the fundamental questions of justice,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She was asked why she thought only three men had enrolled in the course.</p>
        <p>''Most of the men that I know don't want to waste their time,'' she said. ''Most of my guy friends who want to pursue a career in corporate law don't want to take their eye off the ball.''</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the class, Professor Stimpson asked a question: ''How many of you have ever been stuck in a truly horrendous system?''</p>
        <p>''Law school,'' several students murmured.</p>
