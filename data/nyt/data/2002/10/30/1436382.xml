        <p>New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Science and the University of Cape Town in South Africa announced last week that they would work together on the issue of diversity, with special attention to the AIDS problem. They will run exchange programs for graduate students and professors, cooperate on research and sponsor joint conferences, including one in New York in April called ''Who Owns Diversity?'' and another in Cape Town in June on corporations and diversity. CATHARINE R. STIMPSON, the dean of N.Y.U.'s Graduate School of Arts and Science, said the universities hoped to build ''a model which will show two great universities working together on problems that we must solve if we are to survive.''</p>
