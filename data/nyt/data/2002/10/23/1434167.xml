        <p>A PINK Thunderbird, especially the '57, with its sleek, sweeping lines culminating in the subtle fins that make this sweetheart of vintage American cars appear to be flying down the highway even when it's parked, was born to be driven by the gum-snapping bad girl of a 1950's teen flick. At least, that's what I always thought.</p>
        <p>So in the throes of a second adolescence -- which has a promising start on being more ill-advised than the first -- I bought me a dusk-rose bad-girl car, a show winner with two tops (hard and soft), and (purportedly) power everything, online for $44,500. Adding to the car's ample advertised charms and potential investment value was a claim that she might have once been owned by Conway Twitty, the late country-western singer.

        <p>A PINK Thunderbird, especially the '57, with its sleek, sweeping lines culminating in the subtle fins that make this sweetheart of vintage American cars appear to be flying down the highway even when it's parked, was born to be driven by the gum-snapping bad girl of a 1950's teen flick. At least, that's what I always thought.</p>
        <p>So in the throes of a second adolescence -- which has a promising start on being more ill-advised than the first -- I bought me a dusk-rose bad-girl car, a show winner with two tops (hard and soft), and (purportedly) power everything, online for $44,500. Adding to the car's ample advertised charms and potential investment value was a claim that she might have once been owned by Conway Twitty, the late country-western singer. Even before taking delivery last fall, I used her vehicle identification number, or V.I.N., to begin mapping her history.</p>
        <p>Tracing the car to the singer proved problematic. The Department of Motor Vehicles in most states can provide ownership duration information (minus name and exact address, because of privacy laws), but goes back just a decade. The car's paper and verbal trail confirming ownership led me only to 1982.</p>
        <p>Recollections of the singer's employees and one of his sons, however, strongly suggested a connection to my car. Only 7 percent of the 21,380 '57 Thunderbirds were produced in dusk rose, fewer still with my car's interior colors. According to the executor of Twitty's estate, Hugh Carden, and the singer's son Jimmy Jenkins, Twitty (nee Harold Jenkins) owned a dusk rose '57 T-Bird with a colonial white hardtop, black softtop and black-and-white interior, like mine.</p>
        <p>But Twitty, who died in 1993, had begun selling off his car collection in the early- to mid-80's, and a record of the V.I.N. for that car was gone. She may have passed through a sale by Kruse International, an auction house in Auburn, Ind., that helped liquidate some of Twitty's wheeled assets.</p>
        <p>Sometime in 1982, the car was painted white. She remained white while passing through Michigan, Delaware and ultimately Pennsylvania, where in 1995 a body-shop owner restored her to her original pink glory. The car then won top honors in her class from the Antique Automobile Club of America in 1995.</p>
        <p>So much for sleuthing. The biggest surprise was still to come, and it was not related to the car's provenance. Instead, it was the question of whether my pretty show bird might turn out to be a big pink albatross.</p>
        <p>Sitting next to the delivery van in which she was conveyed to me, unscathed, the car looked great. But my appraiser, recruited online, had failed to take her for a serious drive when he inspected the car, and she sputtered and stalled all the way to her permanent garage space on Long Island.</p>
        <p>As my mechanic, Richie Staff -- the classic car specialist at A. G. Muscle Cars in Port Washington, N.Y. -- pointed out, show cars are usually trucked to venues where they sit unmoved, and are judged on cosmetics alone.</p>
        <p>Among numerous other major and minor problems that Mr. Staff found: the distributor was shot, part of the carburetor was installed upside down and the gas tank seals leaked. Much of the wiring was not only disconnected, but also stripped or corroded, causing sparks and shorts everywhere. The car did not have power brakes, as had been claimed. And the engine and all of the working parts were filthy.</p>
        <p>The good news, Mr. Staff reassured me, was that the quality of the total restoration was excellent, even though it had been done several years before, and the defects he found -- though many -- were largely those endemic to any car that had been stored for years and poorly maintained.</p>
        <p>The car's paint job and chrome were nearly perfect, so all that was needed to make her sparkle were a few dabs of paint and a good cleaning. And reproduced or compatible Thunderbird parts are widely available. The tab for putting my car back on the road was around $10,000. This included installing two fans and a heavy-duty radiator to cool the monster V-8 in hot weather, replacing the accurate-for-show but unsafe tires with whitewall radials and adding seat belts. Front disk and power brakes -- strongly recommended for safety by Mr. Staff -- will cost $2,000. And restoring the two tops and installing the tonneau cover will be $1,600.</p>
        <p>ONE other thing I discovered: if your vintage auto is your only car, in New York State, and in most states according to my research, you cannot get inexpensive classic car insurance, either alone or as an add-on to your existing auto or homeowner's coverage. Chubb was the only insurer that would issue me a standard policy with agreed-upon rather than book-value liability coverage for under $1,900 in the area of Long Island where the car is parked. I bought my policy through SDL Brokerage in Manhattan, whose owner, Donald Jacoby, is a classic-car lover.</p>
        <p>Was it all worth it? I have taken my car on countless outings through three states since her rejuvenation. On her maiden cruise along a stretch of Route 25A on Long Island, after replacing a leaky fuel pump, I had to press pedal to metal. The car sat briefly back on her chrome-skirted haunches and -- hello, darlin' -- sprang forward, V-8 vrooming impressively.</p>
        <p>When I take her out on excursions, I am treated to honks, cheers and ''wows.'' But the best road trip was last fall, not long after the World Trade Center attacks. Cruising down Broadway from Washington Heights through Times Square and the West Village, my sassy pastel cream puff elicited open-mouthed stares and finger-pointing even from toddlers, and smiles and thumbs up from cabbies. When her battery finally went dead (because of a faulty generator), two slightly awestruck cops gave me a friendly police escort to a temporary parking garage. (Bless you, Sgt. Tim Sikorski and Officer Tom Purdy of the Sixth Precinct.)</p>
