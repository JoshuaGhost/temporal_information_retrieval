        <p>About 50 supporters of the young men convicted in the Central Park jogger case gathered last night to protest the request by Manhattan prosecutors for more time to investigate the claim of a convicted murderer that he alone was responsible for the infamous attack 13 years ago.</p>
        <p>''We had no time when our sons were convicted in 1989 and we're not giving them any more time now,'' said Grace Cuffee, the mother of Kevin Richardson, one of the five teenagers who confessed to beating and raping the jogger, then a 28-year-old investment banker.</p>

        <p>About 50 supporters of the young men convicted in the Central Park jogger case gathered last night to protest the request by Manhattan prosecutors for more time to investigate the claim of a convicted murderer that he alone was responsible for the infamous attack 13 years ago.</p>
        <p>''We had no time when our sons were convicted in 1989 and we're not giving them any more time now,'' said Grace Cuffee, the mother of Kevin Richardson, one of the five teenagers who confessed to beating and raping the jogger, then a 28-year-old investment banker.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the five return to Manhattan Criminal Court today for a hearing on their motions to exonerate the men. The district attorney's office is expected to ask Justice Charles J. Tejada of State Supreme Court for more time to check the confession of the convict, Matias Reyes. DNA tests have matched him to semen found on the jogger's sock.</p>
        <p>''I want to assure everyone that this complex and time-consuming investigation is moving forward as quickly as possible,'' District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau told reporters last week.</p>
        <p>The jogger was almost dead when she was found in the park on April 19, 1989. Within 48 hours, Mr. Richardson, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kharey Wise and Yusef Salaam had confessed. All have served their sentences.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cuffee and other supporters of the five spoke at the rally at Mount Olivet Baptist Church, on Malcolm X Boulevard at 120th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wise's mother, Delores Wise, also spoke to prosecutors' request for more time. ''I'm not going to give you another day,'' she told the crowd. ''I'm not even going to give you another five seconds.''</p>
        <p>United States Representative Charles B. Rangel drew cheers when he described perceived abuses in law enforcement. ''In this community,'' he said, ''we're just as afraid of the police as we are of criminals on the street.''</p>
