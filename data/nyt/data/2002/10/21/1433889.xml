        <p>Despite the city's weak economy, almost twice as many restaurants opened in the past year as closed, according to the 2003 Zagat New York City Restaurant Survey published today. The survey said 186 restaurants opened and 104 restaurants closed, but the gap between openings and closings was the narrowest since the recession of the early 1990's. Of the shuttered restaurants, 15 were below Houston Street. ''There's definitely been a bigger loss of business downtown, '' said Tim Zagat, above, a co-publisher of the survey. The Zagat survey also found that people were returning more often to the same restaurant, which may make it harder for new restaurants to attract customers.</p>
