        <p>Frustrating lack of clues in Washington, DC, area sniper shootings is prompting speculation about links to popular thrillers and violent video games; is also raising interest in tarot cards, particularly death card, which was found near one shooting location with Policeman, I am God, written on it (M)</p>

        <p>A frustrating lack of clues in the sniper shootings has prompted speculation about links to popular thrillers, the language of video game enthusiasts and, of course, decks of tarot cards, in particular, the death card, which was found near a school where a 13-year-old boy on Monday became the sniper's eighth victim.</p>
        <p>By today, the American Tarot Association had so many inquiries that it had posted ''fast facts'' sheets about tarot and the death card on its Web site, insisting that the sniper was obviously not someone who knew anything about tarot.</p>

        <p>A frustrating lack of clues in the sniper shootings has prompted speculation about links to popular thrillers, the language of video game enthusiasts and, of course, decks of tarot cards, in particular, the death card, which was found near a school where a 13-year-old boy on Monday became the sniper's eighth victim.</p>
        <p>By today, the American Tarot Association had so many inquiries that it had posted ''fast facts'' sheets about tarot and the death card on its Web site, insisting that the sniper was obviously not someone who knew anything about tarot.</p>
        <p>Video game enthusiasts, too, were despairing of yet another rush to blame violent video games for actual violence, saying many scientists dispute any link between games like Sniper and actual snipers.</p>
        <p>Certainly, anyone who watches the endless array of crime shows on television could spin out a host of scenarios from one of the few tangible clues -- the death card, with ''Policeman, I am God'' written on it.</p>
        <p>Sandra Thomson, a California psychologist who is president of the tarot association, said a number of people had noted to her that in one of the popular cat mysteries written by Lillian Jackson Braun, a turning point is the discovery of the death card at a psychic fair.</p>
        <p>Video game players sometimes use the phrase ''I am God'' to declare mastery over their electronic foes. It appears in reviews of games on Web sites, and was the same phrase Eric Harris, one of the two teenage killers at Columbine High School -- and an avid video game player -- had written in another student's yearbook. Indeed, Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University, calls the suburban sniper ''the adult version of the Columbine killers.''</p>
        <p>And if video games do not provide clues, there is a role-playing game called Deus Ex, in which, according to a Web site that explains the rules, players deal in tarot cards to ''alter events in the mortal world and influence your fellow deities.''</p>
        <p>Tarot card readers say that clue has been particularly misinterpreted.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomson criticized one profiler for saying on television that people should report anyone who owns a tarot card deck or has bought a tarot card deck.</p>
        <p>''How come a bullet casing was found and they didn't suggest we turn in everybody who owns that kind of gun?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''All of us who are accomplished tarot readers understand that the fact that the death card was left is no more significant than if you tore a picture of death out of an art book, or a quote about death from the Bible,'' Ms. Thomson said. ''It's a gimmick.''</p>
        <p>The death card advises a transformation, she said; it does not predict death.</p>
        <p>''No one who uses the tarot cards would select that card to indicate this type of action,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked what kind of card they might leave, Ms. Thomson said the tower card, showing a bolt of God's wrath striking down a tower, and a man and a woman leaping out.</p>
        <p>That, of course, could only inspire more speculation and conspiracy theories.</p>
        <p>Marjorie Heins, a lawyer in New York who is fighting statutes in St. Louis and other cities that ban minors' use of violent video games, said that connections between pop culture and killings were overblown, and that none had ever solved a case.</p>
        <p>''The entertainment or art at most will provide some details for people who are going to do something anyway,'' Ms. Heins said. ''The vast majority of people who play these video games or love horror movies are nonviolent.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Vince Broady, the vice president of Gamespot, a Web site devoted to video and computer games, disputed that ''I am God'' was a phrase particularly associated with those who play the games.</p>
        <p>''Is it something that someone might say as a celebration of victory while playing a game or doing one of a dozen other things?'' Mr. Broady said. ''Sure. It would be very specific to an individual or an instance rather than a common phrase to gaming.''</p>
        <p>Killers may draw inspiration from popular culture, Mr. Levin, at Northeastern, said. Kip Kinkel, who killed his parents and two classmates in Oregon, claimed inspiration from ''Romeo and Juliet,'' for example, but pop culture then elevates killers into celebrities.</p>
        <p>''It's a vicious cycle,'' Mr. Levin said.</p>
        <p>THE MARYLAND SHOOTINGS: THE SPECULATION  Correction:  October 15, 2002, Tuesday  An article on Friday about speculation that popular culture might hold clues to the sniper shootings near Washington misspelled the given name of an author who has used a tarot card as an element in a mystery. She is Lilian Jackson Braun, not Lillian.</p>
