        <p>SWAN</p>
        <p>By Frances Mayes.</p>
        <p>Broadway, $25.</p>
        <p>In her first novel, the memoirist and poet Frances Mayes (''Under the Tuscan Sun'') shifts her gaze from the sunny hills of Cortona, Italy, to the broad avenues and well-kept secrets of Swan, Ga. Most of the action in ''Swan'' takes place in this tiny mill town where everyone knows something about everyone else's business. The business at hand is the mysterious exhumation of Catherine Mason, 19 years after her burial. The incident brings both of Catherine's adult children back to town -- Ginger from Italy and J. J., her older brother, from the family cabin just a few miles down the road, where he has lived as a near-recluse for years. After the police determine that Catherine's death was not, as long believed, a suicide, ''Swan'' becomes a folksy whodunit, replete with a missing envelope, illicit affairs, a jealous spinster aunt and decades-old grudges. But this aspect of the story is less satisfying than the discoveries Ginger and J. J. make about their parents. In Italy, Ginger works as an archaeologist, and J. J. has his own interest in antiquated civilizations: he collects arrowheads and spears he finds in the local riverbed. Old sketchbooks of Catherine's, filled with writings and drawings from the years when J. J. was a toddler and Ginger not yet born, force the siblings to do some digging through their own family history. Loaded with finely drawn minor characters and the alluring atmosphere of the American South, ''Swan'' is a well-paced if modest entertainment.</p>
