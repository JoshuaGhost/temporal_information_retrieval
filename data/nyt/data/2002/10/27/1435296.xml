        <p>THIS Halloween, Ichabod Crane turns 215 years old. All these years you probably thought poor old Ichabod was a figment of Washington Irving's imagination. As the hapless hero of one of America's most endearing folk tales, ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' Ichabod Crane is best remembered for his run-in with the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.</p>
        <p>In one of those odd twists of fate, Washington Irving and Ichabod B. Crane were both stationed at Fort Pike in Sackett Harbor during the War of 1812. At the time, Crane was a 27-year-old artillery captain in the Marines. He was far from the gangly schoolteacher Irving portrayed in his tale. Irving was an aide-de-camp to Gov. Daniel D. Tompkins of New York and in charge of overseeing Sackett Harbor's defenses against the British.</p>
        <p>Irving was already something of a celebrity for his Knickerbocker History of New York, a hilarious parody of the city's past written at the expense of many a good Dutch family's ancestors. They both knew Commodore Stephen Decatur, whose war exploits earned him hero status.</p>
        <p>Crane earned his place in history for a much different reason. Down on his luck and living in England in 1819, Irving wrote ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' as one of several short stories published in ''The Sketch Book.'' The hero of his story was none other than Ichabod Crane.</p>
        <p>The book was an instant success, and we can only speculate how its popularity affected the real Ichabod Crane. For the record, Crane was a New Jersey native and son of Gen. William Crane of Elizabethtown, now Elizabeth. Born on July 18, 1787, he enlisted in the Marines in 1809. After a two-year stint aboard the 44-gun frigate United States under Commodore Decatur's command, Crane saw action in Canada before going to Fort Pike.</p>
        <p>Neither man left a record of meeting the other. But Irving was famous for borrowing the names of those he knew for his storytelling. While Captain Crane was stationed in Rhode Island after the war, Irving may have borrowed his name for the gangly, superstitious schoolteacher in ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and probably had a good laugh doing it.</p>
        <p>By the time Irving returned to America in 1832, he was an international celebrity and Crane was a lieutenant colonel leading troops in the Black Hawk War in Illinois. The fact that his fictitious namesake was renowned may have even helped Crane's military career. Who knows? He certainly had name recognition. During the Mexican War, he was promoted to superintendent of recruiting and later was governor of the Military Asylum in Washington. After his namesake's reported encounter with a Headless Horseman, that may have been a fitting place for Colonel Crane.</p>
        <p>By 1853, Crane returned to New York, still on active duty at the age of 66. He and his wife, Charlotte, built a home at Point Richmond on Staten Island, where he died, coincidentally, in October 1857. Irving died two years later at his Sunnyside estate in Tarrytown.</p>
        <p>Crane was buried in New Springfield and his tombstone bears the insignia of his military regiment, along with a simple inscription: ''He served his country for 45 years and was much beloved and respected by all who knew him.''</p>
        <p>Trouble is, everybody does know him, but for all the wrong reasons. So, add a P.S. to the colonel's tombstone about his having a good sense of humor.</p>
        <p>As Irving's short story grew to become an American folk legend, the writer was pressed to reveal the identity behind Ichabod Crane. Ever the storyteller, he varied his answers depending upon his audience. Irving's most common response included a friend, Jesse Merwin, teacher in Kinderhook, after whom he said he modeled Ichabod. Flattered, Merwin returned the favor by naming one of his sons after Irving.</p>
        <p>The closest Irving ever came to naming Ichabod B. Crane as his inspiration was when he confided that Ichabod was a composite drawn from several personal acquaintances. Although the colonel's name was never mentioned, there can be little doubt he provided the writer with an irresistible moniker and even less doubt that Halloween wasn't exactly his favorite time of year.</p>
