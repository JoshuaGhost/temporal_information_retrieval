        <p>People who chew garlic tablets to help their hearts while avoiding the smell may be helping nothing at all. A study being published online today showed that 7 of 14 garlic supplements contained less of garlic's active ingredient than researchers called necessary for a therapeutic effect.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by ConsumerLab.com, a company that tests dietary supplements. Dr. Tod Cooperman, ConsumerLab's president, said the products varied widely in their strength.</p>
        <p>Garlic is thought to help prevent clogging of the arteries by lowering levels of harmful cholesterol. In the body, garlic is converted to allicin, and most studies that have found therapeutic effects have involved daily doses of 3,600 to 5,400 micrograms of allicin, Dr. Cooperman said. The daily doses among the products tested ranged from 400 to 6,500 micrograms.</p>
        <p>To add to the confusion, some labels state their potency in terms of allicin, while others use different terms. John Cardellina, vice president for botanical science at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for herbal product makers, said the only part of the Consumerlab analysis he agreed with was that ''garlic is a very confusing supplement.''</p>
        <p>He called the analysis flawed because many supplement makers contend that other substances in garlic besides allicin also provide benefits. ''The real question is, Does a particular manufacturer have clinical trial data for its particular product?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cooperman described a simpler alternative to the garlic supplements: chewing one uncooked garlic clove every day. ''If you can live with the odor, you might be better off,'' he said.</p>
