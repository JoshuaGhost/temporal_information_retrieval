        <p>Thirty years in international public health has taught me that the supply chain is a critical but often overlooked element in the success of any health program.

To ensure that condoms and other essential health commodities provided by donors don't languish and expire in central warehouses, products must move through an efficient supply chain.</p>
        <p>This requires that storage facilities be improved, distribution systems be strengthened and demand be monitored so that the existing supply of condoms can be made available wherever and whenever a man or woman wants one.</p>
