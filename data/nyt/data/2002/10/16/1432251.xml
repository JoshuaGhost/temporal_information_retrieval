      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For the greatest African rock musicians, every homecoming carries back something new. Salif Keita, from Mali, led his band on Sunday night at Irving Plaza in songs that seemed to have all of Africa, and beyond, at their fingertips. He has constantly hybridized his music, and with his current band he folds all his exotica into arrangements that only seems traditional.</p>
        <p>Mali pervaded the songs: in the way Mr. Keita's high voice could simultaneously implore and insist, in rhythms subdivided by calabashes and hand drums, in glimmering runs plucked on traditional harp-lutes, in a keyboard set to sound like a traditional balafon (marimba), in melodies that used the modes of traditional griots' and hunters' songs. But the music also looked across Africa and into rock and jazz.</p>

        <p>For the greatest African rock musicians, every homecoming carries back something new. Salif Keita, from Mali, led his band on Sunday night at Irving Plaza in songs that seemed to have all of Africa, and beyond, at their fingertips. He has constantly hybridized his music, and with his current band he folds all his exotica into arrangements that only seems traditional.</p>
        <p>Mali pervaded the songs: in the way Mr. Keita's high voice could simultaneously implore and insist, in rhythms subdivided by calabashes and hand drums, in glimmering runs plucked on traditional harp-lutes, in a keyboard set to sound like a traditional balafon (marimba), in melodies that used the modes of traditional griots' and hunters' songs. But the music also looked across Africa and into rock and jazz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keita's exquisite new album, ''Moffou'' (Decca/Universal), relies almost entirely on acoustic instruments. Although he usually just sings with his band onstage, he opened the concert alone with an acoustic guitar, and he needed nothing else. Transferring the sound of Malian harps to the guitar, he picked meticulous arpeggios and quick lines as he revisited two of his African hits, ''Iniagige'' and ''Ananaming,'' while a good part of the audience sang along.</p>
        <p>Then his band joined him, and the dance party began. Malian harps (the small n'goni and the long-necked camele n'goni) interlaced their patterns with keyboard, electric guitar and bass, while percussionists made the beat gallop and crackle. Two female singers answered Mr. Keita's voice and tossed calabash-and-cowrie-shell bowl rattles in the air; then, as the band took over, one stepped forward to dance with flying limbs and swiveling hips as the djembe (hand drum) player took his place at her side. Soon enough, audience members were taking their turns onstage.</p>
        <p>The music had the airborne intricacy of traditional styles, and in ''Mandjou'' Mr. Keita used the sweeping phrases of a griot. Yet the songs were fusions. Most had short, basic melodies like Western rock tunes, while the stately unison melodies of Arab-influenced North African music, the stubborn funk of Nigerian Afrobeat, the lilt of rhumba and the explicit downbeats of funk also surfaced. Harouna Samake, on camele n'goni, brought a rocker's showmanship to his solos, snapping and twanging out lines while at one point holding his instrument upside-down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keita has been making musical connections for decades, but his latest synthesis was so light-fingered and ingenious that ambition was swallowed in grace and sheer delight.</p>
