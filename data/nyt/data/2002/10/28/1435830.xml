        <p>The prime minister of Antigua, Lester Bird, named a task force today to investigate how John Allen Muhammad, an American citizen being held in the sniper killings, obtained an Antiguan passport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad lived here briefly two years ago with three of his children. The other men being held, John Lee Malvo, a teenager who most assumed was his son, also lived with the family and several other people.</p>
        <p>Documents released last week indicated that Mr. Muhammad might have fraudulently obtained an Antiguan passport that was issued to him on July 4, 2000. The documents showed that he obtained a passport because his mother, Eva Ferris, was born in Antigua. However, Maxine Allen, Mrs. Ferris's daughter and a newscaster on Observer Radio here, has said her family has no relation to Mr. Muhammad.</p>
