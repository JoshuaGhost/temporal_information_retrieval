        <p>One day after a student was stabbed in a high school in Queens, school officials announced plans yesterday to place 285 additional security guards in schools in the next two months.</p>
        <p>The guards will work from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., when thousands of students at 66 schools in the city pass through metal detectors before entering the buildings.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a student was stabbed in the chest with a steak knife at Springfield Gardens High School in Queens. The student, Darnell McCall, 18, was listed in stable condition yesterday. In August, a student was shot to death outside John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Serious crime in the schools has dropped over the last three years, but more must be done to protect students, said Benjamin B. Tucker, who was appointed last month to head the Office of School Planning and Safety.</p>
        <p>There are now 3,850 security guards working in New York public schools, about 400 short of the number provided for in the budget, Mr. Tucker said. The department will work to add space to train more security guards and improve the training program, he said. Currently, only 150 guards can be trained at one time.</p>
        <p>Of the new security guards, 135 officers are now working on truancy issues, tracking down students who skip school. An additional 150 are set to graduate from the New York Police Department's 10-week training program in November. The department took control of school security officers in 1999.</p>
        <p>More supervision will be added to the 66 schools where students are required to go through metal detectors and scanners similar to those at airports.</p>
        <p>''We recognize that the process doesn't always work as smoothly as it could,'' Mr. Tucker said.</p>
        <p>At Kennedy, students sometimes wait in line for nearly an hour before they can enter the building.</p>
        <p>The department sent a memo to all school principals yesterday asking them to focus on school safety and to review building protocols, Mr. Tucker said. Principals and other school officials should be patrolling the hallways, stairwells, bathrooms and cafeterias, Mr. Tucker said.</p>
        <p>''The notion is the more adults who are visible to students, the less chance there is for disorder to take place,'' he said. ''It can't be expected that the safety agents have to do the jobs all by themselves.''</p>
        <p>The teachers' union scheduled a news conference for today to voice concerns about increases in school violence and teachers' fears.</p>
