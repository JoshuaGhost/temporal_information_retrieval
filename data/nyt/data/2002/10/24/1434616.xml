        <p>The reclusive leader of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Velupillai Prabhakaran, left, met with Norwegian mediators to discuss the second round of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, which are scheduled for the end of this month. A first round of talks aimed at ending the country's civil war were held in Thailand in September, but the peace effort remains threatened by the strained relationship between Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who has been critical of the government's peace moves. On Tuesday the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot amend the Constitution to limit the president's power without first holding a referendum. Government officials have indicated that they would be more likely to call an early election.</p>
