        <p>It's a wonder that dozens of films and plays haven't been written about Amedeo Modigliani. His life story has all the sexy material a mini-series fan could want. He was a handsome young Italian who moved to Paris and struggled for years to sell his paintings. He abused drugs and alcohol and had a turbulent affair with a British poet, Beatrice Hastings. He found love again but died young (35), of tubercular meningitis. The day after his death Jeanne Hébuterne, the mother of his 14-month-old daughter, flung herself out a window. Two years later Modigliani was famous.</p>
        <p>And as we learn in the involving revival of Dennis McIntyre's ''Modigliani,'' which opened on Sept. 22 at St. Peter's Theater, he also had a bitter hatred that ate at his soul. He despised Picasso.</p>

        <p>It's a wonder that dozens of films and plays haven't been written about Amedeo Modigliani. His life story has all the sexy material a mini-series fan could want. He was a handsome young Italian who moved to Paris and struggled for years to sell his paintings. He abused drugs and alcohol and had a turbulent affair with a British poet, Beatrice Hastings. He found love again but died young (35), of tubercular meningitis. The day after his death Jeanne Hébuterne, the mother of his 14-month-old daughter, flung herself out a window. Two years later Modigliani was famous.</p>
        <p>And as we learn in the involving revival of Dennis McIntyre's ''Modigliani,'' which opened on Sept. 22 at St. Peter's Theater, he also had a bitter hatred that ate at his soul. He despised Picasso.</p>
        <p>The original New York production of ''Modigliani,'' in 1978, was praised for its vividness and urgency, and those qualities come through in the new staging. The play, which runs three hours, does not feel long. There are moments, however, when a languid scene, with Erik Satie's music in the background, has a slightly too tranquilizing effect.</p>
        <p>Sometimes languid, sometimes violently energetic, the play covers three days in the artist's life, in 1916 or so, building to an important meeting with an art dealer who may change Modigliani's fortunes overnight. In the first act Modigliani's friends and fellow artists Chaim Soutine (Panos Makedonas) and Maurice Utrillo (Jacob Battat) debate the advisability of stealing a dead cow and murdering the boyfriend of Utrillo's mother. The mother cannot know anything of the murder plans, Utrillo says, because ''I want it to be a surprise.''</p>
        <p>Modigliani (William Abadie), whom everyone calls Modi, joins them, and the audience gradually learns about his enormous self-doubt and his painter's block. He's running from the police (for breaking a very expensive restaurant window) and is thinking about moving to Martinique, although he doesn't know where that is, while Beatrice (Nandana Sen) is threatening to go to Cape Town. Eventually Modigliani hatches a plot to burn down the Louvre.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abadie is a master at playing deathly ill and at conveying the tension involved in trying to give the right answers, tell the right lies, to Guillaume Chéron (Bruno Gelormini), the dealer, who is not a nice man. Chéron is unsympathetic, to say the least, to the plight of struggling young painters. ''If you don't have the endurance,'' he says arrogantly, brandishing a solid gold cigarette case, ''then you shouldn't be so ambitious, should you?''</p>
        <p>There is not a bad performance in this production. If the play doesn't soar to emotional heights, it does convey the message that being a starving artist is unromantic and agonizing. Sure, these young men sit around Parisian cafes looking blasé, but they're in a collective state of nervous desperation. Knowing they can't pay the bill, they're working up the nerve to rob the waiter.</p>
