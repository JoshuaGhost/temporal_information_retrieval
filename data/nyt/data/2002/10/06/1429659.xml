        <p>WHAT'S the worst part of wearing an adhesive bandage? Probably the ''ouch'' factor, while pulling it off.</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is trying to eliminate that with the Band-Aid Liquid Bandage, a liquid version of the traditional Band-Aid.</p>
        <p>The liquid version also addresses another problem: it won't come off when you shower, do dishes or play in the yard.</p>
        <p>''There are a whole lot of places to use the Liquid Bandage where a regular Band-Aid doesn't work, like the end of your finger or your knuckles,'' said Dr. Steve Koontz, worldwide director for scientific affairs at the Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Companies, who led the product's development team. ''The benefits really show up best in places that are hard to bandage.''</p>
        <p>The Liquid Bandage is based on the same technology as Dermabond, a glue used for years by hospitals in place of sutures.</p>
        <p>Drops of Liquid Bandage are placed on an applicator swab and spread over a cleaned wound. The liquid on the swab produces a chemical reaction that quickly forms a clear waterproof film. Four drops create a film about the size of a quarter; the liquid dries in less than a minute.</p>
        <p>The product helps to reduce minor surface pain by sealing off nerve endings. ''Liquid Bandage makes the right environment for healing,'' Dr. Koontz said. ''The scab is the body's way of putting a protector on top of a wound. But a scab essentially makes a dry, desertlike impediment to healing, whereas the Liquid Bandage keeps in moisture, so the healing cells can work.''</p>
        <p>Once the damaged cells have healed, the Liquid Bandage disappears. ''It binds to the skin cells, so as skin replaces itself, it will essentially just slough off,'' said Dr. Koontz, who has been working on the project for more than two years.</p>
        <p>The product reached store shelves in April. A box containing a bottle with 40 drops of Liquid Bandage and 10 applicators sells for $7.99; it has a shelf life of two years.</p>
        <p>''We think it's a very, very interesting technology,'' Dr. Koontz said. ''It helps your body heal as best it can.''</p>
