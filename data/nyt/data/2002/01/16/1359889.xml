        <p>After placing their captain, Mark Messier, and one of their top scorers, Andreas Johansson, on the injured list, the Rangers arrived in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday afternoon for tonight's back end of a home-and-home series with the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
        <p>Messier, who turns 41 on Friday, has missed the last five games with chronic pain in his left shoulder. Johansson, who scored his 13th goal of the season in Monday night's 2-2 tie with the Blue Jackets at Madison Square Garden, fractured his left wrist after being hammered by Columbus's Tyler Wright late in the third period.</p>

        <p>After placing their captain, Mark Messier, and one of their top scorers, Andreas Johansson, on the injured list, the Rangers arrived in Columbus, Ohio, yesterday afternoon for tonight's back end of a home-and-home series with the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
        <p>Messier, who turns 41 on Friday, has missed the last five games with chronic pain in his left shoulder. Johansson, who scored his 13th goal of the season in Monday night's 2-2 tie with the Blue Jackets at Madison Square Garden, fractured his left wrist after being hammered by Columbus's Tyler Wright late in the third period.</p>
        <p>The tie halted the Rangers' six-game losing streak, their longest of the season. But the Rangers, who never trailed in the game, surrendered a power-play goal with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining in regulation after Columbus had pulled its goaltender in favor of an extra attacker. So, the Rangers' streak stands at seven games without a victory, 0-5-1-1, also a season worst.</p>
        <p>Messier and Johansson were placed on injured reserve to make room for forwards Rico Fata and Jason Dawe, who were summoned from Hartford on Monday night. They practiced with the Rangers yesterday morning and were expected to be activated before tonight's game.</p>
        <p>In 25 games with Hartford, the Rangers' top minor league affiliate, Fata had 16 goals and 19 assists for 35 points. In 39 games with the Wolf Pack, Dawe had 16 goals and 17 assists for 33 points.</p>
