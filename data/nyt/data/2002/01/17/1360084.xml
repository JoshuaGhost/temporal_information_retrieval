        <p>An Algerian man was sentenced to 24 years in prison yesterday for his role in a plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport during millennium celebrations in 1999.</p>
        <p>The man, Mokhtar Haouari, 33, was convicted last July of conspiring to support a plan by Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian terrorist, to enter the United States from Canada and set off a bomb at the airport as part of an Islamic holy war.</p>
        <p>Judge John F. Keenan of United States District Court in Manhattan said he set Mr. Haouari's sentence near the maximum of 24 years and 5 months because of the seriousness of the offense.</p>
        <p>''The defendant's conduct here created a grave risk to the well-being and safety of the people of America,'' Judge Keenan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haouari ''either knew or consciously avoided learning the details of Mr. Ressam's plan to blow up the Los Angeles airport,'' the judge said. ''Such activity is reprehensible and must be gravely punished, else the law becomes a mockery and society becomes prey to the forces of evil and destruction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haouari appeared impassive during the sentencing, and when asked by the judge whether he had anything to say, he said he did not.</p>
        <p>He was running a gift shop in Montreal when he became involved in the plot. As sidelines, according to evidence at his trial, he dealt in false identification documents and check and credit card schemes. In addition to conspiracy, he was convicted of four counts of bank and document fraud.</p>
        <p>The bombing never happened because Mr. Ressam, the would-be bomber, was arrested at the Canadian border on Dec. 14, 1999. He was tried and convicted in Los Angeles, and later agreed to testify at Mr. Haouari's trial.</p>
        <p>He said he told Mr. Haouari that he had ''dangerous business in America'' and needed money and false identification documents. Mr. Haouari, Mr. Ressam said, gave him $3,000 and a fake driver's license and recruited a friend who lived in Brooklyn to help him when he reached the United States.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators have said they think Mr. Ressam's plot was linked to Osama bin Laden's worldwide terrorist network.</p>
