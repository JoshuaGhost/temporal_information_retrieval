        <p>Coach Louis Orr had to be wondering how Seton Hall would handle its latest tumble, an embarrassing 26-point loss Wednesday to Georgetown. During this unsatisfying season, his players have not been known for their ability to take a punch. Would they wallow in their misery, or get angry and inspired?</p>
        <p>The scoreboard told the answer. Seton Hall took its problems out on the Big East weakling West Virginia tonight in an 81-67 victory at Continental Arena that was not as close as the final score indicated.</p>

        <p>Coach Louis Orr had to be wondering how Seton Hall would handle its latest tumble, an embarrassing 26-point loss Wednesday to Georgetown. During this unsatisfying season, his players have not been known for their ability to take a punch. Would they wallow in their misery, or get angry and inspired?</p>
        <p>The scoreboard told the answer. Seton Hall took its problems out on the Big East weakling West Virginia tonight in an 81-67 victory at Continental Arena that was not as close as the final score indicated.</p>
        <p>''Of course we were mad,'' Seton Hall forward John Allen said. ''We were blown out by a team that we know well and were supposed to be up for. We didn't just want to win, we wanted to make a statement. Now we've got to make a statement against a quality team.''</p>
        <p>Andre Barrett played his usual solid game for Seton Hall, scoring a team-high 19 points with just one turnover. Of course, it did not hurt the Pirates that West Virginia (7-9 over all, 0-5 Big East) missed its first 16 3-point attempts and got 1-for-17 shooting from its starting backcourt, which included the fill-in Jay Hewitt.</p>
        <p>Hewitt was pressed into service after the regular point guard, Jonathan Hargett, underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Hargett, a freshman, had been an offensive spark, averaging 14.4 points and 4.6 assists a game. Seton Hall (10-8, 3-3) held Hewitt scoreless (0 for 6 from the floor) and forced him into 3 turnovers. His backcourt mate, Lionel Armstead, was 1 for 11 and had 5 points.</p>
        <p>''We got on those guys bringing the ball upcourt and played the passing lanes,'' Seton Hall guard Darius Lane said. ''After we found out their point guard wasn't going to be here, we decided to go after those other guys even more.''</p>
        <p>Orr agreed.</p>
        <p>''We shot 37.5 percent for the game and won by 14 points,'' he said. ''The reason we could do that is we played good, aggressive defense. The pressure applied by our guards was the difference.''</p>
        <p>Both teams struggled early on. Seton Hall was ahead by only 7-6 at the 13-minute mark. Seton Hall finally got it going midway through the half, piecing together a 13-0 run that put the Pirates ahead, 34-16, with 2 minutes 15 seconds left.</p>
        <p>West Virginia could not do much right in the second half, either, but Coach Gale Catlett did not give up. With his team trailing by as many as 19 points in the final two minutes, Catlett insisted on having it foul on every possession. As a result, Seton Hall attempted 44 free throws, a record for a college game here.</p>
        <p>Chris Moss led the Mountaineers with 25 points.</p>
