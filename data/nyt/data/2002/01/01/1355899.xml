        <p>Across the Fire Department, the news that Nicholas Scoppetta had been appointed the new commissioner was greeted yesterday with hope that he would help lift the state of siege at the department.</p>
        <p>Some of the difficulties the department and Mr. Scoppetta face are logistical. Dozens of experienced leaders were killed on Sept. 11, along with the core of many firehouses and special units.</p>
        <p>Besides the losses, many in the ranks of the department are still staggering emotionally, some in a lingering sorrow, others in rage at remote figures like the departing commissioner and the former mayor. In addition, while looking after their own families, the firefighters  are also trying to handle chores for the families of friends who were killed.</p>
        <p>Although they know little about Mr. Scoppetta, a number of firefighters welcomed his appointment, particularly his pledge to concentrate on administrative concerns rather than firefighting tactics. Mr. Scoppetta, 69, most recently led the Administration for Children's Services and has a long record in city government and as a lawyer, factors that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said were critical in his choice.</p>
        <p>''I think a fresh face with fresh ideas is what this department really needs,'' said Firefighter Mark Holstrom, a 13-year veteran with Engine Company 280 in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. ''Lots of guys want the firefighters to fight fires. It was nice to hear him say that. It's a welcome thing from the chiefs on down to the firemen. We appreciate that he's an administrator. We're not worried that he doesn't have any experience in the department.''</p>
        <p>Firefighter Tim Rogers, a 29-year veteran with Squad Company 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, who is retiring this year, said he thought Mr. Scoppetta was a good choice to tackle complicated problems. ''Our job is in a lot of turmoil after Sept. 11,'' Firefighter Rogers said. ''There's a lot that needs to be juggled. Some firehouses like this one lost a lot of guys, some didn't lose any. How do you deal with that?''</p>
        <p>Many saw Mr. Scoppetta's record with the child welfare system as helpful on several fronts. Firefighter Michael Stackpole said that with so many of the ''wartime leaders'' of the department lost on Sept. 11, the new chiefs needed bolstering. ''We need somebody who can make command decisions, someone who can instill confidence in us,'' Firefighter Stackpole said. ''It's been decision-making by committee.</p>
        <p>''We need someone who can restore the confidence in our new chiefs and make them willing to make decisions on their own,'' he said. ''I'm optimistic that Mr. Scoppetta can do that.'' Firefighter Stackpole's brother Timothy, a fire captain, died at the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>Lee Ielpi, a retired firefighter whose son Jonathan, also a firefighter, died on Sept. 11, thought that Mr. Scoppetta's service with families in crisis would help the survivors. ''A tremendous amount of children were hit with this,'' Mr. Ielpi said. ''I thought his statement was well put -- that the firefighting end is able to run itself, and hopefully it will run the same way as before.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Tierney, a deputy commissioner who has been helping families of the dead firefighters since Sept. 11, said the department ''has critical needs, and Mr. Scoppetta's experience with families and children will serve us well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scoppetta's government service, which dates to the Lindsay administration, includes jobs as commissioner of investigations, deputy mayor for criminal justice, and as a prosecutor. An often-overlooked but critical function of the Fire Department is fire investigation. ''He's got a law enforcement background, and that's helpful to those of us who do the investigations,'' said Chief Fire Marshal Louis Garcia.</p>
        <p>Daniel A. Nigro, the chief of department, the highest ranking uniformed position, said Mr. Scoppetta would be a persuasive advocate within city government because of his reputation. ''He's a man of stature, well respected in city government,'' the chief said. ''I had heard he was leaving city government. The fact that he has decided to come here is a positive sign for the department.''</p>
        <p>Michael Regan, the first deputy fire commissioner, had been ranked as the top candidate for the job by the Bloomberg transition team, but withdrew from consideration after taking a position in the private sector. Mr. Scoppetta's appointment, he said, brings a mature vision to a post fraught with complications.</p>
        <p>''He gets it,'' Mr. Regan said, ''He has a tremendous record.''</p>
