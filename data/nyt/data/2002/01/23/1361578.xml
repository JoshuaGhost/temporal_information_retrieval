        <p>The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said today that he would consider firing members of a commission charged with reviewing requests for tax reductions in the wake of reports that politically connected residents received significant tax breaks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi said that before taking office Jan. 1 he knew that the problems plaguing the county's tax assessment system were extensive and would be among his most significant challenges.

        <p>MINEOLA, N.Y., Jan. 22 Â— The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said today that he would consider firing members of a commission charged with reviewing requests for tax reductions in the wake of reports that politically connected residents received significant tax breaks.</p>

        <p>The Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said today that he would consider firing members of a commission charged with reviewing requests for tax reductions in the wake of reports that politically connected residents received significant tax breaks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi said that before taking office Jan. 1 he knew that the problems plaguing the county's tax assessment system were extensive and would be among his most significant challenges. But his statement today was in response to an article in Newsday alleging that special treatment was given to some applicants for tax reductions.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest single problem facing Nassau County today,'' he said. ''This department is completely underfunded, and there are few if any procedures and processes. It lacks any formality, and it's no surprise that things are such a mess.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Suozzi said he was developing a strategy for coordinating those branches of county government that deal with tax claims and planning a total revamping of the members of the commission.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to evaluate them on a case by case scenario, and I wouldn't be surprised if many of them were asked to go,'' Mr. Suozzi said. He also said he intended to put in place a set of procedures to ensure that all claims are dealt with equitably.</p>
        <p>In a Jan. 14 letter to Mr. Suozzi, the Nassau County district attorney, Denis E. Dillon, wrote that his office was investigating the commission and that a preliminary review ''reveals areas of significant concern in the assessment review process and the management of the agency.''</p>
        <p>The commissioners have ''failed to utilize a uniform standard of review,'' Mr. Dillon wrote, and have reviewed applications submitted by people they may have had business, social or political relationships with ''in potential violation of the provisions of the Nassau County Code of Ethics.'' In addition, Mr. Dillon wrote, commissioners' productivity is not monitored, creating ''a significant backlog of cases.''</p>
        <p>Newsday reported today that of 886 homeowners who received tax reductions last year from the assessment review commission, about 65 had blatant political or social connections. They included members of local town boards, a former Nassau legislator and the longtime secretary of the Nassau Republican chairman.</p>
        <p>By law there should be nine assessment review commissioners, but two of the posts are vacant.</p>
        <p>John P. Marcin, chairman of the assessment review commission, disputed the number of residential tax reductions granted last year, saying that his office granted about 2,000 reductions, not just 886. He denied that politically connected residents received preferential treatment and insisted that when politically connected people submitted applications, ''they were carefully scrutinized, and unless it was an open-and-shut case they got nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcin added, ''You can always find discrepancies in anything you look for, and because valuation is not a science but an art, you can always find differences of opinion.''</p>
