        <p>Charlene Seymore stood in her kitchen in Brownsville, Brooklyn, peeling potatoes. Piece by piece, long spirals of skin dropped into the bottom of her sink.</p>
        <p>Then her younger son, Teon, 4, came running into the room. ''Hey Mom!'' he said excitedly, a smile on his face from ear to ear. ''We can watch wrestling tonight.''</p>
        <p>''I know,'' she said, her voice quiet and calming. ''Eight o'clock.''</p>
        <p>On the stove top, a pot of water stood ready to receive the peeled potatoes, and another ready to boil corn. In the oven, three portions of beef short ribs were simmering.</p>
        <p>It was a normal weekday afternoon for Ms. Seymore, 45. Normal now that she has stopped using crack and devotes herself to raising her two boys -- Alex, 7, and Teon, 4.</p>
        <p>As recently as two years ago, normal afternoons for Ms. Seymore included hours in a drug-induced haze. ''When you're on drugs, you're in another universe,'' Ms. Seymore said last week. ''You get the kids anything in the world just to keep them in the back room; you say anything to keep them away.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seymore lived with her two boys in a fourth-floor walkup in Flatbush. There were many afternoons when Alex would find his mother passed out on the floor and would pick up her drugs and the glass tube she used for smoking crack and put them away. ''When I started seeing that he was going to school seeing all this, it was too much,'' Ms. Seymore said. ''But I really didn't wake up until I was in jail.''</p>
        <p>Her cold wake-up came in September 2000, when she was arrested for possession of crack and sentenced to 45 days in the Brooklyn House of Detention. ''That was the worst 45 days of my life,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When she got out of prison, she called her sister, Gloria, who had been taking care of the boys and now told her they were in the custody of the city's Administration for Children's Services and would not be returned to her until she submitted a clean urine test.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seymore provided the sample and regained custody of her children. But she did not want to move back into her apartment, which she associated with smoking crack. So she made a vow to stay clean, and moved in with her sister in East New York. She lived there for seven months rather than risk returning to her apartment. ''That place, to me it was possessed,'' she said. ''If I walked in there I had to smoke.''</p>
        <p>While she lived with her sister, she began attending a drug rehabilitation program five days a week that is run by the Jewish Child Care Association of New York, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.</p>
        <p>Aside from taking the course, Ms. Seymore spent time looking for an apartment. She and her boys moved into the unfurnished apartment in Brownsville in May 2001.</p>
        <p>For the first two months there, life was difficult. Because Ms. Seymore and her sons had no beds, they slept on the hardwood floor in the living room.</p>
        <p>After Gioconda Lobaton, a social worker for the association, visited the apartment and saw where the family was sleeping, she used money from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy three new beds.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Seymore sleeps in her own room while the boys sleep in the adjacent one, in a pair of twin beds that nearly fill their small bedroom.</p>
        <p>''When I get on the bed, I'm comfortable,'' Teon said, sitting on his bed and eating crackers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Seymore said that once Teon is in school, she hopes to learn to be a home health aide and begin earning an income to support the family. At the moment, she depends on monthly public benefits that she said provide just enough to cover her expenses -- about $300 in food stamps, $240 in welfare, and $536 in Supplemental Security Income to care for Alex, who is on medication for attention deficit disorder and has spent time under psychiatric evaluation.</p>
        <p>But she said she could not forget about her other goal of reuniting all her children, who were born of multiple fathers with whom she has no contact and from whom she does not receive child support. In addition to Alex and Teon, Ms. Seymore has seven children ranging in age from 29 to 11. Three of them were adopted by her sister, two are in foster care, and two have grown and live on their own, one in Ohio and one in Texas.</p>
        <p>''My goal is to see my kids,'' she said. ''That counts more than anything. If I don't see them, I would like for all my kids to know each other.''</p>
