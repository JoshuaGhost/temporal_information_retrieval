        <p>There must have been a time, years ago, when nobody worried about why a detachment of mid-spring days, like the ones just past in New York City, would pop up at the tail end of January. Last weekend was Georgia weather in Central Park, a hint of the Carolinas on the Grand Concourse, temperatures 20 degrees and more above normal. Enjoyable as they were, those temperatures were also inherently worrisome. People who wanted only to sit in the sun had to do so next to people who wanted to sit in the sun but couldn't help asking, ''What does it mean?'' before being overcome by the joy of basking like a lizard on a hot rock.</p>
        <p>In a way, the high temperatures of the past few days have made it easy to forget that the whole winter, so far, has been unusually warm. We've had almost none of those dark, snow-driven nights when you dread coming to the corner of a block because an Arctic crosstown wind waits there to snatch at your coat and chafe your ears. Most winters bring a week or two when you feel as if you've turned into glass and are about to break. This winter has been unobtrusively warm, but warm nonetheless. And dry. Where are the curb-deep slush ponds of yesteryear?</p>

        <p>The conservation measures that would be relatively painless now will be much harder to follow when April really comes.</p>

        <p>There must have been a time, years ago, when nobody worried about why a detachment of mid-spring days, like the ones just past in New York City, would pop up at the tail end of January.

        <p>In a way, the high temperatures of the past few days have made it easy to forget that the whole winter, so far, has been unusually warm. We've had almost none of those dark, snow-driven nights when you dread coming to the corner of a block because an Arctic crosstown wind waits there to snatch at your coat and chafe your ears. Most winters bring a week or two when you feel as if you've turned into glass and are about to break. This winter has been unobtrusively warm, but warm nonetheless. And dry. Where are the curb-deep slush ponds of yesteryear?</p>
        <p>By itself, the warmth poses no immediate regional problems. The dryness does. The city's reservoirs are only half as full as they should be this time of year, and yesterday the city issued a drought warning. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has asked New Yorkers to take voluntary measures to cut water usage. ''Basically,'' he said, ''what we have here is a failure of nature to cooperate.'' The mayor must have been speaking ironically. The idea that nature cooperates with New York City is striking. In fact, the possibility of a drought -- even the call for voluntary conservation measures -- is a useful reminder that nature entirely calls the tune, something all too easy to forget on a balmy January afternoon. Where else would we get the 438 billion gallons of fresh water the city uses every year?</p>
        <p>The warm spell should end by the weekend, and more normal temperatures should return. While it's comforting to know that the warm weather will be back, we hope in season, there are no guarantees of a spring wet enough to fill the reservoirs. Now is the time to conserve water, when there are no lawns or gardens to irrigate, and when, by next week, the hose could be frozen anyway. The conservation measures that would be relatively painless now will be much harder to follow when April really comes.</p>
