        <p>After years of complaining about President Bill Clinton's use of a law to set aside scenic areas in the West as national monuments, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah said last night that he would ask President Bush to use the same law to create a protected area among the red rock canyons and bluffs of the San Rafael Swell in the central part of his state.</p>
        <p>In his State of the State address, Mr. Leavitt, a Republican, called on Mr. Bush to establish a 620,000-acre national monument, using the Antiquities Act, which does not mandate Congressional approval. The plan would allow off-road vehicles in much of the region, a move that environmental groups say would open it to damage and conflict with the intent of the designation.</p>

        <p>After years of complaining about President Bill Clinton's use of a law to set aside scenic areas in the West as national monuments, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah said last night that he would ask President Bush to use the same law to create a protected area among the red rock canyons and bluffs of the San Rafael Swell in the central part of his state.</p>
        <p>In his State of the State address, Mr. Leavitt, a Republican, called on Mr. Bush to establish a 620,000-acre national monument, using the Antiquities Act, which does not mandate Congressional approval. The plan would allow off-road vehicles in much of the region, a move that environmental groups say would open it to damage and conflict with the intent of the designation.</p>
        <p>''It would be a real dilution of the Antiquities Act to create a monument to off-road vehicles,'' Heidi McIntosh of the Southern Utah Wilderness Association said. ''Still, there may be workable solution there. It's going to be a litmus test for President Bush.''</p>
        <p>In his campaign, Mr. Bush criticized how Mr. Clinton created 11 monuments, the most by any president since Theodore Roosevelt. Republicans, including Mr. Leavitt, called the monuments ''land grabs'' that did not have the approval of county and state governments.</p>
        <p>Congressional leaders from Utah were particularly upset over Mr. Clinton's creation in 1996 of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, and they worked, unsuccessfully, to overturn it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt's proposal has the support of commissioners in Emery County, site of the swell. The county has fought plans to create a wilderness of more than 1.2 million acres, with the swell at the center.</p>
        <p>The new proposal is ''a locally driven solution,'' said Randy Johnson, a county commissioner. Mr. Johnson said the proposal, as outlined by the governor, would allow off-road vehicles on existing trails and roads. Environmental groups say that new trails can be illegally created in the desert area of the swell and that it would be hard to establish what is off limits.</p>
        <p>The monument would be on land that the Bureau of Land Management now controls.</p>
