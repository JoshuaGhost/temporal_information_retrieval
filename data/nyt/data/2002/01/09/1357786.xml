        <p>Recollection  As big as life, 85 color photographs of emergency workers, survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 go on view today in ''Faces of Ground Zero,'' a free exhibition through Jan. 20 in Vanderbilt Hall in Grand Central Terminal. The 9-by-4-foot framed portraits, including one of Rudolph W. Giuliani, then mayor, were taken by Joe McNally, the Life photographer, with a 12-by-16-by-12-foot Polaroid camera (about the size of a one-car garage) and a lens from a U-2 spy plane.</p>
        <p>Women's Voices  A search for plays by Islamic women that was begun last spring by Lucinda Kidder, a candidate for a master's degree in fine arts at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, will reach fruition at 8 p.m. tomorrow in ''Unexpected Journeys: Plays by Women Influenced by Muslim Cultures.'' Through Jan. 27, these works by women from Armenia, Australia, Britain, Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey and the United States will be presented in two staged productions and five readings in the Sixth Immigrant Theater Festival at the Tenement Theater, 97 Orchard Street, near Broome Street on the Lower East Side. Only one of the seven plays has been performed previously in the United States.</p>

        <p>Chez Renoir  Surrounded by women, he will pass the days from tomorrow through Feb. 24 in Atlanta. He is Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), who is taking up temporary residence at the High Museum of Art. Renoir will be present in the form of a self-portrait. Accompanying him will be four of his paintings of women: ''Mme. Claude Monet Reading,'' ''A Girl With a Fan,'' ''Marie Thérèse Durand-Ruel Sewing'' and ''At the Concert.'' The title of this exhibition tells much: ''A Passion for Renoir: Five Great Paintings From the Clark Art Institute.'' The works are lent by the institute in Williamstown, Mass.</p>
        <p>Continuation  During the 1990-91 Carnegie Hall centennial season, the renowned choral director Robert Shaw founded the Carnegie Hall Choral Workshop. Though he died in 1999, the workshop continues. Intended for choral directors and singers, orchestral conductors and music administrators who audition for the chance to study a masterpiece of choral repertory, it consists of five days of study and training that culminate in a performance. At 8 p.m. Saturday in Carnegie Hall, the 12th annual workshop, with more than 100 participants, will conclude when André Previn leads Brahms's ''German Requiem.'' Besides the chorus, the participants will include the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the soprano Barbara Bonney and the bass-baritone David Wilson-Johnson.</p>
