        <p>Tina Terada-Santos and Jerry Santos have plenty of reasons to be glad to work at the Microsoft Corporation, chief among them that it was on their very first day of orientation -- Sept. 5, 2000 -- that they met, and fell in love. They were married 11 months later.</p>

The company has huge amounts of cash on hand, new products like the Xbox game system and the Windows XP operating system are selling well, and the company appears to be on the verge of settling a major part of its antitrust battle with the federal government and several states.</p>

        <p>Tina Terada-Santos and Jerry Santos have plenty of reasons to be glad to work at the Microsoft Corporation, chief among them that it was on their very first day of orientation -- Sept. 5, 2000 -- that they met, and fell in love. They were married 11 months later.</p>
        <p>While the software behemoth's campus here was the setting for their own love story, it is also proving to be a good place for them to hold employment in this turbulent economy. Microsoft's stock was the best performer in 2001 among the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, rising 53 percent to $66.25, after a dismal year in 2000 in which it lost more than 60 percent of its value. The company has huge amounts of cash on hand, new products like the Xbox game system and the Windows XP operating system are selling well, and the company appears to be on the verge of settling a major part of its antitrust battle with the federal government and several states.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft just feels like the best place to be, more so than ever before,'' said Ms. Terada-Santos, 35, a program manager in the company's customer and partner loyalty group.</p>
        <p>There are certainly elements of optimism here in Microsoft's hometown, and several company employees who say they might once have been tempted to leave for a high-tech start-up said they were grateful to hold what appeared to be very steady employment with the industry giant, even if it no longer seemed to be minting multimillionaires by the month. The rebound in stock prices helped Microsoft employees, many of whom receive stock as an major part of their compensation.</p>
        <p>But there is hardly any widespread sense of jubilation, not with the regional economy still mired in  difficulties, or with Boeing undergoing major layoffs and many Internet companies struggling, or with Washington State facing one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. And even the Santoses are taking ''a very cautious approach'' to their personal finances, said Mr. Santos, 32, a technical writer in the company's ''dot-net'' division, which is part of its strategy to shift much of its software from packaged products to services available over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The couple are putting off a renovation to the house they moved into after their wedding, and delaying buying a new car. ''We're not fearful of losing our jobs, but we just don't want to take any big chances with our finances,'' Ms. Terada-Santos said. Microsoft has not experienced widespread layoffs.</p>
        <p>For others in the high-tech industry, the broader question was whether any rising tide at Microsoft might lift other boats. Some felt it would.</p>
        <p>''As Microsoft gets better, the market will get better,'' said Jeff Grant, 27, a Web site administrator here who has been a contract employee at several local companies over the last five years, who is to be laid off from his job next month. Despite the prospect of becoming a human figure in the unemployment statistics here, Mr. Grant was optimistic that he could find another job.</p>
        <p>''Once Microsoft stock went bad, a lot of other companies seemed to go down too,'' Mr. Grant said. ''But I think it would follow that if Microsoft is headed up, eventually the whole tech sector will rise up.''</p>
        <p>Sam Iredale, 29, a software test engineer, said he also saw reasons for optimism, after a time in which investors grew skittish over investing in the high-tech economy. ''I think things went to different extremes,'' he said. ''For a while, it seems they'd put money into just about anything that was a dot-com. They didn't discriminate. A lot of things were clearly overvalued. But now a lot of companies are clearly undervalued, and I think that investors are figuring out that not every tech company is out here on a wing and a prayer, so things are looking up.''</p>
        <p>But others who are not facing immediate layoffs said they were having a hard time detecting any major positive shifts in the economy.</p>
        <p>''It's simply very tough,'' said Mike Nuccio, 41, a sales manager based in Redmond for Isomedia, which provides a range of Internet services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nuccio sells some compact-disk products, and he said his company faced constant pressure from customers to cut prices. His lament was similar to that of Fran Traxler, the assistant manager at Diva Décor, a store here that sells home-decoration products.</p>
        <p>''If you don't have a sign out front saying you're having a big sale, then forget it,'' Ms. Traxler said. ''People are really looking for bargains, and they're not doing a lot of huge home-renovation projects anyway.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Traxler said that she was already seeing the effects of the Boeing layoffs -- which are expected to claim 20,000 jobs or more in the Seattle area -- and that if there was any upturn at Microsoft, it was not offsetting the other bad economic news in any obvious way. ''I do have a fair number of people who come in the store and look around,'' she said, ''but then they come up to the counter and say, ah, I just lost my job. Are you taking applications?''</p>
