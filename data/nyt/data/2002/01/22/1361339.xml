        <p>David Wiesner, the author and illustrator of one previous Caldecott Medal winner for children's book illustration and a Caldecott Honor Book, or runner-up, was named winner of the 2002 Caldecott Medal for his postmodern version of ''The Three Little Pigs'' (Clarion Books/Houghton Mifflin).

        <p>David Wiesner, the author and illustrator of one previous Caldecott Medal winner for children's book illustration and a Caldecott Honor Book, or runner-up, was named winner of the 2002 Caldecott Medal for his postmodern version of ''The Three Little Pigs'' (Clarion Books/Houghton Mifflin). The announcement of the prestigious children's publishing awards was made at the midwinter meeting of the American Library Association in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Wiesner's account the elegantly drawn pigs are well aware that they are in an arbitrary setting, and they escape from the book into nursery rhymes and fairy tales.</p>
        <p>The Newbery Medal for children's literature went to Linda Sue Park for her novel ''A Single Shard'' (Clarion Books/Houghton Mifflin), set in 12th-century Korea, about Tree-ear, an orphan living under a bridge, who becomes involved with a community of potters making the classic celadon ware. Ms. Park has written other historical novels for children set in Korea in the 15th and 17th centuries.</p>
        <p>The committees of librarians who make the selections operate independently, and it is unusual for both top prizes to be given to the same publishing imprint. In 1994 both the Newbery and Caldecott medal books were published by Houghton Mifflin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiesner, whose style is consistent only in its offbeat wit, won the 1992 Caldecott Medal for ''Tuesday,'' and his ''Sector Seven'' was one of four Honor Books in 2000.</p>
        <p>This year three Caldecott Honor Books were named: ''Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,'' illustrated by Bryan Collier, written by Doreen Rappaport and published by Jump at the Sun/Hyperion Books for Children; ''The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins: An Illuminating History of Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, Artist and Lecturer,'' illustrated by Brian Selznick and written by Barbara Kerley (Scholastic), and ''The Stray Dog,'' illustrated and written by Marc Simont (HarperCollins).</p>
        <p>Two Newbery Honor Books were named: ''Everything on a Waffle'' by Polly Horvath (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) and ''Carver: A Life in Poems'' by Marilyn Nelson (Front Street).</p>
        <p>The principal Coretta Scott King Awards went to Mildred D. Taylor for her novel ''The Land'' (Phyllis Fogelman Books/Penguin Putnam), a prequel to her novels about the Logan family that begin with ''Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,'' and to Jerry Pinkney for his illustrations to ''Goin' Someplace Special,'' an autobiographical story by Patricia McKissack about going alone to the public library in Memphis (Anne Schwartz/Atheneum).</p>
        <p>The Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature for young adults went to a first novel, ''A Step From Heaven,'' by An Na (Front Street). It is is a coming-of-age account of a young girl in a traditional Korean family who have moved to the United States. The Robert F. Sibert Award for an informational book for children went to ''Black Potatoes: The Story of the Great Irish Famine 1845-1850'' (Houghton Mifflin).</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 23, 2002, Wednesday  An article yesterday about children's book awards omitted the first word in the title of a Caldecott Honor Book. It is ''Martin's Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.''</p>
