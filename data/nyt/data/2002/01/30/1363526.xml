        <p>American and Filipino military officials appear to have worked out last-minute differences that threatened to delay the start of joint operations to battle armed Muslims in the southern Philippines who are suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, an American military spokeswoman said logistical problems might stall the start of the mission by more than a week.

        <p>American and Filipino military officials appear to have worked out last-minute differences that threatened to delay the start of joint operations to battle armed Muslims in the southern Philippines who are suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, an American military spokeswoman said logistical problems might stall the start of the mission by more than a week. But it appeared that the real issues were the role of the more than 660 American troops -- including 160 members of Special Operations forces -- who will assist Filipinos, and how to describe the mission.</p>
        <p>Filipino officials have sought assurances that Americans would not engage in combat while advising Filipino troops on Basilan island. The Philippine Constitution prohibits using foreign troops for combat, but American troops would be under orders to fire in self-defense.</p>
        <p>To avoid inflaming domestic sensitivities, Philippine officials have insisted on calling the mission an exercise or war game, one American military officer said. The United States, however, says the mission is a training operation against a real enemy. A compromise was reached to allow each side to call it what they wanted, the officer said.</p>
        <p>By later today, the logistical, legal and semantic hurdles vanished, and the mission appeared ready to begin on Thursday, one day behind schedule. A Filipino commander, Brig. Gen. Emmanuel Teodosio, told reporters in Zamboanga, the staging area for the mission, that the threatened delay ''has been resolved.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the the United States Pacific Command, Maj. Sean Gibson, said lawyers and other officials at the command in Hawaii were reviewing last-minute changes in documents governing details of the mission, specifically on how Americans' roles were defined.</p>
        <p>As American and Filipino troops geared up to battle the Muslim rebel group known as Abu Sayyaf, the commander of United States forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis C. Blair, underscored the Pentagon's broader role in the war on terror.</p>
        <p>''The focus of our activities is to make sure that Asia is not the last bastion of Al Qaeda, but to make it as inhospitable for terrorists to come here as possible,'' Admiral Blair said at a news conference in Singapore.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Admiral Blair said the mission in the Philippines illustrated how in Asia, the United States military would support friendly governments fighting terrorists, rather than take a more direct combat role as it has in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>''This next phase of the war I think is going to be much more a case of cooperating with countries in order to root out the terrorist infrastructure and terrorist organizations that are there,'' Admiral Blair said in an interview with Singapore's Channel News Asia.</p>
        <p>''Combating terrorist insurgent groups like the Abu Sayyaf Group is a complex operation,'' the admiral said. ''You need equipment, you need intelligence, you need training, you need good tactical doctrine and so on. Our effort is to assist the Philippines in that area. There's no question that this is a Philippine operation.''</p>
        <p>Admiral Blair said American military involvement in the fight against Abu Sayyaf would last ''months but not years.''</p>
