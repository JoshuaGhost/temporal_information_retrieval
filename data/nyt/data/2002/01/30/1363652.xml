        <p>A cement-additive plant that local groups say pollutes their neighborhood passed its first annual emissions test since opening in June, the state said yesterday. The plant passed what is known as a stack test, which was administered in October and certified last week, said Amy Collings, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection. The department was the defendant in a lawsuit filed by black and Hispanic groups charging the department with ''environmental racism'' for allowing operation of the plant, owned by St. Lawrence Cement Group. A federal appeals panel dismissed the suit on Jan. 16. The groups have not yet decided whether to appeal.</p>
