        <p>Following is a transcript of Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum's inaugural address yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Today we stand in a different New York, different from the one when I began this very tough campaign. A New York that has been terribly damaged and cruelly wounded and yet, in many ways, is stronger than ever. How lucky we are to be citizens of this great city.</p>
        <p>I begin the new term and the new year by remembering Sept. 11. We will always know what we were doing that morning and mourn those who sacrificed so much, especially the ones who offered their lives in service to this city. I take this opportunity to thank them. We honor their sacrifice and that of their families. We are very, very fortunate in New York to have such heroic public servants.</p>
        <p>In memory of the lost, I pledge to make the office of public advocate work for all of you. We must remember the fallen by working together to rebuild this wonderful city.</p>
        <p>One valuable legacy of the tragedy is the tremendous reservoir of good will among New Yorkers. We all want to lend a hand in rebuilding our home. I intend to use my office to tap into this good will, to offer New Yorkers a way, according to their talents and abilities, to pitch and speed our recovery.</p>
        <p>I want to thank Mayor Giuliani for preparing the way by being a great leader and a symbol of the best in our city to people throughout the world. Mr. Mayor, you have set a high standard, one that we in the new administration will have to work hard to equate.</p>
        <p>I pledge to help our new mayor. Where is he? Oh, there he is. Mayor Mike, who has spoken so eloquently this morning. I know how difficult the path is ahead of you. My job is to be your partner not adversary in your work to make a better life for all New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>I look forward to working with the City Council and Comptroller Thompson. We must be together if we are to make this city better.</p>
        <p>For my part, I pledge to you to have the public advocate be a watchdog over city services.</p>
        <p>I also will have the public advocate be your ombudswoman. Thank you. That's by way of saying that you can turn to my office with your problems and we will work with you to solve them.</p>
        <p>As I pledged in my campaign, I will not forget that the education of our children must be improved. I will work hard to fix our way of building our schools. I will also make sure that all New Yorkers know how to get the benefits that are rightfully theirs: health insurance for the elderly, the young and the poor and, of course, support for the families of victims of Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>I want to thank my husband, Victor, my family, my friends, my supporters, who stuck with me during this really tough campaign. I thank you here for being with us today at the beginning of our journey. Working together we can make our city an even more exciting and more vital place.</p>
        <p>I thank you for your trust. I will work every day to earn it. Happy new year.</p>
