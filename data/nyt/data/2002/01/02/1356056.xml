        <p>New Visions for the Site</p>
        <p>So is Times Square better now that the smoke-blowing camel and the kung fu movies are gone? It is one of those seemingly perennial questions about New York. But last year, in the mulling-over that habitually occurs at year's end, there was another question: What should be built where the World Trade Center once was?</p>
        <p>In a radio program called ''New York State of Mind'' on WNYC yesterday, several people had answers. FRANK McCOURT, taped during a discussion in November at the 92nd Street Y, said the site should become a university dedicated to the pursuit of peace.</p>

        <p>New Visions for the Site</p>
        <p>So is Times Square better now that the smoke-blowing camel and the kung fu movies are gone? It is one of those seemingly perennial questions about New York. But last year, in the mulling-over that habitually occurs at year's end, there was another question: What should be built where the World Trade Center once was?</p>
        <p>In a radio program called ''New York State of Mind'' on WNYC yesterday, several people had answers. FRANK McCOURT, taped during a discussion in November at the 92nd Street Y, said the site should become a university dedicated to the pursuit of peace.</p>
        <p>The novelist JONATHAN LETHEM, in a separate interview, proposed a memorial to all the city's architectural auld lang syne. ''Of course, the exterior would have to be Penn Station,'' he told the show's producer, JUDITH KAMPFNER. ''And then inside, you would be able to go from Dave's Egg Cream Parlor to the Thalia to Joe's Bar to whatever's been torn down, and you would have this mall of vanished New York spaces.''</p>
        <p>ADAM GOPNIK, who writes for The New Yorker, said the best idea he had heard came from his son, Luke, who proposed a giant statue of a firefighter, to be called the Statue of Bravery. ''I could imagine the Statue of Liberty dating the Statue of Bravery,'' Mr. Gopnik said. ''Which is the other thing the city's built on. Perpetual coupling and monumental liberty and bravery. What could be better?''</p>
        <p>6 Men and a Squeegee</p>
        <p>One of the more amazing escapes from the World Trade Center led to, well, one of the more remarkable celebrations recently. JAN DEMCZUR, JOHN PACZKOWSKI, GEORGE PHOENIX, COLIN RICHARDSON and AL SMITH had last been in the same place on the morning of Sept. 11. Along with a sixth man, SHIVAM IYER, they were trapped on the 50th floor of One World Trade Center, inside an express elevator.</p>
        <p>Once they had pried open the elevator doors, they faced three inches of wallboard. The only tool at hand was a squeegee carried by Mr. Demczur, a window washer. Using its metal blade, the men took turns slicing into the wall, then broke through white tiles -- the elevator had stopped outside a bathroom -- and crawled under a sink. They cleared the building with only a few minutes to spare.</p>
        <p>In Oakland, Calif., PAT MURPHY read an account in The New York Times about their escape and had a hunch. He is the president of Ettore Products, a leading manufacturer of the squeegee, which was invented by the company's founder, Ettore Steccone, in 1936. Sure enough, Mr. Demczur's window-washing company, ABM Industries, bought its squeegees from Ettore, including the one that saved the lives of six people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy and the chairman of Ettore, MICHAEL SMAHLIK, gave a dinner last month at the Union Pacific restaurant in Manhattan reuniting the escapees. Each man received a handsome full-size squeegee. But that was not all. Each also got a gold lapel squeegee pin, studded with diamonds. The company also made a gift of $10,000 to relief funds.</p>
        <p>It was a grand gesture. But being in New York is enough to put any squeegee man in a grand mood. The city's great skyscrapers, Mr. Smahlik said, provoke one sweet thought: ''All that glass.''</p>
