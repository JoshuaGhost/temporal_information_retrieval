        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re the Facing Off column ''On the Front Line in the O.R.; Can Specially Trained Nurses Safely Administer Anesthesia Without Physician Supervision?'' (Jan. 8):</p>
        <p>I am a registered nurse with 20 years of operating room experience. I have worked with both nurse anesthetists and physician  anesthesiologists.</p>
        <p>I have worked in rural hospitals and large urban hospitals. I have observed thousands of anesthetics' being administered by both practitioners. When I became a patient and needed surgery, I requested a nurse anesthetist.</p>
        <p>The care given by nurse anesthetists is equal to that of a physician, with one exception: it is personal and attentive.</p>
        <p>The nursing school background is a plus; it adds a human element.  I have worked with anesthesiologists in training, and I actually heard one say that he went into anesthesia so that he wouldn't have to talk with patients.</p>
        <p>He left the anesthetized patient unattended to walk over to tell me this.</p>
        <p>Nurses are trained to be patient advocates.</p>
