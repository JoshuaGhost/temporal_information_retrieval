        <p>RECENTLY, within a week of each other, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall announced their programs for the 2002-3 season. But those looking for indicators of the artistic visions of the new leaders at each institution will have to wait a year or so. Though the conductor Lorin Maazel officially takes charge of the Philharmonic with the opening concerts in September, a large segment of next season's programs, including four of the five commissioned works that will be given premieres, were already planned by the departing Kurt Masur and his artistic team. Similarly, though Robert Harth has been the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall since last September, most of next season's offerings were arranged by his two predecessors: not just the embattled Franz Xaver Ohnesorg but also the well-regarded Judith Arron, who died in 1998.</p>
        <p>Prior expectations seem to have affected the general reaction to the announcements. Mr. Maazel has never been known as a risk taker, so not much in the way of innovative programming and contemporary fare was expected of him. That he has exceeded expectations is encouraging and important. But the Philharmonic's season hardly represents an abundance of premieres and fresh repertory, as some have suggested.</p>

        <p>RECENTLY, within a week of each other, the New York Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall announced their programs for the 2002-3 season. But those looking for indicators of the artistic visions of the new leaders at each institution will have to wait a year or so. Though the conductor Lorin Maazel officially takes charge of the Philharmonic with the opening concerts in September, a large segment of next season's programs, including four of the five commissioned works that will be given premieres, were already planned by the departing Kurt Masur and his artistic team. Similarly, though Robert Harth has been the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall since last September, most of next season's offerings were arranged by his two predecessors: not just the embattled Franz Xaver Ohnesorg but also the well-regarded Judith Arron, who died in 1998.</p>
        <p>Prior expectations seem to have affected the general reaction to the announcements. Mr. Maazel has never been known as a risk taker, so not much in the way of innovative programming and contemporary fare was expected of him. That he has exceeded expectations is encouraging and important. But the Philharmonic's season hardly represents an abundance of premieres and fresh repertory, as some have suggested.</p>
        <p>Conversely, Carnegie Hall audiences have come to expect an exciting balance of adventurous contemporary music and standard repertory played by esteemed international ensembles. Every aspect of Mr. Ohnesorg's heavy-handed tenure came in for criticism except his programming, which essentially continued Arron's approach. So Mr. Harth and his team deserve credit just for keeping it going.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel and the Philharmonic begin the season on Sept. 11 by acknowledging the sad anniversary of the terrorist attacks with a memorial performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, preceded by a short commissioned work yet to be announced. Though a worthy gesture, it would have been more meaningful had Mr. Maazel decided to repeat the new work for the official season opener on Sept. 18, rather than substitute Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3.</p>
        <p>Among other notable premieres, in December Mr. Maazel will conduct ''The Enchanted Warrior,'' a major Philharmonic commission, an evening-long oratorio for chorus and orchestra by the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin. It must be said, though, that Mr. Shchedrin, an unabashed neo-Romantic, is no cutting-edge innovator. Another Philharmonic commission that Mr. Maazel will conduct in June is Oliver Knussen's Symphony No. 4, which could be an important premiere if the piece actually gets written. Mr. Knussen, a formidably gifted composer, is becoming one of Britain's busiest conductors, and he routinely struggles to complete commissions on time. Don't be surprised if the new symphony turns out to be a single movement of, say, 11 minutes, half of it recycled from some existing Knussen opera or chamber work.</p>
        <p>It's gratifying that two younger American conductors, either of whom might have been a dynamic choice as the Philharmonic's music director, are introducing recent works by brilliant composers of their own generation who have not gotten enough attention in New York. David Robertson will conduct the United States premiere of ''Listening Earth'' by the fabulously inventive Danish composer Poul Ruders in February; and Robert Spano, finally making his Philharmonic debut, will conduct the New York premiere of ''Chateau de l'Âme'' by the inspired Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho in May.</p>
        <p>Among other intriguing works should be a premiere of a piece by Bright Sheng and Philharmonic premieres of works by Henri Dutilleux and Toru Takemitsu. But only in the conservative field of classical music would it merit special note that some 65 percent of the composers being performed by the Philharmonic next season did most their work in the 20th century. So Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto (1921) counts as a contemporary work? Would productions of O'Neill's ''Anna Christie'' (1920) or Shaw's ''Saint Joan'' (1923) ever be seen as evidence of a theater company's commitment to bold contemporary drama?</p>
        <p>It's easier for a presenting institution like Carnegie Hall to achieve balance with its programming than it is for a resident urban orchestra. Carnegie can bring in the London Philharmonic under the direction of Mr. Masur to perform Beethoven, Bruckner, Strauss and Prokofiev one week, and the Orchestre National de Lyon under Mr. Robertson to perform Berg, Boulez, Webern, Ravel and Stravinsky another week.</p>
        <p>Yet the artistic team at Carnegie has a way of emboldening even mainstream orchestras and artists to include recent works in their programs. For example, Bernard Haitink and the Boston Symphony are bringing John Harbison's Requiem for its New York premiere in March. Moreover, Carnegie Hall has been undertaking big, expensive projects on behalf of music by living composers. It will do so in late March, when Pierre Boulez and the Ensemble Intercontemporain present a rare performance of Mr. Boulez's ''Répons'' for which the seats in the parquet will be removed, allowing the orchestra to be placed in the middle of the floor, encircled by the audience. The Philharmonic used to do that kind of thing regularly when Mr. Boulez was in charge.</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic argues that it must be especially attentive to the tastes of its regular subscribers, who do not want too much unsettling new music. But Michael Tilson Thomas at the San Francisco Symphony, for one, has used his considerable charisma to get subscribers excited about contemporary music. If old-timers are lost along the way, so be it. That orchestra has been luring younger concertgoers into the hall to make up the difference.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Maazel is to have an artistic impact at the Philharmonic, he will have to spend most of his time away from the podium dealing with that challenge.</p>
