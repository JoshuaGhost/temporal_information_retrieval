        <p>President Bush said he would seek $48 billion in new spending on the military, the biggest increase since Ronald Reagan's Pentagon buildup two decades ago and the centerpiece of the $2 trillion budget Mr. Bush sends to Congress early next month. It will also seek a doubling of funding for domestic security and money for an economic recovery package, including tax cuts. It will also call for cuts and freezes in social, health and environmental programs -- and will project budget deficits for the next several years.</p>
