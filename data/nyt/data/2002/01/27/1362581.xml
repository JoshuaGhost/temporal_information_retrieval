        <p>In ''The Apartment,'' Billy Wilder's 1960 tribute to character, the accountant C.C. Baxter overcomes temptation and does what he knows is right. ''Loyal, resourceful, cooperative C.C.

        <p>In ''The Apartment,'' Billy Wilder's 1960 tribute to character, the accountant C.C. Baxter overcomes temptation and does what he knows is right. ''Loyal, resourceful, cooperative C.C. Baxter,'' one of his bosses says with a twist to his voice at once soothing and menacing, ''you don't want to louse yourself up.'' The boss wants to borrow the apartment for an affair. But in the end, Baxter says no. He gives up a lot -- money, power, the key to the executive washroom -- but he saves his soul. He keeps his self-respect.</p>
        <p>The comparison to what went on at Arthur Andersen recently is obvious. The accountants at Andersen might have refused to certify Enron's financial statements but didn't. They decided they had too much at stake -- $52 million a year in business, according to one report. And now the damage goes far beyond the $61 billion in Enron shareholder value that disappeared in less than a year.</p>
        <p>The accountant is supposed to be our superego, the guy who suggests that you don't really need that last drink before you hit the road and takes your keys if you insist on having it. Now that doctors are just employees and lawyers regularly cross over to run the businesses they're paid to counsel, the accountant occupies a unique place, not just in the professional world, but in the psychology of the country. His green eye shade is supposed to be the new backward collar.</p>
        <p>Forgive me, for I have speculated.</p>
        <p>I absolve you of all debts. Go put thy money in investment-grade bonds.</p>
        <p>The priest is supposed to convert the sinner. The Andersen-Enron relationship seems to have gone the other way: Enron loosened Andersen up. It showed it a good time. It diluted Andersen's culture by filling its top ranks with Andersen people -- seven in one year. But Andersen wanted to be corrupted. It had recently fought and lost a bitter divorce from its consulting arm, now named Accenture. It still wanted to join the fast crowd, though. It didn't want to be in the business it was in.</p>
        <p>And it still doesn't. Here's Andersen's description of what it does on its Web site: ''Convergence: We help you navigate the forces of change.'' And here's Ernst &amp; Young, another Big Five accounting firm: ''Welcome to Ernst &amp; Young. Your source for global business solutions.'' In fact, all of the Big Five firms strain not to mention on their home pages what they actually do. You have to look hard to find the dread A word: accounting.</p>
        <p>Why does no one want to be an accountant anymore? Some of it, fittingly, has to do with numbers. Accounting today is a mug's game, perhaps uniquely so among professional tasks. Your fee is limited, but your liability is not. And to be fair, modern financial companies are difficult to figure out, Enron, with its high-flying finance, more so than most. How many accountants understand derivatives or futures contracts?</p>
        <p>But the omissions on the Web sites, with their whiff of shame, seem to go beyond that. Accountants are clearly out of style, even among accountants. School admissions dropped 25 percent in the last four years. Some speak of a ''crisis in accounting.'' W. David Albrecht, a professor of accounting at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who runs a Web site, is among them. It's not hard to make him for a member of the profession -- skinny, stooped, with russet hair and mustache, he peers into a computer screen with the words ''I love acctng'' on it. He knows that the culture has turned against him. Even the admissions committee at Bowling Green, he says, avoids the stereotypical accounting candidate in its search for future titans of economies yet unborn: ''In the current environment, people think they don't need bookkeepers. They don't need number crunchers.'' They want financial leaders that ''people who come into contact with will respect.'' But ''accounting students tend to be the same kinds of people as always, people who were attracted to bookkeeping in high school,'' Albrecht says. ''They like keeping track of things.'' He considers the talent ''essential.''</p>
        <p>Don't expect things to turn around, though. Accounting is a lonely task -- refusing to go along doesn't get you the girl the way C.C. Baxter gets Miss Kubelik; that's just Hollywood -- made lonelier by the fact that in the last 30 years notions of moral and market value have been flipping around. What can an accountant make of the S.E.C.'s shutting off whenever a Republican administration comes into power and then turning back on like a light bulb with the Democrats? It's like being a cop when half the time the D.A. is on vacation.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is now redrafting the rules under which accountants operate, though its chairman, Harvey Pitt, is still resisting doing what it will take. Whatever comes to pass in Washington, it will still be hard for accountants. They will need encouragement. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is trying. It's planning a campaign to market the profession. And Professor Albrecht is doing his small part on his Web site, where he lists films that portray accountants in a positive light -- The Apartment,'' of course, and ''Look Who's Talking'' and ''Nick of Time,'' in which Kirstie Alley and Johnny Depp ''play characters who just happen to be accountants.'' Let's hope their efforts succeed. Accounting has been around for a long time -- some of the first writings were those of Sumerian accountants. And we need their descendants now. Because our culture is not going back where it came from. There will be more Enrons, more New Economy booms and busts. Money is going to become increasingly unreal in the coming years, and it would be a good thing if C.C. Baxter were around to help us keep track of it.</p>
