        <p>With money market yields dropping to record lows, several money market funds have cut their fees to ensure that investors do not lose money.</p>
        <p>The Invesco Funds Group, Nations Funds and Pioneer Investments have all reduced the expenses they charge to investors, keeping their yields in positive territory.</p>
        <p>Many investors treat money market funds as bank accounts, at least in part because the value of the funds' shares has  never declined. Unlike bank accounts, however, they are not insured, and their yields have declined sharply over the last year. Short-term interest rates have plummeted as a result of 11 rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>The average yield on taxable money market funds reached a record low of 1.51 percent last week, and tax-free funds fell to 0.92 percent, according to iMoneyNet Inc. of Westborough, Mass.</p>
        <p>The average expense ratio of a money-market fund is 0.61 percent, it said, but expenses charged by some funds threatened to cause losses for the first time.</p>
        <p>So far, at least, no company has been willing to let that happen.</p>
        <p>The Pioneer Cash Reserves fund, for example, which had charged expenses of 1.02 percent to 2 percent on its share classes, lowered its management fee last week by 0.1 percentage point. Its yield is now 0.33 percent, and Pioneer, a unit of UniCredito Italiano, will cut expenses further if needed to keep returns positive, the company says.</p>
