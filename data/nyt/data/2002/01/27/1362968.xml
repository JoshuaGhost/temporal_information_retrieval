        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read ''Comcast's High-Speed Web Access, the Bored Game'' (Jersey, Jan. 20) with great amusement, and frustration. Since Dec. 27, I have had either intermittent or no service from Comcast. I've sent six e-mails to various customer support addresses and the only response I've gotten is that they are not going to answer because of the high volume of e-mail.  They refer to a phone number that I have tried three or four times and gave up after 15 or 20 minutes of holding. Perhaps the most frustrating issue is that I cannot contact a live person to tell my problems to. I can't wait to get the month's bill; then they will listen when I refuse to pay for the lack of service.</p>
