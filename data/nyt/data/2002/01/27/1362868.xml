        <p>As the center of gravity for New York State's population slips farther from the towns and farmlands upstate, the Republicans who control the State Senate, angling to keep their seats, plan to expand the chamber to 62 districts from 61.</p>
        <p>They have not yet made that plan public, and already there are cries that carrying it out would be illegal. The problem is that determining what is allowable is akin to divination, and the answer is tangled in a legal thicket that prompts even experts to shake their heads and mutter, ''Only in New York.''</p>
        <p>The one thing that appears certain is that the method of redrawing New York's legislative districts will land in court, just as it did in 1992, 1982 and 1972, and several times in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>A complex formula, written into the State Constitution 108 years ago, theoretically sets the number of Senate seats, but it is subject to several plausible interpretations. Layered atop it is a long series of convoluted court decisions -- rulings that are, to the eyes of the uninitiated and the experts alike, downright bizarre.</p>
        <p>Several Republican senators and aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, say it is certain that they will add a seat. The Republicans' public position is equivocal. ''I think we could go to 62, but nothing has been decided,'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican who is co-chairman of the Legislature's Redistricting Commission.</p>
        <p>Senate subplots include a border tussle between two Republican senators who want the same parts of Westchester County in their districts; hopes of creating a district based in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that a Republican might carry; and thoughts of carving up the Upper East Side district that was represented by Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican who resigned this month to take a job in the Bloomberg administration.</p>
        <p>Every 10 years, the Legislature must create new boundaries for the Assembly -- the Senate and the House of Representatives -- based on the most recent census. Traditionally, the majority party in each chamber of the Legislature draws the lines for that house. New York will lose two of its 31 seats in Congress this year, reflecting its declining share of the national population. The State Constitution fixes the Assembly at 150 districts.</p>
        <p>In a state that leans Democratic, the Republicans have an uneasy 36-to-25 hold on the Senate. It rests on their power to carve districts to their advantage, and their remarkable record of keeping control of seven mostly Democratic districts, despite a recent string of close calls.</p>
        <p>Demographic shifts over the last decade pose new problems for the Republicans. Relative to the statewide population, overwhelmingly Democratic New York City grew, and upstate New York shrank. Also, the traditional Republican advantage upstate and in the suburbs has waned, a change reflected in voter registrations and local elections.</p>
        <p>Keeping the Senate at 61 seats would mean adding one in the city and subtracting one upstate. Going to 62 seats could mean preserving all the upstate Republicans' districts, while still adding a district in the city.</p>
        <p>Expanding to 62 would also shrink each district, making it easier to gerrymander Republican-leaning districts in and around New York City by slicing the most Democratic areas out of them. That could be of particular help to Senator Guy J. Velella, a Republican whose district in the Bronx and Westchester is more than 2-to-1 Democratic. He and Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Westchester Republican, want some of the same areas around Yonkers and New Rochelle, and Mr. Velella would like to lose parts of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''We don't have many options in our area,'' Mr. Spano said. ''Westchester County is becoming more and more Democrat in registration, and the Bronx is very Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman is another Republican who was barely able to beat back recent challenges in a heavily Democratic district. Some Republicans say that if they lose a special election on Feb. 12 to replace him, they could give up trying to hold the district, and redraw it to prop up Mr. Velella, taking in a narrow band of mostly Republican pockets of the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Republicans also hope to carve out a swing district around Bay Ridge  that could go to a Republican.</p>
        <p>Critics of the 62-seat plan say it would violate the federal Voting Rights Act of 1964 by diluting the power of minority voters. Any redistricting plan for the Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn is subject to scrutiny under that law, the legacy of a 1970's lawsuit. It must be shown not to diminish minority influence, and must be approved by the Justice Department before going into effect.</p>
        <p>''If the minority seats go from 14 out of 61, to 14 out of 62, then that's an impermissible dilution of their influence,'' said Senator Martin Connor of Brooklyn, the Democratic minority leader, who is an election law expert.</p>
        <p>Officials of some minority groups, including the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, said they were prepared to sue if the Senate were expanded.</p>
        <p>Another complication is a string of federal court rulings over the last decade that make it harder to justify drawing districts that are based on race or have tortured shapes -- common practices in New York.</p>
        <p>As for the State Constitution and the relevant court decisions, it seems that no one knows quite what to make of them. ''We think we could go to 62, 63, even 68,'' Mr. Skelos said.</p>
        <p>Angelo Falcon, senior policy executive at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is closely following the redistricting process, said he could not make sense of the section of the Constitution on redistricting or of the court rulings interpreting it. ''I guess they do this on purpose,'' he said. ''The insiders can't even interpret it, so how can I? We operate in eight states, and we don't see anything like this, anything this hard to understand, anyplace else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Connor's take: ''It's weird.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Skelos concluded, ''If you had two accountants and two mathematicians in the room, they would come up with four different answers.''</p>
