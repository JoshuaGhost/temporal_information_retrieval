        <p>Four teenage boys pleaded not guilty in the killing of a 10-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed in November 2000 as he returned home to a rough housing project in southeast London from an after-school computer class. The slain boy, Damilola Taylor, a Nigerian immigrant who had been in London for just four months, bled to death after being stabbed in the leg in a deserted stairwell five minutes from his home. The trial of the three 16-year-olds and one 14-year-old is expected to last up to three months.</p>
