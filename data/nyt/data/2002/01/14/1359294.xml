        <p>The police in Northern Ireland arrested two men today in the slaying of Daniel McColgan, a Catholic mailman who was shot dead by Protestant gunmen on Saturday morning as he reported for work in the northern outskirts of Belfast.</p>
        <p>The Ulster Defense Association, the province's largest Protestant paramilitary organization, claimed responsibility for the killing, which it said was in retaliation for attacks on Protestant communities. A group calling itself the Red Hand Defenders, a cover name used by the U.D.A. and other Protestant paramilitary groups, had previously taken responsibility and had issued public death threats to Catholic postal workers and schoolteachers in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Postal workers across Northern Ireland refused to collect mail today and said they would not make deliveries on Monday out of respect for Mr. McColgan, his girlfriend and his infant daughter.</p>
        <p>Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, condemned the killing as ''barbaric'' and said the arrests represented ''some progress'' in the case, according to the Press Association, a British news service. Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland expressed concern on Saturday that few people had been arrested, despite evidence of concerted attacks by loyalists, the hard-line Protestants who seek to maintain Northern Ireland's link to the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>While the Ulster Defense Association has not officially called off a cease-fire that it declared in 1994, government authorities stopped recognizing the cease-fire during a rash of pipe-bomb attacks on Catholic homes last autumn. The sectarian killing of Mr. McColgan indicates the possibility of a return to regular operations for the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. McColgan's killing came after a week of riots in North Belfast.  More than 80 police officers and British Army soldiers were injured over two nights of heavy bombardment by stones, bottles and homemade explosives thrown by crowds of teenagers.</p>
        <p>The Red Hand Defenders' threat to Catholic teachers highlights how badly schools have suffered in Northern Ireland recently.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, Protestant residents scuffled with Catholic parents picking up their daughters from Holy Cross, a girls' Catholic elementary school in a Protestant neighborhood. The clash helped ignite the subsequent riots.</p>
        <p>Later, a gang of armed men smashed the windows of teachers' cars at another Catholic school.</p>
        <p>John Reid, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said that citizens must avoid reopening a chapter from the province's bloody history of sectarian conflict.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, it is people themselves who have got to realize there is no future in the past, and that sectarian hatred, division, bigotry -- the sort of attacks we're seeing -- will lead them nowhere except to the destruction of their own communities and the destruction of their younger generations,'' Mr. Reid told Sky News.</p>
