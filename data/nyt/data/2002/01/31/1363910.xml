        <p>The Nets (29-14) may be two games in front of the Milwaukee Bucks (27-16) in the Eastern Conference, but Nets Coach Byron Scott says his team's legitimacy as the conference leader hinges on defeating the Bucks tonight at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''I just think they're the team to beat in the East,'' Scott said yesterday after practice at the Champion Center in East Rutherford, N.J. ''If we want to get anything really, really accomplished this season, we're going to have to go through them.''</p>

        <p>The Nets (29-14) may be two games in front of the Milwaukee Bucks (27-16) in the Eastern Conference, but Nets Coach Byron Scott says his team's legitimacy as the conference leader hinges on defeating the Bucks tonight at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''I just think they're the team to beat in the East,'' Scott said yesterday after practice at the Champion Center in East Rutherford, N.J. ''If we want to get anything really, really accomplished this season, we're going to have to go through them.''</p>
        <p>On Dec. 8 the Bucks stampeded through the Nets for a 95-79 victory in Milwaukee as Ray Allen, Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson combined for 62 points and the team shot 48.8 percent. The Nets shot 33.3 percent in the game.</p>
        <p>''Even though it has been a while, no one has forgotten what happened in Milwaukee and the fact that we didn't play very well,'' center Todd MacCulloch said.</p>
        <p>The Bucks will come after their 109-90 drubbing Tuesday of the Celtics, giving them a 20-4 record in conference play. The Nets are 18-9 against the Eastern Conference teams.</p>

        <p>LEAGUE SUSPENDS WEBBER: Sacramento Kings forward Chris Webber was suspended yesterday for one game and fined $7,500 for deliberately throwing an elbow to the head of Utah's Jarron Collins last week.</p>
        <p>Webber will miss the Kings' game tonight against Seattle. He was called for a flagrant foul for hitting Collins last Saturday, and the National Basketball Association imposed the suspension. (AP)</p>
