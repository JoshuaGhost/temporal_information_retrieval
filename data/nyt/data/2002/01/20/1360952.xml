        <p>As the workers who lost their retirement savings in Enron stock demonstrated, Americans are not always the best investors. And sometimes their companies set up incentives that can make things worse.</p>
        <p>Many Enron workers saved mainly through their 401(k) retirement plans, and chose to keep their 401(k) money mostly or entirely in Enron stock. Financial advisers say it is wiser to choose a mix of investments.</p>
        <p>''It sounds so reasonable to diversify,'' said Elizabeth W. Jetton, who is president of Financial Vision Advisors in Atlanta and serves on the board of the Financial Planning Association. But many middle-class American investors ''tend to be extremists,'' either overlooking risk or investing too conservatively.</p>
        <p>Enron pushed them in this direction. Like many other big companies, it matched workers' 401(k) contributions only with its own stock. In addition, Enron's corporate culture encouraged employees to put their own contributions into company stock as well. Just before Enron collapsed, 60 percent of its 401(k) assets were reportedly held in its own shares.</p>
        <p>Most economists and financial planners recommend against holding much stock in the company that pays one's salary. But Enron was not the only company that offered incentives to do the opposite. General Motors' 401(k) plan for salaried workers offers 76 investment options, almost all of which are managed internally or by Fidelity Investments. Employees must, however, buy a dollar of G.M.'s own stock for each dollar they funnel to the other investment options, up to 3 percent of salary. G.M. matches a fifth of the first 6 percent of salary, also in stock. Workers must hold that stock until the end of the calendar year in which it is bought.</p>
        <p>Chuck Tschampion, managing director of defined-contribution plans at G.M.'s asset management division, said 20 to 25 percent of the money in G.M.'s 401(k) plan for salaried workers is typically in G.M. stock. In G.M.'s 401(k) for its hourly workers, who face no requirements for stockholding, only 10 to 15 percent of the assets are generally in company stock.</p>
        <p>Pension experts and financial advisers suggest several improvements on G.M.'s model. Lowell M. Smith Jr., a consultant at Invesmart on the laws governing retirement benefits, said that 401(k) plans could achieve a second level of diversification -- beyond having different types of investment options -- by having several different companies manage those options.</p>
        <p>Louis Berney, the editor of DC Pension Investing, an industry newsletter distributed by the Institute of Management and Administration, also recommended having fewer options, to avoid confusing employees. ''You don't need to have 80 funds that are offered'' to maintain a diversified portfolio, he said. ''That is more confusing than anything.''</p>
        <p>One possible model is Akzo-Nobel, the international chemical and pharmaceutical company. In addition to company stock, Akzo-Nobel's 401(k) offers nine investment funds and the option of a dynamic portfolio that changes automatically as an employee ages. Unlike G.M.'s funds, Akzo-Nobel's funds are run by four different firms: Fidelity, Franklin, Janus and Vanguard.</p>
        <p>The company matches its workers' 401(k) contributions 50 to 80 percent for the first 6 percent of salary. Employees are free to put all the money wherever they want. Jaime Erickson, Akzo-Nobel's manager of defined contribution plans, said that under 10 percent of the 401(k) assets were in the company's own stock.</p>
        <p>Most experts agree that telling investors about the benefits of diversification will help to protect them from big losses. ''Definitely the most important thing is to try to educate the participants as much as possible,'' said Mr. Berney.</p>
        <p>But Paul Yakoboski, director of policy research at the American Council of Life Insurers, worried that investors were ''not following the education that they're getting.'' He said that making it easier for independent financial advisers to enter the workplace, as proposed in a bill sponsored by Representative John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, would make more of a difference.</p>
        <p>A quarter-century ago, private pensions were managed virtually exclusively by employers and their appointed trustees. The rise of 401(k) plans has changed that picture dramatically.</p>
        <p>''It is quite fair to say that when it comes to saving for retirement, 401(k) is the main way that it's done nowadays,'' Mr. Yakoboski said. ''If you were to compare it to other vehicles, like I.R.A.'s, it's not even close.''</p>
        <p>Many Americans are ''relying so much on their 401(k) that they don't have savings anywhere else,'' Ms. Jetton said. ''It's sort of, 'I gave at the office.' ''</p>
        <p>Congress created 401(k) plans in the Revenue Act of 1978, with the intent that fat tax incentives and reassuring links to employers would encourage workers to save more for retirement.</p>
        <p>Until then, most companies offering pensions had guaranteed their retirees fixed levels of income, and had thus borne all the risks of the investments needed to generate that income. Businesses soon took advantage of the opportunity to shift those risks to their employees. Using 401(k) plans and other programs to promote workers' ownership of company stock was also thought to promote loyalty and drive up share prices.</p>
        <p>Between 1984 and 2000, 401(k) assets grew more than 20 percent a year, far outpacing all other types of pension plans. According to the Labor Department's most recent statistics, 401(k) plans now contain roughly $2 trillion in assets -- about two in five dollars of all pension wealth -- with over 42 million participants.</p>
        <p>''To a large extent, the shift has been in response to changes in the marketplace, in the economy, and in the work force,'' said Ann L. Combs, the assistant secretary of labor in charge of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. With skyrocketing stock prices and an increasingly mobile work force, she said, the allure of accounts that could be invested in the markets and carried between employers grew.</p>
        <p>Though many companies still offer traditional pensions as well as stock-ownership and profit-sharing programs, Mr. Berney said, 401(k) plans were becoming the major source of retirement income.</p>
        <p>The shift to 401(k) plans has highlighted Americans' abilities and shortcomings as investors. Mr. Smith said he had observed at least three types of investors. The most active are ''do-it-yourselfers'' who track and transact investments in the way day traders do. Then there are the ''validators'' who have a vague idea of their goals but want professional advice. Least active are those who have little understanding of the plans and invest in what they hope will be a conservative way.</p>
        <p>Day traders who take too many risks are more the exception than the rule, though, according to Mr. Yakoboski. ''401(k) participants are often very unsophisticated investors,'' he said. ''They're passive investors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berney warned that naïve investors could end up trying to follow overly conservative strategies. ''People underestimate how much they're going to need'' for retirement, he said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, what workers think is a safe strategy, like investing in the stock of a well-established employer, can turn out to be the opposite.</p>
        <p>''They don't realize they're taking the risk,'' Mr. Smith said. But the truth was harshly revealed at Enron and at Lucent Technologies, where 401(k) accounts also suffered big losses when the company's stock plunged.</p>
        <p>ENRON'S COLLAPSE: PENSIONS  Correction:  January 24, 2002, Thursday  An article on Sunday about companies that encourage employees to put 401(k) money into their own stock, and about financial planners' recommendations to diversify portfolios,  misstated the name of a newsletter whose editor, Louis Berney, recommended that plans combat confusion by offering fewer options.
