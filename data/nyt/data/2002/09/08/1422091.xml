        <p>With polls showing them in a near dead heat, Janet Reno and Bill McBride charged into a final weekend of hand-shaking and speech-making before the Democratic primary on Tuesday to determine which will take on Gov. Jeb Bush in November.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, the United States attorney general in the Clinton administration, began a marathon weekend of campaigning today here with a hearty breakfast of fried mullet and grits at Olean's Cafe. She mingled with the regulars, signing autographs and posing for pictures, before moving on to a farmers' market in her signature red truck.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno, who will attend church services and rallies on Sunday in Tampa and Orlando, has stepped up the pace of her campaign heading into the home stretch. If Ms. Reno, who is 64, is growing weary on the stump, she is not letting on.</p>
        <p>''When you can sit down and have a moment, you make the most out of it and then get up and move on,'' she said in an interview at Olean's.</p>
        <p>Mr. McBride, a wealthy Tampa lawyer, was keeping to a brisk pace himself this weekend. He began the day by arriving by private plane at a rally at Stetson University in DeLand, then flew 47 miles to Palatka, a blue-collar community on the St. Johns River that is a beehive of Democratic supporters.</p>
        <p>There, about 100 supporters greeted him in the shade of a 148-year-old oak. Next, he took in a football game between the University of Florida, his alma mater, and the University of Miami in Gainesville, where Ms. Reno and Governor Bush also had stops.</p>
        <p>''I had a couple of days where I felt, 'Gosh, my energy is gone,' but this morning I felt wonderful,'' Mr. McBride, who is 57, said of his busy campaign schedule. ''Maybe it is because we are doing so well.''</p>
        <p>Polls show Mr. McBride and Ms. Reno in a close contest, with a third contender, State Senator Daryl Jones, badly trailing. One poll shows Mr. McBride having pulled slightly ahead while another has Ms. Reno retaining a slim edge.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's camp dismisses the polls, saying they are not a true measure of her support. ''We think polls you always have to take with a grain of salt, and primary polls you take with a whole spoon of salt,'' said Nicole Harburger, her communications director.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harburger said her candidate had the name recognition, grass-roots support among staunch Democrats and the state's sizable population of elderly voters and strategic advantages that would enable her to win. Ms. Reno is widely popular among African-Americans and is expected to benefit from contested races involving black candidates in some areas of the state.</p>
        <p>A ballot initiative in Miami-Dade County to repeal an ordinance that protects gays from discrimination is expected to produce a high turnout among gay voters, with whom Ms. Reno is also popular.</p>
        <p>''We just need to meet as many people as possible,'' Ms. Reno said. ''We've had a good reception all up and down the state. I feel good about Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. McBride's campaign has clearly gained momentum in recent weeks, and state political experts now say he may very well win.</p>
        <p>''Things look dramatically different than just two or three weeks ago,'' said Aubrey Jewett, political science professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. ''Going back a few months, he was 40 or 50 points behind in the polls; now he's just two or three points behind. This comeback has just been remarkable.''</p>
        <p>Six months ago, Mr. McBride was a no-name political neophyte. But he has been methodical and focused in his approach to the campaign. He has concentrated on areas of the state with swing voters and undecided Democrats and relentlessly worked the phones.</p>
        <p>The doggedness has paid off. Mr. McBride has raised substantially more money than Ms. Reno, picked up support from unions and won endorsements from most of the major state newspapers' editorial boards.</p>
        <p>He has raised $2.8 million to Ms. Reno's $1.6 million, according to reports filed last month with the state. Governor Bush has raised more than both of the Democratic contenders combined, pulling in $5.9 million.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Reno has managed to keep people talking about her campaign while spending very little money to do so. Playing off a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, she held a ''house party'' fund-raiser at a trendy South Beach nightclub in July that drew about 2,000 people and news organizations from several countries.</p>
        <p>People everywhere stop to take pictures beside the pickup truck she has been driving around the state. Rosie O'Donnell and Martin Sheen have campaigned on her behalf.</p>
        <p>Yet while Mr. McBride, who served in the Marines in Vietnam, may lack star appeal and has yet to be seen on a dance floor, he has begun spending money on advertising to increase his name recognition. Some say he has even had unintended help from the Republicans.</p>
        <p>The Florida Republican Party began running television commercials weeks ago depicting Mr. McBride as a greedy corporate lawyer. The Bush campaign has accused Mr. McBride, the former managing partner of Holland &amp; Knight in Tampa, of enriching the firm's partners at the expense of rank-and-file employees.</p>
        <p>''The negative ads that the Republicans ran against McBride may have backfired because they have raised his visibility,'' said Lance de Haven-Smith, political science professor at Florida State University.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. McBride says the focus on him indicates nervousness in the Bush camp.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole series of 30-second half-truths that will all be resolved, after the general election, if I get the nomination,'' Mr. McBride said of the Republicans' advertisements. ''Jeb Bush can't win by running negative -- people are tired of it.''</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Reno, Mr. McBride does not have an unkind thing to say about her.</p>
        <p>The candidates offer similar platforms that center on improving education, providing prescription drug benefits for the elderly and protecting the environment. Mr. McBride and Ms. Reno seem to be virtually ignoring each other while keeping their sights on Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Bush backers profess not to be worried. ''We are sitting with a very popular governor who's well organized and has all the resources he needs on hand for an aggressive campaign,'' said Al Cardenas, head of the state Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, but Mr. McBride, a former star high school fullback, said after one campaign stop that candidates should not take victory for granted.</p>
        <p>''During the middle of a game,'' he said, ''you don't look up at the scoreboard very much.''</p>
