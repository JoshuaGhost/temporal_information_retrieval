        <p>Pet owners now have a reason besides a sick animal to turn to Dr. Michael Henes, a Croton-on-Hudson resident and veterinarian. Dr. Henes has begun Michael G. Henes, D.V.M., Pet Photography, where he combines his love of animals with his passion for photography. He photographs his subjects at their homes, which he said is ''essential for their comfort and ease.'' He photographs pets with or without their owners.</p>
        <p>A practicing veterinarian for 34 years, Dr. Henes founded the Croton Animal Hospital in 1973, where, after selling it in 2000, he continues to see patients part time. Dr. Henes said that any photo shoot can also involve ''a professional informal medical or surgical consult.'' Rates are $150 to $350 a session.</p>
