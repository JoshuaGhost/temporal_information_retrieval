        <p>STACY MORRISON does not take furniture lightly. ''You have to commit to it,'' said Ms. Morrison, who bought her first grown-up piece, an overstuffed sofa bed with a skirt and deep cushions, nine years ago. ''I have crazy sentimental feelings,'' she added.</p>
        <p>When the sofa bed's original ivory-on-beige damask slipcover grew tattered and its cushions grew mushy, she tried to buttress them with throw pillows. But deep down she knew she needed to take more drastic action: ''It was not chic, just shabby,'' she recalled. ''A flat pancake of a sofa.''</p>
        <p>Instead of replacing it, Ms. Morrison -- who overhauled Modern Bride magazine when she became its editor in 1997 -- opted for a thorough makeover.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Morrison bought the sofa in 1993, she had just moved into a 450-square-foot apartment in the West Village with her husband-to-be, Chris Shannon. Their other possessions were college holdovers or made of plastic. Ms. Morrison (now executive editor of Marie Claire magazine and, like her husband, 33) had the romantic notion, as she put it, of finding a sofa big enough for a couple who liked to stretch out in front of ''Melrose Place.''</p>
        <p>Their budget was as small as their living space, but they fell for a 96-inch-wide ''monster,'' as Ms. Morrison calls it, from Jennifer Convertibles. ''It was beige and masculine, but girly because it was squishy and soft and comfortable,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It cost $2,200, a lot for them, and when the monster got stuck in their narrow doorway, it took an emergency crew and another $200 to dismantle the thing and reassemble it.</p>
        <p>After seeing its innards, she said, ''I realized that it was a serious piece of furniture. And it launched a fanatic obsession.''</p>
        <p>Since then the couple have moved three times. When they took off for San Francisco at one point, the movers asked for a disclaimer acknowledging that the sofa bed might not survive the trip.</p>
        <p>When the couple moved back to New York, they put some of their greatest acquisitions in storage, including a Minotti bookcase and an Italian chaise longue. They shipped back two Arne Jacobsen chairs -- and the road-weary sofa bed.</p>
        <p>Now living in a rental apartment in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn, Ms. Morrison has devoted her impulses to transforming the overstuffed 1993 couch into a sleek 21st-century contender, aiming to bring out the sofa bed's bones by cloaking them in a toile-like chinoiserie fabric.</p>
        <p>After scouting the Internet for upholsterers in Cobble Hill, Ms. Morrison finally found one while strolling around Brooklyn: Gerard Theuns Upholstery at 89 Atlantic Avenue. In the window was a settee upholstered in multicolored Scalamandre silk, her dream fabric. Inside the store she found Mr. Theuns, a thin, muscular man in his 50's who says sentimental customers like Ms. Morrison walk in all the time. ''People like holding on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His first recommendation was to send the pillows to a specialist. Meanwhile the monster required at least a dozen yards of fabric. At $300 or more a yard, Ms. Morrison said, the Scalamandre offered ''a level of connoisseurship I totally can't afford.'' So she set out on a hunt that lasted longer than the one for the sofa.</p>
        <p>She spotted silk chinoiseries at $75 a yard in one New York store, but they didn't seem very sturdy. Frustrated, she wound up back at Mr. Theuns's sample books, narrowing her choice to a Stroheim &amp; Romann damask called Canton with pagodas and fruit baskets at 27-inch intervals.</p>
        <p>The choice was soon narrowed to salmon with gold highlights, or merlot, a deep red on red.</p>
        <p>When she tentatively asked Mr. Shannon if he wouldn't mind going with the merlot, she was surprised to hear him say yes.</p>
        <p>Once that decision was made, the work went quickly. Mr. Theuns stripped the sofa bed to its wooden frame, and then he built it back up with medium-density foam and stitched Dacron. ''It was a simple job, very straightforward,'' he said. ''What made it interesting was the fabric.'' Because its pattern is repeated at unusually wide intervals, it was a challenge to get it to fall just right, and it also required extra amounts: 14 yards all told. At $95 a yard, that meant a total of $1,330 -- plus $1,200 for Mr. Theuns's labor.</p>
        <p>When the sofa came home, gone was the blousy slipcover look; the taut red fabric was welted, giving it a more modern and masculine appearance; the skirt was gone, too, baring legs that are tapered and dark brown.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morrison broadcast its arrival like a parent announcing a birth. She said she plans to give the new sofa ''a proper debut'' with a party this fall.</p>
        <p>The bottom line? Including restuffed cushions ($700) and fabric samples ($200), the renovation cost $3,430. ''A lot of my friends were like, 'Geez, that's a lot of money,' '' Ms. Morrison conceded. ''I could have bought a good sofa for $3,000, but did you see the hard time I had just choosing the fabric? If I had to pick a new sofa, it would take forever.''</p>
        <p>It turns out that she is still thinking about that salmon fabric. She may use a yard of it -- or perhaps even a yard of the Scalamandre -- to cover the throw pillows. And when pressed, she admits seeing little flaws, like a glimpse of the mattress formerly hidden by the bed skirt.</p>
        <p>But she remains philosophical. ''The couch isn't going to look like this forever,'' she said, ''because I'm going to redo it again someday.''</p>
