        <p>Near rows of memorial candles lighted by Israelis outside the American Embassy in Tel Aviv tonight, someone held up a homemade sign that read, ''U.S.A. and Israel, Together We Fight Terrorism.''</p>
        <p>The sense of shared struggle echoed in both public and private displays of sympathy here on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The year has been one of relentless terrorism in Israel, and for many people the themes of remembrance and resolve in America had a resonance.</p>
        <p>''It's a sad day, but we have enough sad days of our own,'' one woman told an Israeli television interviewer on the street.</p>
        <p>Another woman said she could readily identify with grieving Americans ''after everything we've been through.''</p>
        <p>At an official memorial ceremony, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon asserted that Israel and the United States faced a common enemy.</p>
        <p>''One year after Sept. 11,'' Mr. Sharon said, ''the free world is gradually reaching the recognition that there is no such thing as good and bad terror, nor does terror have geographic borders.</p>
        <p>''Bin Laden's suicide terrorism, the terrorism of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Tanzim and Hezbollah, the terrorism operated by the Palestinian Authority, the involvement and support of Saddam Hussein in Palestinian terrorism or the terrorist networks operated by Iran -- all are an inseparable part of that axis of evil which threatens peace and stability worldwide.''</p>
        <p>Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, chief of staff of the Israeli Army, said the attacks on Sept. 11 had only ''deepened the feeling of a fate shared by the United States and Israel,'' a sense that ''we are on the front line of the world's fight against terror.''</p>
        <p>There were also personal acts of sympathy. Natalia Paruz, an Israeli musician, put a small stone from the depths of ground zero in a crack of the Western Wall in Jerusalem, like the notes bearing prayers tucked among the wall's crevices.</p>
        <p>The stone had been given to her by the Rev. Lawrence Recla, pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in Long Island City, Queens. He had served at ground zero, and got to know Ms. Paruz, who lives part of the year in Long Island City, when she performed at his church.</p>
        <p>This month he asked that she place the stone in the wall, a shrine near the site of the ancient Jewish temples.</p>
        <p>''The stone,'' Ms. Paruz said, ''is a prayer for the people who were killed.''</p>
