        <p>Graham Spurrier gathered the Babe Ruth team that he coached and posed a question to the teenage boys: ''How many of you believe that it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game, that counts?''</p>
        <p>A number of the players raised their hands. They were small-town boys from Johnson City, Tenn., and they had been taught the same aphorism about sportsmanship that kids everywhere had been taught.</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't believe in that saying,'' Spurrier told the kids. ''We're going to play to win.''</p>
        <p>His best player was his son, Steve, who was 13 or 14 at the time and accustomed to taking his father's word as gospel. This is what a son does when his dad is a Presbyterian minister. If anyone ever played to win, and hated to lose, it was Steve Spurrier. He would lead his high school team to two state titles in baseball, not losing a single game as a pitcher. He won the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at the University of Florida, then coached his alma mater to a national championship in 1996, averaging 10 victories a season during his 12 years there.</p>
        <p>''If they're keeping score, you're supposed to try to win,'' Graham Spurrier told his son, who learned well.</p>
        <p>And now Steve Spurrier has brought his radical passing offense, which he calls the Fun 'n' Gun, to the National Football League as coach of the Washington Redskins. Perhaps not since Buddy Ryan brought the rampaging ''46'' defense to the league has there been such a polarizing, audacious threat to the N.F.L.'s generally cautious, risk-averse way of doing business.</p>
        <p>While Spurrier's aw-shucks personality is not as brazen as Ryan's, he possesses the same bluntness and self-assuredness that some perceive as arrogance. And there is a relentlessness to the way he coaches. As long as the clock is running, his team will be passing. This infuriated San Francisco Coach Steve Mariucci in the preseason opener, when Spurrier called for a pass on fourth-and-1 and rang up another touchdown in a game that was already decided. But Spurrier never apologized at Florida, and he will not start now.</p>
        <p>''Tiger Woods doesn't start hitting it into the woods and the water to be fair,'' said Jamie Speronis, the Redskins' director of football operations.</p>
        <p>For some, Spurrier's presence will be the equivalent of opening a window on a musty league that can be as brutal in its dullness and sameness as in its violence. It is a league whose system of parity is, in essence, planned mediocrity, a league that prefers imitation to innovation. As many as 22 teams last season employed some version of the West Coast offense, which relies on short passes to backs and receivers and long runs made after the catch.</p>
        <p>''This is a league where a lot of coaches do things, basically because that's the way they've always been done,'' said John Guy, the director of pro personnel for the Buffalo Bills, who formerly coached with Spurrier at Duke. ''It's a copycat system. Steve is not a traditional guy. There isn't a need for change in the league, but there is a need for freshness.''</p>
        <p>While Spurrier might seem a revolutionary figure, he is a throwback to the heyday of another N.F.L. maverick, Al Davis, who also preferred long passes and thrilled at risk with the Oakland Raiders. The Fun 'n' Gun is designed to score touchdowns frequently and ostentatiously. This preseason, the Redskins became the first N.F.L. team to score 35 or more points in 4 games, before they were throttled, 28-14, by the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last Thursday.</p>
        <p>''We don't have all the answers and don't pretend to,'' Spurrier said. But, he added: ''I've always believed that if you play a lot of close games, you're going to lose your share. Teams that kick a lot of field goals, they don't go real far, it seems like.''</p>
        <p>Instead of long, steady drives, the Fun 'n' Gun is made for the quick score. Where the West Coast offense may send a group of receivers 3 to 7 yards downfield, the Fun 'n' Gun places them 15 or 20 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The quarterback does not read through a progression of receivers, as is customary, but rather looks for an open space in the defense. The idea is to create a mismatch, to isolate a defender, to throw the ball to an empty zone or to flood more receivers into an area than there are backs to cover them.</p>
        <p>The system necessitates an astute reading of alignments by the quarterback and precise routes by the receivers. It also requires an offensive line that can protect a quarterback sufficiently to allow five- and seven-step dropbacks.</p>
        <p>At its most rudimentary, the system has its origins in sandlot football. If a guy plays you tight, throw over his head. If he backs off, throw in front of him. What will make Spurrier successful in the N.F.L. is the exacting way he teaches quarterbacks and receivers, not the exotic things he does, said Nick Saban, who faced Spurrier yearly as the coach at Louisiana State University and was formerly defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns.</p>
        <p>''They will do a lot of things to vertically stretch a defense,'' Saban said. ''There's going to be distance between deep and short defenders and they try to take advantage of that space. The more conscious you are about that, it makes you softer against runs, screens and draws. The thing people misunderstand about Steve is that when he's had the best running backs, he's had his best success.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Spurrier has Stephen Davis, the N.F.C.'s leading rusher last season. Still, there is as much skepticism as anticipation about Spurrier's system. The N.F.L. has long preached that championships are won with defense and running games. Spurrier's contrarian belief has been validated by the recent air-delivered success of Coach Mike Martz and the St. Louis Rams. And he might also be aided by advantageous rules. In the N.F.L., defensive backs cannot touch receivers more than 5 yards from the ball, and pass-interference penalties are marked at the spot of the foul, compared with 10-yard assessments in college.</p>
        <p>''Everyone said: 'He's not going to do anything at Florida. You've got to run the ball and play defense in the S.E.C.,' '' Spurrier said. ''A lot of people say that about the N.F.L. You do have to play superior defense, but Mike Martz has proven there's other ways to win on offense.''</p>
        <p>While some might find Spurrier arrogant and petulant -- he will toss a visor or slam a clipboard if the offense is not run to his demanding standards -- there is also an endearingly casual and boyish way that he approaches football at age 57. It evokes a time when passes were drawn in the dirt after school or during recess. He is being paid $5 million a year to coach a team in the nation's capital, where football is every bit the bloodsport that politics is, yet he refers to himself as a ''ball coach'' who draws up ''ball plays'' and likes his quarterbacks to ''pitch it around.''</p>
        <p>In a league where a Ph.D. in linguistics is seemingly needed to call a play, Spurrier prefers a simpler terminology. On one particular formation, the receiver is instructed to line up ''fairly close'' to another receiver. Asked by a player what ''fairly close'' meant, Spurrier replied, ''Well, it's between close and regular.''</p>
        <p>''He's different in a league that doesn't like different people,'' Steve Spurrier Jr., who coaches the Redskins receivers, said of his father. ''He is a guy who doesn't talk about working long hours, doesn't talk about big, thick playbooks, doesn't talk about organization and management and statistical breakdowns. He just does what he does. People don't like that, because if it works, shoot, what are they going to do?''</p>
        <p>But will it work? Spurrier has imported two of his former Florida quarterbacks to operate the Fun 'n' Gun, neither of them with a distinguished professional career. Danny Wuerffel, the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner, has started six games in five transient N.F.L. seasons, while Shane Matthews has made but 15 starts in eight seasons. Other questions abound. Can a team dependent on the pass survive the cold, windy days of November and December in the N.F.C. East? Can Washington build a cohesive system in a league where free agency means revolving-door personnel? Can a mediocre offensive line protect the quarterbacks to allow them to throw deep?</p>
        <p>Wuerffel was sacked five times and fumbled three times against the Patriots on Thursday, losing the starting job to Matthews. Despite a 4-1 exhibition record, the Redskins failed to score a single point against the starters of the Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers, the American Football Conference's top teams last season.</p>
        <p>''I think it can work,'' said an A.F.C. scout who attended last Thursday's exhibition and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''But it leaves the quarterback exposed. As defensive linemen get faster and faster, that becomes harder to justify and harder to risk.''</p>
        <p>Said an N.F.C. scout whose team will play the Redskins this season: ''He never gives up. They throw and throw. You can't think you have him down, because he'll hammer until the final gun. He's the kind of guy you love if he's on your team and hate if he's on the other team, like Deion Sanders. But you've got to respect a guy who wants to win. I think they can win at least nine games.''</p>
        <p>And no one is more serious about winning than Spurrier. During his Heisman Trophy season at Florida, he got married one morning and was back at practice that afternoon. Those who have coached with him speak of his competitiveness in bowling, pool, even jogging. Steve Jr. and Steve Sr. once played weekly one-on-one basketball games, that is, until the younger Spurrier finally won. They never played again.</p>
        <p>The only place Steve Sr. has underachieved has been the N.F.L., where he played for 10 seasons, mostly as a backup. He did start for Tampa Bay during its inglorious 0-14 season of 1976, but even that uninterrupted defeat has become a badge of accomplishment. On the dinner circuit, Spurrier for years has portrayed himself as quarterback of the losingest team in N.F.L. history.</p>
        <p>''Last year, when Detroit got close to his record, he didn't want them to get it,'' Steve Jr. said. ''He said, 'We gotta hold onto that one. We're in the books for that one.' ''</p>
