        <p>New Jersey Department of Education reports state's high school seniors' scores on college entrance exams were nearly identical to 2001, putting state in bottom 20 of rankings on verbal and mathematics scores; notes, however, that 82 percent of seniors took test, compared with national average of 46 percent (S)</p>

        <p>New Jersey high school seniors' scores on college entrance tests remained nearly identical to scores from last year, putting New Jersey in the bottom of the rankings on verbal and mathematics skills. New Jersey seniors scored an average of 498 on the verbal test, down one point from last year and below the 504 national average. Mathematics scores averaged 513, the same as last year and below the 516 national average. New Jersey students rank in the bottom 20 among states on both tests. However, New Jersey is second only to Connecticut in the number of students who take the test. Having more test-takers frequently brings down the average scores, according to the state Department of Education, which announced the results last week. In New Jersey, 82 percent of seniors took the test, compared to a national average of 46 percent.</p>
