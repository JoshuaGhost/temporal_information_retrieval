        <p>JOHN COLTON. St. John Hankin. Gertrude Tonkonogy. If these names look familiar, you're either a drama professor or a trivia buff. Or the artistic director of one of three nonprofit Off Broadway companies that make it their business to exhume the dust-covered works of forgotten, or nearly forgotten, playwrights.</p>
        <p>Curious about Susan Glaspell's now obscure 1931 Pulitzer Prize-winner, ''Alison's House''? The Mint Theater Company in Midtown Manhattan performed it in 1999. Eager to see a production of ''The Silver Cord,'' Sidney Howard's 1926 potboiler about a smothering mother? The Peccadillo Theater Company, which operates out of the Bank Street Theater in Greenwich Village, did it in 1995. Searching for a revival of John van Druten's tender World War II romance, ''The Voice of the Turtle''? The itinerant Keen Company to the rescue. In fact, after the Keen version of the 1943 play was well received last September, the Mint took it over for an extended run.</p>
        <p>''We're cousin companies obviously on some level,'' said Carl Forsman, 31, who founded the Keen two years ago and directed ''The Voice of the Turtle.'' Mr. Forsman began reading old plays in his former job as literary manager for another Off Broadway troupe, now defunct, the Blue Light Theater Company. He said he had urged its members to consider ''The Voice of the Turtle'' for a production, but ''they said I was being na√Øve and that the play was too simple-minded for New York audiences.''</p>
        <p>This is the kind of talk that Mr. Forsman and his colleagues -- Jonathan Bank, 42, of the Mint and Dan Wackerman, 45, of Peccadillo -- wish they didn't hear as much as they do. It hasn't stopped them, though. All three will be presenting their latest rediscoveries this fall.</p>
        <p>''Traditionally, theater has been a place for great hope and celebration for our culture and society,'' Mr. Forsman said, ''particularly in the first half of the last century.'' Today, though, he added, older plays by writers who have fallen into obscurity or were never well known must wage a fight they didn't have to take on in their day: ''the battle for sophistication.''</p>
        <p>''There's a widespread notion that to be sophisticated now you have to be a cynic,'' Mr. Forsman said. ''That existentialism as a pose is more complicated than optimism. These plays, which are sophisticated -- they're literate, intelligent and emotionally complicated -- they say that sophisticated people have feelings and can be generous. There aren't too many plays like that being written today.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there will always be critics and theatergoers who consider vintage plays dated (dreaded term).</p>
        <p>''That's such a weasel word,'' said Mr. Wackerman with a wry smile. ''What isn't dated? What could be more dated that Chekhov's landed aristocracy on the razor's edge? In what way does that speak to contemporary audiences? And yet, it clearly does.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wackerman explained what he looks for: ''The play that's never been produced, never been revived, or is just not done very much at all, especially in New York.'' The description could fit the forthcoming shows of each company.</p>
        <p>The Mint, at 10 years old and the best known of the three, will produce ''The Charity That Began at Home,'' a 1906 play by the British writer St. John Hankin, a seldom-produced Edwardian-era figure. Peccadillo will stage a melodrama by John Colton, ''The Shanghai Gesture,'' which is set in a brothel and caused a sensation on Broadway in 1926. Keen will present ''Three-Cornered Moon,'' a screwball comedy from 1933 and Gertrude Tonkonogy's major theater credit.</p>
        <p>''I have no interest in doing museum pieces or curiosities,'' said Mr. Bank, of the Mint. ''I'm interested in plays that move me when I read them.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, he writes in the introduction to the recently published ''Worthy but Neglected: Plays of the Mint Theater Company'' (Granville Press): ''A library card is the primary tool of my trade, not an advanced degree in archaeology. The trick is, I'm willing to read a play even though I've never heard of it.'' The book, edited by Mr. Bank, includes the texts of seven plays the Mint has presented.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bank grew up in Cleveland, wanting to become a professional storyteller. After shepherding other people's stories -- that is, directing -- and getting a graduate degree in acting from Case Western Reserve, he moved to New York. A Case classmate, Kelly Morgan, invited him to join the Mint. When Mr. Morgan, who was the company's artistic director, returned to academia, Mr. Bank took over and decided to emphasize ''worthy but neglected'' plays. The Mint has introduced contemporary theatergoers to, among other works, ''Mr. Pim Passes By,'' a breezy 1920 comedy by A. A. Milne, and ''The Voysey Inheritance,'' a 1905 morality tale about money and greed by Harley Granville-Barker. The company, which operates on an annual budget of about $350,000, has been described by the critic Michael Feingold in The Village Voice as a ''truffle hound of half-buried treasures from the past.'' It won an Obie grant in 2001 and a special Drama Desk award last spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bank was using his library card when he first read ''The Charity That Began at Home,'' Hankin's comedy about the perils of misapplied philanthropy. The production, directed by Gus Kaikkonen, begins performances at the Mint on Sept. 27. Hankin counted Granville-Barker and Shaw among his fans, but success was elusive. In 1909, when he was 39 and in failing health, Hankin tied two dumbbells around his neck and drowned himself in a river in Wales. ''I think he was way ahead of his time,'' Mr. Bank said. ''His voice was too wry and cynical.''</p>
        <p>UNLIKE the Mint, Peccadillo concentrates only on American plays. In past seasons, the company has resurrected S. J. Perelman's satire of American culture ''The Beauty Part'' and Philip Barry's early metaphysical drama ''In a Garden.'' Mr. Wackerman, who founded Peccadillo in 1994 and directs each production, is from Rochester, and studied playwriting at Catholic University in Washington. The company's annual operating budget is about $80,000.</p>
        <p>Peccadillo's first work this season, ''The Shanghai Gesture,'' will be a co-production with the 10-year-old Yangtze Repertory Theater of America. Mr. Wackerman said he thought the company would be an apt artistic partner, with its roots in the Asian community. The play, which begins performances on Oct. 24 at the Bank Street Theater, describes the elaborate revenge of Mother Goddam, the diabolical madam of the most notorious brothel in China. Mr. Wackerman's uncut version will include passages deemed too scandalous in 1926.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is appreciative of such artistic excavations. While Peccadillo was commended for initiating rare renditions of the novelist Dawn Powell's 1934 social satire ''Jig Saw'' and John O'Hara's 1950's drama ''Veronique,'' critics raised questions about the merits of the scripts and faulted the productions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wackerman said he stood by the choice to stage both plays, which, he acknowledged, are flawed works. ''The masterpiece approach to criticism is counterproductive,'' he argued. ''There are very few American plays of the first rank. You can't keep doing 'Streetcar' and 'Our Town' and 'Long Day's Journey.' A literate, cultured theater audience wants more than that.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Forsman of the Keen, ''If there isn't some aspect that resonates with an audience today, I won't do it.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of contemporary writing is very cynical about humanity,'' he continued, ''very pessimistic about the state of the world. They're not very reflective of my experience and the world I grew up in.''</p>
        <p>The son of a Methodist minister in New Jersey and a high school teacher, Mr. Forsman said his parents subscribed to the ''everything will work out'' philosophy. ''My dad would forget to pay taxes for a year and then someone would come along and help him. It was just like in 'You Can't Take It With You.' For me, that's a play about my family in 1979. 'Three-Cornered Moon' also smells like my family.''</p>
        <p>''Three-Cornered Moon,'' about an eccentric Brooklyn family that finds renewed purpose when it loses a fortune in the stock market, was the first play written by Gertrude Tonkonogy, a 24-year-old Brooklyn secretary. She is said to have completed it in less than three weeks after inspiration visited her in the bathtub. Ruth Gordon starred in the Broadway production. The revival begins performances on Friday at the Blue Heron Arts Center.</p>
        <p>The unusual mission of the Keen, which has a budget of $100,000, is to produce not lost works but ''sincere plays,'' Mr. Forsman said. That allows it enough room to dabble occasionally in contemporary material. Last year, the company presented the American premiere of a one-man play by the widely admired Irish playwright Conor McPherson, ''The Good Thief,'' which starred Brian d'Arcy James and was directed by Mr. Forsman.</p>
        <p>The search, meanwhile, for next season's buried treasures continues. Mr. Bank, of the Mint, doesn't have to make as many trips to the library as he once did. These days, he is inundated with suggestions. ''People say to me, 'Why don't you do such and such a play?' I say: 'That was done 20 years ago.' 'That's in print.' 'That's in an anthology. 'It's still being taught in school or read.' 'That play doesn't need the Mint.' ''</p>
        <p>Three-Cornered Moon  Keen Company, Blue Heron  Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street.  Previews begin Friday; opens next Sunday; through Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>The Charity That Began At Home  Mint Theater Company, 311 West 43rd Street.  Previews begin Sept. 27; opens Oct. 7; through Oct. 27.</p>
        <p>The Shanghai Gesture  Peccadillo Theater Company, Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street.  Previews begin Oct. 24; opening date to be announced; through Nov. 17.</p>
