        <p>Tally of dead from Sept 11 terrorist attacks stands at 3,025 people, making that day second bloodiest day in United States history; Civil War battle of Antietam maintains first place; there are still 35 to 40 people on list of Sept 11 missing whose names might be removed from final count (M)</p>

        <p>IN the first chaotic weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, the list of missing and presumed dead soared to nearly 7,000. A year has passed, the rubble has been dug out, and what human remains could be found, have been meticulously collected. In that time, the count has been cut more than in half, offering a strange if unsatisfying sense of relief for a scarred nation.</p>
        <p>As the tally now stands, 3,025 people were killed on Sept. 11, or in the weeks that followed, as a result of the terrorist attacks. That list, excluding the 19 hijackers, consists of 2,801 killed or still missing from the World Trade Center, 184 killed at the Pentagon and 40 killed on Flight 93, which crashed near Shanksville, Pa. That combined loss of life will still record that day as the second bloodiest day in United States history, with the Civil War battle of Antietam maintaining the miserable honor of first place.</p>

        <p>IN the first chaotic weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, the list of missing and presumed dead soared to nearly 7,000. A year has passed, the rubble has been dug out, and what human remains could be found, have been meticulously collected. In that time, the count has been cut more than in half, offering a strange if unsatisfying sense of relief for a scarred nation.</p>
        <p>As the tally now stands, 3,025 people were killed on Sept. 11, or in the weeks that followed, as a result of the terrorist attacks. That list, excluding the 19 hijackers, consists of 2,801 killed or still missing from the World Trade Center, 184 killed at the Pentagon and 40 killed on Flight 93, which crashed near Shanksville, Pa. That combined loss of life will still record that day as the second bloodiest day in United States history, with the Civil War battle of Antietam maintaining the miserable honor of first place.</p>
        <p>Accounting for the dead moved swiftly in Washington and Pennsylvania, with final numbers settled in Pennsylvania by Sept. 12 and in Washington within two weeks. But in New York, a year after the attack, the culling of the list is still not complete.</p>
        <p>The scale of the calamity certainly complicated the task. Thousands of people who had initially been reported as missing turned out to alive. Others were counted twice or even three times in the original tally. And several dozen people fraudulently tried to add names to the list, hoping to grab a piece of the millions in relief money. Week by week, month by month, the count dropped, and New York City officials now say they are confident they are nearly at a final number.</p>
        <p>Of the World Trade Center total, 1,399 victims, or just about half, have been positively identified as a result of remains recovered from ground zero. Death certificates for another 1,335 have been issued after their families asked the courts to definitively confirm that the victims were at the trade center at the time of attack and have not been seen since.</p>
        <p>That leaves 67 who are still listed as missing and for whom death certificates have not been issued. The medical examiner's office intends to continue trying to identify the dead through at least early next year, relying on advanced DNA techniques. That could whittle down the list of the 67 missing and move more victims from the category of court-confirmed dead to positively identified.</p>
        <p>But there are still 35 to 40 people on the list of the missing whose names might be removed from the final count altogether. The city, as well as news organizations including The New York Times and The Associated Press, do not have definitive evidence that these people died in the attacks.</p>
        <p>That means some small number of those whose names are read at the ceremony in New York today -- and are listed above -- may not have been killed in the attack. City officials said that just as they did not have enough information to confirm these deaths, they did not have sufficient information to prove that these people were not killed. So it will still be some time before the final number -- sure to be somewhere around 3,000 -- is ready to be entered into the history books.</p>
