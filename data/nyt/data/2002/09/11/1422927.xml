        <p>SIMON-Michael J. One year ago today we lost Michael J. Simon, a Cantor-Fitzgerald employee, North Tower, Floor 105. Michael was proud to work in that soaring edifice that exemplified the American and world capitalist financial system. Like those ramrods straight towers soaring into the heavens, Michael's morality and character was a beacon of light in this difficult world. Michael, you can be proud of your wife. You can rest easy with the assurance that your children are handling life well, partly due to the years of love and example you were able to give them. We miss you terribly. We thought we had time with you, Michael. We will honor you all the days of our lives. Barbara and Jim Romaine</p>
