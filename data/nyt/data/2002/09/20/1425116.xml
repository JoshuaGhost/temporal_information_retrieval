        <p>Republican leaders in the House have decided against pushing for a new round of tax cuts to help investors, effectively killing for this year a proposal floated last month by President Bush, Congressional aides said today.</p>
        <p>Judging that there is not enough time or political support to pass additional tax cuts before Congress goes home to campaign next month, Republican leaders have decided to shelve the idea for now and revisit it next year, the aides said.</p>
        <p>The decision appeared to have been made in consultation with the White House, which had signaled in recent days that Mr. Bush was no longer intent on following through on the proposal. Mr. Bush said last month that he was developing plans to address the weak stock market and help investors through measures that might include cutting taxes on dividends, increasing the deductibility of capital losses and allowing workers to contribute more money to their 401(k) retirement plans.</p>
        <p>From the start, both the administration and Republican leaders in Congress had acknowledged that there was little chance of the proposals getting through the Democratic-controlled Senate and being signed into law this year. But they had seen the plan as an opportunity to address concern about the markets and the economy heading into Election Day and to keep Democrats on the defensive over tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The danger for Congressional Republicans now is that they are leaving the playing field on economic policy open for Democrats. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, plans to push hard for the Senate to pass legislation in coming weeks to address 401(k) plans. In an interview last week, Mr. Daschle said he was considering pushing several other initiatives, including an increase in the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Senate Democrats are still working on their legislation, which would give workers more latitude to diversify their 401(k) plan holdings out of company stock and limit the ability of executives to sell company stock during periods in which workers cannot. But the provisions fall short of what consumer advocates have been seeking.</p>
        <p>Democrats are hopeful that the debate over the bill will give them an opportunity to focus public attention on the weak economy, the fall in the stock market and the corporate scandals of the last year, all of which they are counting on to help them on Election Day.</p>
        <p>So far, Democrats have had little success shifting the focus back to the economy from the possibility of war with Iraq. But some Republicans said their party would be making a mistake to drop the issue of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, is continuing to press for consideration of a smaller package of tax cuts than the ones the White House had been studying. Mr. DeLay has been backing a proposal that would include a small increase in the deductibility of capital losses and allow retiring workers to delay cashing in their 401(k)'s if the market is depressed when they leave the work force. His plan also includes a provision to expand the government's ability to seek the return of ill-gotten gains from corporate executives and return them to shareholders.</p>
        <p>But Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has been skeptical about the chances of getting any tax legislation enacted so close to Election Day.</p>
        <p>The White House and some Republicans in Congress have also been concerned that pushing for any tax cut would leave their party exposed to criticism from Democrats of further increasing the federal budget deficit and favoring wealthy investors over lower-income people.</p>
        <p>Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, said on Wednesday that Mr. Bush had been trying to develop a plan that would be economically effective, politically feasible and fiscally responsible, but had not yet found one.</p>
