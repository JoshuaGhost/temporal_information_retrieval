        <p>THE first sign that something was going on was when Cowboys &amp; Indians magazine materialized on my parents' coffee table. They began traveling to cowboy poetry readings; Clint Black quietly replaced Barbra Streisand in the CD player. Finally, my parents confessed: they had bought property in Montana and were planning to build a log cabin in the wilderness.</p>
        <p>I hadn't had a clue that my parents -- otherwise rational Silicon Valley suburbanites -- were interested in the Old West. But as it turns out, a fascination with homesteading and the cowboy culture is sweeping a certain demographic of middle-age professionals from the Coasts. Silicon Valley residents in their mid-50's, my parents and their friends are building vacation homes; but instead of replicating the comforts of home, they have veered toward rustic ranches and quaint log cabins in Wyoming and Montana, Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Blame cowboy nostalgia, the seeds of which were planted during the Western-loving 1950's; or perhaps the fascination stems from sheer exhaustion from living in the high-tech bustle.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best indicator of this interest in second homes in the Old West has been the exponential growth of Cowboys &amp; Indians, essential reading for any weekend warrior Westerner. The editor in chief, Eric O'Keefe, describes his magazine as ''quite aspirational'' and ''the Town &amp; Country of the American West.'' Its demographics tend to be affluent and older, with almost half the readership living on the West or East Coast. Inside the magazine, articles about cowboy bars and Indian photography share space with ads for $5 million rustic lodges and fox-fur throw blankets.</p>
        <p>His coastal readers, Mr. O'Keefe said, are being drawn back to the icons of their youth. ''There were more Western movies made between 1902 to the late 1960's than any other genre; you look at that viewership and who are they?'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''People who are 50 and 60 now. Their education and work experiences have been taken care of, and they are looking towards something new.''</p>
        <p>He could easily be describing my parents, who wax rhapsodic about the visions of the Old West they grew up with but never knew firsthand. My mother reminisces about TV shows like ''My Friend Flicka'' and ''The Roy Rogers Show''; my father loved ''Gunsmoke.''</p>
        <p>''Things were simpler then; there were the good guys and the bad guys, and the good guys always won,'' my father recalled. ''And there weren't any attorneys.''</p>
        <p>There also wasn't any wall-to-wall carpeting. In Silicon Valley, my parents' home is contemporary traditional -- floral wallpaper, granite kitchen counters, refurbished American antiques. Their recently completed second home, however, is cowboy rustic: a two-story log cabin made from recycled materials, complete with antler lamps and animal hides and cowboy hats, saddles and Indian artifacts hidden in nooks and crannies. A moosehead gazes beatifically from above the enormous stone fireplace in the great room, and guns and bear traps are decorative motifs -- never mind the fact that my parents would never, ever harm an animal, let alone shoot one.</p>
        <p>From the rocking chairs on the porch, with a view of the Bridger Mountains, you can watch horses graze and deer traipse by on the way to the creek. But even though the view hasn't changed much since Lewis and Clark marched across the land in 1804 (a fact that my parents love to point out), the lifestyle certainly has. My parents' home comes with heated floors; a home office with Internet access; a steam shower. My father notes that: ''We aren't doing the grunge part of the Western experience. We're getting the best of the culture, without the worst of the culture. We don't have to get our hands dirty.''</p>
        <p>They are, however, conscious of the contrast in their Western and Old West identities. ''We took the California license plate off the car. We try to blend in, not wear glitzy clothes. We always have a sense of humor about what we do,'' joked my mother. My parents may avoid looking like city slickers, but other weekenders are more ostentatious misfits. East of Bozeman, where my parents bought their land, property is still affordable; but in Big Sky, near Yellowstone, property values are skyrocketing, thanks to a huge influx of affluent vacationers, including celebrities, who apparently prefer Montana's lower-key ski areas over the ritz of places like Aspen.</p>
        <p>The picturesque mountains are dotted with enormous multimillion-dollar, 20,000-square-foot ''log cabin-style'' mansions. In the most affluent development, the Yellowstone Club, two to six acres cost $650,000 to $2.75 million, not including the house or the $250,000 membership fee.</p>
        <p>Greg LeMond, an American cyclist who won the Tour de France three times, was among the first to build a second home in the Yellowstone Club. Mr. LeMond, unlike more conspicuously consuming residents, however, built a six-building compound of rustic two-room log cabins on 25 acres with three man-made fishing lakes.</p>
        <p>The cabins are furnished in what is known as Cowboy High Style, with antique Molesworth furniture and moose-antler chairs, Indian drums and blankets. In the name of Western authenticity, one log cabin and a barn were rebuilt from the remains of abandoned buildings found on Ted Turner's 113,600-acre ranch, just north of Big Sky. Another bulding replicates a forest-service fire tower.</p>
        <p>Mr. LeMond acknowledges that, as were my parents, he was wooed by the Western imagery from his childhood in Los Angeles and Lake Tahoe in the 1960's. ''I was a wannabe cowboy, but I always wanted to be the Indian,'' he said. Now living in a 12,000-square-foot Georgian town house in Minneapolis, for his second home he had visions of getting back to nature with a rustic lodge like the ones he had seen on vacations in Yellowstone Park. ''Why duplicate my house in Minneapolis in Montana?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>When it comes to designing and decorating their second homes, many of these vacationers rush first to antler-horn chandeliers, quilts stitched with grizzled cowboys and paintings of stoic Indians. In Bozeman and Jackson Hole, Wyo., the streets are lined with interior design stores and galleries filled with Old West antiques and art at premium prices.</p>
        <p>Some locals, though, wince at the adoption of Old West clichés. Larry Pearson, a Bozeman architect, who built Mr. LeMond's second home as well as my parents', said he often had to direct his clients away from cowboys and Indians. ''The cowboy represents the icon of the West, but it's a stereotypical image,'' he said. ''In my houses, I try to go beneath that to what's even more fundamental in Montana: the agrarian culture, the lifestyle and values that the old ranchers were committed to.''</p>
        <p>Despite their infatuation with trappings like antler chandeliers, many suburban Old West enthusiasts do echo Mr. Pearson's love of these Western values. ''You spend much of your life in Silicon Valley where there are too many cars, too many people and a lot of people that are very impressed with themselves,'' explained Tom Brown, my parents' next-door neighbor, who is chairman of California Casualty Insurance. He recently built a 21st-century version of an early 1900's ranch house that overlooks a river in Wyoming. ''Then you come here,'' he said. ''The people are hard-working cattle ranchers, and if they are not calving they're branding, and if not branding they are haying, working night and day.''</p>
        <p>It was, perhaps, inevitable that the high-tech boom would initiate a longing for Old West living. And nationwide, the Western aesthetic is making a cultural comeback -- in fashion, via the rise of turquoise jewelry and denim work clothes; and in television, through popular reality shows like ''Frontier House.''</p>
        <p>But if weekend cowboys like my parents continue to flock to the lifestyle, this beloved simplicity is unlikely to remain uncorrupted forever. Mr. LeMond, already sounding like a concerned local, sighed. ''Montana is going to explode in recreational property,'' he said. ''It already has. Ten years ago, $1.5 million would have brought you 1,000 acres; now, it's 10 or 12 times that.''</p>
        <p>For the time being, however, a certain variety of authenticity is still possible. Despite the luxury of his homes, Mr. Pearson says that he is offering a whole new way of life -- the Montana experience -- to his out-of-town clients.</p>
        <p>It ''gives my clients a chance to pass on experience to their kids that might be deemed real,'' he said. ''Like, how it is to pack up a horse, cook over a campfire, go camping in the wilderness.''</p>
        <p>Granted, my parents haven't yet packed up a horse, and although on a recent family vacation they did roast s'mores over a campfire, their log cabin comes equipped with a contemporary range. Still, they recently learned how to harvest their hay and are avidly studying fly-fishing in hopes of catching their own dinners.</p>
        <p>As my father points out, ''We're not really cowhands, or really ranching, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy the experience.''</p>
