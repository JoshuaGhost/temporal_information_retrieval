        <p>Joss Whedon, who so breezily linked vampires with adolescent angst to create ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' has a new series billed as a ''sci-fi/western,'' and this time the wrenching together of genres is tortured. In its rough first episode on Fox tonight, ''Firefly'' is even more of a confusing mess than the description makes it sound. It's a crazy quilt of ''Star Wars,'' ''Mad Max'' and ''Stagecoach,'' just to mention the most obvious films it calls to mind.</p>
        <p>''Firefly'' takes place 500 years in the future on a ramshackle spaceship, ironically named Serenity and filled with renegades. After a universe-wide civil war, the world is now under the control of the dictatorial Alliance. The heroic losers who fought for independence are called the brown coats -- either counterintuitively, or because they are not what they seem, or because the Fascist brownshirts are meaningless in the 26th century. Who knows?</p>

        <p>Fox's "Firefly" gets off to a rough start but the show following it, "John Doe," is appealing, flowing easily from humor to drama.</p>

        <p>Joss Whedon, who so breezily linked vampires with adolescent angst to create ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' has a new series billed as a ''sci-fi/western,'' and this time the wrenching together of genres is tortured. In its rough first episode on Fox tonight, ''Firefly'' is even more of a confusing mess than the description makes it sound. It's a crazy quilt of ''Star Wars,'' ''Mad Max'' and ''Stagecoach,'' just to mention the most obvious films it calls to mind.</p>
        <p>''Firefly'' takes place 500 years in the future on a ramshackle spaceship, ironically named Serenity and filled with renegades. After a universe-wide civil war, the world is now under the control of the dictatorial Alliance. The heroic losers who fought for independence are called the brown coats -- either counterintuitively, or because they are not what they seem, or because the Fascist brownshirts are meaningless in the 26th century. Who knows?</p>
        <p>One of these rebels is the Serenity's captain, Mal Reynolds. A cynical mercenary on the surface (guess what his heart is made of), he is played stiffly by Nathan Fillion with a few redeeming flashes of wit.</p>
        <p>Other characters include a young doctor, Simon, and his fugitive sister, River, who is being sought by the Alliance because she is gifted in some yet unexplained but sure to be spooky way. Inara, a courtesan, is depicted as the most socially respectable character because prostitution is legal in the future and these so-called ''registered companions'' choose their own clients; the Alliance constitution is apparently based on ''Pretty Woman.'' The most recognizable actor is Ron Glass (from ''Barney Miller'') as a white-haired, ponytailed preacher called the Shepherd.</p>
        <p>Early in tonight's episode, Mal and his second in command, Zoe (Gina Torres), stop for a drink in a gloomy saloon with orange Chinese lanterns on a distant planet that looks like a mining town in the Old West. They have a gunfight on a dusty swath of ground outside the bar, only to escape when their spaceship drops by. This is as batty as the job they are hired to do, in an earnest and silly plot that lacks tension. They agree to rob boxes (owned by the evil Alliance) from a train, and we see the spaceship hovering over the train in special effects that look as if they were done by Toys ''R'' Us. When Mal discovers that he has been set up and has stolen medicine needed by poor miners, he follows his golden heart.</p>
        <p>Tonight's episode leaves a lot of plot holes for understandable reasons. The original two-hour pilot, which explains the future and how the crew got there, was put on the shelf because it was considered too slow to grab viewers. Fox plans to show it later in the season.</p>
        <p>Considering Mr. Whedon's wit and focus in other shows, there's still a possibility that ''Firefly'' might be fixed. The Serenity's crew hasn't even run into the Reavers yet, space cannibals whose handiwork is discovered next week. (The Reavers do not appear on screen.) And at the end of tonight's episode we glean that bad guys in suits are after River.</p>
        <p>Those suits say a lot about the show's confusion. Apparently fashion 500 years from now will include some costumes borrowed from ''Gladiator,'' others from Wall Street and gray uniforms worn by Alliance officers that seem left over from chauffeur characters in 1930's movies. You could argue that the villains dress like capitalists, but then why does one thuggish enforcer look as if he stepped out of ''Braveheart,'' complete with a half-painted face? All this makes as much or as little sense as the rest of ''Firefly.''</p>
        <p>To see why Mr. Whedon might be able to sort things out, though, take a look at the brisk, funny season premiere of ''Buffy'' (Tuesday on UPN). He wrote the episode, in which Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) takes her sister, Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), to her first day at Sunnydale High in a brand new building. They're so optimistic in Sunnydale. Don't they know you can't build a school over a Hellmouth without expecting a few undead to turn up in the ladies' room?</p>
        <p>''John Doe,'' arriving on Fox tonight after ''Firefly,'' is in many ways its opposite: lower profile and more entertaining than its description makes it sound. A naked man wakes on a wooded island near Seattle with no clue who he is, no memory of any past. But he does know every fact in the world: he can speak the Khmer language and can tell you how many M&amp;M's are in a package. (Sixty plain, only 25 peanut; can that be true?) Occasional glimpses from his point of view reveal that he sees in black and white.</p>
        <p>As forced as its concept seems, ''John Doe'' is alluring because it flows so easily from humor to drama then back again and because Dominic Purcell's smooth performance as John is perfectly in tune with that fluid style. John displays gleeful wonder at his own mental abilities, especially when he goes to the race track. He can't predict the future, but his computerlike brain is great at calculating odds. And he searches for his missing past without turning into the brooding hero.</p>
        <p>In addition to making him really good at ''Jeopardy,'' John's special gifts make him useful as a crime solver. Tonight he stops looking for himself long enough to help search for a kidnapped girl, whose photograph he eerily sees in color without understanding why.</p>
        <p>The first episode includes many teasing possibilities about his identity, delivered by John in too many voice-overs. ''So what am I?'' he asks himself. ''Escaped mental patient? Alien that sees in black and white? Government lobotomy experiment?'' Happily, the series is more earth-bound and humane.</p>
        <p>This first episode was directed by Mimi Leder (also one of the show's executive producers), who graduated from ''E.R.'' to films like ''Deep Impact.'' Her light touch makes ''John Doe'' so enticing and promising that tonight's cliffhanger ending works: John stands on a wharf and sees a ferry in the distance; a woman waves at him and yells ''Tommy'' as she is carried away.</p>
