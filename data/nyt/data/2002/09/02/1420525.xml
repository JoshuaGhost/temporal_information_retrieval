      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial hails Bush administration's apparent reversal that will allow use of some United States troops to stabilize areas of Afghanistan outside Kabul; holds American support for international peacekeeping presence will boost Pres Hamid Karzai's efforts to build strong central government</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For months the government of Hamid Karzai has pleaded for peacekeeping forces from the United States and other countries to help secure Afghanistan's unruly countryside. The Defense Department has argued, for just as long, that the United States has more urgent tasks, such as chasing down the remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. Now, in a welcome reversal, the Bush administration appears ready to use some of its troops to stabilize areas of Afghanistan outside the capital. The change in approach needs to be made expeditiously, while American officials work to persuade other countries to join the effort.</p>
        <p>With bombings and other attacks still being directed against Mr. Karzai's government, the security situation in Kabul is far short of satisfactory. But conditions are worse in the rest of the country, where warlords, bandits and fugitive Taliban forces run rampant. In some instances, the Pentagon has aggravated the situation by allying American forces with anti-Taliban warlords, giving them license and resources to control their territory. Enhancing their power can only undermine the central government in the capital.</p>

        <p>For months the government of Hamid Karzai has pleaded for peacekeeping forces from the United States and other countries to help secure Afghanistan's unruly countryside. The Defense Department has argued, for just as long, that the United States has more urgent tasks, such as chasing down the remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. Now, in a welcome reversal, the Bush administration appears ready to use some of its troops to stabilize areas of Afghanistan outside the capital. The change in approach needs to be made expeditiously, while American officials work to persuade other countries to join the effort.</p>
        <p>With bombings and other attacks still being directed against Mr. Karzai's government, the security situation in Kabul is far short of satisfactory. But conditions are worse in the rest of the country, where warlords, bandits and fugitive Taliban forces run rampant. In some instances, the Pentagon has aggravated the situation by allying American forces with anti-Taliban warlords, giving them license and resources to control their territory. Enhancing their power can only undermine the central government in the capital.</p>
        <p>President Bush has many times expressed an aversion to using American troops for peacekeeping or ''nation building.'' But Pentagon officials have lately begun to realize that the longer it takes to build a strong central Afghan government in command of its own security forces, the longer it will be before American troops can leave Afghanistan. The United States cannot ask other countries like Turkey, currently leading international security forces in Kabul, to perform peacekeeping duties without making a contribution of its own.</p>
        <p>The United States is right to set a long-term goal of establishing an effective Afghan Army. But this is as much a political challenge as a military one. Mr. Karzai has some distance to go before learning how to stitch together the disparate factions that have held sway in his country, in some cases for centuries. Expanded American support for an international peacekeeping presence will go a long way toward helping him reach that goal.</p>
