        <p>Steve Bornstein, a former president of ESPN and of ABC Television, was named an adviser to the N.F.L. yesterday to provide advice on television and media issues.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to help them sort out their options and strategies, particularly in the area of digital TV,'' Bornstein said.</p>
        <p>The league is looking to shift its ''NFL Sunday Ticket'' package of up to 14 Sunday afternoon games from DirecTV to digital cable, which would significantly increase its availability. Subscribers to DirecTV's package receive all the out-of-market games they cannot get locally.</p>
        <p>The league's deal with DirecTV expires after this season. The only way for the N.F.L. to make the change next season is to negotiate the approval of CBS and Fox, which carry the Sunday games on broadcast TV and do not want the value of their packages to be diminished by a widely available cable option.</p>
        <p>If the N.F.L. cannot please CBS and Fox, it would have to wait to make its change until the 2006 season when the networks' deals expire.</p>
