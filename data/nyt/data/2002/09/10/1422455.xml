        <p>United Airlines quietly decided over weekend to fall in line with other carriers and impose tight new restrictions on nonrefundable fares; air travelers will be confined to their seats for 30 minutes after takeoff and before landing if flying into or out of vicinity of New York and Washington this week under temporary flight restrictions put in effect by Transportation Security Administration in connection with public commemorations of anniversary of Sept 11 terrorist attacks; Travel Industry Association of America says more than 359,000 travel industry jobs have been lost since Sept 11 terrorist attacks, 273,000 of them in first three months after attacks; holds domestic travel spending fell $27 billion, to $455 billion, in 2001 and will probably drop another $2 billion this year; says individual business trips dropped to 206.6 million in 2001 from 212.9 million in 2003; Boyd Group, in Airports: USA report, says by 2005, domestic air passenger traffic will still be 9 percent below 2000 levels (Memo Pad column) (M)</p>

        <p>United Airlines Joins the Crowd</p>
        <p>Airlines tend to behave with the furtiveness of burglars when announcing bad news.</p>
        <p>That's why you probably haven't heard yet that United Airlines, widely credited last week as being the only major carrier not to follow the pack with tight new restrictions on nonrefundable fares, quietly fell in line over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Starting Oct. 1, customers buying nonrefundable tickets on United need to use them or lose them. That puts them in the same situation as passengers on American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and US Airways, That is, nonrefundable tickets will no longer be good as credit toward another flight, for one year, if not used on the flight date. Under the new policies, nonrefundable tickets can be rebooked only on or before the original departure date.</p>
        <p>Like other airlines, United also revised policies for standby flying on nonrefundable tickets. This is the sort of itinerary change required, for example, by a business traveler who misses an afternoon flight because a meeting ran long and wants to book a later one. Under the new policies, starting Jan. 1, passengers wanting to fly standby on the date of departure of their ticket will be charged a $100 fee.</p>
        <p>''We've joined the pack on these issues,'' Joe Hopkins, a United spokesman, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Unlike other airlines, United did not issue a news release to announce its policy change. Other airlines, used the quiet Labor Day weekend to announce their new policies.</p>
        <p>Airlines are alarmed about nonrefundable tickets because in the last 18 months business travelers have been using them in large numbers rather than pay far higher prices for unrestricted, fully refundable tickets. Corporate travel managers have said that the new policies on nonrefundables will drive even more business travelers to low-fare airlines, or to alternate ways of doing business.</p>
        <p>Restrictions Around Sept. 11</p>
        <p>If you're flying into or out of the vicinity of New York and Washington this week, you'll be confined to your seat for 30 minutes after takeoff and before landing, under temporary flight restrictions put in effect by the federal Transportation Security Administration in connection with public commemorations of the anniversary of the Sept. 11 catastrophe.</p>
        <p>The restrictions, covering about a 34.5-mile radius of the sites that were attacked, will be in effect in the New York area from 7 a.m. tomorrow until 8 p.m. Friday, and in the Washington area from 8:30 a.m until 11 a.m. tomorrow, the federal agency said. The restrictions are a temporary expansion of the so-called 30-minute seat rule that has been in effect since October; they will remain in effect indefinitely at Reagan National Airport.</p>
        <p>Terrorist Toll On Travel Industry</p>
        <p>How badly hit was domestic leisure and business travel by the terrorist attacks? The Travel Industry Association of America, the travel business trade group, offers some sobering statistics:</p>
        <p>*More than 359,000 travel industry jobs lost; 273,000 of them in the first three months after Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>*Domestic travel spending fell $27 billion, to $455 billion, in 2001 and will probably drop another $2 billion this year.</p>
        <p>*Individual business trips dropped to 206.6 million in 2001 from 212.9 million in 2000. A slight recovery, to 209.4 million, is projected for this year, but business trips will not reach 2000 levels until 2003, the travel group said.</p>
        <p>New Forecasts For Air Travel</p>
        <p>Growth projections for air travel that were made before last September are out the window, according to a new passenger traffic forecast, ''Airports: USA,'' published by the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting company.</p>
        <p>By 2005, domestic air passenger traffic will still be 9 percent below 2000 levels, the company said. By comparison, federal aviation forecasts published in 2000 -- which still form the basis of planning at some airports -- said that passenger traffic would grow to 767.4 million passengers in 2005 from 639.8 million passengers in 2000.</p>
