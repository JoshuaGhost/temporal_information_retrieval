        <p>The next major battlefront in Nassau County's fiscal crisis is shaping up as a cost-cutting clash that pits the police unions against popular services like buses and parks and programs for teenagers and the elderly.</p>
        <p>The county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, is warning the unions that if they continue to refuse to yield tens of millions of dollars in contract givebacks, he will be forced to slash funds for other services, including day care, drug and alcohol treatment programs and museums.</p>
        <p>''It's an either/or situation,'' Mr. Suozzi said on Thursday in a preview of his first proposed budget for 2003, and a revision of the four-year fiscal recovery plan he issued in the spring. He will submit the two documents to the County Legislature on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Though the targets for cuts are dear to many constituents and legislators, Mr. Suozzi said he did not single them out to gain political leverage against the unions. Instead, he said, they are among the few areas of discretionary spending that can be reduced, unlike mandatory services like public health, welfare and sewage disposal.</p>
        <p>''These are really good services,'' Mr. Suozzi said of the threatened programs. ''But if we don't get the labor concessions from the cops that we're looking for, we're going to list the specific programs we have to cut.''</p>
        <p>Among the county executive's demands is that the police accept a three-year pay freeze, arguing that Nassau cannot afford raises on top of last year's average pay of $100,000 per officer, including overtime.</p>
        <p>The chief union spokesman, Gary DelaRaba, president of the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association, did not return calls for comment. But the battle lines are already set. The union is pressing a lawsuit for a new contract, an arbitration over staffing and charges of unfair labor practices against the county. It plans to begin collecting $1 a day from each of its roughly 2,500 members to build a $1 million-a-year media campaign treasury.</p>
        <p>In its latest broadside, the union published a 14-page pamphlet with a cover photo of the county executive. The text begins: ''Like a cowboy fresh off a cattle drive, Mr. Suozzi rode into town hooting and hollering. A-stomping and a-whipping, screaming and yelling, threatening and intimidating. Trying to bully and scare everyone half to death.''</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Suozzi's budget, Mr. DelaRaba wrote in the pamphlet: ''His four-year plan is faulty because it is based on assumptions that are unattainable regarding concessions by the county work force.''</p>
        <p>On the other side of the issue, alarm has spread among the groups whose services are threatened with cuts. ''Folks were stunned at the level of cutbacks that was discussed'' at a briefing last week, said Jack O'Connell, executive director of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, an association of nonprofit programs. In many cases, he said, the cuts would virtually eliminate services.</p>
        <p>While the groups are sympathetic to the county's fiscal crisis, Mr. O'Connell said: ''I think people in the room were unwilling to say that we should be sort of pitted against the police, or that we should be fighting for police cuts or layoffs. We don't want to be part of divide-and-conquer.''</p>
        <p>But, he added: ''The police need to become part of the solution, and so far they haven't been. It's time for the police to step up to plate and do what we did in 1999'' in taking cuts. He noted that a poll earlier this year by proponents of a county income tax showed that Nassau residents ranked several social service needs as higher priorities than the police.</p>
        <p>Besides approval from the Legislature, Mr. Suozzi's 2003 budget and four-year plan also need to be reviewed by the Nassau Interim Finance Agency. The agency is an oversight board the state imposed when it granted bailout aid to Nassau after fiscal mismanagement under a Republican county administration. Mr. Suozzi, Nassau's first Democratic executive in three decades, took over Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Although many details are still being fine-tuned, the broad outlines of the approximately $2 billion budget and fiscal plan are already known.</p>
        <p>The budget will levy a 19.4 percent increase in the county portion of the property tax, which accounts for about a fifth of the typical property tax bill.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Suozzi has vowed not to raise property taxes for the rest of his four-year-term, he is considering a change for the next term that would index them to rise at the rate of inflation. He is also considering extending the sales tax to home heating oil, which is now exempt, and raising the sales tax by a fourth of a percent. The combined state and county sales tax is now 8.5 percent.</p>
        <p>In a seeming contradiction, Mr. Suozzi's budget message will bear both bad news and good news.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a pretty bleak picture we're going to present,'' Mr. Suozzi said. ''Everything just got a lot worse.''</p>
        <p>Besides the deficits he inherited, new problems have cropped up. The sluggish economy is leading to a shortfall in sales tax revenue. Declining investments in the state pension fund caused a quadrupling of the county's annual pension bill. And the costs of Medicaid and employee health insurance are soaring.</p>
        <p>Those factors, and a conservative assumption that the economy will not rebound anytime soon, could add more than $100 million to the annual budget gap in future years, the county budget office says.</p>
        <p>Yet the near-term outlook -- next year's budget -- is quite positive. ''For 2003, we think we're in very, very good shape,'' Mr. Suozzi said.</p>
        <p>The reason is additional savings from staff reductions. The county originally planned to eliminate 430 jobs this year, but the cuts are now projected to reach 950. Jobs are being cut through voluntary early retirements, normal attrition, consolidations and firings but, so far, no layoffs.</p>
        <p>Once the 2003 budget is settled, the debate will intensify over Mr. Suozzi's demand for union givebacks versus his threatened cuts in other programs. ''Nobody wants it -- these are the least popular cuts,'' said the Legislature's presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat. ''The unions, especially the P.B.A., have to work it out.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Suozzi's original fiscal plan called for $65 million in union concessions, so far he has not been able wrest any agreements.</p>
        <p>''That's a big zero in the savings column,'' said Edward Ward, a spokesman for the Legislature's Republican minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt.</p>
        <p>''Labor is the elephant in the middle of the room'' that everyone has been avoiding, he said. Pausing to politically update the expression, he added: ''Now it's the donkey in the middle of the room.''</p>
