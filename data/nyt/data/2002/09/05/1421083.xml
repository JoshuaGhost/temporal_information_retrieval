        <p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said on Wednesday that for the first time in two years he saw signs that peace talks with the Palestinians might be possible.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said today that for the first time in two years he saw signs that peace talks with the Palestinians might be possible as a result of Israel's tough measures.</p>
        <p>''Now, for the first time, I see an opportunity for a breakthrough in a diplomatic arrangement,'' Mr. Sharon told Israel's Channel Two in one of the series of interviews that Israeli prime ministers traditionally give before the Jewish New Year.</p>
        <p>''It won't be an easy thing,'' he said, ''but there is a possibility. The Palestinians have arrived at the conclusion that nothing can be achieved using terror.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon offered a comforting assessment of Israel's condition, declaring that his government had prevented economic instability over the past year, and that the country was prepared for an Iraqi attack against Israel if the United States attacked Iraq.</p>
        <p>But the comments about potential talks with the Palestinians coincided with a report in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot that Mr. Sharon had agreed to meet with an unnamed senior Palestinian official in the next few days. They came as signs emerged that ranking Palestinians were seeking an end to the violence, including a denunciation of suicide attacks, by the Palestinian interior minister, Abdel Razak Yehiyeh.</p>
        <p>There were also fresh indications that the Palestinians were becoming more public in their criticism of the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat -- one of them a harshly critical open letter to Mr. Arafat in Arabic-language newspapers in London and the West Bank, written by a former Palestinian minister.</p>
        <p>In another conciliatory sign, Mr. Sharon and Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer announced on Tuesday that they would allow the Palestinian Legislative Council to meet in Ramallah next Monday for the first time in more than a year.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Yehiyeh has been the most visible Palestinian leader in trying to tamp down the violence. In an interview with Yediot Ahronot last Friday, he said he was demanding that all the factions, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, adopt nonviolent methods of resistance.</p>
        <p>The signs of anti-Arafat feeling have emerged concurrently, chief among them the open letter by Nabil Amr, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Mr. Amr said Palestinian leaders had failed to develop serious and credible institutions or a rule of law. He also went further than any Palestinian up to now in suggesting that the Palestinians had missed a major opportunity by rejecting the offers made by the former Israeli administration at Camp David. ''Today, after two years of bloodshed, we call for exactly what we refused, only after we became sure it was impossible to achieve.''</p>
