        <p>The Police Department's online database for tracking domestic violence cases has failed to meet many of its objectives, according to an audit released yesterday by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. The audit found that the $1.17 million domestic violence tracking system is not adequately linked to the Department of Probation, and that many users find it cumbersome. The Police Department said that it agreed with many of the recommendations and that it had already started to address the problems.</p>
