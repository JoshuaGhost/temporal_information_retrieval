        <p>HELENA TILLMAN lives a simple life at Peternana Terrace, an apartment complex for the elderly in Freeport. She goes for short walks in the building's courtyard, but mostly she sits on the yellow benches out front and visits with her friends.</p>
        <p>She is able to do these things only with the help of her personal care aide, Jessie Carter, who has been at her side 24 hours a day, five days a week, for nearly a year. Mrs. Tillman, 74, is unsteady on her feet because of a stroke. The kidney dialysis she undergoes three times a week leaves her tired and weak. And she is too forgetful to cook for herself or keep track of the 13 medications she takes for her high blood pressure, seizures, diabetes and dialysis-related treatment.</p>
        <p>''I depend on Jessie for everything,'' Mrs. Tillman said. ''I don't know what I'd do without her.''</p>
        <p>But she has had to contemplate that possibility because officials from the Nassau County Department of Social Services have threatened to take away her aide, who is provided through Medicaid. After a routine reassessment of Mrs. Tillman's needs last spring, the county ruled that she was eligible for only three hours of service a day and would therefore lose her aide completely because her ''health and safety cannot be assured without 24-hour supervision.''</p>
        <p>The county's logic frustrated and confounded Mrs. Tillman's daughter, Patricia Toval, who cares for her mother on weekends. ''Even though my mother has some quality of life right now living in her own apartment, they're basically telling me they want to institutionalize her,'' Ms. Toval said. They have appealed the county's decision and are awaiting a hearing date.</p>
        <p>''My mother doesn't have much more time because she's an end-stage renal patient,'' Ms. Toval added. ''So why shouldn't she be able to spend her last days in a place where she's happy?''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tillman is not alone. Lawyers and social workers who represent elderly residents receiving some form of county-supervised home care say they have seen dozens of cases like Mrs. Tillman's in recent months. They say these cuts are the first significant ones since Thomas R. Suozzi became county executive in January, and they worry that even tougher times lie ahead with Mr. Suozzi's recent threat to make severe additional cuts in the county's social services spending.</p>
        <p>''We've seen a lot of people getting notices reducing their hours or taking away their services completely even though there hasn't been any change in their health status,'' said Jane Reinhardt, a senior lawyer at Nassau Suffolk Law Services. The legal aid agency has received more than two dozen such cases since the spring.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Cona, a lawyer from Garden City, said the cuts in home care ''have been across the board, with no distinction based on a client's medical needs or what their doctors say.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reinhardt and Ms. Cona said that so far they have been successful in maintaining services for clients who have appealed proposed cuts. ''My concern is all the unrepresented people who don't know to make the noise they need to keep their services,'' Ms. Cona said. ''I think it is somewhat of a crisis.''</p>
        <p>County officials acknowledge that the home care rolls have been trimmed in recent months to ease the county's persistent budget deficit.</p>
        <p>Mitchell Sahn, executive director of health and human services in Nassau, said, ''we don't want to make these cuts, and these were not easy decisions for the county executive.'' But the county's fiscal troubles left Mr. Suozzi little choice but to cut back in an area where the county historically has provided generous service, he said.</p>
        <p>In fact, the county last year was fined $1.25 million by the state for exceeding a state cap on expenditures for personal care aides. ''We were penalized for spending more money on providing home care to seniors than the state wanted us to,'' Mr. Sahn said. ''We're disappointed, but we have to go through this process of assessing people and we're being pressured to cut back on the amount of money we spend.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cona said it was well known that the state had targeted Nassau County for exceeding the state average on home care. ''But that isn't something the county should be punished for since it helps keep people at home, which costs less than nursing homes,'' she said. ''And we shouldn't want to force people into nursing homes anyway, even aside from the dollar issue.''</p>
        <p>Greg Olsen, executive director of the New York State Coalition for the Aging, agreed. Home care programs that allow elderly people to stay in their own homes are not only generally cheaper than nursing homes, he said, but also ''people heal better and have better outcomes at home because it's where they want to be.''</p>
        <p>County officials also stress that the county would not be in this bind if the state and federal governments picked up more of the Medicaid bill. While Medicaid services are federally mandated, the federal government pays only 50 percent, with the state and county each picking up 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Gertrude Goldfarb had exhausted virtually all of her savings on health care costs early this year, when she applied for Medicaid. At 89, Mrs. Goldfarb is frail and forgetful. She complains bitterly that she can no longer enjoy her favorite foods because she must be fed through a feeding tube in her stomach. ''That really bothers me,'' she said. She spends most of her days in bed or in a wheelchair in her home in Long Beach with the help of an aide whom she has paid for out of her own pocket.</p>
        <p>Her application to have Medicaid pay for her aide initially was denied, with the same reasoning used in Mrs. Tillman's denial -- she was eligible for 4 hours of service but because she needed 24-hour care, she would get nothing. Mrs. Goldfarb's daughter, Susan Bank, appealed and was told recently that the application would be approved.</p>
        <p>''It made no sense that instead of trying to keep her at home for $700 a week, they wanted to put her in a nursing home for $8,000 to $10,000 a month,'' Ms. Bank said. ''And at this stage of the game, she really wants to be at home.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Suozzi announced his four-year financial plan in April, he said that he planned to cut a county-financed home care program for the elderly by 25 percent, from $2.8 million to $2.1 million. Even advocates for the elderly say the program goes beyond federally mandated services for the elderly. While the county program is intended for elderly residents on limited incomes, the county has never had a means test for participants. The county program provides aides who only do housekeeping and cooking.</p>
        <p>Medicaid, on the other hand, has strict limits on income and savings. The Medicaid home care program also provides aides who might bathe a client or dispense medication in addition to performing household chores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sahn said some people had been knocked off the rolls for home care, but only after being carefully evaluated and determined to be ineligible under federal guidelines or after a nursing assessment finds them inappropriate for the program. ''We don't do this arbitrarily,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Scott Stepp, a spokesman for Catholic Charities, said that case managers from his agency first noticed in late spring that county officials were evaluating needs and allocating hours more stringently. People who had been receiving services have faced losing them and new applicants have been receiving much lower levels of care than would have been the case a year ago, he said. ''It's clear that fewer hours are being given in cases where they are badly needed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Marina Tirado had been living in the Malverne home of her daughter Millie Roman for about 10 years with the help of an aide who came for 10 hours a day, seven days a week. But county officials eliminated Mrs. Tirado's weekend aide last spring.</p>
        <p>''They told me either I would have to pay for the aide out of my own pocket or just deal with the fact that we were getting fewer hours,'' Ms. Roman said. Caring for her 93-year-old mother, who suffered from congestive heart failure and was unable to walk unassisted, was already a major commitment for Ms. Roman. She would rush home from her job in Manhattan each night, fearful that a delay on the Long Island Rail Road might mean that her mother would be left alone.</p>
        <p>''Whenever an aide wasn't there, I was there,'' Ms. Roman said. Losing the weekend aide made it difficult for Ms. Roman to do basic things like shop for groceries or go to church on Sunday. ''But they don't take those things into consideration, they just want to cut the budget,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They appealed the service cut, but Mrs. Tirado's health took a turn for the worse over the summer and she died on Aug. 15. ''The agencies don't care that there aren't enough services that you can fall back on,'' Ms. Roman said. ''It breaks my heart that other elderly people must be dealing with this too because they're defenseless. They don't speak up and sometimes they don't even know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Olsen said that while it is often more economical to keep an elderly person at home than in a nursing home, ''there has always been a bias towards institutional care.'' While nursing homes are considered an entitlement under Medicaid, he said, home care programs are not.</p>
        <p>But he noted that Governor Pataki signed a bill earlier this month that will create a coordinating council to help the state develop a comprehensive plan to keep more people out of nursing homes and in their own communities. The bill was a response to a 1999 Supreme Court decision that ruled it discriminatory to place people in institutions if they can receive the services they need in the community.</p>
        <p>''It was a very important bill,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''But we're still just at the beginning of what will be a long and hopefully productive dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Jack O'Connell, executive director of the Health and Welfare Council of Long Island, said the federal government should bear more of the burden of caring for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, what we're seeing is 25 years of bad national policy when it comes to dealing with the vulnerable elderly,'' he said. ''But with all the talk of doomsday budget cuts to get the county out of its current fiscal mess, the county could easily undertake more measures similar to these cuts, and that's what's scary to us all.''</p>
