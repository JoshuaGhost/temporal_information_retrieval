        <p>Hands-on exhibits on water, sound, astronomy and natural history are featured in a new outdoor science park at the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich, Vt., on the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>A 250-foot-long watercourse snakes down from the museum building toward the river. Visitors can plop a table-tennis ball into the artificial brook and watch it meander down a series of terraces. At several places along the flow, young hydrologists can maneuver miniature dams and sluices to alter the volume and direction of the water. Another exhibit lets visitors make their own waterworks by connecting plastic pipes to several gurgling fountains.</p>

        <p>Hands-on exhibits on water, sound, astronomy and natural history are featured in a new outdoor science park at the Montshire Museum of Science in Norwich, Vt., on the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>A 250-foot-long watercourse snakes down from the museum building toward the river. Visitors can plop a table-tennis ball into the artificial brook and watch it meander down a series of terraces. At several places along the flow, young hydrologists can maneuver miniature dams and sluices to alter the volume and direction of the water. Another exhibit lets visitors make their own waterworks by connecting plastic pipes to several gurgling fountains.</p>
        <p>There is plenty for budding naturalists. An animal-song kiosk plays recordings of New England bird and insect noises, helping hikers recognize the real thing on nearby trails. Behind the building, children and adults can hear music made by a basalt xylophone, touch a bear track or gaze through a giant kaleidoscope.</p>
        <p>Another exhibit geared to youngsters is a walking tour of the solar system. Starting from a bright red model of the Sun, they encounter scale models of each of the nine planets, each proportionately spaced along the route. Distant Pluto is at the end of the 1.6-mile walk.</p>
        <p>The science park leads out onto several new trails and natural habitat areas, including a two-acre meadow that has a demonstration plot for native grasses and native fruit-bearing shrubs.</p>
        <p>Montshire is in central Vermont off Exit 13 of I-91, across the river from Hanover, N.H. It is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily (some outdoor water exhibits will close until spring at the end of this month). Admission is $6.50; ages 3 to 17, $5.50. Information: (802) 649-2200 or www.montshire.org.</p>
