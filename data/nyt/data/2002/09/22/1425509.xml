        <p>The doctor who developed the artificial kidney despite serious equipment shortages in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and the doctor who later adapted it to extend the lives of millions are among the five winners of the 2002 Lasker awards for medical research.</p>
        <p>The winners of the clinical research award, announced yesterday by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, are Dr. Willem J. Kolff, 91, who worked at the University of Utah School of Medicine after the war, and Dr. Belding H. Scribner, 81, of the University of Washington School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Their work on the treatment, also known as dialysis, not only transformed kidney failure from a fatal disease to a treatable one, but also gave rise to the discipline of medical bioethics, said the award citation. In the artificial kidney's infancy there were too few of the devices to treat all patients who needed dialysis, and committees had to decide who might continue to live.</p>
        <p>Dr. James E. Rothman, 51, of the Sloan-Kettering Institute in Manhattan and Dr. Randy W. Schekman, 53, of the University of California at Berkeley won the Lasker basic medical research award for discovering a process that cells use to organize their function and to communicate with their environment.</p>
        <p>The research had to overcome extraordinary opposition, the foundation said, noting that Dr. Schekman's first application for a government grant had been ''trounced'' by peer reviewers who thought the concept would not work.</p>
        <p>The fifth recipient is Dr. James E. Darnell, 72, of the Rockefeller University in Manhattan, who won the award for special achievement in medical science. Dr. Darnell was cited for breakthroughs in the understanding of gene regulation; opening avenues for treatment of anemia and cancer; guiding the careers of more than 125 young scientists; and writing two major textbooks on virology and molecular biology. Each of the five winners will receive $25,000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Darnell helped scientists understand that genes could work differently in bacteria from the way they work in animals and plants. He later discovered a simple path by which cells of mammals transmit signals from the environment to the nucleus. The process helps cells program their genes to respond to signals from their environment.</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Darnell discovered in the 1980's that a liver cell could remain a liver cell only when it stayed in the liver. He found that without constant signals from their normal place in the organ, liver cells lost a crucial molecular component known as messenger RNA that helps give them their identity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Darnell also found the clearest example of how the surface of a cell signals genes in its nucleus. The signaling shows how cells directly respond to a type of hormone known as cytokines and to growth factors. The signaling is important in resisting infections and in inducing production of proteins known as STAT's, which play major roles in the origin and survival of cancer cells.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kolff's work on the artificial kidney began in 1938, when he developed a blood-filtering device to capture the poisonous waste products that the kidneys normally eliminate in urine. The first filter came from sausage casing.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Dr. Kolff used ingenuity to scavenge needles, rubber tubing and other materials to build model devices. In September 1945, just after the war, he achieved success with his fifth device, temporarily restoring consciousness to a 67-year-old woman.</p>
        <p>After the war, Dr. Kolff sent artificial kidneys to other countries, where doctors used them as temporary treatment to help patients survive acute kidney failure.</p>
        <p>In Seattle, Dr. Scribner's team developed a U-shaped device that could be placed in a patient permanently, with one end attached to a vein and the other to an artery. The device allowed tubes to be connected to a device for dialysis.</p>
        <p>Over time, artificial kidneys have supported many patients while they waited for the kidney transplants that eliminate the need for dialysis.</p>
        <p>This year was the first time Dr. Kolff, who later did pioneering work in developing devices for the heart and other organs, and Dr. Scribner had been nominated for a Lasker award, Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, the chairman of the jury that selects the winners, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rothman and Dr. Schekman were cited for unveiling the way a process known as cellular membrane trafficking orchestrates many crucial functions. They include communication between nerve cells, secretion of insulin and other hormones, and uptake of nutrients.</p>
        <p>Cells are structured like compartmentalized factories. Tiny saclike containers, known as vesicles, ferry proteins and other vital products through the interior of cells from one site to another. Vesicles pinch off, or bud, from one membrane and then fuse with another membrane.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the 1970's, the two scientists have helped clarify how the many types of vesicles are formed, then know where to go, and how they fuse with target structures to release their contents once they reach their destination.</p>
        <p>This process allows cellular compartments to establish and maintain their specialized functions, averting the anarchy that would result if the cell's contents commingled. The process explains how embryos release growth factors to stimulate organ development. It also plays a crucial role in the way viruses infect cells.</p>
        <p>Defects in the system can lead to a number of diseases, including adult-onset or Type 2 diabetes, in which cells cannot use a sugar, glucose, in the blood. The reason is that glucose-importing molecules are stranded in vesicles inside the cells.</p>
        <p>Researchers are trying to manipulate the trafficking system to treat brain disorders. The scientists used different strategies to tackle the problem of cellular trafficking.</p>
