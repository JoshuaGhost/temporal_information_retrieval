        <p>SOME years ago, Ignacio Blanco opened many Fairfield County eyes to the diversity and joys of Spanish cooking in his restaurant Meson Galicia.</p>
        <p>Now he is at it again.</p>
        <p>The locale is the same, but the name has been changed to Meigas (Galician for ''sorceresses'').</p>
        <p>A new chef and an imaginative new menu are demonstrating that there is much more to contemporary Spanish cooking than paella and flan, delicious as they both can be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blanco, who was born in Galicia, in northwestern Spain, admits that he and his Basque chef, Luis Bollo, have been influenced -- as many international chefs have -- by the adventurous cooking of Ferran Adrià, the three-star Michelin chef at El Bulli in Rosas, Spain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adrià deconstructs food to foams and emulsions for the most intense flavor.</p>
        <p>When our first appetizers arrived, I thought, Oh no, not a Spanish version of nouvelle cuisine, with prettified presentations that obscure the flavor.</p>
        <p>One bite of my mollejas y sepia convinced me I was wrong; the taste was even better than the looks. A few more bites turned simple pleasure into exuberance.</p>
        <p>Sweetbreads, lightly browned with garlic slices, roosted on a round cake of braised cuttle fish and caramelized onions. The disparate flavors accented one another beautifully.</p>
        <p>This was a pattern that emerged in almost every dish my foursome ordered at Meigas. The standouts included grilled octopus (the most tender ever, with bacon, roasted potatoes, garlic and sherry vinegar sauce); txipirones (baby squid in squid ink and Txacoll white wine, with fat-grained Basque Montsia rice); and ventresca de atun (exquisitely rare breast of tuna lightly grilled).</p>
        <p>Duck breast (combined happily with mango, Granja white beans, toasted pine nuts, watercress salad and citrus sauce) was also among the standouts as was costilla de ternera (fork-tender veal short ribs braised in Rioja red wine, ginger and caramelized garlic, on a bed of cabbage stuffed with potatoes, spinach and dried apricots).</p>
        <p>A lunchtime entree of bacalao proved to this skeptic how delicious codfish can be, if prepared the Meigas way: house-cured, slow-cooked, served atop cauliflower and mashed potatoes (tinted pale orange by a paprika oil-infusion), along with sundried tomatoes, black olives, codfish gelatin, garlic, parsley and an emulsion of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
        <p>It was a wow!</p>
        <p>Even a demitasse of two gazpachos (a delightful lagniappe) -- purées of green and yellow peppers, each occupying half of a tiny cup -- offered a concentrated, garlic-pungent flavor.</p>
        <p>Nowhere did this intensity reveal itself more consistently than in dessert, not usually the pinnacle of a Spanish meal. Fair warning: at the new Meigas, skip anything else but never, under pain of self-punishment, omit the desserts. Each one is a work of art to look at, amplified by fabulous flavor fusions.</p>
        <p>The chocolate croquettes consisted of four toasted almond-covered balls with warm, soft, dark chocolate interiors, alongside a cube of lemon gelatin, topped by coconut foam and served on four porcelain spoons. Each spoonful was meant to be consumed in one bite, which provided an explosion of flavors and textures in the mouth for a truly sybaritic experience.</p>
        <p>There are six desserts, each tastier than the last, plus seasonal fresh fruit and a cheese plate featuring excellent Spanish cheeses. But for new, ambrosial sensations, concentrate on one of the six creations.</p>
        <p>Among them are chocolate custard (served in layers with orange and an ethereal Arzua cream cheese -- a triad of color that tasted even richer than it looked); torrija (Nevat goat cheese ice cream, bread pudding and sweet and sour strawberry sauce -- an incredible taste combination that defies description); and a refreshingly cool leche merengada con crema de avellanas (praline cream, creamy ice milk infused with cinnamon, vanilla, lemon and caramelized rice).</p>
        <p>Such an experience does not come cheap. A three-course dinner for two cost $85 and was worth every penny. Tax, tip and drinks were extra.</p>
        <p>From a well-selected Spanish wine list, we enjoyed a refreshing Albarino de Fenfinanes white wine from Galicia at $48 one evening and, later, a satisfying Oliver Conti '97, a Cataluna red wine at $65, from a small vineyard in the Ampurdan area.</p>
        <p>Meigas presents superb examples of a new style of Spanish cooking. The results clearly merit a rating of ''Excellent-Plus.''</p>
