        <p>As drivers edge toward Manhattan on the Cross Bronx Expressway, official highway signs direct them toward places like Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital.

        <p>As drivers edge toward Manhattan on the Cross Bronx Expressway, official highway signs direct them toward places like Yankee Stadium, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital. This summer, someone decided one more South Bronx attraction was worth plugging, and up went two very visible, very unofficial green-on-white signs that read: ''Auto Glass Shops: Exit Jerome Avenue.''</p>
        <p>A dozen auto glass shops sit just off Exit 2A, where a replacement for a taillight or a windshield can be picked from thousands of used parts that hang from chain-link fences and are stacked on shelves.</p>
        <p>The signs, which direct drivers to a decidedly downtrodden stretch under the elevated No. 4 train that also includes mechanics and used-car dealers, started a buzz among the businesses, but no one knows who put them up. At least, no one is fessing up.</p>
        <p>''They've been up two and a half months, and no one knows where they came from,'' said Joey Santiago, whose family has run Best Auto Glass for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Joshua Pérez, a freelance auto glass man who works for several of the businesses, says he thinks owners of newer shops installed the signs to attract customers from New Jersey who usually patronized more distant glass shops in Hunts Point.</p>
        <p>''Whoever put it on didn't tell no one,'' Mr. Pérez added. ''They didn't put it up in the daytime, I'll tell you that much.''</p>
        <p>Raúl Santos, who works at a shop on Inwood Avenue that is somewhat removed from the highway, guessed that the guilty party was one of the first businesses drivers would see.</p>
        <p>But Wilson Concepción, a manager of Cross Bronx Auto Glass, the first shop from the highway, said his company was not the culprit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santiago theorized that the signs were part of an economic development plan. ''I think the city did it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fat chance.</p>
        <p>''They're obviously not sanctioned by the city or the state,'' said Jennifer M. Nelson of the State Department of Transportation. On Thursday, the city's Department of Transportation dispatched a crew that took the signs down.</p>
