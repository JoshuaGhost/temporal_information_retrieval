        <p>An effort by Gov. James E. McGreevey to take a bigger role in overseeing New Jersey's investment funds drew accusations today that the $73 billion investment portfolio could become an avenue for patronage.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey and the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, dissatisfied with the funds' performance in a declining stock market, scored a victory Thursday when the council that handles state investments unexpectedly ousted the chairman and replaced him with one of the governor's recent appointees.</p>
        <p>The new chairman, Orin Kramer, is an investment banker who has been a major Democratic fund-raiser and was the finance chairman of Mr. McGreevey's campaign in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer said, ''I do not have a hidden agenda'' for the 11-member State Investment Council.</p>
        <p>He suggested, however, as Mr. McCormac has, that the state consider hiring outside managers for at least some assets. The suggestion renewed suspicions that the council would be pushed into using private brokerage firms, which the state has not done since 1950.</p>
        <p>Republican legislators and some officials of public employee unions charged today that the promise of huge fees for managing the funds would invite political interference.</p>
        <p>''The State Investment Council has existed as a professional, nonpolitical, nonpartisan entity for over 50 years,'' said State Senator Robert Littell, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''To put our public employee pensions in the hands of major campaign contributors is just plain wrong.''</p>
        <p>Banks and venture capital firms have lobbied for years to pry some business from the state's in-house staff of traders and analysts, but such proposals were rarely considered seriously until stock market losses battered the funds.</p>
        <p>The total portfolio, most of which is pension funds, has lost about $21 billion since August 2000, prompting Mr. McCormac to call for re-examining the heavy reliance on stocks that paid off so handsomely in the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>''I've got to find out why we're doing so badly,'' Mr. McCormac said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCormac's predecessor, Roland Machold, who also managed the state's investment programs for 23 years, said that ''the council has done its job very well.''</p>
        <p>''California will tell you that, hiring as many money managers as they can, they still couldn't beat the market,'' Mr. Machold said.</p>
        <p>Most public employee unions also oppose significant changes in the funds' operation. ''Everybody is getting whacked by the market,'' said Jim Marketti, the president of the Communications Workers of America Local 1032 in Trenton. ''There's no evidence we've seen that states with outside managers have done any better.''</p>
        <p>The investment council has five members representing employee pension funds and six appointed by the governor. Mr. McGreevey has appointed three new members, including Mr. Kramer.</p>
        <p>The former chairman, Robert T. Hoffman, who was surprised by the vote to oust him on Thursday, said the administration was ''using the unfortunate losses in the pension plan as an excuse to move forward with a political agenda.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that there are two or three chosen managers out there that I believe the treasurer or the governor is trying to reward,'' said Mr. Hoffman, the managing partner of Candlewood Capital Management in Princeton. ''But the pool of potential contributors expands dramatically if you go to outside management.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer, a partner in Kramer Spellman, an investment management firm in New York, was a White House aide under President Jimmy Carter and has headed state commissions on public finances in New York and California.</p>
        <p>The state Republican chairman, Senator Joe Kyrillos, said in a statement today that Mr. Kramer was ''more than qualified'' for the new post but that ''given the McGreevey administration's history of intertwining politics with state government, I am concerned partisanship could play a role in Mr. Kramer assuming this position.''</p>
