        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>MIDDLESEX, by Jeffrey Eugenides. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $27.) A large, expansive, generous novel whose hero is its heroine as well, Cal (and Callie) Stephanides, a hermaphrodite from a Greek-American family who tests the gap between male and female, destiny and free will, growing up as a moral dialectic or a chemical reaction.</p>
        <p>EVA'S COUSIN, by Sibylle Knauss. (Ballantine, $24.95.) A German novel based on facts about a cousin of Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun; Marlene, the protagonist and narrator, is called to keep Eva company in the fateful summer of 1944, and is soon observing the war's end from a lonely and endangered position.</p>
        <p>THE WRITER AND THE WORLD, by V. S. Naipaul. (Knopf, $30.) A collection covering about three decades and divided into sections on India, Africa and America, by the Nobel Prize winner whose perpetual personal frame of reference and utter fearlessness about offending season his habitual gloom.</p>
        <p>WILL YOU MISS ME WHEN I'M GONE? The Carter Family and Their Legacy in American Music, by Mark Zwonitzer with Charles Hirshberg. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.) Products of Virginia, the original Carters -- two women and, often, a peculiar male voice -- seemed strange and beautiful in 1927, and seem so still.</p>
        <p>ELEANOR AND HARRY: The Correspondence of Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, edited by Steve Neal. (Lisa Drew/Scribner, $26.) Truman and Franklin Roosevelt's widow needed each other badly for their own agendas; their letters show a mutual wariness but respect and admiration as well.</p>
        <p>SEEING IN THE DARK: How Backyard Stargazers Are Probing Deep Space and Guarding Earth From Interplanetary Peril, by Timothy Ferris. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.) Ferris's profiles of professional and amateur observers, rendering their special experiences, are particularly rare and interesting.</p>
        <p>THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE, by Michel Faber. (Harcourt, $26.) A 19-year-old prostitute is the central character of this novel in which an empty and befouled late Victorian world is successfully confronted by nothing more than wit, determination and a good heart. The narrator, our educator and guide, examines the inner thoughts of the book's inhabitants until we learn to understand them for ourselves.</p>
        <p>THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS, by Paul Auster. (Holt, $24.) Metaphysics and mystery run free in this novel so full of levels that A narrates B narrating C narrating his own story, which is in a movie; the plot concerns a missing silent film comedian who has gone unmissing and a movie scholar who pursues him.</p>
        <p>NOBODY'S PERFECT: Writings From The New Yorker, by Anthony Lane. (Knopf, $35.) Film, literature and other passions explored in virtuosic prose by a writer whose cheerful temper never stands in the way of a brilliant line delivered with insouciance, and whose powers as a literary critic are of the first rank.</p>
