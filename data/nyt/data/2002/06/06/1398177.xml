      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Traditional French bistros are flirting with contemporary design. The point is not to veer too far from the authentic atmosphere and floor plan (a bistro is a restaurant with a counter where you can simply have a drink). Two such places, Le Martel and L'Auvergne Gourmande, have successfully freshened up -- attracting a younger set without losing the old one.</p>
        <p>A fashion and design crowd now gathers at Le Martel in the offbeat neighborhood of the 10th Arrondissement, just north of the Marais. Lorenzo Alati, 36, director for Benetton in France, bought the bistro, which is downstairs from his apartment, and asked an architect, Antonio Virga, to streamline the original features with off-white walls, hip graphics, dark wood furniture and a collection of contemporary black and white photographs. Artists who stop by are invited to decorate a wall mirror, above right.</p>

        <p>L'Auvergne Gourmande, above left, is a tiny bistro near the Eiffel Tower specializing in food from the Auvergne region. The owner, Jacques Boudon, brought in an interior designer, Fran√ßois Champsaur, 38, to add a violet ceiling, kraft paper lampshades and a communal table surrounded by high red chairs. (It's a big step for Parisians to eat next to someone they don't know.) Le Martel is at 3, rue Martel; (011) 33.1.47.70.67.56. L'Auvergne Gourmande is at 127, rue St.-Dominique; (011) 33.1.47.05.60.79.</p>
