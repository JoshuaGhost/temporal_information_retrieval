        <p>AUTOMATED teller machines have become so common, it now seems there are almost as many places to get cash as to spend it. Convenience stores, nightclubs and office buildings are all well supplied with A.T.M.'s. In a few big cities, cash machines have even begun popping up in the lobbies of large apartment buildings.</p>
        <p>When Sue Castroman, a law librarian in Manhattan, posted an online notice seeking a roommate recently, she listed her Upper East Side building's A.T.M. among its amenities. The A.T.M. is conveniently located between the elevators and the mailboxes, and Ms. Castroman said she often used it before heading to the subway. ''It comes in handy when I need to get money quickly,'' she said.</p>

        <p>AUTOMATED teller machines have become so common, it now seems there are almost as many places to get cash as to spend it. Convenience stores, nightclubs and office buildings are all well supplied with A.T.M.'s. In a few big cities, cash machines have even begun popping up in the lobbies of large apartment buildings.</p>
        <p>When Sue Castroman, a law librarian in Manhattan, posted an online notice seeking a roommate recently, she listed her Upper East Side building's A.T.M. among its amenities. The A.T.M. is conveniently located between the elevators and the mailboxes, and Ms. Castroman said she often used it before heading to the subway. ''It comes in handy when I need to get money quickly,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After a quarter-century in which they spread only slowly across the banking landscape, A.T.M.'s hit boom times in 1996, when networks like Cirrus and Plus began allowing operators of the machines to charge access fees.</p>
        <p>The number of A.T.M.'s in the United States has nearly doubled in the last five years to 324,000, driven partly by a steady drop in the price and size of the machines. One of the smallest models takes up less than 1.5 square feet and costs less than $6,000, meaning that it can turn a profit with as few as 150 transactions a month. (It can be bolted to a countertop to deter shoplifters.)</p>
        <p>In apartment buildings, where less foot traffic means that the machines are likely to get less use, A.T.M.'s are more about offering a service than they are about revenue, said Charlie Samons, vice president for sales and marketing at Access To Money, an A.T.M. distributor in New Jersey. ''They're not money-makers by any stretch of the imagination,'' but tenants do appreciate them, Mr. Samons said. Some building owners even choose to sacrifice commissions to keep fees low for tenants, he said.</p>
        <p>Kevin P. Singleton, senior vice president of the Rockrose Development Corporation, said that his company had put A.T.M.'s in the lobbies of 8 of its 14 apartment buildings in New York and would soon install them in the rest. It is also including them in plans for new buildings like East Coast, a 3,000-unit apartment complex in Queens. ''We are offering an additional amenity to our tenants, who are a demanding clientele,'' Mr. Singleton said, adding that the machines were ''not a profit center.''</p>
        <p>There may be a limit to how far A.T.M.'s will go in penetrating residential life. Last Christmas, Mr. Samons's company offered a full-size, in-home A.T.M. for $20,000 through the F.A.O. Schwarz toy catalog. There were no takers.</p>
