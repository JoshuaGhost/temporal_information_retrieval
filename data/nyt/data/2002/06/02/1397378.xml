        <p>It was not surprising that many Americans took a greater interest in foreign affairs after the attacks on the United States last September. But what does surprise foreign policy experts is that an eagerness to comprehend the world remains high nearly nine months later.</p>
        <p>Several leading foreign policy organizations say their Web sites are getting several million hits a month, up substantially from the period before Sept. 11, and polling organizations say they are finding strong support for greater international cooperation on major issues.</p>
        <p>''People are still searching for some answers to some big questions,'' said Marshall Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, an independent organization with about 6,500 members. The council, with one-third of its members under 40 years old and its membership drawn from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, will publish a survey of American opinions on foreign affairs this summer.</p>
        <p>''We experienced a huge upsurge of interest in the first three months after 9/11,'' Mr. Bouton said, adding that hits on the council's Web site, www.globalchicago.org, shot up. ''We saw great attendance at our programs. In the last four or five months, we've seen a sustained level of interest when the discussion is framed very broadly and we have a speaker whom people recognize.''</p>
        <p>Interest in American foreign policy also rose in smaller world affairs councils around the country and in local chapters of the United Nations Association of the United States. ''Our chapters want us to get stuff up on our Web site right away,'' said William H. Luers, president of the national association. Its Web site is www.unausa.org.</p>
        <p>The Web sites of two other foreign affairs organizations are attracting many hits. A new site for the Council on Foreign Relations in New York devoted to information on terrorism, www.terrorismanswers.com, has been attracting half a million hits a month. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in Washington, was receiving 3 million hits a month on its Web site, www.ceip.org, in the first months after Sept. 11. It now now gets about 2.5 million, still higher than before the September attacks.</p>
        <p>Steven Kull, who is director of the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and conducts regular public opinion surveys on America's role in the world, said he thought the attacks greatly reduced whatever true isolationism was left in the United States.</p>
        <p>Since 1945, he said, the program's polls have asked, ''Should the United States take an active role in world affairs or stay out of world affairs?''</p>
        <p>''In the last few decades,'' Mr. Kull said, ''it's been bumping up and down in the 60 percent range saying we should take an active part. After Sept. 11, that shot up to 81 percent, which is the highest ever recorded.''</p>
