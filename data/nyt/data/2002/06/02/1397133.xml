        <p>A SHORT circuit in an electric cable under Long Island Sound will bring Nassau and Suffolk to the brink of power blackouts this summer unless emergency repairs beat the heat, officials of the Long Island Power Authority said last week.</p>
        <p>And even if repairs can be made quickly, they said, nearly every other available source of electricity will have to work optimally for the lights to stay on during prolonged summer hot spells.</p>
        <p>''Things are certainly going to be very tight,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, sounding a warning that has been repeated every summer lately despite a variety of measures taken or proposed to meet the Island's growing demand for electricity.</p>
        <p>Repair crews were scrambling last week to assess damage in a section of the cable buried beneath the Sound between Pea Island and Davids Island near New Rochelle in Westchester, where the short occurred on May 18. The cable, called the Y-50 Cable, has been shut down since then.</p>
        <p>Depending on what crews find after they un-splice the damaged section and haul it out through a manhole on Davids Island, repairs or replacement could take as little as a month -- or until well after summer has passed.</p>
        <p>A loss of the 400 megawatts it can bring to the Island -- enough to supply 400,000 homes in times of normal usage -- nearly wipes out LIPA's margin of safety for demand that could top 5,000 megawatts for the first time this summer.</p>
        <p>In a severe heat spell, LIPA said last week, it might have to deliver more than 5,200 megawatts. Without the Y-50 cable, maximum supply from on-Island plants and imports drops to 5,517 megawatts, only about 300 megawatts more than demand.</p>
        <p>The margin does not take into account the effects of voluntary and mandatory power reductions that could shave demand. But it also assumes no major power failure in the five aging KeySpan power plants that account for most of Long Island generation. The estimate also assumes that 10 new small turbines, able to generate a total of 400 megawatts and being built on an expedited schedule at various locations, and the new 330-megawatt Trans√ânergie cross-Sound cable from New Haven to Shoreham will be in service within weeks.</p>
        <p>Last week, a specially equipped vessel finished digging a trench in the Sound floor for the new cable. LIPA said the line would be in service by the end of June.</p>
        <p>But only 2 of the 10 small turbines -- 79-megawatt KeySpan units at Port Jefferson and Glenwood Landing -- are installed and ready to operate. Bert J. Cunningham, the LIPA spokesman, said delays in some units might add to summer supply problems.</p>
        <p>Slicing the margin even thinner, a transformer malfunction at an East Garden City substation connected to a separate 600-megawatt cable running from Westchester would mean a reduction to 444 megawatts until repairs are completed over the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said LIPA was making contingency plans for 10 small diesel-powered generators mounted on flatbed trucks to provide about 200 megawatts in a power emergency. They would be on standby at substations by July but would only be used as a last resort.</p>
        <p>Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel in Bridgehampton, a consumer watchdog group on energy issues, said LIPA's problems reflected a lack of planning. ''They need a comprehensive plan instead of putting out fires constantly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said the unexpected Y-50 cable breakdown underscored the need for new power generators on Long Island. ''Obviously we are taking a hard look at some of the projects on the drawing board,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In an apparent policy shift, Mr. Kessel suggested that LIPA was now willing to negotiate with American National Power, a private power company that is proposing a 580-megawatt, natural-gas powered generator in Yaphank, over the costs of tying the plant into LIPA's transmission system.</p>
        <p>LIPA had previously opposed the plant because of tie-in and related costs it said would cost customers $100 million to $150 million. The company maintains the cost would be closer to $10 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said last week that discussions that could resolve the impasse had begun. ''We are talking, and I think that's important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Christopher Holmes, a vice president for American National Power in Marlborough, Mass., confirmed that there had been discussions on interconnection costs, though he said they were ''at a fairly early stage.'' The company said it hoped for approval for the Yaphank plant from a state siting board by August. Construction would take two years and could begin by winter, the British-owned company said.</p>
