        <p>Tapas, the tasty small dishes traditionally served with sherries and other wines at Spanish bars, are a good light meal in warm weather.</p>
        <p>Ñ TAPAS BAR  (212) 219-8856; 33 Crosby Street (near Broome Street); $; $25 and Under: 2/21/97.</p>
        <p>This small but stylish spot is one of New York's best places to taste sherries from the Andalusia region of southern Spain. A delicate, flavorful manzanilla paired with boquerones, anchovies that taste like pickled herring, is a classic combination.</p>

        <p>Tapas, the tasty small dishes traditionally served with sherries and other wines at Spanish bars, are a good light meal in warm weather.</p>
        <p>Ñ TAPAS BAR  (212) 219-8856; 33 Crosby Street (near Broome Street); $; $25 and Under: 2/21/97.</p>
        <p>This small but stylish spot is one of New York's best places to taste sherries from the Andalusia region of southern Spain. A delicate, flavorful manzanilla paired with boquerones, anchovies that taste like pickled herring, is a classic combination.</p>
        <p>LA PAELLA  (212) 598-4321; 214 East Ninth Street (near Third Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 10/20/95.</p>
        <p>Dim, crowded, smoky and loud with flamenco guitar, La Paella looks like an American fantasy of a little Spanish tapas bar. About 20 selections -- sort of an introduction to tapas -- are available each day. Almost all are very good. The paellas are rich, full of flavor and enormous.</p>
        <p>SABOR  (212) 579-2929; 462 Amsterdam Avenue (near 82nd Street); $; $25 and Under: 3/14/01.</p>
        <p>The large Pan-Latin menu here includes delightful tapas, like airy little smoked chicken croquettes with aioli, and a crisp lobster quesadilla topped with guacamole. The small wine list includes some good inexpensive choices.</p>
        <p>SOLERA  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 644-1166; 216 East 53rd Street (between Second and Third Avenues); $$$; Review: 4/8/98.</p>
        <p>As warm and rustic as an inn in Spain, Solera has a long room with terra-cotta tiles and romantic lighting. It is hard to resist the display of tapas by the bar like white beans tossed with chorizo and garlic shrimp in sherry vinegar.</p>
        <p>TAPERIA MADRID  (212) 794-2923; 1471 Second Avenue (near 77th Street); $; $25 and Under: 8/4/99.</p>
        <p>As credible a tapas bar as is likely on the Upper East Side, Taperia Madrid is a bar first, with noise, smoke, a lack of creature comforts and a casual attitude that is winning.</p>
        <p>TINTO  (718) 243-2010; 60 Henry Street (Cranberry Street), Brooklyn Heights; $; $25 and Under: 2/21/01.</p>
        <p>Tinto's inviting bar and dining room are full of wood from an old upstate barn. The menu changes nightly and includes excellent hot and cold tapas. Tinto appreciates the natural affinity of dry fino sherry and tapas, and takes care to serve its sherries fresh and chilled.</p>
        <p>XUNTA  (212) 614-0620; 174 First Avenue (near 11th Street); $; $25 and Under: 2/21/97.</p>
        <p>Xunta (pronounced SHOON-tuh) has the authentic feeling of a Spanish tapas bar. It's informal, crowded, smoky and loud, with dozens of tapas. The selection of Spanish sherries and other wines is just right.</p>
        <p>Summaries taken from reviews use the star ratings. Others are taken from the $25 and Under column (+) and articles (++), and capsule revies from New York Today: www.nytoday.com (+++).</p>
        <p>What the Stars Mean</p>
        <p>**** -- Extraordinary  *** -- Excellent  ** -- Very Good  * -- Good  None Poor to Satisfactory</p>
        <p>Price Range  Based on the cost of a three-course dinner, per person, tax, tip and drinks not included.</p>
        <p>$ -- $25 and under  $$ -- $25 to $40  $$$ -- $40 to $55  $$$$ -- $55 and over</p>
        <p>Past Reviews -- Good Eating columns back to June 1998, along with reviews from The Times and capsule reviews by Times critics of additional restaurants not reviewed in the newspaper, are available on New York Today.</p>
