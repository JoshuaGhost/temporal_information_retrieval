        <p>BARGE BARGAINS -- From July 21 to Aug. 17, French Country Waterways is taking up to $400 a person off the price of six-night barge cruises in Burgundy, the Upper Loire and Alsace-Lorraine. The barges hold 8 to 18 passengers, and the fares include all meals, wines, sightseeing trips, use of bikes, transfers between Paris or Strasbourg and the cruises, and one meal in a Michelin multiple-star restaurant. Rates start at $3,195 to $4,195 a person, based on double occupancy, depending on the barge; (800) 222-1236 or www.fcwl.com.</p>
        <p>SAVE SOME ESCAROLE -- Tuscan Way, based in Coconut Grove, Fla., is taking 20 percent off its four-  and seven-day cooking-instruction tours in southern Tuscany on June 29 and July 6. Classes have no more than 10 students, who stay in a country estate or the 900-year-old Casa Innocenti, in or near the village of Arcidosso. Rates include all meals, lessons by local cooks, wine tastings, market excursions and airport transfers. With the discount, the four-day program is $992 a person, double occupancy; one week is $1,752 to $1,832 a person, double; (800) 766-2390 or www.tuscanway.com.</p>

Tickets must be bought by July 31, booked at least a week ahead and paid for when booking. A Saturday-night stay-over is required; taxes and fees add about $90. Other restrictions apply. These fares can be booked only at www.britain2002.org.</p>
        <p>NORTHERN WATERS -- Usually, cruises to Norway and the Baltic get cheaper as the daily dose of sunlight dwindles. But Fred Olsen Cruise Lines is taking 40 percent off its Northern Europe cruises through July on the Braemar (729 passengers) and Black Watch (761). Cruises leave from Dover, England, and range from 8 to 17 nights. The eight-night cruises (to Amsterdam, Bergen and through fjords) start at $1,053 a person, based on double occupancy. Cruises of 13 nights, with stops including Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm, start at $1,707 a person, double. Air fare extra; (800) 843-0602 or www.fredolsencruises.co.uk.</p>
