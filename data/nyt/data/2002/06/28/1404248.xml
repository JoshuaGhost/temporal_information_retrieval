        <p>A man convicted last week of murder in connection with a triple homicide in an apartment above the Carnegie Deli was indicted yesterday on charges that he assaulted a Riker's Island guard. The man, Sean Salley, 30, is accused of punching Officer Vincent Donovan on May 21, officials said. Officer Donovan fell backward and banged his head on a jail cell's bars, the authorities said. He needed eight staples for the head wound he suffered when he fell. Mr. Salley said he acted in self-defense. He would face up to seven years in prison if convicted on the assault charge. He already faces 25 years to life in prison for each of the three counts of his murder conviction. His murder sentencing is scheduled for July 29.</p>
