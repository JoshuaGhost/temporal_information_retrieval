        <p>The Celerity Group, a company based in Milpitas, Calif., that makes devices used to manufacture computer chips, filed for an initial public offering yesterday that is expected to raise as much as $300 million. Celerity is a unit of the Kinetics Group, a Silicon Valley concern that focuses on the semiconductor and biopharmaceutical industries. Proceeds from the initial public offering will be used to repay about $170 million in outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes, which could include working capital and acquisitions. According to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Celerity makes the gas- and chemical-delivery process modules used to manufacture semiconductors. The number and price of common shares for sale were not set in yesterday's registration statement. Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley will lead the underwriting of the offering, with assistance from Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and UBS Warburg. The company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock market under the symbol CLRT.</p>
