        <p>Suffolk County legislators approved a resolution last week that would extend their terms of office from two years to four. The measure, which passed by a vote of 10 to 8, now goes to Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive. A spokeswoman, Cecilia M. Clausing, said Mr. Gaffney was reviewing it and had not taken a position. The votes of two-thirds of the 18 legislators would be needed to override a veto.</p>
        <p>The term extension will also need the approval of Suffolk voters in a referendum in November. The new system would take effect in November 2003.</p>

        <p>Suffolk County legislators approved a resolution last week that would extend their terms of office from two years to four. The measure, which passed by a vote of 10 to 8, now goes to Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive. A spokeswoman, Cecilia M. Clausing, said Mr. Gaffney was reviewing it and had not taken a position. The votes of two-thirds of the 18 legislators would be needed to override a veto.</p>
        <p>The term extension will also need the approval of Suffolk voters in a referendum in November. The new system would take effect in November 2003.</p>
        <p>The sponsor of the measure, Jon Cooper, Democrat of Lloyd Harbor, said longer terms would free legislators from the cost and time involved in running for re-election every two years. The longer term would also give legislators more time to study and address complex issues, he said. ''With a four-year term, legislators are free to implement policies that will benefit communities, rather than just putting a temporary patch on the problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Bishop of West Babylon, the Democratic minority leader, said he opposed the measure. ''Mr. Cooper has the best of intentions,'' he said, ''but I think they are outweighed by the fact that government would move further away from the people.''</p>
        <p>The county legislators earn $71,381 a year. The presiding officer, whom they elect, earns $87,243, and the deputy presiding officer earns $79,312.</p>
        <p>The 19 members of the Nassau County Legislature serve two-year terms. Fran Evans, a spokeswoman for the Democratic majority there, said that no measure to extend the terms had been proposed.</p>
