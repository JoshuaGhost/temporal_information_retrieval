        <p>STEBMAN-Betty J. The staff and board of the Natural Resources Defense Council mourn the passing of a wise guide and loyal friend. Betty was our fundraising advisor in the early days of NRDC and working with Harold Oram and Associates put NRDC on the path which allowed us to grow and prosper. We were just one of the fine organizations which Betty energetically and wisely incubated. We extend our sympathy to her 17 nieces and nephews, her 55 grand-nieces and nephews and thank the family for establishing the Betty Stebman Memorial Fund at NRDC, 40 West 20th St, New York, NY 10011. Frederick A.O. Schwarz, Jr. Chairman John H. Adams, President Frances G. Beinecke, Excecutive Director</p>
