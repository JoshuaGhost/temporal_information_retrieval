        <p>Fire Island Assn president Gerard Stoddard on June 23 article on Fire Island erosion holds National Park Service should require beach nourishment to simulate natural conditions</p>

        <p>The National Park Service spokesman, David Barna, says recent court decisions have forced park superintendents to be more aggressive to assure nothing is done to degrade the Fire Island National Seashore's natural state. Sound logical? Not when you consider that Fire Island is about as far from ''natural'' as it is possible for a barrier island to be. Stabilized inlets at each end have completely disrupted the natural alongshore drift of sand that provided wide, protective beaches for millennia.</p>
        <p>If the Park Service wanted to be logical, it would require beach nourishment on the island to simulate natural conditions. One would think its dismal record of trying to improve on nature in our national forests would have convinced the Department of the Interior that it is best to mimic nature, not pick and choose the natural conditions it wants to foster.</p>

        <p>Superintendent Constantine Dillon says he wants ''to protect natural systems'' while property owners want to protect property. But the same thing that protects Fire Island as a whole also protects property: a wide beach.</p>
        <p>Human intervention at the inlets and at the abortive Westhampton groin field has prevented natural beach building at Fire Island by blocking sand. It makes sense for man to recreate the natural conditions Mr. Dillon says he wants. But the Park Service is saying that if a wide, natural beach (albeit man-made) protects homes as well as the island itself, they don't want it. Your tax dollars at work.</p>
