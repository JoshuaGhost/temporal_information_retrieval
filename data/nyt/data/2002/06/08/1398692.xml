        <p>A unique triple almost materialized in the last three weeks. It began when Glenn Milgrim was a member of the team that captured the New York Grand National Teams title, earning the right to go to Washington next month for national playoffs. A week ago he won the Reisinger Knockout. In between, he entered for the Goldman Pairs with a different partner, Michael Polowan.</p>
        <p>They finished ahead of all the established tournament players, but lost the title narrowly to two unknowns, Boris Merson and Charles Moy. So Milgrim's triple escaped him, and such an opportunity may never come again.</p>

        <p>A unique triple almost materialized in the last three weeks. It began when Glenn Milgrim was a member of the team that captured the New York Grand National Teams title, earning the right to go to Washington next month for national playoffs. A week ago he won the Reisinger Knockout. In between, he entered for the Goldman Pairs with a different partner, Michael Polowan.</p>
        <p>They finished ahead of all the established tournament players, but lost the title narrowly to two unknowns, Boris Merson and Charles Moy. So Milgrim's triple escaped him, and such an opportunity may never come again.</p>
        <p>In the Reisinger final, Lilienstein and Milgrim, as North and South, had a bidding problem on the diagramed deal. After a weak two-diamond opening, North had to choose between two spades, three spades and a takeout double.</p>
        <p>He selected the double, and the response was a Lebensohl two no-trump. This asked for a three-club response, but North rebid three spades to show extra values. The four-four heart fit got away, and Milgrim had to struggle in three no-trump when four hearts would have been easy.</p>
        <p>The opening diamond lead was won with dummy's ace, and the club nine was led to the jack. South cashed the club ace and shifted to a heart, on which the jack was played. The king won in dummy, and the nine followed.</p>
        <p>This was a careful move, with three purposes: it would establish the suit if West had begun with a doubleton ace; if not, it would cut the defenders's communications; and in some situations it would prepare for a fourth-round entry to the closed hand.</p>
        <p>West won with the heart ten and persevered with his diamonds. South took his king and cashed the club king, throwing the heart queen from dummy. The position was then this:</p>
        <p>The club ten was led, and the remaining heart was thrown from the dummy. East took his queen and led a spade (a club would have been no improvement). South won with dummy's ten, cashed the ace and continued the suit.</p>
        <p>East scored two spade tricks, but the club seven came back to life at the finish, winning over East's six to give Milgrim his game. He expected to lose 2 imps, with four hearts making an overtrick in the replay, but he won 12. The opposing North-South went totally off the rails, playing six no-trump and going down five.</p>
