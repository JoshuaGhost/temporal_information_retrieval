        <p>Loren Roberts can't win the United States Open this year, but he is a threat to win the Buick Classic.</p>
        <p>Disappointed that he failed to qualify for the Open next week at Bethpage State Park's Black Course on Long Island, Roberts came to Westchester Country Club today needing something to feel good about.</p>
        <p>It did not take long. Roberts displayed one of golf's best putting strokes, making nine birdies over his last 14 holes on one of the PGA Tour's more challenging layouts. When the putting clinic ended, Roberts had shot a seven-under-par 64, good enough for a one-stroke lead over three players tied for second place -- Bob Heintz, Jerry Kelly and Michael Muehr -- heading into Friday's second round.</p>
        <p>Nicknamed the Boss of the Moss for his pure putting stroke, Roberts has won seven times on the Tour during a professional career that started in 1983. But Roberts will turn 47 this month, and he admitted that the challenge of keeping up with today's long-hitting youngsters has begun to wear on him.</p>
        <p>''It's getting a little tougher for me physically to do some of the things I need to be competitive on longer golf courses,'' said Roberts, who last won on the Tour at the 2000 Greater Milwaukee Open. ''I've never been that long of a hitter, and I'm having to continually work on my flexibility to play with these 20-something guys.''</p>
        <p>But today, Roberts set the pace with his putting, which was exceptional even for him. Teeing off on the back nine, Roberts made birdie putts of 8 feet at No. 14, 17 feet at No. 15, 5 feet at No. 18, 8 feet at No. 1, 7 feet at No. 3 and 15 feet at No. 4, plus a two-putt birdie from 50 feet at the par-5 No. 5.</p>
        <p>The catalyst for Roberts's round was a 65-foot chip-in for birdie with a sand wedge at No. 17 that moved him to one-under par after a sluggish start that included two bogeys over his first seven holes. From that point, Roberts made six birdies without a bogey, proving again that one shot can change a round's momentum.</p>
        <p>''I had an impossible chip-in and made a lot of long putts,'' Roberts said. ''I just got on a roll today.''</p>
        <p>Playing well at Westchester is nothing new for Roberts, who has five top 10 finishes here, including in 1999, when he tied for fifth. Roberts loves the variety of shots required at Westchester, where power is not the overriding factor.</p>
        <p>''Quite honestly, I don't think we play enough golf courses like this anymore, old and classic,'' Roberts said. ''There are probably holes out here that guys would complain about if they were designed now.</p>
        <p>''I like the nuances of this course. It's pleasing to the eye, and it has some quirkiness. It's a great test of golf. Every player in the field has a chance. It's not just stand up there and rip. You've got a great mix of long holes, a great mix of short holes, and you have to hit every shot in the bag -- low shots, high shots, bump and runs, you have to hit them all. I don't see too many golf courses being built like this anymore. I have a good attitude about the golf course, and that's one reason I play good here.''</p>
        <p>Roberts's last chance to make the United States Open field was at a qualifier earlier this week, but he fell three strokes shy of getting into a playoff for the last spot. It will be only the second time that Roberts has missed the Open since 1993.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry I'm not going to be in,'' said Roberts, a native of California who now lives in Germantown, Tenn. ''I'm going to go home next week and be at home for a couple of weeks.''</p>
        <p>Winning this weekend would make the trip home far more enjoyable. When you can putt as Roberts did today, winning is a realistic possibility.</p>
        <p>''I just happened to have a great day with the putter,'' Roberts said. ''I'm here, so I'm going to try and win the golf tournament.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>SERGIO GARC√çA, the defending champion, managed to shoot 68 despite a stomach virus that kept him in bed Wednesday. ''My arms felt a little shaky early in the round, but I'm pleased with how I did,'' he said. . . . There were three holes in one Thursday. STEVE ALLAN and ANGEL CABRERA aced the 149-yard No. 6 with 9-irons, while LARRY MIZE used a 3-iron for his hole in one at the 223-yard No. 16. . . . RETIEF GOOSEN, the defending United States Open champion, shot a 67, ERNIE ELS and JIM FURYK shot 68's, PHIL MICKELSON shot a 69 and DAVID TOMS shot a 70. DAVID DUVAL struggled to a 72, while VIJAY SINGH's 74 included five bogeys and a double bogey.</p>
