        <p>Royal Philips Electronics said yesterday that it had filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission against 19 companies that make blank compact discs, or distribute them, in an effort to curb imports of unlicensed discs. Philips, which is Europe's largest electronics company, said it sought to keep companies from infringing its patents on recordable and rewritable compact disc technology by selling the discs in the United States without a license. Officials for Philips said the company asked the commission to issue an order ''excluding importation of all unlicensed discs into the United States.''</p>
