        <p>Through it all, the dizzying ups and downs, Ken McPeek kept his composure, a remarkable accomplishment in itself. For three months, he could not seem to lose a major race. For the nine weeks before yesterday's Belmont Stakes, he had to be wondering just what fate had against him. There was an injured star, a broken leg sustained in a pickup basketball game before the Kentucky Derby, a beaten favorite in the Derby and an unsatisfied owner who gave him a pink slip.</p>
        <p>Amid it all, there was no grumbling, no whining, just a desire to move forward. ''You have to be resilient to play this game, that's for sure,'' McPeek said.</p>

        <p>Through it all, the dizzying ups and downs, Ken McPeek kept his composure, a remarkable accomplishment in itself. For three months, he could not seem to lose a major race. For the nine weeks before yesterday's Belmont Stakes, he had to be wondering just what fate had against him. There was an injured star, a broken leg sustained in a pickup basketball game before the Kentucky Derby, a beaten favorite in the Derby and an unsatisfied owner who gave him a pink slip.</p>
        <p>Amid it all, there was no grumbling, no whining, just a desire to move forward. ''You have to be resilient to play this game, that's for sure,'' McPeek said.</p>
        <p>On the most unlikely occasion, a trainer who has been through just about everything bounced back, ending a tough skid with a victory by Sarava in the Belmont Stakes. For McPeek, resilience is starting to become a way of life.</p>
        <p>Long before he was the golden boy of the Kentucky Derby prep season, McPeek battled through more than his share of problems. He was involved in a nasty dispute with the New Jersey Racing Commission, which alleged that he knowingly ran an unfit horse that broke down in a race at the Meadowlands. He was later exonerated. Before that, his luck was going so bad on the racetrack that he was down to one horse. And, worst of all, his wife, Sue, learned that she had a rare form of cancer in 2000.</p>
        <p>His wife recovered and McPeek's training career began to soar. Long before anyone had heard of Sarava, McPeek won the Louisiana Derby with Repent and the Florida Derby and Blue Grass with Harlan's Holiday. But Repent was sidelined with an ankle problem after finishing second behind War Emblem in the Illinois Derby and Harlan's Holiday was a major disappointment in the first two legs of the Triple Crown. He was seventh as the favorite in the Derby and fourth in the Preakness.</p>
        <p>Apparently, that did not sit well with his owner, Jack Wolf. Last Wednesday, he fired McPeek and turned Harlan's Holiday over to the trainer Todd Pletcher.</p>
        <p>''It's been pretty insane,'' McPeek said yesterday. ''I had the favorite most of the winter for the Derby in Repent and then had the race-day favorite in Harlan's Holiday and now I won the Belmont with a horse who was 20 stalls down from those guys. This is awesome.''</p>
        <p>Sue McPeek said: ''It's been a very up year for us. Kenny and I learned that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything. If I had my choice between having my health and Harlan's Holiday, well, there's no question I'd rather have my health.</p>
        <p>''Right now, I'm so happy for Kenny. He stuck by me through some difficult times. If anybody deserved this, it's him. He deserves to be a part of history.''</p>
        <p>A talented trainer, McPeek figured to win a Triple Crown race sooner or later, but no one could have expected it would come with Sarava. The longest-priced horse to win the Belmont Stakes, he had won just two starts in the United States since his arrival from England. Before the Belmont, his biggest victory had come in the $79,000 Sir Barton Stakes, which seemed like a meaningless event on the Preakness undercard. Some wondered why McPeek brought him to the Belmont.</p>
        <p>''I'm not overly surprised that this horse won,'' he said. ''Timing is everything with these horses. There was no doubt that he'd get the mile and a half. I just didn't know how good he was. But you've got to throw them in the ring sometimes to find out.''</p>
        <p>So that's what McPeek did. He took a shot. Everything else had failed this Triple Crown season and an owner had given up on him. There was nothing else to do but take a step back and reload.</p>
        <p>Jack Wolf was watching yesterday from among the huge crowd at Belmont, like so many others there to witness Triple Crown history. After it was over, no doubt he was as stunned as everyone else. But perhaps he learned a lesson. Giving up on Ken McPeek is not a good idea.</p>
