        <p>EVEN a seasoned real estate professional like Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand Realty, recently lost out in a bidding war on a home he wanted to purchase for his own family. Like many other buyers in today's residential real estate market, Mr. Rand was trumped by a higher bidder, despite the fact that his $695,000 offer on a three-bedroom Tudor in White Plains was $20,000 more than the asking price.</p>
        <p>As has been the case in Westchester's housing market for several years now, sellers have the upper hand, and buyers have to move quickly, bid high and often forgo mortgage contingencies and other buyer protections when the home of their dreams comes on the market. In fact, Susan Freedman, a White Plains lawyer who represents buyers and sellers, advises clients who are purchasing homes to avoid special requests when possible. ''In today's market, the seller might just call out, 'Next!' '' she said. ''More often than not, they have six customers waiting behind you.''</p>

        <p>EVEN a seasoned real estate professional like Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand Realty, recently lost out in a bidding war on a home he wanted to purchase for his own family. Like many other buyers in today's residential real estate market, Mr. Rand was trumped by a higher bidder, despite the fact that his $695,000 offer on a three-bedroom Tudor in White Plains was $20,000 more than the asking price.</p>
        <p>As has been the case in Westchester's housing market for several years now, sellers have the upper hand, and buyers have to move quickly, bid high and often forgo mortgage contingencies and other buyer protections when the home of their dreams comes on the market. In fact, Susan Freedman, a White Plains lawyer who represents buyers and sellers, advises clients who are purchasing homes to avoid special requests when possible. ''In today's market, the seller might just call out, 'Next!' '' she said. ''More often than not, they have six customers waiting behind you.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Rand, whose firm has offices in four counties, lost a second home he wanted to buy -- a four-bedroom Cape Cod on which he bid $50,000 over the asking price of $625,000 -- he tried another tactic on a four-bedroom colonial.</p>
        <p>This time, he arrived at the front door with his infant daughter, Diana, in his arms and offered $845,000, which was the asking price. The seller agreed to it.</p>
        <p>Did the baby make a difference? Mr. Rand said that although he did not know for sure, ''many buyers like to see that a happy little family is moving in to the house they love.''</p>
        <p>''My advice to prospective buyers,'' he said, ''is to make a good impression on the seller. Wear a tie, comb your hair and look like you really want that house.''</p>
        <p>Recent numbers from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a subsidiary of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Putnam County Association of Realtors, confirm what buyers and brokers are experiencing -- that with supply low and demand high, if ever there was a seller's market, this is it.</p>
        <p>''There remains the important local limiting factor of low inventory, which although improved in relation to last year is still inadequate for meeting current levels of demand,'' the report said.,</p>
        <p>There were 2,393 single-family homes on the market during the first quarter of this year, more than 17 percent above the total of a year earlier, 2,036, and almost 21 percent more than the 1,980 homes on the market during the first quarter of 2000. The total inventory for single-family homes, condo, co-ops, and two- to five-family homes was also sharply higher, 3,856 at the end of the first quarter for Westchester, compared with 3,184 a year ago and 3,288 at the end of the first quarter of 2000.</p>
        <p>But despite the improvement over the previous two years, the totals are far less than the inventories of 8,000 or more units that prevailed in 1997 and prior years, the report said.</p>
        <p>With buyers competing for a limited number of homes, the median price of a single-family home in Westchester, $469,100, was 14 percent higher in the first quarter 2002 than a year earlier. The median price is just short of the record of $475,000 set in the third quarter of last year, according to the report issued at the end of April by the Multiple Listing Service.</p>
        <p>Real estate agents say the trends documented by the listing service in the first quarter appear to be influencing sales and prices so far in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>''We continue to have highly qualified buyers ready, willing and financially able to buy, even at those prices,'' said Donna M. Tierney, the immediate past president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the managing broker of Holmes &amp; Kennedy in Armonk. ''But buyers better move quickly and have all their financial approvals ready. If they sit and think about things too long, they'll lose out.''</p>
        <p>W HEN we urge buyers to bid quickly, we're not doing it just to make a sale,'' she said. ''We're trying to help them succeed. But they also have to remember that in this market, whatever they do, they may still lose one or two or three houses before they succeed.''</p>
        <p>Jamie Troia is typical of the new breed of buyer that is ready and financially able to buy. But so far, he and his wife, Danielle, have been unable to clinch a deal. Mr. Troia, a manager for a mortgage banking firm in Montvale, N.J., and his wife, an accountant for I.B.M. in Somers, are living in an apartment in a two-family house in White Plains.</p>
        <p>With a new baby daughter, Jacqueline, small quarters and no washer or dryer on the premises, they are eager to move.</p>
        <p>''We started looking for a home more than a year ago, but then took a few months off to see if the market and the prices would ease a little,'' Mr. Troia said.</p>
        <p>''When nothing changed, we entered the market again and bid the asking price, $375,000, on an adorable little Cape Cod in Valhalla in move-in condition,'' he said. ''But evidently we didn't move fast enough, because someone else got there first.''</p>
        <p>Then came a three-bedroom colonial that needed work. The owner was asking $435,000, and even though Mr. and Mrs. Troia and their real estate agent thought the house was worth only $420,000, they decided to offer the asking price. Again they lost; the house sold for more than $480,000.</p>
        <p>''The seller told us he really liked us and that he thought the house would be great for us, especially since Danielle was pregnant,'' Mr. Troia said. ''But the bottom line was that he got a better offer from someone else.''</p>
        <p>Now the couple is waiting to hear whether their $380,000 bid on a three-bedroom colonial in White Plains, for which the owner is asking $369,000, will be accepted.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes we wonder whether we'll ever get a house we want,'' Mr. Troia said.</p>
        <p>Some real estate agents predicted that with mortgage rates still low but expected to go up soon, and house prices high, the heated demand might ease somewhat in the coming months.</p>
        <p>''Some people who have been on the fence are finally deciding to sell,'' said Mark Seiden, an associate broker for Coldwell Banker in Briarcliff.</p>
        <p>Still, as fast as a property comes on the market, it is snapped up, Mr. Seiden said, with buyers making previously unheard-of concessions to the seller.</p>
        <p>He cited, as an example, a three-bedroom contemporary home with river views that he is showing in the hamlet of Scarborough in Briarcliff Manor. The seller is asking $829,222. Two buyers have bid more than the asking price, he said. Both have waived the mortgage contingency, and both are willing to let the seller stay in the house after the closing and until the end of November for no rent.</p>
        <p>When buyers waive the mortgage contingency, it means that even if they fail to get a mortgage or if the house is appraised at less than the purchase price, they are obligated to go forward with the purchase. ''At the very least,'' said Ms. Freedman, the lawyer, ''they stand to lose their down payment.''</p>
        <p>More worrisome, she said, is that eager buyers often waive an engineering report. ''They're buying blind,'' Ms. Freedman said, ''because the house may need a new roof or a boiler, and the new owner doesn't learn that until after he already owns the home.''</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the lack of inventory, there were 1,814 residential sales in Westchester in the first quarter of 2002, up from 1,798 for the corresponding period in 2000 and 1,758 for the first quarter last year.</p>
        <p>While sales of single-family homes in the first quarter of 2002 were up 9 percent over the first quarter of last year, sales of condominiums and co-ops declined by 3 percent. The Multiple Listing Service report suggested that ''the resurgent single-family house market may have drawn some purchasers away from condos and co-ops.''</p>
        <p>Dollar volume of sales of single-family homes, condos, co-ops and multifamily homes in January through March rose to $829.48 million -- up $134.55 million, 19 percent, from the first quarter a year ago. Sales of single-family homes for the first quarter of this year were $678.49 million -- up $112.8 million or 20 percent from the corresponding period in 2001.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the Multiple Listing Service said the prospect was for ''a continued powerful demand'' for housing in Westchester, with continued high prices for homes, which might -- but might not -- put a brake on sales.</p>
