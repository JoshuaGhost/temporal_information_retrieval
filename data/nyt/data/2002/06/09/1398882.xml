        <p>WHEN I WAS</p>
        <p>A YOUNG MAN</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Bob Kerrey.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 270 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A James H. Silberman Book/</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $26.</p>
        <p>UP to a point, Bob Kerrey's life as a young man is thoroughly ordinary. He grows up in the middle class in the middle of America. He likes pretty girls and pretty cars. He plays high school football. He goes off to the state university. Respectably conservative, he casts his first presidential vote for Barry Goldwater and his second for Richard Nixon. Then, in a matter of minutes, about midnight on Feb. 25, 1969, in a village in Vietnam, everything changes. He is leading a Navy Seal team on a raid, hoping to capture or kill a Vietcong official. Something goes wrong. Weapons are fired, and at least 13 people are found dead. They turn out to be not enemy warriors but women and children.</p>
        <p>Kerrey's account of how that happened, though brief, is the turning point of this engrossing memoir. But the history of his early life, before Vietnam, is more than a narrative ploy to move the reader along to the disaster that changed the course of his life. Not that there was anything exotic about growing up in Lincoln, Neb., after World War II. His father prospered in the lumber and coal business. The family lived in a three-level house in a well-tended suburb. The most exciting event he remembers from adolescence is the day he saw a naked woman from the treehouse in his backyard.</p>
        <p>Young Bob was undersized and asthmatic. He yearned to be like his dashing and athletic older brother, but he lacked the natural ability. He played football, not as a star but as the kid who stayed on the team through hard work, long hours and stubbornness.</p>
        <p>Like many Americans of his time, he learned about heroes from the Bible on Sunday and cowboy movies on Saturday. As it happened, he also had a hero closer to home. Both his father and his father's brother, John, served in World War II. The father's service was short on adventure, but John's was not. He was taken prisoner in the Philippines early in the war, then simply disappeared. His family feared that he had died in a Japanese prison camp. He had not. He escaped and spent most of the rest of the war as a guerrilla with a band of Americans and Filipinos spying on the Japanese. Then, on his way to meet a submarine that would send him home, he disappeared. He might have drowned. His family never learned his fate. Just as Bob Kerrey yearned to be like his older brother growing up in Nebraska, he dreamed of emulating the heroism of his Uncle John in war.</p>
        <p>Kerrey's version of what happened at Thanh Phong, when the story broke a year ago, was that his memory was vague on details but that he believed his team was being fired on and they returned fire. The version of a teammate, Gerhard Klann, was much different. In an article by Gregory L. Vistica in The New York Times Magazine, Klann said that the team members feared that the civilians would tip off Vietcong guerrillas, who would ambush and kill the Americans before they could escape. So, he said, the team made a calculated decision to kill the civilians. Klann's account was corroborated by at least one Vietnamese survivor from the village.</p>
        <p>Americans debated the incident for weeks. Some sided with Kerrey and added that the nation should defend and honor the young Americans who were sent into a hellish, unwinnable war. Others condemned Kerrey as a murderer, said that he later exploited his war-hero status for political gain and demanded that he be tried as a war criminal.</p>
        <p>Kerrey himself adds only a few details in ''When I Was a Young Man.'' In fact, he had not spoken publicly of the event until he was approached by Vistica, and says that he agreed to talk about it then in part because he had begun writing about it. After the publicity, he and the six other men involved met ''for the first time since the war''; their discussion altered his memory. ''Thus,'' he writes, ''the story told in this book -- though the most important details remain the same -- is different than the one I first told, and even today I would not swear that my memory is 100 percent accurate. It is merely the best I can remember today.'' In more than one interview last year he expressed deep grief and guilt about the events at Thanh Phong. And in the book, he expresses embarrassment about being awarded the Medal of Honor for a second operation, on an island near Nha Trang, in which he was severely wounded and lost part of a leg. Much of the closing section is devoted to his struggle, mentally and physically, to recover his health. (The book ends before the beginning of his years as a Nebraska governor and senator. He is now president of the New School University.)</p>
        <p>But what Kerrey's account lacks in detail it makes up in context. Early in this bright innocent patriot's days in Vietnam -- he was there only two months -- he discovered that many of the Americans already there were disillusioned, that many were addicted to drugs and that large numbers believed the war to be hopeless. He was trained in some of the military's most demanding skills -- underwater demolition, sabotage, intelligence, parachuting into battle, first aid, jungle survival, killing -- but found that no one in authority had any firm ideas on what to do with him and his men. ''To say that I barely had a clue about what I would be doing in Vietnam understates the case,'' he writes.</p>
        <p>He received suggestions that they just run up and down the rivers in boats looking for places to ambush the enemy. He was to rely on military intelligence to guide him. It is a measure of the quality of that intelligence -- or perhaps of his luck -- that the first six ambushes he set were dry runs. Then, against the advice of his most experienced team member, he ordered the raid on Thanh Phong, thought to be controlled by the Vietcong. But he knew what that meant. Vietnamese villagers, he writes, tended to sympathize with the side they most feared. ''Either way they could lose. They risked having us destroy their villages if they cooperated with the Vietcong and having the Vietcong destroy their villages if they cooperated with us.''</p>
        <p>As Kerrey tells the story here, the Seal team slipped into Thanh Phong and quickly discovered that someone had tipped off the Vietcong who were supposed to be meeting there. Only women and children were in evidence. All the men were seemingly gone. Before he could decide whether to withdraw, Kerrey writes, ''someone shot at us from the direction of the women and children, trapping them in a crossfire. We returned a tremendous barrage of fire and began to withdraw.'' He saw women and children cut to pieces and he heard their cries. Afterward, he says, ''I felt a sickness in my heart for what we had done.''</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, Kerrey led the second operation. It had just begun when an explosion hurled him backward and separated his foot from his calf. He tied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and went on directing his men in the firefight. When it stopped, he jabbed a shot of morphine into his flesh and waited for the medics. Gerhard Klann, who would so harshly contradict him 30 years later, propped him in his arms and gave him a cigarette. Bob Kerrey's war was over.</p>
        <p>So was his innocence. He turned against America's involvement in Vietnam. Sometime in the future he would become a famous Democrat, but before then he had to watch President Richard Nixon, whom he had come to dislike intensely, pin the Medal of Honor on his chest. His father worried on the way to the White House that Bob would do something rash and ruin the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Not only did he feel he did not deserve the medal. Worse than that, he writes, he believed that his injury was punishment for his part in the killings at Thanh Phong. On his first night home in Nebraska, he says, he couldn't sleep because he kept hearing the cries of the women and children in the village. Clearly, he still hears them.</p>
