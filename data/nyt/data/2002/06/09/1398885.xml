        <p>Anthony Arnove letter on Fouad Ajami May 19 review of The Reckoning: Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein by Sandra Mackey (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Fouad Ajami is absolutely right when he notes in his review of Sandra Mackey's book ''The Reckoning'' (May 19) that the sanctions imposed on Iraq ''have made it easier'' for Saddam Hussein to survive. But he is mistaken to conclude that were the United States ''to pick up where we left off a decade ago and head to Baghdad, the tormented people of Iraq would be sure to erupt in joy.''</p>
        <p>Having traveled in Iraq and studied the sanctions, I think it is clear that the impact of the embargo has been borne by the civilian population and not by the government. As much as people in Iraq oppose Hussein, the United States government has been discredited by the sanctions, its continuing bombing in the no-fly zones and its past support for Hussein.</p>
        <p>Opposition groups in Iraq have refused American aid for fear of being associated with the United States government, which has an abysmal record in its dealings with Iraq and in particular with the Kurds. Meanwhile, the so-called opposition forces financed by the United States and largely based in London have no credibility inside the country. Also, Iraqis rightly fear that another ground invasion of Iraq will lead to more civilian suffering and the imposition of a leadership favorable to American interests, not to a genuine democracy.</p>
