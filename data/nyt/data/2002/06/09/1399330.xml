        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>My dad used to watch the Babe in his salad days. The Babe was the best right fielder of all time in his opinion as well as in Dave Anderson's (''Bonds, the Babe and the All-Time Hitters,'' May 12). Babe Ruth could run like a deer and had great catching ability, and given that he was a Hall of Fame pitcher, he may have been the best throwing outfielder of all time. Unfortunately, we only have films of the older, fat Babe. If you don't think he could run, look up his doubles and triples. The Babe was not much to admire as a man, but as an athlete he was No. 1.</p>

        <p>It is hard for me to understand Anderson's putting Johnny Bench on his list and not even including Mickey Cochran and Bill Dickey before him; both were better catchers and hitters than Bench.</p>
