      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by former Sens Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, leaders of president's Commission on National Security/21st Century, says US faces terrorist threat that is neither conventional war nor traditional crime, and that combating it requires new government structures, new policies and new thinking; says US government can and must reorganize itself in fight and must place agencies required to defend against terrorism under single statutory command; says creating Department of Homeland Security is not only necessary step, but one that should have been taken well before September 11 (M)</p>

        <p>America is now divided between those who think the worst is over -- and therefore we can resume business as usual -- and those who believe we are engaged in a new form of conflict. We are among those who believe we face a threat that is neither conventional war nor traditional crime, and that combating it requires new government structures, new policies and new thinking.</p>
        <p>The United States government can and must reorganize itself in this fight: the agencies required to defend America against terrorism are a hodgepodge that must be under a single statutory command. Creating a Department of Homeland Security, as President Bush proposes, is not only a necessary step, but one that should have been taken well before Sept. 11. Virtually all the pieces of the new department already exist; they need to be organized. And we have already determined to spend about $38 billion a year on homeland security. That money should be allocated through a single accountable official.</p>

        <p>America is now divided between those who think the worst is over -- and therefore we can resume business as usual -- and those who believe we are engaged in a new form of conflict. We are among those who believe we face a threat that is neither conventional war nor traditional crime, and that combating it requires new government structures, new policies and new thinking.</p>
        <p>The United States government can and must reorganize itself in this fight: the agencies required to defend America against terrorism are a hodgepodge that must be under a single statutory command. Creating a Department of Homeland Security, as President Bush proposes, is not only a necessary step, but one that should have been taken well before Sept. 11. Virtually all the pieces of the new department already exist; they need to be organized. And we have already determined to spend about $38 billion a year on homeland security. That money should be allocated through a single accountable official.</p>
        <p>Is this ''big government''? Yes, but sometimes effectiveness requires scale. And while bureaucrats within the existing agencies may be reluctant to share turf, can anyone seriously imagine the director of some office or the chairman of some Congressional committee arguing for personal political prerogatives when the security of 280 million Americans is at stake? It would be too embarrassing.</p>
        <p>The president is correct in not trying to give the new homeland security agency control over our intelligence agencies. Intelligence collection and analysis are one job; applying that intelligence to security operations is another. No one proposes that the C.I.A. be placed in the Defense Department.</p>
        <p>The elements of the new department have vastly different missions, from food inspection to immigration control. But these agencies have one very important thing in common -- their jobs changed fundamentally on Sept. 11, 2001. Their responsibility now is to ensure our domestic security first and then, after that, to carry out their traditional duties. Congress and the president might, in fact, find it more efficient to separate some traditional duties of these agencies -- like customs collections -- from the new homeland security mission of enforcing laws to stop terrorists. The unrelated duties could be left in their traditional agencies.</p>
        <p>After World War II, with advice from appointed commissions, Congress created a new set of agencies, including the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, to address the new threats of the emerging cold war. Following that model, from 1998 to 2001 the United States Commission on National Security/21st Century, which we led, undertook the most comprehensive assessment of national security in a half-century and warned of the terrorist threat as early as September 1999. On Jan. 31, 2001, after more than two years of hearings, briefings, seminars, travel and discussions with experts, the commission recommended that President Bush create a national homeland security agency.</p>
        <p>We saw this as necessary not only to defend against terrorism but also to satisfy one of the most important principles of democratic government: accountability, ultimately to the people. The president has identified a necessary step to reduce the hazards and to provide this accountability. Congress, supported by the American people, should move quickly to create the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
