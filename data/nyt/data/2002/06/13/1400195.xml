      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of the biotechnology company ImClone Systems, was arrested at his Manhattan home early yesterday morning and charged with insider stock trading.</p>
        <p>A federal criminal complaint accuses Dr. Waksal of tipping off family members to sell their ImClone shares in late December before the public announcement of an unfavorable regulatory ruling on the company's experimental cancer drug -- an announcement that sent the stock price plummeting when it was made.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waksal, as much a fixture in New York social circles as in the biotechnology industry, was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents at 6:30 a.m. at his spacious art-filled loft in the SoHo section of Manhattan. In addition to the criminal charges filed by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against him.</p>
        <p>''The crux of our case is that when bad news came to ImClone, Sam Waksal scrambled to protect himself and his relatives,'' said Barry W. Rashkover, the S.E.C. associate director in New York.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waksal was released on $10 million bond, of which half will have to be posted in cash by tomorrow. In a statement, his lawyers called the evidence against him ''entirely circumstantial,'' adding, ''The government misread the evidence, and it overreacted in deciding to make today's arrest.''</p>
        <p>The lawyers, Mark Pomerantz and Lewis Liman, said Dr. Waksal was ''an accomplished scientist and researcher who has spent most of his career in the successful search for drugs that have the potential to cure cancer.''</p>
        <p>The criminal complaint was the second filed in Manhattan this month against a prominent business executive. Last week, L. Dennis Kozlowski was indicted on charges of state sales tax evasion one day after he resigned as chief executive of Tyco International. Prosecutors and regulators have been bearing down on signs of corporate and executive misconduct in the wake of Enron's collapse and the bursting of the stock market bubble.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's complaints by the Justice Department and the S.E.C. say that when Dr. Waksal learned on Dec. 26 that the Food and Drug Administration was about to refuse to accept the company's application for approval of its cancer drug, Erbitux, he tipped off two family members in a series of late-night and early-morning phone calls. The relatives, identified by others as one of Dr. Waksal's daughters and his father, sold more than $10 million in ImClone stock during the next two days, before the news was announced after the stock market closed on Friday, Dec. 28.</p>
        <p>The complaints also say that Dr. Waksal tried to sell $4.9 million worth of shares but his brokers would not do it because of regulations restricting the sale of stock by corporate insiders. The criminal complaint also charges Dr. Waksal with perjury, saying he lied under oath to the S.E.C. when questioned in April about the transactions. If convicted, Dr. Waksal, 54, could face years in prison and millions of dollars in fines from the nine criminal counts against him.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C., meanwhile, wants him to pay unspecified fines and give back several million dollars in stock losses avoided by the people he tipped off. It would also bar him from serving as an officer or director of any public company.</p>
        <p>The charges open a new chapter in the colorful career of Dr. Waksal, an immunologist by training who until a few months ago was as likely to show up in the society gossip columns as in the business pages. Described by those who know him as extremely charming and well read, he has cultivated friendships with entertainers, politicians and other prominent people, like the style arbiter Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart has acknowledged selling all her ImClone shares the day before the announcement of the unfavorable regulatory ruling on the cancer drug, but has denied having any insider information, saying she had sold because the shares had dropped below her target price. Shares of ImClone closed at $55.25 on Dec. 28, before the company made its announcement. The next trading day, Monday, Dec. 31, as the public responded to the news, the shares fell to $46.46. ImClone's stock, which has been trading below $8 recently, rose 28 cents yesterday, to $7.83. Shares of Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, fell.</p>
        <p>News of Dr. Waksal's arrest reverberated through the biotechnology industry's annual convention , being held in Toronto. Biotechnology stocks are down sharply this year, in no small measure because the ImClone imbroglio has left investors wary of trusting company claims.</p>
        <p>''Sam's become the poster child for everything that's wrong with the industry,'' G. Steven Burrill of Burrill &amp; Company, a biotechnology investment firm, said in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Although an early-morning arrest is unusual in such cases, it had become clear recently that Dr. Waksal would face some sort of federal charges. He resigned from the company three weeks ago to try to distance ImClone from his problems. The company, the largest biotechnology concern based in New York City, is now run by his younger brother, Harlan W. Waksal, a medical doctor who had been its chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>Harlan Waksal is now coming under scrutiny in Washington by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been conducting its own investigation of ImClone.</p>
        <p>Ken Johnson, a committee spokesman, said Congressional investigators had determined that another ImClone official, Lily W. Lee, met with the F.D.A. on Dec. 4 and sent an internal memorandum indicating the agency might reject the company's application. Two days later Harlan Waksal sold $50 million of shares.</p>
        <p>A person close to the situation, however, said the memorandum was dated the day of the F.D.A. meeting but might not have been written until later. It did not give an indication that a rejection was likely, only that, under the law, it was one possibility, according to this person, who said Harlan Waksal had told ImClone's board weeks before that he would sell the shares to help pay taxes on earlier stock profits.</p>
        <p>The House committee has scheduled a hearing on ImClone today and Samuel Waksal, who has been subpoenaed, will appear. In a response to a request by the Justice Department, a magistrate in New York temporarily lifted a condition of Samuel Waksal's bail that he stay in the New York area.</p>
        <p>Samuel Waksal, who started ImClone in 1984, finally seemed on the verge of huge success late last year. The company's first drug, Erbitux, had seemed to show impressive results in treating colorectal cancer and Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay $2 billion for rights to Erbitux in the largest deal for a biotechnology product.</p>
        <p>Then, on Dec. 28, the F.D.A. formally notified ImClone that it would not even review its application to have the drug approved, saying the company's data was deficient. Bristol-Myers Squibb said that the arrest would not lead to changes in its agreement with ImClone and that the two companies would continue to work to have the drug approved.</p>
        <p>Federal officials say that the ImClone securities investigation is continuing and that it is possible additional people will be charged. Already, some of Samuel Waksal's relatives have received notices from the S.E.C., warning them they might be charged, according to lawyers close to the situation.</p>
        <p>The complaints issued yesterday do not identify the family members who sold stock. But based on the accusations and on other information that previously came to light in the Congressional inquiry, one is Samuel Waksal's father, Jack Waksal, and the other is one of his daughters, Aliza Waksal.</p>
        <p>Stephen E. Kaufman, Ms. Waksal's lawyer, said he had no comment. Charles Stillman, the lawyer representing Dr. Waksal's father, a Holocaust survivor who ran a scrap metal business in Dayton, Ohio, before he retired, would not confirm that his client was the one mentioned in the complaints. But Mr. Stillman said the evidence was circumstantial, based on records that phone calls were made, not that people actually spoke.</p>
        <p>According to the complaints, on Dec. 25, Harlan Waksal learned from a Bristol-Myers executive who had talked to the F.D.A. that rejection was ''99 percent likely.'' Samuel Waksal learned this early the next evening, Dec. 26, the complaints said.</p>
        <p>The criminal complaint says that Samuel Waksal tried several times that night to call ''Tippee No. 1,'' the person identified by others as his father. The next morning, Dec. 27, Tippee No. 1 called several brokerage firms and sold a total of 110,000 shares for $6.7 million. He also sold about $83,000 of stock for another individual, whom Congressional investigators have identified as Dr. Waksal's sister, Patti Waksal. The following morning, Dec. 28, Tippee No. 1 sold another 25,000 shares worth $1.4 million.</p>
        <p>The criminal complaint also says that on the morning of Dec. 27, Samuel Waksal called Tippee No. 2, who was on vacation in Idaho. Tippee No. 2 called Merrill Lynch and sold all the holding, about 39,472 shares, worth nearly $2.5 million. A sale of this size on this date by Aliza Waksal had previously been disclosed.</p>
        <p>The complaint also says that on the evening of Dec. 26, shortly after learning of the F.D.A.'s pending decision, Samuel Waksal instructed his accountant to transfer all of his ImClone shares in his Merrill account -- 79,797 shares then worth $4.9 million -- to Tippee No. 2.</p>
        <p>Samuel Waksal, according to the complaint, wanted Merrill to hurry because ImClone was going to stop its executives from trading the shares because the F.D.A. news was pending. ''I understand that ImClone will have a 'blackout' beginning Friday, therefore, you should make sure that this is completed EARLY tomorrow morning,'' said a letter sent by the accountant to Merrill.</p>
        <p>The next day, Dec. 27, Samuel Waksal instructed Merrill to sell all the shares that had been transferred, but the firm refused. Merrill Lynch explained that it needed permission from ImClone's general counsel because the shares had been owned by Samuel Waksal and were still subject to trading restrictions. Samuel Waksal then transferred the shares to Banc of America Securities, but it, too, refused to sell without permission from ImClone.</p>
        <p>The complaint also says that Dr. Waksal appears to have had offshore accounts and that as of Dec. 26 he had more than $80 million in debt, of which more than $65 million was secured by his ImClone stock.</p>
