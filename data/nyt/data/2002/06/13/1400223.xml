        <p>For more than 40 years, even before they were married, Larry and Sara Sprung were a fixture in their Lower East Side neighborhood.</p>
        <p>They walked together, in bad weather and good, when they were young, and then, in their old age, down Grand Street to the synagogue where they worshiped, celebrated holidays and shared their faith with lifelong friends.</p>

        <p>For more than 40 years, even before they were married, Larry and Sara Sprung were a fixture in their Lower East Side neighborhood.</p>
        <p>They walked together, in bad weather and good, when they were young, and then, in their old age, down Grand Street to the synagogue where they worshiped, celebrated holidays and shared their faith with lifelong friends.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Sprung, 86, did not show up to say a prayer on the anniversary of his mother-in-law's death. This troubled his friends and neighbors, some of whom had seen him at the Bialystoker Synagogue on Tuesday while Mrs. Sprung, 88, was next door with 50 other women at the synagogue's annual sisterhood dinner.</p>
        <p>The authorities said that the couple had been fatally shot early yesterday during a burglary and that the suspect, Steven Santos, first killed Raymond Damelio, 49, who lived a floor above them.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Santos, the arrest capped a life of tumult with his relatives and the law. For the victims, the brutal nature of the attacks could not have been more foreign to their lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santos, 20, grew up just blocks from the building where the police say he committed the killings, in the Baruch Houses, a city project on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, his grandmother, Julia Santos, 63, said. Ms. Santos, speaking through a family friend who translated, said, ''He didn't have a bad reputation, but a bad choice of friends and a bad environment.''</p>
        <p>For that reason, she said, and because a relative had filed an order of protection against him, he moved to a cousin's home in Orlando, Fla., when he was 17.</p>
        <p>A year later, he moved to Maryland, where he was arrested with another man in connection with a burglary and sentenced to four years of probation, said his grandmother and the friend, David Glickstein, 62. Less than two weeks ago, they said, he came to New York, violating his probation.</p>
        <p>A probation official in Maryland said Mr. Santos's girlfriend had thrown him out and he had returned to New York because he had no place to stay. On June 6, he spoke to his probation officer and agreed to return, said the official, Richard Sullivan. Mr. Glickstein said Mr. Santos planned to return to Maryland today.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he was living in cramped quarters in Ms. Santos's apartment, in a room shared with his two younger brothers. There, his clothes were still folded after a search by police, Ms. Santos said.. One T-shirt pictured a gangster version of Popeye, one boot stuffed with cash, a marijuana cigar in his teeth and a scantily clad woman perched on his shoulder, and underneath them the legend: ''I am what I am.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Sprungs ''are considered pillars in the community,'' said Deborah Hyman, 37, who grew up nearby and is in the Bialystoker sisterhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sprung had survived many operations and used a cane. He was frail and his wife had to help him. But the couple dressed sharply and gave candy to children.</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Damelio's relatives gathered at his parents' house in Bethlehem, Pa., to grieve and try to plan for his funeral.</p>
        <p>''We're all still in a state of shock; we're all very sad,'' said Mr. Damelio's older brother, Larry, 51. Raymond Damelio was an art director for an advertising firm, was divorced, had no children and had moved to his apartment recently. ''He was so generous,'' Larry Damelio said. ''If you asked him for a glass of water, he'd bring you the whole fountain.''</p>
