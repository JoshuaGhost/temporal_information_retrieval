        <p>The tape is grainy, black-and-white and primitive. The special effects are merely sparklers, used when the Fairy Godmother turns the pumpkin into a stagecoach and gives Cinderella an elegant cape for the ball.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, this artifact is a piece of entertainment history that had been given up for lost: the first dress rehearsal of the CBS television musical ''Cinderella,'' featuring Julie Andrews, recorded on kinescope in Manhattan on March 17, 1957.</p>
        <p>The final production, broadcast live two weeks later, was the only one written by Rodgers and Hammerstein expressly for television, and it was an enormous success for CBS, drawing 107 million viewers compared with the 65 million who watched ''Peter Pan'' on NBC two years earlier. These viewers were a huge new audience for the Broadway team Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II; by contrast, their 1943 hit musical, ''Oklahoma!,'' played for five years and nine weeks to a total of 4.5 million people.</p>
        <p>In an article about ''Cinderella,'' TV Guide wrote, ''The viewer will thus have an opportunity to watch free of charge what most theatergoers would eagerly have paid many dollars to see on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Theodore S. Chapin, the president and executive director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, said recently that the broadcast represented one of the first attempts by television to move into feature-length entertainment. ''It was kind of a mixture of Broadway thinking and television at a time when television was just sort of feeling its way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though critics were not thrilled with the ''Cinderella'' book or the production, they raved about the score and Ms. Andrews.</p>
        <p>The broadcast helped make Ms. Andrews, then 21, a national star; performing in ''My Fair Lady'' on Broadway at the time, she won an Emmy for the Cinderella role. While the kinescope is in black-and-white, the show was broadcast in color for the few who had it in 1957.</p>
        <p>Instead of being discarded, as people assumed, the rehearsal film survived and was discovered in February in the CBS tape archive in Hollywood. It had not been viewed for 45 years. The tape shows a complete rehearsal without breaks.</p>
        <p>Comparing it with the film of the final broadcast, shown on March 31, 1957, offers an unusual glimpse into the creative process behind a television classic when the medium was new. Even the commercials seem unsophisticated by today's standards, advertising products like Old Spice shaving cream -- ''For the man who wants more than just an average shave!'' -- for $1.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan plans to show the tape tomorrow through July 14 in conjunction with its screening series ''Richard Rodgers: The Sound of His Music.'' (The museum will not show the final performance tape in its auditorium, but it can be viewed on an individual monitor.) The series is one of several events celebrating the centennial of Rodgers's birth this year.</p>
        <p>The museum will present a short tape showing significant changes between the rehearsal and final broadcast, followed by the full rehearsal.</p>
        <p>''It's very rare that the process has been documented from the first dress rehearsal,'' said Ron Simon, television curator at the museum. ''In many ways you're in the inner circle of Rodgers and Hammerstein and others as they look at the first staging of 'Cinderella.' ''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most detailed account of the making of ''Cinderella'' is a master's degree thesis by Harold Messing, who became a theatrical lawyer and died in 1993. For his thesis, submitted in August 1957 at Stanford University, Messing was given access to every step of the musical's development and wrote about the rehearsal tape. ''The performance was called the 'New Haven Opening,' and was meant to be the television equivalent of an out-of-town pre-Broadway opening in the legitimate theater,'' he wrote. ''This run-through was to simulate, as closely as possible, the final telecast.''</p>
        <p>So that improvements could be made to the final performance, the rehearsal film was studied by Ralph Nelson, the director; Richard Lewine, the producer; Rodgers, who wrote the music; Hammerstein, who wrote the book and lyrics; and members of the technical team. ''We took it very seriously,'' Mr. Lewine, now 92, said in an interview. ''We knew it was going to have a large audience, and we wanted to be awfully sure we were right, whether it all fell together.''</p>
        <p>The rehearsal film was not shown to cast members. ''Ralph Nelson feared that should the cast be allowed to view themselves, self-criticism might prevail,'' Messing wrote, ''and the performers would possibly appear to be self-conscious about certain movement or might try to 'correct' certain aspects of their performance, which Mr. Nelson felt needed no correction.''</p>
        <p>The TV Guide article quoted the show's writers talking about the rehearsal tape.</p>
        <p>Hammerstein: ''If we found that something didn't fit we cut it out or doctored it.''</p>
        <p>Rodgers: ''That's what's called running scared.''</p>
        <p>After scrutinizing the rehearsal film and two later ones, the creators made several major changes. For example, they decided to open the show with a big number, ''The Prince Is Giving a Ball,'' rather than a scene of Cinderella carrying a teetering tower of boxes through town behind her stepmother and stepsisters, as originally planned.</p>
        <p>They substituted the ruffled coat that the Fairy Godmother bestows on Cinderella for the ball with a shinier satin one and allowed Edie Adams (the Fairy Godmother) to wear her own hair rather than a stiff wig. ''The wig was bothering me,'' Ms. Adams said in an interview, noting that she still has the wig intact.</p>
        <p>The creators also decided that Alice Ghostley and Kaye Ballard should primp in the mirror during their comical number, ''Stepsisters' Lament,'' rather than peer through a curtain as if they were observing Cinderella and the Prince (Jon Cypher).</p>
        <p>Other notes, as cataloged by Messing in his thesis, included a critique of the performances:</p>
        <p>Ms. Andrews and Howard Lindsay, as the King, ''were both using theater technique, singing and speaking to the balcony'' with ''too much projection,'' he wrote. ''Theater technique must be replaced by television technique.''</p>
        <p>''Cinderella should show more regret in singing 'Impossible.' ''</p>
        <p>''Cinderella must not look at her Godmother during the sparkler effect.''</p>
        <p>''Dust should be added to the costume of the Fairy Godmother in order to make her dress appear to be 850 years old.''</p>
        <p>The museum discovered the recording while seeking another lost ''Cinderella'' recording in the CBS vaults. The CBS archives' database lists three 16-millimeter films featuring five-minute segments of Ms. Andrews in ''Cinderella.'' The earliest one turned out, instead, to be the full dress rehearsal. The museum is seeking money so it can transfer the other two films onto tape for its collection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapin said the broadcast grew out of CBS's desire to match the success of ''Peter Pan,'' a Broadway production that had been adapted for television by NBC in 1955 and broadcast again in 1956.</p>
        <p>CBS went after Rodgers and Hammerstein, Broadway's premier writing team. CBS was ''determined to do anything they possibly could to make this thing good,'' Mr. Chapin said.</p>
        <p>Mary Rodgers Guettel, Rodgers's daughter, said her father and Hammerstein were quite taken with television's reach. ''They were fascinated,'' she said, ''particularly by the number of people who were going to see it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Adams said it was a challenge to make a small stage seem large and to manage the traffic of dancers and the quick costume changes in cramped quarters. The show had 56 actors, 115 costumes and a 33-piece orchestra.</p>
        <p>In his thesis, Messing wrote about how much William and Jean Eckart, the scenery and costume designers, had to fit into the 4,200-square-foot studio, including a street scene, the exterior and interior of Cinderella's home, a room in the palace, a ballroom and a garden. The show's budget was about $375,000.</p>
        <p>''To put this on was a big, big deal,'' Ms. Adams said. ''And to bring it into everyone's living room was very, very strange.''</p>
        <p>In what appeared to set the stage for the elaborate publicity machine that exists today, considerable hype preceded the 90-minute Sunday evening broadcast, which pre-empted ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''General Electric Theater.'' From the first rehearsal on Feb. 24, until the broadcast on March 31, CBS issued a news release every day, including biographies of the principal cast members, rehearsal news, human-interest features and information about the costumes, sets, props and expenses.</p>
        <p>Preview record albums with Ms. Andrews performing six songs from ''Cinderella'' were sent to news organizations. Another album of four songs from the show featuring Vic Damone, Peggy King and Paul Weston's orchestra was released four weeks before the broadcast.</p>
        <p>Pepsi-Cola, a sponsor, included five million four-page comic books in cartons of Pepsi sold in the weeks before the broadcast. The musical's soundtrack was advertised during the show and in stores the next day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adams called Nelson, the director, ''the most patient man in the world.'' During rehearsals, she said, he said to Rodgers, who was sitting in the control room, ''If you see anything you don't like, stop the show.'' At one point, Ms. Adams recalled, Rodgers blew his whistle and said, ''The second boy on the left in the chorus, you're singing an A flat.''</p>
        <p>Amid what amounted to a three-ring circus, Rodgers ''only was concentrating on the music,'' Ms. Adams said. ''One little guy who was not singing a right note. How he heard it, nobody knows.''</p>
