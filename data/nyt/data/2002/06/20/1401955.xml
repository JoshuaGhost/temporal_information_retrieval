        <p>For years, Macintosh and Windows power users thirsting for software updates have gone to the oasis of VersionTracker.com, a Web site dedicated to listing news and links to just about every program update, upgrade, patch and new release that has become available.

        <p>While the Web site is still free, users now have the option of paying $24.95 ($19.95 until the end of June) to upgrade to VersionTracker Plus, an enhanced edition that lets members set up customized lists of the programs they want to keep fresh. VersionTracker Plus also gives members full access to its archives and an electronic ''cart'' to pile up with downloads for more organized updating.</p>

        <p>For the really hard-core Apple corps, there is Version 2.0 of VersionTracker Pro. Anyone willing to pay $49.95 for the Pro service will also get a program that monitors the state of the software on the user's Mac, tools to manage networks of as many as 10 Macs and the VersionTracker Ticker for Mac OS X -- a translucent floating desktop palette that displays real-time update information.</p>
        <p>For those who want to keep afloat in the waves of new software for Mac OS X and other Mac-related code, more information on the pay services is available at www.versiontracker.com/pro.</p>
