        <p>A Chinese judge from the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague who ostensibly died of natural causes several years ago is now believed to have been killed by a hospital nurse, Dutch prosecutors said today.</p>
        <p>The nurse, Lucy de Berk, 40, has been under investigation in the deaths of 13 people in her care, who ranged from newborn babies to seriously ill elderly people, public prosecutors said. According to her indictment, she deliberately injected patients with lethal doses of medicine and other substances at three different hospitals in The Hague.</p>
        <p>The impending trial of the nurse has attracted much attention in the Netherlands. Proceedings were to have begun on Monday, but the trial has been postponed to allow further investigation.</p>
        <p>Because of strict privacy rules, few details and no names of victims had been disclosed. But today, after a report from the Dutch news agency A.N.P., a spokesman at the district court in The Hague confirmed for the first time that Judge Li Haopei, 91, of China was listed in the indictment as one of the nurse's victims.</p>
        <p>The judge had checked into the Red Cross Hospital in The Hague for an unknown illness weeks before he was to have retired. After a short stay, he died in the hospital on Nov. 6, 1997. At the time, authorities ruled that he died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>But the indictment of Ms. de Berk, according to a court official, said that the nurse ''deliberately, with or without premeditation, administered one or several substances'' that killed Mr. Li.</p>
        <p>A spokesman at the prosecutor's office said today that, ''We suspect that the judge was one of her victims.'' A prosecutor on the case described Ms. de Berk as a ''classic psychopath'' who is obsessed with death.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Berk has denied the charges. She has also refused to cooperate with a psychiatric examination while in prison, and said at a pretrial hearing: ''I did not do anything that would justify such an examination and investigation. If I need psychological help, then I will seek it myself.''</p>
        <p>It was not immediately known whether the Dutch authorities had informed their Chinese counterparts that the judge is now believed to have been killed. Chinese diplomats in The Hague could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Nor was comment available at the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is trying former President Slobodan Milosevic and others accused of crimes during the Balkan wars.</p>
        <p>Judge Li, who joined the tribunal at its creation in 1993, was never involved in a trial, but he served until his death as a member of the tribunal's appeals chamber. He was a legal scholar who often represented China at international conferences and law institutes.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Berk, who spent part of her youth in Canada but returned to the Netherlands as an adult, was arrested last December, three months after she was suspended by the Juliana Children's hospital in The Hague. The case that first aroused suspicion against her involved an infant who died less than an hour after an extensive physical examination. She is now also being accused of the deaths of three other babies, which had at first gone unremarked because the three were born with severe abnormalities.</p>
        <p>The nurse is said to have killed her victims by administering morphine, potassium or other substances. The police suspect her of having mistreated a total of 19 patients, 13 of whom died between 1997 and 2001.</p>
