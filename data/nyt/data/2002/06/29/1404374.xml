        <p>A black group in the racially divided Amityville school district on Long Island is taking legal action to overturn last month's school board election, charging that its slate lost because officials mishandled the results from a faulty voting machine, resulting in an all-white board.</p>
        <p>School district officials acknowledge that a misaligned ballot on one of four voting machines caused hundreds of votes to be registered on the wrong rows, but deny that the election results were affected.</p>
        <p>The group, Strong Voice Parents, filed a formal appeal last week asking the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, to exercise his power to stay the election results and block the three declared winners from taking office.</p>
        <p>''It's worse than Florida,'' said Alexandra Gilmore, the president of the group, in an interview yesterday, referring to the disputed results of the 2000 presidential election. Her group seeks to have its slate declared victorious or be granted a new election. The group also filed suit Thursday in United States District Court in Central Islip, N.Y., claiming violations of civil and voting rights.</p>
        <p>The school district's lawyer, LeRoy Van Nostrand Jr., rejected the claims, saying, ''Even if we discounted this machine, the same people would have won.''</p>
        <p>The district's population is about half white and half black or Hispanic. But many white parents send their children to private school, so the public school enrollment is more than 80 percent black and Hispanic. Mrs. Gilmore and other minority critics accuse the school board's white majority of shortchanging the students to keep taxes down.</p>
        <p>Both sides agree that the voting machine company set up one machine improperly, so that hundreds of votes were registered under blank spots on the ballot while some candidates received no votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Nostrand said that after consulting with the owner of the voting-machine company, George Wolfe, a former county elections commissioner, he agreed it was clear that the rows of figures were misaligned with the names on the ballot. So for the final tally, district officials reassigned the votes to the rows that voters had intended, Mr. Van Nostrand said.</p>
        <p>But the lawyer for Strong Voice Parents, John Ray, said: ''They flip- flopped the black-supported candidates' votes to the white candidates, and vice versa. The broken machine had enough votes to affect the outcome.'' He contended that at least two members of the Strong Voice slate, composed of two blacks and a white ally, were the real winners.</p>
        <p>The board has seven seats, and two current members are black. One of the black members declined to seek re-election, and the other was on the Strong Voice Parents slate. Unless the education commissioner or the court intervenes, the candidates who have been declared winners will take office on Tuesday. The board's president, Stephannie Andrews, who was not up for re-election, defended the announced election results as proper.</p>
        <p>In the confusion on election night, May 21, Mrs. Gilmore says, she and others demanded that the voting machines be impounded for further examination. But she said that district officials and the voting machine company ignored her and turned the counters back to zero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Nostrand said there had been no formal request to impound the machines. He attributed the Strong Voice slate's loss to a poor turnout by minority voters. ''Three quarters of the students are black, but only 10 percent of the black people vote,'' he said. ''That's the answer.''</p>
