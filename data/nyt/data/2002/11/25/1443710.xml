        <p>'La Wally'  Teatro Grattacielo  Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>When the 1981 French film ''Diva'' became a surprise sensation, the composer Alfredo Catalani had his 15 minutes of fame. In the film the soprano Wilhelmenia Fernandez, the diva of the title, sings a poignantly beautiful aria, ''Ebben? Ne andro lontano,'' from Catalani's 1892 opera, ''La Wally.'' Suddenly young American pop fans who didn't know a note of Puccini were agog over Catalani.</p>
        <p>There was a period when ''La Wally'' turned up occasionally in productions, but since then it has fallen into neglect. To the rescue has come Teatro Grattacielo, which since 1994 has presented one little-known Italian verismo opera each year in a concert performance. On Monday night at Alice Tully Hall, Guido Ajmone-Marsan conducted the Teatro Grattacielo Orchestra and Chorus and seven soloists in ''La Wally.'' A large audience turned out.</p>
        <p>Catalani, a colleague of Puccini, was born four years earlier, in 1854, and in the same town, Lucca. He died in 1893 at 39, and ''La Wally'' was his last and best opera.</p>
        <p>The work's shortcoming is its dramaturgy. Wally, the beautiful but hardened daughter of an abusive Swiss landowner, is confounded by the mixed romantic messages she gets from Hagenbach, a hunter from a rival town. At the end, just as he reaches Wally in her mountain hideout to proclaim his love, Hagenbach is buried in an avalanche, and Wally hurls herself from a cliff.</p>
        <p>Knowing he was dying, Catalani poured all he had into this work, underlining every interchange between characters with surging orchestra outbursts. But the pacing is too slow. The simplest music is the best. Still, it's at least as strong an opera as ''Andrea Ch√©nier,'' which is frequently performed.</p>
        <p>Singing the challenging title role was Manon Feubel, a feisty Quebec soprano in her American debut. Her big, dusky voice has cutting power in its top range, if a little weakness in the low register. As Hagenbach, Frank Porretta pushed his tenor voice worrisomely. A standout was Monica Yunus, a bright-voiced coloratura, in the role of Walter. Under Mr. Ajmone-Marsan, the orchestra gave an exuberant and colorful, if not always tidy, account of this teeming and admirable score.</p>
