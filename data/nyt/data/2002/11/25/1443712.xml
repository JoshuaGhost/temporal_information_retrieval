        <p>Numerous marketers, including General Motors and PepsiCo, have also been making changes on their assignments to create campaigns aimed at black, Hispanic, Asian-American and other multicultural consumers. The online editions of Advertising Age and Adweek reported last week that the Kmart Corporation would shift its multicultural accounts to other agencies. Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Kmart, declined to comment.</p>
