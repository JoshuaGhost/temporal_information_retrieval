        <p>ADLINE WILSON takes two buses and then two subways every morning to get from her home in Uniondale to her job as a hospital clerk on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''You do it enough and you don't even think about it anymore,'' she said while rushing to catch a connection at the Hempstead bus terminal one recent evening. Her commute is two hours each way.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael M. Bloomberg's plan to impose a new income tax on commuters, on the other hand, definitely has given her something to think and complain about.</p>
        <p>''It'll be a big bite out of my paycheck and I can't afford it,'' said Mrs. Wilson, who earns only about $30,000 a year and takes the bus because the train is more expensive. ''It won't hurt the people on Wall Street. It's the little people like me who are going to feel it the most.''</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, oppose the commuter tax plan, dooming it in its current form. Just in case, Long Island legislators have started collecting signatures from riders on the Long Island Rail Road as part of a campaign to make sure the State Legislature does not impose the mayor's plan on the 265,000 Long Islanders who work in New York City.</p>
        <p>But officials and policy analysts have speculated that the Bloomberg proposal is a bargaining ploy intended to get state officials to approve a smaller, more defensible, commuter tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's proposal would extend the city's income tax to commuters, producing a tax that is roughly six times higher than the commuter tax that state officials eliminated with great fanfare three years ago. Under the proposed tax, a Long Islander who makes about $100,000 a year in New York City would pay about $2,100 a year, or about $9 a day -- a considerable sum when added to the cost of commuting.</p>
        <p>While Mayor Bloomberg and his supporters argue that the debate should focus on how much in city services a commuter consumes, Long Island officials counter that commuters pour millions, if not billions, of dollars into the city's economy each year and that those contributions should not be ignored.</p>
        <p>Fiscal experts are just as divided on the subject. Some say the proposed income tax would drive jobs out of the city and ultimately might hurt not just the city's economy, but that of the entire region. Others reason that some form of a commuter tax is justifiable, but say Mr. Bloomberg's plan to tax commuters and residents at the same rate is not.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bloomberg insists that ''nothing could be fairer'' than having commuters pay for their services, city officials have not produced any figures to show how much commuters actually cost the city in added services. But a study done by an economics professor at Hunter College, Howard Chernick, concludes that commuters cost the city between $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion a year in additional city services, or between $1,480 and $2,343 per commuter.</p>
        <p>That would suggest that Mayor Bloomberg's proposal is not that unreasonable. But Dr. Chernick maintained that while his study shows that commuters do in fact cost the city money, they should not be expected to pay the same rate as residents since they do not consume the same level of services. He endorsed the reinstatement of the old commuter tax of 0.45 percent, which cost the commuter with a $100,000 salary about $400 a year. When revenues from a commuter tax like the previous one of 0.45 percent are added to the sales taxes paid by commuters for meals, shopping and services bought in the city, and the business taxes that employers already pay for each job, he said, the tax revenue estimate from each commuter job adds up to $2,253 -- a number that falls right within his commuter cost estimate.</p>
        <p>''It's justified on the grounds of equity and efficiency,'' Dr. Chernick said of the 0.45 percent commuter tax. ''It's equitable because it taxes workers who tend to be higher-income people, and it's efficient because not having the tax gives commuters a free ride and makes it easier for people to take jobs in the city and move to the suburbs.''</p>
        <p>Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said Mr. Bloomberg's proposed tax would hurt individual taxpayers and therefore ''would be a significant drag on the Long Island economy because it would affect consumer spending.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kamer said the proposed income tax ''would negate the LIPA rebate and a whole lot of other things because it would erode the disposable income of Long Islanders.'' She was referring to the rebate and cut in electrical rates that Long Islanders received in 1998 when the Long Island Power Authority was created to replace the Long Island Lighting Company.</p>
        <p>In the short run, she said, Long Island might benefit from the tax as some commuters might choose to leave their jobs in the city for ones on the Island and some businesses might move to the suburbs. But she said the tax ultimately could hurt the whole region.</p>
        <p>''The health of New York City's economy is essential to Long Island's economic health,'' she said. ''But by the same token, New York City is dependent on the skills of Long Island residents and other suburbanites, and if the city loses those skills, it could lose that base. That base might shift to the suburbs, but we also run the risk that it might leave for other regions entirely.''</p>
        <p>James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group, said, however, that as upset as many commuters may be by a tax, workers and their jobs were unlikely to head for the suburbs. The institute studied the economic relationship of suburb to city and found that between 1991 and 1998, Long Island had become more dependent on the city for jobs.</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, commuter wages of $8.6 billion in 1991 accounted for 49 percent of total wages earned by county residents. By 1998, the figure had grown to $12.7 billion, or 56 percent. Suffolk County's reliance was lower, but also grew from $3.1 billion or 22 percent of total wages to $4.6 billion or 23 percent.</p>
        <p>''The importance of commuter wages to the suburban economy grew substantially in the 1990's,'' he said, noting that the shift was due in part to Long Island's loss of some 50,000 jobs in the aerospace and defense industries in the late 1980's and early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parrott also pointed out that commuters tend to work at higher-paying jobs, particularly in the financial sector, which accounts for a remarkable 76 percent rise in total commuter wages between 1991 and 1998, going from $35.9 billion to $63.1 billion. Total wages for city residents, by contrast, increased by only 40 percent.</p>
        <p>''A commuter tax is not going to result in droves of people quitting their city jobs,'' he said. ''In this economy, in recession with no upturn in sight? You've got to be kidding.''</p>
        <p>But even if the jobs and the commuters stay where they are, the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has argued against the commuter tax on the grounds that the city should not pit city against suburb. Both the city and Nassau County have been hurt by the slowing economy and by the need to shoulder increased Medicaid burdens, and Mr. Suozzi's spokesman, Bruce Nyman, argued that together they should push for a change in the Medicaid funding system.</p>
        <p>''The answer isn't a commuter tax or a Long Island tax,'' Mr. Nyman said. ''There needs to be a statewide answer for the problems of the city, Nassau County, Westchester and all the other local municipalities.''</p>
        <p>Unlike New Jersey officials who have called for new taxes on commuters to their state, Mr. Suozzi opposes any retaliatory tax on the tens of thousands of city residents who commute to Long Island. ''What's next then, setting up moats and gates?'' Mr. Nyman said. ''We need to work together.''</p>
        <p>E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy research center, agreed that commuters should not be subject to any commuter tax, mainly because the city already heavily taxes employers in the form of business income taxes and commercial rent tax. ''All those taxes are designed to tap into the stream of wealth generated by workers,'' he said. ''So businesses already are paying many times over for the services their people are consuming.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon also said that commuters use very few city services, mainly just those of the police and fire departments. Large portions of the city budget are dedicated to the school system and welfare programs, which do not benefit commuters at all, he added.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Chernick said commuters benefit indirectly from maintaining the city's quality of life, including services to the poor. ''Things like traffic, environmental protection and sanitation, these are all services that make the city an orderly place and that's consumed by everybody who comes here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMahon also contended that commuters already pay for their share of city services through their huge contribution to the city's economy and the sales taxes generated from their spending. He estimated that commuters easily pour several billion dollars into the city each year and calculated that even with a daily expenditure of about $5 a day, the city's 800,000 commuters would easily spend more than $1 billion. ''And that's not taking into account the special occasions, dinner and theater or season tickets to the Rangers,'' he said. ''Commuters do a lot of these things because they're already here, and a lot of that would vanish if they were back in Mineola or White Plains.''</p>
        <p>Edward Shannon, who commutes to Lower Manhattan from Garden City for his job as a money broker, said he sees the city at large ''as kind of like an extended office for me.'' He has breakfast meetings around town, rides the subway to get around and buys all kinds of supplies for home and office while he's there.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, he might have taken a tougher position against the commuter tax, he said, but watching the city suffer through Sept. 11 and its aftermath has changed his perspective somewhat.</p>
        <p>''Do I want to pay a commuter tax? Absolutely not,'' he said. ''But I understand the mayor's got to get the money from somewhere and if he a needs a few dollars, I don't have a problem with it.''</p>
