        <p>Looking forward today often means looking back. What this says about the state of originality is another discussion entirely, but it doesn't mean that style-meisters are recreating the past with Merchant Ivory precision. That strange country known as Austin Powers is a nice place to visit, but frankly, who wants to live with shag carpet, round beds and slipshod dental care? True aesthetes are relentless editors, separating a past master's wheat from his chaff. (Yes, even Mies van der Rohe had off days.) What remains to be admired is a highly refined sampling of a designer's oeuvre, a few choice pieces elevated to newly iconic status and sprinkled through rooms with care. The goal is elegance, not irony. Where to start? Scandinavia is always fertile ground, and the more mod the designer, the better. Enter Verner Panton.</p>
        <p>More than any of his peers, the jocular, bearded Panton (1926-1998) was the guy who made the 60's swing and the 70's sizzle. From his funnel-shaped Cone Chair to a round television that dangled from the ceiling like a giant white eyeball, the Danish architect and designer's work was consciously directed at the free-love set, transporting the politics, passions and polymorphous sexuality of the Age of Aquarius into innocent living rooms across the globe. Even today, the mere presence of a Panton piece -- typically combining primary colors with alien undulations that invite subtly compromising postures -- can transform an otherwise unremarkable suburban dad into a block-party babe magnet. Consider the psychosexual allure of Panton's Living Tower, for instance. A foam-cushioned, fabric-covered extravagance, the giant Living Tower was a sort of cat's jungle gym for consenting adults, its curving contours incorporating ledges for lounging, protrusions for sitting and one flat surface for doing, well, presumably whatever came naturally. It was provocative, inviting, insinuating. And like almost everything else Panton put his hand to, it was pure genius.</p>

        <p>More than any of his peers, the jocular, bearded Panton (1926-1998) was the guy who made the 60's swing and the 70's sizzle. From his funnel-shaped Cone Chair to a round television that dangled from the ceiling like a giant white eyeball, the Danish architect and designer's work was consciously directed at the free-love set, transporting the politics, passions and polymorphous sexuality of the Age of Aquarius into innocent living rooms across the globe. Even today, the mere presence of a Panton piece -- typically combining primary colors with alien undulations that invite subtly compromising postures -- can transform an otherwise unremarkable suburban dad into a block-party babe magnet. Consider the psychosexual allure of Panton's Living Tower, for instance. A foam-cushioned, fabric-covered extravagance, the giant Living Tower was a sort of cat's jungle gym for consenting adults, its curving contours incorporating ledges for lounging, protrusions for sitting and one flat surface for doing, well, presumably whatever came naturally. It was provocative, inviting, insinuating. And like almost everything else Panton put his hand to, it was pure genius.</p>
        <p>''He is the ultimate in cool,'' says Miles Redd, a Manhattan interior decorator. His prize Panton is one of the designer's Fun lights, designed in 1964. Made of graduated tiers of wafer-thin Capiz shells -- one model incorporates more than 6,000 -- threaded onto metal rings, it shimmies and shakes from Redd's kitchen ceiling like a sequined miniskirt, right above a regal little French banquette.</p>
        <p>''He's a true original,'' says Michael Maharam, a Panton fan who is a principal of the textile company Maharam, which he runs with his brother, Stephen. ''I don't collect the work of the 1950's British modernists Lucienne and Robin Day, for instance, because I find their work derivative of a lot of other things that were going on at the same time,'' Maharam explains. ''But Panton is different. He was a first in many ways.''</p>
        <p>Verner Panton didn't start out as the patron saint of groovy. He grew up as far from conventional design circles as possible, on a charming island populated by cows, the child of innkeepers. But he dreamed of bigger, more usual surrounds, particularly of a room furnished solely in soft upholstered cushions. Psychologists would probably have had a field day with that one, but the dream of an adaptable interior -- the pillows could be stacked up, slumped against and built into platforms for sleeping, dining, relaxing and more -- was the key to his anarchic philosophy of design that does more than it seems. ''I can't bear to enter a room and see the sofa and coffee table and two armchairs, immediately knowing that we are going to be stuck there for an entire evening,'' he once said. Instead, he wanted to make ''furniture that could be raised and lowered in space so that you could have a different view of the surroundings and a new angle on life.''</p>
        <p>It's that approach to home furnishings that leaves some shoppers -- Americans primarily -- slightly puzzled. ''Europeans and Asians get the furniture totally,'' says Zesty Meyers of R 20th Century, a vintage-furniture gallery in TriBeCa. ''Americans don't. Yet. They don't know what to do with it. You sit on it, you eat on it, you can probably even sleep on it in some cases. So I sell a lot of his shell lamps.''</p>
        <p>For all of his getting into the groove, Panton began his career conventionally enough, studying architecture in Copenhagen. For a time he toiled in the office of Arne Jacobsen, where he (apparently uncredited) was involved in the design of his boss's epochal three-legged Ant chair. But around the time that Panton left Jacobsen's employ, something snapped. He left his first wife (a stepdaughter of yet another renowned designing Dane, Poul Henningsen), jumped into a Volkswagen bus and never looked back. It was a typical 60's road trip, the first of many, but with a mission: to study modern design wherever he saw it, from one European city to the next. And when Panton finally returned home, he quietly began churning out the components for living in a mod, mod, mod, mod world.</p>
        <p>Inflatable furniture. Round plastic armoires. A stacking chair that looks for all the world like an upholstered dog bowl. Plywood kids' furniture with Swiss-cheese perforations. Ceiling lamps that look like suction cups. Molded plastic wall panels that look like breastplates for Barbarella. (The rocker Lenny Kravitz is crazy about those.) One year, Panton introduced the infamous 3-D Carpet, a wall-to-wall mountain range for the home that incorporated chairs, tables and recliners, all upholstered in the same shaggy material (O.K., so his sense of design wasn't flawless), and for the Hamburg headquarters of the German publishing house Spiegel, Panton installed lilac conference rooms, polka-dot carpeting and a lobby paneled in illuminated plastic bumps. Like him or not, Panton is back. Not as a fad, mind you, but as an example of the increasing fascination with postwar design eminences. Reproductions of some of Panton's Op Art textiles were recently introduced by the Maharam brothers, while vintage Panton textiles have been transformed into men's wear by the young Danish designer Daniel Schou. Extravagantly overscale Fun lamps are trading hands for as much as $24,000, but simpler $1,000 versions abound, and in hip living rooms coast to coast Panton furniture is making an appearance. For an excellent reason, it seems.</p>
        <p>''Anyone can design a chair that looks good, but if a designer manages to produce a chair that's comfortable for multiple body sizes, he's brilliant,'' Zesty Meyers says, referring to the designer's most famous work, the Panton stacking chair, a slithering S curve of colorful lacquered polyurethane that took its creator nearly a decade to perfect.</p>
        <p>Apparently more than a few people agree. Meyers's all-Panton show in October 2001 attracted record numbers of visitors, who braved its ground zero environs to see America's first Panton paean. The reaction validated Meyers's years of immersion in Pantoniana. ''He's the king of pop design. The only thing left now is for somebody to design furniture that's invisible.''</p>
