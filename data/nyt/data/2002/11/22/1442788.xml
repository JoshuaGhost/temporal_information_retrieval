        <p>Harvey Araton Sports of The Times column contends that developmental leagues, designed to help basketball players who might have forgone college to pursue NBA to improve skills, do not often accomplish goals, and instead seem to focus on building credentials of coaches; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THE associates and sycophants who told him he was ready for the pros, for the league of untold riches, have been silenced now, or have just disappeared. Not yet 21, Lenny Cooke is a commodity no more, just another shooting guard who took the first available fling at the big time and came up far, far short of the rim.</p>
        <p>Not drafted last June, unable to stick with Seattle over the summer, the 6-foot-6-inch Cooke was cut by the Columbus Riverdragons of the N.B.A.'s developmental league two weeks ago. For now, possibly forever, the highlight of his professional career remains the bold announcement by the former New York-area high school prodigy and Brooklyn native at Junior's Restaurant on Flatbush Avenue that he intended to bypass college and go for the gold.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping one of the other teams in the D league will pick him up,'' said Cooke's latest agent, the New York-based Kenneth Glassman. ''Otherwise, it'll be a long winter of him working and giving it a shot next spring in the U.S.B.L.''</p>
        <p>That's another minor league, the United States Basketball League, where dreamers drift in the basketball bushes. In its mission to put its imprimatur on every aspect of its marketplace, the N.B.A. introduced the National Basketball Developmental League last season, with franchises in eight small southeastern cities, presumably for players like Lenny Cooke.</p>
        <p>Beyond the reflexive urge to scold Cooke for sabotaging himself, for being easily influenced, as Glassman said, ''sometimes by the wrong people,'' Cooke's unceremonious dismissal from the N.B.D.L. after three days and the explanation offered for it raises the issue of priorities of a sport inundated with talented young players who are grossly inexperienced and fundamentally flawed.</p>
        <p>''I just think he doesn't know how to play the pro game,'' Jeff Malone, the Columbus coach, recently said. ''He's one of those guys, if we had extra players, we'd try to keep him, to try to really teach him the game.''</p>
        <p>Well, excuse me, but isn't that the point of a developmental league?</p>
        <p>At closer inspection, you have to wonder if it is more for résumé-building coaches than for players in need of structure and discipline. Columbus's first pick of the 14-round N.B.D.L. draft this year was Derek Strong, a 34-year-old journeyman forward. Players who have long outgrown prospect status are sprinkled throughout the league. The team in Roanoke, Va., has four players, nearly half its roster, between the ages of 27 and 30.</p>
        <p>Even on the drawing board, the N.B.D.L. was a contradiction, a planned training vehicle that required its players to be 20, while its N.B.A. parent accepts teenagers right out of high school. Hence, the N.B.A., which charges a pretty penny for the privilege of watching the world's best players, releases more veterans like Strong season after season while drafting teenagers who are at least a couple of years away from being ready to play.</p>
        <p>So now the Lakers' legend Jerry West assumes control of the Memphis Grizzlies and is so sobered by the team's collective grasp of the game that he feels compelled to exhume Hubie Brown, returning him to the N.B.A. 16 years after the league discarded this self-styled genius at the prime coaching age of 53. Hubie's mandate: solve some of the deep-rooted problems he helped create.</p>
        <p>Those of us who covered Hubie Brown during his tumultuous years at the Knicks' helm can certainly attest to his powerful work ethic and attention to detail -- to the extreme of reducing most players to drones in a canned-vegetables system that glorified the coach when it worked and blamed the players for not fitting in when it didn't.</p>
        <p>Thanks in large part to the likes of Hubie and his more stylish disciple, Pat Riley, the N.B.A. has become a coach-dominated society, with a product less flowing and players lacking in the ability to mix spontaneous play with sound instinct and judgment. Come the inevitable realization in Memphis that Hubie is and always was no more than a boot-camp barker, I would suggest that he be directed right to the D league, where he might drill some real-world sense into the kids whose heads are filled with delusion before they have learned a pick from a roll.</p>
        <p>That apparently was Lenny Cooke's problem after he began pouring in the points at Manhattan's LaSalle Academy to when he abandoned a plan to finish high school in Old Tappan, N.J., and at least keep the option of playing ball at a junior college if he failed to academically qualify for Division I.</p>
        <p>At a recent game, I asked Amare Stoudemire, a 20-year-old rookie Phoenix Suns power forward drafted out of high school, if he'd heard that Cooke, on the high school all-star circuit with him last spring, had failed to make the D league.</p>
        <p>''That's sad,'' Stoudemire said. ''But you've got to be smart. Use your head, man. You don't sign with an agent unless you've been told you are going to be a first-round draft pick and you'll get guaranteed money.''</p>
        <p>Cooke didn't listen to the people who preached patience. No one ever said he was a bad kid. Those who tried to help him didn't stop liking him. They just shook their heads when he showed up last spring with the trinkets of the trade, with the news that he was in the camp of a California agent, now long gone.</p>
        <p>Asked the other day where Cooke was, Glassman said he was in Virginia, visiting family, not reachable on his old cellphone, which he no longer has. Life can get cold when you're out of the draft. Since Cooke's return from Columbus, Glassman said he had been putting his client up at a modest hotel while waiting to see if he might land elsewhere, the housing alternative being the couches of Brooklyn friends.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to get him back on his feet,'' Glassman said. ''No one has said this kid doesn't have talent. He just needs a place to play.''</p>
        <p>At this point, a $12,000 gig in a league that was supposed to be for people like him is about as rich as the modified dream can be.</p>
