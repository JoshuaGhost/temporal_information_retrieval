        <p>Olga Lorena Valdez was such a doting and protective mother, a neighbor said today, that she treated photos of her children like precious objects. When pregnant just over a year ago, Ms. Valdez gushed about the new life inside her.</p>

        <p>WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Nov. 21 Â— Olga Lorena Valdez was such a doting and protective mother, a neighbor said today, that she treated photos of her children like precious objects. When pregnant just over a year ago, Ms.Valdez gushed about the new life inside her.</p>

        <p>Olga Lorena Valdez was such a doting and protective mother, a neighbor said today, that she treated photos of her children like precious objects. When pregnant just over a year ago, Ms. Valdez gushed about the new life inside her.</p>
        <p>But the neighbor, who said she had once worked alongside Ms. Valdez at an air-conditioner assembly plant, also remembered her as an impatient, short-tempered woman who lashed out at her colleagues with an expletive-filled tirade for what seemed a minor slight.</p>
        <p>''She was a nice, quiet, reserved type of person,'' recalled the neighbor, Mayra DeLeon. ''But then, she had a temper. I mean, if things weren't right, she would just burst.''</p>
        <p>Friends and neighbors of Ms. Valdez tried to reconcile those contrasting images today, less than 24 hours after she was charged with killing her two young daughters by suffocating them with a pillow while they slept.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that the police discovered the unresponsive bodies of Loiana Valdez, 5, and Larilis, 1, lying on a bed in a second-floor bedroom here shortly after 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, responding to a 911 call from their mother. The girls were pronounced dead about an hour later, and Ms. Valdez, 28, was arraigned in Superior Court in Middlesex County late Wednesday on two counts of murder. She is being held in $500,000 bond.</p>
        <p>Ms. Valdez did not have a lawyer at her court appearance on Wednesday. The authorities said she had been cooperating with investigators and had given prosecutors a statement, although officials declined to comment on what she had said.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said detectives were still investigating the case and would not discuss a possible motive.</p>
        <p>But today, neighbors offered their own theories.</p>
        <p>They described subtle fissures in what had appeared to be a stable relationship between Ms. Valdez and her husband, Edward Valdez Rodriguez, 28. Neighbors said she had recently spoken of leaving him and taking their two children to Puerto Rico. A woman who lived down the street said she had heard the couple having a loud argument the night before the girls were killed. Some suggested that Ms. Valdez had suffered from postpartum depression.</p>
        <p>Just as they tried to understand what most said was an unfathomable crime, neighbors, relatives and friends puzzled through their own conflicting images of Ms. Valdez.</p>
        <p>''She was a good mother,'' said Ramon Familia, 23, a family friend who lives nearby in Perth Amboy. ''Something just got into her, the devil or something.''</p>
        <p>Juan Carlos Valdez, a cousin of Ms. Valdez's husband, said family members were trying their best to console Mr. Valdez, who was working at a Perth Amboy trucking company when the girls were killed.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't even talk or anything,'' said the cousin, 22. ''He's still in shock, you know.'' He said the husband was staying for now with family in Perth Amboy.</p>
        <p>He said that the couple, who shared roots in the Dominican Republic, had been married for about six years. They had spent the last 11 months in a three-story house on Judy Drive, in a working-class development of squat duplexes east of the Garden State Parkway.</p>
        <p>An impromptu shrine materialized overnight in front of the garage door of the Valdez home, made up of candles, stuffed animals and cards bearing handwritten messages. One read, ''In loving memory of the angels.''</p>
        <p>Juan Carlos Valdez, who bought a home next door to his cousin, said the couple's marriage was solid. ''It was a good relationship,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One neighbor, Blanca Vera, 43, said she had thought the same, but recalled a loud argument between the couple on Tuesday night. ''I heard an argument that was coming from the house,'' Ms. Vera said. ''Then, the next morning I saw the police cars. I didn't think that what I heard would end up like this.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DeLeon, who said she had worked with Ms. Valdez at the Frigidaire air-conditioning plant in Edison, N.J., and who lives up the street from her, remembered her friend talking about disagreements with her husband. ''But nothing major,'' she said. ''Nothing that would make her explode like that. Just the disagreements every couple has.''</p>
        <p>Miosoti Reyes, 31, stood across the street from the Valdez home today and described the young family as polite and friendly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reyes said that her own daughter, Heather, had attended kindergarten classes with Loiana Valdez at the Port Reading School No. 9. ''She asked me about the mother and how that happened,'' Ms. Reyes said, motioning toward her daughter.</p>
        <p>''I just tell her that her mother felt bad,'' Ms. Reyes. ''I don't know how to explain it good to her.''</p>
        <p>She paused for a long moment and turned to look across the street, toward the driveway filled with candles and the front steps strung with police tape. ''It's hard for me to believe,'' she said. ''How can I start to explain it to her?''</p>
