        <p>Re ''Few Options for Treating Autism,'' by Polly Morrice (Op-Ed, Nov. 12):</p>
        <p>One of the fundamental reasons that there are few options is the great lack of proper training for special education teachers in this area. Most of their training is to teach learning-disabled students -- not those who have strong cognitive skills along with attention and social difficulties.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Few Options for Treating Autism,'' by Polly Morrice (Op-Ed, Nov. 12):</p>
        <p>One of the fundamental reasons that there are few options is the great lack of proper training for special education teachers in this area. Most of their training is to teach learning-disabled students -- not those who have strong cognitive skills along with attention and social difficulties.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morrice is correct when she says parents will be on their own to find the proper services for their child. But many parents believe that the services their towns provide is sufficient and do not look at more specialized and up-to-date programs.</p>
        <p>Often parents are not even sure what to ask for. I feel lucky that I provided my child with a state-of-the-art private early-intervention program. However, I am left to constantly evaluate his elementary school classes, wondering when developmental disabilities will get the attention they deserve.</p>
