        <p>Heavy winds left much of northwestern Connecticut without electricity yesterday and made roads impassable from downed tree limbs heavy with ice. Some residents without heat visited emergency shelters as workers repaired electrical equipment and northern towns braced for another cold, wet night.</p>
        <p>''We've been jury-rigging every type of operation to make sure we're functioning as best we can,'' said Owen J. Quinn Jr., the mayor of Torrington. ''It was much greater in strength than we anticipated,'' he said of the northeaster, which struck Saturday and continued to menace the area yesterday.</p>

        <p>Heavy winds left much of northwestern Connecticut without electricity yesterday and made roads impassable from downed tree limbs heavy with ice. Some residents without heat visited emergency shelters as workers repaired electrical equipment and northern towns braced for another cold, wet night.</p>
        <p>''We've been jury-rigging every type of operation to make sure we're functioning as best we can,'' said Owen J. Quinn Jr., the mayor of Torrington. ''It was much greater in strength than we anticipated,'' he said of the northeaster, which struck Saturday and continued to menace the area yesterday.</p>
        <p>About 130,000 Connecticut customers were without electricity at some point, and most still had no power last night, according to the Connecticut Light and Power Company.</p>
        <p>In New York, eastern Long Island was hardest hit by the northeaster, which dropped one to two inches of rain and produced gusts of about 35 miles per hour. ''It's moving slowly through now,'' said Matthew Hirsch, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, an inch and a half of rain had fallen in Central Park by last evening. New Jersey had about the same amount of rain, causing minor flooding near the coast.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, more than half of Torrington's 36,000 residents lost power. Crews restored power to more than 9,000 of them by nightfall and hoped to have most service restored today, said Lee J. Olivier, president of Connecticut Light and Power. It could take a week or more to complete repairs to the most remote customers.</p>
        <p>Tina Walker, who lives high on a hill overlooking Lake Waramaug, in Warren, said she and her husband, Richard, and their 6-year-old son, Jordan, lay awake for much of Saturday night, listening to large icicles drop from trees and slam onto their roof.</p>
        <p>''Oh my goodness, it sounded like huge rocks were crashing over our heads,'' she said. ''And the wind was howling so loud, it was really horrifying. There are trees and branches down everywhere, there are electric wires and cables and telephone poles down all over the place.''</p>
        <p>More freezing rain and winds were expected last night and this morning. ''We're holding our breath on the weather,'' said Robert Milano, deputy police chief in Torrington.</p>
        <p>The area was fortunate in the storm's timing, well enough before winter to keep the ground and roads from freezing. ''Everything above ground level froze and fell on the ground,'' Chief Milano said.</p>
        <p>Firefighters worked around the clock dealing with downed power lines.</p>
        <p>The power company and the city worked to clear at least one lane of all roads. Downed limbs and power lines kept most people off the streets, and there were no major accidents reported.</p>
        <p>''It's a mess up here,'' said Trooper Kathy Lauretano of the Connecticut State Police. Schools in Torrington were closed today because of concerns that bus routes would still be blocked. Torrington Middle School was used as a shelter last night, running on power from an emergency generator, and two shelters were open in town, serving soup, snacks and coffee. Volunteers drove vans to the homes of shut-ins.</p>
        <p>Power lines were threatened not just by ice, but also by vehicles. After leaves fall, trees tend to blow less in the wind. But wet leaves on roads make driving difficult, leading to more cars skidding into poles.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of a good-news, bad-news kind of situation,'' said Michael Lowndes of the Long Island Power Authority. More than 7,000 customers lost power at some point over the weekend, Mr. Lowndes said.</p>
        <p>Forecasters predicted more winds today as the storm passes out of the region.</p>
        <p>A Connecticut man, Donald Roux, 36, was killed when his truck went off a road in Colchester. The police said they had not determined the extent to which the weather contributed to the accident.</p>
        <p>Several residents in Litchfield County reported losing power after midnight and waking yesterday to find ice-covered roads and fallen tree branches and electrical lines.</p>
        <p>Katherine Goodhouse and her family made the most of the peace and quiet, but found themselves running out of things to do before 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>''We played board games and did crossword puzzles and stuff like that all day,'' she said. ''After a while, the board games become b-o-r-e-d games.'' Outside, it continued to rain, and the temperature hovered at just about the freezing point.</p>
        <p>Others ventured out. Maureen Mosca's family joined two others at a house with a generator. They cooked corn, ribs and chicken on the gas grill outside -- ''It beats a ham sandwich,'' Mrs. Mosca said. ''We're playing checkers. How's that? Drinking coffee and playing checkers.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Fayth Preis and her husband, Ronald, prepared a simple meal of franks, beans and soup on a grill atop their wood stove and invited neighbors for a candlelight dinner. She had taken a morning trip to the grocery store two miles away only to discover that all the D batteries -- the kind for most flashlights -- were sold out. Ms. Preis said rumor had it that it would be at least 48 hours before power was restored.</p>
        <p>There were reports of a large tree down and branches littering the historic Litchfield Green, which Ms. Preis described as ''sad to see.'' While sipping red wine with her guests around the stove, she said: ''There were tons of tree branches down. It was a mess.''</p>
        <p>At the Piperno house in Harwinton, no power meant no Sunday morning cartoons for the three school-age girls. But Jennifer Piperno, 11, was more concerned about her five horses, whose icy pasture was littered with branches. Despite treacherous roads, her family traveled to a guitar concert in West Hartford and went out to dinner. When they returned the power was still out. Her homework, however, had not moved.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Jennifer said. ''We're doing it anyway, by flashlight.''</p>
