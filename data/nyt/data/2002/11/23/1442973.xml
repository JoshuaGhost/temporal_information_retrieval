        <p>The New York City Schools Chancellor, Joel I. Klein, abruptly laid off about 70 mid- and high-level employees from Department of Education headquarters. The cuts were the first of 550 central administrative jobs that are being eliminated as part of a $200 million budget reduction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein announced the layoffs in an e-mail message to his central staff in the afternoon, as the weekend approached. Many people had thought the reductions would come through attrition, not layoffs. The 550 employees to be laid off make up about 21 percent of the school system's 2,616 central administrative workers, officials said.</p>

        <p>The layoffs, which will take place Jan. 2, are the second so far to affect public employees under the Bloomberg administration as it struggles to close a $1.1 billion budget gap. The Department of Sanitation dismissed 103 workers last month.</p>
