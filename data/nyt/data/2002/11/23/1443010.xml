        <p>Fortis, the DutchBelgian banking and insurance group, posted a worse-than-expected third-quarter loss of 1.61 billion euros. Anton van Rossum, left, the chairman, said that next year would also be difficult. ''The recovery is frustratingly slow,'' he said, adding that Fortis did not see a solid recovery until 2004. Weak stock prices in the quarter cost the bank 2 billion euros, it said, adding that the recent rebound in share prices has alleviated that loss. On Nov. 15, it was calculated at 1.5 billion euros.</p>
