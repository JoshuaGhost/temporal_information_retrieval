        <p>The former mayor of Providence, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., has been reassigned from a federal prison in Ohio to one at Fort Dix, N.J., so he can be nearer his daughter, who is battling drug addiction, and his two grandchildren. Mr. Cianci, 61, was sentenced to five years in prison this fall after being convicted of racketeering conspiracy in June. He is to report to prison on Dec. 6. The reassignment was requested by two Democratic congressmen from Rhode Islands, Representatives Patrick J. Kennedy and Jim Langevin.</p>
