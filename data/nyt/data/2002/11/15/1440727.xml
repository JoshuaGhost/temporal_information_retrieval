        <p>Kmart is calling its holiday ad campaign ''Give More Gifts, Spread More Cheer.'' At the same time, the retailer is showing less Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>A television spot that began appearing on Sunday features the holiday products at Kmart as part of its Martha Stewart Everyday line. The products, which include tree ornaments, wrapping paper and Christmas stockings in an array of themes and colors, are the first of their kind for Ms. Stewart, who generated about $1.5 billion worth of business for Kmart last year.</p>
        <p>But the ad does not feature Ms. Stewart, who has usually been front and center in the past. Instead, her voice is heard while a festive Santa Claus appears inside a snow globe on the screen, along with a fully decorated Christmas tree and examples of the products.</p>
        <p>This is the first visible sign that Kmart, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, may be trying to limit the association shoppers make between the store and Ms. Stewart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart is under investigation by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for her sale of nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems last December. She made the trade the day before an announcement that sent the price of ImClone plummeting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart has called her trade ''entirely lawful'' and said it took place because she and her stockbroker had earlier agreed to sell if the shares fell below a certain price.</p>
        <p>''They were counting on Stewart to be the workhorse for them,'' Robert K. Passikoff, president of Brand Keys, a Manhattan consulting firm that studies customer loyalty, said.</p>
        <p>He has found that Kmart's image declined as publicity about Ms. Stewart's legal troubles increased. ''It's very hard,'' he said. ''They've committed to the media, so they can't just sit and do nothing. So what you do is, you push the products without putting more of a face and a brand to it.''</p>
        <p>When Kmart sought bankruptcy protection last January, retaining Ms. Stewart was a priority because her allure was thought to be critical to reversing the company's fortunes. Kmart and Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have said they will continue their business arrangement as usual despite the investigation into Ms. Stewart, and both have said that sales of her products continue to be robust. At the same time, Kmart has reached out to other exclusive brands, notably Joe Boxer, to build interest in its stores.</p>
        <p>Two holiday ads for Joe Boxer feature Vaughn Lowery, the actor whose audition for a Joe Boxer ad last summer was so entertaining that Kmart rewrote its commercials around him. In one of the holiday ads, Mr. Lowery is shown dancing his trademark boogie, clad in a silver-wrapped holiday box, then a pair of red boxers. In the other, he is accompanied by several female dancers amid falling snow while he sticks his fingers over his head to suggest antlers, as on reindeer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowery, who became nationally known as a result of his first Joe Boxer ads, does not speak. But he is the face, dancing feet and attractive image of the brand, unaltered since he first became linked with Kmart.</p>
        <p>In the Martha Stewart ad, ''the featured performer is Santa,'' Dave Karraker, a spokesman for Kmart, said. The decision to use the jolly elf and not Ms. Stewart came about because Kmart wanted to focus on the products, not necessarily on decorating, which is closely affiliated with Ms. Stewart, he added. The investigation ''was not something that came into consideration,'' he said. ''We wanted what was best for the products, and what highlighted the products most accurately.''</p>
        <p>Sharon Patrick, the president of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said Ms. Stewart had appeared in all but 2 of the 26 television ads made for Kmart since 1997, including one that appeared in October for a white sale. She said she considered Ms. Stewart present in the current ad. ''There's no doubt it's Martha,'' she said. Gael Towey, the creative director of Martha Stewart Living, said the ad agency, the Arnell Group, had filmed Ms. Stewart for possible use inside the snow globe, instead of Santa.</p>
        <p>Last month, Martha Stewart Living said its third-quarter earnings fell 42 percent, in part because of higher expenses that have resulted from the investigation. Ms. Stewart, who has been notified by the S.E.C. that it intends to bring a complaint against her, remains the chairwoman and chief executive of the company. The company's third-quarter filing with the S.E.C. showed that it spent $2 million on legal fees and additional public relations related to the investigation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart has canceled the network holiday special that she has starred in for the last several years. Uncertainty stemming from the investigation, as well as the cost of producing the special, led to the decision, her company said last month.</p>
        <p>''I don't know whether she's guilty or not,'' Mr. Passikoff said. ''But rather than get tarred with the brand stick, I'd rather stay away, and so would they.''</p>
