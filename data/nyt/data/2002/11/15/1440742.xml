        <p>Shots With Schwarzenegger</p>
        <p>The Terminator is no ordinary museumgoer. He enters through the exit door. He has his photograph taken. And then, he leaves by the same back door.</p>
        <p>That was the way things would have gone when ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER dropped by the American Museum of Natural History's new Einstein exhibit on Wednesday. Except that DR. RUTH K. WESTHEIMER hijacked Mr. Schwarzenegger's photo op with the sculptor ROBERT BERKS, who was explaining his twice-life-size Einstein.</p>
        <p>Soon Mr. Schwarzenegger was sitting in Einstein's lap, and Mr. Berks's wife, TOD, was asking, ''Where did Dr. Ruth come from?'' Soon Dr. Ruth was sitting in Einstein's lap and kissing those bigger-than-big lips -- the statue's, not the Terminator's. Soon she and Mr. Schwarzenegger were speaking German and she was introducing FELIX POSEN, a retired metals trader who endowed a professorship in modern European Jewish history at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Westheimer, switching back to English, was talking strategy. ''When I see Schwarzenegger, I go right over,'' she said. ''I know I'm going to get kissed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Posen's son, DAN, was having none of it. ''I don't want to get kissed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>No Money for Him</p>
        <p>JACK DREYFUS, who was lionized on Wall Street as the founder of the Dreyfus Fund and among bridge enthusiasts for his shrewd playing in tough-money hands, made clear in a deposition released yesterday that he did not intend to share his estate with a 40-year-old Florida man claiming to be his son. Mr. Dreyfus stated in court papers that he had added a clause to his will that specifically excluded JERRY BROWN, the son of a former acquaintance, ''from taking any share of my estate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown had gone to State Supreme Court in Manhattan hoping to win an order for a DNA test. Mr. Dreyfus, 89, chided Mr. Brown in the court papers for waiting until his ''senior years'' to try to establish a relationship. Although Mr. Dreyfus acknowledged a relationship with Mr. Brown's mother, he said it ''did not result in her becoming pregnant.'' Mr. Brown's lawyer, ROBERT G. SMITH, said, ''Mr. Dreyfus protests too much.''</p>
        <p>Diva Plans to Bone Up</p>
        <p>It took three days to catch up with BEVERLY SILLS, to talk about the first day on her new job. She was that busy.</p>
        <p>A little history, please.</p>
        <p>She stepped down as chairwoman of Lincoln Center in May. Then she became chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera. ''The shortest retirement in history, no question about that,'' she said yesterday. ''There was such a look of relief on my daughter's face when I said I had been having discussions with the Metropolitan Opera. You never saw such a look of anticipation.''</p>
        <p>So on Monday, after her first day at the Met, she went to a book party for LOUIS V. GERSTNER and a dinner party for SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. All right, so had she read Mr. Gerstner's book? After all, he is on the board of Lincoln Center. ''I'll have to,'' she said, ''because he's going to call next week and ask questions. I know him. He's going to make me pass an oral exam. I'm going to take it to the country for the weekend.''</p>
        <p>Scorsese Pleads Ignorance</p>
        <p>Ralphie's dead? Who's Ralphie?</p>
        <p>It was news to MARTIN SCORSESE. (Ralphie was a character played by JOE PANTOLIANO on a mob soap opera. He was beaten in the episode being broadcast this week.)</p>
        <p>'' 'The Sopranos'? I've only seen one show, about three years ago,'' Mr. Scorsese said at a screening of ''Goodfellas'' that had been arranged by AMC, a cable TV channel. ''It's a wonderful concept, I think. But I really never got into the show because it's territory that I've already kind of expressed. We touch upon it a lot in 'Mean Streets.' We touch upon it in 'Raging Bull' a little bit with the mob activity in the 1940's in the fight racket. We deal with it completely in 'Goodfellas,' and we take it out West, like a crazy frontier western, in 'Casino.' So, each time, we sort of upped the ante. After that, I don't know of any Mafia activity of today. I only know the past -- I think I relate more to the past. So for me 'The Sopranos' -- as well done as it is -- are people that I don't necessarily know how to relate to.''</p>
        <p>And then there is that geographical thing.</p>
        <p>''It's New Jersey, too,'' he said as a crowd that included DAVID BLAINE, RITA MORENO and WOODY HARRELSON swirled by. ''They have trees. We had fire escapes.''</p>
