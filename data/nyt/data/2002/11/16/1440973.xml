        <p>North Babylon has always run the ball. The Bulldogs do not try to camouflage their game plan, and they even make it easier for opponents by running primarily to the right side of the line.</p>
        <p>''We're not tricking anybody,'' North Babylon Coach Terry Manning said. ''You better come to North Babylon with one thing in mind: you got to stop our run.''</p>

        <p>North Babylon has a history of producing good backs. This season, the sophomore Jason Gwaltney has emerged as one of the best backs on Long Island and has led the 8-0 Bulldogs with 1,402 yards and 25 touchdowns.</p>

        <p>North Babylon has always run the ball. The Bulldogs do not try to camouflage their game plan, and they even make it easier for opponents by running primarily to the right side of the line.</p>
        <p>''We're not tricking anybody,'' North Babylon Coach Terry Manning said. ''You better come to North Babylon with one thing in mind: you got to stop our run.''</p>
        <p>So far this season no one has. The Bulldogs, 8-0 going into the first round of the Suffolk County Division II playoffs, face Northport (5-3) this afternoon. In the last five seasons, North Babylon has played in the Long Island championship four times and has won three titles. Last season, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion, Bellport.</p>
        <p>North Babylon has a history of producing good backs. Ian Smart, who last week set the N.C.A.A. Division II record with his 90th career touchdown at C. W. Post, was not even the featured back when he played at North Babylon. Barry Baker, who is now at Syracuse, carried the ball 30 times a game and Smart was primarily a second option.</p>
        <p>This season, the sophomore Jason Gwaltney has emerged as one of the best backs on Long Island and has led the Bulldogs with 1,402 yards and 25 touchdowns in 8 games. Although Gwaltney has had great individual success, Manning said the offensive line had not only opened holes for Gwaltney, but had also kept him grounded.</p>
        <p>''Any good running back knows where his bread is being buttered,'' Manning said of Gwaltney's relationship with his linemen. ''Jason is a 15-year-old cocky kid and they keep him in his place.''</p>
        <p>The leader of the offensive line is Larkin Mayberry. Mayberry, who also plays inside linebacker and leads the defense with 92 tackles -- 30 for losses -- plays right guard on offense. Because the Bulldogs like to run the ball to the right side, Mayberry, right tackle Joe Gonzalez and tight end Rob Wilcox are among the most valuable players on the team.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows we're running to the right side,'' Mayberry said. ''We can hear them yelling at the line of scrimmage, 'It's going to the six-hole.' They're right, but we still run over them and get our yards.''</p>
        <p>Manning knows that the linemen do not often get the credit they deserve, but he also knows that it does not take much to make them happy.</p>
        <p>''They're overworked and underappreciated,'' he said. ''But we'll give them a couple of stickers for their helmets and let them eat first at the buffet and they're pretty happy.''</p>
        <p>Mayberry and the rest of the line think of eating first as a reward for the work they put into every game.</p>
        <p>''Coach Manning knows we hit and get hit on every play, but we're never in the newspapers,'' Mayberry said. ''So he says to us, 'As long as I'm around, you'll always eat first.' ''</p>
