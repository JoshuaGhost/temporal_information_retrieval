        <p>They are weary, broken creatures, these survivors of Thebes, stooped in the postures of people long accustomed to ducking the blows of war and of tyrants.

But they are always, always around, huddling in protective clusters and murmuring with the fear and wisdom that comes from witnessing lives destroyed.</p>
        <p>So appear the more than a dozen men who make up the chorus in the National Theater of Greece's splendid and severe new production of Sophocles's ''Antigone,'' which runs through this weekend at City Center.

        <p>They are weary, broken creatures, these survivors of Thebes, stooped in the postures of people long accustomed to ducking the blows of war and of tyrants. Dressed in shades of gray, they seem at moments on the verge of blending altogether into the shadows. But they are always, always around, huddling in protective clusters and murmuring with the fear and wisdom that comes from witnessing lives destroyed.</p>
        <p>So appear the more than a dozen men who make up the chorus in the National Theater of Greece's splendid and severe new production of Sophocles's ''Antigone,'' which runs through this weekend at City Center. T. S. Eliot would write about the modern descendants of such figures more than 2,000 years after they first appeared on a stage, beings of ''shape without form, shade without color,/ Paralyzed force, gesture without motion.''</p>
        <p>You recognize them from your daily life, too, of course, since they are invariably found in places where people congregate in herds: on the floors of Congress and the Stock Exchange, in office cafeterias and shopping malls. There is a reason that Niketi Kontouri, the insightful director of this ''Antigone,'' has her chorus members emerge from the audience to ascend the stage. They are so very like us.</p>
        <p>The chorus is not the star of this penetrating interpretation of Sophocles's tragedy of individual conscience and public law. That distinction is shared, with grand style and emotional ferocity, by Lydia Koniordou and Sophoclis Peppas as the willful heroine of the title and her uncle, Creon, the king who condemns her to death.</p>
        <p>It is nonetheless the chorus that here becomes the defining element of ''Antigone,'' the ordinary mass against which the extraordinary few flare briefly before dying for sins that others were not bold enough to commit. Like Deborah Warner, in her recent production of Euripides's ''Medea,'' Ms. Kontouri has thrillingly revitalized the dialogue between the passive chorus and the active characters that is the spine of so much Greek tragedy.</p>
        <p>In doing so, she seems to draw you directly onto the stage, into uncomfortably close proximity to the bloody events unfolding, and to force you into identifying with these uneasy hollow men, whose instinct before violent displays of emotion is divided between the urges to stare and to turn their heads.</p>
        <p>Not that your eyes are likely to stray from this intermissionless, 110-minute production, other than to check out the English translations (of a modern Greek text) projected in supertitles. Ms. Kontouri and her fine-handed technical team have created a seamless piece of work that holds you in hypnotized, if sometimes uncomfortable, captivity.</p>
        <p>The first play that Sophocles wrote in his dynastic trilogy of the House of Oedipus (the others are ''Oedipus Rex'' and ''Oedipus at Colonus''), it in fact portrays the final chapter in the family's misfortunes. Oedipus is dead when the play begins, but the taint of his curse lingers. His sons have slain each other in battle, and his daughter Antigone will court death in trying to bury one of them, who fought against Thebes and whose body has been denied funeral rites by Creon.</p>
        <p>Antigone's defiance of Creon has exerted a particular hold on audiences in times of oppression. (Jean Anouilh's version was written during World War II as an allegory of the Vichy government.) And you can see why -- more than the usual tragic heroes -- Antigone appeals to students who are forced to dip into classical literature. She is a radiant rebel with a cause, standing up to the establishment with both thin-skinned sensitivity and an obdurate sense of right.</p>
        <p>The ravishing, raven-haired Ms. Koniordou, seen here six years ago as Elektra, captures every scintilla of this appeal, blazing with a conviction and ardor that comes only with youth. Lefteris Pavlopoulos's subtly graded lighting enhances her incandescence, and you understand on a sensory level why the gray men of the chorus are so rattled by her presence.</p>
        <p>Of course, Creon would spot danger in a woman described, aptly if awkwardly (in the supertitles), as ''the glimmer that lit the last blossom of the house of Oedipus.'' Yet this Antigone is no pure force of light. In a transfixingly focused performance, Ms. Koniordou elicits the frightening obsessiveness in Antigone's lust for martyrdom.</p>
        <p>She brings to mind the beautiful, politically committed girls you may have known in college, the ones who seemed to live with such intense single-mindedness that you were equally drawn to and repelled by them. There is a masochistic fever in Ms. Koniordou's eyes when Antigone describes her legacy of horror and shame.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Peppas's Creon, who knows he must always woo the masses the chorus represents, is not just a stony tyrant, though he looks like a silver-toned Stalin. When first seen onstage, there is fatigue in his voice, which builds in strength as he recites his principles of leadership, as if they were mantras.</p>
        <p>This is a man for whom strength is willed, not natural. In the face of the horrific losses he brings upon himself, he crumbles into a yowl of pain that directly echoes that of Oedipus. Classical scholars have long debated the idea that Creon, not Antigone, is the play's cathartic center, repeating the fall of Oedipus. Mr. Peppas's anguished performance gives the argument force.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kontouri, however, refuses to tilt the balance toward one character. More than any production of a Greek tragedy I have seen, this ''Antigone'' never emphasizes the individual at the expense of the cosmic canvas. Each of the other principals in the cast, all vividly and completely embodied, is given full due in the play's governing pattern of loss and pain, from Antigone's passionately ambivalent sister, Ismene (Maria Katsiadaki), to the doomed Haemon (Nikos Arvanitis), Antigone's fierce love and Creon's son.</p>
        <p>Yorgos Patsas's modernistically spare set and costumes, accented by ancient accouterments of war, suggest an eternal world framed harshly by mortality. The same sense of inexorable time is picked up by Takis Farazis's percussive music and Vasso Barboussi's meticulously varied choreography of the chorus.</p>
        <p>There are, throughout, stunning coups de théâtre, achieved with elegant simplicity: the disturbing emergence of the prophet Tiresias (Kosmas Fondoukis) from a seemingly uninhabited blanket in a wheelchair; the proud, grief-crippled gait of Eurydice (Miranta Zafiropoulou), Creon's queen, as she walks away after learning of her son's death.</p>
        <p>One particular gesture is memorably shared and repeated by Antigone and Creon. It is a stark, reflexive and heartrbreaking movement, in which they suddenly shelter the tops of their heads with their hands, as if to fend off the next assault from above.</p>
        <p>It is a futile gesture, and their hope-stripped faces register its inadequacy. The men of the chorus could have told them -- as they repeatedly tell the audience -- that such resistence is ultimately in vain. These, of course, are men who never raise their heads to the skies in defiance. That is why they are still standing at the play's end.</p>
