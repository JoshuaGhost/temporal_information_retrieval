      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron, was indicted by a grand jury in Houston yesterday on 78 counts of fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.</p>
        <p>The indictment -- which closely mirrors the charges in a criminal complaint against Mr. Fastow filed in early October -- is the first to be brought against an Enron executive since that company collapsed last year amid an accounting scandal.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Mr. Fastow conspired with others inside and outside of Enron to use a series of off-the-books partnerships to disguise the company's true financial performance, manipulate its stock and divert corporate cash into his pocket.</p>
        <p>In addition, in a new accusation raised in the indictment, Mr. Fastow was charged with obstruction of justice for trying to persuade an Enron colleague to hide and destroy records related to the transactions in order to keep them from government investigators.</p>
        <p>John W. Keker, a lawyer for Mr. Fastow, criticized the charges yesterday as failing to tell the full story of what happened at Enron -- a story that, he contends, will lead to his client's exoneration.</p>
        <p>''These charges are full of sound and fury, but the truth about Enron has yet to be told,'' Mr. Keker said in the statement. ''When the truth is told to a jury of 12 honest Americans, Andy Fastow will be set free.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Keker has stated in the past that he will not disclose Mr. Fastow's side of the story until the case against his client goes to trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fastow, 40, is free on a $5 million bond; yesterday's indictment did not require him to appear in court immediately, but he is expected to be arraigned on the charges in a few days before a federal magistrate judge in Houston.</p>
        <p>While most of the charges have been raised by the government in the past, the sheer volume of the accusations against Mr. Fastow was unusual, reflecting the belief of prosecutors that the former chief financial officer played a central role in the collapse of Enron.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, the criminal scheme between Mr. Fastow and others inside and outside of Enron began in 1997 and lasted through the fall of last year. During that time, Mr. Fastow and others in Enron management used the off-the-books partnerships, known as ''special purpose vehicles,'' as a virtual dumping ground for both bad assets and debts.</p>
        <p>But, in shifting those assets to the partnerships, the indictment contends, Enron also generated bogus income and cash flow, making the company appear far more successful than it was.</p>
        <p>At least one of the partnerships, known as RADR, was used by Mr. Fastow to circumvent regulatory requirements, the indictment contends. In that March 1997 transaction, Enron appeared to divest itself of an interest in some wind farms, which for regulatory reasons could no longer qualify for certain government benefits if the company continued to own them.</p>
        <p>Enron could only meet regulatory requirements if it sold the wind farms to an independent party. In the RADR transaction, the indictment contends, Enron effectively sold the farms to itself, secretly retaining control of them.</p>
        <p>The equity for the transaction was provided by Mr. Fastow to a group of investors, who in turn funneled cash from the partnership back to him, the indictment contends.</p>
        <p>In other partnership transactions, the indictment states, Mr. Fastow took kickbacks from Michael J. Kopper, another former Enron executive. Those kickbacks were often disguised as gifts, and were paid in a group of $10,000 checks made out to Mr. Fastow's wife and children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, along with other conspirators, also structured deals to trick Enron and a bank that invested in a partnership into relinquishing $19 million that rightfully belonged to the companies, the indictment contends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kopper pleaded guilty to two felonies in August, and is a prime witness against Mr. Fastow in the criminal case.</p>
