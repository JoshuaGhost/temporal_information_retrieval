        <p>Nine teenagers were arrested yesterday after an underground melee involving a large group of students from the Humanities Preparatory Academy on West 18th Street, the police said. About 3:20 p.m., a 17-year-old boy was slashed during a fight at the 50th Street and Eighth Avenue subway station, and four teenagers who had been traveling north on the C train were arrested, the police said. The boy was taken to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital with minor injuries and was later released, the police said. At the 59th Street and Eighth Avenue station, five more teenagers were arrested, and a sergeant and three police officers suffered minor injuries. All but one of the suspects were girls, and all except one juvenile were charged with disorderly conduct, inciting a riot and rioting.</p>
