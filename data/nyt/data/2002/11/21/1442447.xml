        <p>Citing concerns about freedom of speech, Harvard University's English department has renewed an invitation to the Irish poet Tom Paulin to give a lecture, just a week after he was disinvited for expressing strongly anti-Israeli views.</p>
        <p>The new invitation, approved in a vote on Tuesday night, drew sharply differing responses from faculty members and students at Harvard, which has been troubled by heated debates and demonstrations about Israel in the past year. Some expressed relief, saying the university had crossed the line by disinviting a poet because of his political views. Others were outraged and said the decision would lead to renewed protests.</p>

        <p>Citing concerns about freedom of speech, Harvard University's English department has renewed an invitation to the Irish poet Tom Paulin to give a lecture, just a week after he was disinvited for expressing strongly anti-Israeli views.</p>
        <p>The new invitation, approved in a vote on Tuesday night, drew sharply differing responses from faculty members and students at Harvard, which has been troubled by heated debates and demonstrations about Israel in the past year. Some expressed relief, saying the university had crossed the line by disinviting a poet because of his political views. Others were outraged and said the decision would lead to renewed protests.</p>
        <p>''I hope that those who choose to attend the planned reading will respect the rights of those who wish to hear the speaker,'' Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, said yesterday in a statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paulin's invitation was rescinded on Nov. 12 after students, faculty members and alumni expressed outrage about comments Mr. Paulin made to an Egyptian newspaper in April. He said that Brooklyn-born Jews who had settled in the West Bank ''should be shot dead,'' adding ''I think they are Nazis, racists; I feel nothing but hatred for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paulin did not respond to messages left at Columbia University, where he is a visiting faculty member this fall, but he has said that his views have been distorted and that he does not support attacks on Israeli citizens under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers released an approving statement after the invitation was rescinded. But the decision to disinvite Mr. Paulin prompted a rebuke from three professors at Harvard Law School: Alan M. Dershowitz, Laurence H. Tribe and Charles Fried.</p>
        <p>In a joint letter published in The Harvard Crimson, they wrote that rescinding the invitation simply because it would be divisive was a ''truly dangerous'' precedent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paulin is likely to accept the invitation, said James Shapiro, a professor at Columbia who knows him.</p>
        <p>Faculty members at Harvard expressed a variety of responses to the English department's decision.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of a university is to see a variety of points of view,'' said Patrick Cavanagh, a psychology professor who signed a petition calling for Harvard to divest from companies doing business in Israel. ''Here's a man who's a wonderful poet, and if his politics are more controversial, that's really beside the point.''</p>
        <p>Jay M. Harris, a professor of Jewish studies, called the invitation unconscionable. ''Nobody is stopping him from exercising his First Amendment rights,'' he said. ''But an invitation from Harvard is different. We wouldn't invite David Duke to speak.''</p>
        <p>For some, Mr. Paulin's political statements is complicated by his history of linking literature and politics. Mr. Paulin, who grew up in Belfast, has criticized the poet Philip Larkin as racist, and in a review several years ago wrote approvingly of a book that criticized T. S. Eliot as anti-Semitic.</p>
        <p>For some of Mr. Paulin's defenders, remarks like that prove that his rhetorical attacks on Israel are not anti-Semitic. Others say Mr. Paulin had simply invoked a standard that could and should be used against him.</p>
        <p>''You can't say both things at the same time without there being a paradox,'' said Rita Goldberg, a lecturer on literature at Harvard, referring to Mr. Paulin's earlier critiques of anti-Semitism and his comments about Israel.</p>
