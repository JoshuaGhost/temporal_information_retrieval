        <p>The missile attack on an Israeli passenger plane flying from Kenya today was a stark warning that another long-feared threat may be on the rise: terrorists shooting down commercial aircraft with shoulder-fired missiles designed for battlefield attacks on swift combat jets.</p>
        <p>Hundreds if not thousands of the relatively cheap but highly lethal missiles are believed to be circulating on the black market, and they already have been used with deadly accuracy against civilian planes in a number of overseas war zones.</p>
        <p>The fact that the Arkia airlines plane escaped what witnesses described as a pair of missiles did not diminish the worry. The 261 passengers aboard the Boeing 757-300 were saved, experts said, either by the inexperience of the attackers or a missile technical failure -- or by luck.</p>
        <p>''This has been a major concern for a number of years,'' said Daniel Benjamin, who was a senior counterterrorism adviser to President Clinton. ''Recognizing that there are so many of this type of missile out there, and with today's attack as a manifestation that there are terrorists who would truly like to shoot down civilian airliners, we have to understand that the threat has now gone up.''</p>
        <p>Although published statistics on the number of shoulder-fired missile attacks against commercial aircraft vary, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said there have been at least 29 instances in which civilian planes have been hit by these weapons, mostly in war zones, causing at least 550 deaths.</p>
        <p>The United States government has studied the threat to commercial airline traffic from light, portable missiles and has discussed its concerns with airline executives, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Just this past summer, American officials elevated warnings of terrorist attack from shoulder-launched missiles.</p>
        <p>American military officials announced in June that a Sudanese man with possible ties to Al Qaeda was arrested in Sudan, and that he had admitted launching a Soviet-designed SA-7 shoulder-fired missile at an American warplane in Saudi Arabia late last year. The missile did not strike the jet.</p>
        <p>But the discovery of the empty missile canister prompted an F.B.I. alert that terrorists might try to shoot down a commercial aircraft with shoulder-fired missiles.</p>
        <p>In Israel today, investigators said the attackers in Kenya apparently used a version of the SA-7, originally designed in the 1970's and later copied for manufacture by China, Yugoslavia, Egypt and Pakistan, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>It is similar to an early portable missile developed for the American military, the Redeye, which zeroes in on the heat from an aircraft's engines, according to a Pentagon official.</p>
        <p>Missiles like the SA-7 can overtake planes traveling at the speed of sound and up to an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet, the official said. Compared with the high-performance combat jets or dizzyingly maneuverable attack helicopters the missile was designed to down, a lumbering passenger plane taking off is considered an easy target.</p>
        <p>The SA-7 is not as capable as the newer American Stinger, which proved devastating against Soviet aircraft during Moscow's failed occupation of Afghanistan. In fact, the threat of leftover Stingers in Afghanistan was so great that the Central Intelligence Agency offered to pay hefty bounties to anyone who would return one of the missiles during the American-led campaign to topple the Taliban and rout Al Qaeda there.</p>
        <p>American military officials said their forces in Afghanistan found many caches of Chinese- and Russian-made SA-7 missiles during sweeps throughout the country. One Pentagon official said today that the administration has evidence that Al Qaeda trained with shoulder-fired missiles; the official also said the government had indications that the terrorist network planned to position those weapons around the globe.</p>
        <p>Military aircraft and passenger planes used by countries' leaders -- and wealthy executives -- often are outfitted with flares, metallic confetti or chemical powders to draw missiles away from their targets. But the cost to commercial airlines to arm every plane with such countermeasures would be high, and possibly prohibitive given the struggle for profits since the Sept. 11 hijacking attacks.</p>
        <p>The threat of possible missile or jet attack also was noted today by the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad, which said it had received ''unverified reports of what appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin in the vicinity of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean'' on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the command said commercial airline pilots reported seeing the contrail, a vapor trail left by high-flying objects, heading northwest toward the United States, with subsequent sightings over Florida and later over Indiana.</p>
        <p>''Norad scrambled fighter aircraft from several bases in an attempt to intercept and identify the source of the contrail,'' the statement said. ''No visual or confirmed radar contact was made with the source of the contrail.''</p>
