        <p>Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, says his department is still reviewing a policy on whether and how to expand the artificial reef system along the state's Atlantic Ocean coast. He said that a preliminary report indicating that the state would expand the reefs was erroneously made public last week and that he had ordered it taken off the department's Web site. ''Everyone on both sides of the issue wants us to have a policy about artificial reefs, so we want to take more time to decide what it is,'' he said. ''Recently there has been a significant amount of new data that we have not fully processed and, so, we're deferring any report until we do.'' The commercial and recreation fishing businesses are especially anxious to enhance the offshore reefs because they feel they would attract more fish. Environmentalists tend to be more wary, especially about using certain materials to enhance the reefs.</p>
