        <p>James Thurber once said, ''It is better to ask some of the questions than to know all the answers.''</p>
        <p>But were Thurber still alive, perhaps even he would long to know why his philosophical ponderings have joined those of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Alexandre Dumas fils and Ambrose Bierce on a series of 10-foot-tall windows of the former Barney's on the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 17th Street.</p>
        <p>Since July, the windows of the building, which gained a modicum of fame when it served as the fictional megastore Fox Books in Nora Ephron's 1998 film ''You've Got Mail,'' have been covered in vinyl screens of red, yellow and green and imprinted with nine famous quotations spanning the globe and the centuries. No signs point to the building's current owner -- or intention.</p>
        <p>Gertrude Stein is no help. Her panel reads: ''There ain't no answer. There ain't going to be any answer. There never has been an answer. That's the answer.''</p>
        <p>But a man in a green cap who was sitting on a nearby planter reading ''The Game of the Foxes,'' had a clue; he said the windows were rumored to hide a private collection of Tibetan art. And Abdul Ramen Diup, who sells billfolds on the corner, suggested that the windows themselves might be art, since many tourists have posed in front of them them in recent months.</p>
        <p>''I can't read English yet, but the colors are so pretty,'' said Mr. Diup, a Senegal native who has been working the corner since June. ''The words must be pretty, too, because every day people stop to read them.''</p>
        <p>Both men were right. The 70,000-square-foot structure is owned by Donald Rubin, a New York insurance magnate who is renovating part of the space to showcase his 1,500-piece collection of Himalayan art. The Rubin Museum of Art, which is being designed by Richard Blinder of the New York firm Beyer Blinder Belle, is expected to open in March 2004.</p>
        <p>And the mysterious quotations? Milton Glaser of ''I</p>
        <p>NY'' fame, the head of graphics for the planned museum, came up with the idea after some local residents complained about too much unsightly construction in their neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''Since the museum will reflect Buddhist thought, I thought it might be amusing to put up some provocative or ironic ideas in the windows,'' he said. ''That Stein quote could come right out of a Buddhist text, if you think about it.''</p>
