        <p>The race for the Congressional seat in Maryland's Eighth District has touched on the usual kitchen-table fare of health care and taxes. But it really revolves around a single vote -- the one that the Republican incumbent, Constance A. Morella, casts every two years for her party's leaders in the House.</p>
        <p>In the fight for the most Democratic district in the nation now represented by a Republican, the Democratic challenger, Christopher Van Hollen, is seeking to persuade voters in Maryland's Eighth District, in Washington's suburbs, that Mrs. Morella's moderate record is no compensation for her role in keeping conservative Republicans in charge of the House.</p>
        <p>''The Republican leadership is so out of step with the people of this district,'' said Mr. Van Hollen, 43, a state senator. ''The first vote that Representative Morella casts for that leadership guarantees they are not going to make progress on the very things she says she cares about.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Morella, 71, who is running for a ninth term, said in a radio debate today that she would indeed vote for the speaker candidate nominated by her party's caucus. But she said the district would be better served by retaining her as a centrist pipeline to the offices of President Bush and Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker, rather than tossing her out in a vain hope of overthrowing the Republicans.</p>
        <p>''Democrats are not going to get the majority,'' she said after she and Mr. Van Hollen simultaneously worked a luncheon of retired teachers in Montgomery County, the affluent area at the center of the district. ''It is not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>She then asked, ''Wouldn't it be more effective for you, your own special interests, if you had somebody who has access to the president, who has access with the leadership of the majority?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Van Hollen, who has 12 years in the State Legislature and defeated Mark Shriver, a Kennedy family member, in a tough primary, is the most seasoned challenger Mrs. Morella has faced.</p>
        <p>In 2000, Al Gore carried the district with about 65 percent of the vote in what would become the new district. And after the 2000 census, the Legislature made things even harder for her by adding still more Democrats to the district and removing some who had grown accustomed to voting for her -- a fact she raises often at campaign appearances.</p>
        <p>But despite the party label, she remains popular among Democrats in the area, many of whom can cite personal stories of how she has helped them. Analysts say Mr. Van Hollen faces a difficult task in trying to break that emotional attachment.</p>
        <p>Charles Dusterhoff, one of the teachers at the session, is a registered Democrat. But he recounted how Mrs. Morella helped him with a Social Security issue, and added that the question of who leads the House was not enough to change his vote. ''This is an important election for Democrats, I know,'' he said, ''but she has worked hard for me and I will keep going for her.''</p>
        <p>Polls show the race to be very tight. A recent survey by The Baltimore Sun gave Mrs. Morella a slight edge after she ran a series of advertisements attacking her opponent. As in so many races around the country, turnout will determine the outcome, with Mr. Van Hollen likely to benefit if it is high.</p>
        <p>The two candidates agree on many major issues, including abortion rights and gun control, but there are differences that Mr. Van Hollen likes to point out. He faults Mrs. Morella for her votes for a Republican plan for prescription drug coverage for older Americans, President Bush's 2001 tax cut and a corporate reform measure in the House that was not as tough as the one ultimately passed.</p>
        <p>The district was also in the middle of the sniper killings, which traumatized the region and dampened the campaign for more than two weeks. It also revived gun control as an issue. Though both candidates back restrictions, Mr. Van Hollen noted that the House leadership did not feel the same way. ''It is one thing to say you are for gun control,'' he said. ''It is another thing to make sure you get the gun control agenda through.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Morella, who is receiving substantial help in her campaign from the Republican Party, sought to turn the tables on Mr. Van Hollen in one commercial, noting his support for a legislative plan to cut income taxes. ''To hear him talk, you'd think this guy was the Republican,'' the advertisement said.</p>
        <p>In her newest commercial, she speaks directly into the camera and encourages voters ''to place principle above partisanship.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Morella says she has done what she can to hold her seat. ''The people have entrusted me for 16 years with the responsibility of making decisions that affect their lives,'' she said. ''Now I have reached the point where I trust them.''</p>
