        <p>Making History</p>
        <p>An opera based on the only African-American who traveled with the 8,000-mile Lewis and Clark expedition of 1803-6, which mapped the way west, will have its world premiere at 7:30 tonight on the University Park, Pa., campus of Pennsylvania State University. With music by Bruce Trinkley and a libretto by J. Jason Charnesky, who teach at the university, ''York: The Voice of Freedom'' is to be presented again on Friday and Saturday by Penn State Opera Theater in conjunction with a multidisciplinary conference, ''Lewis and Clark: The Unheard Voices.'' The opera tells the story of York, Clark's slave, who took part in the journey as an equal member. But when the expedition ended and every other man received double pay and double land grants from the United States, York alone received nothing but a return to slavery. The opera follows his struggle to gain freedom.</p>

        <p>Teddy</p>
        <p>From the streets of New York to the Dakota Badlands. From San Juan Hill to the bully pulpit in the White House. So goes (in part), the life of Theodore Roosevelt (below), writer, historian, explorer, hunter, conservationist, scholar, politician, trust buster, winner of the Nobel Prize for peace and the Medal of Honor. This big subject gets a big exhibition beginning on Sunday, when ''The World of Theodore Roosevelt'' opens at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor, N.Y. Continuing through Feb. 16, this show explores the life of the 26th president through memorabilia, documents, furnishings, fashions and art, including works by Frederic Remington, Charles Russell, Albert Bierstadt, Augustus Saint-Gaudens and John Sloan.</p>
        <p>Making 'Em Laugh</p>
        <p>On any valid list of best movie musicals, ''Singin' in the Rain'' will be found, often at the top. Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly (right) from a screenplay by Adolph Green and Betty Comden built around songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, this classic is a movie about movies in the days when movies were learning to talk. Now ''Singin' in the Rain,'' which starred Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Donald O'Connor and Cyd Charisse, has reached the age of 50, and Film Forum is celebrating by bringing it back from tomorrow through Nov. 21. What's novel is that ''Singin' in the Rain'' will be seen in a new print and heard for the first time in Dolby digital stereo.</p>
        <p>Laurels</p>
        <p>Billy Crystal was named yesterday as the recipient of the 2003 Salute of the American Museum of the Moving Image. It is to be presented on Feb. 13 in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. . . . Clint Eastwood is to receive the Screen Actors Guild's 2002 Life Achievement Award at ceremonies on March 9.</p>
