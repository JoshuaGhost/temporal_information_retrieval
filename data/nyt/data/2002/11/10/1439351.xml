        <p>AT some point, it will become clear that Portugal, though not strictly Mediterranean, has regional cuisine just like Italy, France and Spain, and we will undoubtedly begin to understand the subtleties involved in it. It might even become trendy. But at the moment, Portuguese food is the poor stepchild of Western Europe.</p>
        <p>There is only one upscale Portuguese restaurant I know of -- it is in TriBeCa -- but it does not measure up to the mom-and-pop places that dot the cities of New England's south coast.</p>

        <p>AT some point, it will become clear that Portugal, though not strictly Mediterranean, has regional cuisine just like Italy, France and Spain, and we will undoubtedly begin to understand the subtleties involved in it. It might even become trendy. But at the moment, Portuguese food is the poor stepchild of Western Europe.</p>
        <p>There is only one upscale Portuguese restaurant I know of -- it is in TriBeCa -- but it does not measure up to the mom-and-pop places that dot the cities of New England's south coast.</p>
        <p>Among these is Omanel, a venerable restaurant just off Route 8 in Bridgeport, and it is one of the best.</p>
        <p>Omanel is a restaurant and bar separated by a wall. The d√©cor is familiar and chintzy but reasonably comfortable: green, pink and white. There are about 20 tables, with tablecloths, cloth napkins and roses on them.</p>
        <p>The service, usually provided by a single, extremely pleasant and efficient waiter, is better than you would expect. Fortunately for him, the place seldom becomes overwhelmingly busy.</p>
        <p>If there is nothing notable in the atmosphere, there is nothing deplorable; it is not a showcase but a family restaurant.</p>
        <p>The food can blow you away: some of it is so good, and so inexpensive, that you may wonder why you would ever go back to one of the places with the $1.5 million design scheme down the road in Fairfield.</p>
        <p>Omanel's menu sports real winners, and the specials change twice a day -- they are different at lunch and dinner -- so it is literally impossible to keep up with them. But they are always interesting and always well executed. Even if they were not, the standard menu has fine choices.</p>
        <p>For starters, there is garlic soup, made with bread (Portuguese rolls) and a poached egg, lightly spiced with chilies. It is actually less garlicky than many of the other dishes. There are times when you do not feel like the judicious use of garlic is sufficient; it is at times like these you should head to Omanel.</p>
        <p>Steamed clams, for example, is a garlic feast, a dozen or so hard shells in white wine, parsley, lemon and a couple of tablespoons of minced garlic. Those served ''Portuguese style'' feature tomato, bacon and linguica, and are also worth trying.</p>
        <p>You could order either of these, eat them with a couple of rolls, and leave happy (but you won't). Grilled quail in a spicy olive oil sauce is another good appetizer choice, as is the ludicrously generous pork and shrimp, which is big enough for a main course or a shared appetizer for four. It includes crisp chunks of seared tender pork, dotted with shrimp and, of course, garlic, with just enough sauce to wet your bread.</p>
        <p>The main courses are huge (you will take food home). Tilefish browned then stewed in tomatoes, onions and garlic is a winner; a rabbit stew offered as a special recently was prepared similarly. The grilled fish -- one night it was red snapper, another sea bass -- is consistently fine.</p>
        <p>There are a few seafood combinations, a couple on the menu and, usually, one or two specials, that are similar: bouillabaisse-like affairs with lobster, scallops, shrimp and mussels. If they are unremarkable, they are still as good as those served for twice the price elsewhere in the state. Fried codfish (it is salt cod, but not overwhelmingly salty) is done in an eggy batter, and done well. Grilled lamb ribs, a special one night, turned out to be a rack of lamb, perfectly medium-rare.</p>
        <p>My enthusiasm for Omanel might indicate that I believe that it is exceptional, but in many ways it is not. As in most Portuguese restaurants, starch is a strong point, vegetables a weak one. You will get a little pickled carrots or cauliflower on some dishes, or a few olives, or maybe some tomato slices, but not much else.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you will get tasty potatoes, whether boiled, roasted, or fried (the boiled ones will surprise you with their flavor), or a decent rice dish.</p>
        <p>The best desserts are flan and chocolate mousse; both come topped with Reddi-Whip. The wine list is inexpensive and decent, but not impressive.</p>
        <p>But at a time when corporate restaurants with predictable (read: contemporary Italian) menus are taking over, places like Omanel are more than they once were.</p>
        <p>They have long been honest, inexpensive and decent. Now they represent a kind of restaurant that is becoming less common -- perhaps even disappearing, at least in Connecticut -- and is therefore more precious than ever. I suggest you go, and I wager you will return.</p>
        <p>Omanel  1909 Main Street, Bridgeport  (203) 335-1676</p>
