        <p>Last week, ''Rudy!,'' an unauthorized biographical movie about the city's previous mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, began shooting on the mean streets of Montreal.</p>

        <p>There is no place like New York City -- except maybe Canada.</p>
        <p>Last week, ''Rudy!,'' an unauthorized biographical movie about the city's previous mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, began shooting on the mean streets of Montreal.</p>
        <p>Eh?</p>
        <p>''I guess they are going to show him watching baseball games at the Skydome or eating pommes frites, rather than eating at Patsy's,'' Representative Anthony Weiner, a Democrat who represents portions of Brooklyn and Queens, said Wednesday. He was speaking at a rally on the steps of City Hall, where members of the Screen Actors Guild and other film industry unions joined him to call for new federal tax credits to encourage American filmmakers to make their movies at home.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is going to be talking with that weird accent,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''Rudy!,'' which is scheduled to be shown on USA Network early next year, is based on Wayne Barrett's unauthorized biography of Mr. Giuliani. The movie begins with 9/11, then goes into a series of flashbacks about Mr. Giuliani's private life, trysts and all, and his rise to political power. James Woods stars as the mayor and Penelope Ann Miller plays Donna Hanover, his wife.</p>
        <p>''It is unheard of that anything about Rudy Giuliani should be done in Canada,'' said Jim Hovey, the Eastern regional director of Local 600, the cinematographers' guild.</p>
        <p>But, according to USA Network, New York will get at least a cameo role in ''Rudy!'' ''We are paying a premium to do that,'' a network spokeswoman said, ''and we do support any efforts that would make production in the U.S. more economically feasible.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani declined to comment. But a source close to him said, ''Shooting this in Montreal will speak to the authenticity.''</p>
        <p>Authentic or not, Canada is unquestionably, a cheaper place to make movies than New York, and ''Rudy!'' has struck a new nerve in an old debate.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Canadian government instituted a tax credit, equal to 11 percent of labor costs, to encourage film and video production. Several provinces, including Quebec, offer additional subsidies, which allow United States producers to save 22 percent or more on wages. Throw in a weak Canadian dollar and, voilà: money now migrates north like geese in spring.</p>
        <p>New York has been hit particularly hard by the change. From 1999 to 2001, feature film spending in the state plummeted to $167 million from $695 million, while spending in Canada rose to $1 billion, up from $413 million. According to some estimates, Canadian subsidies have cost New York nearly 11,000 jobs and $26 million in local tax revenue.</p>
        <p>Canadians won't take the blame.</p>
        <p>''Incentives of various forms are used in many jurisdictions, including plenty in the United States,'' said Peter Lloyd, who heads political and economic relations at the Consulate General of Canada in New York.</p>
        <p>''This company called USA Network should be true to its name and employ people here in the United States of America,'' Representative Weiner said.</p>
