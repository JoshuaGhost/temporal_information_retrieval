        <p>A SECRET HISTORY</p>
        <p>OF THE IRA</p>
        <p>By Ed Moloney.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 600 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $28.95.</p>
        <p>CAN the hope of the green-white-orange Irish flag -- peace between Catholic and Protestant -- ever be realized? When Ed Moloney, a respected journalist born in England and educated in Northern Ireland, finished ''A Secret History of the IRA'' earlier this year, the omens looked good. The agreement signed on Good Friday, 1998, with papal blessing and low-key American support, continued a cease-fire by the mainstream Irish Republican Army, and its political ally, Sinn Fein, had joined the power-sharing assembly in Belfast to which Britain had transferred day-to-day government. But the I.R.A. is still holding huge stocks of arms, mostly from Libya and the United States; then, last month, a senior Sinn Fein official was charged with having information likely to be of use to terrorists, reportedly on possible targets for assassination. Britain suspended the Northern Ireland assembly to forestall a walkout by hard-line Protestants. In the worst case, the killing and maiming of 35 years of guerrilla war and savage counterinsurgency resumes and Ireland, north and south, is back at tragic Square 1.</p>
        <p>Moloney, a former Northern editor of The Irish Times and The Sunday Tribune in Dublin, begins his account in the 1960's, when the bitter seeds of the current cycle of Ireland's Troubles were planted and the leadership still dominant on both sides emerged. In his version (which, having covered the same events for The Sunday Times of London, I commend), Northern Ireland's repressive stability was shattered, like that of many another unjust regime, by over-timid attempts at reform. In 1965, with a reasoning that still holds good, the patrician Protestant Northern Irish prime minister, Terence O'Neill, met his Dublin counterpart, Sean Lemass, a veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising, arguing that Catholic acceptance of Northern Ireland was needed to revitalize its economy and that this meant giving Catholics fairer access to jobs and houses. A fiery Protestant fundamentalist, the Rev. Ian Paisley, warned of a sellout to Rome. Seeing their privileges threatened, working-class Protestants formed ''loyalist'' gangs. In the summer of 1966, loyalists shot a Catholic, Peter Ward, 18, caught in a Protestant pub; a Catholic pedestrian was shot on the street; and an elderly Protestant woman died in a botched bar firebombing -- the first deaths of the present round. Inspired by the American civil rights movement, young students, mostly Catholic, formed their own protest movement, People's Democracy; in 1969, loyalists attacked a movement march, setting off escalating sectarian violence and a Northern Irish government request for British troops.</p>
        <p>Welcomed as peacemakers, they soon aroused ancestral memories of long-ago English invasions. Moloney notes that many of the regulars were veterans of counterinsurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Kenya and unthinkingly brought with them colonial perceptions of native treachery. On Aug. 9, 1971, police officers and soldiers arrested 342 people, mostly Catholics, who were interned without charge or trial, many on the strength of outdated intelligence, mistaken identity or village gossip. Some were tortured. Riots broke out all over Northern Ireland. On Jan. 30, 1972, Bloody Sunday, in a bungled attempt to bring the I.R.A. to battle, British paratroopers in Londonderry fatally shot 14 unarmed Catholic civil rights demonstrators, none connected with the I.R.A. The British Embassy in Dublin was burned, and young Catholics flocked to join the terrorists. In 1972, the most violent year of the Troubles, 467 people died.</p>
        <p>The internment of old-line I.R.A. fighters -- Moloney estimates there were no more than 50 still active in Belfast -- cleared the way for younger militants still unknown to the police. The ablest of them, Gerry Adams, was 18 and working in a bar in 1966 when, according to Moloney, he was sworn into Company D of the I.R.A.'s Belfast Brigade, in which his father had been wounded in an action. On both sides the Adamses have deep republican roots (meaning, in Irish terms, they favored the reunification of Ireland at gunpoint if necessary). Adams was brought up in Ballymurphy, an isolated Catholic ghetto on the western edge of Belfast in constant danger of loyalist violence.</p>
        <p>Adams, president of Sinn Fein since 1983, has never admitted involvement with the I.R.A., but with his family history this is hard to believe. More surprising, Moloney reports that Adams has never personally ''fired a shot in anger against the British or their local allies.'' Still, he was briefly interned without trial in 1972, again in 1973, and then served three years for trying to escape. In periods of freedom, according to Moloney, Adams rose to command the Belfast Brigade and is credited with introducing Armalite rifles bought with contributions by Irish-Americans to the cause of ''Northern Aid.''</p>
        <p>Adams shared his time in prison, Moloney reports, with a group of internees devising a new strategy for the I.R.A. Force was still favored to drive the British out but, to achieve something ''during our lifetimes,'' Adams called for a long war that, to retain the essential support of Catholics, meant open political activity as well. In this, Moloney says, lay the germ of the I.R.A.'s acceptance of a cease-fire 20 years later. Most of Moloney's book is devoted to the gradual evolution of this policy: years of nonstop bloodshed, some 3,600 deaths to date, a slow-motion World Trade Center in an area scarcely bigger than Connecticut; of tragicomedy, like the racehorse held by the I.R.A. for ransom, shot while trying to escape; and of stomach-turning cruelty on both sides (the ''Shankill Butchers,'' a Protestant gang who sliced their Catholic victims with cleavers, and the ''human bombs,'' beginning with a Catholic working for the army who was forced by the I.R.A. to drive a car bomb into a base and was then blown up). Moloney names a self-effacing hero, the Rev. Alec Reid, a Redemptorist priest who acted as a tireless go-between, and fills out the roles of other men of peace: the Northern-descended Irish prime minister, Charles Haughey, and the Nobel laureate John Hume, who risked his Catholic support to meet Adams and convey plans for an end to I.R.A. terrorism.</p>
        <p>Through the many and devious policy shifts that led to the 1997 I.R.A. cease-fire, Moloney traces what he calls the ''golden thread'' of consent implicit in the principles of nonviolence laid down by the mediator, and former United States senator, George J. Mitchell: there are two traditions in Ireland, as the flag acknowledges, and peaceful reunification can be achieved only by negotiation between them, meaning that a majority in Northern Ireland, as well as a majority in the Irish Republic, must first democratically agree. But Ireland also has two traditions of lawless violence, not one; and the terrorists of the loyalist side have not disarmed either, any more than the I.R.A. has -- and neither is likely to give up its weapons while the other side keeps its. A return to the sectarian battles of 1972 onward is still a possibility -- pessimistically, until the current generation of die-hards passes on.</p>
        <p>It takes two to make peace; one side cannot unilaterally cancel the hatreds of 30 violent years. Freelance, unauthorized terrorism by unreconciled I.R.A. and loyalist splinter groups goes on, and while most Catholics support an all-party government in Belfast, the Democratic Unionist Party of Ian Paisley, with his uncompromising watchword ''No Surrender!,'' emphatically does not. Paisley's Unionist Party is attracting more and more Protestant votes, forcing the moderate Ulster Unionist Party to harden its stance against Sinn Fein. On a recent visit to Northern Ireland, I saw heartening economic progress that gives working-class Catholics and Protestants alike a stake in reconciliation; mortgages and machine guns seldom go together. In a telling aside, Moloney reports that Gerry Adams, usually clad these days in politician's suit and tie, dresses down to jeans and T-shirt to meet his old working-class I.R.A. comrades. Moloney throws much new light, though of necessity on only one side, on a far from finished conflict. He's made an important contribution to our understanding just the same.</p>
