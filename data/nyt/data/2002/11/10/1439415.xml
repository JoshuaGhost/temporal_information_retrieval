        <p>TWELVE years ago, Don Fink didn't know how to swim.</p>
        <p>That is somewhat amazing, considering that Mr. Fink, 44, a resident of Short Hills, is now a full-time triathlete and coach.</p>
        <p>Equally noteworthy is that just two years ago, he spent most of his time running from meeting to meeting as Citibank's managing director for private banking in the mid-Atlantic states.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Fink, who was named to last year's Inside Triathlon and USA Triathlon All-American teams, has become one of the world's best triathletes in his age group.</p>
        <p>He took his first steps in that direction many years ago, racing cousins on the sand of the Jersey Shore. He was fast. Success made for enjoyment.</p>
        <p>In his junior high school years, his parents would rise to find footprints in the snow leading from their Scotch Plains home. Mr. Fink would get up at 4 a.m. to run every day, believing, as he still does, that regular training leads to improvement bit by bit.</p>
        <p>''When I look back, I don't remember anyone teaching this to me, but it's how I've approached it every day,'' he said. He trains 10 to 30 hours a week</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fink did not spend 30-plus years working to become an international athlete. While attending Lehigh University on a partial track and cross-country scholarship, he quit competitive running because of injuries. After graduating in 1980 with a degree in finance and economics, he ran only to bolster his tennis game. He was highly competitive on the court, but most of his energies were directed toward his banking career.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until he married in 1990 that Mr. Fink became interested in triathlons. He started swimming and biking simply because his wife, Melanie, did.</p>
        <p>Everything changed after he entered a sprint triathlon (a half-mile swim, three-mile run and 15-mile bike effort) in 1991.</p>
        <p>''The fact I didn't do that well made it sort of intriguing to me,'' he said. Improvement then became a ''sort of fun project.''</p>
        <p>He and his wife were soon spending vacations at triathlon camps or working individually with top coaches. Before and after work, he would train, rising at 4 a.m., as he had in junior high, to put in two to three hours.</p>
        <p>''Time went by very quickly,''' Mr. Fink said. ''The years just flew by. I had such a demanding job and hobby that a five-  or six-year period seemed like a week.''</p>
        <p>His training, heavy on aerobic development that included constant monitoring of his heart rate, started leading to achievements. In 1997, he became the national 35-to-39-year-old division Long Course (half-triathlon) champion.</p>
        <p>In what free time he had, he found himself writing training plans for friends who were impressed by his results.</p>
        <p>In 1998, at the Ironman Triathlon World Championship, the arduous competition in Hawaii that involves a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike course and a 26.2-mile run, Mr. Fink finished second in his age group and in the top 20 over all. Then, in 1999, he was the first American finisher of any age in the 1999 Ironman European Championship.</p>
        <p>But he wasn't satisfied.</p>
        <p>''I'd leave a meeting, fly to Germany and run a race, and then fly back the next day,'' Mr. Fink said. ''This was an interesting journey I found myself on, and I wanted to enjoy it more.''</p>
        <p>So, he left Citibank in spring 2000 on a leave of absence. He has not gone back.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Fink, whose costly travel is covered by both national and local business sponsors, is competing at the highest levels and making his living by coaching. A small part of that is a twice-weekly swim class at the Y in Bridgewater. Most of the people who take the class are triathletes.</p>
        <p>''One of the neat things in my life, and it hits me once in a while while on the deck, is the thought that 12 years ago I didn't know how to swim,'' Mr. Fink said.</p>
        <p>Most of his coaching is by Internet and phone. He oversees 50 triathletes and 30 runners in the United States, Canada and Europe, and he has a long waiting list of potential clients.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced people all have a secret life they want to live,'' he said. ''But it's tough and risky to take that step. I truly believe anybody can make a living at their passion. All that's needed is a little guts. A lot of people with a lot of money are real miserable. I wake up every morning and I'm real excited.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink, who hasn't closed the door on returning to the financial world (he is often glued to the business news on television when training indoors), said his typical client was 30 to 55 years old, married with children and had a demanding professional life.</p>
        <p>''It's the most exciting thing in the world,'' he said. ''I'll be at the finish line and see their kids and I can't help but think their lives will change as a result of seeing their father or mother take on an impossible challenge and succeed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink doesn't coach young professional ''elites who have all day to train,'' because he doesn't find that interesting or challenging.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean his athletes are not successful.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Hughes, 44, of Columbus, Ohio, became a world champion last year, winning the Hawaiian Ironman in the 40-to-44 age group for women.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes, the mother of two, said Mr. Fink had played a huge part in her victory. She is a 15-year triathlete who has trained with him for two years. They keep in constant e-mail contact and talk by phone every couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>''Other coaches are more cookie-cutter,'' she said, noting that he adapted her training schedule to her personal life. ''He's very interested in you and what your plans are. He's doing this for the passion of the sport.''</p>
        <p>A New Jersey client, Jeff Liccardi of Warren, agreed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liccardi, 42, didn't know how to swim when he signed up for Mr. Fink's Bridgewater class two years ago. He was also a slow runner, averaging 11-minute miles over short distances. But last year he did his first marathon in 3:15. This year he finished in the middle of the pack in Ironman USA in Lake Placid, N.Y., which attracted more than 1,500 entrants, more than 20 coached by Mr. Fink.</p>
        <p>''He was happier when I finished than I was,'' said Mr. Liccardi, a father of three who owns auto dealerships in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''He's the most genuine person,'' he added. ''Obviously he's not doing this for the money. He had a great job. I know a lot of successful people. A lot of people don't love their work, but it pays good money. He has the passion to help people. It takes a lot of courage to do that. Most people are afraid to branch out in a different direction. They want to stay in their comfort zone. That's another reason why I respect him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink's career change struck a nerve with Richard Haig Jr., 39, of Bridgewater, who owns a security and fire alarm company and has been coached by Mr. Fink for a year and a half.</p>
        <p>Several months ago, Mr. Haig, the father of two girls, started a sideline business, FeMaleRacing.com, on multisport training.</p>
        <p>Without Mr. Fink, Mr. Haig said he wouldn't be placing in triathlons and might not even be doing them. He said he ''absolutely would not have the confidence to go into coaching and look at it as a future career.''</p>
        <p>In addition to expanding his new business, Mr. Haig, who has completed three Ironman-distance triathlons, finishing third by age bracket in the C.E.O. Challenge division at Lake Placid, plans to do the big event in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>The time frame is important because he wants to compete for his father, who has cancer.</p>
        <p>''There's no question in my mind that we'll get there, and I mean we, because I couldn't do it without him,'' he said of Mr. Fink.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haig quoted Mr. Fink as saying: ''At 35, 40 or 45, you can get better every year for 10 years. It's about training.''</p>
        <p>''How can you argue with him?'' he asked. ''He's done it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink's goal is to break nine hours at an Ironman (his best time to date is 9:03). He is one of only 35 people chosen to compete this month in the Ultra-Man World Championship in Hawaii. The three-day event makes Ironman races look like light training, with a combined 6.2 miles of swimming, 261 miles of biking and 52 miles of running.</p>
        <p>''You always want to push beyond and find something that scares you a little bit,'' Mr. Fink said.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing to think that what I loved at 12 I love at 44, and even more,'' he added. ''Sometimes I wake up and say, 'How'd I get here?' ''</p>
