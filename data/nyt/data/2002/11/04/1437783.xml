        <p>Janet B Pascal notes that nearly one half of American households, often homes of the poor and elderly, will be hurt as companies charge for paper bills to get customers to make payments on-line (S)</p>

        <p>''Want Bills by Snail Mail? It Might Cost You Money'' (Business Day, Oct. 29) dismisses those who are unable to pay bills online in an aside: ''After all, not everyone owns a computer or has a fast Internet connection.''</p>
        <p>In fact, as you report, the households with no computer or Internet connection make up nearly half of America. And these forgotten consumers will be, on the whole, the struggling or poorer households, or the elderly to whom computers are still a frightening newcomer -- the people to whom additional charges are the greatest burden.</p>

        <p>In fact, as you report, the households with no computer or Internet connection make up nearly half of America. And these forgotten consumers will be, on the whole, the struggling or poorer households, or the elderly to whom computers are still a frightening newcomer -- the people to whom additional charges are the greatest burden.</p>
        <p>Companies that charge $8 to send a paper bill when they save only $1 by sending it online are actually squeezing out extra money from their poorest customers in the process. Is it fair to ask these people to pay more in order to guarantee the well-off other half the convenience of push-button bill paying?</p>
