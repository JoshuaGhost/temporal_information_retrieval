        <p>Cheim &amp; Read  547 West 25th Street, Chelsea  Through Nov. 16</p>
        <p>Bettina Rheims's 1991 color photographs of young women arranging themselves and their garments as they please, usually for erotic effect, in cheap Parisian hotel rooms anticipate the ubiquitous in-the-buff photography of the last decade, while suggesting a cross between Cindy Sherman film stills and Chantal Ackerman's classic film ''Jeanne Dielman.''</p>
        <p>They are also nothing if not an argument for a national sensibility, conjuring a host of French films and starlets, notions of French style, beauty and sexiness, as well as the photographs of Man Ray and Brassa√Ø. Thankfully, the gaze these images imply is neither typically French nor male. Opening or shedding their clothing, lolling about on beds, upending themselves in chairs, Ms. Rheims's subjects seem to say, ''My body may be an object, but it's my object and I'll do as I please.''</p>
        <p>The contrast of youthful skin and shabby setting may be a little familiar, especially from the French, but enhanced by Ms. Rheims's strong color sense and her subjects' usually bemused detachment, the work still makes a strong impression.</p>
