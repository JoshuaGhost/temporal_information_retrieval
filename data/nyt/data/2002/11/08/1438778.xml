        <p>SOMEHOW, I'd known it would turn out like this: On a brilliant, sun-washed day, in a creek so pure and quiet it seemed like something from a dream, my 6-year-old daughter was jumping from rock to rock, hunting for newts and little frogs and other exotica in the clear, cold water. From my perch on the bank, I could see an elegant blue heron lifting from the streambed and angling off into the woods. Water sparkled like sequins under the broad patches of green (watercress? mint?) growing at the edges of the stream.

        <p>SOMEHOW, I'd known it would turn out like this: On a brilliant, sun-washed day, in a creek so pure and quiet it seemed like something from a dream, my 6-year-old daughter was jumping from rock to rock, hunting for newts and little frogs and other exotica in the clear, cold water. From my perch on the bank, I could see an elegant blue heron lifting from the streambed and angling off into the woods. Water sparkled like sequins under the broad patches of green (watercress? mint?) growing at the edges of the stream. And out of the corner of my eye I spied a long, thin snake undulating in the shallows near me; whipping between chunks of smooth sandstone, the 18-inch reptile paused, then poked its little head up to scan for prey.</p>
        <p>''Katherine,'' I shouted, ''guess what?''</p>
        <p>''What?'' she said excitedly, hoping for a beaver dam or a muskrat hole.</p>
        <p>''You won't believe this,'' I called in a determinedly breezy voice. ''I left the engine on in the car. Can you hop back here quickly so we can turn it off right now?''</p>
        <p>As she skipped back toward me, I watched the snake swimming lazily in her direction. And I recalled the chill I felt when I paged through my worn copy of ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'' the night before. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about a year in the life of this stream, the essayist Annie Dillard noted that she never hiked in these parts without a snake-bite kit: copperheads and water moccasins, it seems, are plentiful in the Roanoke Valley.</p>
        <p>Of course, my child never noticed the snake I'd seen. And I felt ridiculous for trying to keep her away from the (probably) harmless creature; if there's anything I despise, it's people who overreact to fat spiders and strange sounds in the woods. Still, I was haunted by Ms. Dillard's take on this place. She had won me over in 1974 (when ''Pilgrim'' was published) with her extravagantly beautiful language. But it was her sense of drama that had left the strongest impression -- and that spurred me to visit Tinker Creek. The landscape that Ms. Dillard described is a profligate, cruel microcosm ''running on chance and death'' -- a place whose creator designed lacewings that devour their eggs as fast as they can lay them and spiders that wrap hummingbirds in silk and feast on their vital fluids.</p>
        <p>Beyond the book, I'd felt the gravitational pull of Ms. Dillard herself. Just 27 when she began work on ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,'' she was a bold poet, fluent in natural history as well as in theology. An insatiable explorer who had written a master's thesis on Thoreau at Hollins College (now University), she spent a year prowling the stream that flows south from Tinker Mountain to the Roanoke River. Camping alone or leaving her house at dawn to stalk muskrats, she lived like a hermit, of sorts -- one blessed with splendiferous visions. In ''Tinker Creek,'' she wrote, ''I walk out; I see some event that would otherwise be utterly missed and lost, or something sees me, some enormous power that brushes me with its clean wing, and I resound like a beaten bell.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-seven years after winning the Pulitzer Prize, Ms. Dillard lives in Connecticut, where she is an adjunct professor at Wesleyan University. And finding the stretch of Tinker Creek that she made her own isn't so simple now. ''Pilgrim'' is short on geographical specifics, and -- in a book seething with detail -- there are few that describe locations an outsider could find.</p>
        <p>As soon as we rolled into Roanoke, then, I called Hollins University, where Richard Dillard, the writing professor whom Ms. Dillard married when she was a student, still teaches. (They are now divorced.) Telling the public affairs director that I wanted to trace the writer's path for The New York Times, I asked for her help. Within the hour, she called back to report that Mr. Dillard had mapped the route for me, showing the house they had shared and outlining the stretch of the creek she explored. (Directions were often sought in the 70's, he said, but the requests are fewer these days.) And there it was: a neighborhood with street names like Ridgecrest Drive and College View Court, with a light blue creek line beginning at Shadwell Drive.</p>
        <p>Before our adventure, my daughter and I took a walk through downtown Roanoke -- a place that has retained much of its Southern character. Restaurants still serve oversweetened iced tea and dry-goods stores carry the kind of overalls often worn with one strap flapping free. Of course, the city has its share of malls colonized by Old Navy and Olive Garden, but the soulless stuff hasn't made it to Market Square. Its highlights include a lively little market where farmers sell gaudy sunflowers and home-grown cafes whose noontime ''dinners'' could stun a farmhand. (Don't linger, though; visitors who ignore the one-hour limit in the free-parking zone are issued $15 tickets faster than you can say ''speed trap.'')</p>
        <p>After lunch, we followed the map to the Dillards' former home in a decorous suburb; a ranch house with a picture window and a steeply sloping front yard, it looked correct and completely anonymous. On a weekday, the neighborhood was perfectly still as we cruised down the street and parked on the bridge spanning the creek. The only way to reach the water was to scramble down a hill behind someone's house; as we reached the bottom, a gray-haired woman appeared in the driveway above us. Standing behind a ''No Trespassing'' sign, she squinted meaningfully.</p>
        <p>Grasping the hand of my uncannily friendly daughter (a child who chats up doormen and store clerks), I said, ''Look -- let's wave to the lady.'' For good measure, I added a neighborly ''Hey!'' -- like Scout Finch greeting Boo Radley in ''To Kill a Mockingbird.''</p>
        <p>From that point on, of course, no one gave us any trouble. We were free to watch the leaves that formed a canopy over the rocky creekbed. To follow the tadpoles darting from pool to pool. To peer into the stream (only about 15 feet wide, at that point) and inspect the oddments nestling against the rocks -- a decaying walnut, a decomposing thistle that could have been a sea anemone, a weathered Nehi bottle that might have contained a secret message from a desert island.</p>
        <p>Novel, for city folks, but a far cry from the astonishing drama in the passage I'd read to Katherine the night before. In it, Ms. Dillard describes a little green frog ''[shrinking] . . . like a deflated football'' -- sucked dry by a giant water bug. Its innards liquefied by poisons in the bug's bite, the amphibian collapses into a sack of skin -- ''formless as a pricked balloon'' -- that hangs ''in floating folds like scum on top of the water.''</p>
        <p>As we discovered, though, drama comes in many guises. We found another part of Ms. Dillard's creek in a neighborhood of sagging porches and Pentecostal churches. Up a hill and down, we followed a dead-end street to a traffic barrier. Picking our way through the sparse woods, we took a path hung with spider webs, littered with broken glass and bordered by beer cans. Near the bank were remains of a small campfire. A rotting rope hung from a tree branch over a murky pool; weathered boards nailed at odd angles formed steps up the tree's peeling trunk. A bored dog barked in the distance, lending a Coen brothers creepiness to the scene.</p>
        <p>But then we began looking at things as Ms. Dillard had -- taking a newt's eye view of the world. ''Look,'' Katherine whispered. ''Poison strawberries!'' Squatting beside her, I saw four or five wizened, doll-size berries. As we watched, a dragonfly with a blue-tipped body no bigger than a needle zoomed into view and lit on a stalk; wings thrumming furiously, it grasped an invisible morsel and began to eat. Moments later, a pack of small white butterflies fluttered out of the dusty underbush, looking like hydrangea petals sailing about.</p>
        <p>The show-stoppers, though, were the ants -- plain little black ants trying to shove a choice morsel into a hole in the ground. My daughter saw them first; gasping, she pointed to a spot near her sneaker, where a posse was working crazily. Silently, we watched as they hefted the prize (the size and shape of a fingernail clipping), lugged it to the hole and maneuvered crazily. Over and over, they pushed and pulled, attacking the task from different angles -- and failed.</p>
        <p>Staring hard, we watched them toil for long minutes, and I, at least, struggled with the impulse to stomp them out of their misery. Good thing I didn't, because a tiny miracle transpired. After dumping their burden and clustering for a confab, the ants executed a new plan. Lugging the stubborn prize to a hole that was -- Eureka! -- one millimeter wider, they scrambled in and began to tug. All at once, their prize slipped down the hole -- and out of sight.</p>
        <p>I'm sure there was a moral to that tale. But on that day, just learning to see through Annie Dillard's eyes was enough.</p>
        <p>PILGRIMAGE  Roanoke Valley Greenways</p>
        <p>''PILGRIM AT TINKER CREEK'' is available in paperback from HarperPerennial Classics, whose 25th anniversary edition includes an afterword by the author. If you would like to make your own pilgrimage, note that, though much of Tinker Creek runs through private property, you can avoid trespassing by visiting the public stretch that runs through a city park. From Interstate 581, take Exit 6 (Elm Avenue/Route 24) east for a mile and a half to Fallon Park. The Tinker Creek Greenway runs through the park. A brochure with maps of Roanoke Valley Greenways is at the Roanoke Valley Convention and Visitors Bureau (114 Market Street, 800-635-5535).</p>
