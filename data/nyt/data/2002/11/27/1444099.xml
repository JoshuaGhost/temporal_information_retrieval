        <p>The Universal Music Group, the nation's No. 1 music company, is amending the way it reports royalty payments to artists in response to industry concerns, according to a person who has seen a copy of an internal memorandum distributed to Universal executives this week.</p>
        <p>Royalty payments are made to artists for records sold and have often been a point of contention between labels and the musicians they represent, with some artists complaining that they are not paid fairly by their recording companies. The companies can recoup certain costs, like recording advances and some video costs, before royalties are paid. In recent years, suits demanding changes in accounting practices, have been filed by several artists, including the Dixie Chicks, which sued the Sony Music Group, and Courtney Love, who sued Universal.</p>

        <p>The Universal Music Group, the nation's No. 1 music company, is amending the way it reports royalty payments to artists in response to industry concerns, according to a person who has seen a copy of an internal memorandum distributed to Universal executives this week.</p>
        <p>Royalty payments are made to artists for records sold and have often been a point of contention between labels and the musicians they represent, with some artists complaining that they are not paid fairly by their recording companies. The companies can recoup certain costs, like recording advances and some video costs, before royalties are paid. In recent years, suits demanding changes in accounting practices, have been filed by several artists, including the Dixie Chicks, which sued the Sony Music Group, and Courtney Love, who sued Universal.</p>
        <p>According to the memo, Universal, a unit of Vivendi Universal whose artists include Eminem and Mariah Carey, plans to increase the size of its audit staff to ensure faster audits, hold workshops for artists and their representatives to help them understand how royalties are paid and allow for greater access to manufacturing records.</p>
        <p>The memo said, too, that auditors would have more flexibility when it came to auditing Universal's books and records given that some recording contracts were either old or outdated or unduly restrictive.</p>
        <p>''This is a good thing,'' said Jay Cooper, a music lawyer based in Los Angeles. ''Up to now, record companies have not allowed people to see things like manufacturing records. It makes it much simpler.'' But he cautioned, too, that the success of the new changes would depend on whether Universal follows through.</p>
        <p>The changes at Universal come in response to hearings held earlier this year by State Senator Kevin Murray, a Democrat from Culver City, Calif. He pointed out that the recording industry had a perception problem among artists, who fear they are not being treated fairly.</p>
