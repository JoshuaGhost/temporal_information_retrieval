        <p>On a slope between Vienna's car-clogged W* hringerstrasse and the green ribbon of its Danube Canal are several city blocks filled with the six-story Biedermeier buildings one sees everywhere here. There are one or two exquisite Baroque-style buildings and a few monstrosities from the Bauhaus era, but otherwise Berggasse seems like just another anonymous working-class street in a European capital.</p>
        <p>Berggasse might escape the attentions of all but its own residents, in fact, had it not been the locus operandi for two of the 20th century's most significant social movements.</p>
        <p>Sigmund Freud spent nearly his entire working life at 19 Berggasse. From 1891 until 1938, he developed his theory of psychoanalysis here, famously writing his books and treating his patients in comfortable rooms on the building's second floor.</p>
        <p>Less well known is the fact that, among Freud's neighbors, living at 6 Berggasse from around 1896 to 1898, was Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Literary editor and Paris correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse, Europe's leading liberal newspaper at the time, Herzl published his tract ''The Jewish State'' in 1896 and lived on Berggasse, like Freud, as a celebrated giant and a derided crank.</p>
        <p>(The two never met, although Freud dreamed of Herzl; and although Herzl ignored the copy of ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' Freud sent him, hoping for a review, Freud did psychoanalyze Herzl's son, Hans, years later, diagnosing the suicidal youth as suffering, not surprisingly, from a profound Oedipal conflict.)</p>
        <p>Nothing commemorates the time Herzl spent on Berggasse, no plaque adorns the facade of No. 6. Indeed, one might search Vienna in vain looking for any public mention of his name. Zionists with a sense of history will have to settle for a slice of pizza at the Pizzeria Valentino or a drink at the Italian cocktail bar on No. 6's ground floor.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Freud Museum seems to form the cultural and economic epicenter of present-day Berggasse. Entering the building's Hapsburg-yellow foyer with its frosted, stenciled windows and its sinuous, black, vinelike stair railings, I'm overtaken by an overwhelming sense of dominating presence, a palpable spirit of place, and before I can shrug it off as deriving from my own imagination, my wife, Basha, says to me, ''Did you feel that?''</p>
        <p>We climb the stairs and ring the bell, as Dora and the Rat Man once did, and are soon in the rooms where Freud spent nearly 40 years, before he and his family were driven from their country by the Nazi SS and local collaborators.</p>
        <p>Freud took the apartment's furnishings to London when he fled, and they remained there until 1968, when, on a trip to the United States, Josef Klaus, the Austrian chancellor, was embarrassed by questions about Vienna's conspicuous lack of Freudian commemoration.</p>
        <p>Responding to the Austrian government's request, Freud's daughter Anna returned the furniture from her father's waiting room, along with 79 pieces of his extensive collection of antiquities. (The rest, kept in London, are now on exhibit in the Freud Museum there.) The waiting room, restored in the mid-1990's, is where Freud and the members of his Vienna Psychoanalytic Society held their Wednesday evening meetings, the men seated on its plush, burgundy-upholstered sofa and chairs.</p>
        <p>Although Berggasse had been, at the turn of the century, a step up for Jews like Herzl and Freud, who moved there from the ethnic slums of the Leopoldstadt, behind the Prater on the far side of the canal, the street grew decidedly working-class in the wake of Vienna's post-World War II occupation.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, when Massi Baumgartner moved his playfully contemporary furniture shop, Massi Design und Handels, into 30 Berggasse, the building was a -- unable to remember the English, Massi sends his ponytailed assistant bouncing back into the showroom for a German-English dictionary; after consulting it, she returns to the sidewalk where we're standing to utter the words he needs -- ''coal shop.'' Now Massi's streamlined designs fill the light and airy showroom: shelves of elegant glass bowls and vases, desk lamps resembling Picasso's sketches of Don Quixote, a wall of light bulbs with wings.</p>
        <p>The street is gentrifying, Massi tells us, nodding to an exquisitely white Baroque-style building near the Freud house. The restored ground floor, which was once an auto-parts factory, will soon display custom-made English furniture. Although the coal shop and other businesses have been forced from the street, elbowed out by more fashionable replacements, like an ergonomic furniture store, a few holdouts from the postwar years remain. Next to Massi's is a dingy shoemaker's shop, and across the street is a uniform shop for firemen.</p>
        <p>Near the top of the hill, at 3 Berggasse, is an army surplus store called Gelegenheitsschwemme. Every shelf and bin in its closetlike rooms is bursting with military merchandise, both new and antique, mostly from the Austrian Army, although there are many items from the United States, Russian and German armies, as well as Dutch trousers, Belgian shoes and Italian jackets.</p>
        <p>Kurt Hellmann inherited the store from his parents, who opened the shop in 1955 when the British, American, French and Russian occupying forces left Austria. In the wake of the Allies' withdrawal, Kurt's father came into possession of thousands of pairs of boots that he had to raffle off, so great was the demand for decent footwear in the ravaged Vienna of that time, and that is how the store was born.</p>
        <p>''And where do you get your merchandise these days?'' I ask.</p>
        <p>''We have to have some secrets,'' Kurt tells me.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most emblematic of this era in the street's history is Möbel Beer, at 32 Berggasse (Freud's famous patient Dora is said to have onced lived here). A block from the canal, at the corner of Hahngasse, Möbel Beer is an enormous secondhand shop run by Charlotte Beer.</p>
        <p>Signs in the windows proclaim the bargains within: ''Alle Möbel um 50% billiger!!!'' and ''Alles zum halben Preis.''</p>
        <p>Plastic laundry bins of used clothing and tablecloths line its front walk. A canister of canes shares space with a tray of clocks and one of silverware and one of tools. Basha finds a pair of lace tablecloths, one hand-embroidered, both elegant, and pays around $2 for each of them.</p>
        <p>The interior is dark and dusty for an Austrian shop, which is to say hardly dark and dusty at all, but darker and less dusty than the newer shops down the road.</p>
        <p>For $100, you can buy a pair of big, sturdy armoires. ''The only problem would be shipping them,'' Basha says, as we reluctantly leave without having made a sizable purchase.</p>
        <p>The restaurants on Berggasse seem to reflect its changing face as well. There's a Café Freud, of course, next to the Freud Museum, and two sushi restaurants peek out from a couple of side streets. There are places for Chinese food and fish and a Mexican restaurant serving, according to its sign, ''Acapulco Mexikanische Spezialit* tan.'' There's a gay coffeehouse called Berg at 8 Berggasse that turns into a gay bar at night. A discreet pink triangle is incorporated into the sign it shares with Löwenherz, the gay bookstore next door.</p>
        <p>There are cafes on every block and more than half a dozen traditional Wiener küchen, all with outdoor seating. The most inviting of these is Wiener Beisl, at 24 Berggasse. Its menu features traditional Austrian specialties along with reasonably priced vegetarian dishes.</p>
        <p>At the foot of Berggasse, along the canal, is a bike trail that runs all the way to Germany. Sitting on a bench, Basha and I enviously watch the cyclists who whiz by on one of the 1,500 free ''Vienna bikes'' supplied by the city.</p>
        <p>Overlooking the slow waters of the canal, a bar called Summer Stage has concerts and art exhibits in its glass pavilion. Six sculptures rotate on motorized pedestals in the sculpture garden. Nearby is a sandy volleyball court next to a trampoline station for children. Parents heft large beers and eat nachos while the kids grow dizzy and faint.</p>
        <p>There's no knowing what Freud and Herzl would make of their old street; no knowing what Freud would mutter to himself as he passed Die Philosophie im Boudoir, an erotica shop with a mural over its front door depicting a half-dressed peasant girl sneaking coquettishly into bed; no knowing if Herzl would stop in at the Persian rug shop at 14 Berggasse and shake his head over the current situation in the Middle East with its proprietor, Dr. Mohammi. But there's probably no better street in the world on which to sit in a cafe over a kaffee mélange and wonder about such things.</p>
