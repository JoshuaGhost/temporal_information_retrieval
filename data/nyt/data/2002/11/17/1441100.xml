        <p>In 1929, 20,000 spectators honored the great sled dog Togo at Madison Square Garden for his heroic efforts transporting a vital supply of diphtheria antitoxin serum across Alaska. Four years earlier, in the so-called Great Serum Race, 20 teams of sled dogs had relayed the antitoxin across 674 miles of harsh terrain in the dead of winter -- a journey memorialized today by the Iditarod race. Togo alone led his team over 260 miles.</p>
        <p>One might think that a roaring crowd in New York City -- and a gold medal awarded by the explorer Roald Amundsen -- would be enough to cement Togo's place in history as the most sublime Siberian husky of all time. But Togo's legacy has not been a happy one.</p>
        <p>Who ended up with his own statue in New York City's Central Park? Another husky, name of Balto. And who was immortalized by a popular animated movie in 1995 (and its direct-to-video sequel)? Again, Balto. To this day, Alaskan sled dog aficionados are incensed at history's disregard for the onetime ''scrub'' dog who, more than any other single canine, helped save the lives of diphtheria victims in Nome so many decades ago.</p>
        <p>If we needed any fresh proof of society's fixation on front-runners, Togo's plight provides ample evidence. The Great Serum Race involved 160 sled dogs. Four of them died, and many others were permanently injured by the horrific winter weather and back-breaking pace. Balto led his team a paltry 53 miles. But Balto's leg of the trip was the all-important final one, and to the victor accrued the spoils -- the newspaper stories, fawning admirers and cartoon hagiographies.</p>
        <p>In an effort to address this mockery of justice, two children's books with the explicit goal of rehabilitating Togo's reputation have arrived simultaneously, nose to nose and paw to paw, competing for the right to inform a new generation of youngsters about what really went down in the snowy wastes of Alaska.</p>
        <p>''The Great Serum Race: Blazing the Iditarod Trail,'' by Debbie S. Miller, with illustrations by Jon Van Zyle, covers the entire race from beginning to end, focusing as much as possible on the contributions of all the dogs (albeit with a focus on Togo, as is only natural, given Togo's disproportionate share of the hauling). As its forthright title indicates, ''Togo,'' written and illustrated by Robert J. Blake, fixates primarily on the victim of history so cruelly supplanted by that sled-dog-come-lately, Balto.</p>
        <p>''The Great Serum Race'' is the superior work of revisionist sled-dog-ology. Miller's prose reads more smoothly than Blake's. It is considerably more detailed, and appears to hew more closely to the existing historical record. While Blake writes in an author's note that he ''heard many different versions'' of the serum run and asserts that his story ''is how I imagine it may have been,'' Miller's epilogue includes a bibliography of selected sources, including a list of taped interviews with original mushers who participated in the race. She also offers a fascinating account of the post-race travails of both Balto and Togo, including their pathetic stint as part of a traveling vaudeville troupe, and the current location of their stuffed corpses -- Togo at the Iditarod Race Museum in Alaska, Balto at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>''The Great Serum Race'' also manages to be multiculturally sensitive without erring on the side of stifling political correctness. Athabaskan Indians and Yupik Eskimos served as mushers in the desperate relay. Nary a word about them is heard in ''Togo.''</p>
        <p>But rather than choose between the two, parents interested in really giving their children something to mull over might be advised to get both books and to rent ''Balto,'' the animated movie. And while you're at it, fire up a Web browser and surf some of the many sites devoted to sled dog history and mythology.</p>
        <p>Truth, your children will learn, is as slippery as the ice in the Alaskan tundra. Try explaining why, for example, Togo is not mentioned even once in ''Balto,'' the movie. Even more puzzling, why did the movie's producers think it necessary to turn Balto into a half-wolf, half-husky mutt? Surely there was enough drama in the struggle to save lives in Nome to make changing a purebred sled dog's genetic makeup unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Then discuss whether Blake, by focusing almost exclusively on Togo, isn't making the same mistake as the Balto worshipers. According to a number of accounts available on the Web, at one point during the final leg of the race Balto, on his own initiative, halted his team in the middle of a raging blizzard, rather than move ahead onto an insufficiently thick frozen lake that his musher could not see. Without that act of prescience, the serum would never have made it to Nome, period, and diphtheria would have raged unchecked. But neither ''Togo'' nor ''The Great Serum Race'' mentions this feat. Why? Would it have undermined the Togo-hero thesis?</p>
        <p>Rehabilitating Togo is a decent excuse for publishing a few more children's books, but once you take the lid off Pandora's sled-dog box, it's hard to know where to stop. The deeper you dig, the more you learn, and the more you question. Siberian huskies, as their name would suggest, were not native to Alaska. They were late-19th-century imports, lighter and faster than the indigenous breed of Alaskan sled dog, the chunky malamute.</p>
        <p>For millenniums, malamutes (often interbred by their owners with wild wolves, thus lending a little credence to the cartoon half-breed appearance in ''Balto'') reigned supreme in Alaska. But no more; the huskies took care of that.</p>
        <p>No doubt, during those many centuries before the white man arrived, generations of malamutes saved lives and performed feats of doggy derring-do. But where are their biographers? Even if Togo's image has slipped over the years, he did have that Madison Square Garden appearance in 1929. There have also been numerous books, documentaries and even an early Hollywood short film on the sled dogs of the Great Serum Race.</p>
        <p>If we're really serious about rehabilitating sled dog reputations, one feels impelled to ask: What about the malamutes? Who will shed a tear for them?</p>
