        <p>A Federal District judge yesterday dismissed J. P. Morgan Chase's request for immediate payment of about $1 billion owed to it by 11 insurance companies who had backed certain oil and gas contracts that the bank had with Enron.</p>
        <p>The ruling, by Judge Jed S. Rakoff, which was expected, means that the case could go to trial early next month.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan filed suit against the insurers after Enron sought bankruptcy protection in December. The insurers had guaranteed trades between a J. P. Morgan entity and Enron. In refusing to pay J. P. Morgan, the insurers have said that the policies were fraudulently obtained because the bank's contracts with Enron were loans in disguise.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for J. P. Morgan, Joseph Evangelisti, said yesterday that ''We believe we have a strong case and that we should prevail at trial.'' A lawyer for several of the insurers, Alan Levine, of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner &amp; Hellman, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan's suit against the insurers has been followed by lawmakers and stockholders. The nature of the bank's contracts with Enron was discussed at a Senate hearing in July. And some investors in J. P. Morgan said the uncertainty surrounding the litigation was a factor weighing on the stock.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan's shares are down more than 39 percent this year as the bank has suffered losses on loans to telecommunications and cable companies. The shares closed Wednesday at 22.06, down 41 cents.</p>
        <p>Some investors have been pushing the bank to conserve cash by cutting its hefty dividend.</p>
        <p>''If they win the case, there would be a huge inflow of cash, they can maintain their dividend, and Bill Harrison can breathe a huge sigh of relief,'' said one investor in the shares, referring to the bank's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>But if the bank loses, it would likely have to take a big charge, the investor said. Assuming the stock market has yet to recover, that could put more pressure on the bank to cut the dividend..</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan has listed the $1 billion owed by the insurance companies as a nonperforming asset but has not written down the amount on its books, Mr. Evangelisti said.</p>
        <p>Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said he is convinced that the bank will try to settle the case. ''It will be very difficult for J. P. Morgan to explain the intricacies of this case to a jury,'' Mr. Kraushaar said.</p>
