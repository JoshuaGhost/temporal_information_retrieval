        <p>Cranberry Relished</p>
        <p>The Web functions as a huge recipe database for anxious home cooks preparing for Thanksgiving. But the variety can be terrifying: around 5 p.m. today I'll know whether I chose the perfect stuffing out of the 335 recipes at Epicurious (epicurious.com).</p>

        <p>Cranberry Relished</p>
        <p>The Web functions as a huge recipe database for anxious home cooks preparing for Thanksgiving. But the variety can be terrifying: around 5 p.m. today I'll know whether I chose the perfect stuffing out of the 335 recipes at Epicurious (epicurious.com).</p>
        <p>Speaking of terrifying, Yahoo Search reports 1.6 million Web site matches for cooking a turkey and nearly 190,000 Thanksgiving recipe sites online. Untraditional menus are making headway, though. There are 11,300 site matches for tofu turkey.</p>
        <p>Many online old-timers favor one Thanksgiving recipe site in particular: the one for cranberry relish at ''Hi! Monkey'' (www.himonkey.net). The recipe itself is an odd -- some say addictive -- amalgam of sweet (cranberries, sugar and onion) and sour (horseradish and sour cream) that is attributed to Susan Stamberg, a National Public Radio correspondent. But the site is as well loved for its charming host, a terry cloth primate known only as Monkey, as for its cuisine.</p>
        <p>Monkey walks you through the recipe preparation and also offers a photo montage of ''the relish in action.'' There is even a page of poetic tributes to the creamy concoction. Monkey's alter ego, Marzi Pecen of Dallas, said that the site attracts thousands of visitors daily during the holiday season.</p>
        <p>''It's somewhere between an online tradition and a cult,'' Ms. Pecen said by e-mail, adding, ''I do get a fair number of messages from cranberry-deprived countries wondering just what I am talking about.''</p>
        <p>Googling Around</p>
        <p>Playing with Google is a popular Web pastime. There is something about the site's modest interface and broad reach that inspires an often-goofy creativity.</p>
        <p>Last week I spent far too much time at some new sites that are based on the Google search engine although they are not affiliated with or sponsored by it. The concept behind Google Fight (googlefight.com) is simple. Enter dueling keywords or phrases; the winner is the one with the most Web mentions. Tina Turner versus Ted Turner? Hot dog versus hamburger? Guess which was the hands-down victor.</p>
        <p>Googlism (googlism.com) is a bit more sophisticated. If you enter a keyword like a name or a place, the site will tell you what Google ''thinks'' of it -- that is, it lists pertinent phrases that Google has found at Web sites (though not links to the sites themselves). At the elegant elgooG (www.alltooflat.com/geeky/elgoog), you can glimpse the Web in reverse typography.</p>
        <p>Then there's ''Google cooking,'' a phrase coined by Judy Hourihan in her Weblog (judy.hourihan.com). At supper time Ms. Hourihan likes to type a few ingredients that she has on hand into Google and see what recipes result. The idea has been refined by Tara Calishain, author of the online newsletter ResearchBuzz (researchbuzz.com). Her Cookin' With Google program (www.buzztoolbox.com/google/goocookin.shtml) searches recipe databases, not the entire Web, reducing the number of unappetizing ''false positives,'' she says. Bon app√©tit!</p>
        <p>Imagine This</p>
        <p>Cataloging the imaginary is a venerable Web activity. Take the Invisible Library (invisiblelibrary.com), which contains many titles (''The Heart of a Milkman,'' ''The Culinary Dostoyevsky'') that I would like to read but can't, since it's ''a collection of books that only appear in other books.'' The site lists more than 2,800 imaginary works culled from novels. Is there a fan of ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' who has not longed for a copy of ''Hogwarts, a History''? Brian Quinette, creator of the site, cites J.K. Rowling, author of the ''Harry Potter'' series, and Rabelais as examples of writers who ''positively delight in making up books.''</p>
        <p>Likewise, the Rocklopedia Fakebandica (www.vgg.com/tp/tp--080700--fakeband.html) features fictional musical groups mentioned in movies and television shows. The site's creator, T. Mike Childs, has been overwhelmed by submissions (500 bands are already listed). He recently started a ''Miscellaneous'' page for imaginary bands mentioned in other mediums like novels and comic books. As with the Invisible Library, which maintains a page for ''Removed Books'' -- those that turned out to exist -- Mr. Childs said that people often ''erroneously send me bands that are actually real.''</p>
        <p>Another site that is growing by submission, though more slowly, is Kristina Naudus's personal update of The Dictionary of Imaginary Places, a book last revised in print in 2000. Ms. Naudus's site (www.urbangeek.net/dictionary/index.html) is not an authorized addendum to that book, which was written by Alberto Manguel and Gianni Guadalupi, but rather an informal ''online supplement,'' she said by e-mail. ''I thought the book was pretty cool (and worth owning) but was disappointed at how much wasn't included,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Naudus views the Web as a natural ''update forum'' for such works. Indeed, her site even encourages submissions in the style of the book's authors, and serves, I would venture, as a form of homage.</p>
        <p>On the Radar</p>
        <p>Periodic visits to ''The History of Michael Jackson's Face'' (anomalies-unlimited.com/Jackson.html) will ensure that you are never again shocked by a news photo of the Gloved One. How does your desk match up against those of other worker bees? Snap Your Desk (snapyourdesk.barkins.com) wants a snapshot of your work space. A perusal of the submissions raises the question of why we can't we come up with better ways to dress up our PC's. Acronym Search (acronymsearch.com) explains nearly 45,000 acronyms and abbreviations and includes a reverse lookup function.</p>
