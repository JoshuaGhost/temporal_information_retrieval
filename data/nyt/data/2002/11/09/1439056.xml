        <p>The most memorable game of the local high school's 2002 football season is turning out to be a game that will not be played.</p>
        <p>The season finale was scheduled for 2 p.m. on Saturday, with Roosevelt's Rough Riders at home versus the visiting Seahawks from Cold Spring Harbor.</p>
        <p>Though the two Long Island school districts are quite different -- Cold Spring Harbor is on the wealthy North Shore with a 97.7 percent white enrollment, while Roosevelt is low-income with a 98.8 percent black or Hispanic enrollment -- their sports teams have competed for years without incident.</p>
        <p>But on Saturday, neither team will be showing up. Cold Spring Harbor forfeited the game rather than play here, citing safety concerns after a recent murder and gang violence involving Roosevelt students.</p>
        <p>So the football season is prematurely over, but the post-nongame debate is just getting started.</p>
        <p>''This was not a black-white issue, it was a safety issue,'' said Jim Amen Jr., athletic director at Cold Spring Harbor High School. ''People are portraying us as the elite community canceling the game, but we weren't jumping up and down to forfeit the game.''</p>
        <p>A Roosevelt High School student, Johnathon Harris, was murdered in a drive-by shooting off school property on Oct. 24; the police have charged a schoolmate, Jose Vasquez, with manslaughter, and are still investigating. The day after the killing, fighting broke out between rival black and Hispanic gangs at school, and classes ended early.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt school officials reacted by canceling some events, including homecoming and a pep rally. They called in the police and grief counselors and held group discussions. Then they decided to resume activities, including the game with Cold Spring Harbor.</p>
        <p>''We feel confident that all children will be in a safe environment,'' Roosevelt's superintendent, Horace Williams, wrote to Cold Spring Harbor.</p>
        <p>But parents and officials in Cold Spring Harbor were not reassured. Voicing fears for their team and spectators, they proposed switching the game to their own football field. Roosevelt declined and Cold Spring Harbor chose to forfeit the game.</p>
        <p>''I feel very sorry we were not able to play,'' Mr. Amen said. But when news reports ''highlighted the gang culture in Roosevelt,'' he said, ''parents were calling me left and right.''</p>
        <p>Roosevelt would not move the game to Cold Spring Harbor, but it countered with a third possibility.</p>
        <p>''We offered to play the game at a neutral site,'' Superintendent Williams said. ''I wanted to take the issue of politics and adults out of it and let the kids play the game.''</p>
        <p>Cold Spring Harbor rejected that plan. ''I didn't want to play at a neutral site,'' Mr. Amen said, because of safety concerns and uncertainty over who might attend. ''You open up a Pandora's box. You don't know who anybody is.''</p>
        <p>He also noted that after the violence Roosevelt had agreed to move games with East Rockaway and Carle Place to those schools, ''so we didn't set the precedent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams did not suggest there was any racial or class motive behind Cold Spring Harbor's decision, saying he simply felt bad for the Roosevelt team. ''They wanted to play that game,'' he said. ''It hurts. We shouldn't penalize the kids.''</p>
        <p>Today, several Roosevelt students expressed mixed feelings. Karren Drayton, a ninth grader, said she understood the fears for safety. ''We should get our act together so we can be respected by other schools,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But a classmate and cheerleader, Jessica Evans, suggested that Cold Spring Harbor had overreacted. ''It wasn't like it happened at the school,'' she said of the shooting.</p>
        <p>Roosevelt's team was disappointed, said Aaron Peace, a junior varsity player whose brother is on the varsity team.</p>
        <p>''They were mad because a lot of them really like football,'' he said. But he added, ''I could understand why they didn't want to come.'' Asked if he felt safe at the school, he said, ''not really.''</p>
        <p>In the past, safety worries have prompted other schools around the state to move, postpone or cancel games, said Nina Van Erk, executive director of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association. ''This is not the first time,'' she said, ''and it won't be the last.''</p>
        <p>The cancellation of Saturday's game had no impact on any playoffs; neither Roosevelt nor Cold Spring Harbor was a championship contender this season. Going into their final game, both teams had records of three victories and four defeats. The forfeiture gave Roosevelt four wins and four losses and Cold Spring Harbor three wins and five losses.</p>
        <p>''It is our hope that the spirit of athletic competition will reunite our two teams,'' Superintendent Williams wrote to the Cold Spring Harbor schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amen said he expected the games to resume. ''I've been to Roosevelt so many times,'' he said, ''and there have been no problems.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 14, 2002, Thursday  An article on Saturday about a decision by a Long Island high school, Cold Spring Harbor, to forfeit its season finale football game at Roosevelt High School because of fears about violence gave an incorrect description of a victim in a recent killing off school grounds in Roosevelt. He was a former Roosevelt student, not a current one. The article also referred imprecisely to fighting that resulted from the killing. Although the fights involved a group of students, school officials said there was no evidence that gangs were involved.</p>
