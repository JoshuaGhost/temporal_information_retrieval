        <p>Five Japanese returned to Japan after lengthy stay in North Korea after being abducted hold joint press conference announcing their decision to stay in homeland and express wish for their families to join them; Hitomi Soga, American soldier Robert Charles Jenkins' wife, declares intent to visit mother-in-law in US; Jenkins, still in North Korea, has been listed as deserter since 1965 when he disappeared near demilitarized zone; photo (S)</p>

        <p>In a symbolic step, the five Japanese kidnap victims who were returned from North Korea two months ago have appeared in public for the first time without their North Korean loyalty badges. They gave a joint news conference and said they did not plan to return to North Korea and wanted their children to move to Japan. Hitomi Soga, above, whose American husband, Robert Charles Jenkins, is also still in North Korea, said she wanted to travel to the United States to meet her mother-in-law. In 1965 Mr. Jenkins, now 62, disappeared from a United States Army patrol along the inter-Korean border and is listed as a deserter.</p>
