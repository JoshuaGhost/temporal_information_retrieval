      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A blend of ''Dr. Dolittle'' and ''Family Ties,'' the animated series ''The Wild Thornberrys'' has been a staple of the Nickleodeon children's cable network since 1998. Never shy about exploiting its brand names, Nickelodeon has now turned the program into a feature film, carrying over most of the creative personnel of the series.</p>
        <p>On screen, ''The Wild Thornberrys'' looks just as it does on television, only wider. The directors, Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, use a Cinemascope-like frame to create a cartoon Africa with a greater sweep than its television counterpart, though the visuals inevitably fall short of their obvious model, Disney's ''Lion King.'' Without the financial or creative resources of the Disney animators, ''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' remains essentially an extended Saturday morning cartoon -- which is to say, a series of hastily executed illustrations matched to a voice track.</p>

        <p>A blend of ''Dr. Dolittle'' and ''Family Ties,'' the animated series ''The Wild Thornberrys'' has been a staple of the Nickleodeon children's cable network since 1998. Never shy about exploiting its brand names, Nickelodeon has now turned the program into a feature film, carrying over most of the creative personnel of the series.</p>
        <p>On screen, ''The Wild Thornberrys'' looks just as it does on television, only wider. The directors, Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian, use a Cinemascope-like frame to create a cartoon Africa with a greater sweep than its television counterpart, though the visuals inevitably fall short of their obvious model, Disney's ''Lion King.'' Without the financial or creative resources of the Disney animators, ''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' remains essentially an extended Saturday morning cartoon -- which is to say, a series of hastily executed illustrations matched to a voice track.</p>
        <p>The Thornberrys are an Anglo-American family of five. Dad Nigel is a blustery upper-class Englishman (entertainingly voiced by Tim Curry with the rolling vowels of C. Aubrey Smith) who with his plucky American wife, Marianne (Jodi Carlisle), makes nature documentaries for public television. They have two daughters, 12-year-old Eliza (Lacey Chabert), a shy girl with glasses, braces and spots on her face that could be either freckles or acne, and Debbie (Danielle Harris), a hormonally charged teenager who pines for American shopping malls. Their little brother, Donnie (played in grunts and squeals by the rock star Flea), is a still-unsocialized wild child, discovered and adopted by the Thornberrys during one of their expeditions.</p>
        <p>The series hangs on Eliza's magical ability to talk to the animals, granted to her by an African shaman on the condition that her special skills must always remain a secret. This allows her to communicate with her favorite pet, a chimpanzee named Darwin (Tom Kane), whose posh British accent and relentless snobbishness suggest that he, too, has spent some time on the playing fields of Eton.</p>
        <p>Eliza and Darwin set out to rescue a cheetah cub who has been snatched from the veldt by a pair of high-tech poachers (Rupert Everett and Marisa Tomei). They do, though it takes them a little longer than it would on television, involving as it does the need to escape from an oppressive British boarding school (where the headmistress has the voice of Brenda Blethyn) and beat it back to the cartoon Congo.</p>
        <p>The film, which opens nationally today, is bland but harmless.</p>
        <p>''The Wild Thornberrys Movie'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the action scenes may be too suspenseful for tiny viewers.</p>
