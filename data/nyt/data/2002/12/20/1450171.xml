        <p>Spicing up a routine speech about the death penalty at the University of Illinois, Gov. George H. Ryan pardoned three men this morning who were wrongly convicted of murder. But before he ascended the podium here, Mr. Ryan had to push through a gaggle of cameras and a barrage of questions about the increasing likelihood of his own indictment in a corruption investigation.</p>

        <p>Spicing up a routine speech about the death penalty at the University of Illinois, Gov. George H. Ryan pardoned three men this morning who were wrongly convicted of murder. But before he ascended the podium here, Mr. Ryan had to push through a gaggle of cameras and a barrage of questions about the increasing likelihood of his own indictment in a corruption investigation.</p>
        <p>''Don't stick that in my face,'' the governor barked at a man with a microphone. ''You're in my way, and I wish you would look out.''</p>
        <p>And so it has been throughout Mr. Ryan's scandal-scarred administration. Every day, it seems, as many applaud him for his efforts to change the state's capital punishment system, accusations that state employees were deployed illegally on campaigns and that contracts were traded for contributions swirl ever closer to his office.</p>
        <p>Today the governor was engulfed by accusations, made in court documents filed late Wednesday, that he knew four years ago that his aides were shredding records to hide campaign misconduct.</p>
        <p>''It's something that has been a distraction for four years, but it has never deterred him,'' said a beleaguered Dennis Culloton, the governor's press secretary, who long ago began counting the days -- now 24 -- left in his boss's term. ''He remains focused on the work he has to do, and he leaves the rest of it to his lawyers and his Maker.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryan, a Republican, declined to address the court documents, based on testimony by several people cooperating with the corruption investigation, other than to say in a statement that ''there are two sides to every story'' and that his ''conscience is clear.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the governor made his speech as planned, issuing the pardons, saying he would abolish the death penalty immediately if he could, and hinting that the only thing holding him back from a blanket commutation for the 160 people remaining on death row is the anguished pleas from victims' families.</p>
        <p>In a 40-minute speech at the university's law school, the governor detailed the wrongful convictions of Rolando Cruz and Gary Gauger, two of 13 innocent men who have been freed from death row since Illinois reestablished the death penalty in 1977, and of Steven Linscott, who spent 10 years in prison for the murder of a young woman in Oak Park before DNA evidence cleared him in 1992. The pardons erase the convictions from their records.</p>
        <p>''I wish them well,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''They've been through hell.''</p>
        <p>The pardons were overshadowed, however, by accusations in the 76-page court filing, among them that during his 1998 campaign for governor, Mr. Ryan was at a meeting where his top aide, Scott Fawell, ordered an underling to destroy evidence sought by federal investigators. Mr. Fawell is one of more than 50 people facing charges in what is known as the license-for-bribes scandal, which concerns Mr. Ryan's eight years as secretary of state.</p>
        <p>The filing was the first to link the corruption conspiracy directly to the governor, and many believe it portends an indictment following his departure from office.</p>
        <p>''Here's a guy that spends all his life in politics,'' said Paul Green, a political science professor at Roosevelt University in Chicago, ''probably wanted to be governor more than anybody I've ever seen, finally got his life's dream, and it's turned out to be a nightmare.''</p>
        <p>According to the new court documents, as secretary of state Mr. Ryan helped coordinate the inappropriate use of government employees on campaigns for his niece's husband; Mr. Fawell's mother; various House candidates; and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, for president.The filing suggests he was also involved in giving state workers raises to reward them for campaign work.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors contend that on Sept. 8, 1998, after federal agents had made the first arrests in the case and had begun searching secretary of state offices, Mr. Ryan was sitting on a nearby couch while Mr. Fawell told Mr. Ryan's scheduler, William Mack, to make sure everyone in the office destroyed campaign documents right away. Mr. Fawell said to his boss, ''Hey George, I told Bill to go around and tell people to get stuff out of their offices,'' the documents contend, adding that Mr. Ryan then abruptly left the room.</p>
        <p>Despite international praise for his declaration of a moratorium on capital punishment and for his appointment of a commission that suggested its overhaul, Governor Ryan decided, amid polls indicating a plummeting popularity, not to seek reelection. A pharmacist from rural Kankakee County, he has become a solitary figure, unable to pass legislation and left trying to shape a legacy beyond being driven from the statehouse by scandal.</p>
        <p>He has said he will not decide how many death sentences to commute to life in prison until after the New Year.</p>
        <p>''We can't have a perfect system, so it probably should be abolished,'' Governor Ryan told students and professors in a packed auditorium today. ''If I could do it, I'd do it today, abolish it. But it can't happen.''</p>
        <p>Asked how he could avoid a blanket clemency order, the governor said: ''I've got to be somewhat practical in this situation, and I've got to be fair. Victims' families have very strong emotions and feelings. I'll do what I think is right.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence C. Marshall, legal director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University and the lawyer who helped free Mr. Cruz and Mr. Gauger, said the pardons amount to ''an end to the official whispering campaign'' that has hampered the exonerated men's ability to restart their lives.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Ryan emerged from the auditorium to a throng of waiting reporters, he stamped his foot and said, ''O.K., you've got a minute and a half.'' Interrupting a question about people suggesting he announced the pardons today to divert attention from the accusations against him, the governor snapped: ''I'd say you're cynics.''</p>
