      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, who was elected in 1999 as a Democrat, declared that she was switching to the Republican Party after angering Democrats over support for a tort overhaul and after supporting a Congressional redistricting plan last year that was more favorable to Republicans. Ms. Tuck, who presides over the State Senate, also announced her intention to run again next year. Flanked by Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, the state's two Republican senators, she said she also looked forward to working with the former Republican national chairman Haley Barbour, who is a probable candidate for governor in 2003.</p>
