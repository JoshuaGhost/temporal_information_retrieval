        <p>It's been more than a year since Aaliyah was killed in a plane crash, and it's no surprise that her death has changed the way people talk about her singing. Everyone seems to agree that she had ''the voice of an angel,'' as if her recording career was merely a prelude to her time in heaven.</p>
        <p>Let's make sure the myth doesn't obscure the music. Aaliyah's voice wasn't nearly warm or joyful enough to be considered angelic. She helped invent a style that might be called avant-garde R &amp; B, and she did it by recording some of the least passionate love songs in recent memory -- her favorite tools were grace and precision.</p>

        <p>It's been more than a year since Aaliyah was killed in a plane crash, and it's no surprise that her death has changed the way people talk about her singing. Everyone seems to agree that she had ''the voice of an angel,'' as if her recording career was merely a prelude to her time in heaven.</p>
        <p>Let's make sure the myth doesn't obscure the music. Aaliyah's voice wasn't nearly warm or joyful enough to be considered angelic. She helped invent a style that might be called avant-garde R &amp; B, and she did it by recording some of the least passionate love songs in recent memory -- her favorite tools were grace and precision.</p>
        <p>A posthumous collection, ''I Care 4 U'' (Blackground/Universal), is due out on Tuesday, and it pairs some of Aaliyah's biggest hits with a number of unreleased tracks.</p>
        <p>Aaliyah did most of her best work with the producer Timbaland, who balanced her glassy vocals with restive electronic compositions. On ''One in a Million,'' her vocals mimic the hiccupy beat; on ''Are You That Somebody,'' she glides above a track full of rhythmic tics; on ''Try Again,'' she seems to be playing a game with the bass line, matching its swells and fades, twists and turns.</p>
        <p>''I Care 4 U'' includes a half-dozen unreleased tracks. ''Miss You,'' the current single, uses a gentle guitar line, embellished by an odd twittering sound in the background. And ''Don't Worry,'' produced by Jazze Pha, has a beat that's so thoroughly chopped up, it's sometimes hard to follow the rhythm.</p>
        <p>The disc ends with a remix of ''Got to Give It Up,'' Aaliyah's version of the old Marvin Gaye disco track. After she sings, ''This party is jumping till the break of dawn,'' the music fades away, and her voice hovers in midair, echoing and fading, until the beat comes back.</p>
