        <p>Was there a Democrat left who had not lamented the results of the mid-term elections? As it turned out, yes there was -- Bill Clinton, who in a New York speech told his party that Democrats had ceded to Republicans the one issue that has captivated the American public: national security. As it turned out, his counsel came the same week that Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, set up a presidential exploratory committee. Mr. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear that national security and foreign affairs would be central issues he would take to President Bush should he win his party's nomination.</p>
