        <p>Magazine advertising pages are still in a seesaw pattern, rising in November after a slight decline in October, the Publishers Information Bureau in New York reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ad pages in magazines in November rose 6.9 percent compared with those in November 2001, according to the bureau's data. The gain extended the up-and-down pattern of recent months that began in July when ad pages increased 0.5 percent, their first monthly increase since December 2000. They fell 5.8 percent in August, rose 2.6 percent in September and fell 0.2 percent in October.</p>

        <p>Magazine advertising pages are still in a seesaw pattern, rising in November after a slight decline in October, the Publishers Information Bureau in New York reported yesterday.</p>

They fell 5.8 percent in August, rose 2.6 percent in September and fell 0.2 percent in October.</p>
        <p>For the first 11 months of 2002, the bureau reported, ad pages declined 4.5 percent compared with those in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>In November, there were gains in ad pages in 9 of 12 major categories; by comparison, in October, 7 of the 12 declined. The increases last month, in categories like media and advertising, automobiles and lodging, helped make November ''the strongest month in 2002 thus far,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the bureau's affiliate, the Magazine Publishers of America.</p>
