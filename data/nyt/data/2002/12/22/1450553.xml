        <p>ON a chilly November evening, the stony silence of the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is broken by the barely audible whir of technology. A boom camera swoops above some 200 people seated on wobbly folding chairs. Around their perimeter, another camera rushes on tracks toward a Neapolitan crêche shadowed by the lower branches of a Christmas tree adorned with filigreed angels. Soon, a man in a headset asks the audience to generate rounds of ''practice clapping,'' partly to test sound levels but also, perhaps, to splice into unforeseen lulls.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, 12 men in white ties and black tails begin to chant a haunting 13th-century plainsong from behind a gold-leafed screen before walking to their marks in front of the tree. Chanticleer, the a cappella choir from San Francisco, is filming its first televised concert in the United States during the ensemble's 25 years in existence. As the hymn's final note dissipates into the ether, it is clear the producer needn't have worried about uncomfortable silences. At the end of Franz Biebl's ''Ave Maria,'' audience members weep amid cheers of ''bravi!'' As Joseph Jennings, the choir's music director, sings a delicate descant in his own arrangement of ''Oh, What a Pretty Little Baby,'' the crowd is on its feet. It is not yet Thanksgiving, but for all those listening the holidays have arrived, resoundingly.</p>

        <p>ON a chilly November evening, the stony silence of the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is broken by the barely audible whir of technology. A boom camera swoops above some 200 people seated on wobbly folding chairs. Around their perimeter, another camera rushes on tracks toward a Neapolitan crêche shadowed by the lower branches of a Christmas tree adorned with filigreed angels. Soon, a man in a headset asks the audience to generate rounds of ''practice clapping,'' partly to test sound levels but also, perhaps, to splice into unforeseen lulls.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, 12 men in white ties and black tails begin to chant a haunting 13th-century plainsong from behind a gold-leafed screen before walking to their marks in front of the tree. Chanticleer, the a cappella choir from San Francisco, is filming its first televised concert in the United States during the ensemble's 25 years in existence. As the hymn's final note dissipates into the ether, it is clear the producer needn't have worried about uncomfortable silences. At the end of Franz Biebl's ''Ave Maria,'' audience members weep amid cheers of ''bravi!'' As Joseph Jennings, the choir's music director, sings a delicate descant in his own arrangement of ''Oh, What a Pretty Little Baby,'' the crowd is on its feet. It is not yet Thanksgiving, but for all those listening the holidays have arrived, resoundingly.</p>
        <p>''The acoustics are magnificent, as is the setting, with all that beautiful art in front of the tree,'' said Philip Wilder, Chanticleer's assistant music director. ''From the very beginning, we knew that concert had to be there.''</p>
        <p>They also knew the program. ''For television you have to keep things more even than you'd have to for a live performance,'' he said. ''We chose our very favorite Christmas pieces of all time'' -- works like 12th- and 13th-century European carols; a setting of John Tavener's ''Village Wedding''; and medleys of traditional carols and spirituals. And, of course, the ''Ave Maria.'' ''We've received hate mail when we don't perform it,'' Mr. Wilder said.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, holiday music specials begin in early December and are rebroadcast Christmas week. ''Christmas With Chanticleer,'' which had its premiere on Dec. 10, will be shown again on Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Channel 21 and Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>''Christmas in Washington,'' which had its premiere last Sunday, will be shown tomorrow night at 10 on TNT.</p>
        <p>''People associate the holidays with live music and traditions they can count on,'' said Michael Stevens, the show's producer. ''We have the tradition of the U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club, of a local youth choir and of the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, as well as a 35-piece orchestra.'' Those traditions are balanced by performances by popular artists like Lee Ann Womack, Alison Krauss, Brooks and Dunn, the Brian Setzer Orchestra and Yolanda Adams. ''What it's become in 21 years is the national Christmas celebration, one that the president and first lady attend every year,'' he said. ''We have a little something for everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mass appeal was one of the reasons Lorin Maazel, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, chose works by George Gershwin for his first New Year's Eve celebration with the orchestra. Comprising selections from ''Porgy and Bess,'' ''Cuban Overture'' and ''An American in Paris,'' the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' special, a first for Mr. Maazel, will be shown on Channel 13 at 8 p.m. on Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>''Gershwin's a good composer, really the best,'' he said, ''and you see, if Vienna chooses Strauss, then the question is, what represents New York? It struck me that now that I'm back home and conducting New Year's Eve for this country, why not conduct a composer that has captured the imagination of the world around? Probably more people have whistled Gershwin tunes than the 'Blue Danube.' Why not celebrate the New Year's in the New World with a new composer?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maazel, who had conducted the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's Day performance 10 times before assuming the mantle here, said he had no intention of conducting the New York concert every year. ''I feel it is important that other conductors have a chance to lend their interpretation to bringing in the new year,'' he said, ''and to give us a little variety in our revelry.''</p>
        <p>In Vienna, variety is not a high priority. In ''From Vienna: The New Year's Celebration 2003,'' a ''Great Performances'' production to be shown Jan. 1 on Channel 13 at 2:30 and 8 p.m., the Vienna Philharmonic once again resurrects the city's 19th-century splendor through the waltzes, polkas and marches of Johann Strauss. Still, one conductor's ''Blue Danube Waltz'' is not necessarily another's.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the great privileges for anybody who has any feeling at all,'' said Walter Cronkite, the concert's host for the last 19 years. ''The orchestra knows the scores so well that the conductor has very little to inject -- although their impact is very noticeable.''</p>
        <p>What this year's conductor, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, does with ''Emperor Waltz,'' ''In Praise of Women Polka'' and ''Chinese Gallop'' remains to be heard. Last year, Seiji Ozawa turned the philharmonic on its ear when he lured its brass section into renditions more usually performed by strings. ''It was a much more rousing performance, wildly applauded by the audience,'' Mr. Cronkite recalled. ''Through the years, it has been quite rewarding to see how each conductor made these works his own.''</p>
        <p>If the ''Blue Danube Waltz'' is the most popular waltz ever written, then ''The Merry Widow Waltz'' may well hold second place. The playwright Wendy Wasserstein said ''it was a wonderful thing'' when the San Francisco Opera approached her about writing the libretto for their new production of Franz Lehár's ''Merry Widow.''</p>
        <p>''There's something very gala about this kind of production,'' Ms. Wasserstein said, recalling how her mother used to hum ''Merry Widow'' waltzes around the Wasserstein household. ''I worked on it endlessly, I hummed it endlessly, but I wrote it over a Christmas holiday.'' The frothy operetta about a flirtatious grande dame who has just arrived in Paris will have its premiere as a ''Great Performances'' presentation on Wednesday at  9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>''For me, it's a fitting holiday performance, both in spirit and in form,'' Ms. Wasserstein said. ''It conjures up what's best about the season.''</p>
