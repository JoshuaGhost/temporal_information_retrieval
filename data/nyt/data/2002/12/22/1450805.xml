        <p>While the debate rages over a memorial at ground zero, the families of many victims have sought to have city streets and corners named in their loved ones' honor. But these efforts are not free of dispute, either.</p>
        <p>More than 80 such streets have already been named as part of a City Council bill enacted on Sept. 27. In Staten Island, the corner of Freeborn Street and Lincoln Avenue in the Midland Beach section is now also known as Martin J. Egan Jr. Corner, after a Fire Department captain who grew up nearby.

        <p>While the debate rages over a memorial at ground zero, the families of many victims have sought to have city streets and corners named in their loved ones' honor. But these efforts are not free of dispute, either.</p>
        <p>More than 80 such streets have already been named as part of a City Council bill enacted on Sept. 27. In Staten Island, the corner of Freeborn Street and Lincoln Avenue in the Midland Beach section is now also known as Martin J. Egan Jr. Corner, after a Fire Department captain who grew up nearby. Last Wednesday, the Council passed another bill naming 91 additional streets in honor of victims of Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>The victims' names are put on a second sign and do not affect the official street name. These personal memorials have been embraced in most neighborhoods, but there are none in Chelsea, Lower Manhattan and other areas where residents have long frowned upon this practice.</p>
        <p>In Chelsea, Community Board 4 recently rejected a request from the family of Mary Herencia, a lifelong local resident and victim of the attacks, to name a block of West 25th Street after her. Board officials argued that the new name would confuse tourists and residents, and would single out a particular victim for recognition.</p>
        <p>''Instead of naming one street, then another, then another, we wanted to think more holistically as a board,'' said Anthony Borelli, the district manager. ''Maybe a plaque or a memorial of some sort.''</p>
        <p>Plans to put the Herencia request before the City Council were dropped after it was rejected by the board. The Council has an unofficial policy of getting local approval before a street name bill is introduced.</p>
        <p>Community Board 5 in Manhattan, which covers Times Square and the Flatiron District, typically refers all such requests to the mayor's office.</p>
        <p>''Is it really the proper way to memorialize someone?'' asked Kathy Kinsella, Board 5's district manager. ''For an event of such enormous proportions, a more enormous memorial is more appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Community Board 10 in Howard Beach, Queens, also resists tinkering with street names. ''We prefer a permanent structure, such as a park or city building,'' said Rose Pepe, the district manager. ''But nothing has come before us.''</p>
        <p>The new Council has sought to free itself from time-consuming debates about street names, said Councilman Joseph Addabbo Jr. of Rockaway, Queens, chairman of the council committee that handles such requests. ''But with 9/11,'' he said, ''I did not want to show disrespect.''</p>
