        <p>Shana Cox from Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville, N.Y., set a national indoor record yesterday for 300 meters of 37.59 seconds in the 49th annual Bishop Loughlin Games at the Armory Track and Field Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The meet was the opener of the major high school indoor track season and drew entries from 227 schools from five states and Washington and over 5,000 competitors.</p>
        <p>Cox, a senior headed for Penn State next fall, blazed through the first 200 meters of the 300 in 24.5 seconds and continued the fast pace to the finish line. The previous record of 37.77 seconds was posted by Natasha Hastings of Manhattan's A.P. Randolph High School last year.</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, Hastings won the 600 meters in 1 minute 32.60 seconds and then saw Cox erase her mark in the 300. Last year, Cox won the 300 at this meet in 38.00 seconds for a national record, only to have Hastings lower the mark to 37.77 seconds.</p>
        <p>Catha and Caroline Mullen, twins from Bronxville, N.Y., led their team to two victories. Catha first took the 3,200 in 10:49.08 for a meet record with Caroline second in 10:53.35. Then the senior sisters ran two legs on Bronxville's winning 3,200-meter relay (9:33.68).</p>
        <p>New Rochelle, N.Y., paced by Karen Robinson's victories in the 55-meter dash (7.03 seconds) and the long jump at 18 feet 7 inches, both individual bests, captured the girls' team title with 27 points, followed by Bronxville with 16.</p>
        <p>In boys competition, Suido Ezike of Port Richmond on Staten Island won the 55 hurdles in 7.42 seconds; Gavin McMahon of Fordham Prep, who did 15-3 last week, had to settle yesterday for a pole-vault victory at 14-6; and Anthony Wisemon of DeMatha of Hyattsville, Md. won the 55-meter dash in 6.39.</p>
        <p>Mike Morrison, a senior from Willingboro, N.J., won the long jump at 23 feet 8i inches, and then he moved to the high jump and cleared 7 feet 2 inches, erasing his own Armory record, set last year in the meet at 7-1.</p>
