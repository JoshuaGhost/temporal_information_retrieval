        <p>Street Street has been in transition for many years.</p>
        <p>A retail district for most of its history and still home to venerable Chicago department stores like Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott, the focus started to change in 1991 with the opening of the new main public library, the Harold Washington Library Center, which occupies a block at the south end of the street bounded by State Street, Congress Parkway, Van Buren Street and South Plymouth Court.</p>

        <p>Street Street has been in transition for many years.</p>
        <p>A retail district for most of its history and still home to venerable Chicago department stores like Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott, the focus started to change in 1991 with the opening of the new main public library, the Harold Washington Library Center, which occupies a block at the south end of the street bounded by State Street, Congress Parkway, Van Buren Street and South Plymouth Court.</p>
        <p>In 1993, DePaul University established its downtown campus in the former Goldblatt's Department Store Building at the corner of State Street and Jackson Boulevard.</p>
        <p>More recently, the pace of development on the street has accelerated. Last year, Sears opened a 250,000-square-foot store at the northwest corner of State and Madison Streets in a renovated high rise that also includes 650,000 square feet of office space.</p>
        <p>Two other major office projects are under way. The first is Dearborn Center, a 1.8 million-square-foot, 37-story tower nearing completion at the corner of State and Adams Streets. The second is Sullivan Center, which is being carved out of the upper floors of Carson Pirie Scott's landmark flagship department store at the southeast corner of State and Madison Streets. That project will have 400,000 square feet of office space.</p>
        <p>In addition, the landmark Reliance Building at the southwest corner of State Street and Washington Boulevard underwent a top-to-bottom renovation in the mid-1990's and opened in 1999 as the Hotel Burnham.</p>
