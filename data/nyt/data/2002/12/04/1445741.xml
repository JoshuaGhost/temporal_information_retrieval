        <p>A State Supreme Court justice has banned the city's Tax Commission from requiring property owners to indicate that they never used the services of two major figures in New York City's tax assessor bribery scandal.</p>
        <p>The city immediately said it would appeal the decision.</p>
        <p>Justice Martin J. Schoenfeld made his ruling yesterday in a case brought by property owners who were appealing their tax assessments, as the city allowed them to do after the scandal came to light in February.</p>
        <p>In allowing the appeals, the city's Tax Commission issued a form for the appeals that specifically asks the property owners to state whether they engaged or retained ''the services and/or representation of Albert Schussler or Alan G. Edelstein,'' two real estate consultants who prosecutors say had bribed assessors to lower the tax bills for their clients. Mr. Edelstein has pleaded guilty in the case; Mr. Schussler is scheduled to go on trial in January.</p>
        <p>Fifteen city tax assessors have pleaded guilty in the scheme, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has called ''the largest and most financially damaging corruption scheme'' in city history.</p>
        <p>The ruling came in a case filed by the owners of a co-op at 438 East 88th Street who had challenged an annual assessment of $1.03 million. The co-op claimed the number should be only $600,000. It also balked at signing the form regarding Mr. Schussler and Mr. Edelstein. No appeal hearing was granted to anyone who would not sign the document.</p>
        <p>Justice Schoenfeld issued a restraining order against the Tax Commission, saying the practice was unacceptable. ''Sad to say, but the despicable acts out of which this case arose were not done to the city so much as by the city,'' he wrote. ''It appears that rank corruption existed for years, if not decades, as former city employees passed bribes to current employees.''</p>
        <p>The Tax Commission, he said, cannot force property owners to incriminate themselves or impute guilt by association with such a form.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the city's corporation counsel, Michael A. Cardozo, said: ''We are shocked and disturbed that the judge would question the city's good faith. The city and its citizens were the victims of a nefarious crime perpetrated by individuals acting in a longstanding criminal conspiracy without the knowledge of their superiors. To suggest this was done 'by' the city is outrageous.''</p>
