        <p>AOL Time Warner yesterday presented a new strategy for its AOL division to compete for high-speed Internet users, acknowledging that the service that helped make the Internet a mass medium is now in danger of falling behind as consumers seek faster connections online.</p>
        <p>AOL Time Warner said AOL was redirecting its efforts toward marketing an upgraded version of its high-speed service intended to take advantage of the elaborate multimedia potential of high-speed Internet connections, partly by offering music and videos from its sister companies. AOL said it would seek to persuade high-speed users to pay an additional monthly fee of about $15 for its service even after buying broadband access from another company for as much as $50 a month.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>AOL Time Warner yesterday presented a new strategy for its AOL division to compete for high-speed Internet users, acknowledging that the service that helped make the Internet a mass medium is now in danger of falling behind as consumers seek faster connections online.</p>
        <p>AOL Time Warner said AOL was redirecting its efforts toward marketing an upgraded version of its high-speed service intended to take advantage of the elaborate multimedia potential of high-speed Internet connections, partly by offering music and videos from its sister companies. AOL said it would seek to persuade high-speed users to pay an additional monthly fee of about $15 for its service even after buying broadband access from another company for as much as $50 a month.</p>
        <p>In some respects, the new strategy runs counter to what appeared to be one of the cardinal lessons of the last decade in the Internet business: very few companies have been able to charge money for online information or entertainment, no matter how splashy or exclusive. Yahoo, an AOL rival, has also recently tried selling users subscriptions to exclusive online content, with disappointing results.</p>
        <p>But Jonathan Miller, recently named chairman of the AOL division, argued that with the end of the boom in online advertising, online media companies would increasingly charge for access to their contents. ''In order to support terrific content on the Internet there has to be a dual revenue stream -- advertising and subscriptions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The shift in emphasis is a radical departure for AOL, which most of its 35 million subscribers think of as the service that connects them to the Internet at low speeds over phone lines. AOL will continue providing those services but will direct more of its programming and marketing energy toward its new high-speed capabilities. Instead of concentrating on selling its service as a way to reach to the Internet, AOL now aims to sell subscriptions to its high-speed service as an add-on for users who also pay monthly fees for high-speed access from their phone or cable companies.</p>
        <p>For example, a customer who buys high-speed access to the Internet from a cable company might pay an extra fee to AOL to use AOL's e-mail, instant messaging, multimedia and shopping features.</p>
        <p>But AOL is asking customers to reach deep into their pockets. Cable and phone companies typically charge more than $40 a month for high-speed access to the Internet, including their own e-mail and instant messaging services. AOL is charging an additional $14.95 for its high-speed service as well.</p>
        <p>''If the price creeps up to $60, that will be a difficult sale,'' said Michael Lunsford, executive vice president for customer experience at the rival Internet service Earthlink, ''particularly if you are paying for e-mail and basic services from your cable provider and again from AOL.''</p>
        <p>Success selling the high-speed service may also prove taxing to AOL itself. Providing broadband service is more costly and less profitable to AOL than providing low-speed service for $24.95 a month. Although AOL previously offered a high-speed version of its service, it refrained from marketing or promoting it for fear of hurting its low-speed profits. As a result, about half of the roughly four million subscribers who use a high-speed version of AOL are unaware of the $14.95 add-on offer and still pay $24.95 a month for the service as well as $40 a month for high-speed access.</p>
        <p>Competition is forcing the company's hand. Growth is slowing in AOL's core low-speed business as online users increasingly reach the Internet over high-speed connections from cable and phone companies. AOL previously sought to reach those users by making deals with cable and phone companies to offer its service to customers who seek high-speed connections. But the telecommunications companies were slow to sign on, in part because they sell their own Internet access services.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, AOL Time Warner executives said the change in strategy was partly a recognition that during the fat years of the Internet boom AOL's executives took their eyes off incipient industry trends like movement toward high-speed access. Speaking after the presentation, AOL Time Warner's chairman, Stephen M. Case, said AOL's executives had been distracted by cashing in on big deals to sell online advertising, capitalizing on its members instead of catering to them.</p>
        <p>Much of its Internet advertising business has since disappeared, and yesterday AOL Time Warner said it expected the AOL division's online advertising revenue to decline as much as 50 percent next year as its old deals expire. The company said it expected the division's total revenue next year to be roughly flat from this year, but it projected that the decline in its profitable advertising business would lower its cash flow by 15 percent to 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, the chairman of the AOL division, said he expected the division to turn around after next year. He said that, excluding its many old deals, the company's ad revenue was already beginning to recover, albeit more slowly.</p>
        <p>AOL Time Warner's share price fell $2.36 yesterday, to $14.21.</p>
        <p>Speaking after the presentation, Mr. Case said the company's new strategy was an effort to catch up. ''Would it be better if we did some of this earlier? Yes, but we are where we are, and we are going to move forward,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AOL's new strategy has different consequences for different groups of its current subscribers. As part of its strategy, the company said that it would begin aiming its marketing and services at subscribers according to the patterns of their use. Some users who are not very profitable for AOL may receive less customer service. Users who increase AOL's telecommunications expenses by spending a lot of time online on their low-speed connections may be encouraged more aggressively to switch to buying broadband access from another company, lowering the cost to AOL.</p>
        <p>Low-speed and high-speed users may also find that AOL is seeking to sell them additional services for an extra monthly fee as it seeks to help make up for its declining advertising revenue. AOL is already selling monthly subscriptions to voice services. One service takes phone messages while subscribers use the phone line for access to the Internet. Another allows users to hear their e-mail messages over the phone. The company plans a service to deliver voice messages in e-mail. AOL is also beginning to sell subscriptions to online security services, and plans later to add subscriptions to the online music service MusicNet.</p>
        <p>AOL will also seek to sell its subscribers more goods and services. AOL previously directed its members outside of its service to the Web sites of advertisers to make purchases. To offset the increasing costs of its broadband effort, however, AOL now hopes to keep a larger proportion of the money its members spend online, beginning by selling CD's on parts of its service related to music and expanding its sales of discounted merchandise. The company said it planned to seek other areas for online commerce as well.</p>
        <p>In their presentation to investors, however, AOL executives most emphasized the way that AOL was incorporating new contents into its service, many of them from its sister companies within AOL Time Warner. For example, the company said that HBO would help produce an online comedy for AOL, although it did not provide details.</p>
        <p>AOL executives demonstrated a host of new offerings, including access to some video clips from Warner Brothers movies, content from Time Inc. publications, and songs from Warner Brothers music available to download for 99 cents each.</p>
        <p>A new version of AOL's software for high-speed users will allow subscribers to receive selected sound and video material like CNN news reports as they log on.</p>
        <p>AOL also demonstrated what it said was a streamlined integration of media into its popular communications services like e-mail and instant messaging, including an improved ability to send photographs, video clips and music. In one demonstration, a user sent another a movie clip with a link to buy tickets at a nearby theater. In another, a subscriber clicked a button to order a print of a photograph sent by another user.</p>
        <p>''The good news is they have clear goals of what needs to be done,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''But it's not clear if they can do it.''</p>
