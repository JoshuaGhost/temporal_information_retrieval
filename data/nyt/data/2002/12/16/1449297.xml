        <p>All sorts of prominent people are busy apologizing for their mistakes. Many more could be doing the same, and maybe will some day -- if they get in enough trouble. Public apologies, it would seem, come only when all else fails.</p>

        <p>IT'S the sorry season. Pun intended.</p>
        <p>All sorts of prominent people are busy apologizing for their mistakes. Many more could be doing the same, and maybe will some day -- if they get in enough trouble. Public apologies, it would seem, come only when all else fails.</p>
        <p>The sorriest public official around is, of course, Trent Lott, the Republican Senate leader who said that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been elected president when he ran as a segregationist in 1948. Mr. Lott talked himself into so much trouble that he has had to try to talk himself out of it and may have set a new record -- time and time again in the past week.</p>
        <p>This past week was also when Cardinal Bernard F. Law resigned as archbishop of Boston after months of criticism for his handling of sex abuse claims against priests. Henry A. Kissinger also resigned as chairman of the new commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, saying he felt he had to step down if continuing to serve meant he would have to disclose his business clients.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Law apologized. Mr. Kissinger did not apologize for failing to recognize before he accepted the appointment that he would have to reveal his client list.</p>
        <p>No apologies from him. None either from Pete Rose, who would have to admit to many instances of wrongdoing, including betting on baseball, to be considered eligible for the Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Or from Republican senators who carefully waited to object to Mr. Lott's remarks until President Bush led the way with a strongly critical statement. Or, for that matter, from Democratic senators who gave their fellow Democrat, Robert G. Torricelli, a pass for ethical lapses earlier this year, until he looked as if he would lose them their committee chairmanships. They found their voices when Mr. Torricelli of New Jersey dropped out of his re-election race in October, when his ethical problems looked as though they'd cost him his re-election to the Senate -- endangering the Democratic majority in the Senate. Which Democrats lost anyway.</p>
        <p>In the city, the public has gotten no apologies from those corrupt judges in Brooklyn who dared to sit in judgment of others, or from the politicians who got them their jobs.</p>
        <p>Nor has the public gotten any apologies for the inconvenience and tension caused by the threat of a transit strike. The city has been on edge for weeks, the public discourse even got overheated when Roger Toussaint, the president of the transit union local, told the mayor to ''shut up.'' When will he say he's sorry?</p>
        <p>Nor has he or anyone else apologized for bringing the city -- which has been through more than enough trauma -- to the brink.</p>
        <p>The union need not have insisted all these weeks for a new settlement on the expiration date of its old contract. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority could say it's sorry for failing to anticipate the seriousness of the strike threat, for alienating the rank and file, for letting the contract expire in the Christmas season. Where was the leadership?</p>
        <p>THERE is an answer: waiting. Everything went on hold pending Election Day. Gov. George E. Pataki could make the admission that the transportation authority -- which he controls -- could have begun serious negotiations with the union long ago. But everything of any political or fiscal significance went on hold during his re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>The governor as candidate was opaque about the state budget gap and the likelihood of a transit fare increase and never even entertained the possibility of a strike. Not that he has become more forthcoming since. He said at a news conference with Mr. Bloomberg yesterday, for instance, what he was not doing: he was not involved in the transit talks.</p>
        <p>The willfully uninvolved presumably have nothing to be sorry about since they didn't do anything.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, new to the job -- and to politics -- has tried to be a cheerleader, even selecting his own strike symbol. A bicycle. A 24-speed bike with all the trimmings that cost him $663. Respectfully, a symbol worth dropping. If the mayor was trying to connect with the average New Yorker, he might consider that there are probably not many average New Yorkers who can buy a bicycle like that, or risk cycling through tunnels and across bridges in bad weather and traffic -- and without the benefit of a city security detail.</p>
        <p>Not a big deal in the apology sweeps, though. Mr. Bloomberg will have to do better than that. Actually, much worse.</p>
