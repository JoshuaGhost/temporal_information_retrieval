        <p>Marion Knight, a rap music executive known as Suge, was arrested and held in jail after the authorities said he had violated his 1995 parole by associating with gang members. Investigators said they found evidence against him after raiding his house in Malibu and the office of his company in Beverly Hills, Tha Row Records, in connection with two homicides. Mr. Knight, 37, who is not a suspect in the killings, was released on parole 16 months after serving five years in prison for violating probation on assault charges. A hearing next month will determine whether he is returned to prison for as long as a year.</p>
