        <p>First, a Jet was accused of hitting a man dressed like Santa Claus. Then, the Jets started hitting each other.</p>
        <p>In one weird day, the feel-good world of the Jets turned upside down. The day began with news that a limousine driver wearing a Santa Claus hat and a red vest with white furry trim had accused a Jets player of pushing him to the ground Monday night, breaking his kneecap. That was followed this afternoon by a series of escalating brawls involving at least 10 Jets players, including Kevin Mawae, Jason Fabini and Shaun Ellis. The fights cut short practice and had players screaming at one another, all of it playing out before a dozen visiting schoolchildren.</p>

        <p>First, a Jet was accused of hitting a man dressed like Santa Claus. Then, the Jets started hitting each other.</p>
        <p>In one weird day, the feel-good world of the Jets turned upside down. The day began with news that a limousine driver wearing a Santa Claus hat and a red vest with white furry trim had accused a Jets player of pushing him to the ground Monday night, breaking his kneecap. That was followed this afternoon by a series of escalating brawls involving at least 10 Jets players, including Kevin Mawae, Jason Fabini and Shaun Ellis. The fights cut short practice and had players screaming at one another, all of it playing out before a dozen visiting schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>Nassau County police have contacted the Jets about the incident with the limousine driver and plan to be at the Jets' facility on Friday to question players about what occurred. Today, the police were reluctant to even state that a Jets player had been accused in the incident, and it was not even clear that the police were certain of the player's identity.</p>
        <p>But Coach Herman Edwards said that he knows which player was involved and that the incident occurred after a regular gathering of the team's offensive linemen at a Long Island steakhouse. A person familiar with the investigation said the accused player is a backup, not a starter.</p>
        <p>A patron who was at the restaurant, Rothmann's Steakhouse on Northern Boulevard in East Norwich, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that a large group of offensive linemen was having dinner in a private room. At one point, they sent three or four rookies out to sing ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' to all the restaurant's patrons. The patron could not identify the players but said they had been drinking, smoking cigars and being boisterous.</p>
        <p>Frank Laine, the lawyer for the limousine driver, Donald Matinsky, 60, said he had picked up several players outside the restaurant about 11:15 p.m. Monday. With four players already in the car, Laine said, a fifth player, who Laine said was ''drunk and disorderly,'' staggered out of the restaurant and, with arms flailing, dived into the car with the others.</p>
        <p>Laine said the driver asked the drunken player to get out.</p>
        <p>''That's when the altercation happened,'' Laine said. ''He got out and pushed him onto the roadway.''</p>
        <p>Somebody helped Matinsky into the restaurant, Laine said, and the players left. Matinsky was taken to a hospital where, the police said, he was found to have a slight fracture of the left knee. Detective Lt. Steven Skrynecki of the Nassau County Police Department said the incident could qualify for a misdemeanor charge of third-degree assault.</p>
        <p>''It's possible that a member of the Jets is involved,'' Lieutenant Skrynecki said. ''It's also possible they may not be.''</p>
        <p>Edwards said: ''I know who's involved in it but I'm not talking about it. That's why you have lawyers.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, the Jets endured embarrassing headlines when two offensive linemen, Fabini and Jumbo Elliot, were arrested after a Long Island bar brawl in which several patrons and three police officers were injured. Matt O'Dwyer, a former Jets offensive lineman who had moved on to the Cincinnati Bengals, was also arrested.</p>
        <p>Elliott, who admitted punching a bar patron and urinating in a woman's bathroom sink, was ultimately fined $250 and ordered to perform 50 hours of community service. O'Dwyer, who kicked out a police car window, was sentenced to three years' probation and fined $4,373. Fabini received a lesser sentence. Meanwhile, the N.F.L. suspended Elliott and O'Dwyer for two games and fined Fabini $14,000, the equivalent of his salary for one game.</p>
        <p>Fabini remains a starter on the Jets; Elliott is a backup.</p>
        <p>It is not clear if Fabini and Elliott both attended Monday's dinner. Mawae said he did, but said he was not present when the incident took place. But he was in the middle of today's free-for-all on the field.</p>
        <p>In all, there were three fights during the Jets' final 30 minutes of practice. The first involved defensive end Bryan Thomas, a rookie, and Fabini shoving each other.</p>
        <p>Fabini tried to swing at Thomas, but he did not land a punch. A little later, with the Jets practicing without pads and without contact, Mawae blindsided Thomas far away from a reverse play that the Jets' first-team offense was running against the second-team defense. The hit left Thomas flat on his back for several seconds.</p>
        <p>The starting defensive players on the sideline were livid, and linebacker Mo Lewis walked onto the field yelling: ''That's not right! That's not right!''</p>
        <p>Soon the first-team defense took the field against the backup offense and the retaliation began. Ellis, a third-year defensive end, who has been involved in fights at practice (including one with Mawae in this year's training camp), punched offensive tackle Chris Smith in the neck.</p>
        <p>Smith went down and at least 10 Jets jumped into the ensuing melee, with the entire scene playing out before an impassive Edwards, who stood about 10 yards from the pile, his arms folded.</p>
        <p>Nearby stood Mawae, who was not involved in the second fracas. But as the fight broke up, his backup, Dennis O'Sullivan yelled sarcastically: ''Thanks, Kevin. Thanks a lot. We got it.'' That was apparently in reference to the fact that the backup offensive linemen were pummeled because of Mawae's hit on Thomas.</p>
        <p>Edwards, who hates fighting and usually throws battling players out of practice, blew the whistle to end practice three plays short of its scheduled conclusion. After talking to players for several minutes, he left them in the middle of the field for a players-only meeting.</p>
        <p>''I hope we play like that on Sunday,'' said Edwards, who appeared more amused than angered by the fights and said never in his N.F.L. career had he witnessed so many brawls in one day.</p>
        <p>''Anxiety, I guess,'' he said. ''I have no idea. I look at it as guys at the end of the season have a lot of stuff on their mind. There's a lot of anxiety, obviously. They need to figure it out.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't clear if they did. After the players' meeting at midfield, during which Mawae spoke, the offensive linemen had their own meeting. During that one, Mawae and O'Sullivan continued to yell at each other. The Jets' defensive coordinator, Ted Cottrell, said the whole thing looked like World Wrestling Entertainment.</p>
        <p>When Edwards was asked what was planned for Friday, he said, ''Round 2.''</p>
