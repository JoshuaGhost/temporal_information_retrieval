        <p>It's been one of the great mysteries of city budgeting.</p>
        <p>In the years between 1999 and 2001, the combined government annual spending for child care for the city rose by $105 million, or 21 percent, but the number of child care slots available has grown only 8 percent. Child care advocates wanted to know: Why the discrepancy?</p>
        <p>A report by the Independent Budget Office released yesterday says the new money went in part to raising salaries of child care workers and to increasing the subsidy to low-income families to reduce their fees. (A family making $25,000 with three children now pays $42 a week for child care instead of $62.)</p>
        <p>However, the city and state also used the flood of new funds, which were largely from the federal government, to steer local money previously going to child care toward other needs. In fact, the budget office reports that as the federal contribution for child care has grown, the state took money and steered it toward domestic violence and other social service programs. The city, meanwhile, has recently been reducing its own contributions toward child care -- in 2002, city financing was $29 million less than in 1999.</p>
        <p>''In total, the pluses outweighed the minuses,'' the report concluded. It pointed out that most of the funds did go to improving child care, if not adding more than minimal new slots.</p>
        <p>But child care advocates expressed frustration that the increase in federal financing had led the city and state to spend so much less.</p>
        <p>''If we had started at the base at the time we got additional funding and all that funding had gone to child care, we would have been able to serve 30,000 more children,'' said Nancy Kolben, the executive director of Child Care Inc., a child care resource and referral service.</p>
