        <p>Chile, after enduring ridicule for its attitudes and being chastised by human rights orgns for suppressing free expression, is finally ending censorship system that has kept some of world's most popular and admired movies from being shown publicly; among films it has been illegal to exhibit or view for nearly 30 years have been Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris, Woody Allen's Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex and Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night; Chile is probably most socially conservative nation in Latin America, in large part because Roman Catholic Church is even more powerful there than in neighboring countries (M)</p>

        <p>For nearly 30 years, it has been illegal here to exhibit or view the Bernardo Bertolucci film ''Last Tango in Paris.'' The same prohibition has also been applied to Woody Allen's ''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex,'' Ingmar Bergman's ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' and hundreds of other motion pictures.</p>
        <p>Now, though, that peculiar situation is about to end.

        <p>For nearly 30 years, it has been illegal here to exhibit or view the Bernardo Bertolucci film ''Last Tango in Paris.'' The same prohibition has also been applied to Woody Allen's ''Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex,'' Ingmar Bergman's ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' and hundreds of other motion pictures.</p>
        <p>Now, though, that peculiar situation is about to end. After enduring ridicule for its attitudes and being chastised by human rights organizations for suppressing free expression, this nation of 15 million people is finally ending a censorship system that has kept some of the world's most popular and admired movies from being shown publicly here.</p>
        <p>''This is a new step in favor of personal liberties and the dignity of the individual,'' President Ricardo Lagos said in signing the bill this week. It goes into effect on Jan. 1, just in time for the peak Southern Hemisphere summer movie season, and theaters and film societies are lining up to be the first to show forbidden works.</p>
        <p>Though its embrace of laissez-faire economic policies suggests a certain libertarian inclination, Chile is probably the most socially conservative nation in Latin America, in large part because the Roman Catholic Church is even more powerful here than in neighboring countries. Divorce is prohibited here, for instance, and abortion is forbidden even to save a woman's life.</p>
        <p>''We have lived too much time with the Opus Dei all over us, dominated by obscurantism,'' the Chilean film director Orlando Lubbert told a local newspaper. ''It is time to come out of our shell.'' Opus Dei is a conservative Catholic lay group.</p>
        <p>Since the censorship board began more than 75 years ago, 1,092 movies have been prohibited here. Most, to judge by their titles, are simply pornographic, but films by directors including Federico Fellini, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Pedro Almod√≥var and Oliver Stone have also been banned.</p>
        <p>During the right-wing military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, from 1973 to 1990, military officers routinely banned or ordered huge cuts in any movie that aroused their ire or suspicion.</p>
        <p>At one point, even a movie as innocuous as ''Fiddler on the Roof'' was prohibited, on the ground that too many of its characters were Russians. But the military censors were especially alarmed by politically charged movies like ''Missing,'' about the disappearance of an American citizen here during the coup that brought General Pinochet to power, or Mr. Stone's ''Salvador.''</p>
        <p>More recently, censors have also banned movies that they considered blasphemous, ranging from the Monty Python comedy ''The Life of Brian'' to Martin Scorsese's ''The Last Temptation of Christ.''</p>
        <p>Approval of the law does not mean the end of the censorship council. Instead, the board will now assign one of four ratings to movies and, in a move that has caused controversy, its membership is to be increased from 12 to 21, with psychologists, film directors and critics entering in place of army officers and judges.</p>
        <p>During congressional debate of the changes, a conservative legislator argued that it was imperative the military remain represented on the board, given the number of war movies that would be screened. That led an opponent to reply that in view of the even larger number of films with sexual themes, the same logic would seem to demand that a prostitute be appointed.</p>
