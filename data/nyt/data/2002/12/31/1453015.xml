        <p>Although his tenure will not exceed 11 days, Leon Johnson will become the first African-American to hold statewide office when he is sworn in as attorney general on Jan. 3. Mr. Johnson, 41, a Little Rock lawyer, was appointed by Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Attorney General Mark Pryor, who was elected to the United States Senate. State Senator Mike Beebe, Mr. Pryor's elected successor, will replace him on Jan. 14. As an interim state judge in 2000, Mr. Johnson presided over the disbarment case in which former President Bill Clinton agreed to surrender his law license for five years.</p>
