        <p>HAZAN-Alfred. The Sephardic Congregation of Long Beach mourns the great loss of our esteemed Trustee and benefactor. Mr. Alfred Hazan was a distinguished gentleman, a righteous individual, a man of humility, blessed with a noble heart, whose philanthropic ways touched countless lives throughout the world. For close to half a century Mr. Hazan generously gave of himself and graciously supported us. Our sanctuary, our Talmud Torah and our library were all dedicated by him and his beloved family. Our congregation shares the sorrow and extends our condolences to Jennie, Ira, Marilyn and the entire family. Alfred Hazan will be sorely missed and always remembered with deep appreciation, respect and affection. Asher H. Abittan, Rabbi Ely Altarac, Administrator David Bibi, President</p>
