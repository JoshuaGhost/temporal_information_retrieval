        <p>An article on Monday about the Kennedy Center Honors misstated Thomas Jefferson's connection to an antique desk displayed in the State Department's Diplomatic Reception Rooms, the site of an award dinner. While the rooms indeed house the desk at which the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and another desk once owned by Jefferson, he did not sign the treaty. The American signers were John Adams, John Jay and Benjamin Franklin. A correction in this space yesterday included a fourth American erroneously; David Hartley was British.</p>
