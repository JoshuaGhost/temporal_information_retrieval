        <p>When Robert D. Johnson, a young historian, agreed to join the Brooklyn College faculty three years ago, professors there could not believe their good fortune. He had two Harvard degrees, two books published by Harvard University Press and rave reviews from students and colleagues at other colleges where he had taught.</p>
        <p>Now some Brooklyn professors are sorry he ever set foot on their Midwood campus.</p>
        <p>As they tell it, in just three years, he turned from a brilliant scholar into someone so consumed by arrogance that he disdained colleagues' opinions, disparaged them to students and broke college rules about who could take his classes.</p>
        <p>This fall, Brooklyn's president, Christoph M. Kimmich, following the recommendation of several faculty committees, rejected his application for early promotion, which would have brought tenure; his department also recommended that he not be reappointed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Johnson has battled back, alleging bias and procedural violations, and turning what began as a routine request for promotion into a bitter battle over academic collegiality that has attracted nationwide attention.</p>
        <p>As Brooklyn students expressed support for their professor and Brooklyn professors traded barbs in a local newspaper and over the Internet, two dozen historians from Harvard, Columbia and other universities have rallied to Mr. Johnson's defense, calling him one of the ''most accomplished young historians in the country'' and condemning what they called a ''culture of mediocrity'' at Brooklyn College.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen someone so eminently qualified being turned away on issues that relate so little to the core of what we do, which is teaching and scholarship,'' said Charles B. Dew, a Williams College professor.</p>
        <p>But professors at Brooklyn College, a commuter campus with 15,000 students that is part of the City University of New York, say indignantly that it is impossible for outsiders to understand how disruptive Mr. Johnson has been.</p>
        <p>''It is outrageous that reputable scholars would go on at such length about the awful treatment accorded Johnson when they've heard only his side of the story,'' said Edwin G. Burrows, a Pulitzer Prize-winning member of Brooklyn's history faculty.</p>
        <p>To the dismay of Mr. Johnson's critics, Dr. Kimmich has extended his appointment another year, admonishing him that cooperating with other faculty members ''is an essential element in meeting the criteria of teaching, scholarship and service.'' Beyond that, Mr. Johnson's future remains in limbo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said he hoped the reappointment signaled that the college recognized the ''grave procedural flaws'' in its decision on his promotion and would reverse it. ''But after the last 11 months,'' he said, ''I've learned not to be too hopeful.''</p>
        <p>Were it not for his signature bow tie, Mr. Johnson could easily be mistaken for just another student in khakis and running shoes. But his voice is deep and authoritative, and he exudes confidence in his knowledge of his field. At 34, his publication list outstrips those of many senior historians, and includes several books on Congressional dissenters and American foreign policy. He has edited or helped edit two volumes of Lyndon B. Johnson's tapes, which will soon be published. He has also completed the draft of a book about Johnson and the 1964 election, to be published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company. ''The work is basically my existence,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The son of two teachers, Mr. Johnson, known as KC (after his mother's idol, the Boston Celtics star K. C. Jones), said he knew by the time he was in the ninth grade that he wanted to teach. Once he started, he won steady accolades, including a distinguished teaching award at Harvard. Last year, after he filled in at Columbia University, students petitioned the history department to hire him. ''That never happened to me before,'' said Alan Brinkley, the department chairman.</p>
        <p>For a while, all went well at Brooklyn. Mr. Johnson taught courses in 20th-century American history and foreign relations and won a fervent following among students.</p>
        <p>Colleagues and administrators were also impressed, and they showered him with honors and responsibilities. He was named acting head of the college's new honors program, assigned to a universitywide history initiative, elected to his departmental appointments committee and chosen to lead a search for a new faculty member.</p>
        <p>Reviews of Mr. Johnson's teaching were enthusiastic. Mr. Burrows, the Pulitzer-winning professor, declared Mr. Johnson an ''exceptional teacher'' with an ''enviable rapport with his class,'' and said his class was one of the best he had observed.</p>
        <p>Philip F. Gallagher, the department chairman, gave Mr. Johnson the kind of review that most young professors only dream of. He praised Mr. Johnson's ''generous and effective'' commitment to his colleagues and said his performance on two search committees had been, at times, ''little short of electrifying.'' He also advised Mr. Johnson to put himself up for tenure and promotion a year ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>But last winter, the relationship began to sour during a search for a professor of European history. Committee members, including Mr. Johnson as well as people with whom he had already had differences, disagreed not only on the candidates, but also on the process, and Mr. Johnson's behavior became an issue.</p>
        <p>Early in the search, Mr. Johnson and a colleague charged that the committee's chairwoman was being heavy-handed in telling them what questions to ask. The chairwoman and others charged that Mr. Johnson was trying to bully the committee into accepting his views and that he would not listen to others who he believed had not scrutinized candidates' records as carefully as he had.</p>
        <p>Later in the search, Mr. Johnson also disagreed with some colleagues over whether candidates they favored were strong enough for Brooklyn to hire. When he adamantly opposed making a candidate he saw as weak a finalist, some colleagues felt he was unduly uncooperative. In an e-mail message, Mr. Gallagher lambasted Mr. Johnson's comparison of the candidate with a junior professor who had left the department as ''preposterous, specious and demeaning.''</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon for academic hiring decisions to divide departments, as it did here. What it meant for Mr. Johnson was that some of his strongest backers -- Mr. Gallagher among them -- began to question his behavior on many fronts. There appears to have been no single act that turned the department chairman and other former supporters against Mr. Johnson. Rather, it was a growing perception that he had an independent, contrary streak that left others angry.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gallagher discovered in late December that Mr. Johnson had assumed responsibility for several graduate students who were officially assigned to someone else, he put the rest of Mr. Johnson's teaching load under a magnifying glass, and found several instances in which he said Mr. Johnson had overstepped his authority. In one case, Mr. Johnson conceded that he had skirted the rules. But in another, involving students who were allowed to take classes without the prerequisites, Mr. Johnson confronted the chairman with data showing that many professors had done the same thing.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Johnson's supporters say that his infractions were minor and that any professor willing to shoulder as much extra teaching as Mr. Johnson shouldered deserved thanks, not criticism. But for faculty members sensitive about whether Mr. Johnson was being presumptuous, the incidents came across as evidence that he was flouting college rules and scorning his chairman's authority.</p>
        <p>Increasingly worried about his status, Mr. Johnson copied his evaluations and dug out old e-mail messages. Over the summer, he wrote a legal brief. He sent the package to Brooklyn's president and CUNY's chancellor. When they did not intervene, he distributed the documents more widely.</p>
        <p>This week, Jay Hershenson, a CUNY spokesman, said that the chancellor was ''reviewing the matter in light of questions raised about the fairness of the process.''</p>
