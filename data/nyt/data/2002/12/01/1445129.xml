        <p>New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg came into office preaching hard-nosed fiscal prudence, but proposed austerity budget, which includes new taxes, appears more politically derived than business oriented; applies some private-sector approaches such as conducting negotiations secretly and introducing tax ideas at last minute, but as businessman never embraced traditional style of slashing costs; there is general feeling in business community that he is doing what is necessary, though many in real estate oppose property tax increase; photo (L)</p>

        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came into office preaching hard-nosed fiscal prudence. He would be a self-financed nonpolitician whose independence from special interest groups would let him apply strong medicine to the city's fiscal ills, and damn the political consequences.</p>
        <p>But now the dust has settled on Mr. Bloomberg's first austerity plan, and it looks more like a conventional politician's approach to budget cutting than that of a bottom-line businessman's. The plans to plug a $1 billion gap this fiscal year and a $6 billion hole next year call for roughly $3 in tax increases to every $2 in budget cuts, anathema to many people in business who believe that higher taxes will drive businesses and families from the city, or who at least want to see the mix of taxes and cuts reversed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg is seeking to tax commuters at the same rates city residents would pay, in addition to the 18.5 percent property tax rate increase imposed on city residents last week. And most of the cuts in the city's current budget will not affect city services, but will instead be one-time savings on things like heat, light, power and debt service.</p>
        <p>In negotiating union contracts, Mr. Bloomberg has extracted few of the kinds of productivity enhancements private-sector employers demand during hard times, and the mayor offered one group, teachers, a handsome raise. Layoffs, he has insisted, should be a last resort.</p>
        <p>Further, Mr. Bloomberg's budget calls for substantial help from Albany and Washington, a classic tactic that more often than not is rejected, especially when the state and federal government have their own deficits. It was that type of predictive budgeting that led Standard &amp; Poor's to change the city's credit outlook to ''negative'' from ''stable,'' last week.</p>
        <p>And in exchange for the tax increase, Mr. Bloomberg allowed the City Council to protect the classic sacred cows of every municipal budget fight, like firehouses, centers for the elderly and day care slots.</p>
        <p>''Somebody who was electing a businessman did not sign on for the biggest tax increase in 30 years,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative group. ''And I don't think you would find a businessperson or even an economist who would agree with Bloomberg that tax increases will have no effect on the city. This budget is indistinguishable from a guy who does owe things to everybody.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the current budget modification, which takes the city to July 1, appears to belong as much to the overwhelmingly Democratic City Council as it does to Mr. Bloomberg, and is hard to distinguish from many of this Republican mayor's predecessors.</p>
        <p>''I would have done exactly what he did,'' said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. ''There is no other way to balance a budget other than to cut expenses and increase revenues. This deficit was handed to him by Giuliani, and I think the mix is what you would have expected for this reason.''</p>
        <p>And there may be another reason. Although Mr. Bloomberg spent his entire career in the private sector, it was never his style, even during rough patches, to apply the traditional corporate method of slashing costs and eliminating jobs. Mr. Bloomberg, whose company's success was based principally on service, appears constitutionally opposed to cutting back, even on programs that benefit just a few.</p>
        <p>''He is not a guy out of corporate,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, a business group. ''Most people who know him and know his career know that it is going to be difficult for him to think of retrenchment, because he is an entrepreneurial growth guy. He believes service is the way to build a business, and to build a brand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg did apply some private-sector approaches to this budget. He conducted his negotiations as secretly as possible, and introduced both tax ideas at the last minute, pushing the property tax increase through the City Council in record time, with almost no public discourse. ''The Bloomberg opponents got one day to scream and yell and at the end of the day it had to be done and it was done bloodlessly,'' said Bruce C. Ratner, the president of Forest City Ratner Companies, a real estate development company. The plan to tax commuters needs Albany's approval, which looks doubtful.</p>
        <p>The mayor's press secretary, Edward Skyler, rejects the idea that Mr. Bloomberg's budget does not reflect a tough businessman at the helm, arguing that raising fees and taking the police force to its lowest levels in years (primarily though attrition) reflect a budget free of partisan ideology.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you'd find many people willing to ask the police and fire commissioners to cut their budgets in the wake of 9/11,'' Mr. Skyler said. ''But he has, and he got real savings from that. I don't think you're ever going to find a mayor who wants to cut the Department of the Aging, but he found savings there. Most mayors would not want to ask the Parks Department to raise its fees or the Finance Department to double the fine of a parking ticket. He has taken action after action that he knows will be unpopular but that he knows has to be done.''</p>
        <p>New York's business community has three basic segments. There are the small business owners and the heads of major corporations, many of whom have been delighted by the increased attention they have gotten from City Hall under the Bloomberg administration.</p>
        <p>Then there are the real estate leaders, who enjoyed years of close relations with City Hall and gobs of tax breaks, ostensibly to keep their tenants in the city. They are now fuming that they were not properly consulted about tax increases. ''I can't tell you that I am happy with his fiscal policies,'' said Stephen B. Siegel, chief executive officer of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Some of his proposals like that tax will positively damage our business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel said he voted for Mr. Bloomberg, but had he anticipated a property tax increase, ''I would have given it more consideration.''</p>
        <p>Unlike his situation in business, Mr. Bloomberg is hemmed in by many state and federal requirements that account for well over half of the city's budget. Further, the city is a virtual slave to Wall Street, whose fortunes tend to determine those of the city.</p>
        <p>And antipolitician though the mayor may be, he has no choice but to work with people in the city and state governments who are looking ahead to their next terms. The thought has been widely expressed that Mr. Bloomberg, who now says he did not talk about taxes last year because the city was too vulnerable after the terrorist attacks, was keeping the matter under wraps while Gov. George E. Pataki wrapped up his own re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>This theme of businessman versus the political system is likely to define the next three years of Mr. Bloomberg's mayoralty. ''You learn in government that you are moving a supertanker, not a dinghy,'' said Peter J. Solomon, who runs his own investment banking firm and is well known on Wall Street. ''Municipal government does not control its revenue or most of its expenses, because so many are mandated by other governments or collective-bargaining agreements. Gaining control takes much longer.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bloomberg has made it clear that he thinks quality-of-life improvements like safe subways, clean streets and an absence of visible homelessness are ultimately more important to business leaders than low taxes.</p>
        <p>''Normally you would think a businessman would cut expenses more than taxes,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who helped lead the city through the 1970's. ''But he came to his own conclusion as to what is more bearable to a city, especially in terms of safety, education and cleanliness, and believes that tax increases, although difficult, are bearable. I believe he is perfectly honest in believing that these are the priorities, and he will set them as he sees most appropriate and bear the consequences.''</p>
        <p>Many business executives appear to agree. ''I know what he is saying is true, because I was here in the 70's when every day every other car was broken into,'' Mr. Ratner said. ''There is nothing worse.''</p>
        <p>It seems likely that Mr. Bloomberg will be able to maintain the support of his many private sector pals -- many of whom he has shared years of friendship or business relationships -- for now. But if a property tax increase begets a personal income tax increase -- especially to plug a hole left by an unfulfilled commuter tax wish -- that support is likely to dissipate.</p>
        <p>''There's a general feeling that he did what was necessary,'' Ms. Wylde of the Partnership said about her members. ''At this point they are taking him at his word that he is going to keep the city competitive from a service and tax standpoint. Some are a little horrified when he is making the comment that no one leaves over high taxes. They know that he knows there is a threshold.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 8, 2002, Sunday  An article last Sunday about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's budget philosophy referred imprecisely to spending reductions adopted last month. They included cuts to city services, for recurring savings. They were not mostly one-time cuts to spending on items like heat, light and power.</p>
