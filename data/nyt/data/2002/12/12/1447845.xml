      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I.D., a design magazine whose influence far outweighs its subscription base of 31,000, has a new editor, Julie Lasky. Ms. Lasky, 42, the last editor of the now defunct Interiors magazine, plans to revive the New York operations of I.D., which was moved to Cincinnati in 1999, shortly after being acquired by F&amp;W Publications. Steven C. Pippin, the magazine's publisher, said that I.D. still has a loyal following but ''we've not expanded the brand as much as we would like.'' The magazine, which won four National Magazine Awards in the last decade, has been without a well-known editor since 2000. ''What I need to do is beef up circulation,'' Ms. Lasky said. The June 2003 issue will be the first to reflect her leadership. ''I'm thinking of nanotechnology, surveillance tools and, of course, Italian furniture,'' she said. ''If Isaac Mizrahi were to take over Popular Mechanics -- that is the kind of magazine I want.''</p>
