        <p>A team of I.B.M. researchers plans to report on what would be the world's smallest transistor when they deliver a research paper this week at the annual International Electronic Device Meeting opening here on Monday.</p>
        <p>The researchers said the advance would help ensure that the semiconductor industry could fulfill its performance projections through at least 2016.</p>
        <p>The transistor, which was designed by a team of I.B.M. researchers led by Meikei Ieong, is just nine nanometers in length -- or at least one-tenth the size of the most advanced transistors currently in production. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter; the average human hair is more than 3,000 times as wide as a nanometer.</p>
        <p>The tiny transistors would allow for high-capacity memory and faster digital logic abilities. But they also create challenges because as transistors are packed ever more densely on the surface of silicon wafers, heat becomes more of a problem.</p>
        <p>Each year a consortium of international semiconductor groups releases an International Technology Roadmap charting the progress the industry has made toward scaling down the basic components of microelectronic devices. The 2001 road map indicated that to continue at the present rate, the transistor would need to be smaller than nine nanometers by 2016.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ieong said the ability to make such ultrasmall transistors was essential for studying the odd physical world at the subatomic level that the semiconductor industry was now approaching. There is no firm evidence that chips can be made infinitely smaller because of instabilities, like the leakage of electrons across boundaries within the device that are supposed to serve as insulators.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 10, 2002, Tuesday  A article in Business Day yesterday about plans by I.B.M. to announce the world's smallest transistor misstated the size. It is six nanometers -- or six-billionths of a meter -- not nine nanometers.</p>
