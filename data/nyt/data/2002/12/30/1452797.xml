        <p>They sound more like New Year's resolutions: drink less, smoke less. But this coming year, they will be enforced by the police, under separate measures that are signed into law today in New York City and the state.</p>
        <p>The day before a typically lethal night of drunken driving, Gov. George E. Pataki will sign a law decreasing the legal blood-alcohol limit by one-fifth, to 0.08.</p>
        <p>The law will go into effect March 1. New York will become the 32nd state to lower the limit to 0.08. The average 160-pound man would have to drink four drinks in one hour to meet that level; a 120-pound woman, three drinks.</p>
        <p>''It's a good thing; it's going to save some lives,'' said Beth Oakes, director of the Chautauqua County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. ''We've been advocating for 0.08 for several years.''</p>
        <p>The current limit, 0.10 percent, was set in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>The new limit came after much wrangling in Albany. In 1998, Congress passed legislation that called for the states to lower the legal limit for alcohol or face the loss of federal financing for highways. But legislative leaders in New York attached stiffer penalties for drunken driving to its bill, prompting opposition that delayed its passage. With a loss in financing looming next year, the impasse broke earlier this month, when the Republican majority leader, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, severed the two proposals on penalties.</p>
        <p>The political infighting frustrated drunken-driving reformers like Joyce Reynolds, president of the MADD chapter in Allegany County.</p>
        <p>''It seems a shame the incentive had to come from funding for the highways or whatever,'' she said. ''That always seems to be the way it is. You'd think because it's the right thing to do, or we need to save lives, we need to pass something.''</p>
        <p>Some representatives of MADD chapters across the state will attend the signing today at noon in Manhattan. A man whose son who was killed by a driver who tested at 0.08 percent is scheduled to speak. The person behind the wheel was within the legal limit.</p>
        <p>''It's the way it was looked at prior to now,'' said Elizabeth Obad, the state chairwoman of MADD. ''It was pretty much looked at like the person wasn't that intoxicated, and nothing happened to the offender. A 0.08 driver is seriously impaired.''</p>
        <p>The state police have estimated that the decrease in the limit could save 40 lives a year.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will sign his antismoking measure into law today. That, too, takes effect in March, banning smoking in any establishment that hires employees, or almost all city bars.</p>
