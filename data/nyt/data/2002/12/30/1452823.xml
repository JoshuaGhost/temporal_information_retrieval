        <p>When the major record labels complained of copyright infringement during the rise of Napster and its most popular successor, KaZaA, critics of the music industry were fond of noting that there was no legitimate alternative for people who wanted to get music online.</p>
        <p>Now that has changed. Last month, a flurry of licensing deals finally allowed online music companies to offer songs from all of the major record labels, setting the stage for them to market aggressively the notion of consuming music through the Internet -- without stealing it -- next year.</p>
        <p>The digital music market will still be tiny, analysts say, but 2003 will be a crucial year for services like Pressplay, MusicNet and Rhapsody to raise their profiles with consumers and distinguish themselves from one another.</p>
        <p>Jupiter Research expects consumers to pay about $79 million for downloaded songs and CD's in 2003. Subscription services, which offer access to a wide range of music for a monthly fee, are expected to collect about $107 million next year.</p>
        <p>For $10 or more a month, such services let consumers hear music on demand and download songs. Analysts expect early adopters to begin using them as people discover that they can eliminate the hunting and the bother of free services to get a wide selection of music with guaranteed quality.</p>
        <p>The brewing battles among these services will be over how they package songs, what kind of exclusive access they can offer subscribers to particular artists and whether they can be used for portable devices, stereos and cars.</p>
        <p>The services will also vie for partnerships with Internet providers, cable TV companies, retailers and other distributors. ''We're going to begin to see the ABC, NBC and CBS of online music services,'' said Lee Black, a senior analyst at Jupiter. ''Some will have programming others do not.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, record labels are expected to install security technology on CD's to try to stem the use of CD burners to make unauthorized copies. Along with the stick, many labels are experimenting with different carrots to persuade consumers to buy, including extra tracks on CD's, better access to tickets for paying fans and the promise of online chats with favorite artists.</p>
        <p>Will any of that stop the growth of Internet file-trading? ComScore Media Metrix, an Internet measurement firm, estimated that there were about nine million users of KaZaA in the third quarter of this year, more than double the number Napster, now defunct, had at its peak.</p>
        <p>''We do see more people saying they are willing to pay for things on the Internet,'' said Peter Daboll, president of comScore Media Metrix. ''And there is hope for the paid music services. But when people see all the music out there for free, it's hard to resist.''</p>
