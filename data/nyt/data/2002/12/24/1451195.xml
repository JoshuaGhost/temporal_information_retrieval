        <p>Thomas Hine's 1986 book ''Populuxe'' was a sprightly romp through the 1950's and early 60's, the era that gave us dinette sets, Tupperware parties, cars with big fins and split-level homes with rumpus rooms, picture windows and Hollywood closets. The book was both an astute cultural history of that hopeful and spendthrift postwar period and a sleek time machine that transported us to the days when the American Dream came equipped with a push button, when kitchen appliances looked like something from Disney's Tomorrowland, and everything else in the house was covered in Naugahyde, wood-grain Formica or candy-colored contact paper.</p>

        <p>I WANT THAT!  How We All Became Shoppers  By Thomas Hine  Illustrated. 222 pages. HarperCollins. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Thomas Hine's 1986 book ''Populuxe'' was a sprightly romp through the 1950's and early 60's, the era that gave us dinette sets, Tupperware parties, cars with big fins and split-level homes with rumpus rooms, picture windows and Hollywood closets. The book was both an astute cultural history of that hopeful and spendthrift postwar period and a sleek time machine that transported us to the days when the American Dream came equipped with a push button, when kitchen appliances looked like something from Disney's Tomorrowland, and everything else in the house was covered in Naugahyde, wood-grain Formica or candy-colored contact paper.</p>
        <p>What distinguished ''Populuxe'' was the ability of Mr. Hine -- then an architecture and design critic -- to articulate the hidden connections he saw among the effluvia of popular culture and to draw from them some original conclusions about postwar American society. The book was witty, provocative and informative, ranging from discussions of public and private architecture to meditations on suburbia, from deconstructions of popular design tropes (like the ubiquitous pre-Nike boomerang shape, signifying speed and motion and progress) to pithy assessments of advertising techniques.</p>
        <p>It's easy enough to see how Mr. Hine moved from the subject matter in ''Populuxe'' to the subject of shopping, tackled in his latest book, ''I Want That!'' After all, he described the Populuxe decade (1954-64) as ''one of history's great shopping sprees,'' a period when an ascendant middle class began spending unprecedented sums of money on a mind-boggling array of household goods and little luxuries meant to ratify their achievement of the good life.</p>
        <p>The problem is, ''I Want That!'' possesses none of the freshness or wit of ''Populuxe.'' Instead, it's a tired recycling of ideas and observations, harvested from a wide range of earlier books: from social histories, mercantile histories and histories of advertising, from classic works like Thorstein Veblen's ''Theory of the Leisure Class'' and not-so-well known books like Ann Satterthwaite's recent ''Going Shopping.'' Though there are a few asides in this volume about Mr. Hine's own shopping experiences, they are perfunctory in the extreme and do nothing to showcase his keen eye for social and design details.</p>
        <p>As for the writing, it's ponderous, fulsome and entirely devoid of humor and nuance. ''Sometimes, perhaps, we shop to relax, but just as often, we shop to succeed,'' Mr. Hine writes in one chapter. And a few pages later: ''They shop to be selfish and to be generous. They shop to belong, and they shop to prevail.'' He talks about ''two visions'' of the shopper ''as hero and as dupe.'' And he draws an analogy between the spoiled supermarket shoppers of today, who can choose among dozens of varieties of designer pasta and luxury ice cream, and the women of a Kalahari Desert tribe who scrounge an existence from that unforgiving landscape, arguing that they are united by ''the goal of seeing that the family is fed and the household is maintained.''</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Hine's argument that modern consumers shop to define their identities, to fit in with their peers, to climb the social ladder, to demonstrate their freedom of choice. These are the sorts of observations that any number of articles in any number of women's magazines make all the time, but Mr. Hine delivers them with an air of turgid self-importance. He describes shopping as ''an exercise of both profound responsibility and profound freedom'' and the ''buyosphere'' (that is, the world in which we shop) as ''our chief arena for expression, the place where we learn most about who we are, both as a people and as individuals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hine reminds us that shopping is a relatively recent phenomenon -- depending on whom you believe, it has been around only for 200 to 500 years -- and much of this volume is devoted to chronicling its brief history. He outlines the proliferation of things (like clocks, mirrors and fashions) that began in the 17th century and points out the efforts of the ruling class in some countries to preserve the social order by enacting sumptuary laws regulating what members of particular classes could own or wear. The familiar consequences of the Industrial Revolution are also duly noted, in particular its opening the way to large-scale consumption.</p>
        <p>The rest of the book traces the evolution of shopping and the transformation of stores from small, speciality shops to lavish department stores to giant malls with theme-park-style attractions, from service-oriented retailers (whose sales staff controlled access to merchandise, and prices were not marked on the goods) to self-service stores to mammoth discount houses.</p>
        <p>There are some amusing digressions about niche marketing and the expansion of the buyosphere into our homes (with radio, television, magazines and telemarketing), and some insipid digressions about Christmas shopping and women's passion for shopping. What these digressions share with the rest of the book is a sense of shopworn familiarity, all of which makes for a volume quite beneath the skills of the insightful author of ''Populuxe.''</p>
