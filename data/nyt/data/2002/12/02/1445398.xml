        <p>Despite being part of the social and political establishment, Betsy Gotbaum has had a hard time getting her footing since taking office as public advocate.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>She has been a trusted adviser to three mayors. Well-regarded when she served under David N. Dinkins as commissioner of parks, she went on to revive the withering New-York Historical Society. A member of the city's social and political establishment, she counts Brooke Astor, Susan Thomases and Theodore W. Kheel among her supporters.</p>
        <p>Somehow, though, since taking office as public advocate in January, Betsy Gotbaum has had a hard time getting her footing. Marginalized, she is now so far out of the loop that, to her critics, she has become a joke at City Hall.</p>
        <p>And no one knows that better than Ms. Gotbaum herself.</p>
        <p>''I haven't had a winner yet,'' Ms. Gotbaum said in a recent interview. ''I've got to get this message out more about why this office is important and why it's good for New Yorkers. It's not clear that people understand what the office is.''</p>
        <p>Nor is there agreement on how Ms. Gotbaum should fill it.</p>
        <p>Even on a recent trip to Israel with about a dozen other officials and political associates, including William C. Thompson Jr., the city comptroller, and Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, Ms. Gotbaum could not escape the din of criticism. More than half of the group present, she said, hectored her about how she should attack Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a way of asserting her relevance.</p>
        <p>''You've got to throw bombs at the mayor,'' she said they told her. ''Every day you ought to be on the steps of City Hall, or every Sunday, criticizing what he has said.''</p>
        <p>''But that's not what I ran on,'' Ms. Gotbaum said. ''And that's not my style."</p>
        <p>Detractors say her reticence has left Ms. Gotbaum, 64, on the sidelines at City Hall. Another strike against her is that her office lacks a formal role in the biggest drama playing out there -- the worst budget crisis since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>She has made mistakes, she acknowledges. She should have stepped out more, and earlier, latching on to an important issue that she could make her own.</p>
        <p>''But you know there are slow starters,'' she said. ''I've never been elected to anything before.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gotbaum, however, thinks she is close to demonstrating how her job can work, with a project that could show people just how crucial the public advocate can be.</p>
        <p>Even so, she is aware that time may be running out. A charter proposal backed by Mayor Bloomberg and passed on Nov. 5 has already stripped the public advocate of one role, serving as presiding officer of the City Council. Ms. Gotbaum's budget, which was shaved in June, has come down even further in the most recent modification.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bloomberg, a longstanding friend and supporter, has shown little interest in working with her, despite her stated desire to be a partner to the other branches of government.</p>
        <p>''Politically and practically she knows that she has to deliver right now in order to assert her own relevance and the relevance of her office,'' a colleague said.</p>
        <p>Some people suggest that Ms. Gotbaum's difficulties may be more about the office than they are about her.</p>
        <p>''Betsy is somewhat a victim of the position she attained,'' said Donald J. Trump, who contributed to her campaign, as did Mr. Bloomberg. ''A lot of the power has been clipped away. It's less and less relevant as it keeps getting diminished.''</p>
        <p>The question of whether the office should even exist has dogged it since its inception. ''The commission that created this position, there were very serious questions raised as to whether or not you need it,'' said Joseph P. Viteritti, a public policy professor at New York University. ''And over time people keep questioning what the role is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Viteritti himself does not see much use in the office. ''Anyone who's elected by the public can claim to be a public advocate,'' he said. ''And in New York, there are all kinds of avenues for advocacy. It's not really a reflection of her personally. She's a person out there with a voice, but there are a lot of voices out there.''</p>
        <p>The public advocate post grew out of the office of City Council president, which wielded tremendous power over important decisions as a voting member of the Board of Estimate.</p>
        <p>When the board was eliminated in 1989 and many of its functions were turned over to the Council, there was a push to get rid of the office of Council president. Andrew J. Stein, then the president, lobbied to retain the job, and the Charter Commission ultimately agreed to keep it, but in an attenuated form.</p>
        <p>The commission decided that the comptroller should focus on fiscal matters, which led to the notion that the position of Council president, renamed public advocate in 1993, would focus on service issues, providing both a countervailing voice against a strong mayor and another opportunity for women and minorities to seek citywide office.</p>
        <p>Since the days of Mr. Stein the office has been further diminished. The public advocate's major duties now include serving as the city's ombudsman and as an ex officio member of the City Council. But instead of commanding a staff of 65 in a complex of offices in City Hall, Ms. Gotbaum has a staff of 29 in the Municipal Building across the street, down from the 45 or so employed by her predecessor, Mark Green.</p>
        <p>All of which has left Ms. Gotbaum, a conciliator who likes to work behind the scenes, with something of a problem. Several consultants and current and former officials, all of whom were loath to criticize her publicly, said that since the office exists to hammer away at the administration, the best way for Ms. Gotbaum to define herself and gain attention would be for her to come out swinging at Mr. Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>''It's a bully pulpit,'' said one council member, ''and it will be judged by the one in the pulpit.''</p>
        <p>It is a stance Ms. Gotbaum has studiously avoided, even as her relationship with Mr. Bloomberg has chilled. The mayor, who gave her a large campaign contribution early on, has been angered by several of her actions. First, she declined a request to endorse him or stay neutral in the general election, both of which were politically impossibile, her supporters say. Then came her appearance at a hip-hop rally supporting pay increases for teachers.</p>
        <p>''People still want me to throw bombs at the mayor,'' she said. ''I am not a bomb-thrower. I'm just not. I can fight and I can argue, but it's just not in my nature.''</p>
        <p>But the efforts she has made to raise her profile have not helped her case much, critics say.</p>
        <p>''Instead of commenting three sentences on 40 issues, she needs 3,000 words on two issues,'' said one former city official. ''You can't make a difference without getting some attention, and you have to take on something serious and have the research to back it up. You have to be able to trot out something that has legs, and be able to say why it makes a difference to 2.5 million of the 8 million New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gotbaum, who said she is at her best when she is ''down 5-2 in a tennis match,'' thinks she has just such a plan. She is about to push an initiative to ensure that qualified individuals are able to get food stamps. According to a report released by her office, as many as 800,000 needy individuals are being left out of the program.</p>
        <p>Convinced that a streamlined application process and intensified outreach would help solve a problem that is likely to become worse as the fiscal crisis develops, Ms. Gotbaum has been working with the United Way and the Human Resources Administration to develop a program and has lined up a private donor to help pay for it. (Ms. Gotbaum's own fund-raising skills are legendary. ''Being in Betsy's debt is a lot like borrowing money from a loan shark,'' joked a friend and contributor, John Stewart, in introducing her at a recent Princeton Club luncheon. ''You pay and pay and pay, and the debt never gets smaller.'')</p>
        <p>''I'm willing to give everybody credit,'' Ms. Gotbaum said of the food stamp initiative. ''I need something like this to happen so I can say: 'See what we did? We've signed up 500,000 more people for food stamps.' It would be a win-win for everybody.''</p>
        <p>She remains relatively sanguine about the fight she faces. After New Yorkers voted in November to remove her as presiding officer of the City Council, Speaker Gifford Miller announced that he would designate Ms. Gotbaum to run meetings, thus undoing in practice that charter revision backed by the mayor.</p>
        <p>That day, Ms. Gotbaum ran into Mr. Miller's father, Leigh, who had come to see her speak at the Princeton Club. His wife, Lynden, a prominent designer of public gardens, is the godmother of Ms. Gotbaum's daughter.</p>
        <p>''Your son is going to have a fun announcement today,'' Ms. Gotbaum said gleefully. ''He has a good sense of humor, the lad.''</p>
        <p>Others support her too.</p>
        <p>''She brings some order and focus, she's worked at a senior level in several administrations, and she brings an understanding of city government, which is very helpful especially with so many newcomers,'' said Bill de Blasio, a Brooklyn councilman and the chairman of the General Welfare Committee.</p>
        <p>Felix G. Rohatyn, who described Ms. Gotbaum and her husband, Victor, the former labor leader, as ''very, very dear and very, very old friends,'' said that she was always full of good ideas.</p>
        <p>''I think she is a remarkably energetic and committed New Yorker and can do a number of very positive things,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''I think she can do a lot to help the mayor because they would both like to help the city, and it would help all of us.''</p>
        <p>As for the role of the office, ''I don't see anything wrong with public advocacy,'' he said. ''Why not?''</p>
