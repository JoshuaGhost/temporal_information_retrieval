        <p>LEAD: When the Spring National Championships of the American Contract Bridge League began here this afternoon, two events had already been concluded.</p>
        <p>When the Spring National Championships of the American Contract Bridge League began here this afternoon, two events had already been concluded.</p>
        <p>The two divisions of the North American Pair Championship, known in past years as the Grand National Pairs, ended Thursday night after eight months of preliminary effort at club and district levels.</p>
        <p>Winners of the open title were two Colorado experts, Jan Janitschke of Denver and Dick Reed of Boulder. The standings were: first, Janitschke and Reed, 481.9 match points; second, Ronald Sukoneck and Judi Cody of Annandale, Va., 478.3; third, Steve Sellers and Shirley Blum of Fresno, Calif., 475.2. A Crucial Opening Lead</p>
        <p>The standings in Flight B, restricted to players below life master rank, were: first, William Thomas and David Deaderick of Austin, Tex., 415.5, technically tied with Bernard Pollack of Roslyn Estates L.I., and Leo Austern of Lake Success, L.I., 415.1; third, Paula Justl and Steve Samuels of Columbus Ohio, 407.7.</p>
        <p>One of the open winners had to make a crucial opening lead on the diagramed deal. After three passes, South gambled with three no-trump. The gamble would have succeeded if West had led a heart or a small card in either minor suit.</p>
        <p>But Janitschke as West reasoned well and chose the club ace. He was sure that South held a long, solid diamond suit to justify his opening, and clubs was likely to be the weakness: If East had held a respectable major suit, he would probably have bid in third seat.</p>
        <p>The result was down four, for the defense took the first eight tricks in the black suits.</p>
        <p>If North played four hearts, as happened at some tables, he had no chance after the lead of a singleton diamond since he lacked a quick entry to his hand.</p>
        <p>The defense could also prevail after a club lead, for West could win and shift to the spade king. Further spade leads then promoted a trump trick for the defense.</p>
