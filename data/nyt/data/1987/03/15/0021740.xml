        <p>LEAD: Stevenson of the Bronx beat Lincoln of Brooklyn, 65-61, in overtime yesterday to advance to the Public Schools Athletic League championship game against Springfield Gardens of Queens.</p>
        <p>Stevenson of the Bronx beat Lincoln of Brooklyn, 65-61, in overtime yesterday to advance to the Public Schools Athletic League championship game against Springfield Gardens of Queens.</p>
        <p>Springfield Gardens defeated Far Rockaway, 76-66, in the opening game of a semifinal doubleheader in Alumni Hall at St. John's. The championship game will be played at 3 P.M. next Saturday, also at Alumni Hall.</p>
        <p>Stevenson (25-1) led comfortably until Lincoln drew to 54-51 with 1 minute 4 seconds to play in regulation. Darryl Williams then hit a 20-footer to bring the Railsplitters to 54-53.</p>
        <p>After a timeout, Stevenson went into a delay offense. Chris Tate, the Stevenson point guard, was fouled with 20 seconds left and made one of two free throws to put Stevenson up by 55-53. But Williams hit another 20-footer to tie the score.</p>
        <p>The Ambassadors pulled away in the 3-minute overtime period, paced by Singleton, who led them in scoring with 26 points.</p>
