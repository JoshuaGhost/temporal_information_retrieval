        <p>MY HOME IS Jutland, and when a stranger notes my unusual accent and asks me what part of Denmark I come from, I have a stock answer. I am a West Jute, I say - from a little farther west than most. That, of course, requires elaboration. I am English, I explain, but from the ancient Danelaw, the northern half of England that was settled by the Danes about 850, where the Danish language and Danish laws held sway for over 200 years, and still, to this day, are more in evidence than its inhabitants know. I am a returned emigrant, I say, come back after a thousand years.</p>
        <p>Denmark has changed somewhat since my forebears sailed from Vestervig, where the Lim Fjord runs out into the North Sea. But Jutland has changed less than the rest of the land. Jutland is the peninsula that (as its name implies) juts northward from the European continent toward Norway. It comprises the Danish mainland as well as German Schleswig and, with its broad back, protects the lush Danish islands from the harsh storms of the Atlantic and the North Sea. It is a ridge of clay and gravel and boulders, pushed up by the advancing edge of the icecap of the last ice age and left standing when the glaciers went back 10,000 years ago - to fetch more rocks, as they say. But 10,000 years is a longish time, and since then the land has been greened, smoothed over with grass and heather and later with the beeches that are Denmark's national tree, and later still brought under the most intensive agriculture in Europe.</p>
        <p>Jutland has ever turned its back on the seas to the west. It is in the eastern half of the peninsula, where fjord beyond fjord runs deep into the land, that the rich farmlands and the beech woods lie thickest, and the greater part of the population dwells. So it was, too, a thousand years ago, and if you would seek the relics of the Vikings, you will find them most numerous in the eastern half of Jutland. It was there the Vikings lived, on their farms and in their incipient market towns, and it was from these fjords (viks, they called them, and a Viking was a fjordsman) that their ships sailed out when population pressure counseled emigration. Central Jutland, with its heather-covered sand, and West Jutland, with its wind-swept miles of sparse grass, offered no inducements to settlers and have only within the last hundred years, with drainage and lavish use of fertilizers, been opened up.</p>
        <p>East Jutland should be taken from north to south, and should be taken in spring, coming down to meet the summer. But spring is late in these northern latitudes. May 8 is traditionally the date when the beech trees ''spring out,'' the date when the Danes awaken from their five-month winter hibernation. There have, it is true, been earlier signs of spring; for a fortnight or more the woods have been sheeted with a solid carpet of white anemones, and hardy souls, well muffled, venture out to glory in them. But when the sun shines through the canopy of new beech leaves, and the very air in the woods shimmers in green and gold, then all Denmark is abroad. Color comes back to dresses and blouses and jumpers, kerchiefs are whipped from shining hair, and everyone is suddenly young and beautiful.</p>
        <p>For the visitor, it is admittedly not easy to begin a Viking exploration in the northeast of Jutland. But if you come in, as many do, from the southwest, at Esbjerg, where the ships from England dock, do not be tempted into taking the main road eastward, the road toward Copenhagen. Head due north instead, and take the west coast as a contrast to things to come. It will not be without its rewards.</p>
        <p>But first one should see Ribe, 20 miles from Esbjerg. Ribe is the oldest town in Denmark, founded even before the first Viking raids on England in the year 789. But you will find no Vikings in Ribe (except in the museum); what survives is medieval - even the great cathedral is 400 years younger than the city. But the watchmen still sing the hours of the night as they pace the streets with their lanterns, and on the rooftops the storks, which arrived in early April, are repairing their nests.</p>
        <p>It is 100 miles from Ribe to Vestervig, due north and parallel with the coast, and there is no need to dally on the way. The point of this part of the journey is to get the broad sweep of western Jutland, to appreciate the wide flat landscape, with its sparse trees ever bent away from the prevailing western wind, and the wide expanse of the sky, with the light to the left that tells of the sea not far away. By all means turn off once - anywhere - on any of the roads leading westward to the coast. You may wander awhile on the deserted beach - it will be filled with German tourists during summer months - and look for the amber washed up by the winter storms from the sunken pine forests beneath the North Sea. As the great waves roll in on the one hand and the great sand dunes rise desolate on the other, you will realize that this whole coast is wide open to windward, that no Viking fleet could ever put out from here.</p>
        <p>It is from Vestervig that the Vikings sailed for the west; the name says as much. Three-quarters of the way up the Jutland peninsula, the Lim Fjord cuts clean across the country, providing a protected sailing route from the Kattegat to the North Sea. At either end the entrances are narrow, but in the middle the Lim Fjord widens out into an immense lake, containing county-sized islands, which gives ample room for the fleets that conquered England for Sweyn Forkbeard and Canute the Great to assemble, maneuver and wait in sheltered waters until the wind was fair for England.</p>
        <p>Vestervig lies where the natural harbor of the Lim Fjord runs out into the North Sea, and it is nothing but a name and a cathedral-sized church for a city that never was. Here should have lain a sister city to Bergen on the west coast of Norway, another city built to serve the commerce between Scandinavia and its colonies to the west. The Norwegian Vikings had established themselves in Scotland and Ireland, and Bergen accordingly grew to be the second city in Norway. But the Danish colonies, the Danelaw, lay in England, and William the Conqueror severed the link between them and their mother country. Vestervig never got itself built.</p>
        <p>But as you run east along the northern bank of the Lim Fjord, you will come, in the center of the country where the Lim Fjord narrows, to the base camp of the invading fleet. It is called Aggersborg. There is little to see, save the fading traces of a precisely circular rampart surrounding an immense area of meadow. But excavation has shown, within the rampart, the remains of 48 log-built longhouses, laid out with mathematical precision in 12 squares of four houses each. Each of the houses is over 90 feet long, with outcurving sides that unmistakably call to mind a ship. Each is big enough to accommodate the 60 or 70 men who would form the complement of a largish Viking warship.</p>
        <p>Aggersborg is only one of four such circular Viking camps known in Denmark, each with its longhouses arranged in squares. But it is by far the largest of the four. In fact, and perhaps signifi-cantly, it is precisely as large as the other three put together.</p>
        <p>Farther along the northern shore of the Lim Fjord, you will come to Norre Sundby and Aalborg, twin towns on either side of the now narrow fjord. And here at last you are in East Jutland, where the Vikings lived, and died. On the slopes above Norre Sundby, on the Lindholm Heights, lies a huge cemetery, drowned in drift sand for a thousand years and dug free less than 20 years ago. The whole hillside is covered with Viking graves, neatly framed with large standing stones, in circles and squares and triangles, and everywhere in the boat shape that the Vikings preferred for their journey to Valhalla. Here at last are the Vikings themselves. They are admittedly dead - one could hardly expect anything else. Yet somehow the apparent confusion of stones, unregimented, but each design neatly avoiding encroachment upon its neighbors, seems to typify the rugged, individualistic society of the sagas, in which self-respect and respect for the integrity of others were fundamental.</p>
        <p>And now the journey goes southward, to meet the summer, through the green hills and woodlands of my own, adopted, East Jutland. Now there is no hurry. You should dawdle through East Jutland, taking byroads past the moated brick manors and the four-square, half-timbered farms, which now, in the spring, have just received their annual color wash of white or ocher or pink. For the Danish farmers love to brighten their homes with paint and limewash. You should run down to the wooded fjords where, as one of the Danish anthems sings, ''the beeches mirror their crowns in the blue of the sea.'' Here you will meet the modern Vikings, for even this early in the year the fjords will be dotted with sails. Every other Dane has access to a boat of some sort or other, and takes it out at every opportunity from the beginning of May onward.</p>
        <p>But trend gradually southward. At Hobro you should turn aside to see the Viking camp at Fyrkat. It is one of the three camps that fed Aggersborg, and this one has been recently excavated, its circular rampart restored and the geometric plan of the interior marked out with cement filling the post holes where the timbers of the houses stood. And a little distance outside the camp, one of the great wooden houses has been reconstructed, its whale-backed roof covered with 25,000 oak shingles. Inside, the great hall, with broad benches along the walls and the long-fire down the center, seems cavernous and empty. But stand awhile, and populate it with a ship's crew under training. Hang weapons on the walls, lay out the furs and bedrolls on the benches, listen for the murmur of voices from the groups of young men throwing dice or gathered around the chessboards. The Vikings are not far away at Fyrkat.</p>
        <p>But Aarhus, farther to the south, is more intimately Viking. Admittedly it is a modern city, and admittedly it is where I live, and you can roam its shopping streets or its university park or even its folk museum, the Old Town, and never meet the Vikings. But Aarhus, like Ribe, was founded in Viking times, and Viking Aarhus is still there and accessible. Not far from the cathedral, beneath a modern bank, you can go down a flight of 20 steps and go back 50 years for each step you take. At the bottom you are in Viking Aarhus. For when the foundations for the bank were dug, the excavators found, 12 feet below street level, the ramparts of the earliest town, and within them the planked and cobbled streets and several of the timber houses that lay within the town wall. These were preserved where they (Continued on Page 102) 101 stood, and the plans for the bank were altered, so that Viking Aarhus could continue to lie where it originally lay. It is worth a visit.</p>
        <p>Southward again through the green woods that surround Aarhus, past my own museum of Moesgaard, where we can show you Viking relics and reconstructed Viking houses (and if you can stay until the last weekend in July, an authentic early medieval Viking market and regatta). Then onward to the one memorial of Viking Denmark that no visitor must miss. At Jelling lie the burial mounds of the first historical king and queen of Denmark, and the rune stone that has been called Denmark's baptismal certificate. The mighty grave mounds are reputedly those of King Gorm and Queen Thyra, and the smaller of two rune stones is Gorm's tribute to his dead consort. The larger stone, carved with lions and serpents and the crucified Christ, was raised by Gorm's son, King Harald Bluetooth, in memory of his father. And Harald records in the runes that he himself united Denmark, and conquered Norway, and ''made the Danes Christian.'' He does not record, though it seems to be the case, that he removed the remains of his parents from their heathen grave mounds and reinterred them in the church that he built between the mounds, where they were found and identified just a few years ago.</p>
        <p>King Harald Bluetooth was the father of King Sweyn, who conquered the whole of England, and grandfather of King Canute, who ruled both countries. And it appears to have been King Harald who built the camps at Aggersborg and Fyrkat. So Harald, too, probably had plans involving England.</p>
        <p>But then every Dane of that time had plans involving England. The Danish colonies in north England had at that date already been in existence for a hundred years and were under constant threat from the Anglo-Saxons in the south. King Gorm had, in his youth, campaigned in England and there must in these years have been much passage across the North Sea.</p>
        <p>In both directions. I am certainly not the only exile to have returned. Just rather later than most.  AROUND JUTLAND</p>
