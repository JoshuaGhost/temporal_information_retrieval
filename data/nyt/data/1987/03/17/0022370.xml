        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Further to your report that new oil shortages in the United States seem unavoidable (front page, Feb. 17):</p>
        <p>The perturbations being experienced by our oil industry can only get worse as the balance of the world's oil reserves continues to shift toward the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC will always have a supply and production advantage, and thus always be in a position to undercut us in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>To solve the problem, we must recognize the value of oil, not just its price. First, we should be willing to pay a price high enough to maintain a healthy domestic oil-producing capability. Like other major industries in this country, oil companies operate in an economic context they cannot entirely control. It is in the country's best interests to maintain their economic viability, even if it costs us a little more in the short term.</p>
        <p>Second, we should reserve oil for premium uses for which we have no realistic substitute - like transportation - and reduce the need for oil imports by substituting other fuels everywhere they can do the job.</p>
        <p>Electricity made from domestic coal and uranium could replace oil in almost all industrial, commercial and residential applications besides transportation. Together, these applications account for more than 35 percent of our total petroleum use, or about as much oil as we imported last year. (In 1986, 63.4 percent of the petroleum we used went for transportation. Imports of crude oil and refined products reached 2.2 billion barrels, an average of just over 6 million barrels a day, or 35.2 percent of the total used for the year.) One for one substitutions cannot be made so neatly in the real world, of course. But these statistics show our potential for solving the problem by the smart use of resources we already have at hand. WILLIAM B. REED  Birmingham, Ala., Feb. 28, 1987</p>
