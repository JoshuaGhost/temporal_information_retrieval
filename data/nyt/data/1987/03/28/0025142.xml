        <p>LEAD: Members of Congress charged today that the Reagan Administration was harassing rural physicians by excluding them from the Medicare program because they provided care that was deemed substandard.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress charged today that the Reagan Administration was harassing rural physicians by excluding them from the Medicare program because they provided care that was deemed substandard.</p>
        <p>But the Administration defended the disqualification of certain doctors, saying it sought to protect elderly patients from ''gross and flagrant violations'' of health care standards.</p>
        <p>The impassioned debate came at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the work of medical peer review organizations, which assess the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals under Medicare. 'Humiliated, Harassed and Afraid'</p>
        <p>The Government spent more than $75 billion last year on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 31 million elderly and disabled people.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a Texas Democrat, said, ''Under the current system of peer reviews, many physicians feel humilated, harassed and afraid to treat patients.''</p>
        <p>''More serious,'' he said, ''the current insensitivity to rural realities threatens the availability of health care not only for Medicare beneficiaries but for entire rural communities.''</p>
        <p>Of the 35 doctors disqualified from Medicare reimbursement in the last two years, most practice in rural areas such as Perryton, Tex., Alamo, Ga., and Bloomer, Wis. Rural Doctors Complain</p>
        <p>Senator George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Subcommittee on Health, said he shared ''the concern of a number of senators about the performance of peer review organizations in rural areas.'' Rural doctors from Maine to Texas are complaining, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. William L. Roper, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs the Medicare program, said: ''We are not eager to impose sanctions. We prefer to educate physicians and change their behavior. But we do have a responsibility to protect the beneficiaries.''</p>
        <p>''We will take account of the unique circumstances in rural areas,'' Dr. Roper added. ''But Medicare beneficiaries in these areas are entitled to high-quality care.''</p>
        <p>Under the Medicare law, a doctor may be excluded from the program if a peer review organization finds that he or she has committed ''a gross and flagrant violation'' posing an imminent danger to the health, safety or well-being of a beneficiary.</p>
        <p>The peer review groups are composed of physicians and other health care professionals. They work under contracts with the Government. 'Minimum Standard' Urged</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas G. Dehn, president of the American Medical Peer Review Association, a coalition of local peer review groups, said the sanctions imposed on rural doctors should not have been a surprise.</p>
        <p>''Many of these physicians are overworked,'' he testified. ''They practice in isolation. Their practice patterns have evolved in ways that are somewhat deviant from physicians in the rest of the country.''</p>
        <p>However, he said, peer review groups believe there must be ''a minimum standard of care for all physicians, irrespective of geographic location.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dehn said the Government was spending $150 million a year for peer review of services provided under Medicare. This represents one-fifth of 1 percent of Medicare's $75 billion budget and is too little, he said.</p>
        <p>Senator Mitchell and other lawmakers expressed concern that the peer review process was being used improperly by the Administration to justify the denial of medical services needed by elderly people. The Government may withhold payment for services deemed to be medically unnecessary. Setting of Quotas Denied</p>
        <p>Dr. Roper insisted that the Government had not set quotas requiring peer review groups to deny payment in a specified number of cases. But he said: ''If they do not issue a certain number of denials, we expect an explanation of why the care they are overseeing is so much better than in the rest of the country.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that the numerical goals set by the Government were based on ''a purely arbitrary judgment.''</p>
