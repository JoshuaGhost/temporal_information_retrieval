        <p>LEAD: At the Greenmarkets ''It's been a very rough year so far,'' said Barry Benepe, director of the Greenmarkets, the farmers' markets sponsored by the New York City Council on the Environment.

        <p>LEAD: At the Greenmarkets ''It's been a very rough year so far,'' said Barry Benepe, director of the Greenmarkets, the farmers' markets sponsored by the New York City Council on the Environment. Mr. Benepe was referring to the opposition from community groups to a proposed Greenmarket and other problems.</p>
        <p>At the Greenmarkets ''It's been a very rough year so far,'' said Barry Benepe, director of the Greenmarkets, the farmers' markets sponsored by the New York City Council on the Environment. Mr. Benepe was referring to the opposition from community groups to a proposed Greenmarket and other problems.</p>
        <p>The most acrimonious confrontation has occurred over the past three months regarding the market proposed, with the support of Community Board 2, for Mercer Street between Bleecker and West Third Streets. Mr. Benepe described the location as ideal because it is a wide block with plenty of parking. A group of tenants, mainly from the Washington Square Village complex adjacent to the site, has fought the proposal, saying the market would bring vermin, garbage, noise and undesirable people to the community.</p>
        <p>A compromise, permitting the market to operate only on Wednesday mornings and only from late July to October, was finally reached. Alternate sites for a Saturday market in the Greenwich Village area are being examined.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, the Greenmarket in the schoolyard of Public School 183, First Avenue at 67th Street, will not reopen this year. According to Mr. Benepe, the school's parents' association prefers to have produce vendors as part of its profit-making flea market at the site.</p>
        <p>The Greenmarket site on 87th Street between First and Second Avenues has been sold to a developer, and this summer may be its last hurrah, Mr. Benepe said.</p>
        <p>Although that market may close, Mr. Benepe said two new markets, both in Harlem, may be added. Truffles From Oregon</p>
        <p>For the first time Oregon black truffles are available commercially. Steve Andruss of Wild Harvest Mushrooms in Brownsville, Ore., has been shipping them to a few companies selling fancy foods to restaurants.</p>
        <p>Some of the truffles weigh half a pound and are about as big as a man's fist. These truffles, dug up in the wild by human beings, not pigs or dogs, are comparable to the European summer truffles: coal black on the outside with a brownish, mottled interior, a fairly crisp texture and a rich, earthy flavor reminiscent of Italian white truffles but not as pungent. Most have been found around young fir trees, and Mr. Andruss has a lease arrangement with a fir-tree farmer with 35,000 acres of trees.</p>
        <p>His company has also dug Oregon white truffles for the past four years. From November to February, he sold 600 pounds. ''The black truffles, Picoa carthusiana, are about 10 times as rare as the white ones,'' he said, ''but the sites seem to be more concentrated.''</p>
        <p>In the East the truffles are sold for $120 a pound by Assouline &amp; Ting, wholesaler that opens its warehouse at 926 West Allegheny Avenue in Philadelphia to the public on Fridays from 1 to 4 P.M. Telephone 800-521-4491; in Pennsylvania, 800-521-7485, and in Philadelphia, 215-225-8600. Camembert and Ricotta</p>
        <p>Fairway Fruits and Vegetables, 2127 Broadway (74th Street), is now carrying a superb new camembert from Massachusetts. Craigston camembert, made in Wenham, is being sold suitably ripened, so the texture is supple and satiny. The flavor of this pale cheese is mellow, with a subtle hint of mushrooms in the aroma. The cheeses, made from pasturized milk, weigh about a half pound and are $4.98 each.</p>
        <p>Fairway also has introduced anthotyro, a ricotta made from sheep's milk and imported from Greece. The flavor is slightly sharper than Italian-style ricotta. The cheese is lower in fat, with 4 percent compared with about 8 percent for whole-milk ricotta. The price is $3.69 a pound. Nutrition Month</p>
        <p>March is National Nutrition Month, and the Greater New York Dietetic Association has produced several programs for consumers. A calendar listing all of the lectures, information booths, counseling sessions and food demonstrations can be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed business-size envelope to the association at P.O. Box 871, Lenox Hill Station, New York, N.Y. 10021.</p>
        <p>The association has also prepared four recorded messages for consumers, one each week during the month, which can be heard by dialing 212-549-1170. This week's message is about Chinese food; next week the subject will be ''Power Lunches for Powerful Health,'' to be followed by information about pasta and then menus for Easter and Passover. Vegetarian Meals</p>
        <p>You won't find a flier slipped under your door or a stack of menus in the lobby or vestibule, but if you are interested in home-delivered vegetarian meals, the Natural Gourmet Cookery School, 48 West 21st Street, can supply them. The school's kitchens, under the direction of Annemarie Colbin, prepare attractive, adroitly seasoned and hearty meals. Among the dishes on a recent menu were a savory Scotch oat and leek soup, kasha with bright carrots and flavorful triangles of marinated tofu, a refreshing cucumber salad and a tangy, puddinglike lemon pie.</p>
        <p>The school's service delivers only on Monday and Thursday evenings. Each order has enough food for two lunches and two dinners for one (or fewer meals for more people). Simple reheating instructions are included. The price is $48.71, including tax, plus $7 for delivery in Manhattan between Canal and 96th Streets. Delivery to other areas can be arranged, but the tariff is higher. To order, telephone 212-929-6917 Monday through Friday. Allow at least one day's notice. A Contest for Waiters</p>
        <p>Contests have been held for chefs and for sommeliers. Now waiters will have their turn. On Monday at a meeting of the Society for American Cuisine in Williamsburg, Va., Patrick O'Connell, the chef and a co-owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va., announced the national competition, an essay contest. Anyone - man or woman - employed as a waiter can submit a maximum of 750 words on the topic ''The Perfect Waiter.'' Essays should be submitted by June 15 to the society at 304 West Liberty Street, Suite 301, Louisville, Ky. 40202; 502-583-3783.</p>
        <p>''We want to demonstrate that waiters are literate people who care about the profession,'' Mr. O'Connell said.</p>
        <p>The grand prize is a two-week gastronomic tour of the United States. Three runners-up will receive weekends in New York, San Francisco and at the Inn at Little Washington.</p>
