        <p>ON THE LEFT BANK 1929-1933. By Wambly Bald. Edited by Benjamin Franklin 5th. (Ohio University, $19.95.) Wambly Bald lived in Paris at almost the right time. He arrived there in 1929, just at the end of that magic decade, and began writing articles on bohemian life for the European edition of The Chicago Tribune. His column, much of which is reproduced in ''On the Left Bank 1929-1933,'' was an irreverent who's who of the avant-garde. It poked fun at all who haunted the Latin Quarter or who took themselves too seriously. He described Ford Maddox Ford as a ''huge, bland bulk'' whose jaw ''woggled'' when he danced, and wrote that Aldous Huxley, then 38, looked ''like a person who had been concentrating for 75 years.'' Much of Mr. Bald's commentary was tongue in cheek; he was a master of the one-liner and the telling anecdote. His columns consisted of reconstructed conversations, barroom banter and gossip, amid his reports on gallery openings, dance performances and parties. Most wicked were his comments on visits with artists and writers. He reported that Gertrude Stein told him that all of literature would come down to ''the big four'': Poe, Whitman, James and herself. ''The Blood of a Poet,'' a new film by Jean Cocteau, was, Mr. Bald wrote, ''as false as a gold tooth and just as obvious.'' Occasionally he was sentimental, especially toward the end of his stint in Paris. By 1933, as more and more of the old guard left for America, he lamented that ''nothing will remain but a legend and half a dozen crowded saloons.'' And, it could be added, this stylish commentary by a witty raconteur.</p>
