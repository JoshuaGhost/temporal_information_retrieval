        <p>The Magician of Lublin HBO/Cannon Video. 106 minutes. $79.95. If, as it appears, the lighting in this 1979 movie was designed to obscure rather than illuminate, it succeeds entirely in the video cassette version.</p>
        <p>The adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel about a clash between the flesh and the spirit in turn-of-the-century Poland spotlights Yasha, a gifted but impious prestidigitator and escape artist who cannot escape from the four or five women in his life. (His affection extends to a monkey, a parrot and a snake.) As he works his way up from a Polish shtetl to Lublin and finally to his big chance at performing in the biggest theater in Warsaw, he falls victim to his own illusions. He comes to believe that God is a magician - ''How do you do it?'' he demands - or that he is God or an unreasonable facsimile. In particular, Yasha thinks he can fly - and maybe he can.</p>
        <p>The director, Menahem Golan, evidently expended so much attention to laying on ersatz atmosphere that he didn't have time to explain to the cast what the story was about. As the magician, Alan Arkin gives a performance that is more mystifying than any of his tricks.</p>
        <p>Video cassettes are generally available in VHS and Beta. Some titles are also available in the 8-millimeter format and on LaserVision video disks. Unless otherwise specified, prices cited are the manufacturer's suggested retail price for a VHS cassette; rental rates vary from store to store.</p>
