        <p>LEAD: FOUR years after Thomas J. D'Amore Jr. became leader of the Connecticut Republicans with the goal of shedding their minority status, the state party last week was back at the drawing board with a spirited debate about its future course and a heated contest for a new state chairman.</p>
        <p>FOUR years after Thomas J. D'Amore Jr. became leader of the Connecticut Republicans with the goal of shedding their minority status, the state party last week was back at the drawing board with a spirited debate about its future course and a heated contest for a new state chairman.</p>
        <p>Last Monday, nearly four months after the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the statewide elections, Mr. D'Amore submitted his resignation, opening the way for the party to try to rebuild once again under new leadership.</p>
        <p>On March 10, the day Mr. D'Amore's resignation takes effect, the 72 members of the Republican State Central Committee will meet to elect a new chairman from a field of at least 10 candidates.</p>
        <p>For the Republicans, who in past years have spent almost as much time fighting each other as fighting the Democrats, the contest will set the party's organization for 1988, a Presidential election year in which Connecticut will be electing a United States Senator, six United States Representatives and both houses of the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Municipal contests will dominate the election calendar this year, and traditionally these are decided by local candidates and local issues rather than by statewide politics.</p>
        <p>Saying the party ''has a bright future,'' Mr. D'Amore said he was stepping down before his term expires in June so that the contest for chairman does not become entangled in the selection of a new State Central Committee by party caucuses in May. Mr. D'Amore, a 46-year-old real estate and insurance broker in New Hartford, became chairman after managing the re-election campaign of United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1982. Mr. Weicker is the only Connecticut Republican to win statewide office since 1970.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weicker, who is up for re-election next year, has said that he would remain neutral in the contest for chairman.</p>
        <p>But some Republicans said that the timing of Mr. D'Amore's departure could enable Weicker supporters to elect a chairman who would at least be compatible with the Senator before a new party committee is chosen in May.</p>
        <p>Their reasoning is that the conservative wing of the party, which has opposed Mr. Weicker in the past, could regain control of the party committee in the May caucuses, further straining relations between Mr. Weicker and the party organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amore said the accomplishment of which he was proudest was the adoption last fall of a constitutional amendment to remove the optional party lever from the state voting machines and the recent victory in the United States Supreme Court that enables the Republicans to open some of their primary elections in 1988 to unaffiliated voters.</p>
        <p>He said his biggest disappointment was the loss last November of the gubernatorial election to Governor O'Neill, a Democrat, which also contributed to the loss of Republican control of both houses of the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Those losses set off a wave of criticism of Mr. D'Amore's leadership and calls from Republicans for a restructuring of the party.</p>
        <p>Among the leading Republican critics was United States Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, who was elected to a second term last November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland proposed strengthening the party apparatus with improved fund raising, better candidate recruitment and more aggressive computer and telephone bank operations to identify sympathetic voters.</p>
        <p>''Instead of building a proper foundation to nurture statewide candidates, we look for a superstar at the last moment to whch we can hitch our wagon,'' Mr. Rowland said.</p>
        <p>He proposed devoting the party's resources to campaigns for the General Assembly and municipal offices to broaden the party's base.</p>
        <p>He also criticized Mr. D'Amore for excessive interference with the workings of the legislature and he accused Mr. Weicker of undermining the Republican candidates for the Governor and the Senate last fall by praising the Democratic incumbents, Mr. O'Neill and Senator Christopher J. Dodd.</p>
        <p>As the jockeying for a new chairman began last week, some Republicans said the two early front-runners appeared to be State Representative Richard Foley Jr. of Oxford and E. Clayton (Skip) Gengras Jr., a West Hartford businessman.</p>
        <p>But several leading Republicans said that no candidate had enough commitments yet to win the post and that the picture could change several times before the committee meets on March 10.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foley backed former State Senator Richard C. Bozzuto for the gubernatorial nomination last year, but Mr. Bozzuto was defeated by former State Representative Julie D. Belaga. Mr. Gengras was Mrs. Belaga's unsuccessful running mate for lieutenant governor.</p>
        <p>Other candidates who are said to have support on the committee are Robert S. Poliner of Durham, a member of the committee, and Herschel A. Klein of Windsor, a former Republican candidate for Congress.</p>
        <p>Also in the race are Gary A. Franks, a Waterbury alderman who was the party's candidate for state comptroller last year; former State Representative Pauline Kezer of Plainville, who was the party's candidate for secretary of the state; State Senator Fred H. Lovegrove Jr. of Fairfield; Greg Batterson, the party's town chairman in Coventry; Mark Johnson, the Bolton town chairman, and Frank Porto of North Haven, a member of the party's finance committee.</p>
