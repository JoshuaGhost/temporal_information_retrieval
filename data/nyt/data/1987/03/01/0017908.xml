        <p>LEAD: THE proposed county hotel tax, a 3 percent levy on hotel and motel rooms that would provide $3.5 million a year for Westchester's homeless, came a step closer to resolution in Albany last week, but remained well short of final approval.</p>
        <p>THE proposed county hotel tax, a 3 percent levy on hotel and motel rooms that would provide $3.5 million a year for Westchester's homeless, came a step closer to resolution in Albany last week, but remained well short of final approval.</p>
        <p>A delegation from the County Board of Legislators found Westchester Democrats in Albany who had previously resisted the measure now apparently in favor of it, but the discussions over how the proposed revenues would be designated revealed a new political disagreement among the local legislators.</p>
        <p>Democrats on the County Board said that the state legislation, which would enable the county to pass a law collecting the money, should specifically designate the homeless as recipients of the room tax, while Republicans opposed such designation in the state bill.</p>
        <p>Sandra R. Galef, Democrat of Ossining and the Board's minority leader, said: ''I think the state should indicate where the money is going; who knows who will be here, on the Board, five years from now?'' She said that ''if everyone agrees on the homeless as recipients, why not put it in writing?''</p>
        <p>The Republican view is that such designation at the state level would represent a continuing obligation on how the money is to be spent, perhaps even after the time when the problem was no longer a major issue. That may not be soon, however, with $18 million spent on the homeless last year, $32 million budgeted for them this year and $90 million anticipated for next year.</p>
        <p>The disagreement over designation came after Board members had compromised on the controversial hotel-tax proposal nearly two weeks ago. To achieve unanimity in their approach to Albany - considered a prerequisite for state approval - Democrats who had long opposed the measure agreed to support it if the Republicans agreed that the money go to house the homeless.</p>
        <p>While pledges to that effect were made in the heated debate in the Board's eighth-floor chamber of the County Office Building, there was no reference to the homeless in the resolution asking for a hotel tax that was sent to Albany.</p>
        <p>''I now question whether they really want it,'' Mrs. Galef said of the Republicans. Administration officials had sought that no designation be made for the hotel-tax revenues and that the money should go into the general fund. Proponents of the hotel tax at one time had indicated that the revenues should help the tourist industry and, for a long period, some legislators had hoped that the funds could go into the transportation budget, in an effort to reduce projected curtailments in bus service.</p>
        <p>State Senator Mary B. Goodhue, Republican of Mount Kisco, said: ''Frankly, I wish they'd get their act together.''</p>
        <p>''We were told,'' she went on, ''that the county legislators had now agreed on a hotel tax because the proceeds would go to the homeless. The current rhubarb appears to involve whether or not that should be written into the enabling legislation.''</p>
        <p>''I don't care either way,'' she said, but noted that ''it's probably not a good thing because the county would want flexibility in case they found a need more pressing than the homeless in years to come.''</p>
        <p>Edward J. Brady, Republican of Thornwood and the Chairman of the Board of Legislators, agreed with that position. ''It isn't necessary to earmark the bill for the homeless,'' he said. ''Albany has approved about 10 such hotel taxes for New York communities; some they've earmarked and some they haven't.''</p>
        <p>He said that the homeless would be specified as a recipient of hotel-tax receipts in the local bill to be approved by the Westchester legislature. ''It would give us local control,'' he said. ''If in 10 years the homeless is no longer a problem, we don't want to have to go hat in hand in Albany to have it changed.''</p>
        <p>The Republican-controlled State Senate last year had approved a hotel-tax bill with no reference to the homeless, but it was held up in the Democratic-controlled Asssembly by Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh, and Ronald C. Tocci, Democrat of New Rochelle, largely because there was no agreement on how the money would be used.</p>
        <p>Referring to the current request for legislation, Mr. Brodsky said he had not taken a fixed position on whether the homeless should be designated as recipients in a state bill enabling the county to collect the hotel tax, ''but most of the recent hotel taxes we passed have been earmarked - in Albany for a convention center, for example, and in New York City for housing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''From the beginning,'' he said, ''I've been saying that the state, in considering local tax requests, asks three questions: why do you need it, what are you going to do with it and what's the rest of your tax package?'' Mr. Brodsky said, ''They have now made it clear what they need it for and what they're going to do with it -and they said they have no present plans for further taxes.''</p>
        <p>He said that Westchester had another problem: ''Explaining why a county with a $23 million surplus needs a tax increase, especially while the state is in the process of cutting taxes.''</p>
        <p>But ''we'll push for the measure,'' Mr. Brodsky said, ''once they send us the specific wording on a bill.'' He added that ''even Mary Goodhue'' on the Senate side, where a hotel-tax authorization had previously been approved, ''said they need an official request'' for this newest version.</p>
        <p>The proposed hotel tax has been opposed by hotel managers ''who claim they are getting competition from Connecticut,'' Senator Goodhue said. ''Of course, they're doing very good business and are not about to go bankrupt. I don't think this will be a serious problem,'' she said and added that she believed the hotels would pass the 3 percent room tax ''onto the people who rent the rooms.''</p>
        <p>''It's better than either the property tax or the sales tax,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Board of Legislators had originally proposed another way to help the homeless - that is, through a $1 million rent-subsidy program that would provide assistance to county residents facing eviction, thus saving the higher cost of subsidizing the same families, now homeless, in hotels and motels.</p>
        <p>But County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, in his State of the County address Feb. 2, said that pilot program would not work. It was probably illegal to use public money to assist only certain members of a ''class'' of people, he said, and it violated the county's long-standing position that fixing assistance levels was a state responsibility.</p>
        <p>He called, instead, for municipalities to build their own affordable housing, saying that if they did not do so the county would condemn property to build emergency housing. The legislators, in their trip to Albany, asked for support of a bill that would permit the county to grant five-year county tax abatements to developers building low- and middle-income housing in blighted areas.</p>
        <p>They also sought legislation that would permit the county to build water and sewer lines in new housing developments and in some existing developments without sewers.</p>
        <p>Housing and the homeless are expected to represent major aspects of the Democatic reply to Mr. O'Rourke's State of the County address tomorrow afternoon in the legislative chamber. In a departure from previous responses, all six Democrats will speak, with Mrs. Galef providing the overview and others focusing on housing, the homeless, the eonomy, budget reform and utilities.</p>
        <p>The proposed $1 million rent assistance fund remains a subject of some interest to Democrats on the Board, meanwhile. Paul J. Feiner, Democrat of Hastings-on-Hudson, said he had received a five-page letter from Gerald A. Norlander, executive director of Westchester Legal Services last week, outlining how the program might work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norlander, responding to Mr. Feiner's request for comment on the proposed plan, agreed that the idea of providing monthly stipends of perhaps $100 to fewer than 1,000 families facing eviction - one version of how it might work - was flawed.</p>
        <p>It may not stop evictions because it is nearly impossible to determine which families are most in need of assistance, he said, and it would be difficult to evaluate whether the program of grants was working. Furthermore, adding a monthly stipend to the income of a public-assistance recipient would create serious administrative problems, in part because they would require reduction of other grants.</p>
        <p>He also said there could be serious legal problems, in part because of a state requirement for ''uniformity'' in Federal programs. There is no provision in the state plan allowing a county to select a portion of the caseload and give it a higher monthly shelter stipend not available to all recipients who have equivalent rents.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Norlander said that did not mean the proposed program should be abandoned. He said that instead of offering monthly rent subsidies, the $1 million county assistance program could supplement Federal and state Emergency Assistance to Families programs, where aid can be used only once a year to prevent impending eviction.</p>
        <p>He said that an emergency-assistance approach would be consistent with the obligation and authority of the county to act to stop evictions.</p>
