        <p>LEAD: In its condemnation of scientific intervention in human reproduction, the Roman Catholic Church would restrict couples to medical procedures that are riskier and more difficult than the more common practices that the Church wants outlawed, medical and religious experts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In its condemnation of scientific intervention in human reproduction, the Roman Catholic Church would restrict couples to medical procedures that are riskier and more difficult than the more common practices that the Church wants outlawed, medical and religious experts said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Church authorities in the United States began debating among themselves yesterday how to apply the doctrinal statement that the Vatican issued Tuesday to a variety of techniques, some well-established and others still experimental, that are meant to help couples bear children. Some techniques that individual bishops had favored are now being reconsidered.</p>
        <p>Apart from the procedures for infertility, the Vatican's statement did not challenge some rare methods of treating unborn fetuses, including technologies that stand in the forefront of modern genetics research. The doctrinal pronouncement specifically approved of intervention to heal an embryo of ''maladies such as those stemming from chromosomal defects.''</p>
        <p>Such defects include the most damaging disorders, such as Down's syndrome. Although research into the manipulation of chromosomes has progressed rapidly in recent years, treatment of such defects by genetic technologies remains in the future. Therapeutic Procedures Allowed</p>
        <p>''I was very surprised that they would come openly now and say that if it were purely therapeutic, not eugenic, some genetic engineering could be allowed,'' said the Rev. Orville Griese of the Pope John XXIII Center, a biomedical institute in Braintree, Mass.</p>
        <p>However, the Vatican's instructions of the treatment of infertility - 40 pages of moral reasoning and scientific detail - appeared to weigh even against procedures that were not explicitly banned, such as the artificial insemination of a woman using her husband's sperm or the surgical transfer of an egg past a blockage in a Fallopian tube.</p>
        <p>To some authorities, the essence of many of the procedures is a separation of the process of reproduction from the act of sexual intercourse, and it is precisely that separation that the Vatican's statement opposed.</p>
        <p>''That's what the new artificial procreation methods are about,'' George J. Annas, professor of health law at Boston University, said yesterday. ''What the Church is saying is that they reject that separation, and if you do that you basically reject all the methods.'' Artificial Insemination Banned</p>
        <p>The statement banned artificial insemination using sperm from donors other than a woman's husband - a century-old practice that results in thousands of births each year in the United States. Also banned was in vitro fertilization, in which eggs and sperm are combined outside the body and fertilized embryos are reimplanted into the womb.</p>
        <p>These esoteric-seeming procedures have spread rapidly in recent years as treatment for a variety of different kinds of infertility. Low sperm count can be addressed by collecting, cleaning and concentrating semen and then using it in artificial insemination. Damaged Fallopian tubes, which ordinarily carry the egg to the womb, can be bypassed by in vitro fertilization.</p>
        <p>Before the release of the statement Tuesday, some Catholic officials had encouraged a much less common technique in which the eggs and sperm are injected together into a woman's Fallopian tube in the hope they will fertilize. Church officials in the United States disagreed yesterday on the status of this technique of gamete intrafallopian transfer.</p>
        <p>Father Griese of the Pope John XXIII Center said he expected the Vatican to issue a further special instruction on the technique. The statement did not directly proscribe it. ''If the technical means facilitates the conjugal act or helps it to reach its natural objectives, it can be morally acceptable,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>But the instructions did rule out obtaining sperm by masturbation, the standard method for all such procedures, including routine tests meant to find the cause of a couple's infertility. 'The Masturbation Hurdle'</p>
        <p>''It's unclear to me how you do them without masturbation, so there seems to be an inconsistency there,'' said John Robertson of the University of Texas Law School, a member of the ethics committee of the American Fertility Society. ''If you got over the masturbation hurdle, again it's unclear, because the other notion is that reproduction must be combined with sexual intercourse.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. John Connery of Loyola University in Chicago, who serves as a medical ethics consultant for Catholic hospitals, said there were acceptable alternatives.</p>
        <p>''If a couple, let's say, had intercourse, and the doctor then took a syringe and went into the vagina and got the sperm and then injected it farther into the uterus or the Fallopian tube -if that could be done, I think you could justify it,'' Father Connery said.</p>
        <p>Other Catholic medical authorities said sperm for such procedures could be obtained ethically by using a condom deliberately pierced with holes to allow some sperm to escape. A standard condom is unacceptable to the Church, since it is a means of contraception, even if the ultimate goal is to conceive a child.</p>
        <p>''It shows how precise is the Catholic teaching,'' said the Rev. Kevin O'Rourke of the Catholic Center for Health Care in St. Louis. ''The intentions are to be evaluated, and the ultimate intention is not the only intention to be considered. You have to consider the intermediate intention as well.''</p>
        <p>Father O'Rourke said that, in light of the Vatican's instructions, attitudes toward gamete intrafallopian transfer were being reassessed. ''After this document,'' he said, ''I feel that it will have a hard time being accepted.''</p>
        <p>Some secular experts on medical ethics suggested that the consequences of the Vatican's reasoning would diminish, rather than preserve, what the statement called ''the dignity of procreation and of the conjugal union.'' 'Logistical Complication' Seen</p>
        <p>''You'd have to jump through a lot of extra hoops to try to do it acceptably,'' Dr. Annas said. ''It's that kind of logistical complication, which the Church seems to say makes this O.K., that gives people a lot of trouble.''</p>
        <p>Others noted that the Church would bar relatively common nonsurgical procedures while allowing procedures that subject women to major surgery, such as transplantation of Fallopian tubes.</p>
        <p>Church authorities acknowledged that infertility techniques developed specifically by Catholic physicians with the intention of following doctrine had produced uneven results. One method that Catholic hospitals have studied hopefully is tubal ovum transfer, in which an egg is retrieved from a woman's ovary in surgery and then reinserted near the end of the Fallopian tube.</p>
        <p>The egg is supposed to be fertilized by sperm through normal sexual intercourse. ''In a sense you would consider this a preliminary act of love continued through the procedure of positioning the ovum,'' Father Griese said. ''Only nothing happened. No women conceived.''
