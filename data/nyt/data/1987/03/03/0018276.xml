        <p>LEAD: Since Dutch settlers brought bowling to Manhattan and the English played at Bowling Green, the sport has been part of the island's life. By 1840, nearly every block of Broadway from Fulton Street to 14th Street boasted an alley, according to historical accounts.</p>
        <p>Since Dutch settlers brought bowling to Manhattan and the English played at Bowling Green, the sport has been part of the island's life. By 1840, nearly every block of Broadway from Fulton Street to 14th Street boasted an alley, according to historical accounts.</p>
        <p>Manhattan's lanes are still booming. From investment bankers to Broadway dancers to Defense Department employees, people are flocking to set up bowling leagues. Hourlong waits for an open lane have become so common they no longer spark strong complaints. Kathleen Turner, Liza Minelli, Bernadette Peters and the cast of the ''All My Children'' soap opera all fancy Beacon Lanes, an aging second-story alley on Amsterdam Avenue near 77th Street.</p>
        <p>But even as the sport's popularity blooms, bowling alleys themselves are dying in Manhattan, the American birthplace of a pastime dating to ancient Egypt. They take a lot of space that can be more profitably used.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be a nice new condo here,'' the Beacon's manager, Bill Nye, said dryly the other day, referring to what he expects when the bowling alley's lease expires in 1989. 'I Think It's Bleak'</p>
        <p>''What's the future of bowling in Manhattan?'' asked Tom Roballey, director of the Madison Square Garden Bowling Center, the borough's biggest and most modern bowling facility. ''I think it's bleak, I really do.''</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, the number of alleys has shrunk by half, and the four remaining are threatened, bowlers and bowling operators say. It has not been decided whether a new Madison Square Garden, if it is built on Eleventh Avenue, will include a bowling alley. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey does not want to renew the lease for Mid-City Bowling in the bus terminal on Eighth Avenue, Emil Viola, the proprietor, says. Beacon Lanes anticipates closing when the lease of the supermarket downstairs expires in 1989.</p>
        <p>If these all die, only colorful Bowlmor Lanes in Greenwich Village, on University Place, which has 11 years left on its lease, will remain. If it goes, the bowling era in Manhattan will almost certainly be over, bowling operators say.</p>
        <p>''I doubt seriously you'll ever see another bowling center open in Manhattan,'' Mr. Roballey said.</p>
        <p>Manhattan bowlers can, of course, go elsewhere, but even that is becoming more difficult. Over the last eight years, the local affiliate of the American Bowling Congress says, the four boroughs outside Manhattan have lost 37 bowling alleys, leaving 55. On Long Island, the number has dipped by 22, to 74, over the last five years. New Jersey has lost such fabled alleys as the Edison Lanes in Edison, whose 112 lanes were said to have made it the world's biggest.</p>
        <p>For decades, real estate pressures have been exacerbated by the industry's reluctance to raise prices at the expense of losing customers. Now, Mr. Roballey estimates he would need to charge customers $15 a game to pay the kind of rent that Madison Square Garden, owned by Gulf and Western Industries Inc., could fetch from other tenants for the same space. With the price now $2.25, it seems impossible to him and other proprietors to try to catch up. Color-Coded Balls</p>
        <p>The only response might be to move to places once considered inferior for bowling centers, such as basements. ''Maybe we can go to grade B locations,'' said John LaSpina, who just sold Gil Hodges Lanes in Brooklyn - owned by him and his brother - to a drugstore chain.</p>
        <p>Not only is bowling enjoying a surge in popularity, it is also showing off a sharp new look. Largely gone is the image of the beer-swigging truckdriver in those lovable baggy shirts. At the tony places, balls are color-coded as to weight, bags look like fine carry-on luggage and some shoes resemble the deck shoes used for yachting.</p>
        <p>Women, who now make up half the nation's 70 million bowlers, compete in the same leagues as men. Children compete in their own weekend leagues. Notably, bowling will be a demonstration sport in next year's Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>''There are so many good things happening,'' said Jojo Russo, executive director of the New York City Bowling Proprietors Association. Lou Rolls a 256</p>
        <p>Each of Manhattan's bowling centers and most of its bowlers reflect strong personalities. At the dusty, 10-lane Beacon the other evening, a man who would only identify himself as Lou was rolling a commanding 256 score of a possible 300. While an old-timer recalled days long gone when professionals came by to wager $300 or more a game, two others loudly debated the year when machines replaced human pinsetters. (The answer is 1962.) Ten blue-smocked physical therapists from Metropolitan Hospital, some bowling for the first time, cheered everything that was not a gutter ball.</p>
        <p>At Mid-City Bowling in the bus terminal, the manager, Michelle Mitchell, told of a league composed of people working in Broadway shows that assembles Thursdays at midnight, and of a benefit where, for just $50, you can bowl on a team led by your favorite soap opera star.</p>
        <p>She mentioned that the alley boasts one of the few surviving all-women's leagues, the Afternoon Dolls.</p>
        <p>In Madison Square Garden, the 48-lane bowling center seems a peek into the future of an industry that is surging in places like Florida, where land is affordable and people plentiful. Scores are kept automatically and displayed on television screens, and carpets are clean and thick. The only reason there are no chandeliers is that elephants severely shook the ceiling during circuses in the overhead arena and they had to be removed.</p>
        <p>Some 1.5 million people come to the Garden alleys annually, Mr. Roballey says, suggesting this huge flow of people is the Garden's principal advantage in maintaining a bowling center. A sampling of the league entries indicates bowling's upscale appeal: Drexell Burnham, Chase Manhattan, CBS, Wall Street women and Calvin Klein.</p>
        <p>Until one is told Dustin Hoffman stopped by to bowl a few lines the other day, Bowlmor Lanes in Greenwich Village, with its 44 lanes evenly divided between the second and third floors, does not seem upscale. Aging advertisements hang on the walls above the pins. A tattered turn-of-the-century picture shows members of the Bowling Clubs of New York, their beards and mustaches as immaculate as their expressions are self-satisfied. Unchanged is the thud, thud of balls hitting wood.</p>
        <p>Sitting alone in the bar, Herbie Bien, a retired bartender, sips a drink, looks at the alley's sole bartender and recalls the days when at least three bartenders were needed to water the Bowlmor crowd. Five other bowling alleys were a short walk away. ''Now you got one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Theodore Bournis, co-owner, appears to know this. Indeed, he displays a grasp of the fragile future of Manhattan's other bowling alleys, casually noting that his own lease is not up until 1998. Asked how he feels about this, he smiles slightly and says, ''What do you think?''</p>
