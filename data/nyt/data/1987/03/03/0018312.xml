        <p>LEAD: The Mafia is a dying organization and will cease to be a major threat within the next 10 years, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said at a news conference last night after a Federal jury convicted a former chief of the Sicilian Mafia and 16 other defendants of running an international drug ring.</p>
        <p>The Mafia is a dying organization and will cease to be a major threat within the next 10 years, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said at a news conference last night after a Federal jury convicted a former chief of the Sicilian Mafia and 16 other defendants of running an international drug ring.</p>
        <p>''Five or six years ago, nobody would have believed we could convict the head of the Sicilian Mafia in New York,'' Mr. Giuliani said in his office at One St. Andrew's Plaza in lower Manhattan. ''If we continue our efforts, there's not going to be a Mafia in 5 to 10 years.''</p>
        <p>He attributed the verdict yesterday to a ''team effort'' by prosecutors and investigators in the United States, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Turkey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's statements and the conviction yesterday came a day after he opened a weeklong conference in Providence, R.I., on crime in America. 'International Cartel'</p>
        <p>In his speech Sunday night in Providence, Mr. Giuliani attributed what he said was the demise of the Mafia to two factors: the vigorous prosecution under strengthened racketeering laws and the shifting demographics that have made it difficult for Mafia leaders to recruit new members from an upwardly mobile Italian-American community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's statements in Providence went significantly beyond those of other Federal officials who have spoken on organized crime. Last April, a Presidential commission on organized crime said the Mafia remains a dominant force in an underworld that makes $100 billion a year. The commission also warned of more than a dozen other emerging crime groups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani cautioned that the decline of the Mafia did not mean the end of organized crime. He said that 20 to 25 other organizations have begun to occupy the void left by the weakened Mafia.</p>
        <p>He stressed that law-enforcement officials must avoid what he called the mistakes of the last 50 years in dealing - or not dealing - with the Mafia.</p>
        <p>''Because the Federal Government ignored, by and large, the problem of organized crime, we permitted one of these groups to grow from localized street gangs to a national and eventually an international cartel,'' Mr. Giuliani told the conference, which was sponsored by Brown University and The Providence Journal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is one of several Federal prosecutors who have undertaken major cases against Mafia figures in recent years, including one in which it was shown that the Mafia's ''board of directors'' was in itself a criminal enterprise.</p>
        <p>Those prosecutions have disrupted the management of the mafia, he said. Further, prosecutors are pursuing efforts under Federal racketeering laws to seize the assets of the Mafia.</p>
        <p>The problems facing the Mafia are compounded by the improved status of Italian-Americans, he said. He made no pretense that he was talking about anything other than an organized crime group dominated by Italians. He specifically used the word Mafia and said that suggestions in the past that it did not exist only allowed it to grow.</p>
        <p>''The demographics in the Italian-American community have changed so much that they don't have a place to replenish themselves in any kind of numbers that really is significant,'' Mr. Giuliani said of the Mafia.</p>
        <p>''The community they would have reached into to find their recruits in the 1920's and 1930's is a very different community today,'' he continued. ''The people they would have gone to are now in high school, colleges, law school, medical schools, in record numbers, and it's a thing of the past.''</p>
