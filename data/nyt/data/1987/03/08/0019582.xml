        <p>TO catch up on mail, the Home Clinic column is again devoted to answering questions about frequently encountered repair and maintenance problems.</p>
        <p>Q. Although I have hung wallpaper several times before, all the wallpaper I put up involved wallpapers that were pretrimmed. However, now my wife has selected a wallcovering that has a border or edge on each side that must be trimmed off before the material is hung. I tried trimming one strip with a large pair of scissors, but no matter how carefully I worked I couldn't get the edges perfectly straight. Also, it was very time-consuming and I have a lot of paper to hang. Is there a simpler and more foolproof technique you can suggest? - B.L., Paterson, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. To trim the selvage (that's what the waste edge is called), you will need a long straightedge (at least five feet) and a flat HOME CLINIC table or work surface. You can use a sheet of plywood or even a flush door. Place this across two sawhorses. Or you can rent a papering table and straightedge from dealers. Coat the back side of each strip with paste, covering a little more than half the length at first. Fold this end over, pasted side to pasted side, with the pattern on the outside as shown in the drawing. Now slide the folded strip over far enough to permit coating the rest of the strip with paste. Fold this end over just as you did the other end so that the top and bottom of the folded strip meet about in the center as shown. Line up the edges of the folded strip carefully, then use the straightedge and a single-edge razor blade (or razor blade knife) to trim off the selvage along the lines marked on the pattern. Try to make the whole cut with one stroke, and avoid going back and forth with the blade.</p>
        <p>Q. Our house has no basement, and when the season arrives where we shut off the heat, mildew runs rampant inside the house -particularly in one of the large closets. We are trying to find out what is the best method to treat this closet to get rid of the mildew problem. Will putting up one of those heavy-duty liners you recently wrote about solve our problem, or is there something else you can suggest? - M.F., North Merrick, L.I.</p>
        <p>A. Putting up a wall lining won't help much - in fact, it could add to your problems. The first thing I would suggest is adding ventilation to the closet. preferably by installing a louvered door instead of a solid door. Next, make sure there are exhaust fans in the kitchen and in the bathrooms, and make sure the dryer (if you have one) is vented directly to the outside. Minimize the number of house plants, and do what you can to lower indoor humidity (air-conditioning helps a lot in warm weather). Wash the mildew off with a solution of one part Clorox and five parts water. Let this dry on the surface, then rinse with water. When you repaint, use a mildew-resistant paint, and if you repaper, use a wallcovering and an adhesive that are mildew-resistant.</p>
        <p>Q. All houses in my area have septic tanks, and I have a problem with my toilet flushing properly. Solid waste swirls around and the water runs out, but the solids only rarely go out with the water. If I pour a bucket of water rapidly into the bowl, it flushes completely. When I actuate the handle, water comes into the bowl and starts to swirl around, then the stopper inside the tank closes and the tank begins refilling. I have changed the stopper assembly and the refilling mechanism and have run a snake down through the vent pipe from the roof. I have also run a snake down into the bowl. Do you think I need a new toilet bowl, or do you have any other suggestions? - L.E.L., Newton, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Since the toilet flushes well when you pour in a bucket of water, I would suspect that not enough water is coming into the bowl, or it is not coming in fast enough. Make sure the stopper inside the tank (I assume you mean the tank ball or flapper valve at the bottom) is not closing too soon - it should not close until the tank is almost empty - and make sure that when the tank refills, it is filling as high as it should (about half an inch below the top of the vertical overflow tube in the center). If all these are all right, it could be there is a partial blockage inside the bowl. Cleaning this out may require removing the bowl so it can be turned over to work on it. If the blockage cannot be freed, it could be that the toilet bowl will have to be replaced. Q. We have a stand-alone garage that is about 20 feet from the house. There is a brick patio between the house and the garage. What is the best way to install lighting in this garage? - J.M.P., Port Washington, L.I.</p>
        <p>A. I guess you mean the best way to run wiring for the garage lights from the house. Overhead cables are one possibility, but you have to get them up high enough so there is no danger of a car or a person touching them (some localities have restrictions on such wiring, so check with your building department on this). Probably the safest method is to run the cables underground, using the special cable approved for this purpose, or using underground conduit with cables inside (again, check local codes). If the brick patio does not permit burying the wires without digging up the patio, then you may have to run the cable or conduit through surface-mounted raceways built along the edge of the patio. Some local codes require that you hire a licensed electrician to do this work.</p>
        <p>Q. Water coming up through the cement floor of our basement forms large puddles that are up to half an inch deep. Mopping is futile because the water immediately rises again. A sump pump in one corner of the basement comes on at regular intervals and we hear water gurgling through the pipes -but we still need to wear rubbers when we go down to the basement. Can you give any advice on this? - J.F., Norwalk, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. First of all, you don't say where the sump pump is discharging its water. The water should be going at least 10 feet away from the house, otherwise it could be that the water is being recirculated. Also, there should be a trench around the perimeter of the basement floor that holds drain tiles that will catch the water and direct it to the sump pump so that water will not accumulate on the floor (the sump pump should be recessed into the lowest corner).</p>
        <p>In serious cases, however, this may not be enough. Chances are that you need to dig down around the outside of the foundation walls, then install the drain tiles around the outside of the footing, rather than on the inside. These drain tiles would still have to carry the water away to an underground dry well or sump at least 10 feet away. Q. I have a 30-year-old teakwood dresser that I maintain by rubbing with boiled linseed oil every year or two, whenever the spirit moves me. However, I spilled two large splashes of perfume on this finish, creating stains that I have never been able to eradicate. How can I repair the mess that I made? - E.S., Teaneck, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Most perfumes have strong solvents that will attack most finishes. That's why most such stains cannot be removed. You have to strip all the old finish off with paint remover, then apply a new finish. You can also try using one of the refinishing liquids sold in many paint and hardware stores. These are designed to soften and partly remove the old finish without stripping it completely. Follow the directions on the can, and if it works, refinish that surface with a penetrating sealer such as the type recommended by the manufacturer of the refinishing liquid.</p>
        <p>Q. We live in a lovely wood frame house that is over 200 years old. After living in this house for 10 years, this year I've noticed a white, powdery accumulation which I assume to be mildew on the wood walls and ceiling in the attic. The attic is unheated and has an exhaust fan vented directly to the outside. This keeps things pretty cold up there in the winter. Is there anything I should be doing about this, or should I just wait for the condition to clear up in warm weather? -W.H.C., Norwalk, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. Mildew should not be ignored. However, most mildew is not white, so I cannot be sure from your description that it is mildew. If it is, it should wash off easily with a solution of Clorox and water (one to five). To minimize future growth, more ventilation is probably needed in the attic - perhaps you need vents along the eaves, or the fan is not large enough. If it is not mildew, I can't say what it is. Try washing it off with vinegar and water to see if it comes back, or see if there are signs of sawdust mixed in with it. The latter condition could indicate an insect problem.</p>
