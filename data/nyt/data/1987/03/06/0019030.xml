        <p>LEAD: Federated Department Stores filled a gap in its top management yesterday by electing Norman S. Matthews president and chief operating officer, its No. 2 position.</p>
        <p>Federated Department Stores filled a gap in its top management yesterday by electing Norman S. Matthews president and chief operating officer, its No. 2 position.</p>
        <p>The company, which operates a number of retail chains including Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and Filene's, had left the position vacant since 1982, when Howard Goldfeder became chairman and chief executive. Mr. Matthews, who is 54 years old, had been one of four Federated vice chairmen since 1984.</p>
        <p>Like most of its store divisions, Federated now has a tandem top management. According to Mr. Goldfeder, that structure will allow it to attack two challenges after four years of restructuring and repositioning its assets. ''Norman will have the responsibility of maximizing the productivity of our existing assets while I will make it my main task to develop long-term directions and opportunities,'' Mr. Goldfeder said.</p>
        <p>In a related move, Allen I. Questrom was named corporate executive vice president and will remain chairman and chief executive officer of the Bullock's and Bullock's-Wilshire department store division in Los Angeles. He will now be responsible for both the Filene's and The Children's Place divisions.</p>
        <p>Federated is seeking to retain its top position among retail chains, but has faced a strong challenge from the May Department Stores. Last October, May acquired the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, greatly expanding its geographical reach.</p>
        <p>In the nine months ended Nov. 1, Federated's sales rose 4.7 percent, but net income declined 1.4 percent. ''We can't talk right now about the final quarter,'' Mr. Goldfeder said in a telephone interview, ''but we think we are doing very well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews is a Bostonian who grew up in New York. A graduate of Princeton University and the Harvard Business School, he was a partner in Beacon Marketing Consultants and marketing vice president of Broyhill Furniture Industries before joining Korvettes Inc., where he rose to executive vice president and general merchandise manager.</p>
