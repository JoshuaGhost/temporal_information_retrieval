        <p>LEAD: Federated Department Stores Inc. said today that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent. The May Department Stores Company, meanwhile, reported a 9 percent profit increase.</p>
        <p>Federated Department Stores Inc. said today that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent. The May Department Stores Company, meanwhile, reported a 9 percent profit increase.</p>
        <p>Federated said its fourth-quarter earnings totaled $171.2 million, or $3.64 a share, up from $154 million, or $3.16 a share, a year ago. Sales were $3.44 billion, a 6.5 percent increase from $3.23 billion for the corresponding quarter of 1985, the retailer said.</p>
        <p>Earnings for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 were $287.6 million, or $5.94 a share, up three-tenths of 1 percent from earnings of $286.6 million, or $5.88 a share, in the previous year. Sales were $10.51 billion, an increase of 5.3 percent over 1985 sales of $9.98 billion.</p>
        <p>Profit figures reflected a $14.3 million charge resulting from the early retirement of $297 million in debt, the retailer said. They also reflect $15.7 million spent on the merger of Federated's Foley's and Sanger-Harris divisions in Texas. Federated's holdings include the Burdine's, Bullock's-Wilshire, Bloomingdale's, Filene's and Rich's chains.</p>
        <p>May reported fourth-quarter earnings of $213 million, or $1.38 a share, up from $195 million, or $1.24 a share. Sales for the quarter were $3.36 billion, up 8 percent from $3.1 billion.</p>
        <p>For the full year, May reported earnings of $381 million, or $2.44 a share, up nearly 10 percent from $347 million, or $2.20 a share, in 1985. Sales for the year totaled a record $10.33 billion, up nearly 9 percent from $9.49 billion in 1985.</p>
        <p>May, which late last year acquired the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, operates the Lord &amp; Taylor, Caldor, Volume Shoe, Venture, Hecht, Famous Barr and Loehmann's chains.</p>
