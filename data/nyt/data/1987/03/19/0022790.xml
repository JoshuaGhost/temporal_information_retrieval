        <p>LEAD: As the death toll from AIDS continues to mount and hopes recede for developing a vaccine or cure any time soon, the nation is turning more vigorously and more desperately to the only available defenses against the epidemic: prevention.</p>
        <p>As the death toll from AIDS continues to mount and hopes recede for developing a vaccine or cure any time soon, the nation is turning more vigorously and more desperately to the only available defenses against the epidemic: prevention.</p>
        <p>Educational and public health measures to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus from person to person are gaining momentum. The campaign has already spurred a broad awareness of AIDS throughout much of the country and important changes in behavior among some people thought to be most at risk. But no one believes that nearly enough has been done.</p>
        <p>In New York and New Jersey, former drug addicts have been hired to roam the streets, warning addicts who inject heroin and cocaine into their veins that contaminated needles can spread the virus and that they should either give up their habit or sterilize their needles. 'Safer Sex' Badges</p>
        <p>In the homosexual bars of New York City, some worried homosexuals are wearing safety pins as a sign that they will practice only ''safer sex,'' refusing anal and oral intercourse without the protection of a condom.</p>
        <p>In a majority of the nation's largest school systems, educators have introduced new and sometimes controversial lessons about AIDS, teaching youngsters how to avoid the disease, either by abstaining from sex and drugs or, if abstinence is refused, using condoms and shunning the most risky behaviors.</p>
        <p>And in a rising number of states around the country, public health officials are stepping up efforts to track the spread of the virus through the population, to encourage possible victims to get themselves tested and to warn the sex or needle-sharing partners of those found infected that they, too, may be in danger.</p>
        <p>The campaign is facing enormous obstacles but is also achieving some unexpected successes in seedy locations far from public view. Jerry De Jong, a 30-year-old drug abuse counselor in San Francisco, was greeted with suspicion when he first ventured into two areas of the city that have concentrations of drug addicts and prostitutes. But by hanging around the neighborhood, handing out free cigarettes and making it clear he was not a police officer, he gradually won the confidence of the outcasts.</p>
        <p>For the addicts, he offered vials of bleach to sterilize their needles or referrals to drug abuse treatment centers. To the prostitutes, he handed out condoms, as many as 600 a week in all.</p>
        <p>One of his most difficult clients was a transsexual prostitute and drug addict who was infected with the AIDS virus and presumably spreading it to her customers and fellow addicts.</p>
        <p>At first she insisted that her customers would never accept condoms. So one day in August, Mr. De Jong took sexual paraphernalia to her room and spent an hour and a half demonstrating how easily a condom could be applied. He blew up some 25 condoms like balloons, giving the room a festive appearance as prostitutes and addicts gathered there to hear his lecture on avoiding AIDS.</p>
        <p>''It got the message across,'' Mr. De Jong said. ''The transsexual now reports that she is now using both bleach and condoms regularly.'' #3 Ways of Spreading Virus These emerging prevention efforts all seek to give people information that will enable them to protect themselves from a virus that, for all practical purposes, is spread in only three ways, all of which can be avoided: sexual intercourse with an infected person, inoculation of the virus into the bloodstream, or transmission from an infected pregnant woman to the fetus inside her.</p>
        <p>But persuading many of those most at risk to protect themselves is proving to be a formidable task, health officials say. Drug addicts desperate for their next fix and accustomed to using whatever needle is handy, dirty or not, are now being asked to think instead of the long-term consequences. Swinging singles who have thrived on the sexual freedom of the past two decades are now being told that monogamy, or at least condoms, may save their lives.</p>
        <p>Most homosexual men are believed to be aware of the danger and many report that they have changed their behavior. But officials worry that some who only occasionally engage in homosexual intercourse may not realize just how rampant the AIDS virus already is among homsexuals and how risky even a single unprotected encounter can be.</p>
        <p>Never before have public health officials been able to extinguish an epidemic by changing human behavior on a mass scale. But until scientists come up with an effective drug or vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, there is no other choice, experts agree.  Agencies Gear Up</p>
        <p>Officials have used some of the traditional public health methods for combating the epidemic but have been slow to put others into effect, either because they would not work effectively against AIDS or because of concern that AIDS victims would suffer unjustified discrimination in jobs, schools, housing or insurance coverage.</p>
        <p>The fight against AIDS has been hampered from the start, many experts say, by the historical accident that, in the United States, the virus first afflicted homosexual men and intravenous drug users, two outcast groups whose ways of life had already subjected them to abuse and discrimination. Thus any measures identifying or drawing attention to an AIDS victim carried a strong likelihood of causing the victim social damage as well.</p>
        <p>The Federal Centers for Disease Control quickly mounted an effective surveillance system to track the spread of full-fledged AIDS, an advanced stage of infection in which the victim's immune system has become so damaged that other illnesses are lethal. The surveillance system depends on doctors and health officials to report all cases of AIDS they see. Despite sporadic reports that cases are being covered up because of the stigma of AIDS, most health authorities believe the reporting system is quite accurate and comprehensive in charting the course of the full-fledged disease.</p>
        <p>Where the surveillance falls down, all experts agree, is in tracking the spread of the virus, which often smolders silently in a person for years before causing symptoms of AIDS.</p>
        <p>One pathway for the virus has been virtually cut off: medical transfusions and blood products. In 1985, a laboratory test was introduced to detect the antibodies to the AIDS virus, enabling blood banks to screen all donations. The blood banks also counsel anyone who has had a homosexual experience or injected drugs in recent years not to donate blood, with the result that most authorities consider the blood supply as safe as it has ever been.</p>
        <p>Now health officials are beginning to make more systematic use of the blood test to track the virus in the population. A recent national conference of health officials vetoed the idea of mandatory blood tests to look for the virus in all hospital patients or marriage license applicants. Experts concluded that the cost would be enormous, relatively few infected people would be found and civil rights would be unnecessarily endangered.</p>
        <p>Instead, health officials have begun to screen, on an anonymous basis, discarded blood from selected hospitals around the country, and they are increasing the volume of voluntary testing at drug clinics, venereal disease clinics and other places where infected people are likely to be found.</p>
        <p>A few cities are also contacting the sexual partners of infected people to warn them of their risk. This is a traditional method for fighting venereal diseases, but it has not been widely used against AIDS, partly because there is no treatment to offer the victims and partly because the social stigma of AIDS makes it difficult to gain cooperation in tracing sex partners.  Drug Addicts: Crucial Target</p>
        <p>The most urgent target of the prevention campaign, according to many authorities, is the intravenous drug users who make up the second largest group of AIDS victims, after homosexual men. The drug addicts are far behind the homosexuals in organizing to protect themselves, and they pose the greatest immediate threat of spreading the virus to the heterosexual population through intercourse with their sex partners, experts say.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming majority of the AIDS cases attributed to heterosexual transmission so far have been caused by intravenous drug users, especially in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>In New York City, almost 90 percent of the cases attributed to heterosexual contact have involved the sex partners of intravenous drug users, state drug officials say. There has been very little further transmission from those sex partners to others, although health officials worry that this may increase in the future. Poor black and Hispanic residents of Northeastern cities have been especially afflicted by drug-related AIDS.</p>
        <p>''The problem will not burn out,'' said Don C. Des Jarlais, coordinator for AIDS research in the New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services. ''Probably 95 percent of all heavy drug users in this country are active heterosexuals,'' he said. ''Unless we get them all to use safe sex, we face a problem of heterosexual transmission which could become self-sustaining.''</p>
        <p>The AIDS virus probably first entered the addict community from infected homosexuals who were also drug users. Once it gained a foothold, the virus spread rapidly, infecting 40 percent or more of the addicts in various cities around the world within a few years, according to published reports.</p>
        <p>The social custom of sharing needles spread the virus among friends and acquaintances, and the ''shooting galleries'' in such cities as New York and Newark, where addicts can rent injection equipment and return it for rental to other customers, spread the virus quickly. Blood tests performed on several thousand addicts in New York City suggest that 50 percent to 60 percent of the city's 200,000 addicts already carry the virus.</p>
        <p>So far the infected addicts, who are far less mobile than the typical homosexual man, have not spread the virus rapidly to other parts of the country. Drug-related AIDS has been most prevalent in New York and northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In an effort to curb further drug-related spread, officials have started new programs to reach both the addicts and their sex partners.</p>
        <p>New York State has trained 30 to 40 former addicts to go into areas of high drug use, where they urge addicts to take a blood test to see if they are infected, to seek treatment for their addiction, to stop sharing needles or at least to clean their needles and syringes with bleach or alcohol.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has hired 28 former addicts to warn drug users how to avoid AIDS and to dispense coupons that entitle the addicts to three free weeks of detoxification at a treatment center. Some 85 percent of the coupons have been redeemed, according to Dr. Ronald Altman, medical director of the state's AIDS program.</p>
        <p>In San Francisco, outreach workers have passed out thousands of small plastic vials of bleach so that drug users could sterilize their needles and syringes, and in Chicago, addicts and former addicts have also been hired to hand out bleach, literature and condoms.</p>
        <p>One measure that has been tried in Europe is to provide sterile needles to any addicts who want them. That has yet to be tried in the United States because of strong opposition from law-enforcement officials, who fear it would encourage drug addiction. The effectiveness of such programs in stopping the virus has not been demonstrated, Dr. Des Jarlais said, but officials in New York City plan to conduct a small research project to evaluate the approach.</p>
        <p>Changing the behavior of addicts, who are generally considered to have little concern for their own health and a strong aversion to public officials, is often portrayed as impossible. But there is some evidence that fear of AIDS is already having a beneficial effect. Surveys of addicts in New York City in 1984 and 1985 showed that more than half had altered their needle use, mostly by making greater use of sterile equipment or reducing the number of people with whom they shared needles.</p>
        <p>It may be too little too late. ''We have not yet stopped transmission of the virus,'' Dr. Des Jarlais said. ''It's very difficult to make sure that an addict always uses equipment that's not contaminated. ''Prevention efforts need to be increased by a factor of 10 if we are going to be serious about stopping transmission of the AIDS virus,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A crucial underlying problem, officials say, is a shortage of treatment programs for addicts who do seek help in beating their deadly habit. Even before the AIDS epidemic, addicts had to wait three months or more to gain admission to treatment programs in New York City. Health officials are increasing the number of treatment slots and reserving some slots for addicts reached by the AIDS workers. But even so, Dr. Des Jarlais said, ''We need to be providing much more treatment.'' In New Jersey, Dr. Altman added, ''Our treatment centers are being overwhelmed.''  Private Groups: A Pivotal Role</p>
        <p>Virtually all experts agree that strong educational campaigns are needed, including measures aimed specifically at groups such as schoolchildren, college students, minority groups and people who are particularly vulnerable to infection such as prostitutes or the sex partners of intravenous drug users.</p>
        <p>Federal efforts to mount a national AIDS education campaign have been slowed by arguments over ''dirty words'' in proposed information brochures and by high-level disagreements over whether education should stress abstinence from sex and drugs or safe ways to partake of sex and drugs. Only this week, after sharp criticism in Congress, did the Reagan Administration issue its plan.</p>
        <p>Under the new strategy, the Government will provide accurate information about AIDS to states and communities, but will leave it to local officials and school districts to decide precisely what is taught. While the possible value of condoms in preventing transmission of the AIDS virus will be noted, the report said that education should emphasize ''responsible sexual behavior - based on fidelity, commitment and maturity, placing sexuality within the context of marriage.''</p>
        <p>Federal officials have some ambitious measures in mind, including mass media advertising and the mailing of AIDS literature to every household in the nation, Meanwhile, schools, colleges and private groups around the country have raced ahead to develop their own programs, sometimes with Federal aid.</p>
        <p>Some of the most vigorous and imaginative AIDS education programs have been mounted by private groups, particularly organizations that sprang up to cope with the health crisis among homosexuals. The Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, for example, has been showing a film on safer sex techniques that promises ''hot action'' that will ''keep sex sleazy, tender, impulsive'' and not make it boring.</p>
        <p>In Minnesota, Captain Condom, a muscular actor dressed in a blue uniform with a hot-pink cape, has bounded into homosexual bars to distribute safe sex guidelines and condoms, and the Good Fairy of Safe Sex, another actor dressed in drag, has waved a wand over homosexual audiences and showered them with more condoms.</p>
        <p>These novel measures are sponsored by the Minnesota AIDS Project, which also conducts workshops, a telephone hot line, visits to the schools, and public advertising.</p>
        <p>The Health Issues Task Force of Cleveland has taught bartenders, a frequent source of neighborhood counseling, how to promote safe sex, and the Philadelphia AIDS Task Force has produced a ''rap'' record on AIDS that has been played in discotheques and on radio stations, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, which has channeled funds to many projects.</p>
        <p>The highly motivated, generally well-educated homosexual groups have taken the lead in AIDS education. But now such mainstream organizations as the American Red Cross, and shortly the health and life insurance trade associations, are distributing brochures about AIDS. Many colleges have begun to promote safer sexual practices, sometimes by handing out free condoms.</p>
        <p>The most important educational tools by far, virtually all experts agree, have been the news media. Yet many people still do not know much about AIDS and only a minority are changing their sexual behavior, national polls indicate.</p>
        <p>In January a poll of 800 adults for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that only 7 percent had changed their sexual behavior after becoming aware of AIDS, precisely the same percentage as was found 11 months earlier. In a CBS News poll of 823 adults last October, 41 percent of the respondents said they did not know much about AIDS and only 11 percent had changed their sexual habits because of fear of AIDS. But twice as many of the youngest adults, or 23 percent of those under 30, had taken sexual precautions.</p>
        <p>The most encouraging results were found in a poll of 1,511 adults for ABC News and The Washington Post this month. Some 37 percent of the sample, and fully half of those under 35, were taking steps to avoid exposing themselves to AIDS, up from 22 percent in September 1985. The most common changes were cutting down or eliminating sexual contacts.  Schools Take Action</p>
        <p>A survey of 73 of the country's largest school districts, conducted in December by the United States Conference of Mayors, found that 40 were already providing AIDS education and 24 others were planning such programs. Similarly, 17 of 25 states that responded to the survey were developing or planned such programs.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised by the amount that was already going on,'' said Richard Johnson, director of health programs for the mayors' group.</p>
        <p>Most of the programs were at the high school or junior high school level. ''At the elementary level, there was almost nothing,'' Mr. Johnson said. San Francisco, one of the cities hit hardest by AIDS, was a notable exception, starting AIDS education in the fifth grade.</p>
        <p>Virtually all the school programs describe how AIDS is transmitted and most cite explicit ways to avoid infection. ''Abstinence is the best protection,'' says a New York City teacher's guide, but ''the use of condoms and avoidance of anal intercourse'' can reduce the threat, too.</p>
        <p>The New York City schools provide two AIDS lessons to both junior and senior high school students as part of the the family living and sex education curriculum. The high school program devotes an entire lesson to civil rights issues raised by the blood tests that detect infection with AIDS, including the possibility that infected people would face discrimination.</p>
        <p>The schools are a crucial target for AIDS prevention, because students are reaching the age where many experiment with sex and drugs. But whether the brief AIDS lessons are having any major effect is not yet known.</p>
        <p>''Whatever is going on in the schools right now is inadequate,'' said Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, chief of the office of school health at the Centers for Disease Control. ''Many schools and communities lack the information and resources to implement a good program.''  Harsh Views Of the Effort</p>
        <p>All of these efforts together, most experts assert, still fall far short of what is needed to arrest the epidemic.</p>
        <p>The fledgling prevention campaign has been slowed by uncertainties over how catastrophic the epidemic really threatens to become, squeamishness over frank discussion of sexual and drug practices, and concerns about threats to the civil rights of AIDS virus carriers and AIDS victims. Most debilitating of all, some experts say, has been a lack of strong Federal leadership and a failure to commit the resources that leading health experts believe are necessary.</p>
        <p>The United States Public Health Service plans to spend $79.5 million on AIDS information and education in the current fiscal year and almost $104 million the following year, according to testimony presented to a House subcommittee on Monday. But critics consider those amounts only a fraction of what is needed. The National Academy of Sciences charged in October that the Federal response to AIDS had been ''woefully inadequate'' and called for expenditures on education and public health measures to reach $1 billion a year by the end of the decade, much of it from Federal sources.</p>
        <p>''After almost six years of an epidemic, the Federal Government has utterly failed to undertake a massive public education campaign aimed at preventing the spread of AIDS,'' the Gay Men's Health Crisis asserted in a statement recently distributed by the New York group.</p>
        <p>''We're not even thinking in the right ball park,'' said Harvey V. Fineberg, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, who served on the Academy of Sciences committee.</p>
        <p>''The task of transferring information on AIDS is enormous and the task of bahavior modification is mind-boggling,'' Mr. Fineberg said. ''The difference between what we are expecting people to do and the amount we are spending on it suggests to me that we are off by an order of magnitude.''  THE SERIES ON AIDS</p>
        <p>Part 1, on Monday, reported on the far-reaching impact of AIDS on New York City's life and spirit. Part 2, on Tuesday, described the hopes and frustrations in the search for new treatments, even as thousands of AIDS patients receive the first promising drug. Part 3, yesterday, reported that despite rapid progress in a worldwide research effort, a vaccine against AIDS may not be available for many years, if ever.</p>
