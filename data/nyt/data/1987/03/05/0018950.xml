        <p>LEAD: Greece lodged what it termed a strong protest with the United States today over the partial demolition of offices used by a Greek labor union at an American military base here.</p>
        <p>Greece lodged what it termed a strong protest with the United States today over the partial demolition of offices used by a Greek labor union at an American military base here.</p>
        <p>The incident, analysts said, offered a reminder of continued friction and political sensitivities in relations between the two NATO allies despite what both sides call a ''step by step'' effort to improve them.</p>
        <p>The United States Embassy here said in a statement that military personnel at Hellenikon base, situated at the main civilian airport of Athens, gave notice last year of their plan to move the union to ''equivalent or better'' offices nearby.</p>
        <p>The union represents many of the 770 Greeks employed at the logistics and communication base and has been held responsible by Americans for a disruptive strike in 1984. Government Asked Postponement</p>
        <p>Diplomats said the Greek protest, lodged by Yannis Kapsis, a senior Foreign Ministry official, centered on the apparent refusal of the base commander, Col. Ray Rider, to heed a request by the Socialist Government to postpone the demolition.</p>
        <p>The embassy statement said Colonel Rider had ordered the action under Greek-American agreements so as to acquire ''sorely needed space'' for other, unspecified needs.</p>
        <p>The leftist labor union, whose office walls were knocked down earlier in the week, has protested the action to the Greek authorities. The union is also said to have refused to move to the proposed new offices.</p>
        <p>The United States has four major military installations in Greece, including an important naval base in Crete. The American military presence includes 4,500 American personnel and dependents, about 1,300 of them at the Hellenikon base.</p>
        <p>An agreement governing the presence of the bases is due to expire next year. When it was signed in 1983, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, a Socialist, said the bases would be closed in 1988. Moreover, before his election in 1981, Mr. Papandreou called for a withdrawal of Greece from NATO and the severing of its military relationship with the United States. Position Has Shifted</p>
        <p>But recently his tone has mellowed, because, according to Western diplomats, Mr. Papandreou feels NATO membership and American military aid is vital to offset what is seen as an expansionist threat from neighboring Turkey, which is both a NATO ally and Greece's main potential adversary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Papandreou seems to want to handle this shift in a gradual way that will not seem like a total reverse. Thus, in a low-key manner in recent weeks, Greece and the United States have reached agreements on issues including the continued presence of Voice of America relay stations. At the same time, protests such as today's seek to defuse the nationalistic sensitivites of those who argue that the American presence encroaches on Greek sovereignty.</p>
