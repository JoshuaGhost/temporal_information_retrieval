        <p>INTERNATIONAL A2-9  An Israeli will give up a promotion because of the problems it had caused between Israel and the United States.

A9  In Siberia, remains of labor camps were shown to Western reporters. The Kolyma camps were where prisoners of the Stalin era were housed between their shifts at hard labor. A1  Margaret Thatcher's Soviet visit is a ''historic mission'' for peace, she said. But the British Prime Minister's first full day in the country had the tone and trappings of an election campaign at home. A8  An emigration plan for Soviet Jews will send emigres to Israel by way of Rumania, making it more difficult for them to settle in Europe or the United States instead, said an American rabbi who said he had negotiated the new procedure. A8  The Pope beatified five people in a move that could revive old disputes in Spain. Three of the five were Carmelite nuns who were executed in one of the most vicious phases of the Spanish Civil War. A7  News analysis: Andreas Papandreou faced down what was depicted in Greece as an American-backed threat from Turkey. But he traded short-term domestic political gains for long-term economic and diplomatic liabilities. A2  In Haiti, voter turnout was huge and political leaders and American observers said the voting seemed overwhelmingly in favor of a new constitution that promises freedom from past tyrannies. A3  P. W. Botha has begun his campaign for election with charges about the source of his opponents' funds and an excursion into the territory of his far-right rivals. A whites-only election is on May 6. A3  Japan is seen as an unfair trader by many in Washington, who resent that the world's second-largest economy exports everywhere but is reluctant to open its own markets. D1  News analysis: Chip dispute D11  NATIONAL A10-17, B6  The U.S. dollar plunged further against the yen today, at one point hitting a record low of 144.70 yen in the Tokyo foreign exchange market. This was the lowest since modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940's. A1  The President lobbied vigorously over the weekend to sustain his veto of an $88 billion highway and mass transit bill that would also allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles per hour on rural Interstates. A1  A Marine guard's conflicting stories about how he became entangled with a Soviet agent at the American Embassy in Moscow were told to investigators in three seperate interviews last year. The guard is accused of espionage. A1  Electrical power during nuclear war could be generated by several hundred small nuclear reactors that the Air Force is considering building, say Air Force, Department of Energy, Congressional and industry officials. A13  Protecting Nebraska's Platte River is the aim of an Audubon Society campaign. Conservationists say sandhill cranes are threatened by plans to divert the river for municipal and agricultural use. A10  The Supreme Court's senior liberal, William J. Brennan Jr., has written or assigned the majority opinions in all five of this term's most important decisions. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has consistently dissented. A10  The move off welfare and into a job is being made easier for people who live in Massachusetts, Michigan and about 22 other states that have been experimenting with intensive counseling, education and training programs. A14  Was a snowwoman obscene, art or just a pile of snow? Milwaukee's Chief Prosecutor will consider the question as he decides whether to try a woman for taking her ax to a snow sculpture of a woman in a bikini.

Kennedy High School in the Bronx and suburban New Rochelle High School, reveals that racial and ethnic divisions remain. New Rochelle's schools superintendent says the high school is desegregated, ''but I'm not sure if it fulfills the ideal of an integrated school. I'm not sure the ideal of an integrated school exists in our country today.'' A1  An Arturo Toscanini collection of scores, letters, recordings and memorabilia that has been inaccessible since 1970 has been acquired by the New York Public Library under an agreement concluded last December. A1  Foster-care will not be withdrawn this summer, John Cardinal O'Connor said, setting aside his threat to stop Roman Catholic group services because a Federal court has requires that teen-agers be given birth control and abortion services. The Cardinal plans a court appeal. B1  Tuberculosis among homeless men in New York City is a rapidly growing problem, health officials say. The outbreak is so serious that last summer the city began sending health workers into the shelters to deliver medication. B1  A trash-energy plant was destroyed in Westbury, L.I. It had stood unused for seven years. A new, $350 million incineration plant is to be built on the site on Meadowbrook Parkway.
