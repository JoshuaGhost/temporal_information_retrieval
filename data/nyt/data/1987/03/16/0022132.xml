        <p>LEAD: Visa U.S. Inc., responding swiftly to the American Express Company's announcement last week that it would introduce a revolving credit card, has asked its issuing banks to reconsider their sale of American Express traveler's checks and other products.</p>
        <p>Visa U.S. Inc., responding swiftly to the American Express Company's announcement last week that it would introduce a revolving credit card, has asked its issuing banks to reconsider their sale of American Express traveler's checks and other products.</p>
        <p>In a telegram to the 5,500 banks that issue Visa cards, Visa's president, C.T. Russell, said Friday that the new American Express card ''is positioned to be directly competitive with your Visa and Mastercard portfolios.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell suggested that the banks call James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman of American Express, ''to voice your displeasure over his decision to enter one of your most profitable lines of service.'' Mr. Russell also encouraged the banks ''to rethink'' offering such American Express products as checks and premium cards. 'No Hostile Reaction'</p>
        <p>American Express said Friday that the response to Visa's telegram had been minimal. ''The switchboard has not exactly lit up,'' said Walter Montgomery, senior vice president for corporate affairs. ''So far we've had four calls from banks and, to my knowledge, there has been no hostile reaction.''</p>
        <p>But sources at several major commercial banks, who asked not to be identified, said that, while the banks declined to comment on the Visa letter, most felt that the new Optima card was directly competitive with their credit cards and that they would review their relationship with American Express. Visa cards and Mastercards are issued through associations of institutions such as banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations.</p>
        <p>When American Express announced the Optima card last Tuesday, it said that it would offer it only to those who have been American Express card holders for at least a year. It added that it expected about 2.5 million of its 17 million United States card holders to accept the card over the next three years. Lower Interest Rate</p>
        <p>The Optima would cost $15 a year, on top of the fees American Express charges for its other cards, but it would offer revolving credit at a 13.5 percent annual interest rate, considerably lower than the 17 percent or more charged by most big banks on the cards they offer. American Express card holders are now required to pay their bills in full except in limited circumstances.</p>
        <p>Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive of Mastercard, said that his company had expected the introduction of the Optima card and would not be joining Visa in appealing to the banks for support. He added that Mastercard came out with a business card, gold card and traveler's checks last year to compete directly with American Express products.</p>
        <p>The Consumer Federation of America, a Washington-based lobbying group, accused Visa of using ''anti-competitive, strong-arm tactics'' in its telegram to the banks. The organization said that it had asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Visa was acting to restrain trade.</p>
        <p>The group plans to cite the telegram at a hearing Wednesday on credit card legislation before the House Banking Committee's Consumer Affairs Subcommittee. The group said the telegram was evidence that major credit card companies had no intention of lowering interest rates. Direct Competition Cited</p>
        <p>Wayne Johnson, executive vice president of Visa, said yesterday that Visa had no intention of restraining trade. In sending out the telegram, Mr. Johnson said, the company was simply informing the banks that, because the Optima card would be in direct competition with their credit cards, they should reconsider selling the products of a major competitor.</p>
        <p>American Express has said that its Optima card is not intended to go head-to-head with Visa, and that the card would do well to get much more than two million holders.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Johnson of Visa predicted that most of those customers would be holders of gold or premium cards attracted by the lower interest rate on a revolving credit card. He said that, with the Optima card, American Express was aiming at gold card holders because they bring in the most profits.</p>
        <p>Of the 150 million holders of bank credit cards, less than 10 million have gold cards. However, gold card members represent about 40 percent of profits, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Visa estimates that, if American Express captures only 25 percent of the gold card base with its Optima gold card, it would take away about $1 billion in interest revenue and about $125 million in fee revenue from the earnings base of the banking industry.</p>
