        <p>LEAD: A special task force appointed by Governor Cuomo has sharply attacked Federal authorities for failing to enforce the anti-discrimination provisions of the new Federal immigration law, and called for urgent action to curb abuses.</p>
        <p>A special task force appointed by Governor Cuomo has sharply attacked Federal authorities for failing to enforce the anti-discrimination provisions of the new Federal immigration law, and called for urgent action to curb abuses.</p>
        <p>According to the 10-member task force, the Justice Department has failed to appoint a special counsel to enforce the provisions, as required in the new law; has not set up a mechanism for complaints of violations, and has not sufficiently detailed the penalties faced by employers who dismiss workers unfairly or discriminate in hiring.</p>
        <p>More than 64 cases of discrimination related to the act have been documented, as well as numerous threats of unjustified dismissals, according to the task force, headed by Cesar A. Perales, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Social Services. Several other heads of state agencies are members of the panel.</p>
        <p>Cases of simliar dismissals and discrimination have been reported in other states as well. ''The Federal default has had an alarming effect,'' Mr. Perales said in a letter to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that accompanies the report. Law's Impact on State</p>
        <p>The 52-page report to the Governor, to be made public today, describes the enormous impact that the Immigration Reform and Control Act is expected to have on New York State, which has as many as 1.5 million undocumented aliens.</p>
        <p>The Immigration Act, which became law in November, provides for the legalization of undocumented aliens who can prove continuous presence in this country since January 1982. It says that those who entered the country after January 1982 will be subject to deportation, and employers who hire them can be penalized.</p>
        <p>The law also specifically prohibits employment-related discrimination based on ''national origin or citizenship status'' and says that a special counsel should enforce this provision.</p>
        <p>Deborah Burstion-Wade, a spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington, said that it was ''erroneous'' to suggest the department was neglecting its duties. She said the hiring of a counsel would be announced soon, as would the establishment of a complaint mechanism and penalties. Recommendations Included</p>
        <p>The task force report also includes specific recommendations from state agencies on how to cope with these problems and indicates that substantial new financing will be required.</p>
        <p>In a memorandum to the Governor, Mr. Perales said that the current influx of undocumented aliens in the Plattsburgh and Buffalo regions showed that ''the upheavals'' resulting from the new law have already started and the task force should continue its mission. Many of the aliens have been stopped while trying to enter Canada to avoid deportation under the new law.</p>
        <p>The task force will hold a public hearing at the New York City Bar Association on April 2 to enable employers, unions, voluntary agencies and the public to express their views about the new law. The views expressed will be forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington.</p>
        <p>After noting measures already taken to inform the public and state agencies about the provisions of the Immigration Act, the task force's report also recommends that the state continue to advise and monitor the Federal Government on the carrying out of the new laws, and coordinate efforts by state and local agencies and Federal officials.</p>
        <p>The report also includes plans made by several state agencies to oversee the law. The Department of Education has drafted a program to assist local educational agencies to provide services to eligible aliens and those seeking temporary residence.</p>
        <p>The Division of Human Rights, the report says, has presented a plan to create the procedures and mechanisms to monitor Immigration Act-related discrimination complaints.</p>
        <p>The Department of Social Services will have primary responsibility for administering cash, medical and social service benefits to newly legalized aliens, according to the report. It suggested that additional funds would be necessary.</p>
        <p>Immigration specialists on an advisory committee to the task force reacted favorably to the report.</p>
        <p>''It's critically important that the state play a leading role in the legalization process,'' said an advisory committee member, Phil Boneta, staff attorney for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>He emphasized the need for state agencies to make it easier for eligible aliens to obtain documentation for legalization.</p>
