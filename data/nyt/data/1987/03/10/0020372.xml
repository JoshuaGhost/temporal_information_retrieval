        <p>LEAD: PLUNGING toward the impossible, scientists on three continents are racing to achieve one of the great dreams of science - an everyday material that carries electricity without the slightest loss of energy.</p>
        <p>PLUNGING toward the impossible, scientists on three continents are racing to achieve one of the great dreams of science - an everyday material that carries electricity without the slightest loss of energy.</p>
        <p>Until now, such materials, superconductors, have existed only in the esoteric reaches of low-temperature physics, a few degrees above absolute zero. But a series of new announcements over the last week around the United States have suddenly raised the prospect of a superconductor that could work at room temperature.</p>
        <p>In magnets, wires or electronic devices, a room-temperature superconductor would hold the power to transform technology on a scale unseen since the advent of the transistor. As a result, the pace of discovery has accelerated to a feverish level at the major research laboratories of the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>''There's never been anything like this,'' said Alex Zettl of the University of California at Berkeley, one of many physicists announcing milestones. ''People are working full steam, every day everyone is calling all the other groups, and because of that things are advancing even faster. It's an absolute avalanche.''</p>
        <p>Some applications are already in sight - from smaller, faster computers to storage of electricity in huge magnetic coils. Even when they speak of high-speed trains levitated by magnets or electric motors shrunk to one-tenth normal size, many scientists believe they have barely begun to imagine the most far-reaching uses of a room-temperature superconductor.</p>
        <p>Because existing superconductors require extreme cold, their usefulness has been limited to applications that justify the expense. But the newly discovered class of materials make the critical transition to superconductivity at higher and higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, the barrier seemed to be 23 kelvins, or degrees centigrade above absolute zero. Recently scientists broke through to levels of 30, 39 and then 52 under artificially high pressure.</p>
        <p>Then - amid a flurry of patent applications and public announcements aimed at establishing scientific priority - scientists found a material that starts the transition to superconductivity at an astounding 98 kelvins. The last few days have brought a rapid sequence of new developments:</p>
        <p>* Yet another compound displayed fluctuations indicating possible superconductivity at about 240 kelvins, less than 40 degrees below zero, according to separate groups at the University of Houston and the University of California at Berkeley. Room temperature is about 295 kelvins.</p>
        <p>* A radical new theory of the physics of superconductivity was put forward by a Nobel laureate who had earlier estimated the theoretical upper limit at about 100 kelvins; his new theory finds no obstacle to superconductivity at room temperature.</p>
        <p>* On the basis of only sketchy public information about the latest discoveries, laboratories around the nation succeeded independently in duplicating the compounds with transitions above 90 kelvins, confirming that the materials were true superconductors and producing the first pure samples.</p>
        <p>''These materials are so easy to make that as soon as a result comes out it's reproduced in many places simultaneously,'' said Robert Dynes of A.T.&amp;T. Bell Laboratories. ''What's a record today is not going to be a record tomorrow. It's like finding a gold mine where the nuggets are out there staring at you - you don't need sophisticated equipment to find them.'' A Breakthrough In Zurich It took nine months for news to begin spreading to the many theorists and experimentalists specializing in superconductivity in government, industrial and university laboratories around the world, but the barrier to high-temperature superconductivity fell forever on Jan. 27, 1986.</p>
        <p>The breakthrough came in an unexpected kind of material - a small, dark chunk of ceramic, an oxide instead of a metal alloy. Ordinarily, oxides are insulators, especially poor conductors of electricity, and most researchers in superconductivity were looking elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But two scientists at the I.B.M. Zurich Research Laboratory in Switzerland, K. Alex Muller and J. Georg Bednorz, thought oxides were promising. For three years they had been mixing powders, baking them in hot ovens to make new compounds and chilling them to see if they would lose their resistance to electricity.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bednorz read in a French journal about a particular new oxide, combining barium with lanthanum, copper and oxygen. The French scientists who discovered the compound were primarily chemists, and they never tested it for superconductivity.</p>
        <p>No one else saw the promise and acted on it. ''That's the amazing thing,'' said Richard Greene of I.B.M's Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ''Anybody in the field of superconductivity should have been aware of this French work and should have measured these materials. So we're all kicking ourselves in the butt. In a way, it's the problem of modern science: There's so much work going on in so many places that it's impossible to keep up with it all.''</p>
        <p>But the Zurich scientists suspected that the material might be just what they had been seeking. And on Jan. 27, they discovered that electrical resistance plummeted at about 30 kelvins. After three years, they felt as much relief as triumph. ''Each time I had set up the apparatus, I was expecting that something very exciting would happen,'' Dr. Bednorz said in an interview from Zurich. ''But nothing happened - until this time.''</p>
        <p>Even then, they could not be sure they were seeing true superconductivity, a strange state of matter in which electrons flow freely through the crystalline lattice of molecules. The annals of materials research are filled with false reports of odd phenomena that looked like high-temperature superconductivity but could not be reproduced.</p>
        <p>Because of their uncertainty, and because they were concerned about competition, Dr. Muller and Dr. Bednorz kept their discovery quiet. In April they submitted a tentative report to a German journal, Zeitschrift fur Physik, but publication took five months, and in the meantime they did not share prepublication copies with their colleagues, even at I.B.M.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to measure as much as possible without being pressed by competitors,'' Dr. Bednorz said. The Global Race Begins in Earnest Researchers who read the Zurich results after they appeared in September took two paths. They tried to reproduce the results, making the same material and looking for explanations of its unexpected properties. And they tried to change the recipe, hoping to find variations that would work at even higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>By December, the competition was intensifying. Groups in China and Japan saw the challenge. At the University of Houston, C. W. Chu had already worked on oxides and studied the ability of high pressures to encourage superconductivity.</p>
        <p>So he squeezed the new material with thousands of times the pressure of the atmosphere. When he measured the temperature at which the transition to superconductivity began, he found that he was able to achieve first 40 kelvins, then 50 and then almost 60.</p>
        <p>In the last week of December, his group and a group at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey simultaneously made the first public announcements of the breakthrough that had begun in Zurich.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Chu, the pressure technique had reached its limit. ''When we went further, it wouldn't go,'' he said. ''So we tried to mimic the pressure by chemical methods.'' That meant understanding something about the crystalline structure of the oxides. Dr. Chu tried replacing barium with strontium, a smaller atom. Immediately the transition temperature rose. But when he tried an even smaller atom, calcium, the temperature fell again.</p>
        <p>Another piece of the puzzle fell into place when he realized that the purity of his samples had an odd effect. Usually a given pebble of a substance would not be homogeneous but would contain different phases, or chemical structures; and as Dr. Chu made his samples purer in January, they stopped showing signs of superconductivity at the very highest temperatures. That hint led him to a new material altogether, in which the lanthanum was replaced by yttrium.</p>
        <p>This material, still containing several different phases in any one sample, produced signs of an inconceivably high transition temperature. The signs came and went, but on Jan. 8, Dr. Chu submitted a patent application. Three weeks ago, his group and a group at the University of Alabama led by Maw-Kuen Wu, a former student of his, announced that they had achieved the transition to superconductivity at more than 90 kelvins.</p>
        <p>They did not mention yttrium, though. For the moment, other researchers had to guess. From Experiment To Theory As researchers search frantically for better and better compounds, some of the crucial properties of those already discovered are just now beginning to come into focus. Even Dr. Chu had not been able to make a 100 percent pure version, but on Friday, for the first time, A.T.&amp;T. Bell Laboratories reported that it had isolated and purified the high-temperature superconductor.</p>
        <p>For power transmission, a superconductor must be capable of carrying large currents. That has been a serious question about the new materials, but the Bell group - Robert J. Cava and his colleagues - said the problem seems manageable.</p>
        <p>For magnet applications, the key question is how big a field the material can sustain without losing superconductivity. Researchers report that the new substances seem able to handle enormous fields compared with the materials now in use.</p>
        <p>But much remains to be learned, and many physicists believe that the best guide to new breakthroughs would be a sound theory.</p>
        <p>Since its discovery in 1911, the phenomenon of superconductivity has been tinged with mystery. The first successful theoretical explanation waited until 1957. Unfortunately, it does not seem to explain the new materials. ''It's one of the greatest achievements of theoretical physics,'' said Dr. Zettl, ''but right now the experimentalists are way ahead of the theory.''</p>
        <p>The first attempt to turn the latest breakthoughs into radically new ideas about physics was published last week in Science by Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University. He sees a key in the fact that the new materials are flirting with being insulators; with the slightest change in composition, they would carry no electricity at all.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anderson suggests a basic mechanism of repulsion between electrons, rather than attraction as in traditional superconductivity. He envisions ''a state in which there is no long-range order, no regular structure, very much like a fluid.''</p>
        <p>At this stage, the theory is sketchy, he said, but it has enabled him to make some guesses about where the experimentalists should turn. ''I have a list hidden away, and I've talked to various people about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even without a complete theory, physicists have been able to make good guesses about new materials. Last week, before the secret of Dr. Chu's material was revealed, the University of California at Berkeley duplicated it, as did several other laboratories. And Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island achieved a transition at 90 kelvins with a different substitution, using lutetium rather than yttrium.</p>
        <p>The patent implications alone may take years to sort out. Not only have various researchers applied for patents on each new material, but I.B.M. and Bell Laboratories are both trying to patent the entire class.</p>
        <p>''If you could go down to the corner hardware store and say you want wire,'' said Marvin Cohen, a Berkeley physicist, ''and if they would say, 'What kind do you want, normal or superconducting?' that would certainly change the world.'' AN IRRESISTIBLE FUTURE</p>
        <p>''Let's just dream a little,'' said Praveen Chaudhari, director of physical sciences at I.B.M.'s Watson Research Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.</p>
        <p>If a superconductor can be found that requires no cooling, and if it can be readily made into wires or films, Dr. Chaudhari and other physicists see few limits on its potential for improving the technologies of scientific research and everyday life.</p>
        <p>''Levitating trains are simple, transmission lines are simple, replacing wherever you need magnetic fields with superconducting fields,'' he said. ''If you wanted to dream further, you could see the day when instead of cars with wheels you have levitating cars.''</p>
        <p>Already, superconductors are used in the most advanced medical imaging machines and in research on generating electricity by nuclear fusion, where magnets are essential to confine the reaction. For fusion some physicists now suggest that the far more powerful magnets promised by the new materials may make the difference between failure and success.</p>
        <p>No one can predict the economic implications. A recent Federal study estimated that superconductivity would be at least a $3 billion a year business within the next three years, and at least an $11 billion business by the year 2000. Those estimates have now become obsolete.</p>
        <p>A vast share of the world's electricity is lost to resistance in transmission lines. If an everyday superconductor could be manufactured on a large enough scale, those losses could be eliminated, and new nuclear power plants or arrays of solar cells could be placed far from where people use the energy.</p>
        <p>For some physicists, the touchiest application concerns particle accelerators. The proposed Superconducting Supercollider, approved in January by President Reagan, would use gigantic superconducting magnets along its 60-mile circumference.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the accelerator are concerned that the project could be delayed by the prospect of magnets that might be far less expensive but might also be years in development.</p>
        <p>Even short of room temperature, the superconductors already discovered will transform electrical technology from motors to generators, and they raise the possibility of storing vast amounts of energy in magnetic coils.</p>
        <p>The new superconductors do not require the elaborate technology of cooling by liquid helium. Liquid nitrogen is enough, and liquid nitrogen, scientists suddenly like to point out, is cheaper than milk.</p>
        <p>''It's already an amazing discovery,'' said Alex Zettl of the University of California at Berkeley. ''A year ago it was totally out of the question. Every theorist would have laughed. It was just science fiction.''</p>
