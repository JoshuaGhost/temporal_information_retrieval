        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of Hermann Broch's novel ''The Spell'' (Jan. 25), Erich Heller faults Broch on several accounts.</p>
        <p>Since Broch was not satisfied with the novel, Mr. Heller suggests ''it cannot be regarded as a work its author would have allowed in print.'' Yet how many works of literary eminence would be lost forever, if an author's evaluation of his own work or his desire not to see it published were the determining factors? (The most blatant example is, of course, Franz Kafka.) Does Broch's much-professed ''aversion to literature'' automatically condemn the work in which he makes a theme of the question of literature's relevance in ''dire times'' (as Holderlin had stated it over a century before Broch and as Adorno was to ask it after Auschwitz)? Broch wrote ''The Spell'' in 1936 and ''The Death of Virgil'' from 1938 to 1945, when the utter insignificance of literature as a deterrent to political cataclysms was most painfully obvious. We may agree that Broch demanded too much when he pitted literature against fascism, and his ultimate discontent with any of his novels stems from his unrealistically high - and, from a literary point of view, extraneous - expectations. But rather than invalidate his attempts, these novels stand as glorious examples in the modern tradition that builds on the recognition of its inherently paradoxical existence.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, Mr. Heller feels that the characters in ''The Spell'' do not accurately convey their historical models. But ''The Spell'' is not, strictly speaking, a historical novel. Rather, it is a study in the contagious diseases of prejudice and mass hysteria, in intellectual and moral cowardice and in the attempts to belittle, to whitewash and to ignore. That is the historical reality of 1936, and this he describes as he observes neighboring Germany and his own Austria.  ERNESTINE SCHLANT  Upper Montclair, N.J.</p>
