        <p>LEAD: Believed to be the oldest Christian monastery in uninterrupted existence, it is the only Christian religious edifice with a mosque within its walls and possibly the sole Christian shrine granted protection and freedom from taxation in a letter from the Prophet Mohammed.

        <p>Believed to be the oldest Christian monastery in uninterrupted existence, it is the only Christian religious edifice with a mosque within its walls and possibly the sole Christian shrine granted protection and freedom from taxation in a letter from the Prophet Mohammed. The monastery is St. Catherine's, a massive fort-like structure created by the Roman Emperor Justinian at the foot of the traditional site of Mt. Sinai 1,456 years ago.</p>
        <p>It is a powerful building, measuring 93 yards by 83 yards, with brown stone walls about 5 feet 6 inches thick and from 39 to 49 feet in height.</p>
        <p>It is dominated by a tower rising above its central place of worship, the Church of the Transfiguration. The monks are awakened each day by 33 strokes of its bell (for the 33 years of Jesus' life).</p>
        <p>Despite the height and solidity of the architecture, which has enabled it to survive so many centuries, it is still dwarfed by the landscape in which it is set at the foot of Mt. Moses, called Jebel Musa by the Arabs and known too by its Old Testament name of Mt. Sinai. The mountain towers 7,500 feet above the plateau at almost a mile above sea level in Wadi Shuba. It is surrounded by other peaks all thrust out of great tan igneous scarps in what the book of Exodus calls ''the back side of the desert.''</p>
        <p>The monastery enshrines many of the most famous religious legends: the Burning Bush in which God appeared to Moses and commanded him to lead the Jews to the Promised Land; the harsh peak atop Sinai where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments (or the Tablets of the Law); the cavity where the Golden Calf was cast by skeptics; the Stone of Moses where the prophet struck a rock with his rod and drew water; the modest mountaintop chapel where according to tradition St. Catherine's body lay for between three and five centuries after she was martyred in Alexandria and transported by angels to Mt. Sinai. St. Catherine, according to the tradition, was tortured on what became known as a Catherine's wheel and later beheaded.</p>
        <p>This beautiful yet forbidding complex is included in an area that is sacred to the Arabs and known to them as Deir Sant Katerin. It was a holy and legendary region before the monastery was built in A.D. 527, having been venerated by Christian Arabs in the area for many decades, long before Mohammed and the creation of Islam.</p>
        <p>It is known that hundreds of early Christian hermits who had journeyed to Sinai and remained there in awe of its holy reputation sent a delegation to Justinian in Constantinople and he sent architects, builders and slaves to build the monastery.</p>
        <p>St. Catherine's still attracts biblical scholars and devout pilgrims but today it is mostly visited by tourists. Hundreds visit the monastery each year as a result of the Egyptian Government's efforts to attract tourists to one of its major post-Pharaonic sites. In 1984 President Hosni Mubarak paid a visit to a ''tourist village'' a mile or so from the monastery and opened a cluster of new stone bungalows.</p>
        <p>One serves as a reception center, one as a restaurant and some five dozen others as sturdy visitors' dwellings comprising a bedroom, sitting room and bath, all with electricity and shaky air-conditioning. Hitchhikers, backpackers and young travelers are made welcome, on approval, at a monastery ''hostel'' within its own limits.</p>
        <p>I arrived on a bitterly cold winter morning when few tourists were present or expected; there was no organization, no guides, nor any attempt to help the visitor. But after leaving my minimal baggage in one of the many unoccupied bungalows I walked for about 30 minutes along a hostile desert road beneath fierce mountains and found my way to the the entrance door set in the monastery wall.</p>
        <p>Inside I heard a voice and found a monk (named, I learned, Father Gregorios) dressed in a black robe and monk's hat, lecturing in moderately good English to a small group of tourists from different lands. We were all in the Church of the Transfiguration, a sizable structure with high ceiling from which dozens of oil lamps hung on chains. Incense drifted through the apse; a red carpet and many lovely icons were hanging along the walls. A particularly fine mosaic of the Transfiguration curves above the gilt altar and crimson banners hang beneath tapers on the sides of the apse. Outside, in the hallways, many ancient manuscripts are displayed inside glass cases.</p>
        <p>Father Gregorios explained that the mosaic was created in the early sixth century just after the monastery and church were built. He led the group outside by the well of Moses, where by tradition the patriarch first met his bride, Zipporah, daughter of Jethro. Farther along, within the walls, was the small mosque and minaret erected for the monks' Bedouin neighbors and Moslem cooks and servants. Beneath this is an olive press. Farther along there is a narrow orchard of citrus, almond, fig and apricot trees and, just beyond the orchard, a large, spreading green shrub described by Gregorios as ''a kind of blackberry,'' which he said was the deathless Burning Bush. I twisted a twig off it. No berries, plenty of thorns.</p>
        <p>At this point Father Giorgos, a Greek from Salonika, took over in fluent English. He said that the monastery was self-sufficient. He said it grew its own fruit and vegetables, had access to some wheat in adjacent land, and collected ample water in cisterns during the rainy season. As he talked the sun shone down beside the Burning Bush and above us towered Mt. Moses. At this point I edged away from the party of visitors and went in search of Father Makarios, an American monk. Father Makarios took me to a low wall outside the entrance, where we sat in the cold winter sunshine.</p>
        <p>Father Makarios is from Bingham Canyon, Utah. His name at birth was Michael Mannos; his father, also born in America, had worked in the Bingham Canyon copper mine and his grandfather, now 97 and still healthy, had emigrated from the Greek island of Kea. Father Makarios, 42, is a strongly built man of medium height with black hair, beard, and spectacles, which he hangs around his neck on a cord. He was educated at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and also at Westminster College, a Presbyterian institution. Finally he studied at the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox theological seminary in Brookline, Mass. Despite his ancestry, he knew very little Greek before he came to St. Catherine's. The monks all speak Greek, although novices are welcome from Russian, Serbian and other Orthodox congregations.</p>
        <p>As the time neared 1 o'clock I excused myself so that my host could have his lunch and we made another appointment, for 5 o'clock after prayers. When I returned I found Father Makarios awaiting me just inside the entrance. He took me to a room for further conversation with himself and, for a time, with my host acting as interpreter, with Father Dimitrios, the librarian, who speaks only Greek.</p>
        <p>Together the two monks told me of the discovery and loss of the Codex Sinaitica, a fifth-century Greek manuscript of the Tablets of the Law, received atop Mt. Sinai by Moses. (Codex means book and derives from the Greek codicos.) Father Giorgios had already told me that between 1844 and 1854 a scholar from Leipzig found the manuscript of the Codex at the monastery and ''borrowed it permanently.'' Constantine Tischendorf, the German, took the treasure home and kept it in his Leipzig house although he had promised to return it to St. Catherine's. Finally he gave it to Czar Alexander II of Russia, who had paid for his Sinai trip.</p>
        <p>In 1933, long after the Communists had inherited the Codex and Russia's other treasures, the British Musuem bought the manuscript from the Soviet Government for one hundred thousand pounds (then half a million dollars). At that time Porphyrios III was abbot of the monastery and when he learned of the British purchase he sought to regain the treasure. According to Father Makarios a wealthy Alexandrian Greek named Cotsikas offered to provide the money but the museum refused to yield its claim. Father Dimitrios said there were no current efforts to buy back the manuscript, but he added that 24 inscribed sheets of the original text were discovered after a monastery fire in 1975 and were now in his library.</p>
        <p>The library was closed for repairs at the time of my visit and I could not see its famous collection of books and manuscripts in a variety of languages, including Hebrew, Greek, Syriac, Turkish and Arabic.</p>
        <p>After the librarian left, Father Makarios told me more about the monastery's origins and its daily life. He said the events of the 40-year journey of the Jews across Sinai to the Promised Land, as described in the Old Testament, are estimated to have taken place in 1260 B.C. However, the Old Testament books were not written until almost 500 years later. The Bedouin tribes living in the area handed down traditional accounts, generation after generation, and in the third century A.D. hermits near Mt. Sinai studied the original texts recounting Bedouin tales that were ultimately compiled in the Old Testament.</p>
        <p>Father Makarios said the monks had always been hospitable toward later Moslem visitors, honoring the protection given them by Mohammed's letter, which was taken away in 1517 by the Turkish Sultan Selim I and is now in the Topkapi Museum in Instanbul.</p>
        <p>The mosque is a token of the mutual religious tolerance surrounding St. Catherine's. The key to the Moslem edifice is kept by the monastery. Father Makarios said, ''This is the only Islamic mosque in the world inside a Christian holy place.'' It is still used by the monks' Moslem servants.</p>
        <p>He said there are now only 20 monks at the monastery; there used to be hundreds. He added that there are also ''a few'' novices who, if they survive the difficult novitiate period, are admitted by monks at the behest of the abbot.</p>
        <p>The monastic life is stern. There are three fast days a week when the monks eat only vegetables boiled without olive oil. No tobacco (or firearms) are permitted. But they can drink alcoholic beverages and are served wine on feast days, when they can also eat fish, dairy products and eggs (never animal or bird flesh).</p>
        <p>At 4 A.M. they wake up and pray in their cells until 8. From 8 to 9 is a rest period, which ends with each monk doing the task assigned to him, which might include working in the library, digging in the garden or cleaning icons. Lunch (the day's first nourishment) is served about 1 P.M. and all monks eat together in silence while a novice reads aloud from a religious text. From 1:30 P.M. until 3 is a rest period; vespers are held until 5, when the monks return to their cells. At 10 P.M. lights are turned out but the monks are permitted to read in their cells by lamplight or candles.</p>
        <p>Two events in St. Catherine's history have been proclaimed as miracles. Once, according to the monks, there was no food left and they were gathered together by the abbot to celebrate the Eucharist and then leave. On their way up the mountain, the tradition goes, an apparition of the Virgin Mary appeared. She asked the abbot where they were going, and, when he explained, told him to return to the monastery, where he would find a caravan of food at the gate. And, according to tradition, so it happened. The second event seen as a miracle came when the monastery ran out of olive oil, which is needed for food and lamps. When the monks prayed they saw that the empty oil containers were overflowing from the storage room and that oil was coursing through the building to the Church of the Transfiguration.</p>
        <p>Father Makarios said St. Catherine's is called ''the oldest continuous and active Christian monastery.'' Its best-known saint is John Klimakos, a hermit who became abbot in the seventh century. The Crusaders founded an Order of St. Catherine's and Catherine the Great of Russia as well as Queen Isabella of Spain sent precious gifts.</p>
        <p>When I left Father Makarios he took me to the bakery where Bedouin cooks had made excellent hot rolls. As I said farewell, then fumbled along the road in the savage chill to the tourist village, there was no moon visible and few stars. The food in the restaurant was served cold and the tourist bungalow was freezing. I slept fully dressed with the blankets of both beds over me. At 6 A.M. I caught a bus to Port Suez, changing there for a bus to Cairo.</p>
        <p>The desert, with its occasional oases, its goats and camels, its sharp rocks and cliffs, had inspired more respect than affection.
