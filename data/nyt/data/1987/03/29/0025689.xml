        <p>THE revival of the harpsichord early in this century, by Wanda Landowska and others, was naturally most important for the performance of 18th-century music. But a fascinating side effect was the cultivation of new repertory for the instrument. This is not a tendency that petered out as French neo-Classicism ebbed. It has continued well into our own time, with contributions by composers of most every stylistic stripe.</p>
        <p>Thursday night, a quite remarkable harpsichordist named Joyce Lindorff offered a survey of harpsichord music composed between 1960 and 1986. The concert was presented by the League of Composers and the New York section of the International Society for Contemporary Music, and took place at Merkin Concert Hall.</p>
        <p>Trained at Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Southern California and the Juilliard School, and now based in New York, Ms. Lindorff was introduced to 20th-century harpsichord repertory by Leonard Stein of the Schoenberg Institute in Los Angeles. Since then she has never looked back, and several notable composers have written pieces for her.</p>
        <p>Five of her six pieces Thursday were for solo harpsichord; the exception was the New York premiere of ''Aubade in Spring'' (1986) by Noyes Bartholomew, which enlisted a mixed quartet (Sue Ann Kahn, flutist; Ryan Brown, violinist; Dennis Smylie, clarinetist, and Michael Finckel, cellist) and sounded like a harmonically tart homage to the very French new-music world in which Landowska herself flourished.</p>
        <p>The recital began with the solo version of Henry Cowell's ''Set of Four,'' a late work (1960) but still full of vanguard spunk. Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''Fantasy' (1983) seemed most interesting for its two-manual color contrasts (Ms. Lindorff's instrument was made by Eric Herz).</p>
        <p>Eric Ewazen's Sonata (the world premiere of a piece composed in 1980) proved thoughtful, virtuosically challenging and compelling for the way the harpsichord softened the impact of its sometimes intense chromaticism. And Hans Werner Henze's ''Lucy Escott Variations'' (1963), a more self-consciously avant-garde effort than much of his later work, made witty and colorful comment on an aria from Bellini's ''Sonnambula.''</p>
        <p>But the concert's climax came with William Albright's ''Four Fancies'' (1979), in its first three movements a neatly crafted tribute to the Baroque that ends up with a driving ''Danza ostinato'' that sounded like a hyper-virtuosic evocation of both jazz and Terry Riley. It was brilliant music, brilliantly played, capping one of the most appealing recitals of the season.</p>
