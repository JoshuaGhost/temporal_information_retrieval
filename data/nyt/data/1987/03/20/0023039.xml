        <p>LEAD: When two dozen women met recently in a Manhattan apartment to discuss the Baby M trial, they quickly found one issue on which they could agree. None would want her skills as a mother put to the scrutiny that Mary Beth Whitehead was being subjected to in a Hackensack, N.J., courtroom.</p>
        <p>When two dozen women met recently in a Manhattan apartment to discuss the Baby M trial, they quickly found one issue on which they could agree. None would want her skills as a mother put to the scrutiny that Mary Beth Whitehead was being subjected to in a Hackensack, N.J., courtroom.</p>
        <p>One mental-health expert had said Mrs. Whitehead, fighting for custody of Baby M after bearing her under a surrogate-mother agreement, was ''almost myopic in her view that her role as the biological mother enables her to understand her children better than anyone else.'' A second expert had said Mrs. Whitehead had from a ''narcissistic personality disorder,'' in part because she tinted her hair. He also criticized how she played patty-cake with the baby and her choice of toys -stuffed pandas instead of pots and pans.</p>
        <p>''A lot of us felt that by these standards you could say that we're all unfit mothers,'' said Lois Gould, a novelist at whose apartment the meeting was held. ''We could all have our children taken away.''</p>
        <p>A result of the meeting, and of the growing opinion among feminists that Mrs. Whitehead was being held to an unfair standard of motherhood, was a simple declaration of solidarity with her: ''By these standards we are all unfit mothers.''</p>
        <p>The statement, released the last day of the testimony, was signed by more than 100 prominent women, including Betty Friedan, the early feminist; Meryl Streep, the actress; Carly Simon, the singer, and the writers Nora Ephron and Gloria Steinem.</p>
        <p>Besides breaking a silence by many feminists on the tangled ethical issues raised by the Baby M case, the statement reflected a shift in public attitudes toward the custody battle between Mrs. Whitehead and William and Elizabeth Stern, the childless professional couple who had agreed to pay Mrs. Whitehead $10,000 to be artificially inseminated with Mr. Stern's sperm. From an initial negative perception of Mrs. Whitehead as a woman who had entered into a contract to have a baby for money and then reneged, she began to be seen as a victim, exploited by people better off than she and subjected to unfair scrutiny of her family life and personality.</p>
        <p>''The point of this letter should, we hope, have some shock value to the rest of the country,'' said Dr. Phyllis Chesler, writer of ''Mothers and Divorce'' and a signer of the statement. ''So that if Mary Beth Whitehead is seen as unfit by the country, then let the country see that Meryl Streep is unfit. And if we realize that Meryl Streep is not unfit, then let people rethink why they thought Mary Beth was unfit.''</p>
        <p>The statement ends, ''We strongly urge the legislators and jurists who will deal with these matters to recognize that a mother need not be perfect to deserve her child.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gould said the signers - 124 so far - were united on two issues. The first was that the attacks, by lawyers for the Sterns and by expert witnesses, on Mrs. Whitehead's history, finances and brief time as a barroom dancer, struck many as containing a class bias, as well as being reminiscent of rape defenses based on impeaching the victim. The women also agreed that the commercialization of surrogate motherhood - with intermediaries receiving fees of $10,000 or more for arranging contracts - was wrong.</p>
        <p>Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist and writer of ''The Tentative Pregnancy,'' said although feminists might debate whether women should sell their services as prostitutes or as surrogate mothers, ''there is agreement in the feminist community about pimps.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Katz Rothman said, ''There is virtual unanimity on the inappropriateness of other people selling our bodies.'' She called the men and women who arranged surrogacies ''the pimps'' of the surrogacy movement.</p>
        <p>Some of the signers of the statement were uncomfortable with its implication that the psychology and biology of motherhood made Mrs. Whitehead's claim to Baby M stronger than Mr. Stern's, because a tenet of feminism has long been that differences in reproductive functions should not be a basis for separate treatment of men and women.</p>
