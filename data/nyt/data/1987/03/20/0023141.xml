        <p>LEAD: A man wrested a gun from a police officer and took several people hostage yesterday afternoon in a Brick Township, N.J., furniture store, where he killed a salesman and wounded a former girlfriend before shooting himself to death, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A man wrested a gun from a police officer and took several people hostage yesterday afternoon in a Brick Township, N.J., furniture store, where he killed a salesman and wounded a former girlfriend before shooting himself to death, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The gunman was identified as Luis Rosa, 31 years old, of Brick.</p>
        <p>Shortly before 2 P.M., he approached Officer William Bonham, 37, who was in his Brick Township patrol car on Chambers Bridge Road, and asked for directions, according to the police. Mr. Rosa pulled a bayonet from his clothing and placed it against the officer's throat, according to the police.</p>
        <p>Officer Bonham grabbed the bayonet, cutting his right hand, and pulled Mr. Rosa partly through the open window. During the scuffle, Mr. Rosa managed to grab the officer's gun, a .357 Magnum, and forced him from the car, according to the police. Call on Telephone</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosa drove the car about a mile and a half to the Dee Rose Furniture Store on Brick Boulevard, where he took several hostages, including his former girlfriend, Mary Ann Markey, of Brick, the report said. He fatally shot a hostage, John Brinker, a salesman of Forked River, twice in the chest, and wounded Miss Markey in the abdomen and right arm.</p>
        <p>The police emergency team called the gunman on a store telephone. While the police were arranging for his surrender and the release of the remaining hostages, Mr. Rosa fatally shot himself in the chest, the police said.</p>
        <p>Miss Markey was taken to Brick Township Hospital, where she was in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery. Officer Bonham was treated at the hospital and released. Rosa Had Been Arrested</p>
        <p>Detective Inspector Joseph Perna said Mr. Rosa was arrested for trespassing last Saturday night on Mantoloking Road, around the corner from Miss Markey's home. He said Mr. Rosa might have been under the misapprehension that Mr. Brinker was dating Miss Markey.</p>
        <p>The negotiations for the hostages lasted 90 minutes, according to Sgt. Gary Wood of the emergency team. He said Mr. Rosa was very excitable and emotional and expressed great fear that he would be harmed by the police.</p>
        <p>The incident ended at 3:30 P.M., when Mr. Rosa shot himself. He was declared dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>About 10 other people, most of them employees, were in the store when Mr. Rosa entered. He took them to a small office in the store. Some were able to escape when the police smashed a rear glass door with an ax.</p>
