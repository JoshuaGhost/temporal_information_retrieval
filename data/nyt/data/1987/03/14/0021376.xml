        <p>LEAD: Ronald J. Moss resigned yesterday as State Commerce Commissioner, and Governor Cuomo indicated that he might name Vincent Tese, the State Director of Economic Development, to take over the job in addition to his other duties.</p>
        <p>Ronald J. Moss resigned yesterday as State Commerce Commissioner, and Governor Cuomo indicated that he might name Vincent Tese, the State Director of Economic Development, to take over the job in addition to his other duties.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt he could do the job,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I haven't decided to ask him yet.''</p>
        <p>In addition to being Director of Economic Development, Mr. Tese heads the State Urban Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss, a former advertising executive, indicated in January that he would be leaving the $79,200-a-year job he had held since May 1985. His decision followed Mr. Cuomo's announcement that he wanted to shift most of the Commerce Department's economic development functions to the U.D.C.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss has not spoken publicly about his reasons for leaving and did not offer any in his short resignation letter to Cuomo.</p>
