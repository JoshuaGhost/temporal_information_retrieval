        <p>What President Reagan once said in defense of his former deputy chief of staff wholly missed the point. Michael Deaver, he said, ''never put the arm on me, or sought anything or any influence from me since he has been out of government.'' What Mr. Deaver did, with unseemly haste after leaving the White House in 1985, was to put the arm on the rest of the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>Exploiting his famed friendship with the Reagans, he coerced and cajoled officials to make decisions sought by private clients, and collected astronomical profits. When that conduct came under suspicion as illegal, he lied about it to a Congressional subcommittee and even to a grand jury. So says a jury in Washington. His behavior seemed shameless when emblazoned on magazine covers. What he said, the jury found, was also criminal.</p>
        <p>This perjury verdict is the latest stain on the record of an Administration that has always seemed to lack a moral compass. Attorney General Edwin Meese rarely has a day free of investigators examining his conduct. Thanks to the 1978 independent counsel statute, which Congress has wisely renewed and Mr. Reagan has grudgingly signed, the verdict has a sobering message: Even those closest to power can be brought to justice.</p>
        <p>It's hard to believe that Mr. Deaver could have been credibly prosecuted by Mr. Meese's Justice Department. Even the perjury indictment would have been suspect if it had come from Mr. Meese, because it stopped short of charging actual violations of Federal lobbying laws. Whitney North Seymour Jr., the court-appointed independent counsel, now explains that he found the Ethics in Government Act so full of ''loopholes and exemptions'' that it deceives the public into feeling protected from abuse.</p>
        <p>He promises to expose those loopholes and to lobby for closing them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour, a Republican and former U.S. Attorney, has other things to say now that the trial is over:</p>
        <p>''There's too much loose money and too little concern in Washington about ethics in government . . . Until the attitudes of government leaders change, there is little that prosecutors can do except put a thumb in the dike.''</p>
        <p>Yes, but even that is better than the thumb that this Administration, ethically obtuse, keeps sticking in the public eye.</p>
