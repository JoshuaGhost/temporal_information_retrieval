        <p>LEAD: Governor Cuomo summoned Charles J. Hynes to the State Capitol today to praise his successful prosecution of the Howard Beach case, saying that Mr. Hynes's work proved there was no need to create a new special prosecutor's post for handling race-related cases.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo summoned Charles J. Hynes to the State Capitol today to praise his successful prosecution of the Howard Beach case, saying that Mr. Hynes's work proved there was no need to create a new special prosecutor's post for handling race-related cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes holds the title special prosecutor, but with responsibility for investigating all aspects of the New York City criminal-justice system. Many blacks called on the Governor after the attack in Howard Beach, Queens - and have renewed their call recently - to create another special prosecutor whose sole responsibility would be cases involving potentially racial motives.</p>
        <p>''That is not a sound idea,'' said Mr. Cuomo, who gave the Howard Beach case to Mr. Hynes last January rather than create an entirely new special prosecutor post to handle it. ''I must say, not boastfully but with a kind of relief, the way this worked out is fine. We didn't need a new office, and it's worked out very, very well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo gave the case to Mr. Hynes after the Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci, with some behind-the-scenes pressing by Cuomo aides, publicly called for the naming of a special prosecutor. Mr. Santucci said he was unable to prosecute the case because black witnesses refused to give evidence to him, fearing a cover-up by Queens criminal-justice officials.</p>
        <p>The Governor said that by giving the case to Mr. Hynes, he had been working within the existing criminal-justice system. But to name a new prosecutor who exceeded the authority of district attorneys in all race-related cases, the Governor said, would be ''a permanent preemption of the elected system.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes, in an interview, agreed that there was no need for a special prosecutor to handle race-related cases. He said that in cases involving racial motives, including ones in Dutchess County that have recently drawn attention, he found the district attorneys to be ''committed.'' 'A Crystal Apple'</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo's comments came at a brief ceremony in the Capitol in which he presented Mr. Hynes with a gift, a crystal apple.</p>
        <p>At the ceremony and in interviews, these other points emerged:</p>
        <p>* The Governor said he would consider a call by David N. Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough President, for the establishment of a commission to study race relations in the state.</p>
        <p>* Cuomo aides said the Governor had received recommendations that he consider proposing a law to prohibit jury members from profiting from their jury service, particularly by selling their accounts of jury deliberations. The issue came up because of reports that a friend of the jury leader in the Howard Beach case had offered to sell the juror's story to newspapers.</p>
        <p>* Mr. Hynes reaffirmed that now that the trial was over, he would look into Mr. Santucci's original handling of the case. He will concentrate, he said, on the allegation by a victim in the attack, Cedric Sandiford, that he had been treated by Mr. Santucci's office more as a criminal than as a victim.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo and his aides seemed relieved at the outcome of the trial and could not resist pointing out what they perceived as irony in many black officials' praise of Mr. Hynes today. It was over the strong objection of some black officials, law-enforcement officials said, that the Governor had named Mr. Hynes to handle the case.</p>
        <p>According to the officials, when Mr. Cuomo raised Mr. Hynes's name at a six-hour meeting with black officials and community leaders in January, the blacks accused the prosecutor of being racist. They pointed out that, as a private lawyer, Mr. Hynes had defended two white firemen accused of harassment by a black female firefighter.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cuomo, according to those present, told the black leaders after talking with Mr. Hynes by telephone that it had to be Mr. Hynes or otherwise the prosecutor would be marked forever as a racist.</p>
        <p>''The Governor called back,'' Mr. Hynes said, ''and said: 'You've got the job. Do a good job. Click.' He was acting not only as the Governor, but as my friend.''</p>
