        <p>LEAD: A Vietnamese military officer writing in an army journal has acknowledged that Hanoi's soldiers are waging ''fierce and complicated'' psychological battles in Cambodia.</p>
        <p>A Vietnamese military officer writing in an army journal has acknowledged that Hanoi's soldiers are waging ''fierce and complicated'' psychological battles in Cambodia.</p>
        <p>''The enemy's psychological warfare has intensively poisoned the Cambodian people, cadres and troops,'' Col. Nguyen Huu Dinh wrote in a recent issue of the army journal, Tap Chi Quan Doi Nhan Dan. ''The poison has caused definite harm.''</p>
        <p>Colonel Dinh described what he called a ''sophisticated and insidious'' campaign to undermine the Government and the military by three guerrilla groups.</p>
        <p>The guerrilla groups are the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the army of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Pol Pot faction of the Cambodian Communist movement, the Khmer Rouge.</p>
        <p>Diplomats estimate that Vietnam has about 140,000 soldiers in Cambodia.</p>
        <p>Colonel Dinh's article expresses implicit concern about the weakness of Phnom Penh's forces in the face of nationalist propaganda and subversion, suggesting that they were more vulnerable than either Phnom Penh or Hanoi has been willing to acknowledge. 'Defame Our Country'</p>
        <p>The article asserted that psychological warfare in Cambodia was aimed at splitting the alliance between Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, and particularly the ''militant solidarity'' between the Cambodian and Vietnamese forces.</p>
        <p>The article accused the guerrillas of making ''every effort to conduct slanderous propaganda against Vietnam, to distort facts and defame our country'' by contending that Vietnam wanted to assimilate Cambodia and Laos and plunder Cambodia's resources.</p>
        <p>The article said that the guerrillas were working to subvert local military and police forces loyal to the Phnom Penh government. ''They have used money and gold as bribes to plant their men to work as drivers, logistical personnel, messengers, typists and so forth,'' it said. ''Taking advantage of the negligence of our friends, they have used money to buy identity papers for infiltrating their men into various training schools. They have persuaded the soldiers of our friends to desert their units for home or to defect to the enemy's side.''</p>
