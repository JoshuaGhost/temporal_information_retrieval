        <p>LEAD: ONE of my daughter's teachers ranks it with a tribal initiation rite, a passageway into adulthood. It has also been compared to the great quests of myth and literature: the Holy Grail, the Golden Fleece, the siege of Troy. Sometimes it resembles the dilemma of a rat in a maze.</p>
        <p>ONE of my daughter's teachers ranks it with a tribal initiation rite, a passageway into adulthood. It has also been compared to the great quests of myth and literature: the Holy Grail, the Golden Fleece, the siege of Troy. Sometimes it resembles the dilemma of a rat in a maze.</p>
        <p>I refer, of course, to the process of applying to college. The thing that sets it apart from initiation rites, quests and mazes is parent participation. I don't recall that Jason took his mother with him to help him find the Golden Fleece, and I doubt that rats negotiate the maze armed with their parents' checkbooks.</p>
        <p>But essentially it's a lonely quest, full of soul-searching. In between composing essays on the person who influenced her most and which school activities changed her life and what were the last 10 books she read and why, Kate spends a lot of time trying to decide what she really wants out of life - at least for the next four years. She and her friends argue the merits of College A over University B. Is one too close to home? Is the other too big? Too small? Scratch College C: too full of future yuppies. Ditto University D: too laid back. And what about a safety school?</p>
        <p>At meals, we talk about S.A.T. scores versus extracurricular activities. Kate says she should have joined the Swim Club. I point out that her school doesn't have a Swim Club. ''I should have started one,'' she moans. She arrives home from school breathless, announcing, ''Guess what!'' Hot news: she met someone who knew someone at College F who says that Famous Writer X is going to be teaching there next year. We hash this over at dinner. Thoroughly.</p>
        <p>I heard of a family who offered to pay their teen-ager not to talk about it. We consider this.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the process has a certain fascination. We've become overnight experts on a lot of things. Various core curriculums. What big shot teaches where. Vegetarian co-ops. Junior year abroad. I can tell you which school has the best Russian department and which the worst food, which schools are for party animals and which for grinds.</p>
        <p>I've learned things about Kate that I never knew: for instance, that her organizational skills are formidable, her two-finger typing is deadly accurate, and she possesses a remarkable capacity for retaining statistics about who accepts how many of whom. I've also taught myself to do complex mathematical calculations; one of my conclusions is that after paying the application fees, we're going to look really good for heavy financial aid.</p>
        <p>There are some laughs involved. View books are always good for a chuckle. View books are the glossy come-ons colleges send out, the equivalent of a four-color brochure from a slick company that wants to snag you as an investor. They're all alike, full of color pictures of smiling, ethnically balanced, cute (but not too cute) students engaged in typical college activities, such as peering into microscopes, playing violin in the college orchestra, wearing funny hats at graduation, sitting in picturesque dorm rooms (preferably with fireplaces) talking earnestly with friends.</p>
        <p>They also read, knit and walk chastely hand in hand down tree-lined paths. There are photos of friendly (but not too friendly) professors lecturing in informal settings or chatting with students outside on the lawn. The lawn is perfectly manicured. It's backed up by a picturesque stone fence; in the distance is the usual imposing stone building, often with a clock tower.</p>
        <p>The view book assures us that College G has a long tradition of commitment to excellence, combines the best of town and country, and values diversity in its students above all. Our harsh climate is exaggerated, says University H, and talks about the fun of Winter Carnival. It's not true that we're isolated, claims College J; we're only 50 miles from Palmer Forks.</p>
        <p>Somewhere out there is the perfect school. From time to time, orchestrating her travels between calculus tests and physics labs, Kate hits the road in search of it. The agreement is that we'll let her visit any college within a reasonable distance, the one exception being College M in Ohio, where I took her last spring because I thought it would be fun to drive to Ohio. (Don't laugh. It was.) Kate has a friend at University K. She stayed for a couple of days in September and came home with reports about the food, her friend's friends, the incredible dorms. Classes? Oh, well. She didn't get around to going to classes.</p>
        <p>But as the days dwindle down, she gets more serious - even grim. I drove her to College X last week for an interview. (Old sleeping bag, new sweater.) Kate stayed overnight with students. I put up at a bed-and-breakfast. She went to classes. I went to museums. She ate in the dining hall. I found a Thai restaurant. I had a great time. So did she, in a nervous sort of way.</p>
        <p>She managed to joke about spies who spotted her crossing the street against the light and made a note in her file. Her interviewer kept her for 45 minutes talking about politics: good sign or bad sign?</p>
        <p>I joined her for an information session with an admissions officer who told us, chuckling, that College X got 15,000 applicants last year. The session was full of white-knuckled high school seniors asking intelligent questions about double majors and computer facilities. They frowned and looked serious and confessed that in their free time they played championship chess, read Thucydides in the original and did independent research into the digestive systems of badgers.</p>
        <p>''You sure you want to go here?'' I asked Kate.</p>
        <p>''They're not like this after they get in,'' she assured me.</p>
        <p>When I was her age, things weren't quite so tense. I seem to recall that, as senior year advanced, everyone I knew (with the exception of a couple of air-head cheerleaders who were sure these were the best years of their lives) became obsessed with getting out of high school. Getting out was what we always called it as if we were in jail - which, in a way, we were. You got used to hearing people mutter in the halls and in the cafeteria, through clenched teeth, ''I can't wait to get out of this place.''</p>
        <p>Between mutters, those of us who were going to college talked about where we wanted to go, what we would major in, and whether our parents could afford it, but I don't remember that the issue dominated our lives. Many of us were the first in our families to go to college, and so which college we chose was less important than our going at all. I attended a high school of 200 students. All I knew was that I wanted a large, impersonal university. I applied to three of them, and chose the largest and most impersonal in the biggest city. Piece of cake.</p>
        <p>I was accepted at one of the places Kate is applying to. I rejected it because view books hadn't been invented and they couldn't fool me about the climate.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't seem to bother a lot of people,'' Kate pointed out. ''They can afford to turn down 80 percent of their applicants.''</p>
        <p>''But they accepted me,'' I point out.</p>
        <p>''That was back in the days when they'd probably take anyone.''</p>
        <p>I think she was joking, but there's probably some truth in it. I realize that now, in 1987, the process is more competitive. A college degree has become almost a necessity, and as students get used to the fact that nearly everyone goes to college, they set their sights higher. Schools that used to be known as only for the rich are now full of the poor. (Like the view book, need-blind admissions hadn't been invented when I was a girl.) I doubt that in my day College X got 15,000 applicants. In fact, I knew plenty of people at X, and most of them never would have survived a selection process that involved anything more rigorous than filling out the application neatly.</p>
        <p>Kate suggests, ''Why don't I just skip the whole thing, take the tuition, and live in Paris for the next four years?'' Considering that a year's tuition is probably double the income of the average Parisian, she could probably make out pretty well.</p>
        <p>But alas, she doesn't mean it. Next week I'm driving her to University Z - the one with the killer climate. She'll stay in a dorm and have an interview. I'll stay at a bed-and-breakfast and worry about getting snowed in. We'll go to another information session, hear more alarming statistics and meet more red-eyed high school seniors clutching copies of Thucydides.</p>
        <p>And then we'll go home and talk about it.</p>
