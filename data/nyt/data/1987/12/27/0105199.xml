        <p>Nearly seven years ago, after the Grammy awards were telecast live from Radio City Music Hall, it looked as though the record industry's equivalent of the Oscars might never again be broadcast from New York City. The show, a three-hour CBS special, had lost money in New York and even though the city rivals Los Angeles as a music capital, the expense and logistics of bringing back an event that costs a million dollars an hour to produce, seemed prohibitive.</p>
        <p>But on March 2, after a vigorous campaign mounted by the Mayor's office and the city's business community, the Grammys will return to New York. And if all goes well, New York City will alternate regularly with Los Angeles, which has been the host of the television show all but four years since it began in 1971.</p>
        <p>Surrounding the March 2 ceremonies are three days of events organized by a special 36-member host committee. On the night of the Grammys, a red carpet will extend from Radio City Music Hall to the New York Hilton, the site of a lavish post-awards party.</p>
        <p>On that night, a giant G clef will be painted on the Avenue of the Americas, in front of the Music Hall. And for three days, signs in Times Square will trumpet the event and welcome the 3,500 members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences who will flock into the city from all over the country. Parties are also planned at the Palladium nightclub and at Gracie Mansion. $3 Billion Industry The campaign to make the Grammys a regular biennial event were set in motion five years ago by the Mayor's office.</p>
        <p>''The Grammys mean a lot to the city psychologically because we are the musical capital of the United States,'' said Herb Rickman, who co-ordinates the city's entertainment industry activities. ''Music is a $3 billion a year industry here, with every facet represented, from publishing to recording to artist representation to the manufacture of instruments.''</p>
        <p>''In 1981, the last time the awards were here, Pierre Cossette, the show's executive producer, worked on his own, and afterward announced he was not coming back because it was too expensive,'' Mr. Rickman said. ''I was upset because we were willing and able to work with him every step of the way. It took us five years of hard work and constant lobbying to get him to reconsider.''</p>
        <p>It is not clear how much money the host committee's activities will save Mr. Cossette in production costs. The committee's chief goal is to create a climate of hospitality that will make the academy's members eager to return two years from now. Talent Is in Los Angeles</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Cossette, the cost of bringing the show to New York is about $500,000 to $1 million greater than to produce it in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''The advantage of Los Angeles is the huge local talent pool,'' Mr. Cossette said. ''Of course, New York is a great place to do it, because New York is where the music industry began and it is still the media center of the world. But 90 percent of the talent in the music business is now Los Angeles-based. Airing the show in New York means having to fly 200 people first class from coast to coast and house and furnishing them with accommodations and limousines.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of the Mayor's campaign was the creation of the host committee - the first such committee to be formed since the Democratic Convention - headed by Jonathan Tisch, the president of Loew's Hotels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tisch gathered a group of influential business leaders from companies as diverse as Henri Bendel, F.A.O. Schwarz and American Express and several politicians to persuade Mr. Cossette and his team to change their minds.</p>
        <p>The committee has already raised two-thirds of a $200,000 fund to facilitate services that include free transportation around New York for the talent. Mr. Cossette was won over, and last April, at the Hard Rock Cafe, Mayor Koch announced that the show would return to New York. Grammy in the Schools Program</p>
        <p>Mr. Cossette and his production team were shown several possible locations, including Madison Square Garden and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Even Yankee Stadium was suggested. But in the end Radio City Music Hall was selected. It is the same size - nearly 6,000 seats -as the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, where the show has been staged. And it was the only site available for the two weeks of extensive preproduction preparations.</p>
        <p>Besides the events, the host committee has added a number of inducements to make the academy members' visit more entertaining. Blocks of theater tickets for hit Broadway shows are being made available to the academy's members, and several beauty parlor chains have offered discounts to members.</p>
        <p>The host committee also wants to organize ''Grammy in the Schools'' in which past Grammy winners visit the city's public schools and talk about what it's like to work in the record industry.</p>
        <p>Although the Grammys will celebrate their 30th anniversary on March 2, the show has been on television only since 1971, when Mr. Cossette, the former owner of Dunhill Records, organized the first telecast. The three previous New York telecasts were at the Felt Forum, the Uris Theater and Radio City Music Hall.</p>
        <p>The show next year cannot be planned in detail until the nominations, encompassing 72 categories, are announced on Jan. 14. But Mr. Cossette hopes to stage a number of what he called ''generic musical tributes'' to New York-identified music, ranging from doo-wop to Latin-jazz to classical quartets. The comic actor Billy Crystal is to be the host for the second straight year.</p>
        <p>While it remains to be seen whether the economics of producing the Grammys in New York City will allow the show to become a regular biennial event here, Mr. Cossette expressed a cautious optimism.</p>
        <p>''Like every other business, you have to balance your figures,'' Mr. Cossette said. ''The last time we came here, we lost money. But I think that with reasonable cooperation it can be workable. Although most of the talent may be in Los Angeles, the music industry is still very much in New York. And there's no question that the vitality of the Big Apple gives the show an extra excitement.''</p>
