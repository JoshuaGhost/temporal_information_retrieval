        <p>LEAD: The back problems that have plagued Jim Burt during his seven years with the Giants have returned.</p>
        <p>The back problems that have plagued Jim Burt during his seven years with the Giants have returned.</p>
        <p>The Pro Bowl nose tackle was listed today as doubtful for Sunday's game here between the Giants (3-8) and the Philadelphia Eagles (5-6). While the Giants held practice in Giants Stadium, Burt remained in bed in his home in Waldwick, N.J., with back spasms.</p>
        <p>''He's not going to be in for a while,'' said Coach Bill Parcells. But when Parcells was asked if Burt seemed headed for the injured-reserve list, he said, ''Not yet.'' One member of the Giants' staff said he thought Burt might be on the practice field by the end of the week, which meant Burt might play some against the Eagles. Club Signs Rookie</p>
        <p>In any event, Erik Howard, who had been playing more and more, will start this week at nose tackle. John Washington, normally a defensive end, will be the first backup. And today the Giants signed Bill Berthusen, a rookie defensive lineman they cut in training camp, for the rest of this season and next year.</p>
        <p>Burt joined the Giants as a rookie free agent. His toughness and enthusiasm helped him become a starter in 1983, but a herniated disk in the back has threatened his career since.</p>
        <p>After he had missed half of the 1983 season, an enzyme treatment seemed to relieve the back problem. He played every game in 1984 and 1985. But last season he missed three games because of the back, and 10 days ago his back acted up in the loss to the New Orleans Saints.</p>
        <p>Howard played in most of last Sunday's loss to the Washington Redskins. Burt played some, and after the game he was in pain when he sat and in pain when he stood.</p>
        <p>''After the game,'' said Howard, ''he said in so many words that it's going to be me this week. He said, 'Don't expect any relief time.' '' Doctor Prescribes Rest</p>
        <p>''I don't imagine the game did Burt any good,'' said Parcells. ''Now the doctor says he wants him to rest.''</p>
        <p>Howard was one of the Giants' four second-round draft choices in 1986. He has played well as the occasional nose tackle in the Giants' normal 3-4 defense, and as a regular defensive tackle in the four-man pass rush. He has also played at times at defensive end, his position at Washington State.</p>
        <p>''It really makes no difference for me if I play the whole game,'' said Howard. ''It's just a little less rest. I don't have to change anything except maybe run a little more during the week so I won't get tired. The last time I played a whole game was at Washington last year when we clinched the division title.</p>
        <p>''That was a difficult game because I just came off injured reserve with a broken hand. I hadn't been playing at all. To go from nothing to everything was tough.''</p>
        <p>Berthusen is 6 feet 5 inches and 285 pounds, with a degree in finance from Iowa State. The Giants drafted him this year on the 12th round as a defensive end, only to waive him on the next-to-last roster cut of the preseason.</p>
        <p>''Coach Parcells said he was pleased with everything I did,'' said Berthusen. ''He said I just needed a little work.''</p>
        <p>When the National Football League players went on strike after two weeks of the regular season, the Giants tried to sign Berthusen for their replacement team. But the Cincinnati Bengals had called him first, and he said his agent thought he might have an opportunity to stay with the Bengals after the strike.</p>
        <p>So he signed with the Bengals and started all three replacement games at nose tackle. When the strike ended, the Bengals waived all of their replacement players. Berthusen went home to Marshalltown, Iowa, spent time with his family and worked part time in a carpet store for $3.75 an hour.</p>
        <p>''I guess my luck has turned around now,'' he said.  Taylor Works Out</p>
        <p>Lawrence Taylor, the All-Pro outside linebacker, took part in Wednesday's practice, and Parcells listed him as questionable (50-50) for Sunday. Taylor missed most of the Saints game and all of the Redskins game because of an injured right hamstring. . . . To make room for Berthusen on the roster, the Giants placed Stacy Robinson on injured reserve. The third-year wide receiver has a cracked bone in the lower left leg. The Giants still have five wide receivers - Lionel Manuel, Phil McConkey, Stephen Baker, Mark Ingram and Odessa Turner.</p>
