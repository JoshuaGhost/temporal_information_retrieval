        <p>LEAD: DR. ERNEST LIT ANOTHER cigarette, tilted his head back and blew a stream of smoke toward the ceiling. He said he thought I was among those few people who could benefit from psychoanalysis. I took it as a compliment.</p>
        <p>DR. ERNEST LIT ANOTHER cigarette, tilted his head back and blew a stream of smoke toward the ceiling. He said he thought I was among those few people who could benefit from psychoanalysis. I took it as a compliment.</p>
        <p>He cited my inquiring mind, my intelligence, my writer's perception and my age, 24, as some of the qualifications that would suit me for the rigorous and demanding course of orthodox Freudian analysis - a 50-minute hour, five days a week for an unspecified number of years - four or five was about the minimum, he told me. It would not only be expensive in terms of time and commitment, but also in cash. The standard charge - this was in 1956 - was $25 an hour, which meant $125 a week, $500 a month, $6,000 a year. That was a decent annual income then, about double the amount of money I had made and lived on during my first year as a freelance writer.</p>
        <p>It would be difficult to call on my parents for help, since they were going through a divorce.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ernest suggested I apply for a sort of scholarship that was sometimes given to patients whose background and problems suited the interests of analysts in training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.</p>
        <p>How could my problem not be right for a brilliant young analyst hot to effect a cure? I was a writer and impotent. I could not love, therefore I could not live, therefore I could not write.</p>
        <p>I had no idea that impotence was not an uncommon experience for novices, but assumed it meant I was doomed, a sexual cripple, unless some unlikely miracle could cure me. What more exquisite torture was there than to watch other people meet and mate and marry when I was damned from being able to do it myself?</p>
        <p>One of my buddies had recently married a girl I'd fixed him up with. The week before the big day, I had bourboned myself into near oblivion - the first time I'd done it as a way of not being aware, of blotting out pain I couldn't bear. I had locked myself in the bathroom with a vengeance and a purpose. I'd unwrapped a razor blade and stroked it across my wrist, drawing blood. I did not dig deep enough to sever anything, but enough to flay the body that betrayed my soul, to protest the refusal of flesh that said ''No'' to love.</p>
        <p>I filled out the scholarship forms with difficulty, embarrassed to reveal my shame on paper, couching my sexual impotence in roundabout language. Then I waited. I saw Dr. Ernest for occasional therapy sessions paid for by my mother.</p>
        <p>I did not want to die, despite all the anguish I had experienced. I wanted to live, and love, and write and become whole. And, in particular, I wanted to be healed by that latest, most rigorous modern scientific method of treatment, Freudian psychoanalysis. (Some people use the terms ''psychoanalysis'' and ''analysis'' as synonymous with ''psychotherapy'' and ''therapy,'' and that has led to some confusing discussions and misunderstandings. It's important for me to make clear that the treatment I wanted to enter is distinct from psychotherapy, even as practiced by the Freudian school of psychiatry. Psychotherapy may last for a long or short time, with doctor and patient talking to each other face to face. Psychoanalysis consists of four or five sessions a week over a number of years, with the patient lying on a couch, ''free-associating'' to a doctor, who sits behind in a chair out of sight and responds very little. If the treatment is successful, the patient undergoes a ''transference'' of emotions, projecting onto the anonymous doctor the feelings that were subconsciously blocking his full functioning.) Like many in my generation, I had already made the intellectual substitution of Freud for God. I was seeking from Freudian psychoanalysis the long-lasting, earthly kind of salvation I hadn't gotten from baptism and church and Jesus. Such a salvation, I thought, would not only cure my sexual hang-ups but make me a better writer - in fact, ''unblock'' whatever was stopping me from writing my novel. It angered me that some people joked about psychiatry and called therapists and analysts ''shrinks.'' I believed they did not shrink the mind, but enlarged it.</p>
        <p>I would enter psychoanalysis with the high seriousness of purpose and commitment of an acolyte taking vows to a rigorous religious order. The answer to my problems would be there, hidden in childhood, in some early trauma, perhaps even at birth. By digging down, by going through the muck of the years, beneath the debris of the unconscious, with pain but dedication, I would finally - like Galahad reaching the Grail - come upon the trauma, recapture it, and, in so doing, dispel its power, making myself whole and free. I would intone the magic name for whatever moment had turned the screws on my developing psyche and shout the name from the rooftops with a happy ring of personal freedom.</p>
        <p>I WAS TURNED DOWN FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP BY THE New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Was this good or bad? Did it mean I wasn't screwed up enough to be interesting, or was my case too difficult to be dealt with by someone in training? No matter, my parents - who had decided to get married again to each other - agreed to pay for the long and expensive treatment, one that would certainly mean a steady drain on their financial resources. They, no doubt, felt guilty about their own responsibility in having a man-child whose problems were such that this treatment had been strongly urged. And I felt guilty about taking their money and vowed I would someday pay it back (a vow I would keep, years later).</p>
        <p>I asked Dr. Ernest if he himself would conduct my analysis. I liked and trusted him and felt I had benefited from the therapy I had already had with him. Who better to be my guide on this arduous interior journey? Dr. Ernest thanked me for the confidence but said it would not be the best procedure. He explained that, after the open, interpersonal communication that had been established between us, it would be difficult to switch to the rigorous, impersonal framework of analysis. Dr. Ernest was telling me that I already knew a little too much about him as a human being to be able to begin with him as a blank screen on which to make my projections and thus bring about the curative process of transference.</p>
        <p>And so I went to see the man I'll call Dr. Stanley. His office was quietly elegant with several small, original contemporary paintings on the wall as well as a certificate of membership in the New York Psychoanalytic Association. Dr. Stanley wore horn-rimmed glasses, a dark, three-piece suit made of some heavy flannel or woolen material, a thin, dark tie with a muted pattern and a starched white shirt. His dark brown hair was sternly clipped in a crewcut. I could not help wondering if the vest constraining his potbelly contributed to the rather bulging look of his eyes. He reminded me of a bullfrog dressed up as a banker, and his raspy voice contributed to that impression.</p>
        <p>''Tell me, Mistuh Wakefield,'' he asked in his heavy New York accent, ''is theah any pah-ticulah paht of a woman's clothing that arouses you sexually?''</p>
        <p>He breathed heavily, no doubt from the tightness of his vest. I pondered the question, trying not to panic and give ''the wrong answer.'' In fact I was aroused by all women's clothing, as I was by all parts of women's bodies, but I was embarrassed to confess and say ''All of it,'' so I simply said ''No,'' deciding that amounted to about the same thing anyway, since it didn't focus on any particular item.</p>
        <p>That was the only question Dr. Stanley asked me - aside from how the bills would be paid - before beginning the psychoanalysis. He said that, until the analysis was completed in four or five years (and only he, as the doctor, could determine when the treatment was complete), I was not to make any major life changes. I was not to move to another place, go into another kind of work or get married. In a sense, I had to agree to put my life ''on hold'' in regard to such big decisions. I nodded my assent.  Every weekday, I commuted from the streets of East Harlem, where I had gone to live while doing research about that neighborhood for a book, to Dr. Stanley's couch on Park Avenue. The $500 or so of my parents' money I paid every month would have fed and clothed the dozen or so families of the five-story tenement building I lived in. I tried not to think about that. My psychoanalysis seemed like a separate compartment of my life, a secret chamber the size of Dr. Stanley's chic office. The time on the couch itself, the famous 50-minute analytic hour, was not at all what I had imagined. It was not only disappointing, it was a crashing bore.</p>
        <p>But how could it be? How could anyone - especially a self-absorbed only child such as myself - fail to be fascinated by talking about himself for almost an hour every day? Well, try it some time when the person you are talking to is sitting behind you out of sight and almost never says anything other than ''Yes, go on.'' Freudian psychoanalysis is not a conversation.</p>
        <p>I eagerly poured out the contents of my mind as I lay on the couch, and, of course, it came out haphazardly, rambling, repetitious, boring even to me. I was always glad to have had a dream, because that seemed to promise something extra, the hope of some insight that might move this tedious process forward, make something happen. I took dreams to the sessions as happily as a dog with a wagging tail takes a stick to its master (but without the resulting pat on the head or words of appreciation - only ''yes, go on.'') I even began having what I thought of as ''Freudian dreams'' - that is, dreams that I thought were the sort of thing one was supposed to have in a good Freudian analysis and so would prove I was a good patient who was making progress. Once I even dreamed I had sex with my mother, and I thought this must be the big breakthrough. In fact, there was little emotion or reality about it, and I felt it was a fake, a dream my unconscious had hoked up just to satisfy what it was supposed to be doing. The doctor said, ''Yes, go on.'' But less than a year into the analysis came a real breakthrough - the one I had been hoping for, wanting more than anything in life. I made love to a woman. I didn't just do it to prove I could do it, or to pass a test. I did it with a wonderful young woman I loved.</p>
        <p>''I'm fine,'' I told the doctor on Monday. ''I did it. I can do it.'' I wondered if this meant I was one of those rare analysands who simply completed the course early, a Freudian prodigy, a precocious pupil whose free association was so profound it had freed him early of the very problem that put him into treatment.</p>
        <p>The doctor disabused me of such an illusion. He patiently explained that impotence was simply a ''symptom.'' Curing it, I gathered, was only a sort of side effect, a bonus on the way to the real booty, the treasure of knowing and, thus, being in command of, the self. I realized with the help of the doctor's disapproval that I mustn't settle for less than the full self-knowledge I had set out to find in the first place. So I settled back on the the couch. ''Yes, go on.'' A few weeks later, I announced I wanted to marry my girlfriend, but the doctor reminded me sternly that that was not part of the agreement I had entered into. My girlfriend should be so in-formed. She cried, and I did too. Then we fought, drifted apart and finally fell away from each other for good. I was afraid to break the analytic pact (or was it only an excuse for getting out of a commitment?) I settled in for the long haul, morally certified by medical science from making any commitments. I could meet women, fall for them, get into a relationship, and explain with lofty righteousness that it could go no further, we could not ''get serious.'' It gave me a ticket to irresponsibility and made noninvolvement a way of life.</p>
        <p>In my second year, I was living in Greenwich Village, and, more and more often, I went to my East Side sessions by cab. By the third year, I woke with a hangover on more days than not. It became my routine to buy a milkshake, get a newspaper and hail a cab to go uptown. The cab fare was often more than I spent on food.</p>
        <p>I had started drinking more, in a regular way and always when I was out with women. Sometimes the old problem of impotence reoccurred, and drinking became a part of the problem, but I didn't know how to control it. Dr. Stanley gave me no advice about it, for that would have meant involvement. He had to remain aloof, detached, the blank screen.</p>
        <p>I also often drank when I was alone. A girlfriend had me see her doctor and he said I should drink less. I tried to ''cut down,'' and the effort must have lasted for a month or so. It didn't even occur to me to stop altogether. I postponed doing anything about the drinking because I figured when I hit upon the secret of my childhood I wouldn't need to drink so much, so it would automatically come under control on that magic day of revelation when all my neuroses fell away and my real life began.</p>
        <p>But when was it going to happen? Except for my improved sexual performance, things went on pretty much the same. I poured more thoughts and dreams and memories and time and parental money into the analysis, but there was no sign of light, no glimmer of understanding much less healing revelation. The first dramatic thing that happened did not occur until after more than three years, perhaps almost four.</p>
        <p>One day when I went in the waiting room a little early for my appointment, I saw that the door to Dr. Stanley's office was slightly ajar. He had said that whenever the door was open to come ahead into the office, so I pushed the door open and went in. He looked up in surprise from something he was reading and yelled at me. He shouted that I was never, under any circumstances, to come into his office when the door was closed. I said the door had been open. He said it had only been open a crack, and by mistake, and only when it was fully open was I supposed to come in unless he had come out to the waiting room and told me to enter. He was red in the face and far more angry than seemed appropriate in response to my unintentional breach of etiquette. I knew at that moment that whatever he might swear about clinical detachment, he simply did not like me, and I knew I did not like him either. I hadn't liked him from the first. I yelled back at him. Shaken, and shaking with rage, I rushed out of the office.</p>
        <p>I went home and poured myself a drink. I was not only angry, I was afraid. I was entrusting the most private and precious part of my life to someone who didn't like me and whom I neither liked nor trusted. I would never lie down on his couch again. I went back the next day at the proper time for my appointment and I sat on the couch while he sat in his chair and I talked to him, face to face. He apologized for his anger. He said we should go on with ''the treatment.'' I told him I didn't think he liked me, and he denied it. I said I did not like him, and never had, and furthermore I didn't trust him. He said all that was something we could ''work with.''</p>
        <p>I refused. For the first time in more than three years of analysis, I rebelled. My rebellion was limited - I did not want to give up analysis, not after investing all I had in it for all this time, not when I might be only a year or two away from the fabulous interior recognition that would make me free. So I told Dr. Stanley I wanted to see another analyst. We discussed this for three or four sessions, and finally he concluded I would not reconsider. He agreed to find me another doctor.</p>
        <p>I went back to see my original therapist, Dr. Ernest, but he was extremely guarded. It was obvious that he didn't want to put himself in opposition to Dr. Stanley, nor, least of all, to the Psychoanalytic Institute. He said that it really didn't matter who the doctor was as long as he was properly trained in this treatment, which was insured by his being a member of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. I might as well have been going from one Jesuit to the next.</p>
        <p>I spoke to a good friend who had been in some kind of ''analysis'' (or so he referred to it) that had involved group therapy and sessions only two or three times a week - obviously not orthodox. In the end, though, I did not have the nerve to go outside the sect I had started with. I had the determination to change the priest, but not the denomination.</p>
        <p>TO MY RUEFUL AMUSEMENT, my new analyst was also ''Dr. Stanley.'' He was also, of course, a member of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, and he had his office on the East Side. I thought of him as Stanley II. His suits, though, were made of some shiny, light brown or gray material, and he wore loud ties with white-on-white shirts. He did not look like a banker so much as, perhaps, a business agent of a teamsters' union local in the Bronx. I wondered if he were sent all the castoffs - the difficult patients who got mad at their original analysts and hadn't shown much hope or progress anyway. He looked like that might be his lot. The same process resumed on the same kind of black leather couch.</p>
        <p>In my ''real life,'' the drinking increased. Again, I tried to ''cut down,'' but everyone I knew drank - I just drank a little more sometimes than others. But everyone drank a little more sometimes, didn't they? Especially if they were writers. It was part of the lore.</p>
        <p>Then I began to have blackouts. I remember drinking with a girlfriend, going back to her apartment. Then I remember being on the street by myself, drunk and trying to call Stanley I to tell him what I really thought of him, to wake him from his complacent sleep and disturb his fat, bullfrog dreams. Of course I got only his answering service.</p>
        <p>One day I realized I had been in analysis for five years. I had reached 30. I had begun to meet people at parties who had been in analysis for 10, 12, even 15 years, still with no end in sight. I tried to assess my own salvation so far. That I had any kind of sexual satisfaction at all I attributed more to the almost saintly patience and kindness of women than I did to Freud or to Stanley I or II. I credited one childhood memory about my father with giving me a more sympathetic view of him, though I could not be sure it was not something I would have realized anyway in the course of my life without daily sessions on the couch. None of it seemed worth the expense in time, money and postponement of ''real life.''</p>
        <p>To stop would mean giving up the grand hope psychoanalysis offered, but my life was passing. I told Stanley II that I would give it one more year. Then I would terminate the treatment, regardless of where I was in it or whether or not I had achieved the progress I or he had hoped for. He did not express approval or disapproval. He said, in the same flat monotone as always, ''Yes, go on.''</p>
        <p>Then it came. The nightmare. With only three months left in the black hole of analysis, I told Stanley II about an especially disturbing dream. In the dream, the face of one of my best friends was disfigured, blighted, leperlike, in an even more disgusting mask than I had worn with the worst of the acne that had afflicted me during adolescence. When I told the doctor the dream, it became more real. It was sickening. I walked out of his office with it still erupting in my mind. I tried to shake it, but it only came back, multiplied in greater distortion. Suddenly my whole waking consciousness was overwhelmed by it. I was nauseated and terrified.</p>
        <p>That night I got drunk. When I woke, the hallucinations were worse. I couldn't get them out of my mind. They were there if I closed my eyes or opened them. They were there like a living hell everywhere I turned, everywhere I looked. I couldn't stand it. I would try to put other pictures in my head, pictures of beautiful things, like flowers, but as soon as I did, the flowers became distorted themselves; they grew warts or pustules, the lovely leaves became eaten away and blackened with disease.</p>
        <p>I had not taken mescaline or LSD or any other drug, except alcohol, and I had never heard of any alchoholic hallucinations as severe or sustained. The only relieving image that came to my mind was a human skull. I told someone about it, sobbing, explaining that it was the only thing I wanted to picture because it was ''clean.'' I knew it was death, and I knew death was luring me.</p>
        <p>I told Dr. Stanley I needed help. I thought I was going crazy - if I didn't stop seeing these things I would surely go crazy. He prescribed some tranquilizers. I slid off the couch in agony and onto the floor of his office. He remained immobile in his chair. I crawled to the chair next to it and began picking up one leg of it and hitting the bottom of the leg against my face. I couldn't get off the floor. He told me the hour would soon be up and asked if I had a friend he could call to come and get me.</p>
        <p>Friends came. Friends kept me alive. One of them, Alice, kept especially long vigils. Once, in Alice's apartment, I was so unhinged, so desperate in my desire to hide myself from my unbearable visions, that I actually tried to crawl into her fireplace.</p>
        <p>I wanted to be in a hospital. I asked Stanley II if he couldn't put me in a hospital and give me some kind of sedative so I could at least get some rest and nourishment. Maybe I could be fed by a needle or a tube. Anything. He told me in his analytic monotone that this raised a difficult dilemma. He said that if he put me in the kind of hospital he would approve of my being in, he would no longer be the principal physician in charge of my case. On the other hand, the kind of hospital he could put me in and remain in charge was not the kind of hospital whose care he approved of. I asked him, at least, to tell me what was happening to me. He said we had entered ''the heartland'' of the analytic experience.</p>
        <p>I cursed the doctor and accused him of irresponsibility and deception, of unethical and immoral behavior. I told him he had got me into a life-threatening situation which he did not himself understand and obviously did not know how to deal with. I told him he had unleashed something through the analytic process that he did not know how to help me through. He had no right to have done it. I said that both he and the First Stanley had deceived me in saying this was a ''scientific'' medical treatment I was undergoing. He insisted it was exactly that. I said, ''Do you mean to tell me that what we are doing here, the process that has led me to this unbearable madness, is as scientific as diagnosing and setting a broken leg?'' He looked me in the eye and said that was exactly the case.</p>
        <p>I called him a liar. I have not had reason in all the years since to change that opinion.</p>
        <p>THE LIVING HELL OF THE ever-changing hallucinations lasted for nearly six weeks. Then it began to ease. I was able to sleep and eat and live again more or less as I had before. During the season in hell the only thing that had brought relief was drinking cold, clean water out of a metal cup I found in a friend's kitchen, and the memory of a fragment of the 23d Psalm. I prayed it continually, as incantation against the hell raging within me:</p>
        <p>''. . . though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me.''</p>
        <p>By the end of that summer, I was living in a small house in New Hampshire by a pond, and another part of the Psalm came to mind, bringing with it a deep and thankful sense of peace, like the calm that comes after surviving a terrible storm: ''He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul.''</p>
        <p>I am neither qualified nor interested in making a psychological evaluation of my experience in analysis. But from a spiritual point of view, I know it was my own dark night of the soul, in the deepest sense of that concept.</p>
        <p>Arthur Koestler contributed an essay to ''The God That Failed,'' a book by writers disillusioned with Communism. That title could apply to the effort of those like myself who later tried to find through Freudian psychoanalysis a substitute for God, a ''scientific'' formula for self-gratification, for ''having my own way.'' The kind of analysis I was engaged in, orthodox Freudian analysis, has declined nationally and today is one of the least-practiced forms of treatment.</p>
        <p>I later found psychiatric help, as I had before with Dr. Ernest, using psychotherapy as an aid to ease the pains of life, rather than to provide a meaning for it. I am sure there are people who are able to use psychoanalysis that way also, but I was not one of them.</p>
