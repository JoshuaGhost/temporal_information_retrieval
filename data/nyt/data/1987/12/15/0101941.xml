        <p>LEAD: The wholesale price of the only drug shown to prolong the lives of AIDS patients has been reduced by 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The wholesale price of the only drug shown to prolong the lives of AIDS patients has been reduced by 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The Burroughs Wellcome Company, the drug's manufacturer, said yesterday that it was reducing the price of azidothymide, or AZT, because its own costs had dropped.</p>
        <p>The company has been criticized for the high price of the drug, which costs patients as much as $10,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The company has said the high price was necessary to recoup substantial development and production costs. Now, the company said, it is producing more of the drug at lower cost at its plants in Greenville, N.C., and Darrford, England. The company said it hoped the price reduction would be passed on to patients.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Albany that his agency would be monitoring pharmacies ''to make sure the entire price reduction is passed on directly to AIDS patients.'' 'Step in Right Direction'</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessler, whose agency has criticized Burroughs Wellcome over AZT prices, said that while the price cut was ''a step in the right direction,'' he continued to believe that the price of AZT was ''excessive.'' He added: ''Until Burroughs Wellcome provides the Federal and State Governments with information on how they arrive at this price, I won't be satisfied.''</p>
        <p>The company announced the price reduction two days before a scheduled meeting to discuss AZT prices with the state consumer board and Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan who is chairman of the State Assembly committee on consumer protection.</p>
        <p>AZT, marketed under the trade name Retrovir, is licensed in 37 countries and is being prescribed to more than 19,000 patients worldwide. A Burroughs Wellcome official said that more than 10,000 take it in the United States.</p>
        <p>As of Dec. 15, the company said, the price of AZT to the wholesale distributor will be reduced to $150.24 for a bottle of a hundred 100-milligram capsules The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last spring for certain patients with aquired immune deficiency syndrome or severe AIDS-related complex. A Federal study has shown that the drug can prolong the lives of this group of AIDS patients. Further studies are under way on other patient groups.</p>
