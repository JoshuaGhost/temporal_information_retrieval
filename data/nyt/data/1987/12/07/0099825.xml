        <p>LEAD: While Congressional committees were picking away at the Federal budget last week, looking for $30-odd billion to cut in the inconclusive war on the Federal budget deficit, J. Peter Grace was flying around the world calling them clowns.</p>
        <p>While Congressional committees were picking away at the Federal budget last week, looking for $30-odd billion to cut in the inconclusive war on the Federal budget deficit, J. Peter Grace was flying around the world calling them clowns.</p>
        <p>''They aren't serious,'' he says. ''If they were, they would have called me.''</p>
        <p>And Peter Grace would have told them, too, just as he has told thousands of others in the last three years, exactly how to cut twice that much without raising taxes a nickel. And then he would have told them how they could go back and do it again next year, for a total of $120 billion, quick, rather than the iffy $76 billion to which the Administration and Congress have tentatively agreed. All Government has to do is to act more like a private business, he would say. W.R. Grace Has Own Problems</p>
        <p>Not like his own business, mind you. Mr. Grace serves as chairman, president and chief executive of W. R. Grace &amp; Company, the conglomerate founded by his grandfather 133 years ago. Last year W. R. Grace lost $472 million on sales of $3.7 billion.</p>
        <p>While much of the red ink came from a restructuring, Grace has drifted downward for years. Earnings for 1985, the year before the overhaul, were less than half what they had been in 1981. But the company, with three good quarters this year, expects to return to profitability when the totals are added up next month.</p>
        <p>So Grace may not be the model. Rather, Congress should adopt the policies recommended by the phalanx of business executives whom Mr. Grace assembled at President Reagan's urging to examine waste in the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>These 2,000 business leaders studied the Federal bureaucracy from top to bottom from 1982 to 1984, then produced 21,000 pages of studies. Official Washington knew them as the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, but to the rest of the world they were the Grace Commission.</p>
        <p>They discovered that those who serve in the military or work in the Federal civil service retire after many fewer years on the payroll than their counterparts in private industry. And pensions run generously to 75 percent of pay, compared with 50 percent or less in the private sector.</p>
        <p>As a result, Uncle Sam spends six times as much on the pension of a civil service employee, and eight times as much for military retirees, as the best private company spends on its workers. $19 Billion Could Be Saved Reform just that one item and save $19 billion a year, the commission reported. And save even more in the future, because the Government has already agreed to pay pensions that will cost $500 billion - but has set aside no money yet to cover the bill. If you were serious you would also add employees-to-be, but who's counting? Not Congress, Mr. Grace said. Not the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>''That's intellectually dishonest,'' Mr. Grace said. ''It's stealing from the young people of the future.''</p>
        <p>If the Government can't stomach that reform, Mr. Grace has 2,477 other recommendations, ranging from higher fees in national parks to better cash management techniques for Federal money. Some are being pursued, but none would save nearly so much as the pension changes. Taken together, though, they would reduce the Federal budget gap by more than $420 billion over three years. The Tycoon of 42d Street</p>
        <p>All these ideas to trim the budget are sitting on the shelf, and no one from Capitol Hill even called.</p>
        <p>That's because sometimes it is hard to decide whether Mr. Grace, with his budget-cutting notions, is crazy like a fox, or just crazy.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there is his demeanor. At the age of 74, after 42 years as chief executive of W. R. Grace, he can be seen bouncing through the headquarters on West 42d Street with a mischievous glint in his eye, thumbing his nose playfully at the assistants who try to keep him on schedule in his international travels, tugging his vest down over his tummy without quite popping the buttons.</p>
        <p>In an office overlooking Bryant Park, he has surrounded himself with mementoes of his family: an oil portrait of his father and predecessor, photos of his five daughters, snapshots of family gatherings at one of his four houses and porcelain statues of dogs of all description. Smoking pipes, dozens of them, clutter two desks, the bookshelves and the window sill in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>It is the office of a tycoon, a patriarch. Today Mr. Grace controls only 1 percent of the enterprise that bears his grandfather's name, but he rules it like a fief. He is a holdover from another day, sustaining himself by force of personality. The Grace Coalition</p>
        <p>Then there is his method of waging war on waste. With no visible result, he has spent thousands of hours, and hundreds of thousands of his own and his company's dollars, crisscrossing the country with his message, preaching to the converted in hundreds of business audiences.</p>
        <p>He has enlisted Jack Anderson, the newspaper columnist, as his Sancho Panza in a grass-roots organization known as Citizens Against Government Waste. He has enrolled 164 members of Congress in what he calls the Grace Caucus.</p>
        <p>But Congress, the target of his assaults, pays no attention. As recently as mid-November, Congress dismissed the idea of pension reform and a suspension of automatic increases in Social Security payments - the largest items by far on the Grace Commission's list - as politically unworkable.</p>
        <p>That sounded familiar to Mr. Grace. When his commission delivered its report in 1985, Washington generally pooh-poohed him. He doesn't understand politics, said senators and representatives, lobbyists and Cabinet members. The people who receive Federal pensions vote, they said. The people who receive pensions from private businesses don't elect the board of directors of their company.</p>
        <p>But Peter Grace is in for the long haul. He has outlasted several successors presumptive at W. R. Grace. He endures; they pass from the scene. A Lesson From New York City</p>
        <p>And Mr. Grace has seen government get its comeuppance. He served as a volunteer adviser to Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1975 as the Mayor struggled without success to prop up New York City's worm-eaten municipal budget.</p>
        <p>''Walter Wriston called me one night when I was on a business trip in Tennessee,'' Mr. Grace recalled. Mr. Wriston at the time was chairman of Citibank and leader of a bankers committee with which the city was negotiating for additional credit. He had a message for Mr. Grace to deliver to Mayor Beame: ''Tell your boy that we aren't going to roll over his loans,'' Mr. Grace remembers Mr. Wriston saying.</p>
        <p>The banks' refusal touched off a panic. Municipal bonds collapsed. Corporations with headquarters in New York accelerated their plans to leave the city.</p>
        <p>''That scared the boys at City Hall,'' Mr. Grace said, with more than a hint of satisfaction that a bunch of politicians had been taught a financial lesson. Nothing else would move them, but the threat of bankruptcy set them to hacking and hewing at the municipal budget. Thousands of police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers lost their jobs, ending the notion that employment with the city meant employment for life. A state agency was given control of the city's finances.</p>
        <p>''Things got better,'' Mr. Grace said. ''The politicians were scared enough to balance the budget. Now the Mayor of New York can spend his time in Nicaragua telling them how to run their Government.'' Federal Problem Is Different</p>
        <p>Though New York overcame its fiscal problems in less than a decade, the Federal Government cannot solve its budget crisis the same way, Mr. Grace said. ''In the first place, they can't go broke,'' he said. ''They can always print more money.'' That explains why the stock market crash has not frightened the Federal Government into a more serious effort to eliminate the deficit, by, for instance, reforming Federal pensions and postponing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grace thinks the only way to change the spending habits of ''the yellow bellies'' in Washington is for the voters to frighten members of Congress.</p>
        <p>''Moynihan starts getting sensible when Giuliani says he might run against him,'' Mr. Grace said, referring to the Democratic Senator from New York and to the United States Attorney in Manhattan, widely considered a possible opponent next year.</p>
        <p>''Write to Congress,'' he advises the business audiences that hang on his every word. ''If you don't think that'll do it, run for Congress. That ought to scare 'em.''</p>
