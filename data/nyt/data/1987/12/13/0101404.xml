        <p>LEAD: Q. I am having a problem removing nonskid bathtub decals I put down five years ago. I had taken up the old ones and put new ones in their place without ever getting all the old adhesive off. Now I would like to remove these decals and the sticky residue left. I have tried benzine, nail-polish remover and Spray 'N' Wash (which was recommended by the manufacturer of these decals), but I have only been able to remove the top layer, not the adhesive.</p>

        <p>Q. I am having a problem removing nonskid bathtub decals I put down five years ago. I had taken up the old ones and put new ones in their place without ever getting all the old adhesive off. Now I would like to remove these decals and the sticky residue left. I have tried benzine, nail-polish remover and Spray 'N' Wash (which was recommended by the manufacturer of these decals), but I have only been able to remove the top layer, not the adhesive.</p>
        <p>A. One trick is to heat the decals with a hair dryer or heat gun before scraping them off with a wood or plastic scraper. Any glue left can almost always be removed with lacquer thinner or acetone. I have also heard that you can use a chemical oven cleaner.</p>
        <p>Q. We recently installed an electric hot water heater in our unheated laundry room. Our electric company has offered to wrap this heater with insulation, which it says would help to reduce our bill, but the company we purchased the heater from says this is not a good idea. It says that wrapping the heater with insulation traps moisture and can lead to corrosion problems.</p>
        <p>A. Wrapping with insulation is always a good idea and should help to lower electric bills (make sure the terminal box and other electric controls are not covered). I can see no drawback, and I can think of no reason why there should be moisture on the heater.</p>
        <p>Questions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.</p>
