        <p>LEAD: One of two black victims of what the police have termed a racial assault by a group of white youths in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn on Christmas day likened their attackers yesterday to ''a wolf pack'' intent on hurting or killing them.</p>
        <p>One of two black victims of what the police have termed a racial assault by a group of white youths in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn on Christmas day likened their attackers yesterday to ''a wolf pack'' intent on hurting or killing them.</p>
        <p>''They were coming from all angles like a wolf pack, rearing over cars, dodging in between cars, coming from behind vans, in front of vans,'' said one of the victims, Steven LaMont, at a press conference yesterday in the Manhattan office of C. Vernon Mason, an attorney. ''They were coming at us like a mob, a wolf pack. And all they wanted to do was hurt us, hurt or to kill.''</p>
        <p>The police said at least a half dozen white youths attacked Mr. LaMont, 31 years old, and his brother, Sylvester, 29, on 24th Avenue as they were collecting redeemable bottles. The incident occurred several blocks from the Marlboro Houses, a project in the nearby Bensonhurst section where the two men lived with relatives. Criticism of Koch</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason said the incident was rooted in what he called a climate of racial division and animosity that has been fostered by Mayor Koch. He said Mr. Koch had done nothing ''to even suggest that he is a person who believes in fairness and justice.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Mayor, Clifford Chanin, called Mr. Mason's remarks ''baseless and reprehensible.'' He added, ''They seem intended to inflame passions, not calm the situation.''</p>
        <p>One youth has been arrested so far in the incident, which the police say occurred at 10:55 P.M. Friday. Investigators of the 62d Precinct Detective Squad and the Bias Investigation Unit were canvassing the neighborhood yesterday in search of witnesses, said a police department spokesman, Sgt. John Clifford. Suspect Released on Bail The youth, Douglas Malliband, 19, of 23-22 West 12th Street, was arraigned Sunday morning in Brooklyn Criminal Court on two counts of assault in the second degree, two counts of aggravated harassment, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon and two counts of civil rights violations. He was released on $1,000 cash bail.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaMont, an unemployed bus driver, and his brother, Sylvester, a former driver for the United Cerebral Palsy Association, said they were attacked by perhaps up to 10 people with sticks, a marble slab and a knife.</p>
        <p>They said that they were saved from serious harm by three young white women with the white youths who kept telling them to stop the assault and a white auxiliary police officer who intervened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason, who with another black attorney, Alton H. Maddox Jr., successfully pressed Governor Cuomo to replace the Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci, in investigating the Howard Beach incident, said yesterday that he was not ready to do so in this case. He said he hoped the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, would take the same ''hands-on'' approach that the Special State Prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, used in the Howard Beach case.</p>
