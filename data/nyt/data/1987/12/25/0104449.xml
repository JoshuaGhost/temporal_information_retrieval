        <p>LEAD: If New Year's Eve seems just a tad longer than usual this year, it's no illusion. During the final countdown to the penultimate year of the penultimate decade of the 20th century, the last minute of 1987 will actually have 61 seconds.</p>
        <p>If New Year's Eve seems just a tad longer than usual this year, it's no illusion. During the final countdown to the penultimate year of the penultimate decade of the 20th century, the last minute of 1987 will actually have 61 seconds.</p>
        <p>This so-called leap second - devised by astronomers and time-keepers to keep clocks synchronized with the rotation of the earth - will be duly noted with a one-second light show in Times Square, where the red ''Big Apple'' ball makes its annual descent to ring in the new year. About a quarter-million revelers are expected for what has been one of the modern world's most venerable public traditions since a ball first dropped in Times Square on Dec. 31, 1907.</p>
        <p>But, of course, that's not all that will be happening this New Year's Eve when time mometarily stands still.</p>
        <p>As the ball drops and corks pop, fireworks produced by a company called Zambelli Internationale will be exploding in the skies above Central Park in Manhattan and Prospect Park in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The Central Park fireworks - which will be launched near 63d and 93d Streets - will coincide with another local New Year's Eve tradition, the Central Park midnight run. At the stroke of midnight, more than 4,000 runners, in formal wear and other unlikely attire, will embark on a five-mile race through the park beginning at Tavern on the Green, near West 67th Street. The run will be preceded at 11:15 P.M. by a costume parade, and tens of thousands of spectators are anticipated. The race is sponsored by Moet &amp; Chandon, the Champagne concern, which will provide runners with sips of its product, and is conducted by the New York Road Runners Club. Registration for nonmembers is $12 ($10 in advance); information: 860-4455. Brooklyn Al Fresco</p>
        <p>Hot cider and live jazz are on the menu near Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, where an outdoor New Year's Eve party is to begin at 11:30 P.M. The Unity Band will perform and refreshments will be served just inside Prospect Park, and the skies above the park's Long Meadow will be painted with nearly 10 minutes of fireworks.</p>
        <p>While big bands and rock bands are booked into almost every grand hotel ballroom and nightclub in the city, various musical and theatrical galas are planned in concert halls, churches and other performance venues.</p>
        <p>The Carnegie Hall stage is being decorated by Tiffany's to look like a Victorian parlor for an evening of what could be broadly construed as Victorian music. The program includes pieces by Tchaikovsky and Offenbach, as well as a smattering of Gilbert and Sullivan, and popular Victorian era songs sung by Robert Tear, a tenor, and Benjamin Luxon, a baritone. Tickets for the 8 P.M. concert range from $20 to $200. (The top-priced tickets include an onstage champagne buffet after the concert.) Information: 247-7800 for the concert, or 903-9650 for the 10:30 P.M. buffet.</p>
        <p>Another morsel of Victoriana, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''H. M. S. Pinafore; or, the Lass That Loved a Sailor,'' will be the main course in an evening of musical theater and champagne at Symphony Space, at Broadway and 95th Street. Full of rollicking songs and happy nonsense, ''Pinafore'' is presented by the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players and stars John Reed as the First Lord of the Admiralty. The show is at 8 P.M., and is part of a two-week run that ends on Jan. 3. Tickets for New Year's Eve are $30, $25 and $20. Information: 769-1000. Music for Peace</p>
        <p>The world's largest Neo-Gothic-style church, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, is the setting for one of New York's most magnificent annual free concerts. Leonard Bernstein will be joined by the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the conductors Lukas Foss and Michael Barrett, and several illustrious soloists for the fifth New Year's Eve Concert for Peace, beginning at 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>The pianist Caroline Stoessinger will perform Mendelssohn's Capriccio Brilliante (Op. 22); the Schubert Society Chorus, with the baritone Ben Holt, will be featured in a performance of Mozart's ''Coronation Mass,'' and the folk singer Odetta will sing spirituals during a dramatic finale in which thousands of concertgoers are to be given candles to light. Norman Cousins, Jason Robards and Mr. Bernstein are to speak. The cathedral is on Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street. Information: 662-2133.</p>
        <p>At nearby Riverside Church, the 74 giant bells in the 392-foot bell tower will begin to peal at 10:15 P.M. This carillon recital will be followed by an organ concert and a watch night service with choir in the church, which is at Riverside Drive and 120th Street. Information: 220-5900, extension 448.  The Church of the Ascension, at Fifth Avenue and 10th Street, will present the Taghkanic Chorale and Orchestra, conducted by Dennis Keene, at 9 P.M. The concert by this Westchester-based community chorale features Mozart's Coronation Mass, Bach's Second Brandenburg Concerto and two of Handel's coronation anthems. Tickets are $15. Reservations: (914) 962-4113.</p>
        <p>Although the semi-traditional New Year's Eve performance of ''Die Fledermaus'' at the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet's ''Nutcracker'' and the New York Philharmonic's gala with Kathleen Battle and the Boys Choir of Harlem are sold out, one can still spend the evening at Lincoln Center. The Big Apple Circus, temporarily in residence in a giant tent in Damrosch Park, will present a medley of clowning, trained animals, acrobatics and death-defying stunts, beginning at 9:30 P.M. and ending shortly before midnight, in time for complimentary champagne. Tickets range from $15 to $50. Information: 391-0767. A New 'Nutcracker'</p>
        <p>While a cadre of sugar-plum fairies dances in Tchaikovsky's timeless Christmas ballet at the New York State Theater, a group of pennywhistle flutes will be dancing a half-mile away at City Center, where the Joffrey Ballet is presenting a new version of ''The Nutcracker.'' The five-day run begins Wednesday, and includes a Thursday performance at 3 P.M. City Center is at 131 West 55th Street. Tickets are $7.50 to $40. Information: 581-7907.</p>
        <p>Across the East River, a little barge is moored on the shores of Brooklyn, where chamber music is played every Thursday and Sunday. This fairy-tale concert hall known as Bargemusic will be adding a special New Year's Eve benefit performance at 7:30 P.M., featuring Bach's Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 3, 5 and 6. Tickets, which include a postconcert champagne reception, are $60. Information: (718) 624-4061.</p>
        <p>And for those with time on their hands, Peter Brook's ''Mahabharata,'' based on the epic, 100,000-stanza Indian poem, will be performed during most of Thursday afternoon and evening, at the Majestic Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. This marathon performance begins at 12:30 P.M. and - including two breaks - continues until 10:45 P.M. The theater is at 651 Fulton Street, Brooklyn Heights. Tickets are $96 and $30. Information: (718) 636-4100.</p>
