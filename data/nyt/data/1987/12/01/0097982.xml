        <p>LEAD: In a finding that has stunned scholars, a Yale professor revered as one of the most brilliant intellectuals of his generation wrote for an anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi newspaper in Belgium during World War II, documents have disclosed.</p>
        <p>In a finding that has stunned scholars, a Yale professor revered as one of the most brilliant intellectuals of his generation wrote for an anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi newspaper in Belgium during World War II, documents have disclosed.</p>
        <p>The professor, Paul de Man, died at the age of 65 in December 1984 while Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale, a post reserved for the university's brightest luminaries. Venerated as a teacher and scholar, he was the originator of a controversial theory of language that some say may place him among the great thinkers of his age.</p>
        <p>A researcher in Belgium has found at least 100 previously unknown articles Professor de Man wrote in 1941 and 1942 for Le Soir, a pro-Nazi newspaper. In one of the articles the young de Man addresses the question of whether Jews ''pollute'' modern fiction.</p>
        <p>The findings about a man respected at Yale and elsewhere have shocked scholars. Several predicted the information will fan an intellectual debate already under way over the ethical implications of Professor de Man's theories and method, dubbed ''deconstruction.''</p>
        <p>Deconstructionism views language as a slippery and inherently false medium that always reflects the biases of its users.</p>
        <p>At a memorial service, A. Bartlett Giamatti, then the president of Yale, eulogized Professor de Man as a ''tremendous light for humane life and learning'' after whom ''nothing for us will ever be the same.''</p>
        <p>''I was pained and saddened to learn of these writings,'' Neil Hertz, a close friend of Professor de Man's and a professor of humanities at Johns Hopkins University, said. ''They seem so at odds with the sense of the person I knew later on,'' Dr. Hertz said.</p>
        <p>Shochana Felman, a Yale professor of French and student of Dr. de Man, describes him as ''almost entirely without prejudice'' and says he ''took an ethical stance in all his daily life.''</p>
        <p>The articles, uncovered by a Belgian graduate student, Ortwin de Graef, in libraries there this summer, show the Belgian-born de Man wrote nearly 100 book reviews, concert notes and essays under his own name for Le Soir, an anti-Semitic Belgian newspaper that collaborated with the Nazis.</p>
        <p>At least one article by Professor de Man, entitled ''The Jews and Contemporary Literature'' strikes researchers as anti-Semitic, appearing in a special supplement on Jews in the March 4, 1941, edition of the paper. Next to the essay is a caricature of Jews with horns and claws who, wearing prayer shawls, pray that ''Jehovah will confound the gentiles.''</p>
        <p>''It shows the strength of our Western intellectuals that they could protect, from Jewish influence, a sphere as representative of the culture at large as literature,'' Professor de Man wrote. ''Despite the lingering Semitism in all our civilization, literature showed that its essential nature was healthy.''</p>
        <p>Prof. Raoul Hilberg, a Holocaust historian at the University of Vermont, said almost all educated Belgians knew by 1941 or at the latest, 1942, that Jews were being sent eastward to be exterminated.</p>
        <p>Some scholars said they detect anti-Nazi nuances in Professor de Man's favorable reviews of Jewish authors such as Kafka or the french historian Daniel Halevy. Others defended him as having been a young man, influenced perhaps by an uncle, Henri de Man, who was a minister in the collaborationist Belgian government, trying to protect Belgian autonomy against Nazi domination.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Man quit writing for the newspaper in 1942, entering publishing until he left for the United States in 1947, where he worked at various publishing and bookselling jobs. He became a graduate student at Harvard in 1952.</p>
        <p>Attempts to reach Professor de Man's widow, Patricia, whom he married in the United States, were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Ironically enough, the articles appear go to the heart of the ethical debates still raging over Dr. de Man's work at Yale, colleagues said.</p>
        <p>Critics of Professor de Man have labeled deconstructionism a nihilistic philosophy that makes moral or political beliefs impossible.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hertz, like other supporters of Dr. de Man, called the nihilism charge ''foolish,'' and said it is based on an oversimplification of Mr. de Man's theories. As did other scholars, he predicted Dr. de Man's personal and intellectual reputation would emerge unscathed.</p>
        <p>Professor de Man's colleagues have decided to publish the articles in a special issue of the Oxford Literary Review next year, and to solicit comment from about 50 scholars among those who both supported and opposed Professor de Man's work, Dr. Hertz said.</p>
