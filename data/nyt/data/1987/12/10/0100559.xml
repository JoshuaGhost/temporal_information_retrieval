        <p>LEAD: The front page of The Times this week rings with significance. The leaders of the two most powerful nations join for a historic meeting.

        <p>The front page of The Times this week rings with significance. The leaders of the two most powerful nations join for a historic meeting. All eyes are on them, and, one article said, hopes are soaring. But a different sort of hope soared at the bottom of the page Tuesday, in a tiny advertisement: ''JRS: The 30 days are over! I love you! Marry me! JDR.'' When Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan sit down together, the world can believe that perhaps even relentless tensions can be managed, and the possibility creates its own atmosphere. The event takes on such dimensions that it seems to overshadow all else.</p>
        <p>In fact, of course, it doesn't. Back when Mr. Gorbachev was running over in his mind the remarks he planned to make when he first stepped onto American soil, JDR was waiting, heart in hand, to hear what JRS would have to say. While the superpowers' leaders were signing the agreement doing away with short- and intermediate-range missiles, perhaps JRS and JDR reached an acceptable extension of their mysterious 30-day interim agreement. Indeed, even as the Gorbachevs and Reagans were sitting down to eat together, the would-be couple might well have been sitting down to work out a life together.</p>
        <p>From Aristotle to Hannah Arendt, wise and thoughtful people have noted a division of human concerns into private and public spheres. Certain individual needs are satisfied in the first sphere, other more common needs in the second. JDR's ad reminded the careful reader that amid the public hoopla, the private sphere went right on holding summit meetings of its own.</p>
        <p>The pull of romantic wishes is irresistible: Here's hoping Messrs. Reagan and Gorbachev agree; here's hoping that JRS says yes.</p>
