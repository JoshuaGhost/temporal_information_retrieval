        <p>LEAD: Senator David Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas, acknowledges that the Senate can be sluggish, unpredictable, inefficient and at times unproductive. But he is decidedly fond of the institution.</p>
        <p>Senator David Pryor, a Democrat from Arkansas, acknowledges that the Senate can be sluggish, unpredictable, inefficient and at times unproductive. But he is decidedly fond of the institution.</p>
        <p>''You do have personality here, and that is one of the great things about the Senate,'' asserted Mr. Pryor, who says he has labored for a half dozen years to find ways to tailor the chamber's rules to fit the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Lifting a 600-page black leather-bound volume of the Senate rules and bylaws, as if to blame it for paralysis in the 100th Congress on such issues as the budget, welfare revision, trade, housing and campaign finance, Mr. Pryor mused in his Capitol Hill office recently that the Senate ''sort of nurtures character.''</p>
        <p>''I think it is probably one of the greatest jobs and challenges,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he says, it is a body in dire need of some fixing. Which is why he prodded the leadership to establish a six-member ad hoc committee, of which he is a part, to consider ways the Senate can be improved.</p>
        <p>It as though he has taken on the Senate rules and procedures as a sort of Rubik's cube.</p>
        <p>''The Senate is a great place,'' he said. ''But the Senate is a place, right now, that reminds me of a huge giant lumbermill, with all the high technology and the biggest saws in the world, which is making toothpicks. Here in the Senate, we've kind of turned ourselves into a toothpick factory.''</p>
        <p>The Senator speaks from experience in both houses of Congress and in state government. Mr. Pryor, now 53 years old, had been elected to the Arkansas state legislature before he finished law school. He later served two terms in the House of Representatives and two terms as Governor. He was elected to the Senate in 1978.</p>
        <p>Experts on Congress and senators themselves acknowledge that the Senate has pondered itself exhaustively over the years.</p>
        <p>Among efforts mounted since the mid-1960's to streamline Senate procedures have been joint committees on the organization of the Congress, a commission on the operation of the Senate, select committees to study the Senate committee system and a two-member panel authorized to examine a wide range of rules and procedures in the Senate. Few of the attempts produced substantive change.</p>
        <p>The effort led by Mr. Pryor to bring efficiency to the Senate floor arose in part from complaints about irregular scheduling of votes and daily business, excessive workloads and a lack of discipline in which proceedings may be delayed through extended debates and votes on amendments that have no relation to bills receiving floor consideration. Productivity and Philosophy</p>
        <p>''While this is said to be the most exclusive club in the world, no one ever said it's the most productive,'' Mr. Pryor said.  He noted, however, that the Senate is philosophically different and the opposite of the House of Representatives, in which individual lawmakers must accommodate themselves to the chamber. ''Here 99 senators could be waiting for one Senator's plane to land,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Senate's foibles are ''sort of the sinew, the bone marrow that makes this place what it is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tilting back a bit in his chair, in an office eclectically decorated with the work of native artists of Arkansas and a velvet sofa once used by former Vice President Humphrey, Mr. Pryor said he had given the Rules Committee four proposals for amending the rules under which filibusters, roll-calls and other business are conducted. Big Rise in Filibusters</p>
        <p>Mr. Pryor notes that the Senate has ''endured more filibusters in the last 19 years than it did in the preceeding 127.'' (According to the Congressional Research Service, there have been 80 filibusters in the Senate since 1968, as against 62 filibusters from 1841 to 1968.) Mr. Pryor also notes that while the 99th Congress spent 2,531 hours in session and responded to 740 roll-call votes, the 93d Congress 12 years ago spent 500 fewer hours in session and held 400 more votes. This year, in the 100th Congress, lawmakers have already spent 1,118 hours in session and responded to 387 roll-call votes. One of his proposals would limit to two hours the time spent considering ''motions to proceed.'' This parliamentary technique was used 12 times in the 99th Congress to delay floor consideration of pending legislation.</p>
        <p>Another proposal would strictly limit roll-call votes to 15 minutes. Another would prohibit offering of ''sense of the Senate'' amendments unless they first garnered 20 co-sponsors. And yet another of Mr. Pryor's proposals would allow the introduction of amendments only when relevant sections of a bill were being debated. Scheduling Idea Accepted</p>
        <p>On the scheduling issue, Mr. Pryor said the leadership had accepted the ad hoc committee's suggestion that, starting in 1988, for every month that the Senate is in session, it will work three weeks and then have a week off. Mr. Pryor said the proposal would offer continuity and streamline the committee system, which he said has been plagued by an inability ot get quorums at least two days out of every week.</p>
        <p>The Senator confessed to sometimes ''feeling like an old sourpuss'' for beating about on the matter of rules and procedures. But even then the assessment comes with optimism.</p>
        <p>''I have a sense that things are about to change,'' he said. ''I think most of the members of the Senate want to be proud of the Senate, and right now, well, we're not very proud of it. Finally it has dawned on us that we're the only ones who can change it.''</p>
