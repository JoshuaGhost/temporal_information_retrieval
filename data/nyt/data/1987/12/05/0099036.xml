        <p>LEAD: With many Korean and foreign experts sensing that his campaign has stalled, the ruling party's presidential candidate, Roh Tae Woo, went to unusual lengths tonight to distance himself from South Korea's unpopular President, Chun Doo Hwan.</p>
        <p>With many Korean and foreign experts sensing that his campaign has stalled, the ruling party's presidential candidate, Roh Tae Woo, went to unusual lengths tonight to distance himself from South Korea's unpopular President, Chun Doo Hwan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh, although an old friend and army colleague of Mr. Chun, has been running against the present authoritarian Government since the campaign began, saying that it has committed torture and other ''mistakes,'' and pledging that his presidency would be different.</p>
        <p>In a nationally televised speech tonight, Mr. Roh brought this style of running to full gallop when he indirectly touched on a taboo subject - financial scandals involving the South Korean President and his family.</p>
        <p>''It is my belief that in eradicating corruption, no one should be exempted, including the head of state,'' he said. ''If there is any exception in the course of eradicating corruption, our efforts to build a just society will fail.'' Issue of Corruption</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh never mentioned Mr. Chun by name, let alone attacked him straight on. Nevertheless, the reference to the incumbent President was unmistakable for South Koreans.</p>
        <p>Over the last seven years, allegations of financial misconduct have surfaced several times, involving relatives of Mr. Chun's wife, Lee Soon Ja, and his own brother, Chun Kyung Hwan, head of an important agricultural program called the Saemaul Movement.</p>
        <p>While corruption here is not thought to have reached the level of plunder attributed to, say, Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines, it has been both a liability and a sore point for Mr. Chun. The subject is so sensitive that South Korean newspapers and opposition politicians tend not to make much of the issue in public out of fear of inviting swift retaliation by the authorities. Nevertheless, the scandals remain on many minds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh said in his campaign speech tonight that morality must begin at the top. Dramatic Gestures Cited</p>
        <p>''The upper strata should voluntarily get rid of corruption,'' he said. ''They say that where the upper stream is clean, so is the lower stream.''</p>
        <p>His wife, he added, in an apparent attempt to make a distinction between himself and the entire Chun family, ''will be a model housewife, escept that she will be active in voluntary work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh's decision to make something of a whipping boy out of the military-installed Government to which he belongs apparently reflects a belief that he has lost momentum and needs dramatic gestures to recapture it.</p>
        <p>''Roh Tae Woo is losing ground,'' a Western diplomat said. ''He should be further along than he is if he's the Government candidate. He's got all the tools. Why is he not better off than he is?'' Slipping Against Opposition</p>
        <p>While it is extremely difficult to determine whether any opinion polls here are fully reliable - they may not even be published - some surveys show Mr. Roh to be slipping against the major opposition candidates, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam.</p>
        <p>This was the conclusion of an unpublished national poll taken last weekend by a church-affiliated group, the Christian Institute for the Study of Justice and Development. In this sampling of 1,497 respondents, Kim Dae Jung led with 26.8 percent of the vote, Kim Young Sam followed with 23.4 percent and Roh Tae Woo lagged well behind with 18.9 percent. A similar poll taken a month earlier showed them to be in a dead heat.</p>
        <p>Five other candidates shared 7.7 percent among them, while a large group, 23.2 percent, said they were undecided or unwilling to give an opinion.</p>
        <p>The organization that took the survey is strongly sympathetic to the political oppositions. Still, even if the precise numbers are debatable, the trend it suggests - that of Mr. Roh faltering, especially to Kim Dae Jung's advantage - is shared by neutral observers and even Roh partisans. An 'Ordinary Man,' Roh Says</p>
        <p>A National Assemblyman from the Government party acknowledged there was some concern in the ruling camp, although he insisted that Mr. Roh was in the lead. ''He's doing all right, but not as well as expected,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roh's strategy has been to present himself as an ''ordinary man,'' who brought democratic progress to South Korea by agreeing last June 29 to opposition demands for a direct presidential election. Before that surrender, as he himself calls it, he had expected to ascend to the presidency as Mr. Chun's handpicked successor.</p>
        <p>But he must always contend with the political liability created by his military background and the fact that he took part in a 1980 coup that made Mr. Chun President. So even while he talks of his military backgound with pride, he increasingly is trying to walk away from it, and from Mr. Chun.</p>
        <p>''The more explicit he becomes, the more scared he probably is,'' the Western diplomat said.</p>
        <p>It is not clear if Mr. Chun accepts this strategy and endorses it. But he was reported the other day in South Korean newspapers as being furious with aides because Mr. Roh's crowds at rallies were not as large as he had wished. The story, if true, suggested he still wanted his old ally to win.</p>
