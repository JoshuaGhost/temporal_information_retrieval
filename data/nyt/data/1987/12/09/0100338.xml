        <p>A SOVIET joke of the kind President Reagan likes to collect tells of the May Day parade in Red Square, with the usual array of troops, tanks and missiles. Then along comes a flat-bed truck carrying three men in business suits. ''Who are they?'' an American visitor asks his Soviet guide. The guide explains: ''They are our most powerful weapon. They are the economists. They can destroy an entire nation.''</p>
        <p>But Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, seems to feel that economists can also revive a faltering nation and he has brought to the summit meeting three of his most influential ones: Abel G. Abanbegyan, the top economic adviser to Mr. Gorbachev; Vladimir M. Kamentsev, the top Soviet trade official, and Stepan Sitaryan, deputy chief of the Soviet State Planning Commission.</p>
        <p>The Russians have been discussing their problems and goals with their American counterparts, and W. Allen Wallis, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said in an interview this week that the Soviet economists had been ''candid about the difficulties they are facing.''</p>
        <p>One of their major goals is to step up their growth rate to 4.2 to 4.4 percent and keep it there until the year 2000. In the last five years growth has averaged little more than 2 percent and this year, according to Central Intelligence Agency estimates, growth was a bare 1.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallis told the Soviet visitors that he feared their growth goals were inconsistent with their plans for reconstructing the Soviet economy and ''would not work.'' He finds them unable to recognize the difficulties of partly decontrolling prices and partly leaving them controlled. Robert Clarke, deputy director for economics of the Soviet desk at the State Department, said reconstructing the Soviet economy would require large shifts of labor to new jobs for which training would be required, relocating managers and letting workers elect their own managers, modernizing equipment and meeting ambitious goals of industrial retooling. All that, he suggested, would involve ''a lot of down time'' and would curb the acceleration of growth.</p>
        <p>On their side, the Soviet economists have doubts about the performance of the American economy. Two topics they have raised most often are the stock market collapse and the budget deficit.</p>
        <p>The Americans generally find their Soviet counterparts eager to expand economic relations with the United States, although somewhat less sophisticated than the Chinese economists whom they have met. The Russians, in their view, underrate the importance of free prices and open markets for furthering productive efficiency, allocation of resources and furthering economic growth. As one American economist observed, ''The Chinese do not think it beneath their dignity to invite Western economists to help them - they are willing to admit they have a lot to learn.''</p>
        <p>The Russians have indicated their hopes of making the ruble a convertible currency and said they would begin this effort with the Eastern bloc in Europe. They have expressed strong interest in developing joint ventures with American companies and indicated willingness to modify their rule of not permitting American or other foreign companies to own more than 49 percent of a joint venture.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wallis noted that the Soviet Union appeared chiefly interested in joint ventures to develop exports and get Western technology, while American companies were more interested in manufacturing and selling goods in the Soviet home market, not just for export.</p>
        <p>The Americans with whom they have met say the Russians have not brought up the question of obtaining American credits. ''They have a hard currency and a good credit rating,'' Mr. Clarke said, ''and they do not want to get in the kind of bind that the Eastern European countries have. They have a large resource base and tons of gold.''</p>
        <p>What the Americans are hoping for is not a dramatic breakthrough on the economic side but a series of relatively small concrete agreements -on civil aviation, marine transportation, maritime boundaries in the Pacific, law of the sea, expanded American sales of grain, and, for Moscow, expanded textile sales and increased access to the United States market. And the Americans appear to agree that these talks, in relaxing tensions, can be ''very significant in building the confidence that will mean expanded economic relations.''</p>
        <p>Despite the stock market collapse, the Russians have given the overall impression that they think capitalism is not doing too badly and has elements worth emulating. They know, as well as the Americans, that where, in the 1960's and 1970's, the Soviet Union seemed to be catching up, it has, since 1975, been falling further and further behind.</p>
