        <p>LEAD: The Brooklyn District Attorney has asserted that a New York City judge ordered the complainant in a sexual misconduct trial to get on the floor on her hands and knees, as the defendant and others watched, to demonstrate her position when she was attacked.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn District Attorney has asserted that a New York City judge ordered the complainant in a sexual misconduct trial to get on the floor on her hands and knees, as the defendant and others watched, to demonstrate her position when she was attacked.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent yesterday to a judicial committee, the District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman, said that ''the most serious disciplinary measures'' should be taken against the judge involved, Irving W. Levine of Civil Court in Brooklyn. Ms. Holtzman made the letter public.</p>
        <p>''A judge who degrades a victim of a sexual assault is not fit for the bench,'' she said in the letter.</p>
        <p>Judge Levine, who is 59 years old and was elected to a 10-year term as a Civil Court judge in November 1983, did not respond to messages left with court employees. Defendant Found Not Guilty</p>
        <p>According to the prosecutor, the judge, who was sitting in a nonjury trial in Criminal Court in Brooklyn, where he is on temporary assignment, had the woman demonstrate the position in a room adjacent to the courtroom because he was not satisfied with aspects of her testimony.</p>
        <p>The complainant had testified that after she had been robbed and while she was being sexually assaulted, she was able to see the defendant standing next to a window with money in his hand. Three men were said to be involved in the incident, but apparently just one was apprehended and brought to trial.</p>
        <p>Judge Levine found the defendant not guilty of the sole charge of which he was accused, sexual misconduct, a misdemeanor.</p>
        <p>The assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case did not protest the judge's action when it occurred, Sept. 28, and did not, until recently, report the case to superiors in Ms. Holtzman's office, according to a spokesman for the office, Glenn S. Goldberg.</p>
        <p>As a result, the assistant, whose name was not been made public, has been transferred out of the bureau that handles prosecutions for sex crimes, Mr. Goldberg said.</p>
        <p>''It was felt the move was in the best interests of the office,'' Mr. Goldberg said. Records of Case Ordered Sealed</p>
        <p>Because the records of the case have been sealed by court order, as is the practice in acquittals, Mr. Goldberg said the District Attorney's office could not disclose the name or sex of the prosecutor or any other information about the case that went beyond what was in the District Attorney's letter of complaint.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holtzman's letter was sent by messenger to the administrative judge of New York City Family Court, Kathryn McDonald, in her capacity as chairwoman of the Committee to Implement Recommendations of the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts. The committee, appointed by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, has no disciplinary powers. A spokesman for the</p>
        <p>State Office of Court Administration, Harold Wolfe, said Judge McDonald had received the letter and would review it.</p>
        <p>The District Attorney's office said another letter on the incident would be sent to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which has the authority to discipline and, in the most serious instances, remove judges. 'Very Detailed Questions'</p>
        <p>In her letter to Judge McDonald describing what she characterized as Judge Levine's ''egregious behavior,'' Ms. Holtzman said in part: ''During the trial, the victm, an adult woman, testified that the defendant and two others acting in concert had first taken money from her. Afterwards, she was forced to the floor on her hands and knees and sexually assaulted from the rear. The victim also testified that during the sexual assault she was able to see under her left arm the defendant standing next to a window with money in his hand.</p>
        <p>''On cross-examination, the victim was subjected to very detailed questions about the position she was in that enabled her to see the defendant.</p>
        <p>''Judge Levine also asked the victim several questions about her position. Claiming not to be satisfied with the answers, Judge Levine asked the assistant district attorney, defense counsel, defendant, court officer and court reporter to join him in the robing room, where the judge then asked the victim to get down on the floor and show the position she was in when she was being sexually assaulted and saw the defendant. The victim stared at the judge in disbelief, but he repeated his direction and the victim reluctantly got down on her hands and her knees as everyone stood and watched.</p>
        <p>''In making the victim assume the position she was forced to take when she was sexually assaulted, Judge Levine profoundly degraded, humiliated and demeaned her. Making her relive the anguish of the experience so graphically and forcing her to do so before a group of strangers including the defendant, one of the very people she believed responsible for the sexual assault, exposed the witness to extreme psychological pain. In addition, such conduct can convert a judicial proceeding designed to determine the truth of a serious criminal charge into an avenue for inappropriate sexual titillation.''</p>
