        <p>LEAD: Ending Wall Street's three-day rally, stock prices fell sharply late yesterday after a seesaw session that reflected unexpectedly bad news on the trade front.</p>
        <p>Ending Wall Street's three-day rally, stock prices fell sharply late yesterday after a seesaw session that reflected unexpectedly bad news on the trade front.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 47.08 points, or 2.47 percent, to 1,855.44. In the three previous sessions, the Dow, which is made up of 30 stocks of the nation's premier corporations, had surged 135.78 points, raising hopes that the stock market had bottomed out last week when it slipped to its levels of the ''October massacre.''</p>
        <p>But before the opening of trading yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit swelled to a record $17.6 billion in October, 25.3 percent higher than the $14.1 billion imbalance in merchandise trade recorded in September. The trade figures stunned experts, many of whom had predicted an October deficit in the $14 billion range. Trade Imbalance Primary Force</p>
        <p>The trade imbalance has been cited as a primary force behind the dollar's long slide and the stock market's steep decline since summer.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's trade news sent the dollar plunging to its lowest levels in more than 40 years. And in the credit markets, prices of Treasury bonds plummeted, pushing up yields sharply, although short-term interest rates held firm as investors bought short-term Treasury bills in a ''flight to quality.''</p>
        <p>With the dismal trade figures in hand, many stock traders predicted that the Dow would fall sharply at the opening bell. And, indeed, it plunged more than 49 points in the first 15 minutes. Recovery Surprises Many</p>
        <p>But then, in trading that surprised many people, the stock market recovered, and the Dow even managed a gain in the early afternoon. The market was apparently bolstered when short-sellers, who had made a tidy profit in the opening plunge, closed out their positions by buying stocks, and by bargain hunters, who snapped up economically sensitive paper and chemical stocks.</p>
        <p>Gold and silver stocks also moved up as the price of gold for December delivery climbed $7.80, to $492.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. ASA Ltd., for example, rose 2 5/8, to 52 3/8.</p>
        <p>''All we're doing is focusing on short-term trading opportunities,'' said Henry M. Greenleaf Jr., president of HT Investors Inc., a money manager in Providence, R.I. ''Near term, you have a bear market. You'd better treat it like a bear market. But you can trade in a bear market.''</p>
        <p>Traders said that early stock losses were also minimized because many foreign investors, concerned about the dollar's volatility, had already pulled out of the market. A Decline in Tokyo</p>
        <p>In Friday morning trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks, which rose 1.7 percent yesterday before the trade figures were released, fell by one-half of 1 percent, or 141.99 points, to 23,138.85.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's trading in London, where traders had time to digest the American trade figures, share prices finished lower in turbulent trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 19.7 points, a little more than 1 percent, to close at 1,619.6. The index had been up 18.3 points before the American trade figures were released. It then plunged 54 points before rebounding.</p>
        <p>The American stock market rally held its own until about 3:30 P.M. In the last 30 minutes of trading, investors bailed out of stocks. Many of them were unwilling to carry positions into the uncertainty of today. In the past, there has often been a delayed reaction to dismal trade figures, with big stock selloffs coming several days after the original announcement.</p>
        <p>Some investors surmised that late program trading might have been a factor in yesterday's late decline, but traders on the floor said that was not the case.</p>
        <p>The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.49 points, to 131.07, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5.32, to 233.57. Volume on the Big Board was 189 million shares, down from 231.4 million on Wednesday, as 1,085 stocks fell and 512 rose. I.B.M. Down 3, to 111</p>
        <p>Among individual stocks, I.B.M. dropped 3, to 111. The recent lackluster performance of I.B.M., a bellwether stock, has worried some traders.</p>
        <p>Other blue-chip losers included General Motors, off 2 1/8, to 57 1/2; Ford 2 3/8, to 73 1/4, and Merck 2 1/4, to 159.</p>
        <p>Outboard Marine rose 2 7/8, to 23 1/8, and USG 2 7/8, to 31, on separate takeover speculation.</p>
        <p>TW Services jumped 2 1/2, to 15. An investor group led by Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon, said it might seek control of the company.</p>
        <p>In over-the-counter trading, Intel dipped 1 1/2, to 24, after I.B.M. sold its remaining stake in the company. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues fell 1.14, to 300.81.</p>
        <p>The American Stock Exchange market-value index eased 0.16, to 241.04. It had been up most of the day, buoyed by the many mining issues on the Amex.</p>
