        <p>LEAD: A three-year struggle to save the Western Union Corporation has come to a successful end.</p>
        <p>A three-year struggle to save the Western Union Corporation has come to a successful end.</p>
        <p>Western Union said yesterday that its bondholders had approved a debt exchange that would complete a long-sought restructuring of the troubled telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>The debt exchange was the last hurdle in the race by the company to complete its restructuring plan before the end of the year. Under the debt exchange, the company's bondholders voted to swap their old securities for two new classes of preferred stock in the company, which merged with its chief subsidiary, the Western Union Telegraph Company. Tax Benefits Cited</p>
        <p>Western Union for months had warned that the company would be forced into filing for bankruptcy protection if debt holders failed to agree to exchange their debentures for stock in the restructured company.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that Western Union would have lost tax benefits crucial to its survival if the restructuring was not completed by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Under the restructuring, Bennett S. LeBow, the New York financier and controlling stockholder, will invest $25 million in Western Union in return for shares representing 53 percent of the company's voting stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. LeBow will use $500 million in financing provided by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to buy ITT World Communications, a division of the ITT Corporation that operates a telex service, for $161 million. The division will be merged with Western Union, which is the primary provider of telex services in the United States. ITT is a strong international carrier.  Mr. LeBow will also pay off Western Union's $142 million of bank debt. The remainder of the money raised will be used for working capital and to cover restructuring expenses, the company said.</p>
        <p>With the approval of the exchange offer, Western Union ends one of the most troubled restructurings in corporate history. Over the last three years, the company has negotiated for 15 extensions of its bank loan agreements amid losses of about $1 billion. Even yesterday's vote on the debt exchange came after several extensions.</p>
        <p>A venerable 135-year-old name of American industry, Western Union had a monopoly on the telegram service in the United States for much of its history. By the 1980's, the company began diversifying into other businesses, including cellular telephones and buying a 50 percent stake in Airfone Inc., which provides telephone service for airplane passengers.</p>
        <p>The company also began its Easylink electronic mail service, which had been losing millions of dollars until recently. The service began operating profitably in the last year, the company said. Those losses contributed heavily to the company's financial crisis. Adding to its woes, in late 1984 a group of Western Union's lenders cut off a $100 million line of credit. Others Have Been Interested</p>
        <p>Over the years, several companies - including Citicorp, General Motors and MCI - have considered acquiring Western Union or some of its operations, only to change their minds after taking a closer look.</p>
        <p>After the restructuring, Western Union will be somewhat different. Having sold its interest in Airfone and its cellular systems, the company will now be divided into five business groups. The largest of the groups will be business communications services, which includes the company's telex operations, Easylink and ITT World Communications.</p>
        <p>The other groups are consumer communications and financial services, which include the company's money-transfer, Mailgram and telegram services; priority mail; advanced transmissions systems, which construct and operates fiber optic cable facilities, and network services.</p>
        <p>Some analysts predicted that the company would undergo extensive changes in the next several years, although they offered no specific forecasts of what acquisitions or divestitures the company might make.</p>
        <p>''The shareholders are, to a large extent, betting on the business acumen of the new group,'' Harry Rosenthal, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. ''I think there will be more buying and selling of units. We haven't seen the last of that. I can't believe that they simply want to run the old Western Union as it is.''</p>
