        <p>LEAD: The dollar surged to its highest levels in almost six weeks yesterday, propelled by a wave of Japanese buying and a continued rise in interest rates in the United States.</p>
        <p>The dollar surged to its highest levels in almost six weeks yesterday, propelled by a wave of Japanese buying and a continued rise in interest rates in the United States.</p>
        <p>Most of the gains occurred overnight in Tokyo, where Japanese corporations and trust banks covered short positions in advance of the close of their fiscal year today. In short covering, dollars must be bought to replace those sold earlier in anticipation of a decline.</p>
        <p>''There was a tendency for some position squaring in the Far East,'' said the chief foreign-exchange trader at a major New York money center bank. ''It is a very technical move, but it has caused everybody to become very bullish.''</p>
        <p>Masakazu Miyamori, chief currency trader at the Sanwa Bank in New York, said: ''Most Japanese corporations had been waiting to cover their short positions because they had expected the dollar to go lower. Now there is not much time to do that before the end of the year, so they started to buy dollars.''</p>
        <p>By late in the day in New York, the dollar was bid at 146.60 yen, more than 2 yen higher than Monday's close. It was the highest the dollar has been against the yen since Aug. 18.</p>
        <p>The dollar also made strong gains against major European currencies such as the West German mark.</p>
        <p>The dollar rose nearly 2 pfennings from Monday's close, to a late bid of 1.8415 marks. And it moved nearly 2 centimes higher against the Swiss franc, to a bid of 1.5300 in New York.</p>
        <p>Gold prices fell. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted bullion at $458.60 an ounce, down $1.45 from Monday's figure.</p>
        <p>Aside from the short-covering aspect of yesterday's rally, American traders said the dollar's performance reflected a delayed reaction to the reaffirmation of officials representing the Group of Seven to maintain exchange rate stability.</p>
        <p>Before last weekend's Group of Seven meeting, traders in New York had expected the officials to agree to another coordinated decline in the dollar as a way of helping to solve America's continuing trade problems. The seven nations are the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
        <p>''On Monday it seemed very clear that the dollar had to go lower,'' said Jim McGroarty, head of the foreign-exchange desk at the Discount Corporation of New York. ''But when the dollar didn't fall at all on Monday, that unnerved people.''</p>
        <p>Gold bullion fell sharply in thin trading dominated by professionals. In London the metal fell to $459.50 an ounce from Monday's $461.90. In Zurich gold fell to $460 an ounce from $462.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped to $458.95 from $461.83.</p>
        <p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell to $458 an ounce, from $460 on Monday.</p>
