        <p>LEAD: A Delaware judge ruled today that Consolidated Gold Fields P.L.C. may not use recently purchased shares of the Newmont Mining Corporation to vote on the proposed takeover of Newmont by the Texas investor T. Boone Pickens.</p>
        <p>A Delaware judge ruled today that Consolidated Gold Fields P.L.C. may not use recently purchased shares of the Newmont Mining Corporation to vote on the proposed takeover of Newmont by the Texas investor T. Boone Pickens.</p>
        <p>But the judge let Consolidated Gold Fields, Newmont's ally and largest shareholder, retain ownership of the 15.6 million shares. The purchases last week increased its Newmont stake to 49.9 percent from 26.2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Pickens group had asked that the purchases be invalidated.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs of the Delaware Chancery Court also said that the Pickens group, Ivanhoe Partners, could take no action in its bid, other than to extend its deadline of next Monday.</p>
        <p>The judge said Consolidated Gold Fields should either have the shares put into escrow or not vote them.</p>
        <p>The court allowed the unusual arrangement because Consolidated Gold Fields had argued that a financial calamity would result if the share purchases were invalidated. The ruling will remain in effect at least until Thursday, when another hearing on the matter is set.</p>
