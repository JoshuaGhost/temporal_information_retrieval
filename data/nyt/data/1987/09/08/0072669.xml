        <p>LEAD: The abso lute truth about the fight that took place in the lobby of Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital on the morning of Aug. 26 will probably never be known.</p>
        <p>The abso lute truth about the fight that took place in the lobby of Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital on the morning of Aug. 26 will probably never be known.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that the Mount Scopus branch of Hadassah quickly dismissed a bright young Israeli Arab gynecologist for striking a Jewish security guard with his briefcase. The confrontation has left many Israeli Arabs and Jews angry and disturbed.</p>
        <p>The case has also saddened many people here because those involved, both the Jews and the Arabs, were people long committed to coexistence, but who now find themselves bitterly at odds. It also reinforces how quickly in Israel the simplest crime, confrontation or even accident involving a Jew and an Arab can explode into a political storm.</p>
        <p>At the center of this storm is 30-year-old Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab from the northern village of Taibe. Dr. Tibi received his B.A. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and his medical degree from Hadassah Medical School, where he was first in his class of Arabs and Jews. Before the incident, Dr. Tibi, a Moslem, was in the third year of his residency at Hadassah Mount Scopus. Ever-Present Security</p>
        <p>As in any hospital department, Dr. Tibi said, he had his friends and his enemies. He said some took pride in his success as a doctor and others - who he said saw him as an ''uppity Arab'' -thought he was just a little too smart for his own good.</p>
        <p>On the morning of Aug. 26, Dr. Tibi said, he came to the hospital as usual, carrying his briefcase. As at all major public institutions in Israel, Hadassah Hospital has a security guard who checks those entering for weapons. On Aug. 26, a newly hired, and recent American immigrant, David Rothstein, was on duty in the guard booth.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Tibi, he whisked past the guard station, a common practice, assuming the guard recognized him. Instead the guard shouted, ''Hey, let me see your briefcase.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tibi said he turned around and told the guard, ''I am a doctor here,'' and then continued walking. At that point, Mr. Rothstein left his post, grabbed Dr. Tibi's briefcase by the handle, slightly cutting one of the doctor's fingers. As onlookers stared, the two men struggled over the valise. Conflicting Accounts</p>
        <p>''Easy man,'' Dr. Tibi said he told the guard, ''I am a doctor here.''</p>
        <p>From there on accounts diverge. According to Dr. Tibi, the guard responded: ''For me, every Arab is a terrorist. Open your briefcase.'' Ruth Mekel, the spokeswoman for Hadassah, who is handling all inquiries about the case, denied that the guard said this. She said the guard did not even know Dr. Tibi was an Arab and all he said to him was: ''I don't know you. Anyone whom I don't know might be a terrorist.''</p>
        <p>In any event, Dr. Tibi felt that he was being called a terrorist and the perceived insult enraged him. Struggle Over Briefcase</p>
        <p>Dr. Tibi said he shouted at the guard: ''Fool, how can you call me a terrorist! I am a doctor here.'' After the two men struggled over the briefcase for a few more moments, the guard's superior arrived, identified the doctor and instructed that he be released. Dr. Tibi said that as they disengaged the guard tried to slap him across the mouth. Ms. Mekel said the guard denies this.</p>
        <p>But everyone agrees about what happened next. Boiling with anger, Dr. Tibi swung his briefcase and hit Mr. Rothstein on the side of his head, opening up a cut that bled profusely and required four stitches to close. Then Dr. Tibi stalked off, leaving the injured guard lying on the floor.</p>
        <p>''My national background was insulted,'' he explained. ''There is only so much you can swallow.'' Dismissal Ordered Same Day</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Mekel, about an hour later, the hospital director, Dr. Jacques Michel gathered some of the witnesses, as well as Dr. Tibi and the guard, and interviewed each of them individually.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, Dr. Michel ordered Dr. Tibi's dismissal.</p>
        <p>Asked why Dr. Michel had taken such a serious step without a formal inquiry, Ms. Mekel said: ''Dr. Michel felt that what Dr. Tibi did in striking the guard, and then just walking away as he bled, was such a grave and violent act for a doctor that he had to be immediately dismissed from the hospital. Such behavior simply cannot be tolerated. It had absolutely nothing to do with his being an Arab.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tibi said he had heard of at least two other cases where Jewish doctors had struck other staff in the operating room, while patients were on the table, and no similar disciplinary action was taken. Ms. Mekel said she was not aware of any such incidents. Asked to Apologize</p>
        <p>After getting a dismissal letter, Dr. Tibi called his old friend Ezer Weizman, Minister Without Portfolio, who made his own inquiries. This apparently prompted Hadassah to grant the doctor a more formal hearing.</p>
        <p>At midnight Aug. 27, Dr. Tibi said he was telephoned and told that the next morning the hospital disciplinary committee would examine his case.</p>
        <p>''This is accepted procedure,'' said Ms. Mekel of holding an inquiry after a doctor had already been dismissed. ''A wider scope of doctors from different hospital committees wanted to review the case.''</p>
        <p>At the hearing, Dr. Tibi said he was asked if he would, in writing, express his regret to the hospital for what he did. He agreed. Then he said he was asked if he would apologize to the guard for hitting him. Dr. Tibi said that at first he said no, but then consented in order to save his job. More Conflicting Accounts</p>
        <p>But Ms. Mekel said the Israeli Arab doctor refused to apologize, and as a result the disciplinary committee reaffirmed his dismissal.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Dr. Michel granted Dr. Tibi another private hearing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tibi said, ''I told him I did not want to see Hadassah's good name dragged through the press and that I would gladly publicly express my regret for the incident, if he would just give me back my job.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Mekel denied that Dr. Tibi offered to apologize.</p>
        <p>''She is lying,'' said Dr. Tibi, ''I will repeat the offer publicly right now.'' Promoters of Coexistence</p>
        <p>In any event, Dr. Michel refused to rescind the dismissal order. Dr. Tibi has now turned the case over to his Israeli lawyers.</p>
        <p>What makes this affair, being reported extensively by the Israeli papers, so wrenching is that it is between people who are usually aligned politically. Few institutions in Israel have done more to promote Arab-Jewish coexistence than Hadassah Hospital, which has a long record of treating and training Arabs and Jews.</p>
        <p>''How could anyone think that we would be biased?'' Ms. Mekel asked indignantly.</p>
        <p>This is also true for Dr. Tibi, a longtime activist for Arab-Jewish coexistence, whose many Jewish friends and patients have rallied to his cause.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be a media hero,'' he said, in a voice laden with sadness. ''I don't want to be an Arab national hero, and I don't want to fight Hadassah. I am a good citizen. I regret that I got so carried away, but I have my dignity and I was insulted. Now I just want my job back.''</p>
