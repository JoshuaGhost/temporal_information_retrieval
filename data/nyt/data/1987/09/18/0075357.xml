        <p>LEAD: With the archery seasons for deer opening Sept. 26 in New Jersey and Sept. 27 in New York State's northern zone, those who prefer this more difficult form of hunting may wish to attend a bow-hunter jamboree at the Garden State Archery Range in Jacobstown, N.J., Sept. 20.</p>
        <p>With the archery seasons for deer opening Sept. 26 in New Jersey and Sept. 27 in New York State's northern zone, those who prefer this more difficult form of hunting may wish to attend a bow-hunter jamboree at the Garden State Archery Range in Jacobstown, N.J., Sept. 20.</p>
        <p>Organized by New Jersey's State Field Archery Association, the affair is billed as a tune-up for opening day. There will be two ranges and 56 three-dimensional animal targets arranged to simulate actual hunting conditions. Refreshments will be available, and archery retailers will be on hand for those who need new equipment. The United Bowhunters of New Jersey will staff an information and membership booth. The registration fee is $8. For more information, call Ralph DiTillio at (609) 443-6683, or Rick Fawley at (215) 322-7288.</p>
        <p>New Jersey archers have many opportunities to put venison in the freezer. In the fall bow season (Sept. 26-Nov. 6), hunters may take two deer of either sex, no more than one per day. If they are lucky enough to draw a permit, they may do the same in the special bow season which runs Nov. 7 to Dec. 5 (excluding Nov. 26), and they have a third chance at taking two more animals - with or without antlers - in the winter (Jan. 2-18) bow season. In addition to the six-day firearms season for shotguns or muzzle-loading rifles, New Jersey also has separate special permit seasons for each class of those weapons.</p>
        <p>In New York, the archery season is Sept. 27-Oct. 23 in the northern zone, and Oct. 15-Nov. 15 in the southern. In Westchester and Suffolk counties, only archers may hunt deer, and the seasons, in the same order, are Nov. 1-Dec. 31 and Nov. 9-Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>This year, New York State archers who are successful in their special seasons will be allowed, with some exceptions, to take a second animal by bow and arrow during the modern firearms seasons. The second animal must have horns at least three inches long, except in deer management units 66 and 96, where antlerless deer are legal game to all hunters. Those archers who take deer during the Suffolk and Westchester seasons are excluded from this provision, although those who take their first deer elsewhere may try again in either of those two counties. A final exception is that an archer who kills a deer before Oct. 1 in the northern zone is not eligible to apply for a permit to take a second. The special second-deer permit may be obtained by mail (it could take three weeks to obtain a permit in this manner) or by applying in person at various Department of Environmental Conservation offices. It costs $10.50.</p>
        <p>For whatever such prognostications are worth, an article in the first issue of Aqua-Field Publications' ''Nikon World of Big Game Hunting,'' which is scheduled to reach newstands in a few weeks, predicts that this year's deer hunting will be the most productive in the nation's history. The author, Russell Tinsley, bases his conclusions on interviews with game biologists from coast to coast.</p>
        <p>If you are a neophyte fly fisherman yearning to know more about the sport, joining the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited would be a good way to start and to aid the organization's ongoing conservation and stream improvement efforts. You might begin rubbing elbows with the experts by attending the chapter's annual dinner on Nov. 14 at the Lakeover Country Club in Bedford Hills, N.Y., where the guest speaker will be Dick Talleur, an angler, fly tyer and author, who was also the group's first president. The chapter's meetings - always open to the public - are held at the Fox Lane Middle School in Bedford at 7:30 P.M. on the third Tuesday of each month from September to May, and each winter the chapter conducts a school in fly tying. Its address is P.O. Box 186, Bedford Hills, N.Y. 10507.</p>
        <p>This year's annual dinner party and auction to benefit the American Museum of Fly Fishing will be Oct. 1 at the Wampanoag Country Club in West Hartford, Conn. Admission is $35 a person, $60 a couple. One may mail a reservation request and a check to Elmer Latham, the American Museum of Fly Fishing, 79 Northfield Road, Coventry, Conn. 06238, or call (203) 742-6584 for more information.</p>
        <p>The museum, which was incorporated as a nonprofit educational institution in 1968, moved into its present building in Manchester, Vt. in 1983, where exhibits dealing with fly fishing's history may be seen.</p>
        <p>The auction includes sporting art, fly rods, reels and lines and a day of guided fishing in Montana with Bud Lilly.</p>
