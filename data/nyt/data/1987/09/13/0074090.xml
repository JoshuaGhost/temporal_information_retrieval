        <p>LEAD: IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER the bloom went off the Moscow summer, and in the streets adjacent to the Pushkin Museum amber lamplight shone behind tall windows set in pale yellow facades. The morning was dark and dank, but people were standing five and six abreast in a line that snaked around the museum for 100 yards and more.</p>
        <p>IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER the bloom went off the Moscow summer, and in the streets adjacent to the Pushkin Museum amber lamplight shone behind tall windows set in pale yellow facades. The morning was dark and dank, but people were standing five and six abreast in a line that snaked around the museum for 100 yards and more. In an exhibition mounted in short order to mark the centenary of his birth, Marc Chagall's work was back in town and in bulk after many, many years, and no one in Moscow was put off by the weather.</p>
        <p>Once inside, Soviet visitors wheeled this way and that in wordless absorption, leaving it to a large foreign contingent to cackle the hours away. With 254 items - paintings, etchings and lithographs - in the catalogue, there was a lot to take in. Many of Chagall's early paintings had a direct, factual, unsentimental quality that came across to the visitor in a candid, unmediated way. Here and there, there was fantasy. A little town in nowhere became the locus of mysterious, implausible and unprecedented goings-on. But, even then, Chagall dished up the facts of provincial life in a way that is still valid today. Chagall, a native of Vitebsk, went to Paris in 1911, returned to Russia soon after the outbreak of World War I and remained there throught the first years of the Revolution. Despite his initial readiness to help build a new society, he was disenchanted by the experience and left the Soviet Union permanently for the West in 1922.</p>
        <p>Thanks to careful editing, the exhibition contained very few of the paintings in which Chagall sometimes let sweet sentiment carry him away. The 51 etchings made in Paris for Gogol's novel ''Dead Souls,'' dated 1923-27, make an exhibition in themselves, with the kind of bite, snap and concision that calls for long and close looking. In the coverage of the period from 1906 to 1922 there was a memorably strong, lean and unhackneyed contribution from Soviet sources, both public and private.</p>
        <p>First mooted in 1973, the exhibition had the support of Chagall's second wife, Vava, and of his daughter by his first marriage, Ida. (Both of them live in France.) Thanks to the informed and effective enthusiasm of Irina Antonova, the director of the Pushkin Museum, and to rapid and extensive fieldwork by the poet Andrei Voznesensky, the exhibition was put together in a spirit of jubilation - though not, it may be surmised, without opposition from some who thought that the Soviet Union would have done better to leave the centenary unmarked.</p>
        <p>Some 50 paintings, most of them from the artist's later years, were lent by Vava Chagall, and a smaller but especially cogent group was lent by Ida Chagall. Everything else in the show, including the entire graphic representation, came from Soviet sources. At a rough count, nearly 30 paintings of real importance, dated between 1906 and 1925, had been lent not only by the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and the Russian Museum in Leningrad but by museums in Pskov, Bialystok, Yerevan and elsewhere, not to mention the private collectors whose continued existence often surprises the foreign visitor.</p>
        <p>Without having seen the large and all-but-monochromatic ''Self-Portrait with Muse'' of 1917-18, lent from the Gordeyeva collection in Leningrad, we cannot truly estimate either the enduring impact of Paris upon Chagall before 1914 or the agility with which he could depart entirely from the idioms that we recognize as Chagallesque. Even the gamut of tone, which went from white through gray to palest moon-blue, has no equivalent in Chagall's work.</p>
        <p>As for the Tretyakov Gallery's ''Wedding'' of 1918, it too could be called a revisionist masterpiece. It is painted almost entirely in blacks and whites - black suit for the bridegroom, white dress and white veil for the bride, black house and black fence to keep them private and snug, black-suited Jewish fiddler somewhere way up at the back. Inside the house, we glimpse a table set for feasting, and down from the sky there swoops a guardian angel with big cherry-red wings to bless the union. This painting alone would have made Chagall's reputation.</p>
        <p>We realize, without being told, that ''Wedding'' draws upon his experience of Vitebsk. He knew all the shortcomings of his native town. ''A place apart from all others,'' he once called it. ''A singular, unhappy and tedious town. There were synagogues by the dozen - no, by the hundred. Also butchers' shops, and passers-by.'' He had grown up in Vitebsk at a time when to be a Jew there was to be a tethered man, with none of the mobility, social and geographical, that was the birthright of the European gentile before 1914.</p>
        <p>The Jew in Vitebsk lived in a society that denied him certain fundamental rights. Chagall dealt with that in his art by positing a state of affairs in which the Jew had supernatural powers. Imagination was his revenge. He could float high and free above the rooftops with his beloved in his arms. He could cross the town - or (why not?) the whole world - in one colossal stride. And he could make life dance to the tunes that he drew from his green violin. In all this, he held tight to the objective realities of life in Vitebsk, as if by doing so he could remake them for the better.</p>
        <p>In many another country, such a painter would be honored in such a town. Streets would be named after him, and schools, and hotels, and above all a museum. But it emerged during work on the Chagall centenary exhibition in Moscow that nothing of the kind was likely to happen in Vitebsk. Speeches were made in Byelorussia, and articles written and published, to protest the identification of Vitebsk with someone who was both a Jew and a Zionist. Chagall may have been back at home in Moscow, but Vitebsk wanted no part of him.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it should be said that if Chagall left Russia in 1922 and never returned, except for a brief private visit in 1973, it was not because he was expelled. It was because he realized that although he had been willing to pitch in and help to build a new society, both his fellow artists and the theater directors with whom he had hoped to work made it clear that they would just as soon see the back of him. And if his work, though carefully preserved in Soviet museums, was rarely if ever seen in their galleries, it was because it was thought to be effete, backward-looking, sometimes mystical and too often concerned with specifically Jewish subject matter. To overcome this long and loathsome tradition and get so large a show hung in Moscow in Chagall's centenary year was as much a political achievement as an esthetic one.</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, Chagall was about as apolitical as a man can be. When he was living in Paris before World War I, a young Russian critic called A. V. Lunacharsky came to his studio and persistently criticized his work from a political point of view. Chagall didn't care for that one bit, and finally he said, ''If your Karl Marx is so smart, why don't you summon him back from the dead and get him to answer your silly questions about my work?'' He was left with a bad impression of the whole visit, and assumed that the feeling was mutual.</p>
        <p>But when Lunacharsky was put in sole charge of Russian artistic life after the revolution of 1917, he asked Chagall to take over the art school at Vitebsk. Acting from a humane and liberal point of view, Chagall enrolled not only every house painter in Vitebsk as students in the school, but all the house painters' children as well. Wearing a traditional Russian shirt, and with a leather briefcase under his arm, he lobbied as best he could for money, food and materials, all of which would otherwise have been in very short supply. Any artist who wanted to teach in Vitebsk was welcome to do so, and a lot of gifted people came (though not for long).</p>
        <p>In this way, Chagall did the work of a humanitarian. Ideologically speaking, however, he rated nowhere. When he organized the celebrations in Vitebsk in October 1918 for the first anniversary of the revolution, the authorities were outraged to find that the walls and house fronts of Vitebsk has been turned into a fairy-tale barnyard, in which many-colored cows danced, played the violin and waltzed around in the sky, and the only human beings in sight were not heroes of the revolution but circus performers in costume.</p>
        <p>When Lunacharsky got wind of this, he appointed a 26-year-old painter, Vera Ermolaevna - ''the Gioconda of Vitebsk,'' Chagall called her - as rector of the school. El Lissitzky became head of printing and graphic art, and in November 1919 Kasimir Malevich arrived to teach painting. These were hard-line avant-gardists under whose guidance the general direction of the school was completely transformed. Chagall's work could not have been more out of step with that of his new colleagues, whose aim it was to sever every link with descriptive art and to pursue an altogether more radical direction. While Chagall was away, busying himself with the practical problems of the school, they banded together and gave him 24 hours' notice to resign his position and leave town.</p>
        <p>It was a rough business, but in tune with the times. As a teacher, Malevich was older, stronger, more committed and more charismatic than Chagall would ever be. (One student in the school wrote later that whereas under Chagall the problems of everyday life were a continual preoccupation, Malevich brought a completely new approach to the function of the school. ''He was a true leader.'') Between the Chagall who dreamed of levitation, and of swinging his young wife like a kite, high in the air above him, and the Malevich who painted the famous ''White on White'' (now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York) there could be no compromise.</p>
        <p>Nor did Chagall fare much better in the theatrical activities toward which Lunacharsky had specifically encouraged him. He had an innate sense of drama. Even ''The Window Looking Onto the Garden'' of 1917 - another Leningrad loan - has a Chekhovian air that makes us wonder what will happen next, somewhere between the light and airy interior and the woodland beyond. Who will come towards the house with fateful tread, we ask ourselves? But Chagall isn't telling.</p>
        <p>He was a solitary dreamer, and theater is teamwork. A painting like the ''Homage to Gogol'' in the Museum of Modern Art is the quintessence of theater, but once again we don't know quite where it's going. And when Chagall was asked to work with some of the leading directors of the day, he had trouble integrating himself into their productions. Those who swore by Stanislavsky expected a minutely simulated realism from their stage designers, and Chagall was not the man to go along with that. His was a pure, intense, inimitable vision, whether the commission was for Gogol's ''Inspector General'' or ''The Playboy of the Western World'' by J. M. Synge, and somehow it rarely seemed to fit the climate of the times.</p>
        <p>The great exception to this, and one for which we had looked to the centenary show for the long-withheld evidence, was the Jewish Theater in Moscow. Even there, where Chagall might have seemed a collaborator made in heaven, there were problems with the director. But there has for many years been talk of Chagall's designs for the three short plays by Sholem Aleichem with which the theater opened in 1921, and above all of his big decorations for the interior of the theater itself. In those big decorations, Chagall is believed to have given his whole self. That idea was certainly borne out by the sketches that remained in his possession. So it was a disappointment that, for whatever reason, his work for the Jewish Theater was not touched upon in the centenary exhibition.</p>
        <p>But the noble colonnaded spaces of the Pushkin Museum were most handsomely and variously filled. The case for the late work of Chagall was put with particular eloquence in paintings like ''Jacob's Ladder'' and ''Cows Over Vitebsk.'' These might have been no more than recycling of themes first mooted 50 or 60 years earlier, and Chagall might have looked like a man killed by adulation. But there was in their execution a firm and weighty quality that showed them to have been thought out afresh. They were luxurious, but of flabbiness there was not a trace. At the opening ceremonies the applause was loud and long both for Vava Chagall and for Andrei Voznesensky, but the true hero of the day was Chagall himself, who did not have to dream of levitating above the rooftops of the Pushkin Museum but would have been welcome to make it inside, through the big front door and up the red carpet installed for the occasion.</p>
