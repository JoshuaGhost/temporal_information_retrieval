        <p>Color photos delineating ancient tribal ruins, rocks sculpted by the winds and striations in the Southwestern desert sands are juxtaposed in this book with pictures of ancient and contemporary coiled basketry, Navajo rugs and Pueblo pottery. Earth tones and textures reverberate from the land to the crafts in HARMONY BY HAND: Art of the Southwest Indians -Basketry, Weaving, Pottery (Chronicle Books, Cloth, $30; Paper, $16.95). The authors - Patrick Houlihan, Jerold L. Collings, Sarah Nestor and Jonathan Batkin, all experts on the culture of the American Southwest - use rare black-and-white portraits as well, many from the turn of the century, showing the artisans at work. The text is less enticing. Technology and the history of these tribal crafts are discussed in phrases that tend to be as dry as the desert winds. For centuries Indian craftsmen have believed in the spiritual qualities of the materials they employ; their designs can often be traced back to distant ancestors; and there is, among a few other oases in the book, an explanation of the spirit path, a broken line in the design that allows the artists' spirits to escape from their basketry, weaving or pottery. So it is hard to understand how the intricate patterning of men and beasts on a masterly basketry bowl could be dismissed here as designs that are ''merely decorative and have no particular symbolic significance.'' Perhaps the artists feared that sharing mystical secrets with museum experts would disturb the harmonies these talented hands created.</p>
