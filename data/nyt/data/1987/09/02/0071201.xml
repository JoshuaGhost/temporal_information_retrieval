        <p>LEAD: A high school football star was stabbed to death in Queens Monday night when he confronted a group of youths who had been harassing a female friend, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A high school football star was stabbed to death in Queens Monday night when he confronted a group of youths who had been harassing a female friend, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the student, David Woods, 16 years old, was walking his dog near his home in Woodside, Queens, about 10:30 P.M. when he met a neighborhood girl who said she had been slapped by a teen-aged boy who lived nearby.</p>
        <p>When she spotted the youth standing with four friends a few blocks away, David confronted the group in front of a building at 60-10 47th Avenue. A fight erupted, and David was stabbed once in the chest, according to a police spokesman, Officer Peter O'Donnell. Suspect Is Found</p>
        <p>The victim's older brother, Jeffrey Woods, 18, saw the scuffle from a car parked a dozen yards away and rushed to help. Jeffrey held his wounded brother in his arms, but could not staunch the bleeding, friends said.</p>
        <p>David was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, Officer O'Donnell said.</p>
        <p>The authorities said late yesterday that detectives had found a suspect in the stabbing, and that he had agreed to surrender this morning accompanied by a lawyer. Law enforcement sources identified the suspect as Danny Chaves, 16, a neighborhood youth with no criminal record.</p>
        <p>A young man answering the phone at the Woods residence said the family's lawyer had advised family members not to speak about the incident. Called a Natural Leader</p>
        <p>But others who knew David described him as an exceptionally talented young man who was a natural leader.</p>
        <p>''You hear all the cliches about good kids, but David was special,'' said Thomas J. Pugh, the head football coach at Holy Cross High School in Flushing, Queens, where David would have been a junior this year. ''He was so outstanding in so many things - coaches from other schools would see him and ask us 'Is this guy for real?' ''</p>
        <p>At Holy Cross, a formidable football power that has produced several outstanding college and professional players, David was a starting linebacker on the varsity football team even when he was only a sophomore.</p>
        <p>He served as captain of his freshman football team, captain of his junior-varsity football and baseball teams, and was elected most valuable player by his junior-varsity teammates.</p>
        <p>''He was that good,'' said Mr. Pugh, who has coached football at Holy Cross for 17 years. ''We knew when he came to the school that he was considered one of the best players in the area, and as we watched him we could see why. He could individually turn a game around.'' Became Exemplary Student</p>
        <p>Told in eighth grade that he would have to improve his grades to make the high school football team, David became an exemplary student, winning a place on the school's honor roll each semester of his high-school career. He also played tuba in the school's concert orchestra and stage band, family members said.</p>
        <p>David, who was 5 foot 11 and had reddish-brown hair, weighed 175 pounds ''but played like he weighed 250,'' Mr. Pugh said. ''He was fearless.''</p>
        <p>''The way he died is so characteristic,'' the coach added. ''He was always sticking up for people, helping them out.''</p>
        <p>The son of deaf parents, David was not handicapped, but used his skills at sign language to exchange game signals from the huddle with a sidelines coach who also was skilled at signing, Mr. Pugh said. Students React to Killing</p>
        <p>Although Holy Cross High School is still on summer vacation, news of the killing sent a shock wave through the school's student body, as it was passed from one student to another.</p>
        <p>When the team was informed of David's death at practice yesterday morning, ''some of the kids were really uncontrollable,'' Mr. Pugh said. ''We all cried for more than an hour.''</p>
        <p>Team members and friends had spent much of the day at David's house consoling his family, the coach said.</p>
        <p>''This is the toughest thing,'' Mr. Pugh said. ''He was everything you could want your own son to be.''</p>
