        <p>LEAD: National Football League teams are offering free-agent players released in this week's first major rounds of cuts a $1,000 bonus to agree to rejoin the teams in case of a strike this season.</p>
        <p>National Football League teams are offering free-agent players released in this week's first major rounds of cuts a $1,000 bonus to agree to rejoin the teams in case of a strike this season.</p>
        <p>Jack Donlan, the owners' chief labor negotiator, confirmed yesterday that he and his advisers drew up the ''strike-option contracts'' and distributed information about them to the 28 teams via a memo four months ago and a reminder last week.</p>
        <p>The revelation came on the day the executive committee of the National Football League Players Association set a strike deadline. The committee would not reveal the strike date.</p>
        <p>Donlan said last night the parties agreed to resume negotiations later this week.</p>
        <p>Concerning the bonuses, Donlan said: ''What we're saying to the player is: 'You're being cut now. If you can find your way to another team, God bless you. If you want to stay around, we'll pay you $1,000 and we'll honor the contract you originally signed with us.' ''</p>
        <p>The current collective bargaining agreement expired at midnight. But the earliest the union can strike is Sept. 15, after the season's first weekend, because its mandatory 60-day notice of intent to strike was filed on July 15 with the National Labor Relations Board and the 28 N.F.L. teams.</p>
        <p>Following a meeting in Washington yesterday of the union's nine-man executive committee, Gene Upshaw, the executive director, said it would recommend the strike date to the full board of player representatives next Tuesday in Washington. He said he wanted the players to consider the date before revealing it to the public.</p>
        <p>Donlan has said he expects the players to set the walkout following the third weekend of the season, at which point they would have the minimum amount of time required to qualify for a year's pension.</p>
        <p>The teams, meanwhile, began their first mandatory cuts of the season to get down to the roster limit of 60 by this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Williams Andrews, the Atlanta Falcons' career leading rusher, announced his retirement, a year after coming back from a knee injury that kept him sidelined for two seasons. Andrews was one of a number of veterans to go.</p>
        <p>Among those cut yesterday were David Woodley, a one-time Super Bowl quarterback starter attempting a comeback with Green Bay after a year in retirement; Anthony Hancock, Kansas City's first-round wide receiver draft choice in 1982; Steve Kreider, a wide receiver and an eight-year veteran with Cincinnati, and Joe Rose, Miami tight end.</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh cut Dennis Winston, an 11-year linebacker, and Eric Williams, a five-year player who started at free safety the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>The Dallas Cowboys acquired Rolf Benirschke, the place-kicker, from the San Diego Chargers for an undisclosed draft choice. Benirschke, a 10-year veteran, is ranked as the third most accurate kicker in National Football League history.</p>
        <p>Danny Noonan joined the Cowboys yesterday after ending a 41-day holdout.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad it's over and I'm ready to go,'' said the all-America nose guard from Nebraska, the Cowboys' No. 1 draft pick.</p>
        <p>Noonan will receive a total of about $1.6 million for four one-year contracts.</p>
        <p>The Buffalo Bills acquired the wide receiver, Trumaine Johnson, from the Chargers in exchange for a rookie linebacker, David Brandon. Johnson, a former United States Football League star, caught 30 passes for 390 yards and a touchdown for the Chargers last season.</p>
