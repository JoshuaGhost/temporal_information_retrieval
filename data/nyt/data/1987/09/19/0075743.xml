        <p>LEAD: The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday severely criticized Delta Air Lines, whose planes were involved in a series of hazardous incidents this summer.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration yesterday severely criticized Delta Air Lines, whose planes were involved in a series of hazardous incidents this summer.</p>
        <p>The report by an agency safety team, one of the harshest F.A.A. criticisms of a major airline's flight operations, charged that Delta lacked clear management policies on crew training and coordination.</p>
        <p>The team, which checked crew performance on dozens of flights, said it had ''observed instances of a breakdown of communications, a lack of crew coordination and lapses of discipline in Delta's cockpits.'' Lack of Crew Coordination</p>
        <p>''There is no evidence that Delta's crews are (on the whole) either unprofessional or purposefully negligent,'' the report said. ''Rather, it was observed that crew members are frequently acting as individuals rather than as members of a smoothly functioning team.''</p>
        <p>The report called for numerous changes, including upgrading training and proficiency checks, tougher monitoring of crew coordination and mandatory use of headsets instead of relying on loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>Delta issued a statement yesterday noting that the F.A.A. inspection team had found the airline ''in general compliance with the Federal air regulations'' and had levied no fines. Delta Welcomes Report</p>
        <p>The company's chairman, R. W. Allen, said, ''We welcomed the F.A.A. team's visit, and consider their report to be a conscientious and professional effort, and will use this resource to fine-tune and further strengthen our operation.''</p>
        <p>The criticism was released in a period of widespread public unease over flight safety. The concerns have been generated by months of increasing reports of near misses, controller errors, and pilot mistakes. These fears reached a climax with the crash of a Northwest Airlines MD-80 jet in Detroit last month in which 156 people were killed.</p>
        <p>The aviation agency's new chief, T. Allan McArtor, has been holding meetings with industry executives, including the chief pilots of all airlines, stressing the need for a re-emphasis on crew professionalism to curb safety hazards and reassure airline travelers.</p>
        <p>The five most harrowing of the incidents involving Delta flights this summer occurred over the North Atlantic on July 8 when a Delta L-1011 jumbo jet strayed 60 miles off course and came within 30 to 100 feet of colliding with a Continental Airlines Boeing 747. Both aircraft were westbound from London to the United States and carried a total of almost 600 peoeple. Hazardous Airline Incidents</p>
        <p>In the other incidents, a Boeing 767 dropped to 500 feet over the the Pacific Ocean after a pilot inadvertently shut down both engines, a plane landed at the wrong airport in Kentucky, another landed on the wrong runway in Boston and the pilot of another had to abort a takeoff in Nashville when he mistakenly thought the tower had cleared him. A Southwest Airlines jet, taking off in the opposite direction from the same runway, passed safely overhead.</p>
        <p>''Some elements of the F.A.A. review essentially paralleled the earlier findings of our own detailed internal investigation,'' Mr. Allen said. ''We believe the widely publicized incidents of two months ago were totally out of Delta's character and were aberrations coincident only in time.''</p>
        <p>Anthony J. Broderick, associate administrator of the F.A.A. for aviation standards, said Delta would submit a comprehensive response to the agency early next month.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, they are making major changes to their training program and flight operations organization,'' he said. ''And we'll work with them to make sure they bring them up to a level they want them to be and we expect of them.'' Suspension of 11 Pilots</p>
        <p>All of the 11 pilots involved in the five incidents were initially suspended from flying by the airline. The license of the captain in the engine-shutdown incident was later revoked by the F.A.A. while his co-pilot has been exonerated and returned to flying status.</p>
        <p>Bill Berry, a Delta spokesman, said some of the other suspensions had expired and that some of the pilots had indicated they would retire.</p>
        <p>The leader of the 10-member F.A.A. inspection team was Marion B. Dittman, an experienced Boeing 727 pilot.</p>
        <p>The report emphasized the need for Delta to improve the guidelines, procedures, and training whereby two- and three-member cockpit crews would most effectively integrate their work.</p>
        <p>The individualistic pilot behavior found on numerous flights, the report said, ''is primarily due to a lack of clear-cut, definitive guidance from those responsible for developing and standardizing cockpit procedures. Analysis of Management</p>
        <p>''Delta's management,'' it added, ''has maintained a policy of delegating the maximum degree of responsibility and discretion to its crew members. The team speculates that this policy has been functional in the past. Delta has enjoyed an excellent reputation in the industry. However, in an increasingly complex and stressful environment, the limit of this policy appears to have been reached.''</p>
        <p>This was an apparent reference to several aspects of the phenomenal growth of air travel after deregulation of the airlines nine years ago. Among them are: the increase in congestion in the air and on the airports, the growing shortage of experienced pilots, the proliferation of different types of airliners, and the increased computerization and automation that pilots have to master.</p>
        <p>The report said that the inspectors had monitored Delta crew performances on 116 flights and that the majority of the criticisms involved crew coordination.</p>
        <p>As examples it cited nonstandard division of labor between the pilot and co-pilot in raising or extending landing gear or flaps. Focus on Cockpit Operations</p>
        <p>''Except for unusual circumstances,'' it said, ''efficient cockpit management dictates'' that the pilot not guiding the plane should operate gear and flaps and adjust various dashboard instruments. Another criticism was that the flight engineer on three-pilot crews was often relegated to performing ''nonessential functions during criticial phases of flight.''</p>
        <p>The safety team recommended that Delta ''study, develop, and publish specific crew duties for each crew member.''</p>
        <p>On almost every inspection flight, the team member noted ''distractions in the cockpit precipitated by use of speakers.'' Sometimes, it said, this led the pilots to miss radio calls dealing with air traffic.</p>
        <p>The report recommended that the airline direct its pilots to use headsets rather than relying on cockpit speakers that everyone can listen to at once but that are vulnerable to interference from engine or other noise.</p>
        <p>On the subject of periodic flight checks given to pilots, the report noted numerous instances where ''in no case was any individual item graded unsatisfactory nor was an overall grade of unsatisfactory entered on the check ride report.''</p>
        <p>The team recommended that Delta's management ''give serious consideration to the implications of tolerating minimum standards in training and on proficiency checks.''</p>
        <p>Finally, the report spotlighted the failure of some crews on international flights to plot their navigation progress on special charts. Earlier such a failure had been noted by the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation of the near-collision of a Delta jet with another airliner over the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The report said the inspectors made no effort to determine whether the practices they criticized were unique to Delta or typical in the industry.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. team recommended designating special check pilots to monitor the proficiency of crews flying international trips.</p>
