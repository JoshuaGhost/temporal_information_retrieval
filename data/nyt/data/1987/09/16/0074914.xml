        <p>LEAD: The handful of film and television stars who still need the experience of performing live theater are staying on Broadway for briefer periods than ever before, a factor that producers and industry observers agree is having a negative effect on a business that desperately needs newer, younger audiences.</p>
        <p>The handful of film and television stars who still need the experience of performing live theater are staying on Broadway for briefer periods than ever before, a factor that producers and industry observers agree is having a negative effect on a business that desperately needs newer, younger audiences.</p>
        <p>Fewer and fewer stars are willing to forgo the rewards of television and film roles in exchange for a lengthy run on Broadway. The names, for example, of five actors appear over the title of ''Into the Woods,'' the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical that opens next month at the Martin Beck Theater. Each of those names is well-known to regular New York theatergoers, but only one of them -that of Bernadette Peters - is nearly as well-known beyond Broadway, something that can be crucial to a show's longevity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Peters, who has worked extensively on Broadway, has also made several movies, starred in a television series and concertized regularly throughout the country since beginning her career in the New York theater. But while she stayed on Broadway in ''Song and Dance'' for over a year, and in ''Sunday in the Park With George'' for nine months, she is under contract to ''Into the Woods'' for just 16 weeks. Another Name: John Malkovich</p>
        <p>Ms. Peters's is not an unusual situation. Very few actors who work on both coasts are willing to commit to Broadway for more than a few months.</p>
        <p>''I could stay as long as I want in the show,'' Ms. Peters said yesterday of ''Into the Woods,'' pointing out that while her obligation to ''Sunday in the Park'' had been five months, both she and her co-star, Mandy Patinkin, stayed longer. ''Of course, you don't earn as much on Broadway as you do making a film or doing concerts,'' she conceded. ''But the most important thing to me is doing projects that are the most interesting.''</p>
        <p>John Malkovich, who appeared opposite Dustin Hoffman in a 1984 Broadway revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' before winning major roles in films such as ''Places in the Heart'' and ''The Killing Fields,'' also returns to Broadway next month, in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This'' He is under contract for six months, said James Freydberg, one of the play's producers. Like Ms. Peters, Mr. Malkovich regularly does stage work in New York and Chicago, and could stay with ''Burn This'' longer. 'Les Liaisons' a Case in Point</p>
        <p>The most dramatic example of how the lure of film and television adversely affects Broadway came last month, when the American producers of ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' closed the Royal Shakespeare Company production rather than recast it with American actors, even though the play was doing extremely well at the box office and might, given a lengthier run, have recouped its investment. According to one person close to the production who requested anonymity, several major American actors were cast in the play, including Glenn Close, who appeared in ''The Real Thing'' on Broadway for six months in 1984. But when Ms. Close would commit to no more than four months in ''Liaisons,'' the producers decided it would be too costly to recast and recostume the show twice in so short a period of time. Ms. Close was not available for comment yesterday, but her agent, Catherine Olin, confirmed that the actress had been willing to go into the show.</p>
        <p>''It would have been nonsensical to go with a short booking here,'' James Nederlander, one of the producers of ''Liaisons,'' said in an interview. Mr. Nederlander said that he was trying to put together another company of the show for his theaters on the West Coast. ''I'm going to do the show anyway, on tour, and try to bring it back to New York.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees that three or four months is too short a time for a star to spend on Broadway. ''It might very well have been worth it to have Glenn Close in 'Liaisons' for three months,'' Mr. Freydberg said. Regarding Mr. Malkovich, the producer added, ''He's signed for six months from opening night. But he said if the audiences were there and he still loved doing it, he'd stay. If he doesn't still love doing it, he'll leave. And why not?'' 'Now We're Losing the Actors'</p>
        <p>One producer argued that Broadway, not Hollywood or Burbank, is at fault. ''Of course, it's understandable that the stars won't stay long,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, who produced ''Broadway Bound.'' ''The truth is, we are dealing on Broadway in ways from the 1930's and 40's, except now we do it with computers. So we sell tickets better. We've lost the directors and the authors, and now we're losing the actors.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe we should have an institutional theater with a sense of containment, with a different structure, a subscription of plays with limited runs,'' Mr. Azenberg said. ''Then you could lower prices, the stars would only have to be there three or four months.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Azenberg acknowledged that his show might have been helped if Linda Lavin, an actor with a strong television following, had stayed longer than nine months. Ms. Lavin, who won a Tony award for her role in ''Broadway Bound,'' left the show at the end of August. ''Of course, it would have helped if Linda had stayed longer, in that sense,'' he said. ''But what are we talking about - making five dollars instead of six dollars? What have we done to deserve more time from stars?''</p>
        <p>In the recent past, several stars have been able to appear on Broadway specifically because they were not locked into long runs: Robert De Niro in ''Cuba and His Teddy Bear'' in the summer of 1986, for example, and Al Pacino in ''Richard III'' in 1979. ''Hurlyburly,'' in 1984, became a kind of revolving door for a number of stars. And Elizabeth Taylor brought thousands into the theater with her own short-lived production company.</p>
        <p>Frank Langella, the star and one of the producers of ''Sherlock's Last Case,'' contracted for nine months in that show. Like his colleague Joel Grey, who returns to Broadway next month in a revised version of ''Cabaret,'' Mr. Langella made it clear he would stay if the audiences were there.</p>
        <p>''I'm in it through February, and I can stay longer if I choose,'' Mr. Grey said yesterday. ''Indeed, a film has come up in that time period, and I'm going to have to make some decisions. I don't think Broadway is a luxury. I wouldn't want to work anywhere else.''</p>
