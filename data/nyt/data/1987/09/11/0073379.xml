        <p>LEAD: The former chairman of Allegheny International Inc. defended himself today against charges of failing to report perquisites, saying he was allowed to use corporate planes for personal trips because of threats against his life.</p>
        <p>The former chairman of Allegheny International Inc. defended himself today against charges of failing to report perquisites, saying he was allowed to use corporate planes for personal trips because of threats against his life.</p>
        <p>Robert Buckley, who resigned from the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate last summer, broke a yearlong silence to respond to a complaint filed against him Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The complaint says in part that Mr. Buckley and Allegheny failed to make proper disclosure of company perquisite, and that Mr. Buckley was the ''personal beneficiary'' of corporate assets that were never properly reported.</p>
        <p>Among the things not disclosed were personal trips on the company's five planes taken by Mr. Buckley and other officers, the S.E.C. said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley told a news conference that Allegheny's board gave top officers permission to use the planes on personal trips as a safety measure after they received threats from Irish terrorists. He said he did not know the name of the group threatening him, but he and two other Allegheny officers were targets because a British company that was owned by Allegheny makes police material used in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>He said the decision on what to disclose was made by corporate legal counsel and officers, and he could not be held accountable.</p>
