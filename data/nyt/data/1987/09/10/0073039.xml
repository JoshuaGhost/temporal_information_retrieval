        <p>WITH the proliferation in tile types and designs, manufacturers and dealers stress the importance of choosing the proper tile. Each type has qualities like resistance to frost, stains, slips and abrasions that make it more or less suitable for certain uses.</p>
        <p>Most tiles are sold by the square foot, and prices usually range from about 90 cents to $15. Custom-made, antique and otherwise exceptional tiles are usually sold by the piece.</p>
        <p>Installation costs, which are not included in the tile price, depend on such things as the complexity of the room. Placing tiles that must be cut to fit around cabinetry in a bathroom, for example, will be more expensive.</p>
        <p>Improvements in thin-set adhesives have made it possible to bind tiles directly to existing surfaces without a mortar bed. The subsurface must be sufficiently rigid for a successful thin-set installation - a plywood subfloor, for example, should be at least an inch thick.</p>
        <p>Tiles that require a full mortar bed are the handcrafted ones like the Mexican terra cottas. Their uneven backs call for a thicker cushion to give the tile continuous support.</p>
        <p>Prices for a thin-set installation range from $7 to $12 a square foot in New York City, including the cost of thin-set and grout. With a mortar bed, prices range from $10 to $20. Grouts now come in many colors and sometimes they can be custom-colored to match.</p>
        <p>In New York there are dozens of tile stores and showrooms, both wholesale and retail. While some showrooms are open to the public, others require that designers accompany clients, or that the purchase be made through a designer.</p>
        <p>The spirit of the new designer tiles and their many possibilities are perhaps most visible in the bathroom and kitchen vignettes built into the elaborate new Hastings Tile showroom at 230 Park Avenue South, between 18th and 19th Streets (212-674-9700). The Nemo Tile Company showroom is around the corner at 48 East 21st Street (212-505-0009); it carries a range of traditional and contemporary tiles.</p>
        <p>Country Floors, which has a new downtown showroom at 15 East 16th Street (212-627-8300), specializes in more traditional tiles, including ceramic architectural moldings and some antique tiles. Ceramique Francois at 107 Greene Street, between Prince and Spring Streets, (212-431-6240), specializes in contemporary tiles, including the series by Ettore Sottsass, and clear-glass tiles. All four of the above showrooms are open to the public, and purchases can be made directly.</p>
        <p>The showrooms of the American Olean Tile Company (212-688-1177), Elon Inc. (212-759-6996) and the Amsterdam Corporation (212-644-1350) in the Architects and Design Building, 150 East 58th Street, are open to the public. Tile may be ordered directly at Elon and at Amsterdam, while American Olean will provide a list of commercial outlets. United Ceramic Tile Corporation at 156 Fifth Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets (212-691-3600), is open only to designers.</p>
        <p>Solar Antique Tiles, 97 Clinton Street, at Delancey Street, is open to designers and the public by appointment only (212-254-3044), for viewing samples of antique Portuguese tiles. Prices range from $8 to $100 a tile, and from $200 for a small four-tile mural to $50,000 for large antique murals.</p>
