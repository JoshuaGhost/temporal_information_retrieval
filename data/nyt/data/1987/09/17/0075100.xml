        <p>A former United States Congressman arrived in Bangkok today with six relatives of American servicemen unaccounted for in Laos or Vietnam since the 1960's. The group plans to release 2,500 balloons Thursday with messages offering large rewards to those who can produce a missing American.</p>
        <p>The delegation, headed by former Representative William Hendon, a North Carolina Republican, has raised $2.4 million to offer to citizens of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to bring out any American serviceman still alive and in captivity.</p>
        <p>''Nothing else has worked,'' Mr. Hendon said, alluding to more than a decade of negotiations with the governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</p>
        <p>In Indochina, the United States has diplomatic relations only with Laos, where 549 Americans are still listed as missing. Another 1,776 are unaccounted for in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>The group plans to go to northeast Thailand Thursday to inflate the balloons and send them into Laos.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 (AP) - The State Department said today that a private group's plan to float balloons in Indochina to advertise $2.4 million in rewards for the rescue of American servicemen could hurt official efforts to account for the missing. The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest group representing the relatives of the missing, also criticized the effort.</p>
