        <p>The National Semiconductor Corporation, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported earnings today for its 13-week first quarter ended Aug. 30 of $13 million, or 10 cents a share.</p>
        <p>The company lost $1.4 million in the 16-week first quarter of the previous year. Sales rose 3.3 percent, to $517.6 million, from $501.1 million.</p>
        <p>Net income for the first quarter of 1988 includes an extraordinary credit of $1.5 million, or a cent a share, reflecting tax-loss carry-forwards. Beginning with the 1988 fiscal year, the company said it would adopt a 52-week fiscal year, ending on the last Sunday of May and consisting of four 13-week quarters.</p>
        <p>''Even with a shorter quarter, our sales were up slightly and both the Semiconductor Group and Information Systems Group experienced improved operating performance compared to the first quarter a year ago,'' said Charles E. Sporck, National Semiconductor's president and chief executive.</p>
