        <p>Fairchild Industries, a diversified military contractor, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its aircraft operations to an investor group headed by senior management. The company also said it had agreed to sell a subsidiary that makes building products to Pacific Precision Metals Inc., a company formed by Fairchild employees.</p>
        <p>The company said the price for the two transactions totaled about $75 million.</p>
        <p>The Fairchild aircraft operations include two units in San Antonio and one in Crestview, Fla. The operations, which modify aircraft and make turboprop planes, reported 1986 revenues of $132.1 million and operating income of $13.1 million. The building products subsidiaries reported combined revenues of $24 million and operating profits of $4.2 million last year.</p>
        <p>The company said that the two deals are part of a restructuring plan announced last month. At that time, the company said it was narrowing its focus to aerospace and defense electronics.</p>
