        <p>LEAD: What makes a symposium high-powered? ''The importance of the issues, the status of the speakers and the level of expected attendance,'' answered Sy J. Schulman, discussing an upcoming symposium that will probe such weighty issues as regional transportation problems, the outlook for interest rates, United States competitiveness around the world and the growing labor shortage in the county.</p>
        <p>What makes a symposium high-powered? ''The importance of the issues, the status of the speakers and the level of expected attendance,'' answered Sy J. Schulman, discussing an upcoming symposium that will probe such weighty issues as regional transportation problems, the outlook for interest rates, United States competitiveness around the world and the growing labor shortage in the county. Five well-known economists and fiscal experts on the national, international and New York regional economies will be on hand to discuss specific topics. ''The keynote speaker, is Dr. William J. Ronan, perhaps best known as the man who 'invented' the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.'' Mr. Schulman said. ''And the other speakers are equally distinguished.''</p>
        <p>The Second Annual Fall Economic Symposium is co-sponsored by the Westchester County Association and the Westchester County Bankers Association. A half-day seminar will be held from 8:30 A.M. to noon Wednesday at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in White Plains. Mr. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, and Victor Compe, president of the bankers association and executive vice president of the Scarsdale National Bank, will moderate.</p>
        <p>Drawing on his experience in the fields of transportation and economic development, Dr. Ronan will lead off by presenting his views on the critical transportation issues facing Westchester and the region. He is to be followed by Eric J. Kruger, director of economic research for the Conference Board, a nonprofit business service organization based in Manhattan. Mr. Kruger will discuss the importance of United States competitiveness in international markets. Robert E. Manning, the chief economist of Axe-Houghton Management of Tarrytown, will then speak about interest rates.</p>
        <p>Labor problems will come under the scrutiny of the next two speakers. Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will report on a new study of how local companies are reacting to the growing shortage of labor in the New York City region. And Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, will discuss key regional labor-market trends.</p>
        <p>''Bankers and others making economic decisions need the insights to be provided by these well- known experts,'' Mr. Compe said. Mr. Schulman agreed: ''The discussion of labor issues will deal with one of the most serious problems now facing employers. And we know that regional decisions such as new trans-Hudson crossings and improved regional airports are directly related to Westchester's viability and growth.'' Reservations for the symposium, including a continental breakfast, are $35 a person. For registration information, call 664-8486 or 948-6444.</p>
