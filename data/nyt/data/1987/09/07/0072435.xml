        <p>LEAD: Raymond J. McInerney, a political organizer for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, rolled up his sleeves, switched on a videotape player and faced the 30 women who make up the shop stewards' council for Local 2250.</p>
        <p>Raymond J. McInerney, a political organizer for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, rolled up his sleeves, switched on a videotape player and faced the 30 women who make up the shop stewards' council for Local 2250.</p>
        <p>''You remember back in '84, a lot of people criticized a lot of unions because they endorsed Walter Mondale without finding out enough about what people think,'' Mr. McInerney said. ''This year, they don't want that to happen. Your opinions are going to have an impact on the strategy this union takes in 1988.''</p>
        <p>In Local 2250's union hall in suburban Maryland and in thousands of others across the country labor leaders have been conducting an exercise in political organization in the video age as they search for a consensus on one of the 1988 Presidential candidates.</p>
        <p>The tape Mr. McInerney played for the women of Local 2250 is one of 15,000 copies of a program produced by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Thirteen Democratic and Republican contenders had four minutes each to address the organization's 13.1 million members. 'I Don't Know' Is Leader</p>
        <p>Labor officials say tens of thousands of union members have seen the tape since it was distributed in early May.</p>
        <p>Officials of some of the largest unions said Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachussetts, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri usually come out the best in the video sessions, with Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Simon generally increasing their support in straw polls.</p>
        <p>But so far, labor officials said, the effort has only underscored the uncertainty that led the labor federation to decide last month not to endorse any candidate yet.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that 'I Don't Know' is clearly still in the lead,'' said Jerry P. Clark, political director for Mr. McInerney's union, which has 1.1 million members.</p>
        <p>Still, union officials say the tape has given activists a look at the candidates and has helped efforts to map a strategy in the absence of an A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement.</p>
        <p>Union organizers are concentrating on getting as many activists as possible to stand as delegates for candidates who appear to have a chance in local primaries, and the video helps that process. For the candidates, it means free access to thousands of union members. Videotapes Replace Candidates</p>
        <p>''Even if the union itself cannot endorse, you can get a lot of value from a union leader who campaigns for you,'' said Ira M. Lechner, labor liaison representative for Senator Simon.</p>
        <p>The idea of sending a videotaped message to campaign events in place of a candidate was exploited occasionally in 1984. But the practice has become widespread in the 1988 campaign, along with packages like the ones created by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the National Education Association and a few other organizations.</p>
        <p>''They are the questionnaire of the '80s,'' said Daniel B. Payne, the media consultant to the Dukakis campaign. ''They used to send these long forms asking you about everything that is bothering this organization or that group. Now, they make the request to do it on videotape.''</p>
        <p>The A.F.L.-C.I.O. video presents the candidates in alphabetical order, Democrats first, all on the same simple set.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, the audience at Local 2250 paid more attention to the Democrats than the Republicans. Studied Poses and Words</p>
        <p>Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, is the first to speak. Leaning his right elbow on the podium, hand in pocket, he confronts a potentially troublesome issue: as Governor of Arizona in 1983, Mr. Babbitt called out the National Guard during a violent copper strike because, he says, he held the body of a slain 3-year-old girl and realized that ''public safety comes first.''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, perches on a stool, immaculately groomed, handkerchief in breast pocket, and talks of the ''fundamental opportunities'' available to the next President.</p>
        <p>Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, another Democrat, stands with his hands folded on the podium. The youngest candidate in the field at 39, he talks about ''a fresh start'' for America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon proclaims: ''I'm the only candidate for President not afraid to run representing the Democratic tradition of Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis emphasizes his record as Governor. When he speaks, the camera stays close to his face, a technique Mr. Payne said was intended to exploit Mr. Dukakis's ease with a camera.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson says Americans should ''not cut back but fight back'' and emphasizes his ties with organized labor. Dukakis and Simon Gain</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt stresses his trade policy, intended to boost American industry by taking action against nations with an unequal trade balance.</p>
        <p>In the before-and-after polling at Local 2250, Vice President Bush, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Jack F. Kemp of Buffalo were the only Republicans to tally votes. Mr. Bush dropped from 5 votes to 1, while Mr. Dole fell from 4 votes to 1. Mr. Kemp, who did not get any votes before the tape, had one afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis jumped from 4 to 15 votes and Mr. Simon, the only other candidate to improve his standing, went from 1 vote to 3.</p>
        <p>Divided on the candidates, the shop stewards unanimously praised the video.</p>
        <p>''I always felt kind of left out when they backed a candidate,'' said Sharon Caltrider. ''The only time we ever heard from the leaders was when they wanted us to work the polls.''</p>
        <p>Maxine Grusholt said she ''didn't think anyone bothered to ask us what we think.''</p>
        <p>Will union leaders pay attention this year? ''Probably not,'' she said, ''but maybe, who knows?''</p>
