        <p>LEAD: BY now, Gerry Frank has heard the question hundreds of times. Yet he still graciously explains how it came to be that an Oregonian who works in Washington wrote a best-selling guidebook to New York City.</p>
        <p>BY now, Gerry Frank has heard the question hundreds of times. Yet he still graciously explains how it came to be that an Oregonian who works in Washington wrote a best-selling guidebook to New York City.</p>
        <p>It started, he said, as a way to get some exercise. It became a hobby, which turned into a small enterprise titled, ''Where to Find It, Buy It, Eat It in New York.'' Tonight, Bloomingdale's is recognizing this one-man walking and publishing band with a dinner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank began working in Washington in 1966 as an unpaid aide to his friend Mark O. Hatfield, newly elected to the Senate. The position appealed to Mr. Frank because his family had sold its Oregon department stores in 1965, and he had no desire to continue as an employee.</p>
        <p>''I decided the state had been good to my family, so I would give my time to public service,'' he said. He divided his time between Oregon and Washington, but he found the capital city generally unremarkable.</p>
        <p>Not wanting to spend weekends there, Mr. Frank flew to New York regularly. ''To get some exercise,'' he said, ''I'd always take a different area and just start walking.''</p>
        <p>New York never bored him. On a recent stroll, Mr. Frank explained his fascination with the city by stopping abruptly and pointing across an intersection. ''See that fountain?'' he said. ''One day, I walked by here and there was a guy taking a bath in it. He was soaping up, right at 55th and Sixth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank soon became a valuable resource for friends who wanted to know where to eat and shop in New York; they urged him to write a guidebook. Eventually, he did. Manuscript in hand, he visited New York publishers. ''They said, 'What's somebody from Oregon doing writing a book on New York?' '' he recalled. ''They wouldn't give me the time of day.'' So in 1980 he paid an Oregon publisher to print 10,000 copies.</p>
        <p>The problem then was what to do with all those copies. ''This is the honest-to-gosh truth,'' said Mr. Frank, a man with an iron handshake and a gentle smile. ''I came back here, went out of the Plaza hotel, walked down Fifth Avenue, walked into Dalton and said: 'I've got a problem. I've got 10,000 copies of this book.' ''</p>
        <p>After Dalton agreed to take a few, Mr. Frank repeated the process with other retailers. Once he learned more about the book business, he talked to distributors as well. And that's how he sold - and continues to sell - his guide. He does it in his spare time, researching, writing, marketing and promoting it himself. (After the first printing sold out, Mr. Frank dropped the Oregon publisher and hired a printer.) The book has sold about 250,000 copies.</p>
        <p>Why would a busy man, a wealthy man, a man who could do whatever he liked, take on such a project? ''It was something I felt I could do myself,'' he said. ''Gerry Frank's name didn't mean anything in New York.'' For the first time, he explained, he wouldn't be received as the well-known scion of a prominent Oregon family. In New York, he was nobody.</p>
        <p>That was why he started. But why continue? ''I'm a perfectionist, a very driven sort of person,'' he said. He has to be. The book must be updated continually, because a new edition is issued every two years. Seven years after the guide first appeared, Mr. Frank still spends six days a month in New York, walking and taking notes. He tries to revisit every establishment he mentions, eliminating some and discovering others.</p>
        <p>The guidebook is aimed at the person who wants bargains as well as quality. It is highly idiosyncratic, listing Mr. Frank's favorite places, along with stores he considers tasteless and restaurants to be skipped.</p>
        <p>His years in the retail business make it easy for him to know whether clothing in a discount store is identical with the more expensive versions sold uptown. For women's clothing at discount, he favors Ben Farber (462 Seventh Avenue, between 35th and 36th Streets). Best for men's clothing, he said, are Gorsart (9 Murray Street, between Broadway and Church Street) and Saint Laurie Ltd. (897 Broadway, between 19th and 20th Streets).</p>
        <p>Some new entries evolve from friends' tips, others from readers' requests, such as the long-running demand for a dry cleaner open on Sunday. For the 1988-89 edition, Mr. Frank lists Marty's Tailor/Dry Cleaner (845 Seventh Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets).</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank still works for Senator Hatfield, as chief of staff, overseeing 50 employees. The two began their association nearly 30 years ago during Mr. Hatfield's campaign to be Oregon's Secretary of State.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Frank helped with his friend's gubernatorial race, they both won something: Mr. Hatfield became Governor; Mr. Frank became the the sole judge of chocolate cakes at the Oregon State Fair. Every year for the last 27 years, he gets to take two bites from each of 130 or so cakes.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, he took his passion for chocolate cake a step further and opened a European-style sweet shop in Salem, Ore.: Jerry Frank's Konditeroi. ''In Oregon,'' Mr. Frank said with quiet pride, ''I am known as Mr. Chocolate.''</p>
