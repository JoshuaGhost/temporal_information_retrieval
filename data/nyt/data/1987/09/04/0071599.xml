        <p>LEAD: The tennis courts at the Hyundai executive apartment compound were empty today, and so was the adjoining company-owned hotel, a comfortable place with faint delusions of grandeur.</p>
        <p>The tennis courts at the Hyundai executive apartment compound were empty today, and so was the adjoining company-owned hotel, a comfortable place with faint delusions of grandeur.</p>
        <p>The authorities had evacuated everyone after rumors circulated that striking Hyundai workers planned to attack symbols of corporate splendor in this South Korean industrial bastion.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of riot policemen ringed the apartment complex, with apple-shaped tear-gas grenades in hand. At the hotel, an employee stripped to his undershirt when he ventured outside, because he thought that his uniform made him a conspicuous target.</p>
        <p>But except for a brief skirmish between the police and workers near the hotel entrance, nothing happened. ''They panicked,'' a striker said. ''No one was really interested in the hotel.''</p>
        <p>The fear of trouble was almost as important as reality today as 20,000 workers went through a second day of a walkout that has shut the giant shipyard here of Hyundai Heavy Industries. Strikers, wearing their gray company uniforms, filled the streets outside the yard, whose main gate happened to lie across the road from the beleaguered Hyundai hotel.</p>
        <p>While South Korea continued to be jolted by hundreds of labor strikes, national attention and concern was focused on Ulsan. The Hyundai shipyard is a major division of the country's largest conglomerate, and thus a symbol of South Korea's export-driven economic success.</p>
        <p>There also were good reasons to worry about violence. The previous night had been spattered with unpleasant incidents as workers smashed windows and burned cars at the Ulsan city hall, six miles from the shipyard.</p>
        <p>Early today, a worker was killed and three others were injured when a drunk driver ran into them. The authorities showed some nervousness, but it soon abated. The casualties had no political overtones.</p>
        <p>Car-burnings and window-breakings resumed for a while today, but the Hyundai strikers insisted that it was the work of provocateurs, either Government agents of radical students. To prove they were serious, workers took four men from their midst, marched them to the police, one by one, and denounced them as troublemakers. Still, tensions lingered.  While the Government warned that strikes will undermine the economy, workers argue that they are long overdue for a greater share of the wealth. In Ulsan, where the Government had intervened two weeks ago to stop another Hyundai strike, labor and management are said to be bogged down over a few percentage points' difference in proposed salary increases.</p>
        <p>But for some workers more than money is at stake. ''What we want,'' one of them said, ''is more dignity.''</p>
        <p>He was standing outside the shipyard gate, a man about 40 years old, surrounded by colleagues. What he said suggested that harmony between management and workers may not have been irrevocably torn by the strike.</p>
        <p>''I love my company,'' he said. ''My basic loyalty lies with the company. But we want equal treatment. We don't want the master-servant relationship that has been traditional in Korean companies.''</p>
        <p>He and others held forth on serious grievances and minor slights, a litany of the intolerable and the uncomfortable - safety hazards, poor ventilation, company intrusion into personal lives and an overweaning paternalism.</p>
        <p>And, of course, low pay. It was not easy getting by on a base pay of $360 a month, a factory worker complained.</p>
        <p>This may be the best time to tend to long-neglected wounds, he said. ''Basically, the political climate is right,'' he said, ''and strikes at other companies have given us the courage to act.''</p>
        <p>But there is concern among many workers that they should not go too far, too fast. They reject any alliance with campus radicals, for example, and question whether even the Government should get involved.</p>
        <p>More than a few also feel that contract negotiations should have continued without a strike. ''This is a family problem,'' said Park Myung Ho, a shipyard engineer. ''We'll take care of it within the family.'' By CLYDE HABERMAN ULSAN, South Korea, Sept. 3 - The tennis courts at the Hyundai executive apartment compound were empty today, and so was the adjoining company-owned hotel, a comfortable place with faint delusions of grandeur.</p>
