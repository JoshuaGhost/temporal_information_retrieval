        <p>LEAD: What happened to Steffi Graf in the final of the United States Open was not new, or even completely unexpected. It had happened to the best tennis players before her - to Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Tracy Austin and even Martina Navratilova, who thrashed Graf in straight sets Saturday to win her fourth</p>
        <p>What happened to Steffi Graf in the final of the United States Open was not new, or even completely unexpected. It had happened to the best tennis players before her - to Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Tracy Austin and even Martina Navratilova, who thrashed Graf in straight sets Saturday to win her fourth Open championship in five years.</p>
        <p>The skills and strategies that made those players No. 1 in the world simply were not enough.</p>
        <p>But now Graf must do what many before her have done: She must adjust. Finding a Soft Spot</p>
        <p>Relying primarily on her devastatingly powerful forehand and the strongest groundstrokes in women's tennis, the 18-year-old West German has crushed her opponents. Going into the Open, she had lost only once in 62 matches - to Navratilova in the final at Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>While that seemed to leave little room for hope among her fellow players, Evert predicted before the Open that it was only a matter of time before she and the other top players found a soft spot in Graf's game.</p>
        <p>''It's just getting used to a player,'' she said. ''She's still new. We just don't know very much about her.''</p>
        <p>Now the book on Graf is wide open for every player to see. It reads: Attack her backhand and charge the net. 'Attackable Weaknesses'</p>
        <p>''For two years Steffi's been dictating the points because we've all been stupid,'' Pam Shriver said. ''You can't stay back and let her just steamroll from the baseline.''</p>
        <p>Shriver, who was seeded fifth, lost to Graf in the quarterfinals, largely because she committed 23 unforced errors. ''I really felt I could carry out the game plan and win,'' she said. ''I never felt I could do that before.''</p>
        <p>''You can read her backhand,'' said Lori McNeil, who lost to Graf in the semifinals in three sets, becoming the first player in the tournament to win a set from Graf. ''When you come in, you make her have to win the points in a way she's not used to.''</p>
        <p>''She got a great weapon,'' Navratilova said, ''but she's also got an attackable weakness.''</p>
        <p>As the tournament progressed it became increasingly evident that no timid player was going to stop Graf. The statistics kept during the matches showed that her lower-ranked victims in the first three rounds - Bettina Falco of Argentina, Petra Huber of Austria and Patricia Tarabini of Argentina - came to the net only three, five and eight times in their respective straight-set defeats. Shriver Sets Tone</p>
        <p>Tactics changed somewhat in the fourth round when Sylvia Hanika, a West German, mixed up her shots, alternating off-speed topspin with slices, and charged the net on 15 occasions. That forced Graf into 28 unforced errors, her highest total to that point in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Shriver set the tone for Graf's final three matches, reaching the net 56 times in their two-set match. Then McNeil forced the action by coming in on 93 occasions, 46 times in the third set alone. She shook Graf, who made 25 errors, including nine missed backhands. But like Shriver, she was too erratic, committing 30 unforced errors.</p>
        <p>Navratilova was on the net with quickness and frequency, 61 times over all. But more important, her 13 errors were the fewest of any of Graf's opponents in the tournament, while the teen-ager's 31 mistakes were the most Graf committed.</p>
        <p>Now, said Navratilova, the onus is on Graf, as it was on the champions before her, to improve her weaknesses without sacrificing her strengths.</p>
        <p>''That's always the tough thing to do,'' Navratilova said. ''A lot of times if you spend your time working on your weaknesses, your strengths suffer. It will be interesting to see how she can improve her backhand and still hold onto her forehand. And obviously she's not that comfortable at the net; she may never be.''</p>
        <p>Then Navratilova paused, pondered Graf's predicament, and smiled. ''I'd like to be in her shoes,'' she said. ''She's 18 years old. She's got plenty of time to improve.''  U.S. OPEN</p>
