        <p>LEAD: New York State's administration of rent guidelines is ''chaotic'' and in such disarray that tenants and landlords are denied a fair hearing of rent disputes, a State Assembly panel concluded today.</p>
        <p>New York State's administration of rent guidelines is ''chaotic'' and in such disarray that tenants and landlords are denied a fair hearing of rent disputes, a State Assembly panel concluded today.</p>
        <p>The panel also found that the state's Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, William B. Eimicke, had ''knowingly provided false information to the Legislature and the public'' to make it appear the agency had less of a backlog of rent-stabilization cases than it actually had.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the findings, in a 49-page report by the Assembly Committees on Housing and on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation, were a reprise of comments made at two days of public hearings last March.</p>
        <p>The report fell short of calling for Mr. Eimicke's removal. But in interviews several members of the panel -among them Assemblymen Jerrold Nadler and John Brian Murtaugh, both Manhattan Democrats - called for his dismissal and that of other top state housing officials. Housing Agency's Defense</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Eimicke, Tom Viola, defended the housing agency, saying: ''We think we've done an outstanding job. We think they should be throwing flowers at us instead of bricks.''</p>
        <p>He said that in the three years since the state took over the administration of rent laws from New York City, it had successfully established a register of all rents. He said it had also ordered the return to tenants of $36 million in rent overcharges, compared with $4 million returned in the previous 11 years, before the state took over.</p>
        <p>The Assembly report depicted an agency in disarray at all levels. It said officials resolved rent cases hastily and incorrectly just to be able to say that they were resolved, with the errors sometimes being unfair to tenants and sometimes to landlords. It found that some officials making rent decisions lacked full knowledge of the rent codes.</p>
        <p>And it cited an array of other problems, from an inadequate computer system to failure to answer telephones set up as tenant information lines.</p>
        <p>''I just couldn't believe that any branch of government was this bad,'' Assemblyman Murtaugh said. ''I think they need a reorganization at the very top. The Governor has got to restructure this.''</p>
        <p>The report recommended that the state housing agency conduct an audit and analysis of its management and communications systems, that it develop written procedures for processing cases and teach them to the agency's employees, and that it decentralize its operations, providing more services to landlords and tenants at local district offices.</p>
