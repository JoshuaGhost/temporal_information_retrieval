        <p>LEAD: It has been said that artists make the most eloquent spokesmen for detente, a notion suggested by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky's appearance Saturday night at Tanglewood. The Soviet conductor, who led the Boston Symphony Orchestra in performances of works by Sibelius, Mussorgsky and Scriabin, brought to the music an easy command and a dramatic sensibility that prompted long standing ovations on a night when oppressive heat might have discouraged enthusiastic response.</p>
        <p>It has been said that artists make the most eloquent spokesmen for detente, a notion suggested by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky's appearance Saturday night at Tanglewood. The Soviet conductor, who led the Boston Symphony Orchestra in performances of works by Sibelius, Mussorgsky and Scriabin, brought to the music an easy command and a dramatic sensibility that prompted long standing ovations on a night when oppressive heat might have discouraged enthusiastic response.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Moscow native is among the most respected of Russian conductors and has recorded extensively both with his own ensemble, the State Symphony Orchestra of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, and with various orchestras in Europe and the United States. His appearances in this country are rare. He conducted at Tanglewood in 1979; the subsequent breakdown of Soviet-United States cultural relations caused his absence until last summer when he was scheduled to lead the Bostonians. A flu postponed the appearances until this season; Saturday night's performance was the first of three for Mr. Rozhdestvensky at Tanglewood; he is to conduct again Friday and Saturday evenings before moving on to the Ravinia Festival, where he leads the Chicago Symphony in two concerts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rozhdestvensky, who stood on the stage floor rather than the podium when conducting, displayed an unpretentious confidence and a kind of avuncular charm. Though his gestures with the baton were broad, he never resorted to flamboyant mannerism in order to make apparent his intentions.</p>
        <p>Those revolved largely around the development of dramatic structures. The conductor elicited from the players sonic intensity and a breadth of expression that came not from easy theatrics but from attention to the shape and direction of phrases, so that the music always sounded purposeful.</p>
        <p>Especially in the Sibelius Second Symphony, which opened the program, Mr. Rozhdestvensky allowed the score to develop at its own pace and at times in a leisurely fashion. Climaxes were not rushed or contrived but seemed to emerge naturally from the notes. The andante unfolded with a dignified grace that made the briskness and boldness of the last two movements all the more distinctive. Mr. Rozhdestvensky reveled especially in the rich melodies of the symphony's final pages.</p>
        <p>Mussorgsky's song cycle ''Sunless'' opened the program's second half. The work is set to poems by Count Arseni Golenishchev-Kutuzov, the composer's roommate in 1874, when Mussorgsky was also at work on the opera ''Khovanshchina'' and on ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' For this performance, the orchestration of the original piano accompaniment to ''Sunless'' was by Edison Denisov, a Soviet composer, who managed to preserve the music's bleak character while subtly bringing forth its unusual harmonies.</p>
        <p>Dimiter Petkov, a Bulgarian-born bass, served as soloist. He delivered the six, unrelentingly pessimistic songs with little distinction. Mr. Petkov's voice had difficulty carrying over the orchestra.</p>
        <p>The ''Poem of Ecstasy'' by Scriabin rounded out the evening and allowed Mr. Rozhdestvensky to recapitulate qualities that distinguished his rendering of the Sibelius. He laid out slowly the gentle themes that opened the work and let tempos ebb and flow without sudden shifts but with a keen sense of direction. At the end, he drew from his players an engulfing and brilliant sound that brought the concert to a bracing close.</p>
