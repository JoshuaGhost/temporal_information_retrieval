        <p>LEAD: The Yankees did not talk about a sweep when they arrived, but late today - after they had taken three straight from the Toronto Blue Jays and moved in front by three games in the American League East - they allowed themselves a small luxury.</p>
        <p>The Yankees did not talk about a sweep when they arrived, but late today - after they had taken three straight from the Toronto Blue Jays and moved in front by three games in the American League East - they allowed themselves a small luxury.</p>
        <p>They called it revenge, a return for losing three in a row last month in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to get them back,'' Don Mattingly said after the Yankees had struggled to a 12-inning 6-1 victory over the Blue Jays at sold-out Exhibition Stadium. '' 'Revenge' is a word you could use to describe it. They took it to us in New York pretty good, but we came here and won three straight. It's like Winnie said: We've got the whole family back now.'' Feeling of Togetherness</p>
        <p>It was Dave Winfield, the right fielder, who suggested the other day that the Yankees are a family again with Mattingly and Rickey Henderson recovered from injuries. And now, with a resounding surge in a critical series, there is a togetherness among the players, something they have not known in some time.</p>
        <p>Today, they completed the sweep by sending 10 batters to the plate in the 12th inning and scoring five runs off three Toronto pitchers. Wayne Tolleson's single to right - his third hit of the game - drove in the go-ahead run, but the Yankees did not let up.</p>
        <p>Mike Pagliarulo drew a bases-loaded walk from Jose Nunez, Mattingly knocked in one with a single, and a throwing error by Kelly Gruber permitted two more, providing Pat Clements with his second victory without a defeat this season.</p>
        <p>Just three weeks ago, the Yanks, who are now 20 games over .500 (49-29) for the first time since 1985, seemed devastated after Toronto had stormed into the Stadium and taken away the division lead. But both Mattingly and Henderson were down and out of the lineup then, and since that time the team has gone 14-5 while the Blue Jays have lost 11 of 20.</p>
        <p>''We were very close to being embarrassed by them,'' said Tolleson. ''But we've got too much pride to be embarrassed. We've got a lot of pride and a lot of know-how. We bounced back from it.''</p>
        <p>It was their defense, which has made the fewest errors in the league this season, that held off the Blue Jays in extra innings. Clements worked out of one jam in the 10th, when Toronto had runners at first and third with no outs but did not score. And in the 11th, Mattingly earned a Gold Glove with two spectacular plays.</p>
        <p>They came after Charlie Moore's leadoff double to the gap in right-center. Garth Iorg hit a bouncer toward Mattingly, who gloved the ball cleanly, then threw perfectly to third, getting Moore as he slid into the bag. The next hitter, Tony Fernandez, hit a sharp grounder to Mattingly's right. He dived, made the stop, then rose to his feet and threw out the runner at second.</p>
        <p>''I'm semishallow on the turf,'' Mattingly said of Iorg's grounder. ''The ball was hit hard, so it's basically an easy play. As long as the ball is hit at me or to my right, I'm going to make that play.'' Washington Starts It</p>
        <p>The Yankees, shut down for three and two-thirds inning by Tom Henke, finally broke through against Toronto's third pitcher, Jeff Musselman, who gave up a single to Claudell Washington to open the 12th. Mark Salas put down a sacrifice bunt, but Moore, the Blue Jay catcher, made an ill-advised throw to second and was late.</p>
        <p>Paul Zuvella's bunt moved the runners to second and third, and Tolleson broke the tie. PIK UP ONLY ADD YANKS</p>
        <p>Long before the end came, this one had developed into a game of pitching. Tommy John, who lasted just one and one-third innings five days ago against the Baltimore Orioles, looked like a starkly different pitcher. Jimmy Key, his counterpart, was equally impressive.</p>
        <p>John pitched seven innings, got 17 of 21 outs on ground balls and left with a 1-0 lead. Key shut down the Yankees on five hits through the first seven innings, but he wavered in the eighth and was removed.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored after Tolleson led off with a single through to center field. Henderson slapped a high bouncer in front of the plate for a hit, putting runners at first and second. They were moved up on a sacrifice by Pagliarulo, and then Key intentionally walked Mattingly to load the bases. Clutch Hit by Winfield</p>
        <p>It was a questionable move at best. Jimy Williams, the Toronto manager, opted for his left-hander to face Winfield, a right-handed hitter who was batting .352 in his previous 23 games, rather than Mattingly. But Winfield stroked a single to left, driving in Tolleson.</p>
        <p>Yet John did not benefit. Rich Bordi started the eighth, gave up a double to George Bell, and Clements allowed him to score. He threw a wild pitch, then gave up a sacrifice fly to Gruber, making it 1-1.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees, who won the first two games here by 15-14 and 4-0, finished this one after a slight delay. And they might have also put the Blue Jays on the run. ----Randolph and Kittle Sit Out Willie Randolph sat out the game so he could rest his sore left knee, and Ron Kittle also did not play because of a stiff neck. The Yankees had a starting infield that consisted of Zuvella at second base, Tolleson at third and Bobby Meacham at shortstop, but Meacham was gone by the third after spraining his right ankle as he was being picked off the bag at first. He'll be out about 10 days. . . . The crowd of 47,828 on Canada Day, celebrating the country's 120th birthday, set a single-game record at Exhibition Stadium. The three-game series here drew 135,304.</p>
