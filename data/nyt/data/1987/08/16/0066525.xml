        <p>LEAD: A 77,109-acre expanse of remote mountains, deserts and caves was dedicated today as the first new national park in the 48 contiguous states in 15 years.</p>

        <p>LEAD: A 77,109-acre expanse of remote mountains, deserts and caves was dedicated today as the first new national park in the 48 contiguous states in 15 years.</p>
        <p>A 77,109-acre expanse of remote mountains, deserts and caves was dedicated today as the first new national park in the 48 contiguous states in 15 years.</p>
        <p>The Great Basin National Park, the nation's 49th, includes 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak and other stunning mountains towering above sagebrush desert, alpine lakes, limestone caves, lush meadows and groves of gnarled bristlecone pine, the oldest living trees.</p>
        <p>But loneliness is perhaps its most striking feature; the park is 75 miles from the nearest Interstate highway, 300 miles north of Las Vegas, 250 miles southwest of Salt Lake City and 375 miles east of Reno.</p>
        <p>The nearest town, five miles from park headquarters, is Baker, a hamlet with half a dozen houses, a bar, cafe, gasoline station, post office, two-room school, trailer park, seven-room motel and 50 residents. New Image for Nevada</p>
        <p>At the dedication today, Gov. Richard H. Bryan suggested that the beauty of the park would present a different side of a state better known for casinos, legal brothels, nuclear weapons tests and radioactive waste dumps.</p>
        <p>In prepared remarks, Governor Bryan said the dedication ''marks a turning point in the image our state projects to the rest of the nation.''</p>
        <p>''At last I believe we are fulfilling our initial promise to visitors - that Nevada is gaming and so much more,'' Governor Bryan said. Former Senator Paul Laxalt said the creation of the park ''did not necessitate a land grab and lockup by the Federal Government nor did it require large amounts of the taxpayers' dollars.''</p>
        <p>A visitor, Frank Barnett, a retired Government geologist from Malta Bend, Mo., said the area is ''absolutely outstanding with the vast valleys and the sharp mountains.''</p>
        <p>''The vistas are unbelievable,'' he said. A 63-Year Campaign</p>
        <p>Governor Bryan noted that the campaign to establish a national park in Nevada started nearly 63 years ago with a bill introduced in Congress by the state's Democratic Senator, Key Pittman. Former Senator Alan Bible continued that effort in the 1960's, describing the area as ''marvelously scenic'' and ''somewhat unbelievable in its arid setting.''</p>
        <p>But creation of the park was blocked repeatedly by mining and agricultural interests in Nevada. Under a compromise plan signed last October by President Reagan, mining can continue on existing claims in the park and cattle and sheep can graze forever on the flanks of Wheeler Peak.</p>
        <p>The park is considered representative of the sharp scenic contrasts found in the Great Basin, a vast region of mountain ranges extending southward from Oregon like ''an army of caterpillars crawling toward Mexico,'' in the words of C. E. Dutton, a geographer. Administration Was Opposed</p>
        <p>The park headquarters and visitor center is at Lehman Caves, nearly a mile of spectacular underground limestone caves discovered by a local farmer in 1885. The caves became a national monument in 1922.</p>
        <p>While small compared to Yellowstone, the nation's first and largest national park, the new park is about the same size as Arches National Park and twice the size of the Bryce Canyon National Park, both in neighboring Utah.</p>
        <p>Great Basin is a name coined by the explorer John C. Fremont, who traveled through this area in the early 1800's.</p>
        <p>At the outset of the Reagan Administration, Interior Secretary James G. Watt stopped acquisition of land for parks on the grounds that the nation had to take better care of existing parkland.</p>
        <p>There was no cost for establishing the Great Basin park, which was carved out of a national forest.</p>
        <p>The Administration opposed the original House bill in 1986, arguing that acquisition of the private land needed for the 174,000-acre park envisioned in the bill would pose problems, especially since mining claims had been established on some of the land involved.</p>
        <p>Compromise legislation eventually created a 77,109-acre park, with no private land involved.  GREAT BASIN PARK  Geography</p>
        <p>The Great Basin National Park covers 78,600 remote acres of mountains and deserts in eastern Nevada near the Utah border.  The Big Attractions</p>
        <p>Wheeler Peak in Nevada, 13,063 feet above sea level, is the park's showcase. Near the summit is a small glacier, the southernmost ice field in the United States. Lehman Caves, near the park entrance, is the largest limestone cavern in the West.  Campsites</p>
        <p>There are 72 campsites in the park and three developed campgrounds reachable by car along the Wheeler Peak Scenic Road.</p>
