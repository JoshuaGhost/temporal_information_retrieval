        <p>LEAD: DURING the summer I keep my cooking to a minimum.</p>
        <p>DURING the summer I keep my cooking to a minimum.</p>
        <p>Like most people, I live on a diet of grilled fish or meat, along with summer vegetables - corn, zucchini, tomatoes and herbs and other vegetables from the garden. But I don't usually serve the grilled foods plain. That would be dull. Either I marinate them in herbs and spices before they are grilled, or I serve them with a sauce.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite summer sauces is a Hollandaise made with tomatoes and fresh herbs. It goes with just about anything you put on the grill -except hot dogs. For fish, I like a vinaigrette flavored with red pep-pers, basil or tarragon. Sorrel, which is probably the easiest vegetable of all to grow and cook, makes a wonderful sauce for fish, chicken, lamb or veal. It can be served hot or cold.</p>
        <p>Making a Hollandaise sauce has often been considered a difficult task, but, in fact, it is perfectly simple, provided you are careful not to let the mixture get too hot, so that it curdles. If this should happen, add a teaspoon of iced water near the spot where it has begun to separate and whisk vigorously, widening the circumference until you have absorbed the rest of the sauce. If this doesn't work, add another egg yolk.</p>
        <p>Many recipes for Hollandaise call for melted butter, but I have always found it much easier to add small pieces of cold butter to the sauce as it is cooking. This prevents it from suddenly curdling - and it will come out just as smooth.</p>
        <p>To keep Hollandaise sauce warm, place it over a double boiler. Do not, as one helpful friend of mine did, put it in the oven. You will have scrambled eggs.</p>
        <p>Tomato Herb Hollandaise  (Steaks, Chops, Chicken or Fish)  Preparation time: 5 minutes  Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes  2 ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped  2 shallots, minced</p>
        <p>1/4 cup white wine vinegar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup white wine  3 egg yolks  6 ounces cold , unsalted butter, cut into chunks</p>
        <p>Course salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste  2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves  1 tablespoon fresh tarragon leaves  1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Put the tomatoes, shallots, vinegar and wine into a small pan and cook 15 minutes. Strain and return to the pan. Reduce to two tablespoons.</p>
        <p>2. Off heat, whisk in the egg yolks. Place over low heat and continue whisking. Add the butter, a couple of pieces at a time. Be very careful not to overcook the sauce or it will separate.</p>
        <p>3. Continue adding the butter and whisking, moving the pan on and off the heat to prevent it from getting too hot. Whisk until the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Mince the basil, tarragon and thyme and add them immediately so that they do not have time to turn brown. Serve at once.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup.  Basil Vinaigrette  (For Fish)  Preparation time: 10 minutes  Cooking time: 10 minutes  2 cloves garlic, peeled</p>
        <p>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>Juice 1 small lime  2 medium shallots, minced</p>
        <p>About 1 cup loosely packed basil leaves  5 ripe medium-size tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped</p>
        <p>Course salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Simmer the garlic cloves in boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove and drain. Chop finely.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the oil, garlic, lime juice and shallots. Chop the basil and add with the tomatoes. Mix thoroughly and season with salt and pepper to taste. 3.</p>
        <p>* Serve the sauce in a small bowl or sauce boat, to be spooned over the fish at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup.  Sorrel Sauce  (Chicken, Fish, Lamb or Veal)  Preparation time: 5 minutes  Cooking time: 10 minutes  2 large shallots, minced  1 small clove garlic, unpeeled and left whole  2 tablespoons butter 3/4 pound sorrel  1 cup chicken stock</p>
        <p>Course salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>Lemon juice to taste.</p>
        <p>1. In a heavy saucepan, soften the shallots and the garlic in the butter. Add the sorrel and cook, stirring, for one to two minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Add the chicken stock and cook another five minutes. Remove from stove. Peel the garlic and add the flesh to the sorrel. Puree with the sorrel mixture in a food processor and season with salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste.</p>
        <p>3. Place the sauce in a small saucepan and keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup.  Red Pepper With Tarragon Vinaigrette  Preparation time: 10 minutes  Cooking time: 15 minutes  2 shallots  1 clove garlic  1 red pepper</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fresh tarragon leaves</p>
        <p>3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>Approximately 1/4 cup red wine vinegar (to taste)</p>
        <p>Course salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Mince the shallots and the garlic and place in a bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat broiler. Cut the pepper into quarters or sixths and place skin side up on foil paper on a broiling pan. Broil until the skin blisters. Place the pepper in a paper bag and let cool. Peel away the skin and chop the pepper. Add to the bowl containing the shallots and garlic.</p>
        <p>3 Add the tarragon leaves and olive oil. Mix thoroughly. Add the vinegar, salt, and pepper and taste to correct seasoning. Place in a serving bowl and serve spooned over the fish at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup.</p>
        <p>Note: This sauce is also good on boiled potatoes.</p>
