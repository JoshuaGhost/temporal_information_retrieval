        <p>LEAD: Danny Wall, the new chief regulator of the $900 billion savings and loan industry, is enjoying his honeymoon while he can.</p>
        <p>Danny Wall, the new chief regulator of the $900 billion savings and loan industry, is enjoying his honeymoon while he can.</p>
        <p>His staff appreciates the open approach he has adopted since becoming chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on July 1, especially his efforts to bring in more hands to lessen the burden on them. Congress appreciates his assurances that the $10.8 billion it voted to rescue the industry will be enough.</p>
        <p>But when the money Congress appropriated starts being used to shut down insolvent institutions, Mr. Wall expects the mood to change quickly. 'Funerals and Shotgun Weddings'</p>
        <p>''We're going to be conducting a lot of funerals and shotgun weddings, and that is going to make a lot of people unhappy,'' he said. ''Because of the job we have to do, we are going to be stepping on a lot of toes.''</p>
        <p>Many industry analysts worry more about the depth of his agency's pockets than about the reaction of the industry, which lobbied hard for his appointment. By most estimates, the problems are so severe that it will take at least $25 billion - and maybe $50 billion or more - to close the insolvent savings and loans, prop up the weak ones and pay depositors.</p>
        <p>Industry leaders had warned that the bank board would exacerbate the problems if it moved too quickly to shut insolvent institutions. They argued for a lower appropriation than the Administration had sought as a way of preventing the regulators from charging ahead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wall supported their position, saying that the amount favored by the industry would be adequate. If he turns out to have been wrong, he could have a difficult time persuading Congress to appropriate more. A Consultant Dissents</p>
        <p>''As far as I can see, there just isn't enough money there,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant and one of the few thrift industry experts willing to criticize the new bank board chairman on the record. ''When you're new, it's the best time to acknowledge realities, but Danny's involvement as an advocate of the recapitalization plan from the beginning makes it hard for him to turn around on this issue now.''</p>
        <p>Despite the problems, Mr. Wall, who is 47 years old, aggressively sought the chairmanship of the bank board, and he has won praise so far for his efforts to build the confidence of depositors and head off a widespread run on savings and loan institutions. He has emphasized that 80 percent of the industry's 3,200 institutions are healthy, an emphasis sharply divergent from that of his predecessor, Edwin J. Gray, who repeatedly warned that the industry was in a precarious condition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wall has also received support for his efforts to restructure the bank board and its sister agency, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Throughout the two organizations, employee morale had eroded as the financial condition of the industry weakened. Many staff members had criticized Mr. Gray for his centralized and deliberate approach to managing an industry in crisis.</p>
        <p>But in his former job as chief of staff of the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Wall himself earned a reputation as something of a deliberate manager slow to take action. Aide to Senator Garn</p>
        <p>As the right-hand man to Senator Jake Garn of Utah, who was chairman of the committee when Republicans controlled the Senate before the 1986 elections, Mr. Wall was highly respected for his candor, accessibility and grasp of the issues facing the banking and thrift industries. During his tenure, however, Congress produced only one substantial piece of banking legislation.</p>
        <p>The Garn-Wall team shied away from forcing the quarreling sectors of the financial services industry to compromise. Instead, they would ask the factions to settle their differences before they dealt with the committee.</p>
        <p>''I think he is doing all the right things so far in his new job, but he was anything but a man of action while he was on the Hill,'' said one industry expert, who asked not to be identified for fear of hurting his relations with the new bank board chief. Clash With a Governor</p>
        <p>With some of the largest thrift institutions in the country ready to collapse, Mr. Wall will find it difficult to adopt a passive approach in his new job. So far at least, he has proved ready for action.</p>
        <p>Last week he took on Gov. Bill Clements of Texas when the Governor declared that the Government was not prepared to pay off depositors completely if Texas thrift institutions were closed. Hoping to avert a run on the institutions, Mr. Wall reacted immediately.</p>
        <p>''The Governor is wrong,'' Mr. Wall declared. He called Governor Clements's contention that Washington would make good on only 30 cents for every dollar of deposits ''a complete fiction.''</p>
        <p>A few Texas savings and loans reported a flurry of withdrawals, but the situation calmed quickly. Governor Clements has so far not retracted his warnings, but Mr. Wall's reassurances averted a panic that could have crippled the Texas industry just as the bank board is moving to bolster it.</p>
        <p>''I just don't see how the situation could have been handled better,'' said James Butera, chief lobbyist for the National Council of Savings Institutions. ''Few things are scarier than the prospect of a run, and Danny handled a delicate situation in an impressive way.'' A Long Workweek</p>
        <p>Friends say Mr. Wall is putting in 12-hour days, seven days a week in an effort to catch up with the mounting problems. His primary task is liquidating, selling or nursing the more than 400 institutions that are already insolvent but are still open, losing more than $10 million a day. The F.S.L.I.C., the industry fund that insures deposits for up to $100,000, is $6.3 billion in the hole.</p>
        <p>The industry has lost some $25 billion in net deposits in the last 12 months and losses piled up by the unprofitable 20 percent of the industry are almost outstripping the profits earned by the others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wall has few professional ties to the industry he is now regulating. He developed his expertise as Senator Garn's banking expert for almost 12 years.</p>
        <p>He counts his experience on Capitol Hill as one of his major qualifications for the chairmanship. ''In terms of understanding the whole universe of financial services, I may be the best qualified chairman this agency has ever had,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After being sworn in as chairman on July 1, Mr. Wall put his Congressional experience to work quickly, acting behind the scenes to push for passage of the F.S.L.I.C. recapitalization bill, even though the President had threatened to veto it. He held get-acquainted sessions with all the bank board's staff members, and established new management procedures.</p>
        <p>To his staff he has promised to be more accessible than his often embattled predecessor. Gone is the uniformed guard Mr. Gray had installed in front of his fifth-floor office. The thick glass door to the office, once kept closed, now remains open most of the day. Relations With the President</p>
        <p>Mr. Wall has also shown that he has the ear of President Reagan. He was the only top regulator invited to attend the ceremony on Aug. 10 when the President signed the $10.8 biliion rescue package into law. Several days later, he escorted 14 of his staff members to the Oval Office for a picture session with the President.</p>
        <p>''I think I see a marked improvement in staff morale already,'' said Thomas P. Vartanian, a Washington lawyer and former general counsel of the bank board. Mr. Vartanian said that Mr. Wall's effort to hire 400 employees was particularly appreciated by his staff. The agency has been chronically understaffed, he said, even though the level of work has risen dramatically as more and more institutions have failed.</p>
        <p>Despite the promising start, Mr. Wall's ability to run the bank board is only beginning to be tested.</p>
        <p>He will have to manage the closing of scores of insolvent institutions in novel ways. He will have to negotiate with some of the largest securities firms in the country, which, under the new banking law, will be able to buy insolvent thrift institutions. Each year, he will have to approve the use of almost $6 billion in F.S.L.I.C. funds.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly he will encounter more run-ins with politicians and owners of major thrift institutions, much like his confrontation with Governor Clements.</p>
