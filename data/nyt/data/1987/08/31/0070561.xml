        <p>LEAD: An authentic Joe Biden, the experts say, is worth about $10. Same for Dick Gephardt and Michael Dukakis. Even a Gary Hart fetches only about $25 and the late Hubert H. Humphrey - well, you'd be lucky to get subway fare.</p>
        <p>An authentic Joe Biden, the experts say, is worth about $10. Same for Dick Gephardt and Michael Dukakis. Even a Gary Hart fetches only about $25 and the late Hubert H. Humphrey - well, you'd be lucky to get subway fare.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there is money to be made from the signed correspondence and autographed pictures of politicians, provided one has some knowledge about a market that is not only quirky but also full of items that are not what they seem. Not many novices would suspect that, say, Pat Nixon material has considerably more value than John Poindexter material. 'Hot Time for Collectors'</p>
        <p>In this business Presidents are king. Sitting Presidents, past Presidents, even disgraced Presidents are always in demand, specialists say, and there is also considerable quadriennial interest in future ones.</p>
        <p>''Right now is a really hot time for collectors,'' says Paul Hartunian, a New Jersey dealer. ''They're betting on who the next President is going to be. Whoever has a shot - they're grabbing.''</p>
        <p>Today's $10 autographed picture of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democrat from Delaware, will jump twentyfold in value if he should win, Mr. Hartunian estimates.</p>
        <p>Authenticity has in many cases has become difficult to prove, and genuine signatures of many politicians have thus become scarce. One reason is politicians' heavier work loads and frantic campaign schedules; another, not unrelated, is the perfection of the Autopen, a machine that reproduces signatures so well that professional eyes are sometimes fooled.</p>
        <p>It was John F. Kennedy who first used Autopens with abandon; he also authorized various secretaries to sign his name.</p>
        <p>One former White House aide to President Kennedy recalls: ''We had a gal who did almost nothing but sign his name. You couldn't tell whether it was his signature or hers.'' As a result, the price of a genuine Kennedy item now approaches $2,000, about four times as much as comparable Truman or F.D.R. items.</p>
        <p>In general, Autopen signatures can be distinguished from the real thing only by finding another mechanical signature with which it matches exactly when held up to the light and even then some dealers say they cannot be sure.</p>
        <p>Only recently did Edward N. Bomsey, a collector and part-time dealer in northern Virginia, discover that a letter he got years ago from President Ford was signed by a hitherto unknown variation of the Ford Autopen. Even Presidential secretaries' signatures, specialists say, have turned up in mechanical reproduction.</p>
        <p>There are two basic kinds of autograph material. One consists of letters or personal documents, preferably handwritten, with a personal slant on topical issues. Signed photographs can also qualify in this category, as can clearly genuine autographs - perhaps in strange-colored ink or embellished with coffee stain - on such things as campaign literature.</p>
        <p>The second category, usually far less valuable, consists mainly of things created, often perfunctorally, at the request of strangers or as historic artifacts. A fairly common example of the latter are the dozens of Richard Nixon resignation statements in public hands, the result of Mr. Nixon's agreeing after the fact to sign statements typed up by collectors - usually on White House stationery - and mailed to him.</p>
        <p>There is a big gap between the value of Presidential autographs and those of the rest of the political world. Congressmen, who also use Autopens, have little value and neither do Supreme Court justices.</p>
        <p>Dealers say that there is a huge quantity of good material in private hands, however, and that this tends to come on the market only after those who first receive it die. White House aides, Cabinet officers and political reporters are prime sources of such material, but former Congressman Seymour Halpern of Queens amassed a legendary collection by going to such lengths as getting the Government Printing Office to print an extra copy of bills the President was about to sign and slipping it into the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Dealers say that while one cannot make a living hanging around politicians waiting for autographs, residents of Iowa or New Hampshire might have more opportunity than others for an autograph by the next White House resident.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ronald Reagan's stock is still very much in doubt. For one thing, as a former actor, he's been giving autographs for several decades. ''He's been so generous in signing,'' said Mr. Bomsey, ''that it's going to be interesting to see of what value they'll be after he leaves office.''  WASHINGTON TALK: POLITICAL MEMORABILIA</p>
