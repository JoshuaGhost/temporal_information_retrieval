        <p>LEAD: The new head of the Federal Aviation Administration urged the country's senior airline pilots today to renew their commitment to ''vigilance in the cockpit'' against disastrous mistakes.</p>
        <p>The new head of the Federal Aviation Administration urged the country's senior airline pilots today to renew their commitment to ''vigilance in the cockpit'' against disastrous mistakes.</p>
        <p>T. Allan McArtor, the new F.A.A. Administrator, addressed more than 200 pilots at a meeting he hastily called as public misgivings over safety and discipline in the air rose after a jetliner's crash at Detroit Aug. 16 that left 156 people dead. ''The tragic accident has reawakened all of us,'' Mr. McArtor said.  While he agreed with pilots who noted that the American commercial aviation record was the best in the world, he added: ''Is the system as safe as we can make it? No, I don't think it is.'' Equally important as the record itself, he said, is the public's perception of ''an erosion of safety.'' 'The Routine Is the Enemy'</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor's appeal came in the wake of the Detroit crash of a Northwest Airlines plane, a near miss involving a Delta Air Lines jet over the Atlantic and the close brush between a private plane and President Reagan's helicopter, among other recent incidents in the air.</p>
        <p>The Administrator, in office a month, said that in the past attention had focused largely on a pilot's ability to handle emergencies, but that he was now more worried ''about the fourth landing of the day, at sunset with clear skies, a routine, no-sweat landing.'' ''The routine is the enemy.'' Mr. McArtor said. Many of the chief pilots, who are corporate executives with responsibilities including pilot training, standards and peformance, agreed with Mr. McArtor's call for new ways to improve flight-crew safety practices. But privately, many also accused his agency of being stronger on rhetoric than on action. Human Factor in the Cockpit</p>
        <p>''The agency has spent only a small percentage of the money required to move ahead in research and training on human performance problems,'' said Capt. Henry Duffy, head of the Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots' union.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, there was wide agreement between the pilots' group and the aviation agency on a $9.4 million, three-year program of seeking ways to resolve human-factor problems that occur in the cockpit. But Captain Duffy said the program had never been developed.</p>
        <p>Another commercial pilot, who asked not to be named, said: ''No one wants to criticize McArtor because he's new and he appears to be sincere. But the bureaucracy does not have a great history of following through where it counts.''</p>
        <p>Bill Hoover, president of the Air Transport Association, the airline industry group, said: ''The wheels of bureacracy grind so slowly. The F.A.A. works in a very ponderous system.''</p>
        <p>In the Detroit case, Federal investigators have determined that the aircraft's flaps, components of the wing that lift the plane off the runway at low airspeed, were improperly positioned for takeoff and that the pilot and crew did not verify the flap settings as required in a preflight check.</p>
        <p>An automated signal that should have warned of the error apparently failed to sound as well. Investigators have not yet determined to what extent these factors may have been responsible for the disaster. Recapturing U.S. Confidence</p>
        <p>''Our nation is watching and they are concerned,'' Mr. McArtor said. ''We must recapture their confidence in the country's aviation system.'' He said he was also worried that too many commercial pilots and air traffic controllers might lack adequate experience.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, Mr. McArtor said, air traffic has grown bv 50 percent but levels of experience have generally decreased. ''That's a disturbing trend,'' he said, ''traffic up, experience down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor questioned the traditional practice of judging a pilot by the number of hours he has flown. ''For 50 years, flight hours has been a measure of proficiency,'' he said. ''Is that still valid? I'm not sure it is.''</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. chief stressed that he was ''not picking on the pilots,'' but some of those attending the conference, billed by the agency as a ''town meeting,'' felt that the meeting inevitably focused undue attention on them.</p>
        <p>''He should follow up by also meeting with maintenance people, controllers, weather people and others,'' Captain Duffy said. Mr. McArtor said he intended to do so, but that no such meetings had yet been scheduled.</p>
        <p>Captain Duffy also called upon Mr. McArtor to ''pledge to march into the halls of the Department of Transportation and Congress to get the funding,'' needed for new research problems.</p>
        <p>''Good intentions are not enough when it comes to safety,'' Captain Duffy said, adding that as long ago as the early 1980's, the F.A.A. had devised a plan to use human-factor research to deal with advanced cockpit technology, the transfer of information to flight crews and studies of pilot performance. But that plan, he said, has had to ''go begging for money'' despite the fact that ''the Administration has been sitting on a $5.6 billion surplus in the Aviation Trust Fund.'' Re-Adapting Technology</p>
        <p>The pilot said most pilots would welcome higher standards for qualification and more modern training techniques. ''We know that human error is involved in many aviation accidents,'' he said. ''That's not the question. We need to know why they occur, and how to prevent them.''</p>
        <p>He said that cockpit technology also needed to be re-adapted so that it better suited the way humans work, rather than trying to force humans to adapt to the demands of computers. ''We have re-engineered the airplane,'' he said, ''but you can't redesign a human being.''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. McArtor said they rejected the popular term ''cockpit complacency'' as an appropriate description of what may sometimes happen to pilots and crews who rely excessively on their computers to fly the aircraft.</p>
        <p>Captain Duffy said pilots had to be trained on flight simulators that more closely approximated real situations, including distractions, annoyances and multiple problems. Such computerized training programs do exist, he said, but are expensive.</p>
        <p>The success of today's meeting, several pilots said, will be judged less by what was said than by whether meaningful initiatives follow.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure all the microphones and cameras made for a very open and candid discussion,'' said Capt. Lloyd W. Barry, a senior vice president of United Airlines. ''We're going to need other kinds of meetings to really get the work done.''</p>
        <p>The airline industry, he said, was eager to cooperate with any measures that would promote safety or the perception of safety. ''We have a vested interest in reacting and reacting rapidly,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor promised that there would be additional ''roll up the sleeves'' meetings, but said that he considered it important that today's gathering not exclude the public from a discussion in which millions of Americans have a strong and legitmate interest.</p>
        <p>He told the pilots that if aviation professionals do not put their own house in order, ''nonprofessionals'' in Congress are likely to attempt to do the job for them through legislation and increased regualtion.</p>
