        <p>LEAD: Tom Baldwin couldn't really explain it -neither could a few curses. No one even hit him. But it has become almost axiomatic that, if you're a Jet, you don't have to be hit to be hurt.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Tom Baldwin couldn't really explain it -neither could a few curses. No one even hit him. But it has become almost axiomatic that, if you're a Jet, you don't have to be hit to be hurt.</p>
        <p>Tom Baldwin couldn't really explain it -neither could a few curses. No one even hit him. But it has become almost axiomatic that, if you're a Jet, you don't have to be hit to be hurt.</p>
        <p>So today, Baldwin, who became the starting nose tackle late last year because of Joe Klecko's knee injury, learned he had broken a bone in his left foot.</p>
        <p>The injury occurred on what was scheduled to be Baldwin's last play of the scrimmage Saturday against the Washington Redskins. He planted his foot to turn and broke a bone behind the small toe in his left foot. May Miss Six Weeks</p>
        <p>It will sideline him a minimum of four weeks and maybe as long as six weeks, which could be through the second game of the regular season. Klecko is not expected to return until midseason, some time in November.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Derland Moore, who will turn 36 years old in October, has become the Jets' starting nose tackle. He hasn't started since 1984, when his 14-season career with the Saints was winding down, and even he admitted he had been beaten up by all those games.</p>
        <p>Behind Moore is one of the best rookies in the Jets' camp: Gerald Nichols of Florida State, the club's seventh-round draft pick. But Nichols is still a rookie.</p>
        <p>''This throws it up for grabs,'' Coach Joe Walton said.  When the Jets face the Philadelphia Eagles in the teams' first exhibition game next Saturday, New York will be missing defensive starters because of injuries at left end, nose tackle and inside right linebacker. Considered Retiring</p>
        <p>Moore admitted he had considered retiring after last season. Then, he said, he thought about the fact that, finally, he had performed in a playoff game. He also realized Klecko would not be here at the start of the season.</p>
        <p>''I had so much fun last year,'' said Moore. ''I was just going to be back. When you go for 14 years, you're so hungry for a winner.''</p>
        <p>There has been some concern by Jets' management that Moore might not be able to take a daily pounding after all those beatings with the Saints. But Moore insisted that the year he spent on injured reserve had worked in his favor. It allowed him to recuperate, he said.</p>
        <p>He was out until last December after knee surgery. When he finally was ready to return, he asked the Saints to release him ''so I had a chance to play for a contender.'' The Saints did, but he was without a job for 16 days until the Jets picked him up for the final game of the regular season after Klecko had been hurt. Moore saw action in both of the Jets' playoff games.</p>
        <p>At his best, Moore had been able to get to the quarterback. He was switched to nose tackle in 1982 and produced four sacks, following that with six in 1983. The sack has been all but lost by the Jets' defensive line following injuries to Klecko, Mark Gastineau and Marty Lyons.</p>
        <p>Baldwin was the Jets' ninth-round draft pick of 1984, a former bouncer in college who made it to the pros with dedication. He had never been hurt before, and certainly never walked around on crutches, as he was doing now. Accentuating the Positive</p>
        <p>''I've got to turn this into a positive,'' he said. ''I've got time to lift. I'm entering the season with fresh legs and I'll be even stronger than I am now.''</p>
        <p>He thought about the injury, and what impact it might have on the team, and said:</p>
        <p>''I was in there for 12 plays and it happened on the 12th play. That's all they were going to play me for.'' Are the others down now? ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Last year we said, after Lance got hurt, 'Now what?' Then Joe got hurt. 'Now what?' You can't let these kind of setbacks mess with your mind.''</p>
        <p>Anyway, contended Baldwin, the Jets' nose tackle spot is in good hands.</p>
        <p>''Derland's got great quickness and Nichols, he's a hungry little scrapper,'' he said. ''But they're just going to be filling in for a while. I'm going to be back.'' 2 for Gordon The Jets, undistinguished in losing to the Redskins, showed a pass rush from Alex Gordon, the No. 2 draft choice from the University of Cincinnati. He had two sacks even though it was not a maneuver he used often in college. . . . Walton said the offensive line ''opened some pretty big holes.'' He noted that Mike Haight, last year's No. 1 pick, played well after allowing his man an early sack and penetration. Haight will remain at guard for now, learning the position, but may also learn tackle. . . . Coach Joe Gibbs of the Redskins said he wanted to get a bigger offensive line because they play the Giants twice a year. The Redskins ''are big,'' according to Walton. ''It's a good football team,'' he said. . . . The Redskins' team physician said he was not so sure as Gibbs that Dexter Manley would be ready for the season opener. Manley, who finished behind Lawrence Taylor with 18 1/2 sacks last season, strained an ankle and knee in the scrimmage. He is listed as ''day-to-day.'' There will be a fuller prognosis after the swelling goes down. . . . Although Russell Carter was beaten for a 70-yard pass play, Walton said he played well after that at right corner.</p>
