        <p>LEAD: It did not seem like much of a place for a party yesterday, this weedy lot at 412 Vermont Avenue in the heart of the East New York section of Brooklyn. Apart from the tall grass, there was literally nothing there, save the upside-down chassis of a long-defunct Ford Falcon, a kind of monument to urban decay.</p>
        <p>It did not seem like much of a place for a party yesterday, this weedy lot at 412 Vermont Avenue in the heart of the East New York section of Brooklyn. Apart from the tall grass, there was literally nothing there, save the upside-down chassis of a long-defunct Ford Falcon, a kind of monument to urban decay.</p>
        <p>But two years ago this month, there was an abandoned, city-owned town house on the site, and it became the focal point of a bitter struggle between the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a group of squatters determined to show that there was no reason why poor people should not own their own homes.</p>
        <p>Clive Dougal, a 33-year-old immigrant from Belize, had moved into the three-story house with his parents, two brothers and six sisters, and was trying to make it livable. But the city wanted Mr. Dougal and the neighbors who came to support him off its property, and soon the police began ''arresting people right and left,'' as one resident recalled.</p>
        <p>Unable to wrest the building back from Mr. Dougal and his neighbors, the authorities finally tore the building down. It was a traumatic event for Mr. Dougal and the neighborhood, where the median income for a family of four is $7,809, well below the poverty level and one of the lowest in the city. But that, residents now say, was a long time ago.  Hope for the Future The city and the squatters have since achieved a kind of detente, and yesterday, a few feet from the rusting black Falcon, more than a hundred residents gathered in the bright sunshine at 412 Vermont to remember the past and celebrate the future - a future in which they hope every low-income person will have a chance to be a homeowner.</p>
        <p>The rally, organized by a group called Acorn, had all the flavor of a small-town Fourth of July, complete with banners and speeches, a man carrying a big American flag and a leisurely parade to some newly rehabilitated houses about 10 blocks away.</p>
        <p>Community organizers in Acorn - the name stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now - say they called the rally for two reasons: ''to show the politicians that we can in fact rehabilitate these buildings if they just give us a chance,'' as one put it, and to announce plans to create another 1,000 single-family dwellings out of abandoned city buildings, most of which have been seized for nonpayment of taxes, So far, Acorn-backed neighborhood associations in East New York, known collectively as the Mutual Housing Association of New York, have occupied 30 buildings and are close to completing the renovation of a third of them. Their immediate goal is to acquire another 28, ultimately creating homes for 180 families. Sept. 17 Vote</p>
        <p>The whole initiative, which organizers say could never have worked without the backing of Mayor Koch and the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, hinges on Board of Estimate approval in a vote scheduled for Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>Ernestine Ross, a 59-year-old grandmother who works part time as a custodian's assistant for the Board of Education, said she became a squatter in November 1985, moving into an abandoned city-owned house at 461 Essex Avenue.</p>
        <p>Miss Ross, who lives with her son, her daughter and three grandchildren, said she thought her experience in acquiring a home was typical.</p>
        <p>''They were using that building for a drug place before I moved in,'' she said. ''It didn't have radiators; it didn't have water; the sewer was broken out in the street.</p>
        <p>''We had to put in new walls, new ceilings and everything. Me and my son Cyrus - he's 26 now - he put in all the baseboard heating and the pipes and stuff.''</p>
        <p>''We take a little money that we get every week from our paychecks and we put in a little sheet rock, a little window here and there and we fix up a few rooms,'' she told the rally through a bullhorn. ''Any of you can do the same thing, and I'm ready to help.'' A Mystery</p>
        <p>Exactly how the city and the squatters worked out their de facto form of co-existence over the last two years is something of a mystery to many people in East New York.</p>
        <p>Asked to describe the city's policy toward squatters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Catie Marshall, said simply, ''It's illegal.''</p>
        <p>Louise Stanley, 53, president of a neighborhood group within Acorn known by the acronym of NICE (Neighbors Improving Communities Equally), thinks the neighborhood basically shamed the city into action.</p>
        <p>''Before 1982,'' she said, ''the city kept saying, 'Everybody's going to get decent housing - we have this program, we have that program.'</p>
        <p>''Well, we brought all that out into focus - and they didn't like us for that. But they had to deal with us, because we were persistent.''</p>
        <p>''We want this to be an ongoing thing,'' said Miss Stanley, a postal supervisor who lives in a nearby house she fixed up before the squatter movement began. ''So it's very important that the Board of Estimate approve it. I have a lot of faith they will - faith has gotten us this far.''</p>
