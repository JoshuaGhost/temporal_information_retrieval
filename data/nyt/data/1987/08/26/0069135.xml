        <p>THE New York City Opera's new production of ''The Desert Song'' is a remarkably faithful reconstruction of the Broadway operetta style of half a century ago. So be warned, and park your sophistication at the New York State Theater door. Most of the audience at Tuesday night's premiere seemed happy to accept the work on those terms. Some sophisticates did hoot in delight at certain moments, evidently under the impression that the Sigmund Romberg classic was being played as high camp or high corn. But no, not really. If memory can be trusted, this is actually how they staged such musicals in days of yore: without pretense to any higher value than populist entertainment. At any moment, one half expected Bobby Clark to come strolling onstage to do a vaudeville turn.</p>
        <p>''The Desert Song'' dates from 1926, at a time when the Western world was undergoing one of its periodic spells of Arabmania. (Mozart and Rossini, you recall, took advantage of the fascination in earlier centuries.) Rudolph Valentino, who had fired the imagination of moviegoers in ''The Son of the Sheik,'' had died earlier that same year. Lawrence of Arabia and his World War I exploits were still a hot topic. ''Beau Geste'' was being read and ''The Sheik of Araby'' was being sung. It was still possible in those days to take a romantic view of Arabian politics, and Romberg was right on top of the news.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, for all its relevance to the 1920's, ''The Desert Song'' is a distinctly faded flower today. Probably the only feasible way to revive it is just this way: To transport it directly back to a time in American theater history when a plausible scenario could revolve around the thesis that all women yearn to be carried off into the desert by a masked outlaw. Robert Johanson's staging does not attempt to deny or dilute that idea. Sets and costumes are splendidly silly and pretty in a Moorish style seemingly derived from old Balaban and Katz movie palaces. Jim Coleman conducted with spirit, though untidily at times.</p>
        <p>Linda Michele, making her City Opera debut as Margot, the carried-off one in this production, was as dizzy and lissome a blonde ingenue as ever a Red Shadow swept up in his arms. The voice could scale the heights when necessary, as in the Saber Song, but despite the help of amplification tended to brassy shrillness in an unfortunate Broadway tradition.</p>
        <p>As the masked man himself, Richard White could scarcely be improved upon. Not only did he sing amiably, but he could throw himself into a prancing stallion's saddle at a single bound and show enough horsemanship at one crucial moment to prevent the nervous creature from galloping directly into the orchestra pit. Mr. White also managed to look alternately sissified and dashing in his double role as Pierre Birabeau and the Red Shadow, aptly suggesting Clark Kent and Superman, with side allusions to Zorro, the Lone Ranger and, necessarily, Lawrence of Arabia. The most heartily cheered moment of the performance came at the first finale when the Red Shadow kissed Margot into fainting submission and lugged her into the desert, returning with her limp form to encore the delicious exit.</p>
        <p>The Romberg score has been slimmed down somewhat, but naturally does not omit ''Ho!'' (The Riff Song), ''Romance,'' ''One Alone,'' ''It'' or the title number. The spoken dialogue has been augmented and modernized, most notably for the two principal comedians, Philip William McKinley and Lillian Graff. Mr. McKinley is a talented throwback to burlesque who portrays Benjamin Kidd, the reporter, as an amalgam of Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman. Miss Graff plays Susan, his admirer, in the frenetic, raucous style of a Nancy Walker trying to outmug Judy Canova. The two draw big laughs, but after a while one must suppress the urge to leap on the stage and throttle them. On the whole, one could sympathize with Wolcott Gibbs, who once wrote of a different operetta that it was all right with him as long as nobody talked.</p>
        <p>In the large cast, Michael Cousins was a bright-voiced Sid El Kar, Joyce Campana a doubly seductive Neri/ Clementina, Theodore Baerg an aptly fatuous Captain Fontaine, David Rae Smith a sputteringly dignified General Birabeau and Raymond Bazemore a witty and burly-toned Ali Ben Ali.  The Cast  THE DESERT SONG, operetta in two acts; music by Sigmund Romberg; book and lyrics by Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein 2d and Frank Mandel; adapted by Robert Johanson; director and choreographer, Mr. Johanson; Jim Coleman, conductor; Sharon Halley, co-choreographer; Michael Anania, set designer; Suzanne Mess, costume designer; Mark W.
