        <p>LEAD: Interest rates for Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, as investor demand was focused on a large supply of new corporate debt issues.</p>
        <p>Interest rates for Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, as investor demand was focused on a large supply of new corporate debt issues.</p>
        <p>Two widely cited reasons for the surge in sales of corporate bonds this week were the desire of investors to earn higher yields than are available in the Treasury market and the anticipation that falling interest rates in coming months will raise bond prices and produce a quick capital gain.</p>
        <p>Investment bankers added that the lack of supply in the Treasury market - where no issues longer than two years are expected until early February - has caused many investors to turn to the high-grade corporate market. ''There is some concern that they will miss too much of the rally if they wait until February,'' one institutional salesman said. New Corporate Issues</p>
        <p>Yesterday's new financings included six new issues rated single A or better, totaling $1 billion. In addition, $500 million of triple-A rated collateralized mortgage obligations were offered. So far this week, about $2.5 billion of new corporate issues have been offered.</p>
        <p>Activity in the credit markets was little affected by the Federal Reserve's late afternoon announcement of a $10 billion increase in M-1, the nation's basic money supply, to $741 billion, in the week ended Dec. 29.</p>
        <p>''It seems clear that the surge in money supply and bank loans in the last few weeks of 1986 are related to the changes in the tax laws on Jan. 1,'' said Stephen Slifer, senior vice president at Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
        <p>The money supply increase was far larger than expected, analysts said, perhaps because a widely followed survey of bank deposits used to forecast money supply has been discontinued by the Chase Manhattan Bank. Despite the big jump, market participants said that Federal Reserve officials had made it clear in the past year that monetary policy is guided by the condition of the economy rather than changes in M-1. Fed Easing Still Expected</p>
        <p>Although the December surge in money supply growth exceeds the Federal Reserve's targets, many economists doubt that this will prevent the Fed from easing monetary policy and encouraging lower short-term interest rates later this quarter.</p>
        <p>John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Company, estimated that the gross national product will expand at an anemic rate of one-half of 1 percent in the first half of 1987, with a 25 percent chance of a recession. Stimulus from lower interest rates, tax revision and revitalized consumer spending will produce better growth in the second half, he said, estimating growth for the entire year of slightly less than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Along with a weak economy, Mr. Paulus forecast a drop in Treasury bond yields to 6 1/2 percent by midyear with a Treasury bill rate of less than 5 percent. Unlike many other analysts, he does not expect any significant upward pressure on interest rates in the second half.</p>
        <p>The Treasury's 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 fell more than 3/8 point yesterday and were offered at 102 1/ 32 to yield 7.33 percent. Three-month Treasury bill rates rose modestly to 5.47 percent, while other bill rates were little changed.</p>
        <p>In the tax-exempt market, securities dealers said the paucity of new issues continued to put upward pressure on prices. Since Dec. 11, when securities dealers were inundated by a heavy supply of new issues, prices of long-term tax-exempt issues have improved enough to reduce the yield of the Municipal Bond Index compiled by The Bond Buyer to 7.07 percent from 7.37 percent. Refinancings Possible</p>
        <p>Although the supply of new issues expected next week is not heavy, securities dealers said that the recent decline in rates could lead to more financings by local governments that are eager to refinance bonds sold when interest rates were higher.</p>
        <p>Robert S. Edwards, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Company, said that ''if yields fall to 7 percent on the A rated issues, it creates potential for a lot of refundings.''</p>
        <p>The potential for a refunding of outstanding bonds was mentioned in the quarterly schedule of financings for major borrowers in New York, recently published by the State Comptroller's office. While the expected supply of new bonds this quarter was a light $1.3 billion with no borrowing by New York City, the Comptroller's report said that total might be swollen by refunding bond sales by the Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency, the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the New York State Dormitory Authority.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the country, market sources said refinancings might include large sales by the Northern California Power Agency and the M-S-R Public Power Agency. A $1.1 billion refunding by the Grand River Dam Authority in Oklahoma proposed late last year is still pending.</p>
