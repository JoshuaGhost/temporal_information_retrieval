        <p>NOW IT CAN BE TOLD? Three prominent sports reporters who recorded the day-in, day-out successes and failures of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and who helped create the legends of Ebbets Field will talk about the good ol' days tonight, under the aegis of the Brooklyn Historical Society (718-624-0890). The program begins at 6 P.M. in the Packer Collegiate Institute auditorium, at 160 Joralemon Street, in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The writers are Roger Kahn, who reported for The New York Herald Tribune and The New Yorker, wrote a classic about the Dodgers of the 1950's in ''The Boys of Summer'' and was president and chief investor in the minor league Utica (N.Y.) Blue Sox; Harold Rosenthal, a sports reporter who also covered the Dodgers for The Herald Tribune, and Dick Young, who for decades was a pillar of The Daily News and now writes a column for The New York Post.</p>
        <p>The discussion, ''Reporting on the Brooklyn Dodgers,'' is the third in a series held in connection with a historical society exhibition, ''Brooklyn Baseball and the Dodgers.'' The society is three blocks from the Packer Collegiate Institute. On the day of the Dodger discussion program, the society will be open until 6 P.M. On Feb. 1, the participants will be three Dodger pitchers: Carl Erskine, Johnny Podres and Clem Labine. A PAIR OF QUINTETS</p>
        <p>Jon Faddis is a Dizzy Gillespie protege not only because he is of the generation of trumpeters that came after and stylistically out of Mr. Gillespie but also because Mr. Gillespie has introduced Mr. Faddis as such in public. Mr. Faddis and Tom Harrell are out of the hard bop style of the late 1950's, which developed more than a decade after be-bop.</p>
        <p>At Fat Tuesday's (533-7902) this week, both men, in their respective quintets, will be performing. With Mr. Faddis will be James Williams, pianist; Phil Bowler, bassist; Ralph Peterson Jr., drummer, and Greg Osby, saxophonist. The Tom Harrell Quintet is composed of Jim McNeely, pianist; Ray Drummond, bassist; Keith Copeland, drummer, and Michael DiSibio, trumpeter.</p>
        <p>Performances will begin today at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $10 cover charge and a $7.50 minimum. Fat Tuesday's is at 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street. OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD</p>
        <p>Helena Norberg-Hodge, a Swedish linguist, went to Ladakh, a Himalayan enclave that is now a part of India and has been a self-sufficient society for a thousand years, in classic Western style: to help the people.</p>
        <p>Specifically, she went to protect the Ladakhis from others who would import modern industrialism and consumerism. Ms. Norberg-Hodge and some Ladakhis founded the Ladakh Ecological Development Group, which she directs. Without stifling change, the group says, it wants to apply simple, affordable technologies to raising living standards, while preserving traditional Tibetan-Buddhist values and a fragile environment.</p>
        <p>How well the group succeeded may be learned today from Ms. Norberg-Hodge, who is here to give the first of three lectures at the Asia Society (288-6400) on ''Environment and Development in the Himalayas.'' (Through Monday, there will also be an exhibition, in the Burke Room, of photographs of Ladakh by Jaroslav Poncar.) The lecture will begin at 6 P.M. and a reception will follow. Single admission, $8; the elderly, $7, and students, $4. The society is at 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street.</p>
