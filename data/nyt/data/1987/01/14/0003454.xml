        <p>LEAD: Soviet officials indicated new interest today in reviving the arms control talks in Geneva, which have languished since the summit meeting in Iceland.</p>
        <p>Soviet officials indicated new interest today in reviving the arms control talks in Geneva, which have languished since the summit meeting in Iceland.</p>
        <p>Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Petrovsky said at a news conference that the Soviet decision last week to replace the chief negotiator, Viktor P. Karpov, with a higher-ranking official was designed to ''make a turning point'' in the deadlocked negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union told Washington last Thursday that it would appoint First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, who served as deputy to Foreign Minister Anatoly F. Dobrynin when the latter was Ambassador to Washington, to head the Geneva delegation.</p>
        <p>On Monday, President Reagan gave equivalent status to the chief American negotiator in Geneva, Max M. Kampelman, by naming him a counselor of the State Department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpov, who will remain in Moscow as head of the Foreign Ministry department for arms control, said in an interview that he was hopeful that elevating the representation in Geneva to a more senior level could produce ''a fresh start'' and pave the way for another summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpov and other arms control officials said the new Soviet negotiating team would not bring specific new proposals to the seventh ground of the Geneva talks, which begin Thursday.</p>
        <p>But the officials said their delegation was prepared to bargain seriously on all issues, including the question of what limits should be imposed on space weapons research, a major stumbling block.</p>
        <p>Since the Iceland summit meeting last October, Soviet officials have hinted in informal talks with Americans visiting Moscow that they would agree to a compromise permitting some types of research on the American ''Star Wars'' system outside of laboratories and even in space. But American officials charge that these proposals have never been formally presented at Geneva, where Soviet negotiators insist that work on space weaponry be strictly confined to the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpov said the Soviet Union is willing to discuss ''the frontier between what is allowed under ABM and what is not.'' He was speaking of the antiballistic missile treaty signed in 1972, which limits anti-ballistic missile defenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karpov and the other Soviet officials described the major obstacle in Geneva as the Reagan Administration's backpedaling from the drastic reductions in long- and medium-range nuclear weapons discussed in Iceland.</p>
        <p>The Soviet officials today also condemned Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger for endorsing the early deployment of a partial defense against nuclear missiles.</p>
        <p>On Monday Mr. Weinberger said he would favor deploying missile defenses ''as quickly as possible'' as the first phase in creating a nationwide antimissile shield.</p>
        <p>Roald Sagdeyev, director of the Soviet space research institute, charged that Mr. Weinberger's proposal ''would totally cancel all the statements made by President Reagan'' that ''Star Wars'' was only a research program.</p>
