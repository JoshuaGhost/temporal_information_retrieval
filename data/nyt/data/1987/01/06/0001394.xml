        <p>LEAD: Gerry Cooney is challenging the temporary injunction that Home Box Office has secured against his fight with Michael Spinks that has been scheduled for March 9.</p>
        <p>Gerry Cooney is challenging the temporary injunction that Home Box Office has secured against his fight with Michael Spinks that has been scheduled for March 9.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Allan Pullin, an attorney for Cooney and his co-manager, Dennis Rappaport, said that his clients would be in State Supreme Court in Manhattan tomorrow to seek ''intervenor's status'' in the case. Granted that status, Cooney and Rappaport then would be able to broaden the scope of the case and, said Pullin, ''we would ask the court to reconsider its decision.''</p>
        <p>Spinks, the International Boxing Federation champion, is scheduled to fight in May in the final of the H.B.O. heavyweight unification series against the winner of the March 7 bout between Mike Tyson, the World Boxing Council champion, and James (Bonecrusher) Smith, the World Boxing Association champion.</p>
        <p>Under his contract with H.B.O., Spinks was entitled to fight Cooney in an ''extra'' bout. But Butch Lewis, who is Spinks's promoter, was obliged to have Cooney guarantee he would remain in the series. When Cooney recently signed to fight Spinks, he did so without any reference to his remaining in the series.</p>
        <p>Ever since H.B.O. announced last January that Lewis and Don King, as Dynamic Duo Inc., would co-promote the unification series, Rappaport has insisted that Cooney has been effectively denied a chance to get free market value for a title fight.</p>
        <p>At the news conference yesterday, Rappaport called H.B.O. ''an unlicensed promoter'' and said that the control the pay cable service asserted, through King particularly, over the heavyweight division, was a form of ''enslavement.''</p>
