        <p>LEAD: Chiat/Day New York has been designated the agency for National Car Rental, which has been under new ownership since Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Chiat/Day New York has been designated the agency for National Car Rental, which has been under new ownership since Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Based in Minneapolis, the nation's third-largest car renter had been served by Campbell-Ewald, Detroit, for seven years. The new agency said the billings should be $25 million. The old agency said the billings should be $10 million.</p>
        <p>The advertiser company was acquired in a leveraged buyout from Household International, Prospect Heights, Ill., by a group of investors led by Paine Webber Capital. Among them were Vincent Wassig, formerly of Holland America Cruises, a former Chiat/Day client, and Hertz.</p>
        <p>National has about 22 percent of the rental market.</p>
