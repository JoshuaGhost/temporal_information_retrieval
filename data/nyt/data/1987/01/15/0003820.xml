        <p>LEAD: MOST Americans age 65 and older do not have private pensions and rely on Social Security, according to a study conducted by Louis Harris &amp; Associates for the Commonwealth Fund's Commission on Elderly People Living Alone. Although their incomes are limited, most of the elderly do not receive money from their children; in fact, they are four times more likely to give regular financial assistance to their children than they are to receive it.</p>

        <p>LEAD: MOST Americans age 65 and older do not have private pensions and rely on Social Security, according to a study conducted by Louis Harris &amp; Associates for the Commonwealth Fund's Commission on Elderly People Living Alone. Although their incomes are limited, most of the elderly do not receive money from their children; in fact, they are four times more likely to give regular financial assistance to their children than they are to receive it.</p>
        <p>MOST Americans age 65 and older do not have private pensions and rely on Social Security, according to a study conducted by Louis Harris &amp; Associates for the Commonwealth Fund's Commission on Elderly People Living Alone. Although their incomes are limited, most of the elderly do not receive money from their children; in fact, they are four times more likely to give regular financial assistance to their children than they are to receive it.</p>
        <p>The survey, to be released today, is thought by professionals to be the first that measures, in depth, the attitudes and preferences of the nation's 28 million elderly regarding their own health care, living arrangements and finances.</p>
        <p>''This profile is a lot different from the popular portrait of an elderly, dependent parent financially draining their middle-aged children,'' said the commission's chairman, Dr. Robert N. Butler, who is chairman of the department of geriatrics and adult development at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ''The fear of the young - that they may be drained by the old -simply has no true basis.''</p>
        <p>In 92 percent of the households surveyed, at least one person receives Social Security, and in 55 percent of the households, no one receives a private pension.</p>
        <p>Nearly a third of elderly people live alone. The majority are widows and are poorer than those who live with someone else. Most who live alone prefer their independence, and according to the study, they do not want to be a burden to their children, relatives and friends. Less than 1 percent of the elderly who live alone say they would prefer to live with their children, but 75 percent have children they could live with.</p>
        <p>Many elderly people are poor, particularly those who live alone. Twenty-eight percent of those who live alone have incomes below $5,100, the Federal definition of poverty for a person living alone in 1985. By comparison, only 17 percent who live with someone else have incomes below $5,100.</p>
        <p>The survey, entitled ''Problems Facing Elderly People Living Alone,'' polled 2,506 Americans age 65 and over by telephone last June and July, after an initial screening was made to determine elderly households. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.</p>
        <p>The very old are even poorer than the elderly in general, the survey found. Those 85 and over are twice as likely to live below the poverty level as those 65 to 69.</p>
        <p>''People start outliving their incomes,'' said Dr. Karen Davis, chairman of the department of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. ''The Social Security check they struggle along with simply isn't enough.''</p>
        <p>For women, the picture is even more stark. ''Because of their historic role as care-givers, women spend most of their life in and out of the workplace, if at all,'' said Lou Glasse, president of the Older Women's League in Washington. ''That means their Social Security benefits are lower than men's, they are not likely to have pensions, and they are less likely to have been able to save the kind of money that would protect them from poverty during their older years.''</p>
        <p>Many of the elderly poor are eligible for assistance programs such as Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. But half of those who are eligible are not receiving benefits. These elderly are often unaware of their eligibility; in many cases, they do not know that such programs exist. Further, more than half of all those polled could not name any organization they could turn to for help.</p>
        <p>''This is a generation that grew up during the Depression,'' said John C. Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons. ''They have an ethic of sacrifice. There is a resistance to saying: 'I'm in a desperate situation. I need help.' ''</p>
        <p>It took an illness and a stay in St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan before Judith May Ulanov, 82 years old, applied for Medicaid at the urging of the hospital's social workers. ''I didn't even know that there was such a thing as Medicaid,'' said Miss Ulanov, a former designer of needlework patterns.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Miss Ulanov is typical of the elderly who live alone. She is a widow, and she rents her apartment in Greenwich Village. She has no income other than Social Security and is increasingly anxious about making ends meet and not being able to get around as well as she used to. ''I've been self-sufficient and independent all my life,'' Miss Ulanov said. ''Now, with my failing health and rising expenses, I don't know what will happen.''</p>
        <p>Like Miss Ulanov, the elderly most fear poor health and its attendant costs. Medicare often does not cover expenses related to a chronic condition once someone leaves the hospital. Ninety-three percent of those polled say they are covered by Medicare. Sixty-eight percent say they have some other kind of health insurance, but such policies usually do not fully cover at-home care.</p>
        <p>''People are often forced to spend themselves into poverty,'' said Mr. Rother of the A.A.R.P. ''The elderly person alone who has Alzheimer's disease or emphezema or the person recovering from a stroke may be forced to spend meager savings or much of a meager income on prescriptions, medical equipment or at-home care.''</p>
        <p>The Commonwealth Fund's panel that commissioned the survey is a 20-member national committee made up of representatives from government, education, health care, business and private social-service agencies. The commission, now in its second year, is spending three years and $5 million to identify the needs of the elderly who live alone and develop model programs to meet those needs. The Commonwealth Fund is a Manhattan foundation, founded in 1918 by Anna M. Harkness.</p>
        <p>The survey found that many elderly people would be willing to do volunteer work for an average of nine hours a week on behalf of other elderly people in exchange for assurances that they would be able to get free help in the future for shopping, home repair and other needs. The commission estimates the dollar value of such volunteer service at over $10 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The elderly are willing to make financial sacrifices as well to assure that they - and all elderly people -are properly cared for. According to the survey, nearly half of the elderly who are receiving Social Security say they would be willing to take a cut in benefits of $20 to $30 a month to guarantee other kinds of help for all elderly people: namely, coverage of all medical costs, coverage of nursing-home costs, coverage of home health services and the assurance that no elderly person would live in poverty.</p>
