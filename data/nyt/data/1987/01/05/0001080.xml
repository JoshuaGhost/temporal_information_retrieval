        <p>A chart yesterday on the Washington Talk page, comparing the Congress of today with the first Congress, misstated the number of standing committees in the 99th Congress. The House had 22 and the Senate 16. In addition, it reversed the figures for the number of days each Congress met. In the First Congress the House met 377 days and the Senate 366 days.</p>
        <p>For the 99th Congress, the House met 281 days and the Senate 313 days.</p>
