        <p>LEAD: America's beef industry is blanketing the nation with a $29 million advertising campaign intended to reverse a trend away from red meat among cholesterol-conscious consumers.</p>
        <p>America's beef industry is blanketing the nation with a $29 million advertising campaign intended to reverse a trend away from red meat among cholesterol-conscious consumers.</p>
        <p>Funded by a $1-a-head fee on cattle sent to market, the radio, television and newspaper advertisements introduced earlier this month by the Beef Industry Council extol beef as ''real food for real people.''</p>
        <p>The Chicago-based council and its advertising agency, the Ketchum Communications Company, aim to avoid any recurrence of a dispute two years ago that swirled around a similar campaign, ''Beef Gives Strength.''</p>
        <p>Certain critics have already said that leggy shots of the actress Cybill Shepherd in one television advertisement recall the Madison Avenue adage that ''you sell the sizzle, not the steak''</p>
        <p>She is featured in two of the four television advertisements. The others feature the actor James Garner. The council has budgeted $19.6 million for 28 weeks of network television, $6 million for print advertisements and $3.4 million for radio.</p>
        <p>Consumer use of beef reached a record 94 pounds per capita in 1976 and then fell through 1980, when it hit 76 pounds. Since then it has shown a slight upturn and reached 86 pounds last year, the highest level since 1978, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Department economists have been skeptical, however, about fear of cholesterol as the reason for lower beef demand. Instead, they point to beef prices, which remain comparatively high while those of chicken have been falling.</p>
        <p>The Beef Industry Council is a division of the National Livestock and Meat Board, the officially recognized body for promoting meat use. The $1-a-head fee was authorized under 1985 farm legislation and is collected by state beef councils from the nation's 1.3 million cattle raisers - a figure reflecting everyone from the teen-ager with one steer to large-scale ranchers.</p>
        <p>While the television spots focus on the image of beef, full-page advertisements in newspapers have centered on health issues. ''Beef has only 76 milligrams of cholesterol in a three-ounce serving,'' said one advertisement. ''That's only average.''</p>
        <p>The council acknowledges that maximum daily cholesterol for a healthy person should not top 300 milligrams and that government surveys place the average serving at five ounces, not three ounces. The advertisement does not contain those details.</p>
        <p>The council says a fair comparison should stress that beef and chicken contain equal amounts of cholesterol. But that irks certain nutritionists, who note that beef far outstrips chicken in saturated fat, which the human body transforms into even more cholesterol.</p>
        <p>''Over half the fat in beef,'' says the advertisement, ''is actually mono- or polyunsaturated. That's why three ounces of tenderloin have only 3.1 grams of saturated fat out of 7.9 grams total.''</p>
        <p>''We consider that very highly saturated,'' said Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is based in Washington. What's more, she said, the Department of Agriculture derived the 76-milligram figure for cholesterol in tests on ''surgically trimmed meat with every iota of fat removed.''</p>
        <p>The Beef Industry Council and the center have tangled before. The center responded to the $5 million ''Beef Gives Strength'' campaign with a 1984 statement that those who followed the campaign's advice ''may be eating their way to an early death.''</p>
        <p>In a February 1985 agreement with Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York State, the council added the disclaimer: ''Beef alone won't make you strong. But beef does provide protein, iron and B vitamins. In a balanced diet with plenty of exercise it gives you a lot to go on.''</p>
        <p>When the campaign went off the air later that year, Advertising Age, a journal of the industry, ushered it out with an editorial titled: ''Good Riddance.''</p>
