        <p>LEAD: William H. Latham, an engineer who worked closely with Robert Moses and presided over the construction of the Niagara Project hydroelectric works, died Thursday at Mount Saint Mary's Hospital in Lewiston, N.Y., after a short illness. He was 83 years old and lived in Lewiston.</p>
        <p>William H. Latham, an engineer who worked closely with Robert Moses and presided over the construction of the Niagara Project hydroelectric works, died Thursday at Mount Saint Mary's Hospital in Lewiston, N.Y., after a short illness. He was 83 years old and lived in Lewiston.</p>
        <p>In 1927, Mr. Latham began a long association with Mr. Moses when he was hired as an engineer by the Long Island State Park Commission, which Mr. Moses then headed. He followed Mr. Moses to the New York City Parks Department in 1934, where he worked for 17 years, as general superintendent and director of maintenance and operations.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the New York Power Authority, Mr. Moses named Mr. Latham in 1954 to oversee the construction of the Power Authority's first major project, a hydrolelectric dam on the St. Lawrence River.</p>
        <p>In 1956, he moved to Lewiston, to oversee construction of the Niagara Project, then the largest hydroelectric project in the world. Mr. Latham stayed on as the project's resident engineer after its completion in 1961. He retired in 1971.</p>
        <p>Mr. Latham was born in Norwich, Conn. He received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Cecelia; a son, Franklyn, of Santa Susana, Calif.; a daughter, Caroline, of East Lansing, Mich., and seven grandchildren.</p>
