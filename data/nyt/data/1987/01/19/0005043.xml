        <p>LEAD: How can working parents avert the kind of crisis that can transform an ordinary morning into an obstacle course? Here, from the pages of a new newsletter, are a few suggestions:</p>
        <p>How can working parents avert the kind of crisis that can transform an ordinary morning into an obstacle course? Here, from the pages of a new newsletter, are a few suggestions:</p>
        <p>* ''Choose clothes for yourself and for younger children the night before - this avoids frantic morning searches for lost shoes and matching socks.''</p>
        <p>* ''Set the breakfast table the night before - a good task for a younger child.''</p>
        <p>* ''Keep a petty-cash fund for all those times that a child needs to take a quarter, or 60 cents, or $1.35 to school.''</p>
        <p>* ''If you can make the morning less rushed, you will find that you feel better and work better all day.''</p>
        <p>These suggestions, offered in a column called The Morning Rush, appear in the first issue of Work and Family Life: Balancing Job and Personal Responsibilities, a monthly newsletter for employees. The eight-page publication, believed to be the first of its kind, is intended for distribution by companies, organizations and governmental employers.</p>
        <p>The newsletter offers advice in dealing with the problems of child care, time management, caring for elderly relatives and finding sources of help for family problems.</p>
        <p>More than 30,000 copies of the first issue are being mailed this month to 40 different corporate and governmental subscribers, including the American Express Company, Merck, Pfizer, the United States Air Force and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The publication is available only by bulk subscription, at a cost of 22 to 30 cents a copy.</p>
        <p>''By distributing the newsletter, employers can say, 'We acknowledge you as a family member, not just as a worker,' '' said Susan Ginsberg, the editor and publisher of the newsletter, produced in collaboration with Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''We believe,'' she said, ''that employers who want to show their concern for employee problems, cut down on absenteeism and turnover, and improve company morale and productivity will find the newsletter an inexpensive way to provide advice and help for their work force.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ginsberg added: ''The newsletter is not just for parents with kids.'' Articles in the first issue include ''Parents, In-Laws, Aunts and Uncles: Older People Who Need Attention and Care'' and ''Conflict Resolution Between You and Your Co-workers.''</p>
        <p>Stories focusing on children include ''Living With Teen-Agers'' and ''What Kids Really Worry About,'' in which the editors asked parents what they thought children were most concerned about. The parents listed the top four anxieties as nuclear war, terrorism, being kidnapped and the possibility that the parents might be divorced.</p>
        <p>But in fact, when asked, a group of children identified their principal worries as grades, having friends, and being teased or bullied or embarrassed.</p>
        <p>For further information about the newsletter, telephone 800-472-5678 (in Connecticut and Alaska, call 203-866-6004).</p>
