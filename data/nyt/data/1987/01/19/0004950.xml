        <p>LEAD: A week before a national election that it seems assured of winning, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government is growing deeply anxious about the implications of a rapidly sinking dollar and a rising mark for West Germany's export-based economy.</p>
        <p>A week before a national election that it seems assured of winning, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government is growing deeply anxious about the implications of a rapidly sinking dollar and a rising mark for West Germany's export-based economy.</p>
        <p>Although the leitmotif of his campaign has been a cheery optimism -coinciding with a powerful, inflation-free economic upswing - Mr. Kohl conceded last week that the dollar's steep tumble demonstrated that ''world economic developments are not without risks.''</p>
        <p>That was probably as far as the Chancellor could go in public. But privately, senior officials are saying that trans-Atlantic economic relations and the specter of a trade war with a protectionist-minded United States could be the dominant foreign policy issues of 1987.</p>
        <p>''We're very, very concerned,'' one top official said. ''We've been receiving the message literally for months now from Washington that we're going to have a big trade problem. And now there's an American President who's not going to be strong enough to resist protectionist forces in the Congress.''</p>
        <p>The precipitous downward spiral of the dollar - last week it fell to 1.84 marks, its weakest level since January 1980, from 1.90 - has highlighted the mark's status as the world's second reserve currency. While an advantage to German exporters dealing in mark-denominated goods, the currency's reserve status has long been regarded as something of a burden, particularly when the dollar is weak.</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, it is a sign of the strength of the economy,'' said Ute Geipel, an economist at Citibank in Frankfurt. ''But it brings a lot of problems in terms of the autonomy of German economic policies.''</p>
        <p>The Bundesbank, for example, now finds itself under pressure to cut its already low discount rate to make the mark less attractive to currency speculators - and to meet American demands that West Germany adopt more expansive policies. But with the money supply growing much faster than the bank would like - at 8 percent rather than its preferred range of 3 to 6 percent - the Bundesbank is wary of unleashing further inflationary pressures at home.</p>
        <p>Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg is known to believe that it was principally the plunging dollar -and not the weakness of the franc because of industrial unrest in France - that precipitated the 3 percent revaluation of the mark within the European Monetary System a week ago. Intervention Failed</p>
        <p>Out of concern for the votes of German farmers, the Government had attempted to stave off a revaluation before the Jan. 25 parliamentary elections. But although the Government spent $20 billion in the currency markets to try to head off the revaluation, investments in the mark and the buffeting of the franc forced the system to change.</p>
        <p>Most economists seem to believe that further adjustments in the system will be necessary after the German election, and some argue that the system can only function when the dollar is relatively strong. Otherwise, the buoyant second-reserve currency throws the E.M.S. out of whack.</p>
        <p>Some of the sharpest concerns in Bonn are that the declining dollar will give American exporters an edge in ''dollar area'' markets in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, while at the same time eroding German markets in Britain, where the pound has weakened against the mark, and in the United States.</p>
        <p>Many German exporters appear to have observed, so far, the time-tested tactic of cutting prices to preserve markets, but a free fall of the dollar would put them under enormous pressure. ''As a nation that lives from exports, we have to hold on to our markets,'' said Ulrich Ramm of the Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Limited Imports From U.S. American exports to West Germany are fairly small and, despite the weakening dollar, have not increased. Figures available through November show that West Germany bought $13.3 billion in American products, compared with $15.8 billion for the comparable period in 1985, when the dollar was strong.</p>
        <p>''There are some top electronics goods that are attractive,'' commented a senior official in the Economics Ministry, ''but there is a widespread view that the American export offer is not attractive enough to switch to it, just because the dollar is weak. It's a question of quality.''</p>
        <p>The Kohl Government has angered the Reagan Administration by turning a deaf ear to insistent appeals to assume the role of a locomotive for the world economy. For Washington, one important test will come when the Bonn coalition - assuming it is re-elected on Sunday - thrashes out its approach to a planned tax-reduction package.</p>
        <p>Otto Lambsdorff, an influential figure in the small Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in Mr. Kohl's coalition, has been demanding that the Government advance to 1987 the second installment of a two-stage, 20 billion mark tax cut, now scheduled for early 1988. The first cut was in 1986.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambsdorff, a former economics minister, voiced widely shared concerns that the export-led boom will taper off sharply this year - a development that could be significantly accelerated by the tumbling dollar. But Mr. Stoltenberg, the most powerful figure in the Government after the Chancellor, has spurned that view.</p>
        <p>At a news conference last week, Mr. Stoltenberg expressed skepticism about reaching an accord with the United States on halting the dollar's slide. Coolly, the silver-haired Finance Minister reiterated the Government's stiff-upper-lip credo: ''Steadiness and reliability distinguish our policies, not hectic reacting to short-term economic variations. And that's the way it should remain.''  JAPAN AND GERMANY FEAR FALLING DOLLAR</p>
