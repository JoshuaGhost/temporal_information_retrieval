        <p>LEAD: The two Lebanese men arrested this week carrying explosives through the Milan and Frankfurt airports may have been part of a new terrorist offensive planned by radical Lebanese Shiites, according to senior American and Italian officials.</p>
        <p>The two Lebanese men arrested this week carrying explosives through the Milan and Frankfurt airports may have been part of a new terrorist offensive planned by radical Lebanese Shiites, according to senior American and Italian officials.</p>
        <p>Western intelligence agencies are reassessing reports received in recent weeks indicating that Shiite groups based in Lebanon were plotting a series of terrorist actions in Europe, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Those reports, along with other information, caused security forces in Italy and other parts of Europe to go on a state of heightened alert that may have been responsible for the arrests of the two Lebanese men, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Both men - Bachir Khodr, arrested in Milan on Monday, and Mohammed Ali Hamadei, arrested in Frankfurt on Tuesday - have known or presumed ties to Shiite Moslem terrorist organizations that have attacked American targets in the past, according to officials investigating their cases. Extradition Sought</p>
        <p>The United States Justice Department has said it will seek the extradition of Mr. Hamadei in connection with the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet to Beirut in 1985.</p>
        <p>Italian officials say Mr. Khodr is known to have associated with seven men arrested in 1984 on charges of plotting to blow up the United States Embassy in Rome.</p>
        <p>The Italian Interior Minister, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, said Friday that information supplied by Italian intelligence agencies seemed to establish a link between the two men. Mr. Scalfaro also said one hypothesis was that they had planned to attack a prominent visitor to Rome.</p>
        <p>King Hussein of Jordan ended a three-day visit to Rome today. Investigators See a Pattern</p>
        <p>Other Italian officials and a senior American diplomat involved in antiterrorism efforts said investigators had not determined with certainty whether Mr. Khodr and Mr. Hamadei were involved in the same operation. Nonetheless, police and intelligence officials in Europe are acting on the assumption that the actions of the two men indicate ''some kind of a pattern,'' the American diplomat said.</p>
        <p>Antonio Badini, foreign affairs counselor to Prime Minister Bettinio Craxi, said, that in light of the arrests Italian antiterrorist forces were re-evaluating a variety of warnings, threats and intelligence reports received in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Among the most disturbing reports was an intelligence finding that five people had or were about to leave Beirut to undertake terrorist actions in Europe. Questions About Means of Support</p>
        <p>Judge Rosario Priore, a Rome magistrate involved in many terrorism prosecutions, said investigators were particularly anxious to determine whether Mr. Khodr and Mr. Hamadei were going to use established support networks that have yet to be uncovered.</p>
        <p>''These kinds of people do not operate alone,'' the judge said. ''They have to have somewhere to hide the explosives and somewhere to plan their operations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamadei, 22 years old, was arrested when customs agents at the Frankfurt airport searched his carry-on luggage and found three wine bottles containing methyl nitrate, a fluid sometimes used to make explosives, according to West German authorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khodr, 26, was arrested by the police as he was leaving Linate Airport in Milan. About 24 pounds of powerful plastic explosives were found hidden in picture frames he was carrying and Easter eggs in his luggage. The police also found 36 detonators hidden in a portable radio, Italian authorities said. Suspicions on a 'Sleeper' Network</p>
        <p>Mr. Khodr and Mr. Hamadei appear to have lived in Europe for several years. That information supports the suspicion among many investigators that a Lebanese Shiite terrorist network is already functioning in Europe.</p>
        <p>''There are indications that a 'sleeper' network of Shiites is in place,'' said the American diplomat, who asked not to be identified further.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Khodr and Mr. Hamadei have yet to be clearly linked to a specific terrorist operation, some investigators believe they may have been a kind of vanguard that was moving into place to set up a new network, the American official said.</p>
        <p>One difficulty in evaluating the significance of the two arrests derives from the complex and not clearly understood structure of Lebanese Shiite groups. The key question, according to American and Italian investigators, involves the relationship between two of the most important groups: Amal, a large Beirut-based, political-military organization in the Lebanese political mainstream that is said to be linked to Syria, and the Party of God, which originated in the Bekaa region of Lebanon, has a more clearly Islamic fundamentalist ideological base, and appears to be supported by Iran.</p>
        <p>American authorities believe that the 17-day T.W.A. hijacking began as an operation conducted by the Party of God. Later, however, the leader of Amal became the chief intermediary and Amal appeared to take over the operation.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the purported plot to blow up the United States Embassy in Rome in 1984 may have involved both Amal and the Party of God, according to United States and Italian officials. Six of the men arrested in that plot were acquitted and released, but the verdict was later reversed.</p>
