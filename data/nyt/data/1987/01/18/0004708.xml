        <p>The Republican Party is expected to decide in the coming week to hold its 1988 Presidential nominating convention in New Orleans. The choice signals the importance of the South as a battleground in the next contest for the White House; only rarely has the Republican Party ventured below the Mason-Dixon line for its quadrennial celebration.</p>
        <p>In negotiating with local officials, the Republican high command made it clear that the party would pick New Orleans only if the city refused to accommodate the Democratic convention. The Democratic site selection committee is beginning its official visit to New Orleans today and will be completing its inspection of facilities about the same time the Republican committee announces its recommendation for New Orleans Tuesday morning in Washington. The Republican National Committee is expected to ratify that recommendation at a meeting in the capital later in the week.</p>
        <p>This appears to leave the Democrats with a choice between putting their convention in Houston or Atlanta, although Kansas City has some strong supporters. The final decision will be made by the national chairman, Paul G. Kirk Jr., early next month. Leading Democrats have raised questions about the convention halls proposed in both Houston and Atlanta; the Houston facility is under construction and not scheduled for completion until late this year, and the Atlanta hall has been criticized as too small for the 20,000 seats the party originally requested.</p>
