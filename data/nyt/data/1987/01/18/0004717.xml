        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mickey Kaus's argument for abolishing the Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause (Op-Ed, Dec. 30) shocked me into awareness that much of my sense of being a free person rests on my knowledge that the Bill of Rights obliges the state to respect certain boundaries of my being, an essential one of them being my right not to bear witness against myself unless I freely so choose.</p>
        <p>Putting oneself in jeopardy by telling the truth is in essence a noble and courageous act, and letting such an act be gratuitous rather than compulsory is our way, as a society, of acknowledging that, of saying that we respect the human conscience enough to give it time and room to operate freely. Take away the Fifth Amendment and we shall feel not like citizens with consciences but subjects obliged to do whatever we're told. And we shall reciprocate the state's disrespect and distrust of us with sullenness and fear.</p>
        <p>And our fear will be understandable, for when the state is allowed to say, ''You must talk,'' it will inevitably add, ''We have ways of making you talk.'' We may have outgrown the rack and the pillory, but not the desire to extort confessions by whatever means are allowed us. And we are ingenious at finding new means to achieve our desires.</p>
        <p>Just imagine the McCarthy-era blacklist brought into the computer age. Imagine cheap and foolproof polygraphs made compulsory. Imagine psychological manipulation raised to the level of a fine art on fat defense-research grants. Now think of some of the barbarous statutes of our recent past and imagine what horrors the popular prejudices of tomorrow might write into law.</p>
        <p>Will my great-grandchild be forced to send himself to jail by admitting he made love with someone of the wrong blood type, or drank a cup of coffee, the illegal drug of the 22d century? Mr. Kaus trusts the First Amendment and ''advances in jurisprudence'' to shield us from such nightmares, but I cannot share his faith. I want that Fifth Amendment to stay right where it is.  JOHN EDMINSTER</p>
