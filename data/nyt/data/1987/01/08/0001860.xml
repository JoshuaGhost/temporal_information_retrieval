        <p>LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it had rejected a request by several states, private groups and others to ban the use of the pesticide daminozide on the ground that it might cause cancer.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it had rejected a request by several states, private groups and others to ban the use of the pesticide daminozide on the ground that it might cause cancer.</p>
        <p>But the E.P.A. tightened restrictions on the pesticide's application on apples, where it is most widely used.</p>
        <p>Daminozide, marketed by the Uniroyal Company as Alar, is used on nearly 40 percent of apples marketed and also on peanuts, peaches, cherries, plums, grapes, melons, brussels sprouts and peppers.</p>
        <p>The pesticide is absorbed by the fruit and cannot be removed by washing or peeling, E.P.A. officials said.</p>
        <p>The petition to end its use was filed last July 1 by the Natural Resources Council and Public Citizen, as the State of New York, the Maine Department of Human Services and several pediatricians and children.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. said there was insufficient evidence for a ban. It said that it had several studies under way that would be be completed within two years and that it would order reduced use and take additional actions if new results warranted.</p>
