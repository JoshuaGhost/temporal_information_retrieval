        <p>LEAD: The San Diego Padres asked for waivers yesterday on LaMarr Hoyt, the imprisoned pitcher, for purposes of giving him his unconditional release. The club contended that Hoyt had breached his contract by failing to abide by a good citizenship clause.</p>
        <p>The San Diego Padres asked for waivers yesterday on LaMarr Hoyt, the imprisoned pitcher, for purposes of giving him his unconditional release. The club contended that Hoyt had breached his contract by failing to abide by a good citizenship clause.</p>
        <p>''Our organization has been consistent in these matters,'' said Jack McKeon, the general manager, in a statement. ''LaMarr was aware of the club's policy and had been previously warned about the situation. We hope that LaMarr will be able to find a solution to his ongoing problem. We wish him only the best in the future.''</p>
        <p>If Hoyt is not claimed by another team, he will become a free agent on Monday. The release could cost Hoyt $3 million. A source close to the Padres told The Associated Press that the team would not pay Hoyt for the remaining three years of his contract.</p>
        <p>Bill Beck, the Padres' director of media relations, declined comment on Hoyt's contract situation. Howard Frank, who represented Hoyt in criminal proceedings, also declined comment.</p>
        <p>Last Monday, Hoyt began serving a 45-day term at the federal prison camp on Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. He pleaded guilty Nov. 13 to two misdemeanor drug counts for trying to smuggle nearly 500 illegal painkillers and tranquilizers across the border from Mexico. It was Hoyt's third drug-related involvement in a nine-month period. He spent a month in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center last March after he was twice cited in February for misdemeanor drug violations.</p>
        <p>Hoyt, a 32-year-old right-hander, won the American League Cy Young Award in 1983 with a 24-10 record for the Chicago White Sox. He was acquired by San Diego before the 1985 season, going 16-8 in his first season before slumping to 8-11 in 1986.</p>
