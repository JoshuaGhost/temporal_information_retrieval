        <p>LEAD: Last February the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy sent a 128-page report to Attorney General Edwin Meese urging him to ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1966 Miranda v. Arizona decision. That's the famous decision that made confessions inadmissible as evidence unless an accused person has been warned by police of the right to silence and to a lawyer, and waived it.</p>

        <p>Last February the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy sent a 128-page report to Attorney General Edwin Meese urging him to ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1966 Miranda v. Arizona decision. That's the famous decision that made confessions inadmissible as evidence unless an accused person has been warned by police of the right to silence and to a lawyer, and waived it.</p>
        <p>Overruling Miranda, the report said, would be ''among the most important achievements of this Administration - indeed, of any Administration. It is difficult to see how we could fail in making our case. We have a uniquely favorable set of circumstances - several decisions by the Supreme Court holding, in effect, that Miranda is unsound in principle.'' What happened next illustrates why it is hard to take Mr. Meese seriously as a legal strategist, much less a constitutional scholar.</p>
        <p>In March the high court, in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an appointee of President Reagan, had this to say about Miranda: ''The decision as written strikes the proper balance between society's legitimate law enforcement interests and the protection of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights.'' She was joined by five Justices - White, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist and Burger, then Chief Justice - who had bitterly criticized Miranda for years. Like many police departments across the nation, those Justices seem to have made their peace with the ruling, though they would strongly oppose extending it.</p>
        <p>What did Mr. Meese do with his aides' report? He held it for nearly a year and last week released it. The document included an addendum mentioning the March decision but not Justice O'Connor's telling phrase about proper balance.</p>
        <p>For whose benefit is all this posturing? When Mr. Meese asked the Supreme Court to overrule the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, the justices ignored him. When he describes as ''intellectually shaky'' the Court's application, 62 years ago, of the Bill of Rights to the states, he inspires mostly snickers. He produces treatises complaining that Chief Justice Marshall skewed the Constitution's federalist design.</p>
        <p>None of Mr. Meese's attempts at scholarship achieve the eloquence of his unguarded response when an interviewer asked, Why shouldn't people have the protections of the Miranda warnings? ''Suspects who are innocent of crime should. But the thing is, you don't have many suspects who are innocent of crime. That's contradictory. If a person is innocent of a crime, then he is not a suspect.''</p>
        <p>In other words, guilty until proven guilty.</p>
