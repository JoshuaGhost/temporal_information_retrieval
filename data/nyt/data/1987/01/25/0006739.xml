        <p>Every so often a disaster serves to remind travelers that they cannot take their safety for granted. Such was the case with the New Year's Eve fire at the Dupont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, P.R., as a result of which 96 people died. It reminded travelers everywhere of their vulnerability and of the need for precautions.</p>
        <p>Because major hotel chains have taken large strides in improving fire safety in recent years, disasters such as the one in Puerto Rico are rare. Among the steps taken by hotels are making properties more fire-resistant, upgrading alarm systems and stepping up safety training, inspection and rescue programs for employees.</p>
        <p>The Dupont Plaza was operated until 1978 by the Sheraton Corporation, which in 1981 introduced rigid fire-safety guidelines for all 508 hotels throughout the world that bear its name.</p>
        <p>According to the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit technical and educational organization based in Quincy, Mass., hotel and motel fires reported to fire departments in the United States in 1985, the last year for which complete statistics are available, declined 16.7 percent from 1984. There were about 7,500 fires in 1985, the association said, resulting in 85 civilian deaths and $56 million in property loss.</p>
        <p>The association publishes a Life Safety Code, revised in 1985, that it recommends be adopted by all hotels, motels and other meeting places in the United States. It recognizes, however, that in some cases local codes or ordinances will prevail. In fact, Roy Harris, Sheraton's corporate manager of safety, said in a telephone interview that there were four major fire codes in the country with 1,800 local variations. ''One hotel code may require complete protection,'' he said, ''and another, nothing.''</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, Mr. Harris, Sonny Scarf, director of fire protection for the Marriott Corporation, and Tom Daly, director of fire safety for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, placed major emphasis on sprinkler systems. They also urged the use of smoke detectors that, where possible, are wired to a central monitoring and alarm system.</p>
        <p>Reports by the association and the National Safety Council and interviews with fire-safety specialists make it clear that while they consider fire-resistant construction and fire equipment to be of major importance in preventing, detecting and extinguishing hotel fires, they believe them to be far from enough.</p>
        <p>They note, for instance, that the leading cause of hotel and motel fires is human error: carelessness with cigarettes or matches. The second-most-frequent cause is arson, which is increasing and can be virtually impossible to prevent.</p>
        <p>This underscores the importance for hotels of good housekeeping and of inspection and rescue programs for employees, and of making sure that guests understand how to prevent and react to fire.</p>
        <p>Obviously, hotels don't want to create an air of insecurity; it could cost them business. But ask yourself how many hotels where you have stayed have complied with this recommendation of the fire protection association: ''As when persons are briefed before flight in an aircraft, guests in hotels should be not only shown to their rooms and how to switch on the TV set, they should be shown where the nearest exits are located and told the characteristics of the fire alarm signal.''</p>
        <p>Most major hotels, often by law, provide such information, plus basic instructions on what to do in case of fire or a fire alarm. The information is usually on a card displayed prominently in each guest room, typically on the main door. But the information will do little good unless you read it. So a lot of responsibility is on you, the guest, to protect yourself.</p>
        <p>Among the facts and precautions that are repeatedly cited by fire-safety experts are these:</p>
        <p>* Your room may provide the safest haven in the event of a fire elsewhere in the hotel. Do not open your door before using the peephole to see if smoke is visible in the hall. Also, feel the metal door frame or door knob, which can transmit heat from outside, rather than the back of the door, which may have been heavily insulated.</p>
        <p>* If the door and doorknob are cool, slowly open the door, using your shoulder as a brace and being prepared to shut it quickly if smoke enters the room. (Smoke, not flames, is the main factor in fire deaths.)</p>
        <p>* If you cannot avoid smoke, crawl to the nearest fire exit, which you should have identified when you first checked in. Never use elevators; their buttons may be heat-sensitive and take you to the main fire floor.</p>
        <p>* After telephoning to report the fire and your location, fill the bathtub with water to insure a supply if the flow is shut off. Stuff wet sheets and towels under the door and in any vents. Shut off fans and air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>* If possible, signal for help at your window but do not open or break the window, since that would admit oxygen and feed the fire. (A free leaflet, ''Be Fire Smart: Tips for Travelers,'' is available from the Insurance Information Institute in New York of; call 800-221-4954 from anywhere in the contiguous 48 states.) The fire protection association suggests that travelers ask what fire-safety features the hotel has before making a reservation. This may be a new idea for you, but the question has been increasingly asked by planners of meetings and conventions. After interviews with 200 meeting planners, the CKC Report, a newsletter published 10 times a year by Chervenak, Keane &amp; Company, a hotel technology consulting firm based in New York, said 64 percent called safety and security ''very important'' in site selection, 33 percent considered them ''somewhat important'' and only 2 percent said they were not important.</p>
        <p>There is no reason why safety and security questions cannot also be asked by individual vacationers who don't make their own reservations but rely on travel agents to do it or who buy packages or escorted tours in which hotels have already been selected.. Such questions need not pertain only to fire safety, but also to the quality of service you may expect in case of political or labor unrest at your destination or damage from a severe storm. Travel agents, tour operators and airlines will often take the position that by reading newspapers, listening to the radio or watching television you should be able to decide for yourself which areas to avoid, but information about particular hotels may be hard to come by unless you seek it out.</p>
        <p>''We recently sent two major groups to Puerto Rico,'' said Arnold R. Tolkin, president of Travel Impressions, a tour packager based in Greenvale, L.I. ''Their attorneys called and wanted to know what the fire regulations were and were we printing something about them -which we were.'' The tour groups made their trips before the Dupont Plaza fire took place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tolkin, who said he takes a portable smoke detector on his travels, said that when any major problem arises at a destination or hotel, ''normally we stop sale.'' ''I'm not looking for aggravation,'' he said. ''I'm not sending people to a pigsty, not at $100 a day.''</p>
        <p>Tour operators and packagers will often insist that a hotel be co-insured - that its liability insurance covers them, as well. ''We won't use an airline unless it's co-insured, especially charter airlines,'' Mr. Tolkin said. ''I've even sent mechanics down to the airport - especially at holiday time - to make sure the airlines were doing the maintenance checks.''</p>
        <p>''We obviously can't advertise hotel problems,'' said Steven R. Heydt, senior vice president, sales and marketing, for Gogo Tours, a major packager, and the related 131-office Liberty Travel chain. ''But if we are aware of something,'' he said, ''we will immediately notify all of our agents. We won't deal with problem properties.''</p>
        <p>American Express maintains what it calls destination services divisions around the world that check all hotels before deciding to use them, Alix Phillips, a spokesman, said. ''We don't specifically check for fire safety,'' she said. ''We check to make sure that the hotel is clean, reputable and meets all our other quality standards. We also insure that it has a certificate of occupancy from the government.''</p>
        <p>''If any of our travelers feel uncomfortable about a hotel, we will move them,'' she said, but they will not necessarily get a refund for prepaid expenses. ''If we can prove that there is a danger,'' she added, ''we will bear the expense.''  PRACTICAL TRAVELER</p>
