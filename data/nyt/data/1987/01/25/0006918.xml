        <p>LEAD: Joseph N. Cooper, one of the highest ranking black officials in the Reagan Administration until he resigned nine days ago, went public with his protest last week.

        <p>His remarks were of particular interest because he had been for the last 17 months the official responsible for the office in the Labor Department that enforces a Presidential order requiring that companies holding Federal contracts have affirmative action programs. Secretary of Labor Bill Brock has been fighting a Justice Department recommendation that numerical hiring goals be eliminated. Until Mr. Cooper's speech, disagreement on the question within the Labor Department had not been known.</p>
