        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>About once every three years, usually about the time of the America's Cup extravaganza, we read that ''yacht racing involves a little more excitement than watching grass grow.'' At least Red Smith, who made the original comment, was referring to ''watching'' races as opposed to racing.</p>
        <p>Racing a sailboat is a participant sport that rarely attracts more than a handful of spectators, which keeps the press at a welcome distance. It is as exciting, as brutal, and as exhausting as any sporting event. The smaller the boat, the greater the challenge, which is why you find that most America's Cup crews learned their skill on boats under 30 feet and frequently on a centerboard 11-foot dinghy. The vast majority of sailors would not waste their time watching others race a boat.</p>
        <p>Ninety-nine percent of the crowds at Newport have been present for the social events, the television interviews, and the photo opportunities and would not know the difference between an outhaul and a cam cleat. Sports fans will ultimately join their Maker; if they were bad, they end up watching an endless hockey game. If they have been real good, they are forced to watch a tie football game in Green Bay, with the temperature hovering at minus 20 degrees. Racing sailors go to heaven; I was there once when I won a race.  GERALD M. BRANOWER  New York</p>
