        <p>LEAD: ''It is,'' said one obviously enchanted guest, ''like summer camp, except that you don't have to sew on name tapes.''

        <p>''It is,'' said one obviously enchanted guest, ''like summer camp, except that you don't have to sew on name tapes.'' In fact you don't have to take much in the way of clothing, or cosmetics. And you certainly are expected to leave the traditional package of goodies -the chocolate chip cookies and Heath Bars -at home.</p>
        <p>Like many summer camps, the Golden Door specializes, too. Its specialty is fitness (most of the year for women, although some weeks are reserved for men, others for couples) with an accent on weight loss through a routine of rigorous exercise and healthy eating.</p>
        <p>The doyen of all health spas, the Door is in its 29th year in Escondido, a sunny corner of southern California where even on days when the fog hangs heavily over San Diego, its neighbor to the south, the sun is almost always shining by 11 A.M. Escondido never gets very cold and it seldom gets very hot; the nights are always cool.</p>
        <p>In its youth the Golden Door was known not as a fitness spa but as a fat farm - because most of the people who went there needed to drop more than a few pounds. Most were over 40. Today more than half of the the guests, most of whom are in their 30's and 40's, are reed slim, and want to tone up. And for those who want to work up a healthy sweat, there are no more luxurious surroundings in which to do it.</p>
        <p>When Deborah Szekely, the owner of both the Door and Rancho La Puerta, a coed spa in Tecate, Mexico, was forced to move the Door in 1975, to make room for a superhighway, she decided to pattern the new quarters after a Japanese inn. The one-story, ocher, stucco buildings, with their gray-green tiled roofs and Japanese gardens, provide serenity and solitude and an opportunity to unwind from the stresses of the everyday world.</p>
        <p>The spacious bed-sitting rooms - one person to a room - overlook private gardens where camellias and fuchsias bloom in profusion. The rooms are decorated in the muted earth tones characteristic of a Japanese inn, antique Japanese woodblock prints hang on the walls, and the parquet floors are covered with carpeting. Although you can smoke in your room and certain designated areas outdoors, smoking elsewhere is prohibited.</p>
        <p>The structured daily program begins with a walk at 6:30 A.M. and winds down with nonalcoholic cocktails at 6:30 P.M. For maximum benefit guests are encouraged to attend all activities. But, unlike camp, if you feel like lolling around the pool or reading a trashy novel in your room all day, no one is calling the roll. And best of all, the aerobic and toning classes are alternated with relaxation periods. Each schedule is programmed to match the guest's fitness level and wishes. Evening programs are interesting but not riveting, so those who want to be in bed by 9 miss very little.</p>
        <p>The typical day begins with a wake-up call at 5:30 or 6, followed by a few warmup exercises and a brisk walk of one to five miles. Breakfast follows in your room, in bed if preferred: fresh fruit with low-fat yogurt, cheese melt with tomato slice or just a grapefruit half, freshly picked from the Door's own trees. The breakfast tray also holds the guest's personal schedule for the day, printed on a paper fan, and the menu for lunch and dinner with alternative selections.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, from 8:30 to 9, there is a stretch class to loosen up for the day's series of 50-minute periods. After that each person's schedule is different. Mine is typical of the more strenuous program. The first session, an aerobics class, is for those in the best shape. It emphasizes the newer, low-impact movements, which involve less jumping and more work with the arms. (The results are the same, with less damage to the joints.) And just at the moment you are certain that you cannot lift your arms one more time, the class is over. Aerobics are followed by body shaping; translated, that means exercises for toning and flattening.</p>
        <p>Juice break, eagerly awaited by all, is on deck at 9:50 when a hot tomato-based, potassium broth is served to help replenish the nutrients lost through perspiration. A basket of vegetables - golden cherry tomatoes, green and yellow squash, purple broccoli, jicama, snow peas, cauliflower (40 percent of which are grown in the Golden Door's garden) - is available for nibbles.</p>
        <p>Next is a beauty session. This means anything from a facial and massage to a skin cleansing or a mask. It's amazing how easy it is to fall asleep in a horizontal chair, listening to the sounds of the birds.</p>
        <p>For some, the pool exercises that follow may consist of swimming laps in one pool; for me they were a combination of aerobic and toning exercises in the other pool.</p>
        <p>Lunch is at 1 o'clock - by the pool, in the dining room or in your room. There is always a choice: taco salad with sour cream, cheese and cumin dressing; grilled Sichuan chicken salad, primavera rainbow pasta.</p>
        <p>My afternoon program began at 2 with either a game of water volleyball or WAC (Women's Aerobic Course), a brisk 20-minute walk followed by 45 seconds on each of 23 pieces of equipment, alternating weight-pushing devices with such aerobic ones as treadmill or rowing machine. Because the time spent on each piece of equipment is so short, a certain frenetic humor imbues the class as it scrambles from one station to another - and the time flies.</p>
        <p>Three o'clock brings an herbal wrap, a relaxation period in which the body is wrapped in steaming hot cloths impregnated with herbs. It's another grand opportunity to fall asleep. Or, on a more active schedule, the hour is spent dancing with a choreographer named Yuchi, who comes down from Los Angeles once a week to conduct a dance class that is the most painless form of aerobics I know. Even those with two left feet leave Yuchi's class thinking they are Ginger Rogers.</p>
        <p>The best activity of the day comes next: a massage in your room, traditional Swedish or shiatsu; and some of the masseuses also give sports massages of the muscles and tendons. It's definitely another opportunity to catch a few winks.</p>
        <p>The final class may be stretch and relax; for me it was super legs or super abs - 30 minutes of intensive toning exercises either for the legs, hips and thighs or the abdominal region.</p>
        <p>That leaves 45 minutes to an hour to take a shower and get ready for 6:30 ''cocktails,'' a nonalcoholic, low-calorie drink with a few equally slimming hors d'oeuvres that include stuffed mushrooms, sushi or oysters Rockefeller.</p>
        <p>Dinner, at 7 o'clock in the dining room, which is done in Philippine mahogany and decorated with Japanese antique art, is served on handsome parquet-topped tables. The sliding glass doors look out over Japanese gardens and a pool stocked with carp. No matter how quickly you may have eaten in the past, dinner is scheduled to take one hour. The idea is to instill the importance of eating slowly for those who want to control their food intake.</p>
        <p>The meal usually starts with garden-fresh greens in a deceptively low-calorie dressing; they are always served with chilled forks, a nicety aimed at confirming the salad's coolness. The entree may be grilled swordfish with tomatillo sauce and rose potatoes, roast Cornish hen, roast loin of veal with shiitake mushroom sauce. No beef or pork is served. There is always a small dessert, such as banana nut ice cream or baked cinnamon apple crunch, to satisfy the sweet tooth.</p>
        <p>At every meal there is a choice with differing caloric levels. In the last few years the Door has discouraged very low-calorie (500 or 700 calories a day) diets. The staff's statistics have shown that guests who take in 900 or more calories have more energy for the spa's strenuous program and in the end lose just as much weight as those who take in fewer calories. And people on low-calorie diets are less likely to keep the weight off.</p>
        <p>For years, on Mondays, the Door suggested the Virtue-Making Diet, an all-liquid diet of 500 calories that was supposed to cleanse the system. Again, according to the Door, this makes little difference in achieving total weight loss. The average weekly weight loss at the Golden Door is 4 1/2 pounds for women and 7 pounds for men; some women have lost as much as 12 pounds; some men, 14.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there are the maintainers, those who get bread with their meals and even butter, not to mention snacks of cheese and fruit in the middle of the day. Insufferable people with pefect figures.</p>
        <p>A short brisk walk after dinner is followed by the evening program: a lecture on nutrition, ikebana, or the most popular of the evening programs, a cooking class with the chef. It is an opportunity to snack as well as to learn how to make some of the dishes at home. Every day there are special sessions: an assessment of each individual's fitness level, making an exercise tape to take home or a manicure or makeup consultation. By the time Saturday night graduation comes around most guests have determined that they will take something useful home with them, promises to exercise more, eat less, stretch before and after aerobics or pamper themselves with more time to relax in a tension-filled day.</p>
        <p>The last evening together, when a certain camaraderie has evolved among the guests, when everyone comes in for dinner dressed and coifed as they might in the city, it is often difficult to believe that the woman who was running around in the Door's gray warm-ups without the benefit of makeup is the same glamorous person sitting opposite. The transformations are startling and exciting.</p>
        <p>Each year there are eight men-only weeks, geared to men's greater interest in sports and body-building equipment than aerobics and body shaping. There are also six weeks for couples. This Shangri-La of spas pampers while it whips you into shape. Not an easy feat. Unlike the larger spas, which in many ways are like summer camp, the individual attention at the Door - there are rooms for 40 guests and a staff of 140 - makes it a luxury resort. For those who believe vacations should be stress-free and rejuvenating, this could be the best $3,000 they can spend in a week.  PLANNING A WEEK AT THE SPA  THE COST  Rates at the Golden Door (Post Office Box 1567, Escondido, Calif. 92025; 619-744-5777) are $3,000 a person a week the year round. Each week's program is from Sunday afternoon to Sunday morning.  SPECIAL WEEKS  For most of the year, the spa caters to women only, but there are men-only and couples' weeks. Men's weeks in 1987: March 1 to 15, May 31 to June 14, Aug. 30 to Sept. 13 and Nov 29 to Dec. 13. Couples' weeks: March 15 to 29, June 14 to 21, Sept. 13 to 27 and Dec. 13 to 20. (Couples pay $3,000 a person.)  GETTING THERE  Escondido is about 30 miles north of San Diego. Guests are met at the San Diego airport; the drive to the Golden Door is about 40 minutes. The spa is about two hours from Los Angeles. From New York, American, Trans World Airlines, Delta, United and Continental fly to San Diego, but only American has a nonstop. - M. B.</p>
