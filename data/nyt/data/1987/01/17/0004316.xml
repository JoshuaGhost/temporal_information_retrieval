        <p>LEAD: ''I have as much respect for a slug as I do for a senator,'' Robert Bateman said the other day as he prepared for a major show of his nature paintings at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>''I have as much respect for a slug as I do for a senator,'' Robert Bateman said the other day as he prepared for a major show of his nature paintings at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>Respect aside, a slug is more likely to be painted by Mr. Bateman than is a senator - or a representative or even a Justice of the Supreme Court. Mr. Bateman is more at home painting a mountain goat on a precarious perch than a politician in a precarious position.</p>
        <p>But to show that wildlife can exist just about anywhere, even amid big Government, Mr. Bateman took a walk around the Mall, that great stretch of grass, gravel and pools between the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
        <p>''There's some rock doves,'' Mr. Bateman said. ''You call them pigeons.''</p>
        <p>Then he pointed toward a clump of weeds and twigs in the branches of a tree outside the Department of Agriculture. ''Most people would take it for a bird's nest, but it's really a squirrel's,'' he said. World's Greatest Density of Squirrels</p>
        <p>Mr. Bateman said that Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House, had the world's greatest density of squirrels. ''It's seven acres and has 160 squirrels, and the normal number for seven acres is 17,'' he said, adding that the reason was the generosity of tourists and brown-bag lunchers from nearby offices. But such crowding has caused fighting, birth defects, cannibalism, parasites and mange among the squirrels, he said.</p>
        <p>Finally, high up on the branch of an elm, Mr. Bateman spotted something really wild. ''That's a kestrel, a small falcon, the peregrine's little cousin,'' he said. ''It's a killer. They eat mainly English sparrows. The sparrow is really a weaver from Morocco, but everybody calls it an English sparrow.''</p>
        <p>On a pond in the Constitution Gardens, Mr. Bateman enjoyed spotting a flock of Canada geese - he is a Canadian - and some white American widgeon, or baldpate, a duck not usually found in the middle of a city, he said.</p>
        <p>Another creature hereabouts is the protester, and Mr. Bateman stopped near one to sketch gulls and pose for photographs. When the protester, who was asking people to oppose the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, saw Mr. Bateman having trouble keeping the birds' attention, he gave him a handful of bread, and that did the trick.</p>
        <p>This happened near the museum where Mr. Bateman's paintings will be on display until May 17, the greatest show of his career, the artist said.</p>
        <p>His time in Washington has been far different from his secluded existence in British Columbia. A lunch and reception were given for him at the Smithsonian, and there was a party in his honor at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador, Allan Gotlieb.</p>
        <p>As he fed the birds on the Mall, Mr. Bateman spoke of his views toward his subjects. ''I want you to know I am not a bird lover,'' he said. ''I am a bird watcher. I do not suffer when a sparrow falls to the ground. I view it as an opportunity to collect a specimen.''  WASHINGTON TALK</p>
