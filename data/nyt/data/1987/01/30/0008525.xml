        <p>LEAD: ''VIRTUOSO should be a title of honor,'' the cellist Emanuel Feuermann once said, ''denoting the highest ability, respect for a piece of art and the ability to fit one's personality to the artwork. I believe that among the greatest names on the stage, only a few deserve this title.''</p>

        <p>LEAD: ''VIRTUOSO should be a title of honor,'' the cellist Emanuel Feuermann once said, ''denoting the highest ability, respect for a piece of art and the ability to fit one's personality to the artwork. I believe that among the greatest names on the stage, only a few deserve this title.''</p>
        <p>''VIRTUOSO should be a title of honor,'' the cellist Emanuel Feuermann once said, ''denoting the highest ability, respect for a piece of art and the ability to fit one's personality to the artwork. I believe that among the greatest names on the stage, only a few deserve this title.''</p>
        <p>Nobody can say whether Feuermann would have allowed any of the various artists performing in New York this weekend into his personal pantheon, but their concerts should provide pleasure for most music-lovers. Piano buffs have their choice of programs featuring Horacio Gutierrez, Christopher O'Riley, Ruth Laredo, Cynthia Raim and Marc-Andre Hamlin; violin fanciers can hear the extraordinary Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Kyung Wha Chung and the young prodigy Gil Shaham -the latter on a program with the Metropolitan Opera soprano Roberta Peters.</p>
        <p>The cellist Ralph Kirshbaum will play a program that neatly balances 20th-century masterpieces with familiar works from the past at the 92d Street Y. Finally, the Detroit Symphony's two concerts at Carnegie Hall offer the listener a choice of soloists - and a choice of two local premieres. Tonight at 8, Mr. Hamelin will play Ellen Taafe Zwilich's Piano Concerto, on a program that includes the Symphony No. 8 of Bruckner; tomorrow night at 8, Jean-Pierre Rampal will play Ezra Laderman's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra. Both programs will be conducted by Gunther Herbig. Tomorrow's bill includes Wagner's ''Siegfried Idyll'' and Dvorak's Symphony No. 8.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it's quite a weekend for soloists in concert halls from Manhattan to Long Island.</p>
        <p>There will be two opportunities to hear Mr. Gutierrez, both in the same work, Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor (Op. 21). He will play the concerto tonight and tomorrow night at 8 at Avery Fisher Hall, accompanied by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Kurt Masur; the program will also include Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3 (''Scottish'') and Paul Hindemith's Concert Music for Strings and Brass.</p>
        <p>The Chopin concerto ought to be a fine work for Mr. Gutierrez, for his playing has the combination of grace, tonal luster, impulsiveness and technical expertise that is required by this youthful composition. Tickets for tonight's concert are $15, $27.50 and $35; only single tickets at $27.50 are available for tomorrow's performance. Information: 874-2424.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow night at 8 at the 92d Street Y (on Lexington Avenue), the pianist Cynthia Raim will play works by Mozart, Brahms and Debussy, as well as Prokofiev's Sonata No. 7. Ms. Raim studied with Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute, and recently won the Clara Haskil International Piano Competition. Tickets are $7.50 and $8.50. Information: 996-1100. 2 Programs With Laredo Ms. Laredo is all over town this weekend: she will participate in the Symphony Space's ''Wall-to-Wall Schubert'' celebration tomorrow (related article on page C3) and - with Mr. O'Riley Sunday night at 8:30 - in the first of four gala concerts sponsored by Affiliate Artists at Weill Recital Hall. The latter program is an interesting one - the world premiere of George Walker's ''Pieces From Guido's Hand,'' along with Ravel's ''Gaspard de la Nuit,'' both played by Mr. O'Riley; a selection of Rachmaninoff miniatures, played by Ms. Laredo, and a collaborative performance of the ''Fantasy: Suite No. 1'' for two pianos, again by Rachmaninoff. Tickets are $10; information: 247-7800. Weill Recital Hall is on the third floor of Carnegie Hall.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. O'Riley has a superbly honed piano technique, he is uncomfortable with the appellation ''virtuoso.'' ''There are no virtuosos in the manner of Liszt and Paganini playing classical music today,'' Mr. O'Riley said in a recent interview. ''If I were asked to name a more or less contemporary equivalent of the 19th-century virtuoso, I'd name Jimi Hendrix - somebody whose playing was completely electrifying, both emotionally and technically, and who caused audiences to literally go wild. Nobody jumps up and down and screams at Jorge Bolet, although he is unquestionably a great pianist. Classical audiences are much cooler than they used to be.''</p>
        <p>''But if there are no classical virtuosos in the old-fashioned sense, there is still virtuosity,'' Mr. O'Riley continued. ''In fact, I tend to think that technical standards are actually much higher than they were 100 years ago. But technique is meaningless in itself. A virtuoso should not be just somebody who can play through the Liszt Transcendental Etudes in his sleep, but rather somebody who has the ability to play every kind of music, with mastery and conviction.'' Harrowing Intensity</p>
        <p>Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg certainly fits the above description, and it should be worth a trip to Long Island to hear her play the Violin Concerto of Samuel Barber, with the Long Island Philharmonic under the direction of Christopher Keene. Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg plays with a harrowing intensity; to this taste, she is one of the most exciting performers on the concert stage today. Mr. Keene will also conduct music by Rimsky-Korsakov, Elgar and Sibelius. There will be two performances of this program -tomorrow night at 8:30 at Hauppauge High School, Lincoln Boulevard, Happauge, and Sunday night at 7:30 at the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts at Long Island University, C. W. Post campus, Northern Boulevard, Greenvale. Tickets tomorrow are $16 to $22.50; on Sunday, there are still tickets for $16 and $20. Information and directions: (516) 293-2222.</p>
        <p>Back in Manhattan, the violinist Kyung Wha Chung will play her first New York recital in three years Sunday afternoon at 3 in Avery Fisher Hall. The program will include works by Beethoven, Bartok, Elgar, Brahms and Richard Strauss. Jonathan Feldman will be her accompanist. Tickets are $8 to $16; information: 874-2424.</p>
        <p>A prodigiously talented teen-ager, Gil Shaham, 15 years old, will play the Violin Concerto No. 2 of Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall Sunday night at 8 with the Israel Sinfonietta, under the direction of Mendi Rodan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaham refers to another era when discussing the concept of the virtuoso. ''I want to be a musician, rather than a virtuoso,'' he said recently. ''When I look at pictures from the 19th century, I see Paganini fiddling away wildly or Liszt playing with what looks like 30 fingers. I'd rather be in the famous picture with Brahms, sitting comfortably at the piano, sucking on a pipe.'' Still, Mr. Shaham agrees that it is ''very important'' to be technically proficient.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Prokofiev work, the Carnegie Hall concert, which is sponsored by the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, will include Beethoven's Symphony No. 4, Rossini's Overture to ''L'Italiana in Algeri'' and a selection of Handel and Mozart arias, sung by Ms. Peters. Admission is $7.50 and $10; information: 247-7800. Two New Compositions</p>
        <p>The two Detroit Symphony programs promise to be particularly interesting, for they both feature new works by eloquent American composers. Ms. Zwilich is best known for the statistical feat of becoming, in 1983, the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for composition, but those with an interest in contemporary music had been aware of her work for years. The new concerto was commissioned by the American Symphony Orchestra League, the Detroit Symphony and Carnegie Hall; it is dedicated to Mr. Herbig. Mr. Hamelin, the pianist, was the first-prize winner of the 1985 Carnegie Hall International American Music Competition. Tickets for tonight's concert, which begins at 8, are $11 to $17.50.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's program, also at 8 P.M., features the New York premiere of Mr. Laderman's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra, commissioned by the Detroit Symphony. Mr. Rampal, who did a great deal to popularize the flute in the 1950's and 60's, when it was still considered by many to be a questionable solo instrument, will be the soloist. Only balcony seats with partial view remain for tomorrow's concert, priced at $12.50. For information about either of the Detroit Symphony programs: 247-7800.</p>
        <p>Sunday afternoon at 3, Mr. Kirshbaum will appear at the 92d Street Y in a program that will include works for cello by Bach (the Suite No. 6 for Unaccompanied Cello), Beethoven (Variations on ''Ein Madchen Oder Weibchen'' from Mozart's ''Magic Flute'') and the sonatas for cello and piano by Elliott Carter and Dimitri Shostakovich. Mr. Kirshbaum will be accompanied by the pianist Margo Garrett. Tickets are $7.50 to $10; information: 996-1100.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirshbaum also has strong opinions about the concept of the virtuoso. ''Virtuosity is more than playing brilliant pieces brilliantly,'' he said. ''True virtuosity is something much more important - it is command, a kind of sovereignity. It means that you control what you are going to do on your instrument, rather than the other way around.''</p>
