        <p>LEAD: Nonprofit organizations fear that new proposals by the Internal Revenue Service will curb lobbying they have done for years to help shape government policies about anything from health and welfare, education and family planning to the environment and the needs of the young or the aged.</p>
        <p>Nonprofit organizations fear that new proposals by the Internal Revenue Service will curb lobbying they have done for years to help shape government policies about anything from health and welfare, education and family planning to the environment and the needs of the young or the aged.</p>
        <p>They are responding by initiating a nationwide campaign that, in effect, lobbies against the anti-lobbying move.</p>
        <p>''The I.R.S. proposals are based either on a misunderstanding by government of the proper role of nonprofits or are an attempt to muzzle the independent voice of such organizations,'' said Brian O'Connell, president of Independent Sector, the country's largest philanthropic coalition. The group is leading the opposition to the revenue service's proposals and warning its members about the threat it perceives. #1976 Law Was Welcomed At issue is a provision in a tax bill passed 11 years ago, the Tax Reform Act of 1976, that puts a financial ceiling on how much of their annual expenditures public charities may devote to lobbying and penalizes those that exceed the allowance. Nonprofit groups welcomed the measure as clarifying their right to influence policy through their studies and contacts with lawmakers.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit groups say the revenue service recently circulated proposals interpreting the 1976 law in such sweeping fashion that the groups now say they fear they could be easily penalized for exceeding the financial ceiling.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the proposals argue that a mention of pending legislation in a research paper or discussion of such legislation at a conference could be regarded as lobbying, or attempting to influence the public and the cost of the research or conference, and could be charged as a lobbying expenditure. #32,600 Groups Are Involved Organizations exceeding their lobbying allowance can be charged an additinal tax and can also lose their eligibility to receive tax-deductible donations.</p>
        <p>The new rules would affect 32,600 oranizations, according to the service, including some nonprofit groups that do not lobby but are members of larger affiliates that do.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. O'Connell, the proposals could be most damaging to those nonprofit organizations and foundations that have been outspoken critics on current issues. ''Many rank among the best because they have been willing to stick out their necks on issues of importance and controversy and they will be the ones most troubled,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The revenue service said the proposals had been issued to interpret the intention of Congress in financially regulating the lobbying activities of nonprofit groups under the 1976 law. The service also said it had extended from Feb. 5 to April 3 the period in which comment is invited from the nonprofit groups or the public.</p>
        <p>The delay in issuing the proposals stems in part from the sensitivity of the issue and the need for consultations with the Treasury Department, said Wilson Fadely, a public affairs officer with the revenue service. Objections Are Wide Spread</p>
        <p>Objections to the proposals are coming from nonprofit groups reflecting wide political opinions.</p>
        <p>''I believe this is not a politically liberal or a politically conservative argument,'' said Edward T. Weaver, president of the Gulf and Western Foundation, who is chairman of Independent Sector's government relations committee.</p>
        <p>The Planned Parenthood Federation of America ''has no evidence that it was a particular target'' of the proposals, said Faye A. Wattleton, its president, but she added, ''However, that is not to say we were not considered when the proposals were formulated because of the long-standing history of this Administration's displeasure with our public policy position.''</p>
        <p>If adopted, the proposals would put ''a chill'' on grants to public charities from foundations, said Thomas A. Troyer, a Washington lawyer who is a consultant to the Council on Foundations.</p>
        <p>The Joyce Foundation of Chicago, for example, is a philanthropy with $270 million in assets that devotes about 25 percent of its budget to nonprofit groups that are active on such matters as environmental issues, voter registration or community development.</p>
        <p>''The danger in the proposed regulations,'' said Craig Kennedy, the foundation's president, ''is that the proposals could reduce the willingness of foundations to make grants for public policy-related activities for fear of jeopardizing their own legal status as tax-exempt organizations.''</p>
