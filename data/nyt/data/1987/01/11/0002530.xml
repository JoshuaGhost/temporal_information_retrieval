        <p>LEAD: THE MANLY ART Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America. By Elliott J. Gorn. Illustrated. 316 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>THE MANLY ART Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America. By Elliott J. Gorn. Illustrated. 316 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>''CLOSEST thing to dyin' that I know of'' was Muhammad Ali's memorable description of the ''thrilla in Manila,'' in which he and Joe Frazier fought 14 fierce, wearying rounds. His words characterize even more fittingly many of the bare-knuckle prizefights Elliott J. Gorn recounts in his exemplary book, ''The Manly Art.''</p>
        <p>In 1889, for instance, the great John L. Sullivan defended his title in 100-degree heat under the Mississippi sun. The challenger, Jake Kilrain, could boast that the famous gunfighter (and future sportswriter) Bat Masterson was on his side, but he had little else going for him. Sullivan stalked and battered him for over two hours - more ring time than Gerry Cooney has had in the past seven years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorn, who teaches American studies at Miami University in Ohio, has written a social history as well as a sporting one. Gloveless boxing was illegal in most parts of the United States in the 19th century, but it stayed half a step ahead of the law and became hugely popular among the working class. It had flourished in England in the late 1700's, relished by the rich and the rabble alike; nevertheless, the rising middle class there declared war on gambling, drinking and ''public bloodletting'' and drove the sport underground. British boxers sailed for America, a country with a far less carefree aristocracy for whom pugilism was a sign of Old World dissipation, ''more pernicious than horse racing or the theater.'' It was left to men of the lower classes (especially Irish immigrants and their sons) to thumb their noses at the bourgeoisie and make boxing, in the words of a New York politician, ''one of the fashionable abominations of our loafer-ridden city.''</p>
        <p>The author captures both the fights and the fighters. In an 1842 match Thomas McCoy, about to become the late Thomas McCoy, had been knocked down 80 times; he ordered his seconds to ''nurse - nurse me and I'll whip him yet.'' Also engaging are the quotations from newspapers, which routinely denounced boxing while reporting round-by-round details. Pity the New York Tribune writer at a fight in 1857, who found himself among ''the most vicious congregation of roughs that was ever witnessed in a Christian City.''</p>
