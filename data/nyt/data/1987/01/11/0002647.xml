        <p>LEAD: WHEN Governor Kean delivers his State of the State Message to the Legislature Tuesday, he will be firing the opening gun of what promises to be the most politically charged year in the Senate and Assembly in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>WHEN Governor Kean delivers his State of the State Message to the Legislature Tuesday, he will be firing the opening gun of what promises to be the most politically charged year in the Senate and Assembly in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>The Governor will talk about the need for:</p>
        <p>* More public and private partnerships to help financially troubled cities.</p>
        <p>* An agreement on insurance changes that would lower premiums and make liability coverage more available.</p>
        <p>* Some way to rescue the financially troubled Transportation Trust Fund so that the increased pace of highway construction and repairs visible for the last two years does not flag by mid-year.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, who control the Senate, and the Republicans, who are in the majority in the Assembly, will be listening to the Governor's speech - and to his budget message next month - with an ear cocked to the political implications of his programs.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, who captured the Assembly on Mr. Kean's coattails in his 1985 re-election, want not only to hold on to that house, but also to mount an assault on the Senate so that the Governor, in his last two years in office, can deal with a Legislature more amenable to his initiatives.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kean has repeatedly denied any interest in running for national office before his current term expires in 1989, political observers say he will be under less pressure to finish his current term with a Republican as Senate President.</p>
        <p>Under the State Constitution, the Senate President becomes Governor if the incumbent is unable to finish his term for any reason.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean does not have a reputation for fighting hard for his proposals, except in election years, and with control of both houses of the Legislature on the line this year he can be expected to be more visible and active in the fall campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Republicans in the Assembly will be more than eager this year to push the proposals the Governor wants, knowing they can get a boost from his support in the legislative process and during the campaign.</p>
        <p>The Democrats believe they can hold onto the Senate and will try to recapture the Assembly - several former incumbents who were defeated in the Kean landslide have already announced they will run this year - and they will be working to make sure that they do not let the Governor or the Assembly G.O.P. leadership put them on the wrong side of any politically charged issue in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>The cannon for Mr. Kean's opening salvo of the looming politcal war was primed last week when two Republican Senators - James R. Hurley of the First District (Cape May County and part of Cumberland) and John H. Dorsey of the 25th District (part of Morris County) - held a news conference to call for transfering consumer credit-card legislation from a Senate committee.</p>
        <p>The two lawmakers said that Senator Raymond Lesniak, Democrat of the 20th District (parts of Middlesex and Union Counties) and chairman of the Senate Labor, Industry amd Professions Committee, was ''singlehandedly undermining legislative action'' on bills that would force a reduction of credit-card interest rates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesniak denied the allegations, called them politically motivated and said that the committee was scheduled to consider a committee substitute for the bills at its next meeting.</p>
        <p>The Senate President, John F. Russo, Democrat of the 10th District (part of Ocean County), wrote to the Republican Senators, denying the requested transfer of their bills to another committee. He also reminded them that the legislation had been scheduled for a Labor Committee hearing on Dec. 8, but had been postponed because of Senator Lesniak's illness.</p>
        <p>''Given our passage into 1987, some would interpret your letter as politically motivated,'' Mr. Russo said in his response. Then, after raising the inference, he added, ''I do not.''</p>
        <p>He urged the Republican lawmakers to discuss their concerns with him in the future, rather than resorting to ''ultimatums.'' Given the high stakes this year, his call is expected to elicit more smiles than cooperation.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Russo and the Assembly Speaker, Chuck Hardwick, Republican of the 21st District (part of Union County), say they hope to find some compromises on major legislation in the coming year. However, they also say they are perfectly willing to take their different legislative solutions to problems to the voters, if that becomes necessary.</p>
