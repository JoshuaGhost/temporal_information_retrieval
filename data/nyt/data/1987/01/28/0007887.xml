        <p>LEAD: Like it or not, and they don't, domination is no longer the name of the Islanders' game. They have had to turn their attention to less flamboyant tactics, emphasizing a stingy defense meant to offset an anemic offense.</p>
        <p>Like it or not, and they don't, domination is no longer the name of the Islanders' game. They have had to turn their attention to less flamboyant tactics, emphasizing a stingy defense meant to offset an anemic offense.</p>
        <p>''We're not dominating,'' said Ken Morrow, who wears rings from the club's flashier days. ''We're just trying to stay in the game and hope for some breaks. It's not the best kind of hockey to play, but right now, it's the kind we have to play. The results of it are that we've given up three goals in the last two games, so we have to see the worth in it.''</p>
        <p>Not even their power play, the only first-rate weapon in the Islanders' depleted arsenal, could save them from another unassertive showing tonight at Nassau Coliseum, where they barely managed a 2-2 tie with the Winnipeg Jets.</p>
        <p>The visitors, it should be noted, pronounced themselves satisfied with the outcome, which raised their unbeaten streak on the road to six. The hosts, who have cringed through a five-game streak without a victory at home, described themselves as grateful.</p>
        <p>''Once they got their second goal, it looked like they were playing the kind of hockey that was going to win the game for them,'' said Morrow. Rival Goalies Impressive</p>
        <p>It was Billy Smith, the goalie who fended off six shots in the overtime session, who earned the Islanders their point in the standing.</p>
        <p>''He kept us in there, there's no doubt in my mind about that,'' said Pat LaFontaine, who scored the team's second goal. The Islanders were granted a 90-second, five-on-three power play midway through the final period, a break that ought to have been their salvation, but a rookie goalie, Daniel Berthiaume, was flawless in facing his first barrage of the night. That the league's top power play has gone 0-for-21 in its last six games is one reason for the Islanders' troubles.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes just working hard isn't the only ingredient you need,'' said Smith, who made his third consecutive appearance after relieving an injured and shellshocked Kelly Hrudey in the 8-5 loss in Detroit and gaining the 2-1 overtime victory Saturday at Quebec.</p>
        <p>However, Smith said the Islanders are at least playing a thoughtful brand of hockey.</p>
        <p>''If we keep playing this way, we'll win the 2-1, 3-2 games,'' he said. ''Granted, we'll lose our share of them, too, but at least we'll be in them all.</p>
        <p>''This is the way it's going to be in the playoffs, so we'd better get used to it now. If you open it up, you're going to get blown out of the building. This is the way you have to react when you aren't scoring a lot of goals: you play it tight, and disciplined, and worry about keeping the other team off the scoreboard.''</p>
        <p>The tie put the Islanders' home record to 1-3-2 in their last six games. The meager scoring also extended their production drought: They've scored just 25 goals in their last 10 games, not a sign of progress or prowess.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should be satisfied with a tie, not in our own building,'' complained LaFontaine, ''but at least we stuck to a defensive pattern and didn't get rattled when they went up, 2-1, or when our 5-on-3 didn't work. But I don't know what's wrong with us here. We should be taking it to the other team, getting mad if they score on us, but we're not.''</p>
        <p>After an uneventful middle period failed to break a 1-1 tie, the Jets took the 2-1 advantage at 2:30 of the third when Jim Kyte's shot from the blue line hurtled between the legs of a besieged Smith. After a breakneck sprint by Brent Sutter with 3:41 left in regulation, LaFontaine batted the game-tying rebound past Berthiaume, who stopped all three Islander overtime shots. BOSSY IS STILL SIDELINED</p>
        <p>Mike Bossy missed his fifth straight game because of a back injury. . . . Tomas Jonsson, who fractured both sides of his jaw in an automobile accident last week, is recuperating at home and is not expected to return for several weeks.</p>
