        <p>LEAD: There had been a lull. Twenty-four hours went by and the Rangers did not make a transaction. Then the quiet period ended as it always does during Phil Esposito's ''why not'' regime.</p>
        <p>There had been a lull. Twenty-four hours went by and the Rangers did not make a transaction. Then the quiet period ended as it always does during Phil Esposito's ''why not'' regime.</p>
        <p>''Why not try anything,'' the general manager said again early today. So he had, once again. In a trade with the Pittsburgh Penguins announced, the Rangers brought Ron Duguay, the charismatic forward who is still searching for his old scoring touch, back to New York. To Pittsburgh, the Rangers sent Chris Kontos, their first-round selection in the 1982 draft who had been playing in New Haven. They made the move a day after they had acquired through waivers Brad Maxwell, a journeyman defenseman, who last played with Vancouver, and it was only the latest in a series of moves they have made this season.</p>
        <p>''Now we've got insurance,'' Esposito said from New York. ''We've been lucky with injuries, but we'll be in for a tough stretch.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to the tight Patrick Division race, which did not, after the day's activities, become any more comfortable for the Rangers. They allowed three first-period goals to the Vancouver Canucks here tonight and they lost, 5-3. They had entered the night in fourth place, 1 point behind Washington and 2 points in front of the Penguins.</p>
        <p>There was one positive note for the Rangers. Tomas Sandstrom scored another goal, giving him nine in four games. There was a negative note: Bobby Carpenter bruised his kneecap in the third period and left the game.</p>
        <p>Duguay, after a day of travel to reach Vancouver, was in the lineup.</p>
        <p>His arrival may be a prelude to more moves because the Rangers are now carrying six extra players. Sources with the Rangers said that Willie Huber, one of the defenseman, was the prime candidate to be dealt.</p>
        <p>Esposito said that when he spoke with Duguay early today, the player reacted ''like you'd think I'd given him a million dollars.'' The player said he was a bit apprehensive about returning to Madison Square Garden, where some fans have jeered him since he became an ex-Ranger.</p>
        <p>''Over all, it's a dream come true,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Duguay wore No. 44 and was usually the right wing on a line with Carpenter and Tony McKegney. He got off three shots in the first period and one in the second.</p>
        <p>Duguay had been a first-round pick of the Rangers in 1977. He quickly became a favorite of the fans. His long hair trailing after him as he skates gives him a distinct look as does his burly physique. He is 6-2 and about 200 pounds.</p>
        <p>He was a member of the 1979 Ranger club that went to the Stanley Cup finals and a teammate of Eposito's. In 1981-82. he led the team in scoring with 40 goals and 36 assists.</p>
        <p>Then his production dropped, to only 19 goals and 25 assists. He was traded in June 1983 to Detroit, and the criticism of Duguay at the time was that he had become caught up in night-life.</p>
        <p>He was traded to the Penguins last season. In 40 games this season, he had five goals and 13 assists.</p>
