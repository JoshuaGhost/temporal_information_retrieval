        <p>Following are the scores released by the New York City Board of Education on the reading test given in the city's public elementary schools and junior high schools in April 1986.</p>
        <p>The center column shows the proportion of pupils in each school reading at or above grade level. The righthand column gives each school's overall citywide ranking.</p>
        <p>Students with a limited proficiency in English who have been in the school system less than a year were excused from taking the test, and their scores were automatically put at below grade level. A single asterisk indicates a school in which 10 percent or more of the students fell into this category. Two asterisks indicate a school that runs only from kindergarten through second grade, and only second graders were tested.</p>
