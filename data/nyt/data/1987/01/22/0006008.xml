        <p>LEAD: Rafael Villa Vicencio was approached some time ago, he said, and offered ''a blank check'' to move out of his room at the St. Clair Hotel at 69 West 38th Street. ''They told me to pick the amount,'' he said yesterday. ''I didn't accept it. I asked them to fix the room I had.''</p>

        <p>LEAD: Rafael Villa Vicencio was approached some time ago, he said, and offered ''a blank check'' to move out of his room at the St. Clair Hotel at 69 West 38th Street. ''They told me to pick the amount,'' he said yesterday. ''I didn't accept it. I asked them to fix the room I had.''</p>
        <p>Rafael Villa Vicencio was approached some time ago, he said, and offered ''a blank check'' to move out of his room at the St. Clair Hotel at 69 West 38th Street. ''They told me to pick the amount,'' he said yesterday. ''I didn't accept it. I asked them to fix the room I had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Villa Vicencio, a 58-year-old Cuban immigrant who arrived in the United States seven years ago, said there were ''a hundred some'' tenants in the 67-room hotel when he moved into the building in 1981. He is the only tenant left. Most of the others took similar offers and moved.</p>
        <p>''One by one, they left,'' he said. ''Some left for $500, some left for $200.'' But Mr. Villa Vicencio has hung on. His only company in the building is a caretaker who, he said, guards the building on behalf of the owner, Max Goldberg, who was sentenced to jail for contempt of court after ignoring a judge's order to stop harassing tenants. Yesterday there was neither heat nor hot water, Mr. Villa Vicencio said, and ''it is very cold.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Villa Vicencio, who supports himself with carpentry and painting work, speaks only Spanish and has no family in New York. According to his lawyer, Saralee Evans of the West Side S.R.O. Law Project, the neighborhood storekeepers are ''the only community he knows in the United States.''</p>
        <p>''Where do I go?'' Mr. Villa Vicencio said. ''Here in New York, there is nowhere to live, everything is full. Maybe if they find me another apartment, I'll move.'' Until then, he said, he will stay at the St. Clair. ''I'm not afraid of anyone,'' he said. ''Why should I be afraid of anyone?''</p>
