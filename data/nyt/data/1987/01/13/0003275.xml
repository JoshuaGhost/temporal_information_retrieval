        <p>LEAD: More than 50 religious leaders met at City Hall yesterday to condemn the Howard Beach racial attack in the third such gathering that Mayor Koch has held to encourage groups to speak out against racism in New York City.</p>
        <p>More than 50 religious leaders met at City Hall yesterday to condemn the Howard Beach racial attack in the third such gathering that Mayor Koch has held to encourage groups to speak out against racism in New York City.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the Roman Catholic, Armenian and Greek Orthodox churches, Baptist churches and Jewish congregations in the city gathered along the circular stairway in the rotunda of City Hall as the Mayor called on them to deal with the issue of opposing racial bigotry in their sermons as the city approaches the observance on Jan. 19 of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. After more than half a dozen members of the clergy spoke, the group spontaneously began singing ''We Shall Overcome.'' To Be Reflected in Budget</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch said he had sent letters to more than 200 congregations suggesting such sermons.</p>
        <p>In response to questions, he gave his first indication that concern about the attack and what it portended about the city's racial tensions would be reflected in the city budget. He said the proposed financial plan, to be unveiled Thursday, would contain initiatives growing out of the incident.</p>
        <p>He refused to detail any of them but said the series of meetings he has held with black leaders, Howard Beach community leaders and religious leaders as well as other private meetings had been ''helpful in formulating government policy.''</p>
        <p>One city aide, who asked not to be identified, said the initiatives would go beyond increasing funds for the City Commission on Human Rights, the agency assigned to investigate incidents of racial discrimination. But the aide would not be more specific.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after the meeting, the religious leaders seemed to share the view that racial prejudice permeated the city. It is seen in the small acts of people that ''add to the incivility,'' said Rabbi Paul Hait of the New York Board of Rabbis, or ''wherever the insecurities of a given group force its members to abuse the rights of others,'' said Bishop Emerson Moore of the Catholic Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Polk, director of the New York City Council of Churches, a multidenominational organization, said indifference toward racism was ''a direct result of a leadership which accepts the marginalization of some people.'' Although he did not criticize specific leaders, he said racism and bigotry ''exist throughout the city, the state and this country.''</p>
        <p>It is the religious leaders' responsibility, said Bishop Joseph Sullivan of the Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, to ''communicate the message at the neighborhood, parish, synagogue and community level.'' Archbishop Torkom Manoogian of the Armenian Orthodox Church in the Eastern United States cited the importance of focusing on the ''level of family'' in erasing the ''inhumanity of racism.'' 'Just a Drop in the Lake'</p>
        <p>The Mayor conceded that such shows of a united front against racial violence against any group in the city were ''just a drop in the lake,'' but he added that ''every drop counts.''</p>
        <p>The meeting guest list was drawn up by the Mayor's religious advisory committee. Absent from the meeting were many of the outspoken critics of the Mayor and some key figures among the more militant groups who have been active in the response to the Queens attack, such as the Rev. Calvin Butts, executive pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, pastor of the House of the Lord Church in Brooklyn. Koch aides said they did not know if the two clergymen had been invited to attend.</p>
        <p>Most of the religious leaders praised the Mayor, some effusively, for his leadership in bringing them together as well as speaking out against the Howard Beach incident.</p>
        <p>They carefully avoided, however, taking stands as individuals and as a group on such controversial issues as the legal strategy of two lawyers representing two of the victims of the attack, the idea of having a special prosecutor to supersede the Queens District Attorney in the case, or the proposed boycott of white-owned businesses to press for improvements in the city's racial climate.</p>
        <p>''We are not here to create further conflict by taking issue with opinions and strategies that have already been advanced,'' the Rev. Carl Flemister, the executive minister of the American Baptist Churches, said. ''If a boycott is going to happen, then let it happen.''</p>
