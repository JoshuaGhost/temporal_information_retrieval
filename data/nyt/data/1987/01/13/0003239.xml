        <p>Following are excerpts from Governor Kean's annual State of the State Message to the Legislature, released today. The Governor will deliver a speech, based on his 95-page message, to the Senate and Assembly on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>By all measures, 1986 was a prosperous year for New Jerseyans. Per capita income rose an estimated 6.3 percent, compared to 5.2 percent for the rest of the country. On average, that meant that every man, woman and child in the Garden State had an income of $17,211. Only Alaska and Connecticut residents had more money last year.</p>
        <p>Income and employment are up because business is booming. During the first eight months of 1986, business incorporations rose 12 percent over the previous year and were 43 percent higher than three years earlier. What's more, New Jersey's rate of business incorporation was more than double the national average. . . .</p>
        <p>New Jersey has spurred business growth by chopping away at the tax underbrush. Since we took office, we have gotten rid of four burdensome business taxes, freeing businesses to do what they do best - expand and hire more people. . . . ...</p>
        <p>Waterfront . . . At the moment, 22 waterfront-development projects, from Edgewater to Bayonne, are either under way or on the drawing board. Taken together, they involve more than $10 billion in investment. They could create 20 million square feet in office space, 36,000 residential units and 2 million square feet of commercial development by the turn of the century. This will create 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for Hudson County residents, alone. . . .</p>
        <p>One of the conditions of waterfront development is that private developers build a promenade on their premises to link the entire riverfront and give local residents continuous access to one of the most beautiful views in this country. . . .</p>
        <p>This year, we anticipate the Port Authority will announce it will pay for the promenade from Exchange Place to Liberty State Park in Jersey City. When it is built, someone will be able to leave the PATH train at the soon-to-be remodeled Exchange Place station and walk or bicycle all the way to the park. . . .</p>
        <p>Cities . . . I believe strongly that private -not public - money must fuel the rebirth of our cities. . . . Just as unending welfare is not the ultimate answer for our poor, continuous government subsidy is not the ultimate answer for our cities. It never solves the problem, it just spreads out the pain and perpetuates it. . . .</p>
        <p>Historically, our cities succeeded because everyone had a stake in his neighborhood. We must recapture that feisty sense of involvement and that pride of place.</p>
        <p>Many past attempts at neighborhood revitalization failed because they were imposed from above, rather than developed with neighborhood support and participation. . . .</p>
        <p>The continued reconstruction we anticipate will come through our existing programs and a few experimental pilot programs I want to put in place in 1987 - primarily Neighborhood Development Corporations, Housing Redevelopment Corporations and Urban Small Business Incubators. . . .</p>
        <p>Welfare . . . Nothing is higher on my agenda in 1987 than an ambitious effort to reduce the welfare rolls by giving our recipients a real opportunity to gain economic independence. Our existing system has failed to do this while wasting taxpayers' dollars; we must fix it. . . .</p>
        <p>We must take the old, abstract idea of the social contract and transform it into a real contract - a written contract - between our welfare recipients and our state. Able-bodied recipients must have the same obligation we all have - to do everything they can to build a future and support their families by finishing school and working. They have a moral responsibility to do so.</p>
        <p>Government must follow through on its half of the bargain, by removing the barriers that prevent welfare recipients from becoming independent. We must provide the day care, Medicaid coverage, transportation, training, schooling and the jobs these people will need to succeed. . . .</p>
        <p>If we are to make any permanent progress, we must reach young welfare mothers and get them working.</p>
        <p>This means that unlike existing programs, we must require young welfare mothers to go to school or to work. With proper child care available, women with infants as young as 2 years of age should be included in these requirements. Men and women all over America are going to work each morning and leaving their children at a day-care center, a friend or neighbor. Women on welfare should be no different. . . .</p>
        <p>Insurance and Banking . . . Insurance rates have been too volatile; we must have some stability. I propose that we adopt legislation similar to a measure recently adopted in New York. This bill would set minimum and maximum amounts that insurance rates could increase or decrease in a given period. . . .</p>
        <p>The Legislature and the department might also have to act if the banks do not reduce the inexcusably high interest rates charged for credit cards. Although some have reduced their rates, most have not. At a time when the prime rate is in single digits and inflation remains low, it is baffling that credit cards are carrying interest rates that are so high. . . .</p>
