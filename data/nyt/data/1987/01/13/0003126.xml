        <p>LEAD: WHILE courts and communities confront allegations of sexual abuse of children in schools and day care centers around the country, researchers and therapists are struggling to understand what causes child molestation and devise better treatment.</p>
        <p>WHILE courts and communities confront allegations of sexual abuse of children in schools and day care centers around the country, researchers and therapists are struggling to understand what causes child molestation and devise better treatment.</p>
        <p>There is a particular urgency to their work, they say, because recent studies indicate that sexual abuse of children is far more widespread and its consequences potentially more devastating than previously realized. A national poll by The Los Angeles Times in 1985 indicated, for example, that 10.9 million to 17.6 million American men have sexually abused a child.</p>
        <p>The cases that come to public attention, such as those involving the preschool in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and the Minneapolis Children's Theater, ''represent the tip of an enormous iceberg,'' Dr. David Finkelhor, a New Hampshire sociologist who is a widely recognized authority on the subject, said in an interview last week. ''We are only just beginning to appreciate its dimensions, understand its various causes and develop and test more effective remedies.''</p>
        <p>Although reliable statistics are lacking on the number of victims nationwide, the 1985 poll indicated that 27 percent of women and 16 percent of men had been molested when they were children. In a survey of 795 undergraduates at six New England colleges, 19 percent of the women and 9 percent of the men reported having been sexually abused before the age of 18.</p>
        <p>In another study of college women, described by Dr. John Briere, psychologist at University of California Medical Center in Torrance, 15 percent reported one or more experiences of childhood sexual abuse, whereas among women attending a mental health clinic, 44 percent said they had been abused. Among both groups of women, Dr. Briere found, those who were abused were more likely than those who were not to suffer lasting emotional effects, including distrust of men, anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies and such self-destructive behavior as substance abuse, promiscuity and out-of-wedlock pregnancy.</p>
        <p>Ann Burgess of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing said 51 percent of male rapists report having been sexually abused as children. ''In becoming rapists, they seem to be re-enacting their victimization,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Various studies among children have shown that sexual abuse can result in depression, social withdrawal, phobias and a host of psychosomatic complaints.</p>
        <p>Sexual abuse of children occurs in all socioeconomic groups and can involve children as young as 2 months old. The abuse can assume many forms, from exhibitionism to fondling to sexual penetration. Those children subjected to intercourse, Dr. Briere said, suffered the most severe emotional aftereffects and more immediate consequences. In a Phoenix study among 311 girls and boys who were sexually abused, 7 percent of the girls became pregnant as a result.</p>
        <p>Other recent findings, some of which were described here last week at a conference on ''Human Sexual Aggression,'' contradict many longstanding beliefs about the perpetrators and victims of child sexual abuse - beliefs that the researchers say have stood in the way of more effective deterrents.</p>
        <p>* Although parents may believe strangers represent the greatest threat and dutifully warn children to be wary of strange men, in fact a vast majority of child abusers are well-known to the child and are often relatives. For example, among the 311 sexually abused children treated at Maricopa County General Hospital in Phoenix, only 18 percent had been molested by strangers, whereas more than a third had been abused by relatives. Other perpetrators may include family friends or authority figures like baby sitters, teachers, coaches, scout leaders, camp officers, ministers and choir directors. Pedophiles are often drawn to jobs offering close contact with children.</p>
        <p>* Boys may be victimized far more often than is generally believed, perhaps even as frequently as girls, but they are much less likely to report it. Abusers of boys are nearly always male - as is the case with abusers of girls - and many, if not most, are themselves still adolescents. Researchers at Ohio State University believe that abused boys may be particularly reticent about reporting the abuse because boys are taught to ''act tough'' and not complain about victimization. Some boys, thinking they may have somehow provoked the attack, also fear being labeled homosexual as a result of the abuse.</p>
        <p>* Most perpetrators are not psychopaths, social outcasts or otherwise notably odd. Outwardly most seem like ordinary, responsible, well-adjusted men. However, those who come to public attention, through abuses that tend to be more frequent, flagrant and violent, are more likely to be antisocial individuals.</p>
        <p>* Among incarcerated child molesters, 30 to 70 percent were themselves sexually abused as children, but the vast majority of molested children are not destined to re-enact the crime, according to studies by Dr. Finkelhor of the University of New Hampshire Family Violence Research Program.</p>
        <p>Dr. Finkelhor, author of ''Child Sexual Abuse: New Theory and Research'' (The Free Press, 1984), attributes much of the problem to how boys are socialized in this country, where sex is the accepted way for men to express affection and tenderness and where men are not taught how to empathize with children. Furthermore, men are socialized to desire sexual partners who are younger, smaller and weaker than themselves, which may encourage some to pursue young girls, he said. ''Women are socialized very differently, and that is perhaps why less than 2 percent of sexual abusers are female,'' he suggested.</p>
        <p>Dr. Finkelhor said many men who abuse children tend to misinterpret childish affection as solicitations for sex. A typical excuse is ''She asked for it.'' Children, in turn, often blame themselves for the abuse and hesitate to tell anyone about it because of guilt and fears of reprisal. The tragedy comes full cycle when abuse is reported to parents or other adults and the child is not believed, as happened several years ago with schoolgirls in Illinois who said they had been repeatedly and seriously abused by a popular male teacher, who ultimately killed himself before being sentenced. In the Phoenix study, 33 children had told adults about the abuse, but the adults had done nothing about it.</p>
        <p>Experts at the conference last week agreed that there was no such thing as a prototypical, ''garden variety'' child molester. Rather, according to Dr. Raymond Knight, psychologist at Brandeis University, many different categories of individuals are now being recognized. Some, for example, may have very poor social skills that impair normal adult relationships, while others are socially adept but sexually fixated on children and still others are socially inept and sexually fixated. The types are further distinguished by the extent of their usual contact with children.</p>
        <p>The various types of molesters are believed to have different responses to treatment, with different dropout rates and relapse tendencies. For treatment to be most effective, it should be tailored more precisely to the underlying factors, said Dr. Robert Prentky of the Massachusetts Treatment Center in Bridgewater. He was a co-chairman of the three-day conference, which was sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>New treatment programs now under study tend to take an eclectic approach. They typically involve behavioral conditioning to diminish the attraction to children and enhance the desirability of normal heterosexual activities. Some participants are taught improved social skills or treated for sexual impairment. Misinterpretations of children's behaviors are corrected, as are distorted views of the value of sex to children.</p>
        <p>A crucial new aspect of therapy is relapse prevention. The men are told that they cannot be cured but they can learn to control their behavior. Specifically, they are taught to recognize their individual cues for sexual abuse and are taught to substitute alternative thoughts or acts.</p>
        <p>In one outpatient program in Canada, described by Dr. William Marshall of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, over a period averaging nearly four years, the relapse rate among men who volunteered for this treatment was 14 percent, as against 30 percent among otherwise comparable men who were not treated.</p>
        <p>A similar program under way at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University is financed for a one-year follow-up of adult men and six-month follow-up of sexually abusive adolescent boys, which the program's director, Dr. Judith Becker, considers inadequate. ''We should have at least a five-year follow-up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One of the most difficult aspects of therapy is getting unincarcerated individuals to stay in treatment. Dr. Gene Abel, a psychiatrist at Emory University School of Medicine, reported that the more pressure to participate, the lower the dropout rate. Thus, he said, the perpetrator should face serious consequences, such as going to jail, if he leaves treatment.</p>
