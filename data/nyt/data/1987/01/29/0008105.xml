        <p>The Directors Guild of America today nominated five people as best film director. They were Randa Haines for ''Children of a Lesser God,'' Woody Allen for ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' Oliver Stone for ''Platoon,'' James Ivory for ''A Room with a View'' and Rob Reiner for ''Stand by Me.''</p>
        <p>The only other woman ever nominated by the guild was Lina Wertmuller of Italy in 1977 for ''Seven Beauties.''</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Allen has been nominated before, for ''Annie Hall'' in 1977 and ''Manhattan'' in 1979. He went on to win for ''Annie Hall.''</p>
        <p>Only three times in history has the guild winner not won the Academy Award as best director. The most recent example came last year when the directors gave Steven Spielberg their award for ''The Color Purple'' after he was not even nominated by the academy. Sydney Pollack won director and picture Oscars last year for ''Out of Africa.''</p>
        <p>The 39th guild awards will be announced March 7.</p>
