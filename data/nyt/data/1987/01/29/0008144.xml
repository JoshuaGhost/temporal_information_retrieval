        <p>LEAD: A key civilian leader of the Nicaraguan rebel movement has told State Department officials and his political associates that he intends to resign, sources close to him said today.</p>
        <p>A key civilian leader of the Nicaraguan rebel movement has told State Department officials and his political associates that he intends to resign, sources close to him said today.</p>
        <p>The resignation threat stems from intense infighting within the rebel movement that pits the rebel civilian leader, Arturo Cruz, against a stronger, larger faction led by Adolfo Calero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz's departure, if it occurs, would be a severe blow to the tenuous coalition of disparate rebel groups that was formed at the urging of United States officials in 1985. It could also jeopardize the Administration request for $105 million in renewed military aid for the rebels, which will be debated in Congress later this year.</p>
        <p>In the past, key members of Congress have made renewed financing contingent on the unification of the rebel groups. The popularity of Mr. Cruz, an economist and former Sandinista Ambassador to Washington, was instrumental in obtaining $127 million in American aid for the rebels, known as contras, over the last two years.</p>
        <p>Sources close to Mr. Cruz said he told Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams at a meeting in Washington on Friday that he had decided to resign because he believed the rebel organization was still unfairly dominated by the leaders of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the rebel army headed by Mr. Calero that was formed by the Central Intelligence Agency in Honduras five years ago.</p>
        <p>In their conversation, Mr. Cruz complained that these leaders are closely linked to the C.I.A. Together, he contended, the leaders of the Democratic Force and the C.I.A. have blocked changes agreed upon last May that would put the military under civilian control, democratize the rebel movement and add a political-diplomatic dimension to their struggle through its umbrella organization, the United Nicaraguan Opposition, these sources said. Political Changes Urged</p>
        <p>Several rebel leaders and United States officials have said the movement can never succeed without political changes that make the contras more popular inside Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>Both parties in Congress have also urged rebel leaders to broaden their political base beyond the conservative Nicaraguan Democratic Force, whose leaders include several former supporters of Anastasio Somoza, the right-wing dictator who was overthrown by the Sandinistas in 1979.</p>
        <p>The sources close to Mr. Cruz stressed that he had not yet resigned, and they noted that he had threatened resignation before. But he has cleared out his desk in the Miami office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams told him that he should stay on, and promised to do what he could to insure more American support for the rebel political changes, these sources said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz, reached by phone at his home in Miami, said, ''At this point in time, I have not resigned.'' But he added, ''I will not allow myself to become hostage to an unbearable situation.''</p>
        <p>He declined comment on reports that he had told Mr. Abrams he was resigning, but he confirmed that he had removed his belongings from the Miami headquarters of the contras last week, ''in order to work in my house.''</p>
        <p>He did not dispute statements by colleagues that he was deeply frustrated and physically exhausted. He said he wanted to take some time to write.</p>
        <p>He denied press reports that he asked Mr. Abrams for the resignation of Mr. Calero.</p>
        <p>''That's totally cockeyed, totally ludicrous,'' he said. ''I haven't asked for anyone's resignation. Whatever problems we may have in the Nicaraguan opposition, it's among Nicaraguans and calls for solutions by Nicaraguans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cruz said he had set no conditions for remaining in the organization. ''I am not negotiating anything,'' he said. ''I am not playing a crisis game.''</p>
        <p>His remarks come less than a week after the seven commanders of the contra groups in southern Nicaragua issued a communique, which was distributed on Tuesday in Costa Rica, announcing their withdrawal from the United Nicaraguan Opposition because they had received no American military aid.</p>
