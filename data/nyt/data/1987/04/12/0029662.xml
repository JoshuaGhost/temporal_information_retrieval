        <p>LEAD: Tonight was one of those nights when they couldn't get tomorrow off their minds. With both Washington goals essentially scored by Islanders, it was the kind of game they wanted to forget.</p>
        <p>Tonight was one of those nights when they couldn't get tomorrow off their minds. With both Washington goals essentially scored by Islanders, it was the kind of game they wanted to forget.</p>
        <p>''This game isn't the pivotal one,'' said the Islanders' Kelly Hrudey after absorbing his second loss, 2-0, in the three games of this playoff series with Washington. ''I can't see it giving them the edge on us, and I can't see it slowing us down. We've got tomorrow to even things back up again.''</p>
        <p>Hrudey, in the form he has displayed throughout this series, was not prone to making mistakes, even though the Islanders wound up trailing, 2-1, in the four-of-seven-game series. The first Capital goal came on the redirection of a pass that wasn't ever intended to challenge Hrudey. But it turned out that this first-period happenstance created the winning goal when Larry Murphy's pass was deflected into the net by the stick of an Islander defenseman, Gord Dineen.</p>
        <p>''There was absolutely nothing I could do on that one,'' said Hrudey, who watched Murphy wind up for his pass and then did a double-take as the puck skidded along the shaft of Dineen's stick, changed direction, and soared above his right shoulder into the top corner of the net.</p>
        <p>''I guess I needed to be one shot better, but other than that, I can't see what more I could've done with my game,'' Hrudey said. ''It was just one of those flukey goals that's typical of the playoffs. The decisive ones are hardly ever the perfect tic-tac-toe ones.''</p>
        <p>The Capitals nursed Murphy's goal all through the game until Hrudey was pulled for the final minute in favor of an additional Islander skater. Washington got the puck and Gaetan Duchesne, a problem even when the Islander net was guarded, began to sprint toward the vacant goal.</p>
        <p>Alan Kerr, who had three of his own shots stopped by Bob Mason, a rookie, in the course of his shutout, couldn't bear to watch Duchesne ruin the Islanders' crack at a comeback. He was too far away to attempt a body check, and he didn't notice his teammate, Steve Konroyd, sliding across the crease in position to poke the puck away from Duchesne. Kerr could think of no better preventative strategy than to throw his stick at Duchesne along the ice.</p>
        <p>What he didn't know was that because the breakaway took place on an empty net, the Capitals would be granted an automatic goal. With 28 seconds left in the third period, play was stopped just long enough to make an adjustment on the scoreboard. Duchesne, who never actually took a shot, improved his club's lead to 2-0.</p>
        <p>''I did it consciously; I knew he was going to score for sure and I couldn't think of any other way to stop him. I threw my stick before I saw Steve moving toward him,'' said Kerr, who this year played his first full season as an Islander.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know for sure what the penalty would be; it was just a reaction play on my part, and it was the wrong play. We'll just have to get them tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who face the Capital again Sunday night, were revisited by a familiar problem tonight at Nassau Coliseum, and it was a most inopportune evening for their offensive woes to resurface.</p>
        <p>Until desperation descended in the third period, they hardly took any shots, not the best of ways to intimidate a goalie making his playoff debut, and they left Mason looking like a star. The Islanders had not suffered a playoff shutout since the were blanked, 1-0, by the Flyers in 1985.</p>
        <p>As all the participants had predicted, this continues to be a series whose games are close as can be, but the Islanders' continuing struggle around the net - a struggle intensified by the absence of Mike Bossy and Brent Sutter - has made Washington's patient, defense-oriented style all the more successful.</p>
        <p>''We're very happy winning 1-0,'' said Duchesne. ''When we're playing our system, which is disciplined defense, one goal is enough for us.''</p>
