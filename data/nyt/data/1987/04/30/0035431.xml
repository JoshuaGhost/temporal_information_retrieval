        <p>LEAD: Sheldon R. Erikson is preparing to take over tomorrow as president and chief executive of the Western Company of North America, an oilfield services concern that has not had a profitable quarter since the end of 1982.</p>
        <p>Sheldon R. Erikson is preparing to take over tomorrow as president and chief executive of the Western Company of North America, an oilfield services concern that has not had a profitable quarter since the end of 1982.</p>
        <p>''Western is a survivor,'' the 44-year-old Mr. Erikson said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ''And if you're a survivor in this industry, I think things will be very attractive down the road. The question is, 'How do you survive in the meantime?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Erikson, the former president of Joy Petroleum Equipment of Houston, will succeed H. E. Chiles, who founded Western in 1939 and who will remain as chairman of the Fort Worth company.</p>
        <p>''With a little market cooperation, and cooperation from our lenders, in any situation like this, you have to learn to adapt to the market as it is today,'' Mr. Erikson said. ''I don't think there is a set plan. It's kind of back to basics.''</p>
        <p>A native of Winnetka, Ill., Mr. Erikson graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in engineering and economics. After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1970, he joined Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton as a management consultant.</p>
        <p>After serving as general manager of the mining products department of the General Electric Company's metallurgical business division from 1975 to 1980, he moved to Hoover Universal Inc., where he served as group vice president of the plastic and chemical group for two years.</p>
        <p>Before joining Joy Petroleum, Mr. Erikson spent four years at NL Industries in Houston as president of its oilfield services group and executive vice president and chief operating officer of its Digicon Inc. subsidiary.</p>
