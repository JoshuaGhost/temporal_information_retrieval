        <p>LEAD: Lots of money is spent fighting over a few children in our society - Baby M, Baby Jane Doe, the sons and daughters in divorce custody wars.</p>
        <p>Lots of money is spent fighting over a few children in our society - Baby M, Baby Jane Doe, the sons and daughters in divorce custody wars.</p>
        <p>And then there are children you can't give away. Their pictures cover the walls at the Westfield office of the Spaulding agency, which specializes in hard-to-place cases.</p>
        <p>The waiting time to adopt a healthy white baby through the state is eight years; there is no one for many of the children on the walls. Last year the agency placed 44; nine months into this fiscal year, 18 have been placed. ''We're not having a good year,'' said John Boyne, the director.</p>
        <p>Funny thing, it is not the well-to-do who adopt the hard-to-place, it is mainly the working class. ''I don't know why,'' said Mr. Boyne. ''I suppose it's a matter of values.'' James and Mattie Ellis have adopted three. He is a sheet metal worker, she is an aircraft factory foreman. The Ellises had raised a son, Michael, who is now in the Army, and Mr. Ellis wasn't sure he wanted to start over.  $ ? * * *</p>
        <p>''It was more or less the old lady hit me with the idea,'' he said. ''I said, 'you sure?' ''</p>
        <p>When they walked in the office, Mr. Ellis felt nervous. ''They ain't going to let us adopt no kid,'' he said. ''You always think the worst.</p>
        <p>Then I saw they had a whole wall of nothing but kids that need a home.''</p>
        <p>''Wallpaper of children's faces,'' said Mrs. Ellis.</p>
        <p>''If I had money -say I got lucky and hit the Pick-6,'' said Mr. Ellis, ''two types of people I'd look out for. The elderly and the kids.''</p>
        <p>They wanted a black child, because they are black. ''I would take a child that was slightly retarded, but I didn't want a totally retarded child,'' said Mrs. Ellis. ''I said I didn't mind physical handicaps.''</p>
        <p>Angelina was first. Her mother was a drug addict. The girl was put in a foster home as a baby. At 5, she still wore Pampers.</p>
        <p>Later came Jason, 6, and Pebbles, 3, brother and sister. Their mother was schizophrenic. They had been advertised as Thursday's Children on television, but no one responded. ''Jason was looked at by a family, but rejected,'' said Hermine Brug, a social worker. ''Too low an I.Q.''</p>
        <p>Angelina was brought for a trial visit two years ago. Mr. Ellis got off work early and sat on the porch, waiting. ''We were looking for the state car,'' said Mr. Ellis. ''I saw Angelina. I said, 'Yeah, the old lady's going to love her. She ain't going nowhere.' I just know my old lady.''</p>
        <p>When Angelina saw this was her home for good, she stopped bed-wetting. Lengthy therapy had been planned, but after two sessions, she was done. ''There is something magic in that house,'' said Mrs. Brug.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ellis bought workbooks for Angelina and the girl did so well on screening tests, she skipped kindergarten.</p>
        <p>''The old lady's smart,'' said Mr. Ellis. ''She'll be playing a game with them, but she's teaching them all the time. I'm a little easier.''</p>
        <p>''He's a pushover,'' said Mrs. Ellis. ''Well, you know, I holler a lot,'' said Mr. Ellis.</p>
        <p>Not everything goes right. In bad moments Mr. Ellis thinks, ''I've done my share, why are we doing this again?'' Jason has quiet spells, and Mrs. Ellis has to work at bringing him out. Pebbles recently stopped up the toilet. ''Nothing too bad,'' said Mr. Ellis.</p>
        <p>At the Ellis home, there is routine. Supper is at 6, bath time at 8, bedtime at 9. Sunday, it's always church. ''Everyone brush their teeth? Put lotion on?'' Mrs. Ellis said last Sunday. ''Mommy said, everybody go to the bathroom now,'' Angelina yelled. When it was time, Mr. Ellis shouted, ''All right you monsters, out the front door.''</p>
        <p>On the way to church everyone talked about what they knew. Angelina was going to take a test to see if she could move into the next reading group. Pebbles said she could spell Jason's name - she could - but not her own.</p>
        <p>''I know my colors,'' said Jason. The sun was bright and the forsythia were in full bloom along the highway. ''Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow,'' said Jason.</p>
        <p>At Pilgrim Baptist Church in Newark, the singing was spirited. People say their ''amens'' loud, not swallowing them like they do at some churches.</p>
        <p>''Jesus was just a common man!'' said the assistant pastor, Clarence Thomas. ''Yes!'' said Mr. Ellis. ''Yes!'' ''One you'd probably pass by, without noticing on any street corner,'' said the pastor. ''Yes,'' said Mr. Ellis. The collection plate was passed twice, and each time the children put in quarters. ''We tell them, there are poor people, aren't as lucky as we are,'' said Mr. Ellis.</p>
        <p>After church, everyone wanted ice cream, but Mrs. Ellis had dinner ready: baked ham, macaroni and sweet peas. Each had a cleanup chore. Pebbles handed Angelina dishes to wash; Jason did counters.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Ellis took them out for ice cream at the Magic Fountain, their usual place, and everyone ordered strawberry sundaes, all five Ellises.</p>
