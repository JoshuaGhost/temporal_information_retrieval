        <p>LEAD: THE rain splattering the windowpanes added some notes Handel never wrote, but the New York Harp Ensemble played on and Eva Marton lifted her glorious voice above it all at Monday night's musicale in Jenifer and George Lang's West Side apartment.

        <p>THE rain splattering the windowpanes added some notes Handel never wrote, but the New York Harp Ensemble played on and Eva Marton lifted her glorious voice above it all at Monday night's musicale in Jenifer and George Lang's West Side apartment. Then the guests - who included Marion and Elie Wiesel, Renate Ponsold and Robert Motherwell, Dietlinde and Lorin Maazel, Shirley and Milton Glaser, Peter Jennings, Tom Margittai and Vera Stern - trooped in the rain to the Cafe des Artistes for a dinner celebrating the restaurant's 70th anniversary.</p>
        <p>''April 7th is the real anniversary,'' explained Mr. Lang, the restaurant's owner, ''and we'll be sending 70 care packages to needy people in the neighborhood, which I thought is the real way to celebrate. But I realized I should also give a party, the kind I've always dreamt about: a 19th-century salon.''</p>
        <p>''Music was originally to be played in a room,'' he added, ''so I always dreamt about combining music and food. I thought this would be the perfect occasion.''</p>
        <p>He and the chef, Andre Guillau, had devised a menu that might have been served in 1917. It started with turtle soup and progressed through seafood in pastry shells to tenderloin of beef and ended with chocolate tortes.</p>
        <p>After everyone was sated with food and wine, Isaac Stern stood up to remind the guests of another reason for the party: to encourage donations to Carnegie Hall's capital campaign, which is $8 million short of its $62.8 million goal.</p>
        <p>''Until three hours ago,'' he said, ''I was a little diffident about asking for money. Then I heard that a van Gogh painting had been sold for $39.9 million.'' HEDDA ''WHOPPER,'' in a big black hat, was there with her notebook. Nick and Nora Charles brought along a plush Asta, and Charlie Chan sauntered in with Anna May Wong. But when ''Nancy and Ronald Reagan'' walked in, the party hit its stride.</p>
        <p>Some 80 devotees of old Hollywood movies had done themselves up as their favorite 1940's characters on Wednesday night and headed for Nat and Vivian Serota's Park Avenue apartment. They were there to celebrate the formation of DayLight for DayTop, a volunteer group of young adults to work with drug addicts. The Serotas and their co-hosts, Etan Merrick and Diane Terman Felenstein, decided to celebrate by having fun.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Serota got done up as Rita Hayworth in pink sequins and marabou feathers, while her husband was Robert Preston as the Music Man in plaid suit and straw boater. Mrs. Felenstein was Ginger Rogers in white silk and feathers, while her husband, Marshall, put on top hat and tails. ''I'm supposed to be Fred Astaire,'' he said, ''but I think I look more like Harry Richman.''</p>
        <p>Other look-alikes: Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Olivia de Havilland, Marilyn Monroe (in multiple), Grace Kelly, the Invisible Man (face swathed in bandages), Gary Cooper, Sonja Henie (with ice skates over her shoulder) and Mae West. A redhead with a gardenia in her upswept hairdo announced: ''I'm Andrea King, the queen of B movies.'' Regine and Liliane Montevecchi were there as themselves while Livia Sylva, the essence of 1940's movie star in a figure-hugging red dress, white mink coat and elaborate jewelry, said, ''I'm a woman of today.'' ISAAC STERN had a busy Monday evening. Before the Lang dinner, he was at the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center to be named a Lion of the Performing Arts, along with 21 other achievers. Among those presented with lion's head medallions on green ribbons were Cy Coleman, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Philip Glass, Suzanne Farrell, Vladimir Horowitz, Joseph Papp, Marian McPartland, Ellen Stewart and Edward Villella.</p>
        <p>Before cocktails in the reading room and dinner in the main gallery catered by Tavern on the Green, Mr. Stern treated the 200 guests to his violin virtuosity. James Levine was supposed to accompany him but had fallen victim to tendinitis. The pianist Yefim Bronfman substituted.</p>
        <p>Guests who stopped by a display of Toscanini memorabilia may have noticed a letter to the maestro from Bruno Walter, advising him to try a vegetarian diet to alleviate chronic arm pain. ''Maybe someone should show this to James Levine,'' suggested Jean Bowen of the library's music division.</p>
