        <p>LEAD: THE United States has been blessed with a more than adequate food supply, the best and purest food supply in the world. In America, the lowest number of hours in the entire world go into securing food for a family -and therein lies the problem.</p>
        <p>THE United States has been blessed with a more than adequate food supply, the best and purest food supply in the world. In America, the lowest number of hours in the entire world go into securing food for a family -and therein lies the problem.</p>
        <p>Why is there a problem? The issue is so very complicated that there is no simple answer: No one person or one methodology is going to solve it. Following are some observations on the current state of agriculture in the United States.</p>
        <p>The farmer is like a man with a wealthy uncle, in this case the Federal Government. When things have got tough, the uncle has taken over, bought the farmer's crops, at a low price, and put them in storage. The uncle could then release them in times of shortages, or as soon as the price started to rise. Therefore, in recent years, the farmer has never been able to make an adequate living because the farmer's price has not risen.</p>
        <p>Another way to view the problem is that with Government handouts the farmer is very similar to a welfare recipient. As soon as he receives his Government subsidy check, he becomes more and more in need of the Government check.</p>
        <p>We have reached the point where some of our more sophisticated, better-educated farmers, especially in the Middle West and West, spend the greatest portion of their time farming the agricultural policy of the country. Instead of using their knowledge and expertise to figure out how to produce crops at a lower cost, many farmers sit at their desks for hours working on ways to secure more money from the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>In talking with friends in Kansas who have large farm operations, I jokingly accuse them of receiving welfare. They did not deny this and simply stated that they could make more money from their operations by working out solutions to acquire more Federal dollars.</p>
        <p>''Wouldn't you be better off spending the time on lowering your cost per unit?'' I asked. Their answer: ''Well, we could not get nearly as much return on our time and investment by working on lowering our costs. We might lower our costs by $20 per acre, but if we spend the same time on the Government program, we can receive $200 per acre.''</p>
        <p>This is a deplorable situation and one that we in the East have faced, but to a lesser extent.</p>
        <p>Are there solutions? Yes, but they won't be easy. We cannot expect to phase out our agricultural problems overnight, just as we have not been able to solve our welfare problems overnight. However, we must try.</p>
        <p>We must work out a gradual Government phase-out and, at the same time, accomplish a major shift in emphasis on our farms and in our agricultural communities.</p>
        <p>We have long relied on efficiency of scale. We have farmed more acres, with larger tractors, we have used more fertilizer and more pesticides - and more grain in the dairy business. We have lowered our cost per unit by the economy of scale, but we have produced more. It is time to rethink this old reliable method of increasing our profit.</p>
        <p>We need to take a long hard look at our input. Perhaps we can increase the farmer's profit by not using as much fertilizer and/or pesticides thereby maximizing profitable production per bushel of grain or bushel of apples.</p>
        <p>Apple growers in the Northeast are involved in an interesting program that has reduced the use of pesticides. Instead of using pesticides as a preventive measure, with the aid of the Cooperative Extension Service they have first identified whether there was a need, using field traps and visual observation, and have applied pesticides only when insects were so numerous as to require control.</p>
        <p>In this way two major objectives were accomplished: reduction of costs and use of less chemicals.</p>
        <p>This is just one example of decreasing the cost of input and increasing profitability. We have long done this with labor on our farms. We need to do this with fertilizer and pesticides and other methodology.</p>
        <p>The Extension Service has served as a vital link through which knowledge is dispersed from the experiment stations to the agricultural community. Known worldwide as a leader in agricultural advancements, Connecticut's Experimental Stations, particularly the one in New Haven, have originated such tremendous achievements as hybrid corn and much of the technology of the so-called ''green revolution.'' (Incidentally, this simultaneous development of new varieties of crops and improved agricultural techniques to increase crop yields has changed India from a deficit food-producing nation into a country that produces surpluses).</p>
        <p>The Extension Service is needed now more than ever to show farmers how they can increase their profit per Blurb Goes Here bushel and per pound of milk without producing more bushels and more pounds of milk. We need research in our experiment stations to determine how we can best accomplish these goals. Then we need to alert the farmers to these methods. We need to change our awards from the highest production per acre of field corn, for instance, to the most economical or the lowest cost per ton of corn silage.</p>
        <p>Several years ago I attended a conference on food and social policy in Iowa. The pessimists told us that the world had only a six-month supply of food and that with the increase in population, more people would face starvation. However, the optimists, who happened to be the technocrats, stated we had more than an adequate food supply. Fortunately, the optimists have proven to be better forecasters.</p>
        <p>We have exported our technology to the rest of the world. Most countries of the world now have surpluses. The shortage areas, while dramatic, comprise less than 3 percent of the total. As we exported our technology, we also exported some of our agricultural policies, which include subsidies.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many countries have expanded on our system of subsidies. Japan, for example, subsidizes rice to 10 times the world market price; it is questionable whether rice can be economically grown there any more. The European Common Market also heavily subsidizes agriculture to the extent that American agriculture has been priced out of many world markets.</p>
        <p>Trade negotiations that are currently taking place will, I hope, be beneficial to the problems of exporting American agricultural products. The lower dollar should also help.  Economists suggest that we should have quota systems and cut back on American agriculture production, but every time we have done that, production somewhere else in the world has expanded, and we have lost our ability to produce. I believe that our agricultural products can be competitive in all markets of the world if we stop trying to produce more and instead concentrate on lower costs, thereby making us more competitive.</p>
        <p>As we head into the late 80's and the 90's, I believe we must strive to continue to strengthen our agriculture in this country by phasing out agricultural welfare.</p>
        <p>Farming operations in the entire country have come upon hard times. Some naysayers have even said that farming in the Northeast was doomed. I disagree.</p>
        <p>While farms in New England, and in Connecticut in particular, are smaller than those in the Middle West and West, we have tremendous water resources, both in terms of rainfall and in replenished aquifers. In most of the West, especially in California, New Mexico, Texas, and even Kansas, Prehistoric water supplies have been tapped. These sources are not being replenished. New England water resources are being replenished, however, a fact that should encourage retention of a strong agricultural system, especially dairying, vegetable growing and production of other commodities.</p>
        <p>In summary, we need a major shift in emphasis in agriculture to lower the cost per unit. We must take a hard look at our input. We must utilize our assets to their utmost, limit our use of expensive pesticides and fertilizer, and once again become a strong competitor in world markets.</p>
        <p>To accomplish these goals in Connecticut, we need a strong and viable agricultural Extension Service. We also need to make the most of our experiment stations, which have been funded by contributions, grants from industry and by our tax dollars.</p>
