        <p>LEAD: The people of Vietnam will vote Sunday in the first national elections to offer a genuine choice of candidates, according to official newspaper and television reports.</p>
        <p>The people of Vietnam will vote Sunday in the first national elections to offer a genuine choice of candidates, according to official newspaper and television reports.</p>
        <p>Voters will choose 496 deputies to the National Assembly, the third to be elected since the country was unified under Communist rule in 1975. They will also vote for local councils.</p>
        <p>Under new election procedures similar to those being introduced in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, each constituency must have more candidates on the ballot than the seats to be filled.</p>
        <p>Vietnam is a single-party state - the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan called it ''a tool of the socialist collective mastery system'' and a ''proletarian dictatorship'' - and all candidates are required to accept the Communist ideology.</p>
        <p>''The election must be carried out in a truly democratic manner,'' the newspaper said. ''Voters should not be driven into a situation where they merely have to cast their votes for a preselected name list.'' Correction of Abuses Ordered</p>
        <p>Local party organizations have been bombarded with directives about conducting self-criticism, correcting political abuses, eliminating high-handed attitudes and listening to the sentiments of local people.</p>
        <p>Exemplary provinces have been praised in the official press - at least one was reported to have introduced secret balloting in candidate selection - while those with poor performance have been castigated.</p>
        <p>On March 23, according to a domestic radio broadcast monitored and translated by the BBC, a team of Hanoi assemblymen ''in a serious mood'' reviewed their performance and found flaws. The team ''was slow in solving complaints and denunciations from constituents'' and contributed little ''to the building of various social-economic projects in the capital,'' the radio said.</p>
        <p>In the election Sunday, the Hanoi candidate list will be led by Nguyen Van Linh, who became General Secretary of the Communist Party in December. Assembly Will Meet in June</p>
        <p>Constituencies throughout the country have been directed to send into retirement members who are too old or ill to function effectively and to look for replacements who ''set good examples in their life style.''</p>
        <p>The new assembly will not meet until June. Its first session is expected to coincide with the completion of changes at the top levels of the Government, according to Vietnamese officials and Hanoi-based diplomats.</p>
