        <p>LEAD: Despite protests over the United States decision to impose tariffs on some Japanese electronic products, there is little fear here that the tariffs will touch off a trade war or fundamentally harm the close relations between the two nations.</p>
        <p>Despite protests over the United States decision to impose tariffs on some Japanese electronic products, there is little fear here that the tariffs will touch off a trade war or fundamentally harm the close relations between the two nations.</p>
        <p>Instead, the American action has raised questions about Japanese trading practices and whether a hard-line trade policy works or could backfire.</p>
        <p>In the wake of President Reagan's imposition of a 100 percent tariff on some Japanese-made computers, television sets and power tools on Friday, newspapers editorials and trade experts have called on Japanese companies to re-examine policies that anger their trading partners. And Government officials, although repeating their belief that the tariffs were unjustified and a violation of trade rules, stressed the importance of the overall United States-Japan relationship.</p>
        <p>''I do not think this is a trade war,'' said Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Hajime Tamura.</p>
        <p>''Basically,'' he said, ''America and Japan are the most friendly nations'' in the world. He and other top officials, including Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, pledged to work for swift repeal of the tariffs. Repeal of Tariffs Expected</p>
        <p>Indeed, one reason for the lack of polemics appears to be Japanese confidence that the tariffs will not remain in effect long. Officials say they will soon have statistical proof that they are complying with the semiconductor agreement at the heart of the trade dispute. The United States has charged that Japan has failed to stop selling semiconductors at low prices in overseas markets and has failed to open its markets to American-made chips.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tamura told reporters today that Japan had decided against retaliating immediately because he hopes that his meetings next week with the United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, can lead to an early settlement of the dispute. Japanese officials are also working on a separate package of trade measures that Mr. Nakasone will bring with him when he visits Washington on April 29.</p>
        <p>To many Japanese, indeed, the tariffs are symbolic. Although Japanese manufacturers registered strong protests today, and although it is clear that the tariffs will hurt exports of specific products, it is unlikely that $300 million worth of tariffs will deal much of a blow to an industry that exported, by Japanese statistics, $21 billion of products to the United States last year.</p>
        <p>Moreover, despite rumblings from Congress about further trade legislation, it appears that many Japanese do not think the United States would be able to shut Japan completely out of the American market. U.S. Said to Need the Trade</p>
        <p>''I think there is some feeling on the part of Japanese that the Americans will no longer be able to do without money or products from Japan,'' said Masahiko Ishizuka, editor of the English-language edition of The Japan Economic Journal. ''This feeling might prove wrong, but it leads to an expectation that the United States will stop somewhere in avoiding a total trade war.''</p>
        <p>In some quarters, however, the American action has prompted calls for a re-examination of Japanese corporate behavior and trade practices. Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper that often reflects the thinking of the Nakasone administration, said in an editorial this morning: ''The root of the problem is within Japanese corporations, which drive themselves into excessive competition and into obtaining market shares even at the expense of profits. If this situation goes unchanged, Japan is bound to encounter one trade dispute after another with the U.S. and other countries.''</p>
        <p>A managing director of McKinsey &amp; Company who often writes on trade issues, Kenichi Ohmae, said that although American companies needed to try harder in the Japanese market, Japanese corporate practices were also at fault. In particular, he pointed to the fierce competition between Japanese companies that causes each company to rush to match investments made by its competitors. The result, in cars, shipbuilding and now semiconductors, has been overcapacity, falling prices and trade tensions. 'We Can Be a Menace'</p>
        <p>''It's a kamikaze mentality - if you fail when others fail, it is not considered a shame,'' he said. ''We have to come to grips with this, otherwise we will continue to produce tragedies. We have to realize that we can be a menace to the rest of the world, without any intention on Japan's part to do so.''</p>
        <p>Government officials often say that American pressure can help to persuade vested interests in Japan to give in. And, with reservations, some Japanese said a tough American policy might prove effective.</p>
        <p>''To some extent this tactic works,'' Mr. Ishizuka said, adding, ''What's lacking in Japanese policy is to take action before being forced to do so.''</p>
        <p>An endless round of trade sanctions or particularly vituperative criticism from Congress could hurt Japanese pride, Government officials said.</p>
        <p>''If you're slapped on your face,'' a senior Government official said, ''would you be willing to offer your other cheek to be slapped?''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Ishizuka said he thought pragmatism would prevail. ''In the back of their minds, anti-American feeling might be brewing,'' he said. ''But Japanese are very well aware that without the American market, Japan's economy will be in serious trouble.''</p>
