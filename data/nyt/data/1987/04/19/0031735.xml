        <p>LEAD: FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.</p>
        <p>FROM REMOVING FIG LEAVES on Italian masterpieces to censoring films in Hong Kong to protecting antiquities in Israel, culture the world over provokes heated debate.</p>
        <p>Following is a roundup of reports from 12 Times foreign correspondents about cultural issues that have sparked controversy and discussion in their countries. In addition to reflecting the inextricable connections among art, money and politics, their reports show that countries throughout the world are struggling to maintain their cultural heritage and that television - its control, programming and funding - is an increasingly important concern.</p>
        <p>Wherever Canadian artists, writers and performers gather there is the tinder for a heated discussion about the Canada Council, the body created 30 years ago last month to foster the country's creative talents.</p>
        <p>Functioning much like Britain's Arts Council, the organization dispenses Government funds - the equivalent of about $75 million in United States dollars for 1987-88 - in support of everything from children's theater to publishing houses. In a country where private donations make up a much smaller percentage of the overall budgets of most major cultural institutions than in the United States, it is much-needed money - and traditionally, much squabbled over.</p>
        <p>The council has survived the public contretemps that have swirled around it over some of its less well-advised grants.</p>
        <p>There was the occasion when a young performer used council funds to travel around the country smashing pianos (in ''concert,'' or so the performer claimed) for the sake of art. Then there was the writer who allegedly used part of his council money to buy false teeth. The council official who tells that story does so more in sympathy than regret, judging that the lack of reliable dentures could well have been the difference between a good work and a bad one.</p>
        <p>The main debate is about the council's general pattern of subsidies. The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, stirred a hornet's nest recently by suggesting that the body has become a private club for cultural fat cats, to the detriment of young, impoverished talents with greater need for the money. According to the newspaper, one result has been complaints that the council has been ''writing checks to well-paid celebrities while rejecting thousands of applications from struggling artists who actually know what the inside of a cold-water flat looks like.''</p>
        <p>But paying well-heeled writers such as Margaret Atwood or Mordecai Richler as much as $20,000 to complete books in progress may be a less cogent argument against the council's funding patterns than the case made by the Ottawa writer John Metcalf, a former recipient who has sworn off future subsidies. He claims the appointment of established writers to the juries making the awards - some of them petitioners for grants themselves - has created a ''servile literary climate'' in which writers are loath to criticize each other.</p>
        <p>''We now have about 25 top writers in Canada, but how many millions of dollars did we have to spend to achieve that?'' Mr. Metcalf asks. ''Would they not have written without the money?''  OF FIG LEAVES, ART AND OTHER DISPUTES</p>
