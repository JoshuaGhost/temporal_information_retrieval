        <p>SHIFTING GEARS  Technology, Literature, Culture in Modernist America. By Cecelia Tichi. Illustrated. 310 pp. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press. Cloth, $35. Paper, $14.95.  A SPEAKER at the elaborate ceremonies marking the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge on May 24, 1883, hailed the span as a great victory in the ''never ending struggle . . . to subdue the forces of nature to  [ human ]  control and use.'' But it was a special victory, a triumph of the machine and engineering technology that gave the United States much of its physical and cultural shape at the turn of the century. And the bridge immediately became the symbol of the era Hugh Kenner, in ''The Mechanic Muse,'' describes as ''the golden age of ironware, when every thinkable human activity save perhaps the reproductive was being mapped onto machinery.''</p>
        <p>''Shifting Gears'' is an ambitious effort to articulate this mapping in relation to the literature of the time. Cecelia Tichi, a professor of English at Boston University, ends her book with a meditation on the skyscraper, but the world of the Brooklyn Bridge remains her central concern. This is the world of the great mechanical inventions, the technology of component parts, immense metal structures, boilers, gear wheels, ball bearings, pistons and locomotives, as well as steel mills, electricity, automobiles and household appliances.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tichi traces the connections between this gear-and-girder world and American journalism, popular fiction and imaginative literature from the 1880's to the middle of the 20th century. The idea is not radically new, but it has not been presented in such detail before, and Ms. Tichi is a keen observer of details and visual parallels. Her book is full of intriguing information and evocative illustrations. It does not, however, answer all the theoretical questions it raises.</p>
        <p>The structures and machines of the late 19th century drastically altered the everyday life of most Americans, and had a correspondingly remarkable effect on their imagination. Technological metaphors became rampant in journalism. Breakfast foods were advertised as ''Fine Food for Young Engines.'' Good Housekeeping magazine described the house as ''a factory for the production of happiness'' and published a booklet entitled ''Household Engineering.'' The Ladies' Home Journal, implying that a ''no'' answer was cause for shame, asked its readers, ''Are you a household engineer?''</p>
        <p>But the appeal of engineering extended well beyond journalism. Ms. Tichi offers a fascinating account of the national obsession with eliminating instability and waste through technology. Her account of the emergence of these themes in popular literature is equally engrossing, and convincing.</p>
        <p>Edward Bellamy's ''Looking Backward: 2000-1887'' (1888) foresaw a Boston made perfect by technological innovation. Bellamy's novel, Ms. Tichi writes, is the real precursor of Frederick Winslow Taylor, whose Efficiency Movement in the 1910's promised incredible increases in human productivity through the elimination of useless motions. In turn, Taylorism both reflected and engendered new literary trends.</p>
        <p>In popular literature, a new cultural hero emerged - the engineer. In hundreds of films and novels, the engineer (white, male and by birth, demeanor or education belonging to the upper class) invariably introduced design and morality - civilization - into formerly unreclaimed lands.</p>
        <p>In serious literature, matters were more complicated. Some authors saw in technology a danger to art and morality. The central character of Willa Cather's ''Alexander's Bridge,'' a stereotypical engineer, finally drowns when his shoddily constructed bridge collapses in a deeply symbolic, but transparent, catastrophe. By contrast, in Sherwood Anderson's ''Poor White'' the hero survives, but only because he abandons engineering and turns to a nostalgically evoked, but vague, earlier and simpler America. MS. TICHI has no sympathy for Anderson.</p>
        <p>She prefers authors who found in technology new means of expression. She believes that words, the materials of literature, require as much ''artful, functional integration'' as the component parts of machines. But Anderson would not acknowledge the parallel between works of art and technological structures: ''To see the poet in the engineer would also have meant seeing the engineer in the poet,'' Ms. Tichi writes. ''Anderson would then have to acknowledge his role as a constructor of fiction. He could no longer define himself as a singer of poetic story-songs, but as a designer of fictional forms.'' But that is precisely the parallel Dos Passos, Hemingway and William Carlos Williams accepted and glorified. Their modernism consists in their having seen themselves as designers and constructors of fiction.</p>
        <p>Here we reach the most original, and most debatable, part of Ms. Tichi's view. By applying the principles of machine efficiency in constructing their works, these authors, Ms. Tichi writes, showed that literary works are ''assemblies of component parts, including prefabricated parts.'' Anderson's spontaneous ''story-songs'' seem far behind. But are they?</p>
        <p>We can indeed construe the headlines, advertisements and conversational snatches Dos Passos Continued on next page and Williams incorporated into their work as ''prefabricated parts.'' Ms. Tichi, however, claims that Dos Passos wanted ''to write fiction from an omniscient point of view in an age that no longer believed in an omniscient God-like presence'' and that he found in the engineer the omniscient ''designer with whom the writer could identify.'' But the omniscient narrator has always been a device for presenting the novel as a faithful transcription of an independent reality and precisely not as a self-conscious ''design of functional forms.'' Joyce achieved such self-consciousness by eliminating the narrative voice. In this context, Dos Passos' reliance on the omniscient engineer begins to look more like a rear-guard skirmish than an avant-garde foray.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tichi writes that Dos Passos, Hemingway and Williams found new imaginative possibilities in engineering technology without making it their subject: ''their works are not about machines. Their poetry and fiction, instead, is the machine.'' But is it?</p>
        <p>Literary modernism, according to Ms. Tichi, depends on efficient streamlining and machine precision. We find these traits in Dos Passos' integration of various semi-independent substructures, in Hemingway's laconic, declarative, unornamented sentences, and in Williams's concise, compressed and terse poems. Every element has a function and therefore works like a component part. And what consists of component parts, as bridges consist of girders and engines of pistons, is a machine or a mechanical structure. YET not everything that is defined by its function is a component part. The parts of living organisms have also been conceived in such terms. ''Shifting Gears'' never convinces us that Williams's famous juxtaposition of ''trees, animals, engines'' means that living things are machines and not that machines are living things. The difference is important. Pound's Vorticist Manifesto of 1914 gives primacy to the machine. But behind the earlier Imagist rule - ''to use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation'' - there lurks an unexpected authority. This is none other than Aristotle, who famously likened the drama to a living thing, of which the plot is the soul, and demanded that the parts of the story be ''so closely connected that transposing or eliminating any one of them will alter and dislocate the whole. For that which makes no perceptible difference by its presence or absence is not a real part of the whole.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean Williams was wrong when he described poems as ''machines made of words,'' or that Ms. Tichi is wrong when she claims that a knowledge of technology is crucial for understanding modernist literature? Not at all. It shows that though different objects (machines, say, or living things) count as examples of perfect design in different historical periods, what constitutes perfect design (functional integration) may remain remarkably unchanged from one period to another. ''Shifting Gears'' demonstrates that technology shaped much modernist American literature. It also inadvertently reveals that the importance of technology springs from deeper values and not from the nature of the machines themselves.</p>
