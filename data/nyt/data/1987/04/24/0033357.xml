        <p>LEAD: Mike Tyson's first major product endorsement will be for Eastman Kodak.</p>
        <p>Mike Tyson's first major product endorsement will be for Eastman Kodak.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Tyson spent seven hours acting in a commercial for Kodacolor film at the gym in which he trains in Catskill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The commercial - part of a purported six-figure deal with Kodak -is said to revolve around Tyson's relationship with the late Cus D'Amato, the man who became the fighter's legal guardian while educating him as a boxer and a human being. The commercial is described as warm-hearted and is expected to be shown in June.</p>
        <p>Tyson, who at age 14 was paroled to D'Amato from a juvenile detention facility in upstate New York, did a commercial earlier for a bank that appeared on television in the Maryland-Washington-Virginia area.</p>
        <p>Jay Rosenstein of the Ohlmeyer Communications Company, which represents Tyson in matters other than boxing, says he thinks Tyson ''can transcend boxing and do for his sport what Arnold Palmer did for golf - that is, broaden the audience.''</p>
        <p>Rosenstein is looking for other major endorsements for Tyson. But because the World Boxing Council- World Boxing Association heavyweight champion has a busy fight calendar ahead of him, Rosenstein is not rushing things.</p>
        <p>Tyson will fight Pinklon Thomas in a championship bout on May 30 in Las Vegas, Nev. In July or August he is expected to box either Tony Tucker or James (Buster) Douglas , who will be opponents for the International Boxing Federation heavyweight title as part of the Tyson-Thomas card.</p>
        <p>In September, Tyson expects to box Tyrell Biggs and, assuming he wins, he expects to fight about every other month.</p>
        <p>A major deal close at hand would have Tyson box in the new Korakuen Airdome in Tokyo next March 21. The deal is reported to be worth $10 million to Tyson in Japanese television and site fees.</p>
        <p>Bill Cayton, co-manager with Jim Jacobs of Tyson, declined to comment on the figure but said, ''For Mike Tyson to go to Japan, he would have to be paid infinitely more.'' Leonard Still Winner</p>
        <p>The final tally on the Home Box Office viewer phone-in vote for the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Sugar Ray Leonard bout is in.</p>
        <p>Of those who voted by calling numbers flashed across HBO screens during several replays of the bout, 91,974 (51.1 percent) viewers thought Leonard was the winner of the fight. There were 87,944 viewers (48.9 percent) who named Hagler the winner.  Bicycles and Boxing</p>
        <p>CBS-TV is planning to televise three bouts in July from towns along the route of the Tour de France bicycle race, which the network is also showing.</p>
        <p>Mort Sharnik, the network's boxing consultant, said that two of the bouts are already penciled in: Duane Thomas vs. Lupe Aquino for Thomas's W.B.C. junior-middleweight title, and Terrence Alli vs. Jose Luis Ramirez for the W.B.C. lightweight title.</p>
        <p>The lightweight title is held by Hector Camacho. But Camacho, a New Yorker who now lives in Clewiston, Fla., has insisted that he has outgrown the 135-pound limit of the division and intends to campaign as a junior welterweight (140-pound limit).  Camacho to Fight Davis</p>
        <p>On May 2, as a a junior welterweight, Camacho will fight a former Olympic gold medalist, Howard Davis, in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>Should Camacho win, there could be a junior-welterweight title fight for him soon against either Terry Marsh (I.B.F. champion) or Patrizio Oliva (W.B.A. champion). But the bout that Camacho says he would really like is a big-money match against Ray (Boom Boom) Mancini, the former W.B.A. lightweight champion who is retired and working in California as an actor.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Camacho said that he and his promoter, Jeff Levine, had talked to Mancini in March about Mancini's coming out of retirement. Mancini confirmed that he has discussed such a fight but said that the sticking point was Camacho's refusal to abstain from fighting other bouts while Mancini began his training regimen.</p>
        <p>Mancini, who last fought Feb. 15, 1985, when he lost a rematch to Livingstone Bramble, is apparently taking his cues from Leonard. On April 6, Leonard came out of retirement and fought Hagler, who had not had a bout for nearly a year.</p>
        <p>''The timing was perfect for Leonard,'' Mancini said. ''And I'd be willing to fight this fight next year if Camacho would be willing to hold off from fighting.''  Rosario Bout Sought</p>
        <p>If the bout can be arranged, HBO would likely put up the television money for Edwin Rosario (the W.B.A. lightweight champion) vs. Julio Cesar Chavez (the W.B.C. superfeatherweight champion). . . . Both Donald Curry, the United States Boxing Association junior-middleweight champion, and Mike McCallum, the W.B.A. junior-middleweight champion, want to fight each other. But the sticking point could be the parity that Curry's business representative, Akbar Muhammad, says his fighter must have. ''McCallum will never agree to parity,'' said Dan Duva, McCallum's promoter. ''He'd have to get the bulk of the money.''</p>
        <p>Buster Drayton, the I.B.F. junior-middleweight champion, is expected to defend his title against Matthew Hilton in Canada June 14. . . . Last Monday in Santa Monica, Calif., Tony Tubbs was knocked down once while gaining a decision over Mike Jameson. It was the first time Tubbs had fought since January 1986, when he lost his W.B.A. heavyweight title to Tim Witherspoon.</p>
