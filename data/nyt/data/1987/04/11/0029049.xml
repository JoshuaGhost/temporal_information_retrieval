        <p>LEAD: Strikers protesting a Government pay plan paralyzed state-run transportation and curtailed the national health service today.</p>
        <p>Strikers protesting a Government pay plan paralyzed state-run transportation and curtailed the national health service today.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders promised more strikes next week in a campaign that began months ago against a Government austerity program that includes a 5 percent ceiling on pay increases for Government workers.</p>
        <p>The Workers Commissions, a Communist-oriented group and Spain's second-largest union, organized the action by transportation workers. Members of the Socialist-led General Workers Union, the largest union, also stayed off the job, union leaders said. About 20 percent of Spain's 10 million workers belong to unions.</p>
        <p>Nationwide 24-hour strikes by employees of the state-run airlines Iberia and Aviaco and the national railway coincided with a walkout by subway workers in Madrid and the third day of strikes by doctors of the national health service, creating huge jams on city streets, in airports and at railroad stations across the country.</p>
        <p>Auto workers and farmers joined the action. About 20,000 workers left their posts at Renault automobile assembly plants in Valladolid, Palencia and Seville. Several thousand farmers in northern Cantabria blocked roads with tractors to protest European Community milk quotas.</p>
        <p>Workers at state-run gasoline stations and a Government-operated hotel chain plan to strike next week.</p>
