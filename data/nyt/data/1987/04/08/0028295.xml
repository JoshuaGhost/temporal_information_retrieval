        <p>LEAD: It's time to talk sense about the Federal deficit, even if the prescription doesn't make us feel good. We need to restrain spending but, equally important, we need to raise taxes if we want to cut the deficit and re-establish a firm foundation for the economy.</p>
        <p>It's time to talk sense about the Federal deficit, even if the prescription doesn't make us feel good. We need to restrain spending but, equally important, we need to raise taxes if we want to cut the deficit and re-establish a firm foundation for the economy.</p>
        <p>It took 39 Presidents and 200 years to accumulate a debt of $1 trillion. But since 1981, the national debt has more than doubled. Interest payments alone have tripled, to a total of $140 billion a year, and are now the third largest segment of our budget, ranking only below Social Security and defense expenditures.</p>
        <p>It's a tragic waste made even more galling by the fact that we increasingly pay this debt to foreign investors in Tokyo, Hamburg, Geneva and Riyadh who have been bailing us out by buying Federal securities.</p>
        <p>Congress's record of fiscal restraint is often overlooked and understated. While spending in general has risen sharply under President Reagan to a record high, Congress has cut domestic programs by $300 billion since 1981 and finally slowed the relentless growth in defense spending in 1986. Many Americans don't know that Congress has reduced the President's budget requests by more than $25 billion over the last six years.</p>
        <p>But the deficits remain. Slower economic growth and huge tax cuts have caused us to outspend our income.</p>
        <p>The President has advocated a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in each of his seven years in office. Yet he has never submitted such a budget and still can't tell us when the books will balance.</p>
        <p>President Reagan has also said he opposes taxes, but his own fiscal 1988 budget calls for $23 billion in new taxes. They are called user fees, asset sales, increased receipts, revenue enhancements and off-setting collections - a crafty use of semantics to make it appear that the President is not contradicting himself.</p>
        <p>The most equitable way to subtaintially reduce the deficit is to delay reductions in the top tax bracket for upper-income taxpayers. But given opposition from the President and key members of Congress to any changes in the new tax code, we are left with Federal excise taxes, a broad-based energy tax, including perhaps an oil import fee, and further closing of tax loopholes. Given these limited options, the resulting nickel and dime approach to the deficit problem falls short.</p>
        <p>New taxes are never going to be popular. Antitax rhetoric has won its share of political campaigns, but these are short-term political victories that ultimately hurt the national economy. They don't deserve to be perpetuated and enshrined in public policy. When told the truth, Americans will rise to the challenge and not pass on the debt to their children.</p>
        <p>Just look to North Dakota, where the President campaigned last fall for a Republican Senator on Mr. Reagan's traditional anti-government, antitax rhetoric. But just two weeks ago, the people of North Dakota, one of the most economically distressed states, plowed through a snow storm to vote themselves a tax increase.</p>
        <p>North Dakotans didn't really want to raise taxes. But they wanted a well-managed government, and they met the need to reduce the state's deficit while insuring sufficient funds to provide a decent education for their children. They believed they were making a sound investment.</p>
        <p>The President must join Congress in facing the fiscal facts so that together we can insure economic security. This year he proposed a number of initiatives, including new scientific research centers, a space station and a nuclear particle accelerator. Many of these merit the consideration of Congress, yet the funds to pay for them are nowhere to be found in the President's budget projections.</p>
        <p>I think we are ready to listen to concrete proposals to arrest illiteracy, to lower infant death rates and increase our international competitiveness. Americans are prepared to make personal sacrifices to achieve these goals.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Ronald Reagan, then Governor, told Californians that his feet were set in concrete on a similar tax issue. Eventually, to bipartisan approval, he announced with his typical good humor: ''I think the sound you hear is the concrete cracking around my feet.'' Our country needs the President to join that spirit of compromise once again.</p>
