        <p>LEAD: A Cornell University fraternity has been ordered closed for four years by administrators, who have accused the group of sexual abuse, house mismanagement and illegal use of alcohol, the university said today.</p>
        <p>A Cornell University fraternity has been ordered closed for four years by administrators, who have accused the group of sexual abuse, house mismanagement and illegal use of alcohol, the university said today.</p>
        <p>Members of the fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, were told last Tuesday of their pending loss of university recognition, which takes effect May 31, a university spokesman, David Stewart, said. The fraternity was given two days to respond to the university's decision, which became final today, he said.</p>
        <p>''They did respond and offered an alternative plan to police themselves, but that alternative fell short of solving the problem and indicated to us that they did not accept the seriousness of the charges,'' Mr. Stewart said. The action is the most severe ever taken against a fraternity at the Ivy League school, he said.</p>
        <p>Telephone calls to the Phi Gamma Delta house were not answered.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a one-month investigation by university officials, the Greek Judicial Board, a panel of students, faculty and alumni. Members of the fraternity, including an alumni advisor and a representative from the national fraternity, appeared at a hearing in April.</p>
