        <p>LEAD: A former administrative judge in the Queens traffic court has testified that he took about $1,000 in bribes to fix at least 20 traffic tickets for motorists in a scheme that also involved police officers and an unlicensed private investigator, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A former administrative judge in the Queens traffic court has testified that he took about $1,000 in bribes to fix at least 20 traffic tickets for motorists in a scheme that also involved police officers and an unlicensed private investigator, law-enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The admission by the former hearing officer for the State Department of Motor Vehicles, Hector Rosado, 35 years old of Queens, came Monday during the internal Police Department trial of one of the officers accused in the scheme, Robert Hanes. The authorities said Mr. Rosado, a lawyer who left the post last fall, had not been charged, in exchange for cooperating with a special prosecutor's investigation of the case.</p>
        <p>Investigators said that Mr. Rosado sometimes took bribes directly from motorists but that he also apparently accepted money from officers. Tickets range from $20 to $1,000.</p>
        <p>The investigation came to light last month when Officer Hanes, 44, of the Queens highway unit, was arrested on charges of perjury and tampering with a witness. Officials said he had persuaded another officer who had issued a speeding ticket to give perjured testimony that enabled the motorist to have it dismissed.</p>
