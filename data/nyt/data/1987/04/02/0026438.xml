        <p>LEAD: The Reagan Administration has selected an executive of a major air freight company as the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, according to his Congressman and company officials.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration has selected an executive of a major air freight company as the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, according to his Congressman and company officials.</p>
        <p>The reported nominee is T. Allan McArtor, a 44-year-old senior vice president of the Federal Express Corporation. If nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. McArtor would lead the aviation agency through what is expected to be one of its most turbulent periods yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor, a former Air Force fighter pilot who was decorated for heroism in Vietnam, would succeed Donald D. Engen, 62, a retired vice admiral of the Navy who announced his resignation last month after repeated frustrations in his dealings with the Administration, the airline industry and Congress. He has led the agency for three years.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor would take over at a time when airline passengers are experiencing widespread delays and cancellations, major airlines are pressing the Government to spend more on airport improvements and air traffic controllers are trying to organize a new union. 'Significant' Issues Seen</p>
        <p>''I am honored to be considered for Administrator of the F.A.A.,'' Mr. McArtor said in a statement released by his Memphis-based company. ''The issues currently before the agency are significant and will affect the airline industry and the traveling public for many years. I look forward to assuming this challenge upon approval of my nomination.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the Department of Transportation, the parent agency of the F.A.A., and the agency itself said they could not confirm the report that Mr. McArtor would be named to the $89,500-a-year post.</p>
        <p>Representative Don Sundquist, a Tennessee Republican, said Mr. McArtor was chosen for the post after impressing Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, with whom he served on a space travel panel.</p>
        <p>''He's very bright and a good manager,'' Mr. Sundquist said of Mr. McArtor. ''Having been in air transportation most of his life, he's eminently qualified.'' A Member of the Thunderbirds</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor, who was born in St. Louis, was graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1964 and received a Master of Science degree from Arizona State University in 1971. As an Air Force major he received the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in Vietnam. He also served for two years as a member of the Thunderbirds, the Air Force precision flying team.</p>
        <p>Mr. McArtor, who joined Federal Express in 1970, has held executive positions in the company's aviation and advanced technology division. He is senior vice president for telecommunications, responsible for the operations of its domestic and international telecommunications networks.</p>
        <p>If Mr. McArtor becomes the new F.A.A. Administrator, he will take over an agency embroiled in conflict. Mr. Engen was frequently frustrated by his battles with Mrs. Dole and with the Office of Management and Budget, colleagues said. They cited as examples the the Transportation Department's repeated slashing of his proposed budgets for the agency and the the budget office's insistence that the agency use private contractors as air controllers at small airports and allow airlines to buy and sell their landing rights at major airports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engen was also frustrated by flight delays that he said were partly attributable to overbooking by the airlines. Delays and cancellations increased by 25 percent last year, and predictions that the situation would worsen led to a deepening dispute between the Administration and Congress.</p>
        <p>''In the long run, it's going to get worse unless we build more airports, '' he said of the flight delays in an interview last week. Members of Congress have proposed various restrictions and penalties on the airlines but the Administration has indicated that it would rather rely on the marketplace to weed out inefficient practices.</p>
