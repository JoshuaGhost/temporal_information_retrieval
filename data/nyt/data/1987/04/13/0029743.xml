        <p>LEAD: Eight months after contracts were signed, a Koch administration plan to lower concrete prices by subsidizing the construction of a concrete plant in Manhattan is in serious jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Eight months after contracts were signed, a Koch administration plan to lower concrete prices by subsidizing the construction of a concrete plant in Manhattan is in serious jeopardy.</p>
        <p>The plant, scheduled to have been operating by now, has been stalled by lawsuits and investors backing out. It is less than a third complete and, with the prime summer construction season approaching, city officials say they must decide within weeks on a number of key questions.</p>
        <p>Those questions, city officials say, include whether to hold the plant's operator in default, take the plant over for operation by the city or to abandon the project altogether.</p>
        <p>Complicating any city action is the fact that concrete prices on the open market have fallen so much since the contracts were signed in August that they are actually lower than the prices at which the city agreed to purchase concrete from the plant's operator, Mustapha Ally, a 53-year-old native of Guyana who lives in Maryland. Two Lawsuits Pending</p>
        <p>''We have seen concrete prices drop between $8 and $10 a yard since the contract was announced,'' said Barry G. Cox, an assistant to Robert Esnard, the Deputy Mayor for Policy and Economic Development.</p>
        <p>The plant at 57th Street on the Hudson River piers was intended to meet the city's needs for concrete and to provide competition in an industry that Federal and state law-enforcement officials say is rife with price fixing and is closely allied with the Mafia.</p>
        <p>The contract specified that Mr. Ally, in return for free use of city land, would supply concrete for all city projects at a set price about 13 percent below the market rate.</p>
        <p>What has stalled the project, and which now threatens to undo it entirely, are primarily two lawsuits filed in December in Federal and state courts in Manhattan by a group of local concrete producers, city officials say. Investors Back Out</p>
        <p>Because of the suits, several key investors have backed out of the $7.3 million project, apparently discouraged by the legal challenge to what makes the plant an attractive investment: the city's agreement that Mr. Ally could sell on the open market any concrete not used in city projects.</p>
        <p>''The investors have just not come through,'' Mr. Esnard said. He declined to name the investors, saying: ''We don't negotiate this kind of deal in the newspapers. It's inappropriate for us to say.''</p>
        <p>City officials had hoped the plant eventually could produce up to 750,000 cubic yards of concrete each year.</p>
        <p>The concrete producers argue in their lawsuits that the project would violate Federal antitrust law because it would give unfair advantage to a competitor. They also argue that the city violated its own bidding procedures by not adequately checking Mr. Ally's background.</p>
        <p>The concrete producers say Mr. Ally exaggerated his personal finances, including his listing of a large quantity of gold that he said was being held in Guyana, in his application to be the plant operator. They also say he withheld information on a larcency conviction in Maryland in 1979.</p>
        <p>City officials concede that they are having difficulty verifying Mr. Ally's financial holdings. They said it has been especially difficult to determine if Mr. Ally does hold any gold in Guyana because the Guyana Government could sieze the gold if its whereabouts were known. City officials also said they were aware that Mr. Ally had been convicted of larceny for passing a bad check.</p>
        <p>But they were not overly concerned in either case because the city had not assumed a substantial financial risk and had also found it extremely difficult to attract an operator to run the plant However, Mayor Koch yesterday asked City Investigation Commissioner Kenneth Conboy to study allegations that Mr. Ally had submitted forged documents when he applied to the city to build the plant.</p>
        <p>If the documents proved false, that could end the deal, according to Larry Simonberg, a spokesman for the Mayor, Lawyers for Mr. Ally declined to comment on the matter outside of court, and did not return telephone calls to their office in New York City.</p>
        <p>Because the plant has not produced any concrete by this time, the city can cancel its contract with Mr. Ally. City officials, however, are reluctant to do so. They say another operator would have to be found, which could take months, and then the concrete producers could file another lawsuit at a strategic time that would lead to even further delays and the same investor reluctance next year. Industry's Link to Mafia Cited</p>
        <p>Justice Burton Sherman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan is expected to rule in a few weeks on whether to stop the contract. The Federal suit is still in the preliminary stages.</p>
        <p>In response to the charges in the suit, the city contends that the concrete producers have used strong-arm tactics to keep new companies like Mr. Ally's from entering the market.</p>
        <p>In State Supreme Court in Manhattan last Thursday, the city filed an affidavit from an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that described a conversation taped in 1983 between a reputed leader of the Lucchese organized-crime family, Frank Manzo, and a man identified by the F.B.I. as John Quadrozzi, a concrete manufacturer who is also the lead plaintiff in the suits against the city. Mr. Quadrozzi is the president of the Association of New York Concrete Producers.</p>
        <p>In the conversation, according to the affidavit, Mr. Quadrozzi asked Mr. Manzo, who has since been convicted and sentenced to 12 years in Federal prison on racketeering charges, to stop a new concrete company from setting up business in Brooklyn. A 'Publicity Gimmick'</p>
        <p>''Rule No. 1 is, we take care of you, you gotta protect us,'' Mr. Quadrozzi is quoted in the affidavit as saying. ''Rule No. 2, no new plants.''</p>
        <p>''Right, no new plants,'' Mr. Manzo reportedly replied.</p>
        <p>Gerald Walpin, who is representing the concrete producers in state and Federal court, acknowledged that allegations of organized-crime links have been made, but stressed that few have been proven in any court. He said the city has used the allegations unfairly.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful publicity gimmick to mask the reality of this situation,'' Mr. Walpin said, referring to the allegations of Mafia ties. ''The reality is that the city has decided to make responsible concrete companies a scapegoat for the problem of high prices of real estate in New York.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the city say the project was intended, in large part, as an economic development measure to bring down construction costs and thereby lower commercial rents, making it less expensive to do business in the city.</p>
        <p>They say that the mechanics of the project, primarily the subsidy of city land, are allowed under the city's charter and the state laws that govern economic development projects. They also say that the project, in part, contributed to the recent decline in concrete prices by forcing producers to anticipate the new competition.</p>
