        <p>Between innings, the fans are entertained by taped highlights from last season, played to the tune of ''We Are the Champions.'' Bill Buckner still cannot pick up Mookie Wilson's grounder and Jesse Orosco's glove has yet to come down after his celebratory toss following the final out of the World Series.</p>
        <p>Memories are nice - they account for the popularity of photo albums -but there was nothing like yesterday's good old-fashioned whipping by the Atlanta Braves to remind the Mets and their fans that this is another season and there are no guarantees of repeating last year's success.</p>
        <p>Bob Ojeda noted that although losing is inevitable, it would be best if the Mets did not get into a habit of treating defeat too casually, even in the first week of the season.</p>
        <p>''It's just one game but I think now the first one in Philadelphia will be important,'' he said. ''We want to turn it around.''</p>
        <p>The Braves routed the Mets, 12-4, yesterday, as Dale Murphy drove in five runs with his first two home runs of the season, one of them during a seven-run seventh inning against Randy Myers and Doug Sisk. The Mets pitchers haven't been treated so rudely since the Phillies scored nine runs in the first inning of a 26-7 victory, June 11, 1985, in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>At this point in a season, a good start or poor start can be redefined within a matter of 48 hours. The Mets won their first three games, largely because of the home run exploits of Darryl Strawberry and Kevin McReynolds. The team is still hitting baseballs over fences, Len Dykstra and Gary Carter adding to the total yesterday, giving the Mets nine in five games.</p>
        <p>But when the applause dies down and the curtain calls are completed, there are some statistics that show the Mets aren't hitting as well as it might appear. They have scored 20 runs, 16 accounted for by home runs. They left 12 runners on base against the Braves yesterday, seven in the first three innings when the game was close.</p>
        <p>Keith Hernandez is batting .200 and looking for his first run batted in. Rafael Santana increased his hitless streak to 16 times at bat before getting a broken-bat single in the eighth inning. ''I'm a new man,'' he said. ''Now, I've got 1 in 87.'' Bird Is Killed</p>
        <p>The Mets preferred to think their second consecutive loss to the Braves was fated. Strawberry dropped a fly ball in the second inning, allowing a run to score. That won't happen often. In the third, a routine fly ball hit to left field by Dion James struck and killed a dove in flight. That will happen even less frequently. In fact, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time it occurred in major league history.</p>
        <p>James was on second base with a double before McReynolds could retrieve the ball. ''I didn't know what was happening,'' James said. McReynolds first thought he had lost the ball in the sun.</p>
        <p>An envious Santana, said, ''I wish I had that kind of luck.''</p>
        <p>Ojeda knew an omen when he saw one. He retired the next two hitters and should have been on his way to the dugout when Murphy came up to bat. The Braves' slugger has been hitting well, but not for power during the opening week. He said he concentrated on extending his arms more during batting practice, and the extra work paid off.</p>
        <p>He hit a pitch out of the strike zone over the right-field fence, putting the Braves ahead, 4-1. ''I don't feel any pressure to hit home runs,'' he said. ''I don't sit down and worry about it. I'm a free swinger, and if a home run happens, it happens.'' Braves Hitting Well</p>
        <p>The Braves have won four of their five games, largely because they have a .316 team batting average. Because Bob Horner could not reach agreement on a new contract and is considering an offer to play in Japan this year, Murphy is the only consistent home run threat in the lineup.</p>
        <p>He said he has tried not to be influenced by that. ''Bob's a good friend and the reality will set in that he may not be here,'' Murphy said. ''But we've been without him for a while and we've got to carry on.''</p>
        <p>The Braves may not be as imposing as the Mets but they capitalized on opportunities during the weekend series. The Mets, Howard Johnson observed, have hit most of their home runs with no one on base.</p>
        <p>Dykstra led off the first inning with his second homer, but McReynolds eventually grounded out with two runners on to end the inning. In the second inning, Hernandez flied to left with the bases loaded and two out. In the next inning, Santana struck out with two runners on.</p>
        <p>Carter's two-run homer in the seventh was simply too little, too late. ''But after that bird got hit,'' Wally Backman said, ''you knew the roof would cave in.''</p>
