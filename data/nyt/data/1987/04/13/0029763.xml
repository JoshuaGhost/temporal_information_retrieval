        <p>LEAD: The American Embassy in Moscow is an island under constant assault. Laser beams probe the windows for echoes of conversations. Tunnels have been bored below, and antennas thrust up its chimneys. Cocktail bars and swimming pools are alive with ''swallows,'' seductive women who lure the susceptible into ''honey traps.</p>
        <p>The American Embassy in Moscow is an island under constant assault. Laser beams probe the windows for echoes of conversations. Tunnels have been bored below, and antennas thrust up its chimneys. Cocktail bars and swimming pools are alive with ''swallows,'' seductive women who lure the susceptible into ''honey traps.'' Rooms, cars, even typewriters are likely to be bugged. Except in special secure chambers, diplomats assume that all conversations are overheard. In this strange world, several Marine guards fell prey to the swallows, apparently giving the Russians the run of the embassy and themselves a new motto - saepe fidelis, often faithful.</p>
        <p>This island has a counterpart, also in an alien sea. The new Soviet Embassy stands on Mount Alto in residential Washington. From this prominence, Soviet antennas pluck stray radiation from microwave towers, eavesdropping on a babel of telephone conversations. Laser beams have line-of-sight view to the windowpanes of the White House and the Capitol. During construction, Soviet officials inspected each concrete pour and X-rayed each block. Construction of the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow was not so carefully monitored by Americans.</p>
        <p>Now that the problems with the two embassies have erupted into public view, the spy business once again threatens to impede more serious affairs of state. The Senate asked Secretary of State Shultz to call off his trip to Moscow that begins today. Some members of Congress suggest tearing down the new Moscow embassy, others the new Soviet Embassy on Mount Alto. Outrage abounds at Soviet perfidy. There's blame enough to go around, but the outrage is misdirected.</p>
        <p>Though it's prudent to assume the worst of the marines' dereliction in letting Soviet agents roam the Moscow embassy, the worst has not yet been proved. Indeed, the hysteria flows freely even though most of the facts are either not known or yet announced.</p>
        <p>Some agents in Moscow have recently been betrayed, at least one through the defection of Edward Lee Howard, a trainee of the C.I.A., which failed to detect his instability early enough or prevent his flight. The agency would no doubt like to share blame for the damage to its Moscow station with the State Department, which evidently failed to consider that the Russians might think of subverting two marines sharing the same watch.</p>
        <p>Each agency failed to pay attention to detail or to take seriously the K.G.B.'s resourcefulness. Both sides bug embassies and develop agents; the cause for outrage is that the American side seems to have been badly outsmarted. As for the two new embassies in Moscow and Washington, neither yet fully occupied, the sites were agreed on in the early 1960's before the development of modern eavesdropping techniques. The United States turned down a magnificent vantage point on the Lenin Hills as too far from the center of Moscow. The Russians resisted Mount Alto, preferring a site in suburban Chevy Chase.</p>
        <p>If the new Moscow embassy needs to be torn down, the fault is on the American side for not better supervising construction. If there's little pretext for demanding the Mount Alto embassy be dismantled, the Administration had better have the land around it zoned for high-rises. By taking the spy business more seriously, it could avoid the messy scandals that damage security.</p>
        <p>Meantime, the Administration does right to take its lumps and go forward with Secretary of State Shultz's trip to Moscow. Its fault lies in failing to stanch the hemorrhage of real secrets, as in the Walker and Howard cases. In trying to keep too many secrets, it has failed to guard the most essential secrets of all, communications and intelligence.</p>
