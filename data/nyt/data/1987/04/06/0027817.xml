        <p>LEAD: Kim Chong Jung, a solemn 28-year-old, has been a full-time rebel since the day in 1980 when he picked up an M-1 rifle and effectively declared war on the Government.</p>
        <p>Kim Chong Jung, a solemn 28-year-old, has been a full-time rebel since the day in 1980 when he picked up an M-1 rifle and effectively declared war on the Government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim was lucky on that day during the Kwangju uprising. He was on the outskirts of the city, where there was no fighting, and so he survived. Scores of other young people who demanded democracy, numbering perhaps in the hundreds or thousands, were not so fortunate. They were killed as soldiers quelled the insurrection.</p>
        <p>''The Kwangju incident was the driving force to bring me into this political world,'' said Mr. Kim. He has since devoted his life to achieving democracy for his country, by almost any means necessary.</p>
        <p>He is an example of the angry young men whom the Government calls Communists and who appear to pose a growing threat to the South Korean Government. Mr. Kim reflects the common aspirations and outlook of a key sector of the society, one that is growing in bitterness, in militancy and apparently in influence. Veteran of an Uprising</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim, the son of a carpenter, grew up in Kwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul, and in a nearby village. A Roman Catholic who was baptized with the name Francisco, he became active in a Catholic farmers' group that was heavily involved in politics. He became secretary general of the group's Kwangju unit and took part in the uprising in May 1980, in which citizens seized the city after firece clashes with paratroopers and police units. Armed with weapons taken from Government depots, the rebels held the city for eight days before being crushed by fresh Government troops.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim helped organize demonstrations in late 1980 to protest the killings in Kwangju. When the police sought him, he went underground.</p>
        <p>He fled to Seoul, where he stayed for several months with friends. They produced leftist pamphlets and distributed them until the police raided the house on May 14, 1981, and arrested the occupants.</p>
        <p>''I was beaten all night,'' said the thin, bespectacled Mr. Kim. ''My head was dunked in water while I was handcuffed, and I was beaten on the knees until the club broke. Even today, my knees still hurt sometimes. Then I was given the roast-chicken torture, where I was trussed up and suspended in the air. In this position I was beaten and my head was dunked in water.'' Tortured Continued for a Week</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim said the torture continued for a week while the police quizzed him about his ideology and his friends. For three days he was not allowed to sleep, he said, and for three months he was held incommunicado.</p>
        <p>He was sentenced to four years in prison, although he was released after two and a half.</p>
        <p>''I tried to get a factory job, but my application was always rejected,'' he said. So Mr. Kim, living at home and supported by family and friends, worked full time as an organizer for the Catholic farmers' organization and a Kwangju youth group. Last May he was arrested again, but he said he was not tortured and was released after three months in prison.</p>
        <p>Like many young Korean leftists, Mr. Kim says he believes fervently in the unification of North and South Korea, but he is unspecific about how this could be achieved. He is more specific about who is to blame for the continued separation: the South Korean Government and the United States Government. He accuses both governments of obstructing democracy because they know that most people favor unification.</p>
        <p>''There is a bright and dark side to U.S. involvement in Korea,'' Mr. Kim said, ''but since 1945 the dark side is overwhelming.''</p>
