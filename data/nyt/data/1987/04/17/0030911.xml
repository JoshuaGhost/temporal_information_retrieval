        <p>LEAD: As high school seniors braced for word from college admissions offices this week, many college officials reported record numbers of applications this year despite a continuing decline in the number of 18-year-olds.</p>
        <p>As high school seniors braced for word from college admissions offices this week, many college officials reported record numbers of applications this year despite a continuing decline in the number of 18-year-olds.</p>
        <p>It is too soon to know whether the increase in applications was due to a rise in applicants or, as officials suspect, an increase in the number of applications filed by individual students. Whatever the reason, many colleges have the longest waiting lists in their history.</p>
        <p>In addition, many of the more selective colleges are reporting that the quality of their applicant pool - in terms of scores on Scholastic Aptitude Tests, grades and extra-curricular activities - is higher than ever. They say they are rejecting students who would have easily been admitted a few years ago.</p>
        <p>''The kids in the application pool are off the charts,'' said Richard Steele, director of undergraduate admissions at Duke University, where applications were up 19 percent from last year. ''This is the toughest competition we have ever seen. We have a hard time saying no to some of these kids.'' Valedictorians Turned Down</p>
        <p>The dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, Willis J. Stetson Jr., said, ''Maybe 150 or 200 valedictorians have been turned away.''</p>
        <p>Admissions directors said they did not know whether there is a link between the increase in applications and the quality of the applicant pool this year.</p>
        <p>Carol Gill, an educational consultant with offices in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., New York City and Boston, said she knew of students who had applied to 12 and 13 colleges.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone is really sure what's going on,'' she said. ''The whole process has just been hyped up by the colleges and by the parents and by the students and by a society where name brands matter.''</p>
        <p>A spot check of colleges shows a range of increases in undergraduate applications. These include a 17 percent increase from last year at New York University; 12 percent at Syracuse University; 11 percent at Skidmore College and at Connecticut College; about 10 percent at the State University of New York at Buffalo; 7 percent at the University of Rochester, and 4 percent at Manhattanville College. 'Upgrade Their Aspirations'</p>
        <p>In a sense, college officials acknowledge, they may have been responsible for the increase. Anticipating a decline in applications, many increased their recruiting efforts in recent years.</p>
        <p>''One of the theories that nobody has been able to nail down is that as the eligible cohort of 18-year-olds declines, students may feel that they have a better chance for better institutions and upgrade their aspirations,'' said Robert C. Seaver, vice president for communications at the College Board, a nonprofit group that provides tests and other education services.</p>
        <p>''That leads to the hypothesis that kids are filing more applications because they are adding schools that are 'reaches' for them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another theory is that as the cost of education rises, students are applying to more colleges to see where they can get the best financial-aid package.</p>
        <p>Katharine Hanson, executive director of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, a group of 30 selective colleges, said a student who might have applied to three colleges four years ago might now typically apply to four to seven colleges. Decrease at Brown</p>
        <p>One unanswered question is whether the increase in applications at some colleges means a corresponding decrease in others. The answer will not be known until this summer when the admissions process is completed and all the data compiled.</p>
        <p>Ivy League colleges showed markedly smaller increases in the number of applications than many other colleges, according to their admissions offices. Columbia reported a 4 percent rise, while Princeton, Cornell and Penn said they were running about the same as last year. Brown is down 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Some of the large public institutions, such as the University of Vermont and the University of Michigan, reported significant increases, particularly in applications from out-of-state students.</p>
        <p>Vermont, for example, had 12,000 applications, representing an increase of 18 percent, including a gain of 20 percent in out-of-state applications. Applications to Michigan were up 13 percent.</p>
        <p>Many colleges reported a record number of applications. Among these were the University of Chicago, Vassar, Duke, Haverford, Bates, Colgate, Carleton, Pomona and Northwestern. And Wabash College, a small school in Crawfordsville, Ind., and one of the few remaining all-male colleges, had a 75 percent increase over last year, with a record 789 applications. 'Year of the Waiting List'</p>
        <p>This is already being called ''the year of the waiting list.'' If a student applied to seven colleges, for instance, and was accepted by all, he will choose one and free six places. If this is a pattern, colleges may have to turn increasingly to their waiting lists.</p>
        <p>Vermont has more than 2,000 students on its waiting list. Skidmore, which received 4,700 applications for 625 places in the freshman class, has a waiting list of 900.</p>
        <p>''Kids are filing an enormous number of applications, often as many as 12 to 15,'' said Fred Neuberger, dean of admissions at Middlebury (Vt.) College. ''If you're a good student and you apply to 10 schools, you're probably bumping eight kids down onto waiting lists.''</p>
        <p>For years, educators had been predicting a lean period for admissions, based on the drop in the number of 18-year-olds. In 1979, according to census figures, the number of 18-year-olds peaked at 4,316,000. It then dropped every year, bottoming out in 1986 at 3,512,000, according to demographers.</p>
        <p>For the next few years, census projections show an up-and-down pattern for the number of 18-year-olds - up to 3,772,000 in 1988 and down to 3,149,000 in 1992. Trends Evident</p>
        <p>For the first part of this decade, some trends have become evident. The colleges that received the most marked increase in applications, according to figures compiled by the College Board, have been four-year private, liberal arts colleges. In those institutions, applications rose from an average of 1,356 in 1980 to 1,488 in 1985, a 9.7 percent increase.</p>
        <p>In general, applications to four-year institutions - colleges and universities, both public and private - increased 4 percent from 1980 to 1985, according to the College Board.</p>
        <p>The increase in applications from 1980 to 1985 was 8.9 percent at private universities and 5.3 percent at public universities. At the smaller public colleges, with fewer than 1,000 students, there was a 4 percent decrease.</p>
