        <p>LEAD: About 100 years after it disappeared from New York, the lynx, a shy, reclusive cat, will be reintroduced to the state by a team of wildlife scientists, who believe that it is an important component of the wilderness.</p>
        <p>About 100 years after it disappeared from New York, the lynx, a shy, reclusive cat, will be reintroduced to the state by a team of wildlife scientists, who believe that it is an important component of the wilderness.</p>
        <p>''The main reason is esthetic,'' said Dr. Rainer H. Brocke of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse University, who heads the lynx restoration group.</p>
        <p>''In a society and world that is very complex, there is a need more than ever before to have a natural world that inspires us,'' he said. And the lynx, which he considers a symbol of the wilderness, is worth restoring to the wildlife of New York as ''an unusual animal that can inspire us.''</p>
        <p>The lynx project is part of a movement, sponsored by the state government, to go beyond protecting endangered species and bring back some animals that once inhabited wilderness areas of the state. Progams for Eagles and Falcons</p>
        <p>The State Department of Environmental Conservation has two programs in operation, one restoring bald eagles and the other peregrine falcons. In addition, the moose seems to be coming back by itself, wandering in from neighboring states.</p>
        <p>In 11 years, the state has released 166 bald eagles and five pairs are living in New York, with three of them nesting and producing young, according to Peter Nye, head of the state's endangered species unit. In addition, he said, the state has released 148 peregrine falcons, with six pairs nesting.</p>
        <p>The lynx program is being operated separately by Syracuse as part of a $185,000 grant by the State Legislature to study wildlife and to bring information about wildlife to the schools. Creating 'Lynx Territory'</p>
        <p>Once the lynxes are brought into the state, Dr. Brocke and his associates will try to keep them there by spraying lynx scent in the area to establish boundaries.</p>
        <p>''Lynxes tend to stay where other lynxes are,'' he said. ''The scent will give them the idea that this is lynx territory and, hopefully, they'll stay there.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Brocke called the lynx ''a most interesting and unusual cat.'' Smaller than a cougar but larger than a house cat, the lynx is often mistaken for the bobcat, which is its major competitor for territorial rights.</p>
        <p>Through a complicated chain of events, it was the bobcat that drove the lynx from New York in the late 1800's.</p>
        <p>Until then, the lynx was native to the Adirondacks - an area with heavy snowfall, spruce fir forests and a large population of snowshoe hares, its main food. But large-scale cutting of trees for timber there opened land, which led to an increase in deer, then bobcats, which fed on the deer. An aggressive animal, the bobcat displaced the lynx, a retiring creature.</p>
        <p>Now, things are changing in the Adirondacks, Dr. Brocke said, making it possible for the lynx to come back and thrive.</p>
        <p>''Land that once was logged is reverting to the state, the forest is growing up, the deer population is falling, which is leading to a change in the density of bobcats, opening a niche for the lynx,'' he said. Lynx to Come From Canada</p>
        <p>Dr. Brocke and his associates plan two ''plantings'' of lynx to be trapped in Canada. Both plantings will be south of Lake Placid, in the vicinity of Mount Marcy, the highest mountain in New York State.</p>
        <p>Research has shown that the lynx, with longer legs than the bobcat and with well-protected pads on the bottom of its feet, thrives in snowy areas above 2,500 feet in elevation where the bobcat finds it difficult to stay above the snow.</p>
        <p>''Next year, we plan to bring in 12 cats, eight of them pregnant females,'' he said. ''If they aren't pregnant naturally, we will inseminate them artificially. And in 1989, we will bring in 12 more.</p>
        <p>''It won't be a process of just capturing and dumping them in the wilderness. We will carefully monitor them, using radio transmitters on each.''</p>
