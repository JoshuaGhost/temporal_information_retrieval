        <p>LEAD: Dr. Robert J. Schnitzer, a specialist in chemotherapy and one of those who developed a principal drug used against tuberculosis, died yesterday at his home in Nutley, N.J. He was 92 years old.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert J. Schnitzer, a specialist in chemotherapy and one of those who developed a principal drug used against tuberculosis, died yesterday at his home in Nutley, N.J. He was 92 years old.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schnitzer led the way in the 1940's in the development of the drug, Isoniazid, or INH, which was used in the effort to eradicate tuberculosis in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schnitzer, who was born in Germany and earned his medical degree from the University of Berlin in 1919, fled Nazi persecution in 1939 and came to the United States in 1941.</p>
        <p>He settled in Nutley in that year and became the head of chemotherapy research at Hoffman-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company in Nutley. He retired from the company in 1960.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schnitzer became a member of the editorial board of a medical journal, Environmental Research, and joined the environmental research division of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, where he also lectured on chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Peggy; a daughter, Muriel Mota of Roseland, N.J.; a son, Bertram, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and five grandchildren.</p>
