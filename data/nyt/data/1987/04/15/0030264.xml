        <p>LEAD: The Soviet Union announced today that it would rent three tankers to Kuwait to transport oil through the Persian Gulf, and raised the possibility that Soviet warships might escort them.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union announced today that it would rent three tankers to Kuwait to transport oil through the Persian Gulf, and raised the possibility that Soviet warships might escort them.</p>
        <p>The arrangement, which Kuwait requested in hopes of reducing the danger of Iranian attacks on their oil shipments, could bring the first regular Soviet naval traffic in the gulf.</p>
        <p>''The Soviet tankers can be escorted by warships if the Soviet side thinks it necessary,'' a Soviet spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said at a news conference in announcing the agreement, negotiated between Kuwait and the Soviet Ministry of the Maritime Fleet. U.S. Aides Voicing Concern</p>
        <p>He told reporters later that the issue of naval escorts was now being discussed within the Soviet Government.</p>
        <p>American officials voiced concern about the prospect of Soviet naval convoys in the gulf.</p>
        <p>''Warships mean a political presence and the ability to intervene,'' an American said. ''It is an area we have defined as vital to U.S. interests.''  [ In Washington, officials said they were opposed to a formal Soviet role in protecting Kuwaiti shipping in the gulf. But they said it was too early to judge the significance of the Soviet announcement. ]  Kuwait has been negotiating with several nations, including the United States, about using their flags for oil transport, on the assumption that superpower flagships would be less likely to come under Iranian attack.</p>
        <p>Kuwait has sided with Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, and Kuwaiti vessels have become targets for Iran. American intelligence experts say the threat has increased with the installation of Chinese-made anti-ship missiles on the Iranian side of the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
        <p>Kuwait is one of two gulf countries to have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union - the other is Oman -and favors a centrist position between the superpowers.</p>
        <p>State Department officials said recently that Kuwait, reluctant to openly admit the need for foreign protection, had rejected an American offer to provide naval escorts for Kuwaiti-flag tankers. Instead, Kuwait proposed that their ships fly the American flag. American officials said today the idea was under consideration.</p>
        <p>Kuwait, with about 1.3 million barrels a day, is the fourth largest Persian Gulf producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. About two-thirds of Kuwaiti oil exports go to Western Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, in a discussion with reporters, first said the ships rented from the Soviet Union would fly Kuwaiti flags, but he then consulted his notes and said, ''It is possible in the future that they would fly Soviet flags.'' Response to U.S. Naval Moves Western diplomats said it was unlikely that Kuwait would welcome a Soviet military escort if the ships were flying the Kuwaiti flag, for the same reason they have spurned offers of American naval protection.</p>
        <p>The agreement with Kuwait is a sign of Soviet uneasiness about efforts to fortify the American position in the gulf.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger recently ordered the Navy to station an aircraft carrier with several escorts near the Persian Gulf at all times in an effort to fulfill President Reagan's pledge to keep oil supplies flowing to the allies in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>American diplomats have also renewed promises of support to Persian Gulf states, in an effort to assure them that the United States does not plan to reduce its role in the region after the secret arms deliveries to Iran.</p>
        <p>After reports of the increased United States naval presence, Mr. Gerasimov last week accused the United States of building up tensions in the region in hopes of ''intimidating the countries of the Persian Gulf to force them to invite the United States to become their protector.''</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union has also stepped up its diplomatic activities in the region. Mr. Gerasimov announced today that a Deputy Foreign Minister, Vladimir F. Petrovsky, would visit Kuwait, Iraq, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union and the United States have taken similar positions on the Iran-Iraq war, calling for a negotiated settlement but, barring that, favoring the defeat of Iran.  ---- U.S. OPPOSES SOVIET ROLE</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, April 14 (Special to The New York Times) - Administration officials said today that they were opposed to any formal Soviet role in protecting Kuwaiti shipping in the Persian Gulf. But they added that it was too early to judge the significance of the announcement in Moscow.</p>
        <p>The announcement raised the possibility that Soviet military vessels might escort the Soviet tankers carrying Kuwaiti oil. But American officials said it was not yet clear that they would do so.</p>
