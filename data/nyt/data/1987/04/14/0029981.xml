        <p>LEAD: Heavy selling of mortgage-backed securities plus fears that the Federal Reserve was tacitly encouraging higher short-term interest rates led to sharply lower prices for notes and bonds yesterday.</p>
        <p>Heavy selling of mortgage-backed securities plus fears that the Federal Reserve was tacitly encouraging higher short-term interest rates led to sharply lower prices for notes and bonds yesterday.</p>
        <p>Tepid investor demand led securities dealers to reduce prices of long-term Treasury issues by about 1/4 point early in the day. But the momentum to lower prices gained strength shortly before noon when the Fed failed to counteract recent increases in overnight rates.</p>
        <p>The steepest price declines came in the afternoon as securities dealers sold Treasury issues to protect themselves against losses on mortgage-backed issues they had bought or were committed to buy.</p>
        <p>By late in the day, the bellwether 7 1/2 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016 were offered at 90 23/32, down about 1 3/4 points, to yield 8.35 percent. As recently as March 26, the 30-year bond was yielding 7.55 percent. 10-Year Notes at 8.17% Among shorter maturites, 10-year Treasury notes were yielding 8.17 percent, while two-year notes were at 7.14 percent.</p>
        <p>Because the Treasury market serves as a benchmark for other interest rates, the higher yields on government issues have spread to the corporate and mortgage markets.</p>
        <p>Interest rates on home mortgages, for example, will be rising sharply in the near future, as indicated by the increase in rates at which the Federal National Mortgage Assocation will issue 30-day commitments to buy conventional mortgages. The 30-day commitment rate yesterday rose to 9.9 percent from 9.63 percent last Friday, 9.19 percent April 8 and 8.62 percent March 25.</p>
        <p>In the mortgage securities market, where trading volume often exceeds the long-term Treasury bond market, securities dealers said there was heavy selling yesterday by mortgage banking firms and savings and loan associations. Among active issues, the Government National Mortgage Association 9 percent pass-throughs fell about 3 points, to a price of 95 and a yield of 9.68 percent.</p>
        <p>Because of the recent increase in interest rates, mortgage bankers expect that a higher-than-normal percentage of the mortgage commitments issued in last few weeks will be exercised. Unfortunately for those who did not fully protect themselves against the risk of rising interest rates, current market conditions indicate that they will have to sell the mortgages (or the mortgage pass-through securities backed by the mortgages) at much lower prices than when they were originated. Traders Alarmed</p>
        <p>In the short-term market, traders reacted quickly to the Fed's unwillingness to provide reserves more aggressively to the banking system. Although many economists doubt there has been any significant adjustment in monetary policy, traders were alarmed enough to raise Trasury bill rates by about two-tenths of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>The outstanding three-month bills rose above 6 percent for the first time since last June. Rates rose sharply at the regular weekly auction of new bills, where the three-month issue averaged 5.98 percent, up from 5.53 percent a week ago, while the six-month issue was at 6.08 percent, up from 5.63 percent.</p>
        <p>The rise in Treasury bill rates, along with other short-term issues such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper, was enough to revive speculation that large banks would soon announce another increase in the prime lending rate of 7 3/4 percent.</p>
        <p>After averaging about 6 1/8 percent from last November though April 8, the closely watched overnight loan rate has averaged around 6 3/8 percent in the last four trading sessions. Traders point to the higher overnight rate as evidence that the Fed is tightening policy to discourage further declines in the dollar, but many economists see the higher rate as temporary.</p>
        <p>''The Fed could have calmed the markets, but instead they seem to have passively acquiesced to higher interest rates,'' said John R. Williams, a vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. He added that weak money supply growth in the last two months, economic data showing signs of sluggish growth, and low inflation were reasons why he did not expect an overt move to a tigher monetary policy. Corporate Bonds Lower</p>
        <p>As corporate bond prices moved lower in sympathy with the Treasury market, there were no large new issues offered yesterday. So far, the sharp increase in yields has discouraged corporate borrowers rather than touching off a rush to sell bonds in anticipation of higher yields in the future. Yields for new long-term bonds are now more than half a percentage point higher than would have been required two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>The steepest price declines in the corporate market were for bonds of Texaco, which filed for bankruptcy protection over the weekend. The volume of bonds actually changing hands was light because investors are still figuring out the implications of a bankruptcy filing by a solvent company that is operationally sound.</p>
        <p>For some bonds due in 1991 through 1994 with interest coupons of 13 percent to 13 5/8 percent, price quotes fell from about 95 late last week to less than 70, with some bonds changing hands at prices in the mid-80's. At a price of 85, the 13 5/8 percent bonds due in 1994 yield about 17.3 percent, again assuming interest payments are made.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange, where prices of odd lots closely match the prices for bonds traded in the wholesale over-the-counter market, Texaco's 8 1/2 percent issue due in 2006 was last traded at a price of 75, to yield about 11.9 percent (assuming interest payments were made), down from about 82 to yield 10.4 percent last Friday.</p>
        <p>Because the Texaco filing was the result of its lawsuit with Pennzoil, and not an industrywide problem, the effect of the suspension of interest payments on its $8.4 billion of bonds did not spread to other sectors of the high-yield bond market.</p>
        <p>The move to lower prices and higher yields was also readily evident in the tax-exempt market, where bonds that traded with yields of less than 7 percent a month ago are now bringing well over 8 percent. The Municipal Bond Index, a measure of long-term bond yields compiled by The Bond Buyer, rose yesterday to 8.28 percent, from 8.04 percent. As recently as March 13, the index was at 6.98 percent.</p>
        <p>Although the supply of new tax-exempt issues has been light in the last few weeks, the market has been hit by lower prices in the Treasury sector and large sales by mutual bond funds investing in tax-exempt issues.</p>
        <p>Thomas S. Buckmeyer, a municipal market analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Company, said that open-end tax-exempt bond funds had sold more than $600 million of bonds in the last two weeks. Shareholders in the funds are redeeming their holdings to make income tax payments, he said.</p>
