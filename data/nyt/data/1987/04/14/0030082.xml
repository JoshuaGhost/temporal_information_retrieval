        <p>LEAD: The operators of North General Hospital, the only minority-run voluntary hospital in New York State, have reached an agreement that would give them complete ownership of the Harlem center and significantly ease the financial problems that have dogged its eight-year existence.</p>
        <p>The operators of North General Hospital, the only minority-run voluntary hospital in New York State, have reached an agreement that would give them complete ownership of the Harlem center and significantly ease the financial problems that have dogged its eight-year existence.</p>
        <p>The 200-bed community hospital, at 124th Street and Madison Avenue, has been leased by the operators since 1979 from the Orthopedic Institute, which had run it for 66 years as a special-care center. Under the agreement, the operators will take title to the three buildings, receive a $2 million gift from the institute and forgiveness of rent arrears.</p>
        <p>The agreement last week represents an amicable conclusion to negotiations that were often bitter because of the operators' contentions that the Orthopedic Institute had failed to leave them with a financially viable institution. The transfer of ownership will help insure the survival of a general-care operation in a neighborhood that is medically underserved, state health officials said. Also, the transition from white control to black control is important at a time when race relations in the city have been uneasy, negotiators and health officials said.</p>
        <p>''This is a great example of individuals from different backgrounds getting together to accomplish something that is good for everyone,'' said Kenneth Rasky, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents the region's voluntary hospitals. Institute Moved in '79</p>
        <p>North General has a $50 million-a-year budget and, in addition to operating the hospital, houses a nursing school, alcohol and drug treatment programs and one of the city's largest home attendant programs. It employs 2,100 people.</p>
        <p>The hospital was turned over to the minority-controlled corporation in 1979, when the institute moved into a new building at 301 East 17th Street.</p>
        <p>Eugene McCabe, president of North General since 1979, said the agreement calls for the hospital to take over repayment of a $4 million loan that helped refurbish the emergency room and intensive-care operations. As part of the pact, the State Health Department has agreed to settle millions of dollars in disputed Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement claims filed by the Orthopedic Institute.</p>
        <p>''Nirvana is not here yet,'' said Mr. McCabe, ''but this agreement improves our financial picture a whole lot and it allows us to plan for the future. Without owning the building, there were so many things we could not do. We are already one of the largest employers in Harlem and I think we are now on our way to becoming one of its stronger institutions.'' $125 Million Renovation Planned He said the agreement would make it possible for the hospital to embark on a planned $125 million renovation and debt restructuring program under state legislation intended to aid financially distressed hospitals.</p>
        <p>North General had been barred from participating in the program because one of the requirements is that the hospital own its building.</p>
        <p>Harvey Machaver, executive director of the Orthopedic Institute, said that the agreement would free the Institute of the costly commitment it had made to operate its own specialized treatment and research center downtown while keeping open the chance for a viable general hospital in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Machaver and Mr. McCabe credited the state's Health Commissioner, David Axlerod, with not only helping to sustain North General through several financial crises, but also for bringing about the breakthrough in the negotiations over the transfer.</p>
        <p>Six months ago state officials offered to settle millions of dollars in longstanding and disputed Orthopedic Institute reimbursement claims in exchange for the institute's agreement to transfer ownership of North General's buildings and providing other assistance.</p>
        <p>''We got involved and found that there were some things that we could do to make Orthopedic Institute better able to help North General,'' said Mark Van Guysling, the state's assistant deputy director for health care financing in the state agency. ''It has been the feeling of this department that Orthopedic Institute left North General high and dry when they pulled out and so we were trying to correct the situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rasky, of the Greater New York Hospital Association, and others noted that almost from its beginnings in 1979 North General's financial fortunes seemed clouded, although the need for the hospital was clear. That same year the city-run Sydenham Hospital had been closed amid charges that Harlem's health needs were being neglected, Mr. McCabe said.</p>
        <p>But the state helped with everything from payrolls to Medicaid reimbursements at ''strategic'' times, said Mr. McCabe, and North General survived. In addition, private fund-raising efforts by black and white business figures and cooperation from Local 1199 of the Hospital and Health Care Employees Union also helped the hospital survive. Basil A. Paterson, the lawyer for North General, said that with the accord on the ownership of the building, the hospital has gone from nearly closing to ''possibly becoming one of the great stories of cooperation'' in the city.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of concerns about race relations in the city now and this is an example of a black hosptial and largely Jewish hospital getting together to meet a need,'' said Mr. McCabe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Machaver agreed, adding that the final negotiations between the two hospitals came at a time when ''it was so easy for people to feel bruised.''</p>
        <p>''But the world is not what it was 50 years ago,'' he added. ''It is less important that North General be a great integrated institution than it is that it be a great black institution with which the Jewish community is invited to participate.''</p>
