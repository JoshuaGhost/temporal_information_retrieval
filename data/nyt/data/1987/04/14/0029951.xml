        <p>LEAD: The Mets did not retrieve Dave Magadan from the disabled list yesterday, the first day he was eligible to return to active duty. But they were expected to restore him to the team by the end of the week, and Magadan reported from Florida: ''I consider myself back to normal.''</p>
        <p>The Mets did not retrieve Dave Magadan from the disabled list yesterday, the first day he was eligible to return to active duty. But they were expected to restore him to the team by the end of the week, and Magadan reported from Florida: ''I consider myself back to normal.''</p>
        <p>Magadan, the rookie third baseman with the hot bat, does not rank with Dwight Gooden and Roger McDowell, the two pitching aces who also opened the season on the disabled list. But he is one of the sharpest young hitters on the club, and his return would help the Mets trim their medical losses and regain some of the offensive and infield depth that they prized.</p>
        <p>''It's up to them when I come up,'' Magadan said by telephone from St. Petersburg, where he has been working out since the team left spring training last week. ''I know they're monitoring me. I'm patient, but I think I'm back to normal. I'm hitting well, and reacting to the ball at third base instead of letting it play me.''</p>
        <p>The Mets did not disclose any decision yet on Magadan, but it was believed likely that they would let him play in a few more practice games in Florida and then activate him by the end of the week. He has played in four minor leagues in his career, and hit .300 or more in all four, and he hit .444 in the National League in his brief debut last September. Spring Training Disrupted</p>
        <p>Manager Dave Johnson said this spring that Magadan would be the reserve at third base behind Howard Johnson, and might even become the reserve at first base behind Keith Hernandez. But the rookie's spring training was disrupted last month when he developed an infection in the lymph nodes beneath his right arm. When the infection persisted, he was sent to New York for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        <p>A biopsy taken on March 20 showed no malignancy, but he was found to be suffering from a viral infection, perhaps caused by a scratch from his pet cat. He was placed on the disabled list on March 29, and was left behind when the Mets flew North on April 5. At the time, he was not able to lift his arm without pain. But he has been working out for the last week in the major leagues' extended training program for injured players and rookies not yet assigned to leagues in progress.</p>
        <p>Magadan played in his first practice game last Saturday, and got three hits. He played in another yesterday, and got one hit off Ken Dayley of the St. Louis Cardinals. He has 4 for 9, with two doubles, and has knocked in four runs.</p>
        <p>''I could see the difference since Saturday,'' he said. ''My reaction time is getting quicker. I got involved in two double plays in the field, one of them on a line drive. I'm ready to return.''</p>
        <p>The Mets didn't seem to need much help when they opened the season by winning three straight games. But then they lost two in a row to the Atlanta Braves, and seemed more vulnerable. They open a nine-game trip tonight in Philadelphia, and continue to St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Pedrique Replaced Magadan</p>
        <p>When Magadan was disabled, his place on the 24-man roster was taken by Al Pedrique, the rookie infielder who has played nine years in the minor leagues, mostly at shortstop and second base. But when Magadan returns, Pedrique may not be the player dropped to make room for him.</p>
        <p>Pedrique may win a reprieve because Rafael Santana, the regular shortstop, opened the season by going hitless in 16 times at bat. He finally got a single Sunday, and will open the trip with 1 for 17 and an .059 average. If Dave Johnson pinch-hits for him in close games, he would probably prefer a good defensive shortstop as the backup, especially with the game on the line.</p>
        <p>Consequently, Johnson was believed likely to drop one of his two spare catchers to make room for Magadan, either the rookie, Barry Lyons, or the more experienced Clint Hurdle. Either way, Magadan was expected to rejoin the team during the road trip that begins tonight.</p>
