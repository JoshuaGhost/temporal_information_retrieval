        <p>LEAD: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, under criticism for volatile trading in its stock index markets, announced yesterday that it had named Paul O'Kelly as chief compliance officer and said he would run a stiffer surveillance program.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, under criticism for volatile trading in its stock index markets, announced yesterday that it had named Paul O'Kelly as chief compliance officer and said he would run a stiffer surveillance program.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Kelly, 37, has spent the last 13 years in the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chicago office as a securities regulator. The S.E.C. does not regulate commodities trading - that is the province of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission - and Mr. O'Kelly said he had not had a great deal of experience in regulating commodities.</p>
        <p>He has, however, a good reputation as a regulator. Mr. O'Kelly is currently assistant regional administrator at the S.E.C. At the Mercantile Exchange, he will hold the title of vice president of compliance.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Kelly, a lawyer, has practiced with the S.E.C since graduation from Loyola of Chicago and its law school.</p>
        <p>He said that as part of a package of improvements planned at the exchange, three floor investigators would be added along with five compliance staff members. Some will work with a new computerized program to monitor trades. The program is scheduled to begin July 1. ''We're working out the last bugs in it now,'' Mr. O'Kelly said.  Criticism at the exchange has centered on the Standard &amp; Poor's stock index futures and options division. The exchange's surveillance has not been able to keep up with the increased volatility and volume, and members have been faulted for trading for their own account while trading for customers' accounts. ''Some order has to be restored to the S.&amp; P. pit,'' Mr. O'Kelly said.</p>
        <p>A special membership referendum will be held next Monday to determine whether dual trading should continue.</p>
        <p>The exchange's board opposes the elimination of dual trading on the ground that it would harm liquidity. Officials have urged members to reject the ban on dual trading in favor of new rules and increased surveillance.</p>
        <p>Trading in the index futures on the Chicago exchange has grown in importance, since many computer-directed trading programs are based on its performance. So-called programmed trading has been cited for increased volatility in the stock market.</p>
