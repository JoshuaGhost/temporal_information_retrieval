        <p>LEAD: The effect of the Federal Communications Commission's warning last week that it would no longer turn a deaf ear to what it defines as obscenity on the airwaves can be seen in radio- and television-station board rooms, where executives are re-examining obscenity policy, and can be measured at the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>The effect of the Federal Communications Commission's warning last week that it would no longer turn a deaf ear to what it defines as obscenity on the airwaves can be seen in radio- and television-station board rooms, where executives are re-examining obscenity policy, and can be measured at the F.C.C. switchboard, which is receiving scores of calls from stations asking for clarification of the sweeping decision.</p>
        <p>But it is best heard on the radio itself, where disk jockeys are toning down their acts while using the airwaves to express anger at the new rules. It was radio stations that the F.C.C. chastised last week, and it is radio personalities who seem to be fighting back.</p>
        <p>Howard Stern, the New-York based host of a four-hour morning program heard in New York, Washington and Philadelphia, has talked about little else since the F.C.C. released its decision on Thursday. Mr. Stern has been proudly telling listeners that his program was one of the catalysts for the policy change - in fact, WYSP-FM in Philadelphia was singled out by the commission for the suggestive language on his show, though WXRK-FM in New York and WBMW-FM in Fairfax, Va., which simulcast the program, were not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern spent much of yesterday morning airing supportive calls from such celebrities as Robin Leach, host of ''Life Styles of the Rich and Famous,'' and Lisa Sliwa, a head of the Guardian Angels. ''I am the last bastion of the First Amendment,'' Mr. Stern told his listeners, urging them to attend a rally that is being planned to protest the F.C.C. decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern's spokesman, Don Buchwald, said no interviews would be given on the subject of the F.C.C. ruling. Satirical Explanation</p>
        <p>On WNBC-AM yesterday, Don Imus aired a conversation with a fictional F.C.C. official who attempted to explain the new rules. In the course of the skit, the ''commissioner'' cursed once or twice, used sexual innuendo, made ethnically slanted remarks and announced that two of the words that would be banned on the air are ''Howard and Stern.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Imus explained to the ''commissioner'' that, ''I've tried to be as offensive as possible; I've written letters turning myself in.''</p>
        <p>Such banter can be called restrained compared with the routines performed by both Mr. Imus and Mr. Stern before the F.C.C. ruling. The men were leaders in a nationwide trend of morning radio designed to shock the audience.</p>
        <p>The program director of WNBC, Dale Parsons, said Mr. Imus and other on-air personalities were aware that new restraint was necessary, though no meetings had been called on the subject and no memos written. ''Imus deals in a lot of innuendo,'' Mr. Parsons said. ''He's been in the business long enough. He knows where that line is and where not to cross.''</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, however, stations are evaluating their policies -or lack thereof - regarding obscenity. Many executives, such as Larry Berger, program director of WPLJ-FM in New York, say they have no prescribed policy. ''It's not written down, it just kind of comes out of my head,'' he said, adding that a written version would be developed shortly. Content Review to Continue</p>
        <p>WNBC issued a statement pointing out that the station had a written policy and a broadcast standards department to enforce it, and would continue to ''ensure the appropriateness of all entertainment programming by carefully reviewing all entertainment program content.''</p>
        <p>The general counsel for Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Stephen A. Weiswasser, said, ''We will be studying what the commission has done and whether it requires any policy changes on our part.''</p>
        <p>Several station managers in the New York area called the new policy vague. The F.C.C. said only that it would begin enforcing the 1976 definition of obscenity as ''language or material that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for WABC-FM, Mark Mason, said he was concerned that the definition could be applied to such public service programs as psychology call-in programs or programs about AIDS. ''When someone calls to talk about sexual dysfunction its hard to help them without talking graphically and using certain words,'' he said. ''No doubt someone will find this offensive. It's hard to say anything on the air without someone being offended.''</p>
        <p>Most station executives also expressed discomfort with the increased involvement of the F.C.C. in program content. ''The byword of the day is chilling,'' Mr. Mason said. ''There are shades of Big Brother.''</p>
