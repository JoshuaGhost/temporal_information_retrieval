        <p>LEAD: Associate Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court said Thursday night that the laws of the United States could suffer from an ''erosion of moral responsibility'' if Americans continued to honor what is technically legal over what is morally right.</p>
        <p>Associate Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court said Thursday night that the laws of the United States could suffer from an ''erosion of moral responsibility'' if Americans continued to honor what is technically legal over what is morally right.</p>
        <p>''The deterioration of social virtues leads to a deterioration of social freedom,'' Justice Scalia told lawyers and law students at the annual dinner of the Rutgers Law School.</p>
        <p>He cited the Federal bankruptcy laws, which he said allow some of those who declare bankruptcy to remain rich at the expense of creditors, as examples of laws that ''do not provide for something just.''</p>
        <p>People frequently presume the lawful action is always right, Justice Scalia said. He also cited the young boy who spits on a sidewalk and asserts, ''It's a free country.''</p>
        <p>''We are willing to fight and die for the freedom to be irresponsible,'' he said, adding that this applied to journalists who defend themselves against libel actions by saying the proof is insufficient.</p>
        <p>Justice Scalia asserted that when Americans say they are celebrating the country's laws, they usually are speaking of the Bill of Rights, which he said is the opposite of law. ''It is a charter of freedom from laws,'' he said. ''It restricts the lawmakers.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke, a small group of Rutgers law students demonstrated outside against the law school's inviting of a conservative jurist.</p>
        <p>Marian Wise, a member of the law school's Student Bar Association, said the objections were directed at Justice Scalia's dissent in last week's Supreme Court ruling that supported affirmative action in the hiring of women and members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>Thursday's issue of the student newspaper said, ''The Rutgers Law Record strongly opposes the bestowal of any honors upon this dangerous, reactionary foe of affirmative action and all the progressive issues that our school stands for.''</p>
