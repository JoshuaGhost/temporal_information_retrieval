        <p>LEAD: These are the times that try brides' souls. It's 10:50 A.M. on Fifth Avenue - Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that is. In precisely 10 minutes, I. Kleinfeld &amp; Son, the store that is to wedding gowns what the Pentagon is to fighter bombers, will open.</p>
        <p>These are the times that try brides' souls. It's 10:50 A.M. on Fifth Avenue - Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, that is. In precisely 10 minutes, I. Kleinfeld &amp; Son, the store that is to wedding gowns what the Pentagon is to fighter bombers, will open.</p>
        <p>Already, anticipation is wafting through the air like a June breeze through a wedding gown. Young women and their retinues, a veritable bridal wave, wait in the lobby, some clutching dog-eared bridal magazines. They are in pursuit of their wedding day ''aura.'' They await the wisdom of Miss Judith, Miss Iman, Miss Irene, Miss Flo and the other Kleinfeld bridal consultants who, ferreting through the store's 800 or so wedding-dress styles (by appointment only), will help them find the dress. The one that makes them look, Miss Flo said, as if they ''came down from a cloud.'' The perfect confection that will cause the sales consultant to utter, with motherly pride, ''This brings out your internal beauty, my love. You don't need glitter to shine.'' Taffeta, Tulle and Trains</p>
        <p>Before the seasonal onslaught of fondue pots and electric woks, brides face fundamental life choices. These concern veils (bird cage or cathedral?), necklines (off the shoulder?), fabrics (taffeta, tulle, slipper satin, organza?) and lengths (how does she look with a cathedral train tumbling two and a half yards from her waist?).</p>
        <p>Within the dappled pink walls of Kleinfeld's 23 fitting rooms that form the centerpiece of the 11,000-square-foot store (nearby there is a separate 4,000-square-foot store for bridesmaids, reached by a Kleinfeld limousine) life's truths emerge.</p>
        <p>''I look at their figure,'' explained a sales consultant, Ilene Connolly, who has outfitted brides at Kleinfeld's for 18 years. ''Then I bring them the dress they'll look thinnest in.''</p>
        <p>Each month the store, still a family-run operation, sells between 500 and 600 bridal gowns costing an average of $1,000 to $1,500, including headpiece. Inspired, perhaps, by the weddings of Caroline Kennedy and Sarah Ferguson, brides last year bought more than 6,000 dresses worth a total of $7 million at Kleinfeld's, according to the management, with an additional $1.5 million to $2 million in bridesmaids' dresses. Leader in Sales</p>
        <p>On any Saturday from January through May, prime shopping time for June brides, Kleinfeld's will outfit more than 50 brides. Chain bridal shops and department stores do a brisk business at this time of year, too, but Kleinfeld's is the acknowledged leader in total retail sales for one store, according to Bride's magazine. As such it is ''a venerable New York institution,'' said Barbara Tober, editor in chief of Bride's.</p>
        <p>The brides come ''from as far as Nigeria and Ohio,'' said Hedda Kleinfeld Schachter, also known as Miss Hedda or Mrs. K., who runs the business along with her husband, Jack Schachter - Mr. K. The K's as in Kleinfeld are inherited from Mrs. Schachter's father, Isadore Kleinfeld, who founded the store as a fur business in 1941.</p>
        <p>They rule their kingdom with crusaders' zeal. One recent afternoon, Mrs. K foraged through her inventory in search of a dress a customer had seen at Henri Bendel. She experienced genuine angst when she could not find it.</p>
        <p>As befits the monumental nature of marriage, emotions run high. Gabriela Ibarra had flown in with her mother, Olga, from Mexico City to search for a dress she had seen in Sposabella, an Italian fashion magazine. Her sales consultant, Miss Iman, procured the dress, a $2,500 Italian import. ''I want it very, very tight, because I'm going to lose six pounds,'' Miss Ibarra instructed her fitter, Miss Flora.</p>
        <p>''Ten pounds in a bridal dress is only three-quarters of an inch,'' Miss Flora said sternly. Upon hearing the news, the bride's face wilted like a two-day-old floral centerpiece.</p>
        <p>In another room, Miss Flo was trying to dissuade another customer from a revealing, sequin-studded gown. ''You can wear a dress like this to a disco, do you understand what I'm saying?'' Miss Flo said. ''Only once in your life are you going to be a bride.'' ''Hopefully,'' the bride said. ''Yes, hopefully,'' Miss Flo said solemnly.</p>
        <p>Sometimes there are prewedding breakups. ''It's a problem,'' said Mr. K. ''We're in no position to return merchandise.'' At Kleinfeld's, as in most bridal shops, every dress is special-ordered, a process that takes two to four months. If a wedding is canceled, the customer forfeits her deposit, generally a third or less of the cost of the dress, and the store sells it for the balance.</p>
        <p>To the uninitiated, the prices can be devastating. ''You're a $2,000 kid,'' said one mother, comforting her daughter after handing back a $2,000 dress.</p>
        <p>In early spring, customers can wait up to a month to get a Saturday appointment. According to Ron LoVece of LoVece Ltd., a New York bridal gown designer and manufacturer, part of the reason is that ''Kleinfeld's is probably the most adventurous retailer in America, which is amazing when you think of the locale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Schachter remain in Brooklyn because ''where would you get this kind of space in Manhattan?'' said Mr. K. His wife continually scouts new fashion territory, traveling to Italy, France and England to buy from the new collections. Compared to ready-to-wear, the bridal business is relatively constant (''Sometimes you get blinded by all the white,'' Mrs. K. said, sighing), but styles do change with the season and social mores. White for First-Timers</p>
        <p>Kleinfeld's scope reflects the expanding bridal fashion scene, where pure-white, full-length dresses with cathedral trains once reigned. The average bride visiting Kleinfeld's is in her late 20's or early 30's, according to Mrs. K. Although most first-timers still choose pure white (''for skin tone, not for symbolism'') today's bride ''has a will of her own,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''She's educated,'' Mrs. K. said. ''Many buy their own gowns, with a better income than women had 30 years ago.'' Today's brides even have a choice of color (touches of blush pink under white or ivory are popular this season). Bridesmaids' dresses are more daring, some with pink and black leopard spots or in gold and silver lame. ''Bridesmaids want to be sexy,'' Mrs. K. said. ''After all, they're future brides.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. K has some philosophical thoughts about brides-to-be. ''These poor girls go through such a pressured period,'' she said. ''I wish they could be more relaxed. I've never heard of a wedding or bride that's not beautiful in the end.''</p>
        <p>Her words may not relax those for whom the profusion of choices can be bewildering.</p>
        <p>Michelle Caroline Morley, a 26-year-old bride from Hamden, Conn., was modeling her gown at Kleinfeld's one day. It was a pink-tinged, off-the-shoulder silk and lace dress reminiscent of something Scarlett O'Hara might have worn.</p>
        <p>How did she want to look on her wedding day? ''Like a princess, I guess,'' she said wearily. Despite the fatigue, there was a note of triumph in her voice. She looked beautiful. She didn't need glitter to shine.</p>
