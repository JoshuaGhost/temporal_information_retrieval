        <p>LEAD: Members of the two committees that will monitor Texaco Inc. during its bankruptcy proceedings yesterday chose a representative of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to head one panel and one each from the Pennzoil Company and Tenneco Inc. to head the other.</p>
        <p>Members of the two committees that will monitor Texaco Inc. during its bankruptcy proceedings yesterday chose a representative of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to head one panel and one each from the Pennzoil Company and Tenneco Inc. to head the other.</p>
        <p>Pennzoil and Tenneco will direct the committee of seven oil companies that are creditors of Texaco.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Life will lead the 19 members of the general creditors committee, which includes banks, insurance companies, an energy-industry union and companies including I.B.M. and Xerox.</p>
        <p>Pennzoil's selection as a co-chairman fulfilled an earlier request. The company said on Monday, when the two panels were selected, that it wanted to be chairman or co-chairman of the panel on which it was given a seat.</p>
        <p>The committees will draft their own procedures; choose counsel, investment bankers and other advisers, and also determine what powers to give their chairman.</p>
        <p>Deborah A. Alford, Texaco's manager of media relations, said it had ''no objection to Pennzoil's participation on the second committee in whatever capacity it may serve, and given the amount of Pennzoil's asserted claim, which Texaco disputes, it's not surprising that the members of the industry creditors' committee would appoint it co-chairman.''</p>
        <p>Charles F. Luce, the special counsel for Metropolitan Life and the former chairman of the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will continue as chairman of the general creditors' committee. James Shaddix, associate general counsel of Pennzoil, and Robert Lawrie, associate general counsel of Tenneco, will direct the oil-industry committee.</p>
        <p>The committee meetings, which were private, began at 9 A.M. at the Manhattan headquarters of Metropolitan Life.</p>
        <p>Harry Jones, the United States trustee for the bankruptcy, said he had not been informed of the committees' decisions and said he did not expect to hear from them until they chose their attorneys.</p>
        <p>Despite the selection of chairmen, many questions remained about the actual operation of the committees. Chief among them was whether Texaco would feel able to provide the general creditors committee information that it thought might give the other oil companies an unfair competitive advantage if it reached them. It also was not known whether Pennzoil's appointment would be challenged by Texaco shareholders.</p>
        <p>Bankruptcy experts and oil-industry analysts unconnected with the case praised Mr. Jones's decision to name two creditors' committees, which was seen as a means of screening Pennzoil and other oil companies from information about Texaco that the company considers competitive.</p>
        <p>One bankruptcy specialist, who asked not to be identified, said that Pennzoil had no right to such sensitive information because of the lawsuit between the two companies and that the other oil companies would not want to see it because it could open them to accusations of anti-trust violations.</p>
        <p>Frank P. Knuettel, an oil analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, said of the two-committee structure: ''It gives Pennzoil a voice, but not as full a voice as its damage award against Texaco theoretically would give it -because that's still an open issue.''</p>
        <p>Some bankruptcy lawyers said that, despite the nominal separation of the committees, it was likely the two panels would work closely and that Pennzoil's influence would be substantial.</p>
        <p>But one attorney at a major New York law firm, who asked not to be identified, said the two-committee structure ''clearly diminishes'' Pennzoil's potential for influencing the behavior of both committees.</p>
        <p>Another bankruptcy specialist said that ''it remains to be seen whether this isolates Pennzoil.'' He added, ''If the general committee becomes the 'real' committee and the other one the 'rump' committee, then the answer would probably be yes.''</p>
        <p>But this person added, ''I don't think the other oil companies, which are undisputed creditors of Texaco, are going to accept being isolated from the decision making.''  COMPANY NEWS</p>
