        <p>CONVERSATION overheard (and scrawled on a slightly soggy cocktail napkin) by Joe Brescia, a late-night reveler about town. The place is Tunnel, an in-vogue club in Manhattan. There, in the wee hours of a recent morning, a young man in up-to-date attire bumps into a leather-jacketed, long-haired man. The snazzy dresser does a double take. ''Ah, Rick,'' he stammers. ''Um, Rick . . . ah . . . ''</p>
        <p>The leather-jacketed man fills in the blank: ''Yeah - Derringer. I'm Rick Derringer.''</p>
        <p>His admirer continues: ''Hey, I remember you from that 60's group . . . the, um, ah . . . '' ''McCoys,'' Mr. Derringer says. ''The McCoys.'' Encouraged, the forgetful fan goes on. ''You had that hit song . . . 'Sally' . . . um . . . 'Soupy' . . .''</p>
        <p>'' 'Hang On Sloopy,, '' volunteers Mr. Derringer, who is a guitarist. ''Yeah, that's it,'' the fan says. Then, attempting a graceful as well as a knowledgeable departure, he offers one final fact: ''Hey, I hear you're touring with Patty Smyth now.'' ''Cyndi Lauper,'' Mr. Derringer corrects.  ''Well, take care,'' the young man mumbles over his shoulder. ''I'm a big fan of yours.''  APPROACH TO PURE REASON  April activates ants.  Suddenly ants  swarm over thresholds,  dart through cracks,  measure my plates  for honey prints,  my cupboards for sugar,  discover blackberry jam.  All winter their ghosts  disguised as pale flour moths  hovered over counter  and stove and pot.  Now the real Things,  not Idea,  run, dance and climb  over every surface of life.

        <p>$50 REWARD  THREE LEGS BLIND IN LEFT EYE  RIGHT EAR MISSING BROKEN TAIL  ANSWERS TO THE NAME ''LUCKY''  Department of Lively Luncheons: The following item -found, clipped and passed on to Metropolitan Diary by Marilyn Krinzman of Middletown, N.J. - appeared in the April issue of The Lincroft Village News.  THE NAVESINK GARDEN CLUB  HAS C. ANTHONY TODESCO  AS GUEST SPEAKER  The Navesink Garden Club will present Mr. C.Anthony Todesco, noted floral designer, in a special luncheon and lecture program on Tuesday April 7 at the Trinity Episcopal Church Parish Hall, White Street, in Red Bank. The luncheon will be gin at noon, followed by Mr. Todesco's program:</p>
        <p>''Spring Flowers, Fun and Fantasy.''  Two stories, one from a New Yorker who recently took a trip out west; the other from a Californian visiting Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The New Yorker is Alma Denny. She is in an annoyingly long and noisy line at the Ansonia Station post office on the Upper West Side. To ease the wait, Ms. Denny is recalling another line - this one leisurely, polite and down to earth - in a Puget Sound post office in Washington. A young woman and her two children, a boy and a girl, had been in front of Ms. Denny in that line. The sole postal clerk did her work swiftly. When the woman and her children reached the counter, she purchased a book of stamps. Then she bent down, reached for her youngest child, lifted him from his stroller and handed him to the postal clerk. This appeared to be a regular procedure: with a knowing nod, the clerk took the youngster and gently placed him on the postal scale.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-two pounds!'' she announced. ''Doing fine, isn't he?'' Then the clerk leaned over the counter and addressed the little girl. ''Would you like a stamp?'' she asked softly. The youngster nodded. ''Put out your hand, then,'' the clerk instructed. With that she reached into a drawer, took out a rubber stamp with a clown's face on it and stamped the girl's hand.</p>
        <p>By then, everyone in the line seemed to have a clown's smile on his face.</p>
        <p>The Californian is Jane Bers, visiting New York from Pleasant Hill, a suburb of San Francisco. She is having a light midafternoon repast at one of the Upper West Side's more precious cafes. In walks a well-dressed woman pushing a stroller in which her son, perhaps 3 years old, sits sullenly. Mom takes a table. A waiter is soon at her side. ''What would you like?'' he asks.  Without hesitating, she orders a double espresso and a strawberry-rhubarb muffin. ''And the young man?'' the waiter inquires. The boy looks up. He doesn't hesitate, either. ''I want a cappuccino,'' he says. Ms. Bers is impressed.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry, but we don't have cappuccino,'' the waiter tells him.</p>
        <p>The youngster frowns. He tugs at his mother's sleeve. ''Let's get out of here!'' he says.</p>
