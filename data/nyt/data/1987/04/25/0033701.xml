        <p>LEAD: Interest rates resumed their rise yesterday as dealers marked down prices of all Treasury maturities in what proved to a largely futile effort to attract investors.</p>
        <p>Interest rates resumed their rise yesterday as dealers marked down prices of all Treasury maturities in what proved to a largely futile effort to attract investors.</p>
        <p>Dealers said the bond market was so demoralized that many of them abandoned their usual pre-weekend practice of buying securities to offset inventories they previously sold short as a hedge against price declines.</p>
        <p>The bellwether long Treasury bond, the 7 1/2 percent issue of 2016, was offered late in the session at 87 14/32, down 1 24/32, to yield 8.69 percent. At the close of the holiday-shortened previous week, the long bond had been offered at 92 7/32, to yield 8.20 percent.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, the spot June Treasury bond futures plunged 1 28/32, to 89 10/ 32, down sharply from 94 7/32 at the close of the previous week.</p>
        <p>Because of the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is allowing short-term rates to inch up, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills soared 32 basis points, to 5.81 percent. The six-month issue rose 19 basis points, to 6.01 percent, and the rate on the one-year bills gained 16 basis points, to 6.41 percent. A week ago, the rate on the 90-day bills had been 5.60 percent The Fed can only control short-term rates, and the belief that the Fed was ''snugging'' those rates, or firming them just a bit, gained credence after the central bank took no action yesterday to reduce the rates by adding reserves directly or indirectly to the banking system. Partly as a result, the basic lending rate, the cost of overnight loans, held steady at 6.25 percent. 'More of the Same'</p>
        <p>''It was more of the same today,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ''and I don't know how much more of it we can take. Unless policies are implemented quickly to halt the slide in the dollar, which is the pivotal factor in the bond market today, we could see the long bond yielding 9 percent next week, which would really fuel inflationary expectations.''</p>
        <p>The bond market was unnerved from the opening because the dollar had fallen below the psychological floor of 140 yen in Tokyo earlier. ''And the market's gloom deepened,'' Mr. Sullivan said, ''when precious metals prices began to climb and did not pause for the usual pre-weekend hedge selling or profit taking.''</p>
        <p>Another factor unsettling the bond market was mounting concern about the outcome of the Treasury's next mid-quarter refunding. The terms are to be announced this Wednesday and the auctions of 3-, 10- and 30-year bonds are set for May 4, 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>The focus of concern is the degree of participation by Japanese investors, in light of the heightening trade frictions between Washington and Tokyo. Japanese investors have long been important participants in Treasury auctions.</p>
        <p>In late trading yesterday, the outstanding three-year notes, the 6 3/4's of 1991, dropped 18/32, to 94 3/32, to yield 7.92 percent. The current key long notes, the 7 1/4's of 1996, plunged 28/32, to 92 6/32, for a yield of 8.69 percent.</p>
