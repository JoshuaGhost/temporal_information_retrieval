        <p>LEAD: Stress comes from many sources: tight travel schedules, competitive sports and even elementary school, say participants in a new stress management course for children 5 to 12 years old.</p>
        <p>Stress comes from many sources: tight travel schedules, competitive sports and even elementary school, say participants in a new stress management course for children 5 to 12 years old.</p>
        <p>''One night I was going to Florida and I was so nervous I could hardly get on the plane,'' said 7-year-old Andrew Doyle.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey York, 9, remarked, ''I feel stress at breakfast when I expect bacon and eggs but get cold cereal or when it's 11:30 at night and I can't fall asleep.''</p>
        <p>Julia Dyson, 10, said: ''I feel it when I'm riding in a horse show or have to speak in public. It makes me miserable. It's my brain saying, 'You can't do that.' '' 'Puberty and Stuff'</p>
        <p>Matthew Boynton, 12, added, ''I had stress when I stayed back a grade without knowing why. Also, puberty and stuff will cause stress because I don't know what will happen to me.''</p>
        <p>These are among the first graduates of ''Funtastics,'' a four-week stress management course for children that was held by Emerson Hospital in this suburb west of Boston.</p>
        <p>Experts in child psychiatry say courses like this are relatively new. Dr. David Van Buskirk, director of Child Psychiatry at the Cambridge Hospital of Harvard Medical School, said: ''With few exceptions, parents and schools tend to ignore stress in children. But pioneers in the field are now looking at stress management for them since relaxation techniques and self-hypnosis have been useful for many adolescents and adults.''</p>
        <p>''Much childhood stress,'' he said, ''stems from family disintegration, loss of a loved one, moving, if a parent loses a job or their health and from the competition of the educational process.'' Learning About Peer Pressure</p>
        <p>At ''Funtastics,'' there were as many definitions of stress as there were participants. Ten children 5 to 7 years old, each accompanied by a parent, were in one group; in another group were 14 children 8 to 12 years old.</p>
        <p>''For kids,'' said 9-year-old Seth Avakian, ''stress is peer pressure, which I learned about when my friends told me to jump off the tunnel.'' He motioned to a cast on the foot he broke when he jumped.</p>
        <p>''I came here so I could get out without Amanda,'' Rebecca H. Garfield, 5, said, referring to her 9-month-old sister. ''Stress is listening to her scream or when Mommy and Daddy don't pay attention to me.''</p>
        <p>The hospital offers other courses and programs, and Rebecca and her mother learned about this one after attending a course on ''Sibling Preparation,'' for children who are about to get a newborn brother or sister.</p>
        <p>The idea for the stress course came from Eleanor R. White, the hospital's director of community services. Ms. White said that last fall she was taking the hospital's adult stress management course and ''I overheard young mothers talking about their children's tensions.'' Noncompetitive</p>
        <p>Games The techniques used, including aerobic exercise and noncompetitive games, seek ''to reduce tension and show children they can control their bodies and minds,'' said John M. Yaeger, a child psychologist who led the course.</p>
        <p>Through aerobics - hopping, jumping, jogging - and measuring their pulse, children realize they can slow or speed the heartbeat. They learn to associate a rapid pulse with tension and a slower one with serenity and fun.</p>
        <p>Noncompetitive games, such as grabbing onto the edge of a big parachute and making waves, reinforce the value of cooperation. ''No one wins but it gives them a chance to laugh and be childlike in an era when kids grow up fast,'' Mr. Yaeger explained.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, ''we use simple relaxation techniques.'' Deep breathing is one or, he said, ''we ask them to make a grouchy face or fist or foot then transform it into a light balloon so they know how it feels to be tense then relaxed.'' Blue Ribbon Replaces Worrying</p>
        <p>Another lesson involves pretending. With the lights dimmed and with sounds of harps and chirping birds played in the background, children pretend they are at the beach or in the woods, with no worries, and listen as Mr. Yaeger guides them: ''Breathe in energy, breathe out stress and let the tension drain away.''</p>
        <p>Through it all, he said, ''We show them they are in control and it can be fun to take care of themselves.''</p>
        <p>Ms. White said the hospital would schedule another course after surveying parents and children for reactions and suggestions.</p>
        <p>Julia Dyson, for one, gives the course high marks. ''Last week, I did a horseback-riding demonstration,'' she said. ''Instead of worrying, I thought about other things and breathed. I got a blue ribbon and an invitation to the county competition.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey York's mother, Heather, said she had enrolled her son because ''he is a highly gifted child but he clashes with the real world because he has his own ideas about how things should be done.'' She said the class, which cost $60, had helped him learn how to relax.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey himself said he would use what he had learned ''to stop getting mad at my little brother, who I like but he argues a lot.''</p>
