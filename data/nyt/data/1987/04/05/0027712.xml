        <p>LEAD: With convocations, proclamations and perorations, Columbia College is celebrating its bicentennial this month - the biggest party since 1954 when, with convocations, proclamations and perorations, it also celebrated a bicentennial.</p>
        <p>With convocations, proclamations and perorations, Columbia College is celebrating its bicentennial this month - the biggest party since 1954 when, with convocations, proclamations and perorations, it also celebrated a bicentennial.</p>
        <p>While 200th birthdays 33 years apart may sound like the mathematical manipulations of eager college public relations officials, Columbia indeed had a 200th birthday in 1954 and can rightfully claim one again now.</p>
        <p>The college was founded as King's College in 1754. It was closed during the Revolutionary War and in 1784 was renamed Columbia College. On April 13, 1787, a new charter was granted by the State of New York - thanks mostly to the efforts and diplomacy of Alexander Hamilton, an alumnus of King's College - and Columbia College was established as an independent institution under the private control of its own trustees, Hamilton among them.</p>
        <p>It is the bicentennial of that charter that Columbia is now observing. Festivities are to begin Friday with a celebration stretching much of the length of Manhattan. At 10 A.M. hundreds of Columbia students, faculty members, administrators, alumni and assorted supporters are to board a special subway train at 116th Street and ride nonstop to Lower Manhattan. 'Roar, Lion, Roar'</p>
        <p>A parade led by the Columbia marching and concert bands playing ''Roar, Lion, Roar'' and other appropriate tunes, will march down lower Broadway, past Trinity Church, the birthplace of King's College, to Federal Hall. There Mayor Koch will read a proclamation and speeches will be given by Michael I. Sovern, president of the university; Robert E. Pollack, dean of the college, and Henry F. Graff, a professor of history.</p>
        <p>A reception and luncheon will follow inside Federal Hall while the Columbia Dixieland band plays on the steps.</p>
        <p>Beginning Friday afternoon and continuing through Sunday there will be celebrations on campus. On Friday night a bicentennial ball will be held at the college.</p>
        <p>Sunday at 8 P.M. there will be a celebration at the Metropolitan Opera House, with Walter Cronkite as the host.</p>
        <p>The evening will also include excerpts from motion pictures filmed at Columbia and a number of performers, including the New York Oratorio Society, which performed at the Columbia centennial celebration.</p>
        <p>On April 13, the actual anniversary of the signing of the charter, a formal academic procession, readings and an oration will take place at 10:30 A.M. in St. Paul's Chapel on the campus.</p>
