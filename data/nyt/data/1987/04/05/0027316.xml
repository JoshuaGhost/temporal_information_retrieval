        <p>Your article on trauma centers was in general highly informative; however, certain facts require clarification. Residents of southern Westchester may be under the impression that most of the Westchester medical facilities are located in one hospital. This is not so; all the hospitals in this area have equal total-trauma-care-facilities designations.</p>
        <p>It should also be pointed out, particularly to the residents of Yonkers, that they are served by four hospitals with total-trauma-care designations and are part of one of the busiest Advanced Life Support prehospital systems in the state.  ELIOT J. SMITH, M.D.</p>
