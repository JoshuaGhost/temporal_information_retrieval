        <p>LEAD: Eloise Laino says she is delighted to exchange the colorful stripes and gingerbread man she painted on her house in a historic district for ordinary gray vinyl siding.</p>
        <p>Eloise Laino says she is delighted to exchange the colorful stripes and gingerbread man she painted on her house in a historic district for ordinary gray vinyl siding.</p>
        <p>Miss Laino, an X-ray technician, declared victory over the Springfield Historical Commission and called in the siding company after the commission did not contest her second application for the modern siding. She filed the application quietly in September.</p>
        <p>The siding work on Miss Laino's house is nearly complete. The commission, which has jurisdiction over exterior improvements in the city's six historic districts, could issue a stop-work order and then seek an injunction. But in this case it has taken no action, pending a written opinion on its legal position from City Solicitor Richard Egan. 'It Looks a Lot Better'</p>
        <p>Miss Laino's first application was unanimously rejected by the commission last May as not in keeping with the neighborhood's historic character. That prompted her to paint her two-family Victorian house purple and orange in protest. Paint of any color was permissible.</p>
        <p>''It looks a lot better,'' Miss Laino said of the siding. ''But the gingerbread man was kind of cute.''</p>
        <p>The historical commission is not happy. ''She did not get our permission to do this,'' said the commission chairwoman, Frances Gagnon. She said it was the first time in its 15 years that the commission had been ''blatantly disobeyed.''</p>
        <p>''We are extremely frustrated,'' she said. Law May Be on Her Side</p>
        <p>But she said she has been advised by city lawyers that the law might be on Miss Laino's side.</p>
        <p>In September, Miss Laino resubmitted her request for vinyl siding to the commission. Mrs. Gagnon said the group decided not to consider it because, ''Unless a new application is substantially different from the first one, it cannot be heard over and over again with the hope that the vote will change.''</p>
        <p>But the new application was taken over the counter at the commission office in City Hall and, Miss Laino contends, was therefore officially under consideration and automatically approved when the commission took no action in an ensuing 60-day period required under state law.</p>
        <p>''They say they never accepted my application, but if they took it over the counter, they accepted it,'' Miss Laino said. ''I complied with the law. They never got back to me.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gagnon said the slip-up occurred in a period when the commission staff was in transition and the file system was in disarray.</p>
