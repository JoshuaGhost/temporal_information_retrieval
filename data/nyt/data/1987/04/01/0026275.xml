        <p>The idea, which has surfaced before at this time of year, is to take advantage of the interest in the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament by creating an invitational playoff for four to eight national high school powers the week after the Final Four. There has been no national high school basketball championship since a tourney sponsored by the University of Chicago lapsed more than half a century ago, but that, of course, was in the pre-television age.</p>
        <p>Given the college playoffs' ever-growing popularity, their huge television audience and the many millions of dollars they generate, the support that coaches and television officials are giving to a schoolboy version is no surprise. ''Our sales and marketing guys love it,'' said Len DeLuca, a CBS Sports programming executive. He said the network was exploring the ''interesting concept,'' in which the preliminary games would be carried on a cable hookup, with the final televised by CBS.</p>
        <p>The moving force behind the proposal is Billy Packer, the CBS basketball analyst, who has been shopping it among high school coaches and athletic overseers, so far with distinctly mixed success. Packer has enlisted the support of Carey McDonald, executive director of the 55,000-member National High School Athletic Coaches Association, but only after failing to make any headway with the National Federation of State High School Associations. The federation, which governs high school athletics and would have final say on any such playoffs, has consistently opposed national prep championships and is unlikely to change its stance.</p>
        <p>''There is a strong feeling,'' said Brice Durbin, the federation's executive director, ''that state championships are about the right level for high school athletes,'' a view that has also been expressed by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. Top prep athletes, Durbin says, have plenty of opportunity for national recognition - in college.</p>
