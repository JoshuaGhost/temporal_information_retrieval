        <p>LEAD: LONZELL HILL remembered when his father played pro football, and he was entranced. Scott Schwedes was not born when his father briefly played pro football, but when he saw his first game he was entranced, too.</p>
        <p>LONZELL HILL remembered when his father played pro football, and he was entranced. Scott Schwedes was not born when his father briefly played pro football, but when he saw his first game he was entranced, too.</p>
        <p>Both youngsters went on to become outstanding college wide receivers, Hill at Washington and Schwedes at Syracuse. Both are expected to be high choices in tomorrow's National Football League draft, and both are potential choices of the Giants, who want a fast wide receiver.</p>
        <p>There is more to Hill's story. His father, J. D. Hill, was a Pro Bowl receiver who played for the Buffalo Bills (1971-75) and the Detroit Lions (1976-77). He had difficulty making the transition to life without football, and he turned to cocaine. 'Identity Crisis'</p>
        <p>''It was an immediate identity crisis,'' said the elder Hill. ''I wasn't prepared for a new life style. I was my son's idol, and I faltered, went haywire. I could have damaged him and the rest of the family badly. Thank God, I didn't lose his total respect, and what I did lose I think I've gotten back.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing of all was to call him and tell him I was in rehabilitation. His response was that he loved me and would do whatever he could to help me get better.''</p>
        <p>When J. D. Hill started with cocaine, Lonzell was a high school junior. The cocaine period lasted from 1980 to 1985.</p>
        <p>''I thought something was wrong,'' said the son, ''but I didn't want to believe my dad was on drugs. It didn't sink in until he told me himself.''</p>
        <p>Now father and son give antidrug lectures together. The father is a vice president of a California management company and is establishing the company's drug-rehabilitation program.</p>
        <p>Lonzell Hill is 5 feet 10 3/4 inches and 182 pounds. He has run 40 yards, the standard football measuring distance, in 4.50 seconds, which is fast. He has a reputation as a tough player who is especially elusive in the open field.</p>
        <p>Scott Schwedes is slim and quick -5-11 1/2 and 170 pounds, with 4.45 speed. He is a big-play receiver with good hands, and he also returns punts and kickoffs. How good is the son? ''You're asking his father,'' said Gerhard Schwedes. ''But if you really want to know, I think he's the best receiver in the country going into the draft. He's also a nice kid.'' Captain of Championship Team</p>
        <p>Gerhard Schwedes was a running back and captain of Syracuse's 1959 national champions. He was the first draft choice of the Boston Patriots of the American Football League, but injuries ended his career after one year. He now lives in upstate New York and owns a company specializing in motivation.</p>
        <p>''He took me to Syracuse games when I was 6,'' said Scott. ''I remember a Syracuse-Maryland game and how exciting it was, how much energy was in the air, how much people loved football.''</p>
        <p>At first, said the son, it was difficult living up to his father's reputation.</p>
        <p>''But not lately,'' he said with a laugh. ''Instead of saying I'm the son of Gerhard Schwedes, now people say he's the father of Scott Schwedes.''</p>
        <p>The son has been trying to concentrate on graduation May 10, when he will receive a degree in marketing. But for the last three or four weeks he has been worked out almost daily by N.F.L. scouts, including Jerry Angelo of the Giants two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''I've been kind of nervous about the draft,'' said Scott. ''I haven't been able to sleep at night. I'm nervous because I don't know where I'm going to live the next three or four years.''</p>
        <p>''The next 10 years,'' his father interjected.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea where I'll be drafted and no idea who will draft me,'' said Scott. Did he have preferences? ''I hope a couple of teams I prefer draft me,'' he said, ''but I'm not going to tell you which.'' A good guess would be the Giants. ''I'm a Giants fan,'' he said. ''I've been following them since I was 11 or 12. I went bananas when they won the Super Bowl.''</p>
