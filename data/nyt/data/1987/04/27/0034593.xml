        <p>The sanctuary is a dirt floor rodeo arena next to Sombrero's Cantina and Taco Bar in what is billed as the world's largest honky-tonk. The minister raises money for his flock by competing in the annual Open Ropin' calf roping event. When the congregation passes the hat, it is a Resistol cowboy hat from the Mad Hatter in Granbury, Tex.</p>
        <p>The PTL Club it is not, but no one seems to be complaining at the Cowboy Church, a blend of rodeo ambiance and evangelical Christianity that has gained a loyal following here in the only big city in Texas that still takes cowboy culture seriously.</p>
        <p>''I like it 'cause you can just sit in the dirt, wear what you want, and just be you,'' said Wayne Lynch of Watauga, Tex., who showed up for Easter services in a black cowboy hat, snap-button western shirt, blue jeans and boots.</p>
        <p>The western ambiance is everywhere, from the Skoal chewing tobacco billboard that dominates the arena, to the western wear and rodeo metaphors of the Rev. Jeff Copenhaver to the Cowboy Church Buckaroo Club youth group. But Mr. Copenhaver, a former World Champion calf roper, said the unconventional atmosphere did not distract from the religious message. God Isn't Clothes Conscious</p>
        <p>''God doesn't wear a three-piece suit,'' said Mr. Copenhaver, who began the interdenominational church a year ago. ''God could care less how people dress. He looks on their heart, and we wanted to keep things natural and give people an alternative they didn't have before.''</p>
        <p>Despite its commercial surroundings at the cavernous Billy Bob's Texas honky-tonk, the Cowboy Church is an outgrowth of authentic religious feeling on the rodeo circuit. Organizations such as Cowboys for Christ and the Cowboy Chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes regularly give Sunday services in arenas on the rodeo circuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Copenhaver, whose father, Deb Copenhaver, was a world champion saddle bronco rider in 1955 and 1956, began preaching on the rodeo circuit around the time he quit full-time rodeo competition in 1979. After preaching at a national championship rodeo in Las Vegas, Nev., last year, he was invited to hold services at Billy Bob's for the cowboys competing at Fort Worth's annual Southwestern Exposition and Fat Stock Show.</p>
        <p>The original idea was for one service, but it was so well received that Mr. Copenhaver decided to preach again. His Cowboy Church is incorporated and has a board of directors but still has no membership list, deacons, elders, pews, vestments or other signs of traditional worship. Cowboys in Spirit</p>
        <p>For Sunday morning services, it draws from 125 to 200 people, many of them horse trainers, ranchers, part-time rodeo riders or others associated with the cattle business. Others are cowboys in spirit more than reality. Mr. Lynch describes himself as ''an old cowboy'' but now works in a warehouse for an aviation supply company.</p>
        <p>Most come for the fellowship, informal surroundings and the folksy preaching of Mr. Copenhaver, who has been known to punctuate sermons with cowboy whoops of rapture.</p>
        <p>At one point he referred to his past life as ''a full Pepsi bottle of selfishness,'' and he later extolled God's power by proclaiming: ''He's healing people today. He's providing their needs today. He's bringing in their house payments today. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's alive. He's cancelling traffic tickets today. Hallelujah, he's alive. Jesus is alive.''</p>
        <p>The church welcomes people with no connection to the rodeo world, but Mr. Copenhaver says it feels a special need to help those connected with it. For instance, when he meets the calf roper Joe Beaver in a competition this Sunday at Cowtown Coliseum, the profits will go to the church's Rodeo Emergency Fund to help rodeo cowboys and their families in need. Living Close to Nature</p>
        <p>Cowboys are not always viewed as being the souls of Christian piety, but Mr. Copenhaver said the rigors of rodeo competition and the pleasures of living close to nature help explain the mixture of religion and rodeo.</p>
        <p>''The Book of Romans says that all creation points out the fact that there is a God,'' he said. ''And maybe the more you get out of the city situation, the more you can see creation.</p>
        <p>''I'd say too there's a lot of traveling around that rodeo people do, and a lot of car wrecks or close calls you hear about. And with all the times they get thrown from a horse or a bull and have a foot miss them by two inches or sometimes not miss them at all and still come out breathing, they figure God has to be watching over them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Copenhaver said the time may come when the dusty arena at Billy Bob's will no longer be an appropriate sanctuary, and he is already considering the possibility of a move to more appropriate quarters for worship.</p>
        <p>''If we outgrow where we are we might move over to the Cowtown Coliseum. It's a lot larger,'' the minister said.</p>
