        <p>LEAD: Three days of protests against Reagan Administration policies in Central America and South Africa ended today with the arrest of hundreds of demonstrators who sat down in front of entrances to the Central Intelligence Agency in the morning rush hour.</p>
        <p>Three days of protests against Reagan Administration policies in Central America and South Africa ended today with the arrest of hundreds of demonstrators who sat down in front of entrances to the Central Intelligence Agency in the morning rush hour.</p>
        <p>Fairfax County, Va., police officers, with jurisdiction over the south gate of the C.I.A. facility, arrested 355 protesters. Some of the demonstrators went limp and were dragged into police vans. Others walked. United States Park police, with jurisdiction over the north gate, arrested 183 protesters, while the Federal Protective Service arrested 19.</p>
        <p>C.I.A. officials said they believed that the protest was the largest held outside the agency, which is nestled near a forest of pines and poplars in suburban Virginia. The relatively unviolent demonstration included teen-agers in ''punk'' haircuts, grandmothers, priests, college students and activists of the 1960's and 1970's. Ellsberg Recalls Other Protests</p>
        <p>''Reminds me of the 70's,'' said Daniel Ellsberg, the former Government official who made the Pentagon Papers public, moments before he sat down to cheers with dozens of protesters at the south gate. ''But people seem older now, more middle-aged. And they don't seem to see the police as enemies.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, the Rev. Joseph Nangle, a Catholic priest who spent years in Chile and Peru, glanced around and said, ''It's kind of a 60's crowd. That's not bad. We stopped the Vietnam War that way.''</p>
        <p>Bill Coulter, public information officer for the Fairfax police, said those arrested would be charged with ''obstructing the free passage of others,'' which carries a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and a year in jail. Many protesters were either released after receiving a summons at the scene or following an appearance before a local magistrate.</p>
        <p>''I would describe the atmosphere as almost carnival-like,'' said Mr. Coulter. ''No problem whatsoever.'' Although the protesters succeeded in closing the main, or south, gate for at least four hours, agency officials insisted that the bulk of the employees were working. Many employees arrived before dawn, thus missing the demonstrators. ''It's pretty well business as usual,'' said Kathy Pherson, a C.I.A. spokeswoman. Carter and Hoffman Missed</p>
        <p>Among those arrested were Mr. Ellsberg and Philip Berrigan, the antiwar protester. Many demonstrators were disappointed that Amy Carter, former President Jimmy Carter's daughter, and Abbie Hoffman, were not among them.</p>
        <p>''I think she has school obligations,'' said Leslie Cagan, national coordinator of the protest, called ''the National Mobilization for Justice and Peace in Central America and Southern Africa.'' Miss Carter is a 19-year-old-sophomore at Brown University.</p>
        <p>Some C.I.A. employees arriving for work walked impassively past the demonstrators, many of whom shouted ''Join us!'' or ''Murderers! Murderers! Guilty!'' Several bystanders who opposed the demonstators were heckled but left alone.</p>
        <p>George Hanks, a retired mechanical engineer from nearby McLean, Va., carried a sign reading: ''Go Home Amy - You Too Abby.''</p>
        <p>''I heard about this on the 11 o'clock news last night and just decided to come down,'' he said. ''I have no great affection for the C.I.A., but I don't particularly care much for people who think that everything the United States does outside the country is wrong.'' U.S. Policies Protested</p>
        <p>Nearby, demonstrators chanted, ''The whole world is watching,'' and one held up a picture of a child in Central America whose legs were missing. The placard was scrawled with the words, ''A Small C.I.A. Crime.'' Many of the demonstrators carried signs with names of Nicaraguans, Salvadorans or black South Africans who are missing, imprisoned or dead. Noisy endorsement of the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua marked the protest.</p>
        <p>''Si, si, Sandinistas, no, no, C.I.A.,'' the demonstrators shouted. Several began shouting at two youths, carrying American flags and a photograph of President Reagan.</p>
        <p>''The contras are freedom fighters!'' one of the youths, Karl Strohminger, a student at Towson State University in Maryland, exclaimed to several demonstrators.</p>
        <p>A protester responded furiously: ''The Sandinistas are opening up schools and hospitals. The C.I.A. are murderers.''</p>
        <p>In the absence of Miss Carter, Mr. Ellsberg was plainly the star protester of the event, treated with the respect accorded elder statesmen.</p>
