        <p>MARKETS  The dollar rebounded in hectic North American trading, after being pummeled in Asian and European dealings. The currency was lifted by supportive comments from President Reagan and a collapse in precious metals that eased fears of inflation. Some analysts predicted near-term stability for the dollar, although many remain bearish for the longer haul. In New York, gold fell $17.50, to $445 an ounce.  [ Page D1. ]  The precious metals markets had their wildest day in years. Silver was especially volatile, swinging from a high of $11.25 to a low of $7.20, before ending at $7.80. [ D1. ] The stock market ended lower despite a valiant effort to rebound. After being down 42 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average wound up losing 4.83 points, at 2,230.54. Trading was enlivened by mining issues, which swung wildly and ended sharply lower.  [ D14. ]  ''Short interest'' on Nasdaq stocks rose 6.1 percent, to 197.9 million shares, for the month ended April 15. [ D30. ] Bond prices staged a dramatic comeback after plunging in earlier trading. The Fed had been expected to inject reserves into the banking system to drive down the Federal funds rate. But rates rose after the Fed did not act, which traders took as a positive sign because it would help the dollar and make Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors. [ D25. ] THE ECONOMY  A study finds that the world economy would be helped little by the policies of Treasury Secretary Baker and those of Japan and West Germany, according to officials familiar with the research. In effect, the work concludes that the international coordination that Secretary Baker has sponsored - as a means to resolving currency turbulence, trade imbalances, uneven growth and third world debt - will not produce the 3 percent growth with low inflation that the major nations say is needed for global prosperity. [ D1. ] President Reagan assailed a trade bill amendment offered by Representative Gephardt as a ''dangerous'' proposal. He said the provision, which would require retaliation against nations with large surpluses, could disrupt the world trading system and jeopardize relations with some major trading partners. [ D8. ] An auction of mortgages on low-cost housing was called off by the Administration. An official warned that the sale could lead to displacing low-income families from their homes. [ A1. ] COMPANIES  Lotus signed a 10-year agreement with I.B.M. to design software for the computer company's largest models, starting with a version of Lotus 1-2-3 for the System/370 mainframes. The move is critical to Lotus in its battle with Microsoft, the maker of the operating system for I.B.M. PC's. The new alliance might have a devastating effect on Ashton-Tate, the No. 3 software maker. [ D1. ] Texaco's activities will be monitored by 26 of its creditors, including Pennzoil. The creditors, which were appointed to two committees by a Federal trustee, will also work on a plan of reorganization for the oil company. [ D1. ] GAF withdrew its hostile offer for Borg-Warner, deciding not to top the $4.23 billion bid by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners. GAF expects a pretax profit of more than $190 million on its Borg stock. It also plans to buy back up to three million of its own shares. [ D1. ] Chrysler expects a final accord to acquire American Motors in the next 10 days. The auto maker, which also reported a 24.4 percent drop in first-quarter income because of marketing and retooling costs, disclosed several cost-cutting moves. It also said that it would expand production at the recently acquired Lamborghini. [ D2. ] Goodyear Tire and Rubber posted a first-quarter profit of $284.2 million, compared with a loss of $212.7 million a year earlier. The nation's largest tire company attributed the improvement mainly to the sale of several non-tire businesses. [ D2. ] Burlington Industries was accused of taking illegal steps to manipulate its stock price in order to thwart a takeover bid from Dominion Textile and Asher B. Edelman. [ D5. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS  The dollar's downward march will - and should - continue, argues Paul R. Krugman, an economist at M.I.T. He predicts that the currency will fall another 20 percent. Talking Business. [ D2. ] The recent buffeting of newspaper stocks has divided analysts. Some cite Florida's 5 percent sales tax on media, while others point to the market's overall drop and other factors. Market Place. [ D14. ]</p>
