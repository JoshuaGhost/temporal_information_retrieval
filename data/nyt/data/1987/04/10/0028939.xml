        <p>LEAD: Bess Myerson, accused in a specially commissioned mayoral report of ''serious misconduct,'' resigned yesterday as Mayor Koch's Cultural Affairs Commissioner.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Bess Myerson, accused in a specially commissioned mayoral report of ''serious misconduct,'' resigned yesterday as Mayor Koch's Cultural Affairs Commissioner.</p>
        <p>Bess Myerson, accused in a specially commissioned mayoral report of ''serious misconduct,'' resigned yesterday as Mayor Koch's Cultural Affairs Commissioner.</p>
        <p>The Mayor accepted his friend's resignation publicly, at a strained, unusually crowded news conference in which the normally expressive Mayor spoke in terse sentences about the latest member of his administration to fall victim to various aspects of the New York City corruption scandals.</p>
        <p>He said he was distressed, called Ms. Myerson's departure ''very painful,'' repeatedly answered long, pointed questions with three or four words and frequently declined to elaborate on his answers. A Continuing Investigation</p>
        <p>The reason that the Mayor cited was official secrecy. The report on Ms. Myerson, which was begun after she took an unpaid leave of absence three months ago, was not released and will not be, based on a recommendation of the former Federal judge who prepared it at the Mayor's request, Harold R. Tyler Jr. Mr. Tyler said public release of the report could damage a continuing investigation by the United States Attorney in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It appeared evident, too, that this news conference was different from the others the Mayor had held to announce resignations, exercises so familiar in the last 15 months that they had almost become routine. In the past, he had at times been harshly critical of those accused of wrongdoing, charging former associates with ''betraying'' him, sometimes before they were indicted, much less found guilty.</p>
        <p>In the case of Ms. Myerson, who became publicly if not permanently linked with Mr. Koch when she served as a constant and beneficial presence during his 1977 mayoral campaign, he declined to criticize her. Despite Mr. Tyler's findings that she misled the Mayor and took advantage of her office, Mr. Koch continued to praise her record in the Cultural Affairs Department, echoing his judgment three months ago that she was a ''superb'' commissioner. 'Two Obligations'</p>
        <p>Over and over again, Mr. Koch indicated yesterday that he accepted Ms. Myerson's resignation because it was his duty to do so. ''A mayor has two obligations,'' he said. ''One is that of being mayor; the other is normal human responses to people. When the two come into conflict, it's your mayoral obligations that have to predominate.''</p>
        <p>The Federal investigation that led Mr. Tyler to bar public release of the report centers on Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges in January. Mr. Capasso, a major construction contractor for the city whose contracts are being investigated by the United States Attorney's office, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $500,000 last week.</p>
        <p>Citing the legal constraints, which he did not challenge publicly, the Mayor released only a five-sentence summary of the former judge's report. It accused Ms. Myerson of ''serious misconduct'' in connection with her decision to give a job in her agency to Sukhreet Gabel, daughter of the State Supreme Court justice who was handling Mr. Capasso's divorce, Hortense W. Gabel. Failure to Report Gifts</p>
        <p>The report summary also faults the explanation that Ms. Myerson gave to the Mayor in 1983 for hiring Ms. Gabel and says there were ''improprieties with respect to Commissioner Myerson's use of city employees for personal purposes and with respect to her failure to report gifts received from Carl Capasso.''</p>
        <p>It found no impropriety in her accepting the gifts. And it said no witness was found to provide ''substantial evidence to support any allegation of misconduct by Commissioner Myerson in connection with the awarding of contracts to Mr. Capasso.'' The summary states, though, that Mr. Tyler did not examine every city contract awarded to Mr. Capasso.</p>
        <p>It also disclosed that Ms. Myerson, who said in a statement when she began her unpaid leave of absence on Jan. 13 that ''I agree with the appropriateness of this procedure and expect to testify at this inquiry,'' later refused to speak with Mr. Tyler ''on a voluntary, non-immunized basis.''</p>
        <p>The 62-year-old Ms. Myerson did not make herself available for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer, Frederick P. Hafetz, issued a statement saying that ''although, in retrospect and with hindsight, Ms. Myerson believes that it was a mistake of judgment to have hired Judge Gabel's daughter, Ms. Myerson did not intend to, and indeed did not, do any wrongful acts.''</p>
        <p>''Ms. Myerson further is confident,'' Mr. Hafetz said, ''that the grand jury will conclude that there was no wrongdoing on her part.'' Fifth Amendment Invoked</p>
        <p>The former commissioner prompted the Tyler investigation herself, when it became known early this year that she had invoked her Fifth Amendment rights before a Federal grand jury investigating Mr. Capasso and had not told Mr. Koch about it. The Mayor learned that she had refused to testify, which he once considered a dismissable offense, from a television news report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch has refrained from saying anything critical about Ms. Myerson for months. Last spring, when the first news articles appeared, raising questions about her relationship with Mr. Capasso, the Mayor accused reporters of ''McCarthyism.''</p>
        <p>When he learned that Ms. Myerson had invoked the Fifth Amendment, he said little more than that he was distressed, and praised her. ''I have confidence in Bess Myerson's integrity,'' he said the day she started her leave of absence. ''I think she has done an outstanding job as Cultural Affairs Commissioner.''</p>
        <p>The Mayor's subdued demeanor yesterday suggested that Ms. Myerson's resignation was, in many ways, the most embarrassing of the many problems he has confronted since his third term began, even more so than the departure of Victor E. Botnick, the former chairman of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation who left the post in July after admitting that he lied about having a college degree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botnick was a key adviser to the Mayor, in reality playing a more important role in the day-to-day functioning of the Koch administration than Ms. Myerson ever did. But he was not a public figure. Not a Close Adviser</p>
        <p>Ms. Myerson is. She was not a close adviser to the Mayor, was not an insider or a member of his ''kitchen cabinet'' and has not been for at least a decade. The Cultural Affairs Department is not a major city agency, accounting for only about three-tenths of 1 percent of the city's annual expense budget. And her former job, which pays $83,000 a year, is not considered an important one in city government.</p>
        <p>But in large part because of the impression Mr. Koch worked so hard to create when he turned Ms. Myerson's popularity to his benefit 10 years ago, the two of them are closely associated in the public's mind and her fall has got to hurt him with the electorate.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday why he would not say anything critical about his departing commissioner, when the former judge's findings indicated bad judgment at best, and why the Mayor considered their personal friendship undiminished, Mr. Koch said at one point, ''Well, I guess it all depends on whether you know the meaning of friendship.'' He then abruptly turned his head away from his questioner. Introduced Koch to Garth</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch and his future commissioner met more than 20 years ago, when he was in the City Council and she was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner for Mayor John V. Lindsay. Then, in the months leading up to the 1977 campaign, Ms. Myerson introduced Mr. Koch, to David Garth, now his political consultant.</p>
        <p>In the campaign, the former Miss America, who was then better known than he was, gave her friend some much needed credibility and entree, and, through the strategy of acting as his constant companion, defused the inevitable speculation about the unmarried candidate.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Mayor said that the friendship continued once he was elected but that it was never as close as they made the public believe - which, ironically, is one reason her resignation may be more of a political blow to Mr. Koch than the departure of some others who have had to leave his government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch said he has not met recently with Ms. Myerson. She telephoned him at Gracie Mansion Wednesday night to resign, he explained, and they spoke just a few moments. He did not ask for her resignation, the Mayor said, because she volunteered it. Unanswered Questions</p>
        <p>Because the report has not been released, many questions remain unanswered, among them being for what ''personal purposes,'' Ms. Myerson used city employees and what gifts she accepted from Mr. Capasso, who heads the Nanco Construction Corporation.</p>
        <p>Another puzzling aspect of the case is that it has been public knowledge since 1983 that Ms. Myerson gave a $21,000-a-year job to Justice Gabel's daughter and that subsequently the judge cut by more than half the amount of alimony Mr. Capasso paid to his former wife, Nancy Capasso.</p>
        <p>Sukhreet Gabel was hired on Aug. 29, 1983, and the public record shows that Justice Gabel decreased the alimony payments the next month. In a memorandum that Ms. Myerson wrote to the Mayor on Oct. 19, 1983, she said that she hired Sukhreet Gabel on the merits, that most of the decisions in the divorce case had already been made and that ''a major part'' of them had been made ''in favor of Mrs. Capasso.'' She did not mention the cut in alimony payments. 'The Right Thing'</p>
        <p>In reply to that memo, Mr. Koch wrote to Ms. Myerson that by hiring Sukhreet Gabel, ''you did exactly the right thing in filling an open job with an able person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyler concluded that ''there was serious misconduct'' by Ms. Myerson with respect to hiring Sukhreet Gabel and in the Commissioner's explanation to the Mayor. Presumably, Mr. Tyler was alluding in part to aspects of that Oct. 19, 1983, memo, but that could not be determined yesterday.</p>
        <p>All copies that City Hall had of the Tyler report were returned to him, said Mr. Koch's press secretary, George Arzt. The Mayor said Mr. Tyler had sent copies to ''appropriate investigative authorities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hafetz said that as of last night neither he nor Ms. Myerson had seen the report.</p>
        <p>Asked repeatedly during his news conference if his restraint indicated he was protecting a friend, Mr. Koch said he was doing only what Mr. Tyler had asked.</p>
        <p>''I will not deviate from the request of Judge Tyler, which apparently has the support of the United States Attorney,'' the Mayor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch gave no indication yesterday of when he would select someone to replace Ms. Myerson. Diane Mulcahy Coffey, the Mayor's chief of staff, is now serving as Acting Commissioner of Cultural Affairs.</p>
