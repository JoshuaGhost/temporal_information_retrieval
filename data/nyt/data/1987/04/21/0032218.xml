        <p>LEAD: Birth rates are rising again in the world's most populous nation as China's monumental and controversial birth-control campaign loses its grip, Chinese officials and foreign experts agree.</p>
        <p>Birth rates are rising again in the world's most populous nation as China's monumental and controversial birth-control campaign loses its grip, Chinese officials and foreign experts agree.</p>
        <p>China's economic restructuring, with its emphasis on personal initiative, seems partly responsible. As peasants grow wealthier, they are often willing to pay the fines imposed for having more children than the Government rules allow.</p>
        <p>But a second reason is the taming of China's family planning program, following international criticism that it encouraged the killing of female infants in hopes of having sons, and placed pressure on women to abort fetuses even late in pregnancy. Population at 1.06 Billion</p>
        <p>Last year, the birth rate rose to about 20.8 for each 1,000 people, up from 17.8 in 1985. China ended 1986 with 14.8 million more inhabitants than it had a year earlier, bringing its population to 1.06 billion.</p>
        <p>For this nation, where swarms of bicycles convey people from one crowd to the next, where already tiny family farms are divided smaller and smaller with each generation, statistics showing a leap in the birth rate are taken very seriously. That has led to heightened concern among some diplomats and foreign experts about how China might respond.</p>
        <p>''The key question is: Does this mean there will be another crackdown?'' said Aprodicio A. Laquian, a Filipino who works with the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. A Harsh Crackdown</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the 80's, a vigorous crackdown slashed birthrates that by some projections might have resulted in a Chinese population of 5 billion or more in the next century.</p>
        <p>Yet the harshness of the approach, putting enormous pressure on women to have just one child, aroused indignation in the West and led the United States to cut off support for United Nations population programs, which play a role in China.</p>
        <p>''We regard the increase in birth rates as very significant,'' Shen Yimin, a senior population official in the State Statistics Bureau, said in an interview in an office jammed with printed exhortations to have fewer children. Target of 1.2 Billion People</p>
        <p>''It has aroused the attention of various ministries as well as delegates to the National People's Congress,'' he said. ''If current fertility rates continue, we will not meet our target of 1.2 billion people in the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shen predicted that there would be another crackdown, but he said it would focus on education and publicity campaigns rather than penalties. ''We cannot rely primarily on punishment anymore,'' he said. ''Now people don't mind paying for a second child.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-two percent of the world's people live here, on 7 percent of the world's arable land. The population density is four times America's and a little higher than France's - without taking into account the Gobi Desert and other areas that cannot be cultivated. Fertility Is Monitored</p>
        <p>China's leaders reacted to the population problem over the last decade with drastic measures. Volunteers monitor the fertility of nearly all women of child-bearing age, sometimes even tracking their menstrual cycles.</p>
        <p>Couples are given pay increases of 5 percent to 40 percent, plus long maternity leave and better housing, if they agree to have just one child. They are fined heavily, severely criticized by their peers and even risk losing their jobs if they violate the restrictions.</p>
        <p>Chinese women bear an average of 2.4 children, up from 2.2 in 1985. But population experts say the stress on limiting couples to just one child has always been somewhat misleading, except for urban residents.</p>
        <p>While couples in the cities must usually settle for one child, the rules are much more flexible for the nearly 80 percent of the population in rural areas. A rural couple that gives birth to a girl usually can get permission to try again for a boy. The strict curbs also do not apply to ethnic minorities. Criticism Eased Controls</p>
        <p>Sons still are prized more than daughters, because of tradition and the expectation that a son will be physically stronger and thus better able to look after aging parents.</p>
        <p>The family planning controls, while still rigorous, have been moderated somewhat in the last few years. A foreign expert here said the reason was international criticism.</p>
        <p>The rise in prosperity is also a factor. A Western diplomat who speaks Chinese overheard a woman in a beauty parlor tell a frien:: ''I have one child, but I want another. And now I have the money to pay the fine.''</p>
        <p>The Government is particularly concerned about more births because of an anticipated echo of the baby boom of 1962 to about 1973. People born in those years are beginning to bear children and will continue to do so for the rest of the century. Chinese demographers say this factor accounted for about one-third of the increase in births in 1986. Response Is Unclear</p>
        <p>Officials fear that a rise in the population is coming at the worst possible time. Unless something is done, they caution, population growth could rapidly accelerate.</p>
        <p>Yet it is not clear what the Government can do, short of the kind of campaign that has been so controversial in the past. A recent article in the China Legal News pointed to the challenge the Government faces.</p>
        <p>''Some peasants say, 'So long as they do not kill us, let's have another child and see what they do,' '' the article reported. ''The villagers have no way of dealing with this kind of situation, and cannot stop such births.''</p>
