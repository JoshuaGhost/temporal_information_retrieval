        <p>LEAD: From his father comes a passion for politics; from his mother, a delight in the intellectual rigors of economics. Throughout his short but successful career, friends say, Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sought to satisfy the demands of two often contradictory disciplines.</p>
        <p>From his father comes a passion for politics; from his mother, a delight in the intellectual rigors of economics. Throughout his short but successful career, friends say, Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sought to satisfy the demands of two often contradictory disciplines.</p>
        <p>That effort culminated today when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled Mexico since 1929, named Mr. Salinas, 39 years old, as its candidate for President in the general election next year. Barring an upset of historic proportions, he will take office on Dec. 1, 1988, and guide for the next six years the destinies of a country wrestling with its most severe political and economic crisis in more than five decades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas owes his likely elevation to Mexico's highest office primarily to Miguel de la Madrid, currently the President of Mexico, but a professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico here when Mr. Salinas enrolled as an economics major in 1966. He was quick to spot Mr. Salinas as a comer, and the careers of the two have been linked ever since.  Politically Active as a Student</p>
        <p>As a student, Mr. Salinas was active in both campus and national politics, becoming a member of the PRI, as the ruling party is known, at the age of 18, and working in his off-hours as an aide to a congressman. When he graduated in 1969, his thesis on ''Agriculture, Industrialization and Employment: The Mexican Case'' won him special mention in a competition of economists.</p>
        <p>After holding several low-level bureaucratic posts, Mr. Salinas did graduate work at Harvard University, earning master's degrees in public administration, in 1973, and in political economy in 1976. In 1978, after writing a thesis titled ''Production and Political Participation in the Mexican Countryside,'' he was awarded a doctorate in political economy and government.</p>
        <p>''I remember him as an unusually talented, creative and likable student,'' said John D. Montgomery, a professor of international studies at Harvard and one of Mr. Salinas's academic advisers. ''He's very smart and very capable, and I'm sure this will be good for him and good for Mexico.''</p>
        <p>''I would have thought of him more as a tecnico than a coalition building politician,'' Dr. Montgomery added in a telephone interview Friday as rumors of the imminent designation of Mr. Salinas spread, ''but he certainly has lots of presence. He made a lot of friends here.''  In de la Madrid's Footsteps</p>
        <p>After his American interlude, Mr. Salinas held a succession of government posts of increasing importance, specializing in economic affairs. When Mr. de la Madrid was appointed Minister of Budget and Planning, he named Mr. Salinas as his director of economic and social policy, and when Mr. de la Madrid became President, Mr. Salinas took over the slot he vacated.</p>
        <p>In 1981, when Mr. de la Madrid was nominated as the PRI candidate for President, he chose Mr. Salinas to head the party's research group, which played a key role in developing policy and running the party's campaign. Mr. Salinas has held Cabinet rank since 1982, and has played a major role in designing and carrying out an unpopular policy of economic austerity that only in recent months has begun to yield encouraging results.</p>
        <p>To the public, Mr. Salinas is known by the nickname Atom Ant. That sobriquet reflects not only the traditional Mexican irreverence toward authority, but also recognizes the energy, drive and persistence that are the main components of Mr. Salinas's public image.</p>
        <p>Though the likely future President would take office without having held any elected position previously, he comes from a family with an illustrious political background. His father, Raul Salinas Lozano, 70 years old and currently a Senator representing the key industrial state of Nuevo Leon, has served as Minister of Industry and Commerce and Ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>His mother, Margarita Salinas de Gortari Carvajal, is an economist who helped found and was first president of the Mexican Association of Women Economists. She comes from a long line of lawyers, engineers and military men, including one who fought in the battle of the Alamo and was promoted for his bravery there.  Strong Ties to the North</p>
        <p>Although born in Mexico City, on April 3, 1948, Mr. Salinas has strong ties to the northern state of Nuevo Leon, where he spent his childhood vacations. Because both his father's and mother's families have long been influential in the state, which borders Texas, he is regarded as being as much a norteno as a native of the capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas and his wife, the former Yolanda Cecilia Occelli Gonzalez, have three children: Cecilia, Emiliano and Juan Cristobal. According to a recently published biography, both of Mr. Salinas's sons were born at the family's ancestral home in Agualeguas, Nuevo Leon, ''in order to carry on the tradition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Salinas is also known as a skilled sportsman. He follows Mexican and United States baseball avidly, jogs 6 to 10 miles a day, and in 1971 won a silver medal at the Pan American Games in Cali, Colombia, for his horsemanship.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to make jokes about him riding the right horse and taking over the reins of power,'' a political associate said today. ''But Cali was the only time in his life that he ever came in second in anything, and he is entering this new phase of his life determined not to fail himself or Mexico.''</p>
