        <p>This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given.  CAFE GRECO, #1390 Second Avenue, at 72d Street (737-4300) - **(Aug. 21, 1987) A pretty little bar up front and an informal dining room with ocher walls, high ceilings and tall arching windows that look out on a lighted backyard garden provide the setting for a melange of Mediterranean cuisines. Starter options are carpaccio of salmon, glossed with olive oil and basil, and a tart layered with eggplant, tomato and zucchini. For a main dish, the chef has a masterly touch with seafood, such as a grilled salmon wth a zesty sauce of roasted red peppers, black olives and tarragon. Also recommended are medallions of lamb with a stock sauce. Entrees $15.50 to $19.50. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 4 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.  COASTAL, #300 Amsterdam Avenue, at 74th Street (769-3988) - **(June 12, 1987) A serious new fish house on the Upper West Side, this contemporary glass-fronted restaurant has a stainless-steel bar and aqua-colored walls covered with a coastline mural. If you can take the decibels, the rewards are considerable: vibrant little ceviche appetizers served in a large mussel shell; lobster bisque, and New England clam chowder. The broiled and sauteed seafood entrees are all recommended - from halibut with a choice of sauces to broiled grouper with Provencal sauce. Entrees $12.50 to $19. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M.  EAST, 1420 Third Avenue, at 80th Street (472-3975) - *(March 20, 1987) This handsome, countrified Japanese restaurant features an entertaining setting with low-slung communal tables and a knee-deep pit for those who find eating in the lotus position less than comfortable. You might begin with an assortment of sushi, maki rolls or sashimi. The best main course choices are salmon teriyaki with picked ginger garnish; any of the grilled fish options, and chicken teriyaki. Main dishes $8.50 to $20. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 11:15 P.M ; Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11:15 P.M.; closed Sundays.  LE FESTIVAL, #134 East 61st Street (838-7987) - **(Dec. 26, 1986) The dining room is soft and comfortable with rust-colored banquettes to punctuate the gray-felt decor, and the all-seafood theme is a timely idea. The Mediterranean fish soup is a very good starter, with morsels of snapper and bass in a saffron fish stock. For a main dish, you might choose dariole of salmon, with julienne of vegetables and set atop tomato beurre blanc; ravioli stuffed with lobster and wild mushrooms with sauteed chanterelles, or a straightforward grilled Dover sole with mustard sauce. Dinner prix fixe $40. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays.  PRIMOLA, #1226 Second Avenue, at 64th Street (758-1775) - **(Feb. 20, 1987) One of the more spirited and alluring Upper East Side restaurants is this Italian venture with yellow walls holding watercolors and poster art, wood wainscoting and pretty flower clusters. The menu is extensive and specials abound. You might start with a half order of pasta, perhaps the thin fedelini primavera or spinach gnocchi with a gratineed mozzarella and tomato sauce. Main course selections include grilled giant shrimp with lemon, garlic and oregano; veal sauteed with wild mushrooms, and seared baby lamb chops. Entrees $11.50 to $20.50. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 to midnight; Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 5 to 11 P.M.  VIOLETTA, 1590 First Avenue, at 83d Street (517-7090) - **(July 3, 1987) The two narrow dining rooms that make up this little East Side Italian restaurant are long on charm and short on elbow room; they feature salmon-toned walls, mirrors and expansive floral arrangements. Most of the pastas are recommended, and options include fusilli in cream sauce with pancetta and peas, as well as spaghetti with white clam sauce. For a main dish, you might order a double thick veal chop in mustard sauce; the mixed grill of chicken, sausage and cubes of beef in lusty garlic sauce, or red snapper fillet alla Livornaise, with black olives, capers, tomato and herbs. Entrees $15 to 25. Fridays and Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 4 to 11 P.M.  What the stars mean, page C24.</p>
