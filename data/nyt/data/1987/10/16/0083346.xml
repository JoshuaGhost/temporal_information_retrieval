        <p>LEAD: There's a lot of fun stuff for a 17-year-old like Alex Fernandez to do at the Y. He enjoys shooting hoops and lifting weights, and he likes the Teen Fathers club. It's a bunch of regular guys, and you can talk to Manny Cardona, the leader, about your feelings.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of fun stuff for a 17-year-old like Alex Fernandez to do at the Y. He enjoys shooting hoops and lifting weights, and he likes the Teen Fathers club. It's a bunch of regular guys, and you can talk to Manny Cardona, the leader, about your feelings.</p>
        <p>Alex qualified for the club five months ago, when his son, Andrew, was born. ''A baby's kind of a big responsibility,'' said Alex, who is a junior in high school. ''When she was pregnant I was upset. But I guess, you play, you pay. Birth control? Just, you know, we didn't use nothing like that.''</p>
        <p>''My mother was surprised and kind of hurt,'' Alex said, ''because my mother has plans for me and everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardona has found Alex an after-school job at Nice and Fresh Bakery, so Alex can contribute a little money for the baby. ''Manny's always telling me to hang with it, things will turn out,'' said Alex. ''Manny gives you hope. I see my plans are still there, I'm never giving them up.''</p>
        <p>Lately, he has been talking to Mr. Cardona about the Air Force. ''A nice place to be,'' Mr. Cardona said.</p>
        <p>Alex tells Mr. Cardona he is not ready for marriage, though he says he respects his girlfriend, Diane. ''She's not like this pretty-but-dumb girl,'' he said. ''She's real intelligent. She wants to go to college.''</p>
        <p>They had considered abortion, but decided against it. ''I really don't remember why - I forget,'' said Alex. ''It's a while back. Plus, Diane said, 'If you play, you've got to pay.' ''</p>
        <p>''They're a nice couple,'' said Mr. Cardona. He handed Alex a new box of baby booties. ''Thanks, Manny,'' said Alex, heading to the gym with the booties to shoot some baskets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardona finds his young fathers playing pool in back of La Cueva bar, dancing at the Crystal Ballroom, hanging out on East Main Street. ''Humberto!'' said Mr. Cardona, slowing his car. ''When?''</p>
        <p>''It's due Friday,'' said Humberto Perez, 19, a truck driver. Mr. Cardona stopped the car and gave the truck driver a box of booties.</p>
        <p>In the three-decker houses on the East Side of Bridgeport, they know Mr. Cardona. Several teen-agers, including Luis Marrero and Edgar Lopez, have made him the godfather of their sons. He finds them jobs so they can help support their babies, and he gets medical care for their pregnant girlfriends (in these neighborhoods the infant mortality rate is three times the national average.) He gives the young fathers booties to take home because he knows how it pleases the young mothers. And he awards everyone in his program a Y.M.C.A. certificate ''for admirably demonstrating the fatherhood qualities of caring and responsibility.''</p>
        <p>To the young fathers, he seems much more hopeful than most grown-ups, but Manny Cardona is a one-man program in a city of 150,000, and on bad days he despairs because of all there is to do. ''Sometimes I just park at this corner,'' he said, turning off East Main, ''and count the mothers going by who are alone.''</p>
        <p>Soon this may be a no-man program. The State Human Resources Department, citing budget constraints, is threatening not to finance the $34,000 program again. There are many here who think that would be a sin, including Edward Keane, chairman of the Governor's Council on Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy; Abe Reyes, director of the local Y.M.C.A.; Ludwig Spinelli, director of the Bridgeport Community Health Center, and Cesar Batalle, president of the Puerto Rican Coalition here.</p>
        <p>''Everybody loves to have Manny speak at their conferences,'' said Mr. Batalle, ''but he's still a one-man show begging for money each year.''</p>
        <p>''We spend $58 million a year on welfare payments to young moms in Connecticut,'' said Mr. Keane, ''and almost nothing on prevention.''</p>
        <p>In his desk, Mr. Cardona keeps a list of 50 families he has rescued from welfare.</p>
        <p>Wednesday night, he was shooting pool at La Cueva, hoping to find some new fathers. After dark, Jorge, Vincente, John and Miguel came in. ''I met Miguel at Boys Club when he was 13,'' said Mr. Cardona. ''I didn't know you're a father.'' ''Three years,'' said Miguel, who is 20. He explained to Miguel about Teen Fathers. Miguel said he was helping to support his girlfriend, but she is collecting welfare, so he did not want anyone to know - otherwise they would cut her support check.</p>
        <p>Later, away from the others, Mr. Cardona said, ''It's hard to get them off the welfare.'' He continued, ''They don't make much money and this is the only way for them to save a little. I'm doing my best. I'm dealing with Miguel. If I do my best with the father, we hope the family will be better. I can't do everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardona and the young fathers played more pool, had a couple of bottles of Bud and then it was time to go. They walked out to Barnum Avenue, and Mr. Cardona led them over to his Chevy Celebrity. He opened the trunk, and handed each man a pair of booties. Then they went their separate ways.</p>
