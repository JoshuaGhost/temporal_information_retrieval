        <p>The Walbro Corporation's board of directors reiterated its rejection of UIS Inc.'s unsolicited $27.25-a-share buyout offer and announced two steps designed to frustrate it.</p>
        <p>Walbro, a manufacturer of engine fuel systems based in Cass City, Mich., said a group of its shareholders, including all its directors and officers and some of its employees, had agreed not to dispose of their stock before Dec. 31, 1988. It said the group's holdings represented about 30 percent of the approximately 3.5 million common shares outstanding. The company also said it had sold, for $35 million, a new issue of preferred stock to the General Electric Credit Corporation on condition that G.E. Credit neither dispose of its holdings nor add to them, except in specified circumstances. The issue may be converted to about a million shares of common stock in October 1988, when it would represent more than a fifth of Walbro's voting shares.</p>
