        <p>LEAD: Rosa von Praunheim's ''Anita -Dances of Vice'' is a surprisingly tame movie to be made by the German director responsible for ''It's Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, Rather the Situation in Which He Lives'' (1970) and ''A Virus Knows No Morals'' (made in 1985 and released here this year). The former is a memorably savage satire on gay liberation conformism, while the latter is a grim examination of what might be called gay liberation's aftermath, in the era of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>

        <p>Rosa von Praunheim's ''Anita -Dances of Vice'' is a surprisingly tame movie to be made by the German director responsible for ''It's Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, Rather the Situation in Which He Lives'' (1970) and ''A Virus Knows No Morals'' (made in 1985 and released here this year). The former is a memorably savage satire on gay liberation conformism, while the latter is a grim examination of what might be called gay liberation's aftermath, in the era of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
        <p>''Anita - Dances of Vice'' is a fanciful homage to the instinctive, unstructured revolutionary in the person of Anita Berber (1899-1928), the notorious German dancer who, with her partner, Sebastian Droste, came to represent the decadence of 1920's Berlin with their nude dancing, their cocaine habits and their uninhibited sex lives.</p>
        <p>The film will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center at 6 P.M. today and 9:30 P.M. tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. von Praunheim (whose real name is Holger Mischwitzki, and who was born in Latvia in 1942) approaches the legend of Anita Berber obliquely through the fictitious story of elderly, tub-shaped Mrs. Kutowski (Lotti Huber), an irrepressible schizophrenic who, claiming to be Berber, goes around contemporary Berlin talking dirty and taking off her clothers in public places.</p>
        <p>Having been locked up in a psychiatric hospital, Mrs. Kutowski makes passes at the female nurses and recalls Berber's tumultuous career in hallucinatory flashbacks (in which Ina Blum plays Berber). In all ways she refuses to behave. ''Why don't you pretend that you're Helen Keller or Doris Day?'' says an exhausted therapist. Mrs. Kutowski is especially vicious to another patient, whom she calls Rosa Luxemburg and who goes on at boring length about the need for political action.</p>
        <p>''I want to shock the philistines,'' says the old lady. ''I'm bored with politics. I live for the moment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. von Praunheim clearly admires the free, anarchic spirit of the foul-mouthed mad woman, played with great gusto by Miss Huber, who looks a bit like the older sister of Divine, the drag queen star of John Waters's movies. Yet neither she nor the Anita Berber we see in the parody-flashbacks is shocking or outrageous enough to provoke the audience, many of whom (at the press preview I attended) walked out on the film.</p>
        <p>The director several times makes the unexceptional point that Berlin's decadence, exemplified by the behavior of Berber, softened up the German philistines for events to come. ''We need a strong leader,'' they are heard saying more than once. This seems much too simple and unequivocal a theme for a satirist of Mr. von Praunheim's already demonstrated perverse gifts.</p>
        <p>The film's single best moment has nothing to do with politics at all. It comes when a male patient is complaining about the food and the medical care in the psychiatric ward. ''I don't know when I'll get out,'' he says forlornly. He thinks a moment, then adds, ''I'm not even sure I'm here.''
