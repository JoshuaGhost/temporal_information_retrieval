        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Extinction of species through destruction of tropical forests is one of the major crises of our time. Conservation, the obvious remedy, is often hard to implement. But in Costa Rica, at this very moment, there is an opportunity to save a prime tract of forest.</p>
        <p>The land, the so-called Santa Elena Hacienda, which until recently was the site of the Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored airstrip for the support of the insurgents in Nicaragua, comprises 40,000 acres midway between two sections of Costa Rica's principal national park, the Santa Rosa Park. Its purchase would join the two pieces to form a consolidated park of 110,000 acres.</p>
        <p>The Santa Elena tract has great biological value of its own. It contains elements of tropical dry forest, a most endangered type of habitat, as well as a diversity of animals and plants known only from the site. Geologically, it represents the part of Central America that has been longest above sea level.</p>
        <p>To effect purchase of the land, $258,000 is needed, of which $100,000 has been pledged by the World Wildlife Fund-Conservation Foundation in Washington. This organization is receiving and administering funds in an attempt to raise the remaining $158,000. The Costa Rican Government, while having declared the Santa Elena Hacienda a part of their country's magnificent national park system, lacks the financial resources to purchase the tract. Our purpose is to call the Santa Elena Project to broader attention, in hopes of generating individual contributions. At a price of $4 an acre, the venture may well be the conservation bargain of the century. THOMAS EISNER  EDWARD O. WILSON, PETER RAVEN  Ithaca, N.Y., Sept 29, 1987  The writers are, respectively, professors of biology at Cornell and Harvard, and director of the Missouri Botanical Garden.</p>
