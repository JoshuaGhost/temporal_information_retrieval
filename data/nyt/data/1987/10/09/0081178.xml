        <p>LEAD: Scotland Yard said today that nine charges had been filed against Sir Jack Lyons, a business executive and financier, in connection with last year's takeover of the Distillers Company, the Scottish producer of whisky, by Guinness P.L.C..</p>
        <p>Scotland Yard said today that nine charges had been filed against Sir Jack Lyons, a business executive and financier, in connection with last year's takeover of the Distillers Company, the Scottish producer of whisky, by Guinness P.L.C..</p>
        <p>The police said Sir Jack, chairman of financial consulting firm J. Lyons &amp; Company, was arrested today and was scheduled to appear in a London court Friday to answer the charges. They include the theft of $:3.25 million, or around $5.35 million, from Guinness.</p>
        <p>Other charges include false accounting, executing a valuable security and ''aiding and abetting the giving of an indemnity to purchase shares.'' Sir Jack was released on bail. The authorities are investigating Guinness's apparently illegal attempt to increase the price of its shares during the takeover battle for Distillers, in order to increase the value of its share offer for Distillers. Sir Jack, 71, admitted in</p>
        <p>January that he had received $:2 million, or about $3.2 million, from Guinness for unspecified advisory services during the takeover of Distillers.</p>
        <p>Sir Jack was an adviser to the management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, which advised Guinness during its bid for Distillers.</p>
