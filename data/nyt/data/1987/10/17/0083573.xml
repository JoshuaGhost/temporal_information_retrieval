        <p>LEAD: Barely 20 years ago, when Wall Street labored with pen and pencil and messengers scurried through the city with briefcases loaded with stocks and bonds, the industry almost collapsed when trading volume approached a mere 20 million shares.</p>
        <p>Barely 20 years ago, when Wall Street labored with pen and pencil and messengers scurried through the city with briefcases loaded with stocks and bonds, the industry almost collapsed when trading volume approached a mere 20 million shares.</p>
        <p>But today, with Wall Street knee-deep in computers, the stock market's record volume of 338.7 million shares clicked through the machinery with barely a problem.</p>
        <p>''So far, so good,'' said Michael Minikes, treasurer of Bear, Stearns &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>He added, however, that salespeople were walking around with frowns on their faces ''because everyone who owns stocks has lost money in the last three days.'' A Word of Caution</p>
        <p>While pleased that the volume had been handled so smoothly, Mr. Minikes offered a word of caution.</p>
        <p>''These spurts last for just a few days,'' he said, but people could still get tired and make mistakes if the heavy volume persists. He noted that there should also be plenty of overtime work next week to deal with some of this week's hectic activity.</p>
        <p>Some traders speculated that the sharp price drops would mean that many investors who buy on credit will soon get margin calls from brokers demanding that the client put up more money or face the sale of the shares. The impact of this activity on the direction of the market next week is still uncertain.</p>
        <p>Operating on the principle that ''one man's meat is another man's poison,'' some traders seized on the uncertainty over Monday's stock market activity to dabble in a strategy known as the delta. They bought heavily on both sides of the market, not really caring if it goes up or down. They will lose heavily if the market moves only slightly but will make a killing if there is dramatic movement when trading begins next week.</p>
        <p>Other traders speculated that yesterday's precipitous drop in the stock market, coupled with the bond market's slide the day before, had cut into the capital of several firms so severely that one or two conceivably could be in violation of the minimum-capital rules of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The exchange said it was already reviewing the situation but so far had not uncovered any problem. In any case, the exchange said, all stockholder accounts are protected. Machinery in Place for Years</p>
        <p>Market officials noted that the machinery for handling huge trading volume was all in place - and has been for many years.</p>
        <p>Richard Torrenzano, vice president of the New York Stock Exchange, said that the market operated ''very smoothly'' throughout its busiest day ever. ''This has a lot to do with the state-of-the-art technology put in place in the last five to seven years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said that the exchange did not anticipate any problems developing, nor did he expect that any of the firms operating at the exchange would have to work overtime to handle the situation.</p>
        <p>Asked how long the exchange could deal with such a heavy load, Mr. Torrenzano replied, ''We hope, as long as it takes.'' 'Business as Usual'</p>
        <p>Because it handles the books for some 700 other leading traders and brokerage firms, Bear, Stearns is as close as anyone is to whatever problems may be developing, but, according to Mr. Minikes, it was ''business as usual.''</p>
        <p>He explained that the industry was able to keep up with the flow because all the buy and sell orders and all deliveries of stock were handled electronically in advance of a five-day settlement period. By Monday, the brokers who bought and sold particular stocks will get the results plus any discrepancies about what they actually did. They then will have four days to work out the problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Minikes noted that when volume was so heavy, everyone along the line ''has to be very careful'' because ''if you think you sold 10,000 shares of I.B.M. at 140 and you didn't and then have to sell at 135, you lost $50,000.''</p>
        <p>If the broker was responsible, he said, the broker has to make good, ''so he better be careful about checking everything.''  Busiest Trading Days  Following are the 10 heaviest trading days on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
