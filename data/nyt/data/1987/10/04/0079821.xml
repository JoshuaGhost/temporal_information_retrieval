        <p>LEAD: It used to be called the Paris of the Balkans, and it is still possible to see why, at least in part: the broad, tree-lined avenues and the buildings designed by French Beaux-Arts architects make Bucharest one of the handsomest cities in Eastern Europe. But the animation, the excitement and, of course, the showy upper class are long gone.</p>
        <p>It used to be called the Paris of the Balkans, and it is still possible to see why, at least in part: the broad, tree-lined avenues and the buildings designed by French Beaux-Arts architects make Bucharest one of the handsomest cities in Eastern Europe. But the animation, the excitement and, of course, the showy upper class are long gone.</p>
        <p>Today, Rumania suffers under the most repressive, most inefficient of all the Communist governments. Long food lines, empty shops, deserted roads - gas is strictly rationed - remind the visitor of nothing so much as the dreary aftermath of the last world war. The secret police, too, are everywhere: virtually every restaurant, for instance, has two or three tables occupied by single women visibly listening to their neighbors' conversation and occasionally jotting down a note.</p>
        <p>Add to that discouraging atmosphere the standard two-hour wait at passport control in a non-air-conditioned airport, the lack of taxis and the appalling condition of most rental automobiles and it would seem logical to skip Bucharest altogether; indeed, most tourists do, and the two main hotels are filled mostly with East Bloc visitors. As for visiting Westerners - mostly French and German -they normally head straight for the Black Sea resorts where sun, sand and sea can be had on the cheap.</p>
        <p>With all these shortcomings, however, Bucharest is still worth a visit. Indeed, the courageous visitor, fortified, perhaps, by a few Western provisions, will find many rewards here: from city planning and architecture to late medieval churches, from a museum that displays at least a few major masterpieces to a dazzling collection of Hellenistic gold, Bucharest offers a good many pleasures, all, of course, quite free of crowds.</p>
        <p>Rumania itself, although an ancient country, only won its independence from Turkey toward the end of the last century; as a result, it was only then that its capital, a picturesque accumulation of hovels, a few churches and some wooden palaces, began to develop into a real city, and partly, no doubt, because Rumanian is a Latin language, partly because the Rumanian aristocracy spent a good deal of its time in Paris, French architects were called in. As a result, there is, for instance, a replica of the Champs-Elysees, the Cosea Kisselev, bordered on either side with substantial private houses, built in a variety of eclectic styles ranging from Norman cottages to neo-Byzantine mini-palaces, all set in private gardens and lived in today by diplomatic missions or the cosseted, privileged hierarchs of the Communist party.</p>
        <p>Because gas is so scarce, there is very little traffic, and so it is possible to feel what these great 19th-century avenues were once like. This is also true in the center of town, the virtually deserted Palace Square. There, on one side, is the former Royal Palace, rebuilt by King Carol II in the 1930's and looking like a modified replica of the Gabriel buildings on the Place de la Concorde; and, amusingly enough, right opposite, the main headquarters of the party, built shortly after the war, with its open colonnade topping a massive, prison-like stubby tower. It manages to combine Russian and French influence in what can only be described as a Stalin-Louis XVI look.</p>
        <p>All through the city, whether in the main street, the Calea Victoriei, or in the more residential sections, the mood is essentially that of Paris's 16th arrondissement under sunnier skies and without glass and metal intrusions. Here, indeed, is a catalog of all the styles popular just before 1914, from neo-classical to neo-Romanesque with excursions into modified Arabic, orientalizing Gothic and fantasy-Muscovite. All this, without the roar of the traffic, makes it well worthwhile to take long walks in what is virtually an excursion into a recent urban past.</p>
        <p>There are surprises, too: Rumanian oils were one of the great speculative stocks of the 20's, and so several Art Deco apartment buildings, the work, naturally, of French architects, were built on the Strada Academiei. With their inset mosaics, rounded corners and colonnades, they are quite as good as anything that was done in the West.</p>
        <p>It would be worth enduring Bucharest for the architecture alone, but luckily, there is much more. While the early 17th-century churches in town are of no great interest except to specialists, there are three museums that, each in its own way, turn out to be intensely satisfying.</p>
        <p>The most unusual of these, the Village Museum, stretches alongside the Cosea Kisselev. Set in a vast and pleasant park, complete with forestlike areas and a lake, it is a collection of wooden houses embodying the different styles prevalent in the Rumanian countryside before World War I. There are small cabins and large farms; all are fully furnished with painted furniture and woven hangings while their fences, assembled in a wide variety of designs, offer added interest. A wooden church, its tall steeple covered with carefully carved scales, towers above the site; all in all, a visit makes for a singu-larly pleasant stroll through nature and the past.</p>
        <p>The National Museum, installed in a wing of the former Royal Palace, offers pleasures of a very different sort. Downstairs, the rooms are occupied by a variety of local objects: a wooden door made in 1453 for the Snagov monastery, divided into compartments carved with biblical scenes, for instance, or a splendid red and gold brocade court robe. Many of the exhibits reflect foreign influences, as is the case of the large, handsome sculptured Transylvanian polyptych dated 1510, with its Virgin and Child in the central panel and scenes from the New Testament all around them; in its blend of realism and expressionism, it is quite clearly derived from slightly earlier German models, and the murals from Arges are strongly marked by Byzantine art. Of all this, however, the most spectacular piece is like nothing else in Western Europe: a tall, three-level carved altarpiece, made in 1679 in a purely local Renaissance-Baroque style, is set with icons in elaborate gilt-wood frames carved into the shapes of birds and vines. Nearby, it is also worth taking a good look at the 1685 gold and filigree church-shaped reliquary with its five domed towers, pale-blue enamel panels, amiable lions and San Marco-like gables.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, the mood is very different. Here, the collection consists of Western paintings of extremely uneven quality, mostly bought by King Carol in the 20's and 30's. Some of the works are obvious fakes, others are in such poor condition as to have become virtually indecipherable. There are also worthwhile, if relatively minor paintings like the typically Mannerist Vasari, ''Madonna and Child With Saints,'' the dramatic ''Mother Giving the Breast'' by Orazio Gentileschi, or the pleasingly frivolous ''Bethsheba'' by Pellegrini.</p>
        <p>But what makes the visit thoroughly worthwhile is the small number of major masterpieces. First come two Memling portraits, one of a man holding a prayer book, the other of a woman, her hands joined in prayer, which have all the suave realism of that great Flemish painter; then, a little farther, Van Eyck's ''Man in the Blue Hat'' is as real, as detailed and as magical as any of the master's work, and finally El Greco's ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' is among that artist's largest and best works. Around a golden, luminous central figure of the Child, the Madonna in red, the shepherds in green and the angels in blue form a complex and highly successful composition. The figures are elongated, elegant and intensely spiritual at the same time, and the overall effect compelling: here, indeed, is reason enough to visit Bucharest.</p>
        <p>Nor is this all. A short walk from the National Museum, the Treasury has been installed in the basement of the former Central Post Office, a handsome Beaux-Arts building now staffed by singularly unpleasant female guards. First, on the ground floor, the visitor must walk through a large exhibition entitled ''The Age of Ceaucescu'' and dedicated to that dictator's dubious achievements. Odd as it may seem, however, it is all worth a look, partly as a neo-Stalinist manifestation - Nicolae Ceaucescu is pictured as the all-talented hero in a vast number of huge photographs -and partly just for the inherently comic quality of it all: The display is Marxist in every sense of the word, but while Karl is quoted, it is Groucho who most often comes to mind.</p>
        <p>Downstairs, however, all ambivalence ceases. There, in window after window, the finds made by archeologists in the Danube delta are displayed, and this author, at least, has never seen a larger or more impressive collection of Hellenistic gold. Extraordinary in both size and quality, the objects range from the ornamental - rings, bracelets, diadems - to the practical. There is a rhyton in the shape of a bull's head, for instance, carved with women holding tiny replicas of itself and datable to 300 B.C., which is both a work of art and a drinking cup.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are also religious objects, the most extraordinary of which is probably a fifth century B.C. miter. Adorned with griffins, seated priestesses holding birds, horses and lions, it blends richness with the most delicate of detail. That is true also of the contemporary helmet from Poiana Cotofenu, with its Egyptian-inspired double eye on the front, a man sacrificing a ram on one cheek-guard and the frieze of griffins on the other.</p>
        <p>There is a good deal more, too; a fine Roman oak-leaf funerary diadem, for instance, along with rings, earrings and necklaces, some first-rate Byzantine and Gothic pieces, an extraordinary 17th-century Transylvanian set of gold and enamel princely ornaments or an 18th-cendiamonds. Next to all this, the crowns and orders of the kings of Rumania look positively mundane, but the last window is worth a glance: There, jewelery confiscated by the Communist Government from the women of the aristocracy is displayed, and practically serves as a showcase of the Cartier style in our own century. Best of all, perhaps, this extraordinary collection, which, anywhere else in Europe, would be mobbed, can be seen in absolute peace since there are rarely more than four or five visitors at any one time.</p>
        <p>A little way outside Bucharest, it was once possible to visit Sinaia Castle, the neo-Romanesque and Art Deco country seat of the former royal family, but Mr. Ceaucescu has now moved in and it is closed to the public. A two hour's drive, though, takes us to Curtea de Arges, the 15th-century capital of Rumania. There, a Byzantine-inspired domed church was covered with frescoes in an expressionistic blend of Byzantine and Renaissance styles, and because the walls were plastered over in the 1600's, the colors are still absolutely fresh. It is the best way to get a feel for a culture that was virtually eradicated by the Turks, but that survives here and, to a greater degree, in the slightly later monasteries of Moldavia.</p>
        <p>That, alas, is not the case of the legendary Rumanian joie de vivre. Rumania's celebrated cuisine, a casualty of the acute food shortages, is no more than a memory. Its once-elegant shops now stand mostly empty of consumer goods; even the famous embroidered blouses are no longer to be found. But in a world where comfort is taken for granted, the very grimness of Bucharest reminds us that travel once required a measure of sacrifice and, now as then, the artistic and architectural rewards to be found here make those sacrifices worthwhile.  TIPS ON THE RUMANIAN CAPITAL</p>
        <p>Visas may be obtained on arrival at Bucharest airport. Further information is available from the Rumanian National Tourist Office (573 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y 10016; 212-697-6971), but arrangements should be made through a travel agent.</p>
        <p>Rates at either the Inter-Continental or the Bucuresti, the two large hotels geared to receive foreigners, are $73 for a single and $90 for a room with twin beds.</p>
        <p>Due to the absence of taxis, it is wise to order a car and driver to go to and from the airport.</p>
        <p>No matter what the signs say, dinner is not served after 8 P.M. Most Bucharest restaurants seem unwilling to serve foreigners; the hotels have their own dining rooms offering plentiful, if heavy and tasteless, food.</p>
        <p>Entrance to the Village Museum is $1, to the Art Museum 60 cents, to the Treasury 30 cents, to the church in Curtea de Arges 4 cents. It is a good idea to check opening hours locally.</p>
        <p>Gasoline is about $8.50 a liter (a bit more than a quart); car rental rates are high, and the rate structure of awe-inspiring complexity; depending on length of rental, a small, rickety Rumanian-made car will cost from $50 to $120 a day. - O. B.</p>
