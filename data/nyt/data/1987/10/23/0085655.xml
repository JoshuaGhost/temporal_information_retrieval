        <p>Holly Farms, a marketer of brand-name poultry based in Wilkesboro, N.C., has switched its agency to Long, Haymes &amp; Carr, down home in Winston-Salem. Left behind in New York is a ''stunned'' Grey Advertising, the agency for the last five years, which saw the client move into chicken-marketing eminence.</p>
        <p>The budget, according to the winner, is $25 million. The loser said the budget had been $18 million. According to Grey, the Dinah</p>
        <p>Shore campaign ''significantly raised consumer awareness of Holly Farms brand by increasing sales from 1982 to 1987 at a rate four times better than the industry.'' Actually the move to Long, Haymes is a return. The chicken folks used the agency to introduce their chickens in the early 1970's.</p>
