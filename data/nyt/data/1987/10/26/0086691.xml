        <p>LEAD: THE afternoon sabbatical included a walk on a quiet street, only a couple of blocks from the boardwalk that reminded them of villages on the English coast. Priscilla Welch prompted her husband, David, to bring his wallet so they could buy more tea, an absolute must last Wednesday, a cool, gray and blustery autumn day.</p>
        <p>THE afternoon sabbatical included a walk on a quiet street, only a couple of blocks from the boardwalk that reminded them of villages on the English coast. Priscilla Welch prompted her husband, David, to bring his wallet so they could buy more tea, an absolute must last Wednesday, a cool, gray and blustery autumn day. Perhaps they would also stop at the bakery they had discovered the day before, their first on the Jersey shore. David Welch, in particular, liked that idea.</p>
        <p>For now, Priscilla Welch is the one who prefers not to indulge her sweet tooth. Dressed in a ski jacket and jeans, strolling in the running shoes that some women her age wear only as fashion accessories, Welch refuses culinary temptation with thoughts of this Sunday's New York City Marathon. It is the third time she will run in the marathon, but the first time she expects to win.</p>
        <p>''That's why I'm here,'' she said. ''This time I'm focused for it. I'm stronger. I'm feeling like a caged bird. When the race begins, the cage will open and the bird will have flown.''</p>
        <p>Few birds fly faster. Last May, Welch completed the London Marathon in 2 hours 26 minutes 51 seconds, her best time ever, approximately six seconds slower than Ingrid Kristiansen's world best. Only seven women in the world have ever run 26 miles 385 yards faster, though.</p>
        <p>And one of them, Grete Waitz of Norway, who has won five consecutive New York City Marathons and eight of the last nine, is not entered, because she is injured.</p>
        <p>Fast times, however, are about all that Welch has in common with the elite company she keeps on the roads. Unlike Waitz, Joan Benoit Samuelson and Kristiansen, she is not a one-time track star or cross-country runner who has found gold on city streets around the world.</p>
        <p>In more ways, she may be like the woman next door who plunged, head-first, into the fitness boom. Welch is 42 years old, less than a month from her 43d birthday. She began jogging at 35, the oldest rookie, having virtually no background in athletics.</p>
        <p>In what she calls an eight-year interlude, her status has risen from complete novice to world class, a member of the 1984 British Olympic team who says her fastest times are still ahead. Her second-place finish in London established a world best time for masters runners, those over 40.</p>
        <p>Her achievements do not need any embellishment. Her age, however, makes them more remarkable. Distance runners can prosper well into their 30's, but improvement past 40 is rare for a world-class marathoner. In 1977, Mikki Gorman won the New York City Marathon at the age of 42, although her time was 2:43:10, almost 16 seconds slower than Welch's.</p>
        <p>Welch thinks that people tend to dwell on age, putting up their own barriers. To her, starting late meant she had spared her body years of wear and tear. There has been no mental fatigue, or burnout, to deal with either. She and her husband shared a laugh, she said, when autograph seeking youngsters rushing up to her outside the Olympic Village in Los Angeles in 1984 stopped abruptly, one saying, ''Naw, she's too old.''</p>
        <p>''I used to think sports was for the young,'' Welch said. ''But among marathoners, we all seem to be one age. I think this business of age is a social disease. An older woman can hold her own.''</p>
        <p>Born and raised in England, Welch and her husband have been living in Boulder, Colo., where he is studying to be a neuro-muscular therapist. They met in Norway, where she was serving in the Royal Navy and he was part of Britain's NATO contingent. When her enlistment ended, she remained in Norway to be with him. He encouraged her to begin jogging as a way of breaking the monotony of days with little to do.</p>
        <p>''I never thought it would reach this level,'' Priscilla Welch said. ''But as I got better, a whole new life opened up for me. And David opened the door.''</p>
        <p>They walked through that door to places such as the Shetland Islands, almost midway between Scotland and Greenland. David Welch was still serving in the armed forces in the early 1980's, and now, as husband and wife, they jogged along icy roads during the frigid winters, wearing heavy boots with spikes, head lamps in order to see in the dark, and often fighting gale-force winds.</p>
        <p>''We were called the crazy military people,'' she said. ''But I gained a lot of strength from that. And if we couldn't have run, we would have gone crazy.''</p>
        <p>The couple would save their money for an occasional trip to the United Kingdom where Priscilla Welch got her first taste of marathon running. She ran in London in 1980, finishing in 3:26.</p>
        <p>Almost eight years later, she is spending these last few days before New York putting the finishing touches on her training, an hour faster than she once was, but still not content. She and her husband arrived in the Metropolitan area almost two weeks early, so that she could acclimate herself to sea level after training in Colorado's mile-high altitude.</p>
        <p>Welch preferred a quiet setting to the bustle of Manhattan and a member of the New York Roadrunners Club offered her brother's house here. Under the direction of her husband, Welch has been spending the mornings doing speed work at the local high school which offered its track, then jogging on the boardwalk or the streets.</p>
        <p>She said she enjoys the solitude, the leaves falling like snow, rustling under her feet. Welch grew up in a small village called Upper Dean, one of three children. It was a place where walking or bicycling was the primary means of transportation.</p>
        <p>''Neither my mother or father drove a car,'' she said. ''And we lived miles from anywhere so the tiny village was our environment. I remember how the kids liked it when the fox hunt was held. We'd follow on bikes or foot.''</p>
        <p>She was struck by wanderlust at the age of 16, however, and went to visit to her aunt and uncle, not bothering to tell her parents she planned to stay. Both her relatives had been in the military and encouraged Welch to enlist. She joined for six years, was discharged, then re-enlisted when she realized that she had little in common with many women her age who were married and raising children.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the military regimen helped Welch compensate for her lack of running experience, instilling the discipline and fortitude required to push herself in training. Certainly, if she runs to form, she can win New York. Lisa Martin of Australia is another favorite.</p>
        <p>As a virtual unknown, Welch finished third in the 1983 New York City Marathon, when it was an adventure. In 1985, she finished fifth, which was oustanding given that she had won the Columbus, Ohio, marathon two weeks earlier. That is her only marathon victory, something that is beginning to frustrate Welch.</p>
        <p>Since 1985, she has limited her marathons to two or three a year, her goal now, faster times and victories. Welch said she still runs for pure enjoyment, but her success now has involved her in the politics and economics of the sport as well.</p>
        <p>She lets David negotiate with the shoe companies for endorsement contracts and the race directors for appearance fees and prize money. Much of what she has won in road racing thus far has been to put her husband through school and re-invest in her own training.</p>
        <p>''If I win New York,'' Welch said. ''I'll give the car and money to David. I like running for running's sake. The rest of it is like being a mare at a horse auction.''  Still Running After 40  Priscilla Welch of Britain turned 40 almost three years ago. Here are her marathon performances since then:</p>
