        <p>LEAD: With commentators in the Western countries heralding political changes in the Soviet Union and China, a group of writers and scholars from many of the world's Communist-ruled countries gathered in New York over the weekend, and a different and generally less optimistic view prevailed among them.</p>
        <p>With commentators in the Western countries heralding political changes in the Soviet Union and China, a group of writers and scholars from many of the world's Communist-ruled countries gathered in New York over the weekend, and a different and generally less optimistic view prevailed among them.</p>
        <p>The group, made up in large part of exiled dissidents from Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary, Cuba and other countries, argued through many sessions over the nature of the changes.</p>
        <p>The conference at the Omni Park Central Hotel, titled ''The Future of Communism,'' was sponsored by the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a conservative foreign-affairs study group based in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>No clear picture of the future of Communism emerged from the speeches and discussions. But there were scholarly analyses, mingling with jokes, parables and parodies that, taken together, provided a composite view of the changes taking place in Communist-ruled countries today. No Fundamental Change</p>
        <p>In the end, it became possible to distinguish a warning to Westerners: Even with the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev striving to free itself from rigid orthodoxy and to allow a greater measure of expression, Communist countries are unlikely to change fundamentally, or to become less menacing, by their own volition.</p>
        <p>Such change will take place, if at all, only because the West remains strong as the weaknesses of the Communist system take their toll over time, many of the participants contended.</p>
        <p>''An economically flourishing and democratic Communist society is as possible as a flying crocodile,'' said Alexander Zinoviev, an exiled Soviet writer who lives in Munich, West Germany. Mr. Zinoviev has argued that Mr. Gorbachev's program of glasnost, or openness, is a cynical and hypocritical maneuver, designed in part to encourage complacency in the West.</p>
        <p>Another Soviet exile, Eduard Kuznetsov, news director for Radio Liberty in Munich, said that if is assumed that Moscow will liberalize and thus become less threatening, ''then we are not obliged to do anything.'' 'An Improved Lie'</p>
        <p>Ivan Svitak, a Czech exile who teaches philosophy at California State University at Chico, said: ''Glasnost is not a new policy. It is an improved lie, a new temporary facade. Glasnost is an ideology of reforms without actual reforms.''</p>
        <p>One view of change in the Soviet bloc was contained in a paper by a Hungarian, Miklos Haraszti, who is editor of Beszelo, an officially tolerated dissident journal. It was read to the conference when Mr. Haraszti, who lives in Hungary, was unable to come to New York, apparently for personal reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haraszti wrote that in Budapest in the years after World War II, the Communist authorities tore down a church damaged by bombing in order to create ''an imitation Red Square,'' where the country's leaders would greet the ''working masses'' during the parades that marked national holidays.</p>
        <p>The square was dominated by ''a giant Stalin,'' a statue that towered behind the review stand. But after the de-Stalinization efforts in the Soviet Union in 1956, the authorities tore down the statue and only Stalin's boots were left, Mr. Haraszti wrote.</p>
        <p>Some months later, even the boots were removed, though many people continued to refer to it as Boot Square. They were replaced by a simple marble platform, a symbol of reform and change. But crowds continued to come to the square every year, paying obeisance to the Communist rulers who stood on the platform.</p>
        <p>The leaders decided to encourage the atmosphere of reform even more by building a National Theater in the square equipped with a special balcony where they would stand, as before, on holidays.</p>
        <p>''These changes are simply variations in form of the same impertinent, self-congratulatory monolithic power,'' Mr. Haraszti said.  ''Maybe it doesn't matter anymore on what kind of platform our leaders will wave and smile. The boot is inside us.'' By RICHARD BERNSTEIN With commentators in the Western countries heralding political changes in the Soviet Union and China, a group of writers and scholars from many of the world's Communist-ruled countries gathered in New York over the weekend, and a different and generally less optimistic view prevailed among them.</p>
        <p>The group, made up in large part of exiled dissidents from Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary, Cuba, and other countries, argued through many sessions over the nature of the changes.</p>

        <p>Such change will take place, if it takes place at all, only because the West remains strong as the weaknesses of the Communist system take their toll over time, many of the participants contended.</p>
        <p>''An economically flourishing and democratic Communist society is as possible as a flying crocodile,'' said Alexander Zinoviev, an exiled Soviet writer who lives in Munich, West Germany. Mr. Zinoviev has argued, contrary to a view gaining ascendency among many specialists on the Soviet Union, that Mr. Gorbachev's program of glasnost, or openness, is a cynical and hypocritical maneuver, designed in part to encourage complacency in the West.</p>
        <p>Another Soviet exile, Eduard Kuznetsov, who is news director for Radio Liberty in Munich, asked why people in the West are eager and ready to find hope in the actions of the current Soviet leaders. If it is assumed that the Russians will liberalize and thus become less threatening, he went on, ''then we are not obliged to do anything.'' 'An Improved Lie'</p>
        <p>Ivan Svitak, a Czech exile who teaches philosophy at California State University at Chico, said: ''Glasnost is not a new policy. It is an improved lie, a new temporary facade. Glasnost is an ideology of reforms without actual reforms.''</p>
        <p>The thinking behind this statement was elaborated on by several participants who argued, among other things, that people living under Communism have become so inured to the system that they resist changes that Westerners might find beneficial.</p>
        <p>This view was summed up in a paper by a Hungarian, Miklos Haraszti, who is editor of Beszelo, a dissident journal. It was read to the conference when Mr. Haraszti, who lives in Hungary, was unable to come to New York, apparently for personal reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haraszti wrote that there is a large square in Budapest where the Communist authorities, in the years after World War II, tore down a church damaged by bombing in order to create ''an imitation Red Square,'' a place where the country's leaders would greet the ''working masses'' during the parades that marked national holidays. Huge Statue of Stalin</p>
        <p>Early on, the square was dominated by ''a giant Stalin,'' a statue that towered behind the review stand. But after the de-Stalinization efforts in the Soviet Union in 1956, the authorities tore down the statue and only Stalin's boots were left, along with a feeling that Hungary had ''done away with Stalinism itself,'' Mr. Haraszti wrote.  Some months later, even the boots were removed, though many people continued to refer to it as Boot Square. They were replaced by a simple marble platform, a symbol of reform and change. But crowds continued to come to the square every year, paying obeisance to the Communist rulers who stood on the platform.</p>
        <p>The leaders decided to encourage the atmosphere of reform even more by building a great National Theater in the square - equipped with a special balcony where they would stand, as before, on holidays.</p>
