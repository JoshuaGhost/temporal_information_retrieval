        <p>LEAD: One of the leading commanders of Miskito Indian guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua has agreed to end his campaign against the Sandinista Government.</p>
        <p>One of the leading commanders of Miskito Indian guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua has agreed to end his campaign against the Sandinista Government.</p>
        <p>The commander, Uriel Vanegas, appeared in Puerto Cabezas on Saturday with several dozen of his estimated 400 men. He shared a platform with Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who flew here from Managua for the occasion.</p>
        <p>''We can support the Sandinista project if it defends Indian rights,'' said Mr. Vanegas. His men carried rifles, grenade launchers and machine guns as they listened to his speech in Puerto Cabezas's main plaza.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vanegas said he and his troops were not surrendering, and vowed that they ''will not turn in a blessed rifle to the Sandinista Front.'' An Important Breakthrough</p>
        <p>Under an agreement signed by Mr. Vanegas and Sandinista officials, the Indians will be allowed to keep their weapons, and they will form police and militia units to defend Indian villages. Mr. Vanegas said some of his men ''will become part of the national army.''</p>
        <p>Relief workers and others in Puerto Cabezas described Mr. Vanegas's decision as an important breakthrough that could lead to an end to the six-year war between the Indians and the Sandinista authorities.</p>
        <p>They estimated that with Mr. Vanegas's decision to stop fighting, there are between 800 and 1,500 Indian guerrillas still in the field. Brooklyn Rivera, the most prominent Indian leader, has put the figure at 2,800.</p>
        <p>The Moravian Church, to which most Miskitos belong, is serving as an intermediary in talks between the Government and Indian commanders. 'About to Accept a Cease-Fire'</p>
        <p>''Most of the Indian fighters are about to accept a cease-fire,'' said Rev. Andy Shoegren, superintendent of the Moravian Church in Puerto Cabezas. ''During the last two years, the Government has taken a different attitude toward these people and has started respecting their feelings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shoegren said if Government officials were successful in trying to persuade Mr. Rivera to return to Nicaragua, ''That would be a very big step.''</p>
        <p>The announcement that Mr. Vanegas and his 400 men would stop fighting represented an important victory for the Government, which has tried to persuade the Indians to press their demands through political rather than military means. Miskitos Helped by C.I.A.  The agreement was also a blow to anti-Sandinista guerrillas. These guerrillas, who are known as contras, constitute a much larger force than the Miskito rebels.</p>
        <p>Miskito leaders received C.I.A. help at one time, but were cut off after they refused to unite with the contras.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Mr. Vanegas pledged that he and his men would fight against the contras if contras attack Indian villages in the future.</p>
        <p>''There will always be differences between us and the Sandinista Front,'' Mr. Vanegas said. But he said the situation had changed considerably, and that the Sandinistas had promised ''to be flexible and make serious reforms.''  Nicaragua Talks to Begin</p>
        <p>MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Oct. 5 - (Special to The New York Times)President Daniel Ortega Saavedra today opened what he said would be a ''national dialogue'' between the Government and opposition groups. The talks are slated to begin this week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortega said the dialogue was convened under terms of the new Central American peace accord, which requires the Government to lift restrictions on political freedom.</p>
        <p>Eleven political parties, including several that boycotted the 1984 Presidential election, were invited to the dialogue and have named delegates. Also, the Democratic Coordinator, an umbrella coalition for anti-Sandinista political parties, trade unions and business groups, was granted a seat.</p>
