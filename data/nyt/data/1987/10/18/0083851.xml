        <p>LEAD: Two top members of the Cuomo administration have told the Governor that they might leave soon to take higher paying jobs with private corporations.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Two top members of the Cuomo administration have told the Governor that they might leave soon to take higher paying jobs with private corporations.</p>
        <p>Two top members of the Cuomo administration have told the Governor that they might leave soon to take higher paying jobs with private corporations.</p>
        <p>The two are R. Wayne Diesel, the state's budget director, and Lawrence Kurlander, the director of criminal justice, both of whom make $92,059 a year.</p>
        <p>The Governor, according to administration officials, is upset that Mr. Diesel might leave now, just as the administration is putting together its budget for next year. The officials say he has asked Mr. Diesel to stay on until the new budget is passed by the legislature, in late March or early April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diesel, who has been budget director since September 1984, did not return telephone messages today. But Cuomo aides said Mr. Diesel had not reached a final decision on whether to accept the corporate job offer, which is from a bank.</p>
        <p>If he leaves, the aides said, his likely successor would be Henrik Dullea, the director of state operations, or Dall Forsythe, a Cuomo fiscal adviser. The budget director is one of the most powerful figures in New York government, working with state agencies and often overruling them in putting together the Governor's $45 billion-a-year spending plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurlander, who has been with the administration since Mr. Cuomo took office in January 1983, rejected one offer from the American Express Company but is said to be considering a second offer from the company that would include more money. He did not return telephone messages today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kurlander, a former district attorney of Rochester, is the Governor's chief criminal justice aide, advising him on everything from prisons to the State Police to the naming of special prosecutors.</p>
        <p>His likely successor, according to Cuomo aides, would be Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, who, as the state's commissioner of correctional services, oversees the prison system. Mr. Coughlin, who is regarded as one of the Governor's most capable commissioners, currently reports to Mr. Kurlander.  Special Session Unlikely</p>
        <p>A special session of the Legislature, which had been considered possible, now appears unlikely.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, a Binghamton Republican, has wanted the Legislature to return to pass two bills - one changing the way hospitals are reimbursed for patient care and the other increasing pensions for some city and state employees. Earlier versions of both measures were passed by the Legislature in July but vetoed by Governor Cuomo as too expensive.</p>
        <p>A general agreement on the hospital issue has been reached by the Governor and the Legislature, though a detailed bill has yet to be drafted. The pension issue is still being negotiated. Legislators are under strong pressure from hospitals and retirees to resolve the issues.</p>
        <p>But Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said, ''The odds are against a special session.''</p>
        <p>He said he would like to see the wording of the hospital and pension bills worked out now ''so the legislative leaders and the Governor can shake hands on them.'' If that can be accomplished, he said, there is no reason to bring the Legislature back into session. Actual passage of the bills, he said, can wait until the regular legislative sessions begin, in January.</p>
        <p>''I think everyone would like to pass the bills,'' Mr. Miller added, ''but coming back just for them, I don't think so.'' He said, however, that he had told the Governor ''I would like to see things move a little quicker'' in negotiations on the bills.</p>
        <p>Another reason Mr. Miller opposes a special session, Republicans believe, is that some of his fellow Assembly Democrats are under investigation for possible payroll abuses and he fears reconvening the House will only draw more attention to the investigations.  Restoration Plan Studied</p>
        <p>A decade ago the State Senate Chamber underwent a multimillion dollar restoration, complete with new marble and gold leaf. But the Assembly, under Speaker Stanley Fink, rejected similar work on its century-old chamber. Mr. Fink, critical of what he said were the aristocratic ways of the Republican-controlled Senate, proclaimed that his Democratic controlled House believed there were better ways to spend the state's money.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fink did not seek re-election last November, and the new speaker, Mr. Miller, has taken an interest in restoring the Assembly chamber. Little noticed in this year's state budget is $350,000 he had allocated to study the feasibility and cost of restoration.</p>
        <p>The chamber originally had a vaulted ceiling, eliminated long ago because of structural problems, and architects are excited that Mr. Miller has expressed interest in the possiblity of restoring it. It remains to be seen, however, whether Assembly members will agree to spending the millions of dollars that the restoration will almost certainly cost.</p>
        <p>''We are very delighted,'' said Dennis McFadden, the executive director of the Temporary State Commission on the Restoration of the Capitol. ''It is potentially one of the most exciting preservation and restoration initiatives any place and would return an extraordinary space to the people of New York.''</p>
