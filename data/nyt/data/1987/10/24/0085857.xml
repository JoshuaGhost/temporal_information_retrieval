        <p>LEAD: Jessica McClure's injured right foot apparently will not have to be amputated, but the toddler may lose two toes as a result of her two and a half days trapped in a dry well, a hospital spokeswoman said today.</p>
        <p>Jessica McClure's injured right foot apparently will not have to be amputated, but the toddler may lose two toes as a result of her two and a half days trapped in a dry well, a hospital spokeswoman said today.</p>
        <p>''I think if anything, it would just be those two toes,'' said Stellyce Allen, a spokeswoman for Midland Memorial Hospital where the 18-month-old girl has been cared for since her rescue a week ago from the narrow shaft.</p>
        <p>Jessica slid into the 8-inch dry well last week and her foot was jammed at an awkward angle for 58 1/2 hours, cutting off circulation and threatening it with gangrene that doctors had warned could have required amputation of the foot.</p>
        <p>But today, as surgeons operated to remove dead skin for the third time, they said the main concern was over two toes, according to Ms. Allen.</p>
        <p>Asked if amputation was still a possibility, she said, ''But it will not be for the entire foot.''</p>
        <p>Jessica's dramatic rescue last Friday was televised nationally, and she has received thousands of cards and gifts from well-wishers.</p>
        <p>The toddler's mood has been improving daily as she continues a diet of solid food, hospital officials said.</p>
