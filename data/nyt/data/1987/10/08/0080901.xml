        <p>CJM Partners Inc. said it had withdrawn its $24-a-share bid for Dyncorp. CJM Partners said Dyncorp and its advisers ''have already had more than two weeks'' to study the offer and have been unwilling to negotiate a binding agreement. CJM Partners is a Delaware company owned by Jorge E. Carnicero, chairman of Dyncorp, and Elis S. Jacobs, a private investor. On Sept. 21, CJM Partners offered $260 million to acquire all of Dyncorp's outstanding shares. Earlier yesterday, Dyncorp said that CJM had agreed to raise its offer to $25 a share if Dyncorp signed a letter of intent by 5 P.M. today and agreed to pay a break-up fee of 75 cents a share if the deal were not completed.</p>
