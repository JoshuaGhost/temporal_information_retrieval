        <p>LEAD: The stock market absorbed new pressures without losing its balance yesterday - on the 58th anniversary of the market crash of 1929 - and the Dow Jones industrial average managed to close with a slight gain.</p>
        <p>The stock market absorbed new pressures without losing its balance yesterday - on the 58th anniversary of the market crash of 1929 - and the Dow Jones industrial average managed to close with a slight gain.</p>
        <p>While most stocks lost ground and selling of smaller issues continued, the declines were modest compared with some of the shattering falls the stock market has recently experienced. The Dow average moved up a third of a point, to close at 1,846.82.</p>
        <p>That stability was a far cry from eight days ago, when the Dow tumbled 508 points, or 22.6 percent, its worst day ever and a chilling reminder of Oct. 28, 1929, when the market dropped 12.8 percent. Talks on Deficit</p>
        <p>As the market had a relatively stable day, White House and Congressional negotiators conferred on ways to reduce the budget deficit. Their discussions have so far produced few conclusive results.  [ Page D1. ]  Losses were reported in the Asian and Pacific markets in today's trading. In Tokyo, the dollar's foreign-exchange value continued to plunge despite intervention by the Japanese central bank, causing selling of the shares of exporting companies. At the close the Tokyo exchange's leading index had fallen 2.4 percent. The Australian market closed with a loss of about 7 percent, and the Hong Kong market had posted a similar-sized drop by the end of the morning session.</p>
        <p>By the time the market opened in New York yesterday, it was confronted with a new challenge, a steep drop in the dollar. Stock prices began to fall on fears that Washington might raise interest rates to halt the currency's decline. In the first half-hour, the Dow was down by more than 60 points.</p>
        <p>But prices turned up as reports reached Wall Street that central banks were intervening in the currency markets in restrained fashion, modifying but not reversing the dollar's plunge.</p>
        <p>That appeared to ease some fears of the inflationary effect of a weaker dollar. In the credit markets, short-term rates fell and long-term rates rose modestly.  [ Page D19. ]  Considering that the dollar fell to a seven-year low against the West German mark and weakened significantly against the British pound and the Japanese yen, the stock market's relatively calm performance surprised some experts.</p>
        <p>''If somebody had told me this morning that the dollar would fall as far against the mark as it did, I'd have assumed that the stock market would have had a much poorer day,'' said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy committee at the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's apparent that the market assumes the dollar will be allowed to fall further,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacKinney said he thought it was possible that Washington was sending a message to Bonn to cut interest rates, or else see West Germany's exports hurt as the cheaper dollar makes American products more competitive. The link between the health of the dollar and the stock market has strengthened in recent years as international investors have become more active.</p>
        <p>An unstable dollar can hurt American stock prices in several ways. For one thing, it discourages foreign investment in American stocks because it endangers the value of those investments. A troubled dollar can also prompt the Federal Reserve to defend the dollar by pushing interest rates higher, so as to attract foreign investment in dollar-denominated securities like Treasury bonds and bills. Money invested in such fixed-income securities is not available for investment in the stock market. And the higher rates could also curb corporate and consumer spending, thus hurting the domestic economy. Walking a Tightrope</p>
        <p>Allowing the dollar to fall unchecked has its own dangers, of course. Such a decline can cause dislocations in trade among nations, for example, which is one reason the stock market is walking such a tightrope.</p>
        <p>''I think the realization is beginning to hit the U.S. investor that the ball is out of our court now,'' said Thom R. Brown, chief investment strategist for the investment firm of Butcher &amp; Singer in Philadephia. ''Germany and Japan have to lower their rates, and they have to do it quickly. That will allow us to ease interest rates, and still be able to maintain a reasonably stable dollar.''</p>
        <p>In yesterday's session, the Dow moved higher by midday, in nervous and volatile trading. At one point the average was up 35 points.</p>
        <p>But market experts were quick to point out that the tone of the market was poor. Many broader gauges of the market's health were down. Volume was 279.4 million shares, up from 260.2 million on Tuesday, and the eighth-highest daily total.</p>
        <p>Analysts who track the flow of money in and out of stocks said millions of dollars continued to hemorrhage from the stock market, Carl Adams, chief analyst at Carl Marks &amp; Company, said investors had become short-term traders ''because they can't make reasonable assumptions.'' 'A Reference Point'</p>
        <p>''There is nothing that they can look to as a reference point,'' Mr. Marks said. ''What's reasonably priced today could be high-priced tomorrow. They don't know politically where the currencies are going to be, where interest rates will be, what sort of corporate environment there will be.''</p>
        <p>Markets around the world continued in flux.</p>
        <p>In today's trading in Tokyo, the 225-stock Nikkei average lost 543.64 points, to finish at 22,033.89, a 2.4 percent decline. Yesterday the index fell 257.43 points, or about 1.1 percent, to close at 22,577.53. , after a 632.40-point gain on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In Australian trading today the All-Ordinaries index fell 7.3 percent, losing 102.2 points, to close at 1,286.2 Prices slid in Hong Kong today with the Hang Seng index down 167.35, to 2,202.81, a 7 percent drop, at the end of morning trading. Yesterday the index, which plunged 33 percent on Monday, had given up 25.56 points.</p>
        <p>In London, the Financial Times/ Stock Exchange 100 index declined 44.9 points, to 1,658.4, yesterday amid concern about the upcoming British Petroleum stock offering. The British Government's offer to sell one billion B.P. shares to the public has failed to sell out, and the Thatcher Government is under pressure to call the deal off.</p>
        <p>The offer had been expected to be undersubscribed because of the world stock market collapse. The potential losses for the British, Japanese, Canadian and American underwriters - including Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company; Salomon Inc.; Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Company - have been estimated at nearly $2 billion.</p>
        <p>The New York and American Stock Exchanges and other American stock markets again closed at 2 P.M., two hours early, so the backlog of orders could be cleared away. The exchanges will also close early today and tomorrow. The move is also believed to be an effort to calm the battered market.</p>
        <p>Although the Dow industrial average managed its small gain yesterday, 0.33 points, or two-hundredths of 1 percent, about twice as many stocks fell on the New York Stock Exchange as rose. There were 1,153 losers and 591 stocks that gained.</p>
        <p>Broader gauges of market performance were also mixed: the composite index of all the stocks traded on the Big Board fell 0.20, to 130.31, and the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index eked out a 0.09 point gain, to 233.28. American Exchange Is Down</p>
        <p>Small stocks continued to lag. The American Stock Exchange index fell 4.51, to 234.01, and the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues dipped 4.46, to 291.88.</p>
        <p>According to Laszlo Birinyi Jr., chief technical analyst at Salomon Brothers, the market's continuing malaise could be seen in that only eight stocks on the Big Board achieved 12-month highs, against 671 that reached new lows. In the O-T-C market, he said, eight stocks also hit highs, but 1,273 hit lows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Birinyi said there were other disturbing signs yesterday, among them that ''$515 million came out of the stocks on the Big Board'' and that ''$148 million came out of the Dow,'' despite its nominal gain. He also said that ''98 percent of the selling'' was done in institutional-sized block trades - an indication, he said, that ''the institutions are basically selling into any upturn.''</p>
        <p>Other analysts were more sanguine. Some took comfort from indications that the recent market collapse might undercut legislative efforts to include protectionist clauses in any new trade bill. Many historians and economists have contended that the Smoot-Hawley Act, which erected import barriers shortly after the 1929 crash, made the subsequent Depression even greater.</p>
        <p>Among individual stocks, American Telephone and Telegraph rose 1 1/8, to 28 5/8; Dow Chemical was up 1 5/8, to 66; International Business Machines was unchanged at 118 and Exxon was down 2 1/4, to 40 3/4.</p>
        <p>In the battered over-the-counter market, Apple Computer gained 1 3/4, to 32; Intel rose 3, to 31 3/4, and Microsoft closed at 39 1/2, down 1 3/4.</p>
