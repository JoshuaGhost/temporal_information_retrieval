        <p>LEAD: The crew of a United Airlines jetliner reported Thursday that they had come within 50 to 75 feet of colliding with a commuter airliner at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The crew of a United Airlines jetliner reported Thursday that they had come within 50 to 75 feet of colliding with a commuter airliner at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.</p>
        <p>But the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that the United jet, carrying 101 people, was given clearance to take off only after the commuter plane was out of the way, having crossed over United's runway on its landing approach.</p>
        <p>F.A.A. controllers in the O'Hare tower insist that the planes were safely separated and that a near collision did not occur, according to Mort Edelstein, an agency spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelstein said that an inquiry was under way and that it could not yet be determined which of the conflicting accounts was accurate. Concern on Collision Hazard</p>
        <p>The report of the incident raised new concern about the collision hazard, particularly since it followed so closely an undisputed close call on Tuesday between an airliner and a cargo plane landing at St. Croix in the Virgin Islands. They missed by just 50 feet.</p>
        <p>Still another near-collision was reported to have occurred Wednesday when a four-engine Air Force refueling plane and a commuter airliner came within 200 feet of one another at the Yuma International Airport in Arizona. A Marine Corps controller prevented an accident by radioing instructions to the two crews just in time, according to Chief Warrant Officer Tim Bennett, a spokesman for the Marine Corps Air Station at the Yuma field.</p>
        <p>In the incident in Chicago, which occurred in midafternoon Thursday in good weather, the United Airlines Boeing 737 was on a flight to Omaha. The other plane, an Air Wisconsin Fokker F-27 turboprop, was arriving from Milwaukee with 52 people on board. The commuter craft operates under the name United Express in a marketing partnership with United Airlines.</p>
        <p>The United jet was assigned to take off on runway 32L, headed 320 degrees to the northwest. The commuter plane was cleared to land on runway 9L, headed 90 degrees to the east. The runway pavements do not cross, since the west-to-east strip begins 2,000 feet to the east of runway 32L. But planes landing to the east must fly directly across the other runway before touching down. Pilot's Account of Incident</p>
        <p>According to Matt Gonring, a spokesman for United, this is the account of the incident given by the United captain:</p>
        <p>As the twin-jet plane was rolling down the runway, after receiving a takeoff clearance from the Chicago tower, the captain saw that the F-27 about to cross in front of him from the left. The throttles were pushed to full power. And the captain climbed off the runway at an abnormally steep 25- to 30-degree angle and banked 10 degrees to the left to avoid the other plane. The normal angle for taking off is 20 degrees. The pilot estimated the United jet passed over the tail of the commuter plane by 50 to 75 feet.</p>
        <p>The aviation administration said the controllers in the tower sharply disputed this account.</p>
        <p>According to the agency spokesman, ''The controller was positive he did not release the United jet for takeoff till the F-27 had passed runway 32L.'' Two other controllers on duty supported their colleague's statement, insisting the jet did not just miss the other craft and that ''the incident was nothing like what was reported by the United captain,'' the spokesman added.</p>
        <p>Officials at Air Wisconsin said they still had not received a report from their crew about what had happened. But the United spokesman quoted the Air Wisconsin pilot as saying he was aware only of the shadow of the United jet passing overhead.</p>
        <p>The National Transportation Safety Board, which has the chief responsibility for investigating major accidents or incidents, said it had asked the F.A.A. to supply ''more definitive information'' on what had occurred.</p>
