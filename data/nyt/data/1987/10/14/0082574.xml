        <p>LEAD: The Senate confirmed C. William Verity Jr. as Secretary of Commerce today but only after shutting off a threatened filibuster by a handful of conservative Republicans who oppose his support of expanded trade with the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The Senate confirmed C. William Verity Jr. as Secretary of Commerce today but only after shutting off a threatened filibuster by a handful of conservative Republicans who oppose his support of expanded trade with the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The conservatives were led by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and Jesse Helms of North Carolina. They argued that Mr. Verity, in his desire to strengthen Soviet-American trade ties, would sacrifice American foreign policy goals such as improvement in Soviet human rights performance and increased emigration from the Soviet Union. The Senators also said they feared that Mr. Verity would try to ease the restrictions on exports of sophisticated technology to the Eastern bloc. D'Amato's Point of View</p>
        <p>In the end, the conservatives mustered only 11 votes against Mr. Verity, while 85 senators voted for his confirmation. Senator D'Amato said that even though he knew the confirmation would not be blocked, he considered it important to ''sensitize'' Mr. Verity and the White House to Senate concerns about human rights in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''This man does not appear to believe in the primacy of human rights - he believes in profits,'' said the New York Republican, who quoted at length from Mr. Verity's confirmation testimony and from speeches by Mr. Verity during his tenure as chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council. The council is an organization of American business leaders and Soviet Government officials established in 1973, with the blessing of the United States Government, to promote better trade relations.</p>
        <p>''I can think of almost no one else less suited to the job from the standpoint of national security,'' said Senator Helms. ''It is Mr. Verity and some of his colleagues who are now literally selling the Soviets the rope with which to hang the free world.'' Former Armco Chairman</p>
        <p>Mr. Verity, 70 years old, is a former chairman of Armco Inc., the nation's fifth-largest steel producer. The job he fills as head of the Commerce Department has been vacant since July 25, when Secretary Malcolm Baldrige was killed in a horseback riding accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verity is expected to make changes in several key department posts. The new lineup has been rumored to include promoting S. Bruce Smart, now the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, to Deputy Secretary of Commerce. That No. 2 spot is now occupied by Clarence J. Brown, a former Congressman from Ohio, who has been ill for several weeks.</p>
        <p>Kempton Jenkins, a former State Department official and now Armco's Washington representative, has been mentioned most often as a likely replacement for Mr. Smart in the international trade position, but Mr. Jenkins said today that he had not been asked to take the job. He also remarked that ''the financial sacrifice would be staggering'' after his 30 years in government and only the last seven in the private sector.</p>
