        <p>LEAD: Greater-than-expected demand from speculators and solid buying by foreign investors at the Treasury's 30-year bond auction yesterday caused prices of outstanding issues to rise sharply.</p>
        <p>Greater-than-expected demand from speculators and solid buying by foreign investors at the Treasury's 30-year bond auction yesterday caused prices of outstanding issues to rise sharply.</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of this week's three-part $29 billion offering of Treasury notes and bonds, interest rates were not much different from what they were at the previous quarterly financing in November, and they remained well within the range that has prevailed since last April.</p>
        <p>''I think domestic investors are still playing it close to shore,'' said E. Craig Coates, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. But he noted that speculators and aritragers who do not normally hold bonds for long periods of time were active buyers.</p>
        <p>Although the Treasury's financing ended strongly, securities dealers said the concerns that had caused bond yields to rise modestly since Jan. 20 were still present.</p>
        <p>''There is still no answer to the debate between those expecting a weak economy with lower rates and those who worry about higher rates with more inflation,'' said one institutional bond salesman. An Eye on the Weak Dollar</p>
        <p>Fears of inflation stem largely from the recent increase in oil prices, to about $18 a barrel, and the effects of the drop in the dollar the last two years. The weaker dollar has already begun raising the prices of imports and is expected to increase foreign demand for American exports.</p>
        <p>''Investor demand dwindled at a yield of less than 7 1/2 percent on the long bond,'' observed Sam Paddison, product manager in the government bond department at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.</p>
        <p>More than half the day's gains came late in the day after some securities dealers learned that they did not buy as much, at the Treasury's 1 P.M. auction, of the 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 as they had expected. Realizing that their purchases at the $9.25 billion sale were not large enough relative to the amount of bonds they had sold in previous days, some firms began buying aggressively, pushing prices higher. The Treasury received a record $26.77 billion of bids for the new bonds, up from about $21 billion in November. Outcome of Late Trading</p>
        <p>By late in the day, the outstanding 7 1/2 percent issue was offered at 100 30/32, up 1 1/8 points on the day, to yield 7.42 percent. The bellwether Treasury issue was as low as 99 26/32 earlier this week but remains below its recent peak of 102 1/4 on Jan. 20.</p>
        <p>The newly auctioned 7 1/2 percent issue, which is identical to the outstanding bonds except that payment is not due until Feb. 17, were offered late in the day with a yield of 7.44 percent, down from an average of 7.49 percent at the auction.</p>
        <p>Ernest Gruenebaum, senior vice president at Yamaichi International (America), estimated that Japanese firms bought about 25 percent to 30 percent of the new 7 1/2 percent bonds, 20 percent or less of the $9.75 billion of 7 1/4 percent 10-year notes sold Wednesday and 10 percent or less of the $10 billion of 6 1/2 percent three-year notes sold Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Purchases of the magnitude estimated by Mr. Gruenebaum and other dealers for Japanese firms would be slightly less than their estimated purchases in November. Officials at Japanese firms noted that a large portion, perhaps one-third, of their buying this week was not designated for Japanese investors.</p>
        <p>The 6 1/2 percent notes due in 1990 were offered at 100 1/8 to yield 6.45 percent, up from about 99 29/32 at the auction. The 7 1/4 percent notes due in 1996 were at 100 3/4, to yield 7.14 percent, up from about 99 31/32 at the auction. Corporate Sector Buoyed</p>
        <p>Prices were little affected by the Federal Reserve's late afternoon announcement of a $500 million increase in the nation's basic money supply, to $732.4 billion, in the week ended Jan. 26.</p>
        <p>The higher prices for Treasury issues quickly spread to the corporate sector and helped underwriters distribute $200 million of Fort Howard Paper Company five-year notes at 7.084 percent and $250 million of Tenneco Credit notes at 8.393 percent.</p>
        <p>Demand was especially strong for junk bonds offering yields of more than 10 percent, and underwriters were able to sharply increase the size of two new issues.</p>
        <p>The Enron Corporation's offering of 12-year senior subordinated debentures through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was increased to $625 million from $400 million, while Masco Industries' 10-year senior subordinated note issue, offered through Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Company, was raised to $250 million from $160 million.</p>
        <p>As for Enron, formerly known as Houston Natural Gas, the notes bear an initial coupon of 7 percent, rising to 10 5/8 percent on Feb. 15, 1992. Placing of Yield at 10.67%</p>
        <p>The offering price of 85.908 results in a yield of 10.67 percent to the conversion date in 1992 and an all-in yield of about the same. The 10 5/8 percent yield was more than three and a half percentage points greater than for 10-year Treasury notes and about four percentage points over five-year Treasury notes.</p>
        <p>Enron's long-term rating was reduced slightly by the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation last week to BB+, the same rating assigned by McCarthy Crisanti &amp; Maffei, a New York credit rating firm. Moody's rated the issue Ba-3.</p>
        <p>Masco's 10 1/4 percent senior subordinated notes due in 1997 were initially offered at 99 1/2 to yield 10.33 percent, but a few hours after the initial offering the notes had risen to a bid price of 100 3/4. Although the proposed yield for the notes was steadily reduced from the originally proposed 10 3/4 percent, investor demand for the issue continued to grow, and by late yesterday sources close to the financing said that about $1 billion of orders had been received. Ratings for the Masco Issue</p>
        <p>Yielding about 3.1 percentage points more than Treasury notes of similar maturity, the Masco issue was rated Ba-1 by Moody's and BB-by S.&amp;P. The notes are not callable for three years and are not refundable for five years.</p>
        <p>After a deluge of new issues in the last two months of 1986, the junk bond market has benefited from a much lighter calendar of new issues so far this year. Investors and securities dealers also noted that many buyers were attracted to the market early this year by the unusually wide spread between yields of the low-quality corporate issues and yields of Treasury issues.</p>
        <p>They added that junk bond prices were firm this week despite newspaper articles that the insider trading investigation encompasses some activities of Michael Milken, head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond operation. Because Drexel has dominated the issuing and trading of junk bonds in recent years, reports late in 1986 that Mr. Milken was being investigated depressed prices then.</p>
