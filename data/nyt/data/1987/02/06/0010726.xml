        <p>LEAD: Jesse W. Moore, who gave the final approval to the fatal launching of the space shuttle Challenger, has resigned from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the agency announced today.</p>
        <p>Jesse W. Moore, who gave the final approval to the fatal launching of the space shuttle Challenger, has resigned from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the agency announced today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore is the highest official to leave the agency in the shakeup that followed the explosion that destroyed the shuttle and killed its crew of seven on Jan. 28, 1986.</p>
        <p>As the head of the space shuttle program, he was in the launching control room when the Challenger lifted off and had the last word in the decision to launch.</p>
        <p>''The agency and the nation have been served well and faithfully by Jesse Moore,'' James C. Fletcher, the NASA Administrator, said. ''In the most difficult of times for NASA he filled the demanding jobs of associate administrator for space flight and director of the Johnson Space Center.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore told the Presidential commission that investigated the accident that he had not known about a history of problems with seals at the joints of the shuttle's solid-fuel boosters. It was a leak in a seal that caused the explosion, the commission found.</p>
        <p>He also said that he had not known that special waivers had been issued to allow the use of the rockets on six consecutive flights preceding the Challenger launching or that engineers from the rocket builder, Morton Thiokol Inc., had vehemently argued that the launching should be postponed.</p>
        <p>His testimony caused the commission to say in its report that ''there was a serious flaw in the decision-making process leading up to the launch of Flight 51-L.''</p>
        <p>Five days before the accident, Mr. Moore had been named director of the Johnson Space Center but delayed assuming that post until midyear. In October, at his request, he was reassigned as a special assistant to the NASA general manager and went on indefinite leave. He will become director of program development of Ball Aerospace Systems in Boulder, Colo. ----Engineer Said to Suffer HOUSTON, Feb. 5 (AP) - An engineer who tried to stop the cold-weather launching of the Challenger says he suffers from nightmares, weeping and headaches more than a year after the disaster.</p>
        <p>The engineer, R. V. Ebeling, was in charge of the solid rocket motor ignition system, final assembly and ground tests for Morton Thiokol.</p>
        <p>In an interview published Wednesday by The Houston Chronicle, Mr. Ebeling, who is 60 years old, said he had been under psychiatric care as a result of the accident and that we would not return to Thiokol, where he has worked for 25 years.</p>
        <p>''I've been under terrible stress since the accident,'' he said. ''I have headaches. I cry. I have bad dreams. I go into a hypnotic trance almost daily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebeling said he first warned about cold weather affecting the rocket seal 24 hours before Challenger was to be launched. When he learned that the temperatures at launching might be as low as 18 degrees, he said, he assembled a group of engineers to discuss the problem. The engineers were overruled by managers for Thiokol and NASA.</p>
        <p>Last week, Roger Boisjoly, 48, another Thiokol engineer who tried to stop the launching and who alsohas said he suffers nervous disorders as a result of the accident, filed a $1 billion suit against Thiokol alleging defamation of character, and has filed a $10 million administrative claim against NASA.</p>
