        <p>LEAD: To many Americans, this city produces nothing but hot air, inflated egos, monstrous transfers of money to the undeserving and, now and again, a good law and a true statesman. But more than anything, day in and day out, Washington churns out paper.</p>
        <p>To many Americans, this city produces nothing but hot air, inflated egos, monstrous transfers of money to the undeserving and, now and again, a good law and a true statesman. But more than anything, day in and day out, Washington churns out paper.</p>
        <p>With reports, studies, position papers, surveys and other analysis spewing forth in dizzying profusion, it sometimes takes considerable effort to be noticed.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, ''Making America Work Again: Jobs, Small Business and the International Challenge,'' a report by the National Commission of Jobs and Small Business that took 17 months and more than $600,000 to produce.</p>
        <p>To try to prevent it from becoming just one more soporific until the next group decides a still more exhaustive inquiry is needed, the commission decided to attack the ''yawn - another report'' factor head on.</p>
        <p>''To raise the public dialogue, there has to be awareness,'' explained Christine Gresock, a media consultant hired recently by the commission. A Four-Month Exercise</p>
        <p>The promotional exercise that culminated this morning in an almost two-hour news conference, complete with a written program telling in what order the four Congressmen and various other contributors would speak, began months ago.</p>
        <p>Former Presidents Ford and Carter were persuaded to act as honorary co-chairmen and have written an article on the report's themes that was distributed recently to newspapers. Various commissioners, including former Representative John Brademas, now president of New York University, visited two dozen newspaper editorial boards throughout the country. Speeches were made, and talk shows were importuned to broadcast the message.</p>
        <p>Advance copies were sent under embargo to reporters, and follow-up calls were made the day they arrived to see if there were questions.</p>
        <p>''I'm a high-energy person,'' Ms. Gresock said. For the past week or so, ''what I did was to sit on the telephone'' to orchestrate coverage. A majority of the 22 commissioners were on hand today to discuss the findings with the two dozen or so reporters who showed up, a respectable showing.</p>
        <p>Former Representative Parren J. Mitchell of Maryland, one of the prime movers in the effort, declared flatly, ''We will not bring down the unemployment rate in this country unless the recommendations of this commission are carried out.''</p>
        <p>The commission's original mandate was to find out how to create 10 million jobs in small business, the main source of new jobs in recent years. But the panel was quick to spot the fast-emerging issue of international competitiveness and it seized its opportunity.</p>
        <p>The first of its principal suggestions is that the Government mount ''a major effort, engaging the attention of public and private leaders nationwide, to alert Americans to the realities of the new world economy.''</p>
        <p>The other recommendations involve improving work force skills, finding new ways for small business to attract capital, restoring the nation's ''Yankee trader'' tradition and reorganizing business, labor and government to meet foreign competition.</p>
        <p>This report, for which the C. S. Mott Foundation contributed about $300,000, may not keep as many people up late as the America's Cup races, but some of the substance is expected at least to find its way into this year's trade legislation.</p>
        <p>And with ''competitiveness'' the new Washington buzzword, there will probably be no lack of people in Congress and the Administration who will continue to feed the publicity machine. ''That,'' Ms. Gresock declared, ''will continue.''  WASHINGTON TALK</p>
