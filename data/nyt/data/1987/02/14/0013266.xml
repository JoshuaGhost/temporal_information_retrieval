        <p>LEAD: Eight weeks ago the Yankees rejected an invitation to sign Jack Morris as a free agent and have an arbitrator determine his 1987 salary. Yesterday an arbitrator, Richard Bloch, decided that the Detroit Tigers should pay the pitcher $1.85 million.</p>
        <p>Eight weeks ago the Yankees rejected an invitation to sign Jack Morris as a free agent and have an arbitrator determine his 1987 salary. Yesterday an arbitrator, Richard Bloch, decided that the Detroit Tigers should pay the pitcher $1.85 million.</p>
        <p>The figure establishes two salary-arbitration records: It is the highest salary awarded in the procedure's 12-year history and it gives Morris the biggest raise, $975,000, ever gained in arbitration.</p>
        <p>Morris, who accepted the Tigers' arbitration offer after the Yankees and three other teams had shunned him, also matched Fernando Valenzuela of Los Angeles as the highest-paid pitcher for the coming season. Valenzuela, who is in the middle year of a three-year contract, set an arbitration record with a $1 million salary in 1983, a figure that later was eclipsed by the $1.2 million for Tim Raines in a winning effort in 1985 and the $1.35 million for Wade Boggs in an arbitration loss last year. Mark Already in Jeopardy</p>
        <p>Morris's record salary could last only until Arvid Anderson rules on Don Mattingly's case, which he will hear Monday. Mattingly is seeking $1,975,000 and is expected to win against the Yankees' $1.7 million figure. In baseball arbitration, the ruling is one offer or the other, nothing in between.</p>
        <p>Orel Hershiser's $788,000 raise last year, from $212,000 to $1 million, had been the largest raise before Morris's increase from $875,000. The Tigers had submitted a $1.35 million figure.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the outcome of the case, which Bloch heard Thursday in Chicago, Richard Moss, Morris's lawyer, who also argued the Valenzuela record case, said: ''It's not that unusual a thing. As in all salary-arbitration issues, it was a question of where does this player belong in the salary structure. This is where he belongs.''</p>
        <p>Morris, who has won more games, 140, than any other pitcher in the last eight years, had a 21-8 record last season, the last of a four-year, $3.45 million contract. He became a free agent, ignored the Tigers' arbitration offer, said he had no intention of returning to Detroit and instead preferred to sign with one of four teams: Minnesota, the Yankees, Philadelphia and California. Meeting With Steinbrenner</p>
        <p>After the Twins chose not to sign him, Morris and Moss met with George Steinbrenner in Tampa, Fla., Dec. 18. They said Morris would sign a multiyear contract or play for one year at a salary to be determined by an arbitrator. The next day, though, Steinbrenner said he would not accept Morris's proposal because his first priority was to re-sign his own free agents, Ron Guidry and Willie Randolph.</p>
        <p>Shortly before the midnight deadline that night, Morris accepted the Tigers' arbitration offer. Randolph re-signed with the Yankees, but Guidry remains a free agent.</p>
        <p>Of the six free agents in the last two years who accepted their club's offers to go to arbitration, Morris was the first to reach the hearing stage. The other five negotiated their salaries.</p>
        <p>He had lost to the Tigers in arbitration in 1982, playing for $450,000 instead of the $650,000 he wanted. After that season he signed the four-year contract that led to this historic arbitration.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the case, Bloch, the arbitrator, said by telephone from Chicago: ''Dick Moss's position was that this was a guy who does it all. The club's position was that he is an all-around quality pitcher, but they questioned if he should be set apart in salary.'' Braves Win Again</p>
        <p>In other cases decided yesterday, Greg Harris of Texas won and Jim Acker of Atlanta lost. Harris, a relief pitcher, doubled his salary to $620,000 despite the Rangers' effort to pay him $575,000. Acker, also a relief pitcher, became the third player this year to suffer a pay cut in arbitration, falling from $367,500 to $350,000. He had sought $450,000.</p>
        <p>Glenn Wong, the arbitrator, gave the Braves their second winning case. In the other one, Darryl Motley also emerged with a pay cut. Last week, Hershiser of Los Angeles suffered a cut. In 224 cases before this year, only one player, Aurelio Lopez of Detroit in 1983, was cut in arbitration. Stephen Goldberg was the arbitrator in Harris's victory.</p>
        <p>Clubs have won seven cases, players six.</p>
        <p>Two players negotiated new contracts yesterday before their hearings. Spike Owen, the Boston shortstop, agreed to a $350,000 salary and Mike Mason, a Texas pitcher, settled at $280,000.</p>
