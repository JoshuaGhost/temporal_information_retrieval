        <p>President Reagan's endorsement of a new health care plan marks a victory for the elderly who fear bankrupting illness and a victory for common sense over nervous orthodoxy. Credit the President and his Health and Human Services Secretary, Otis Bowen, for both.</p>
        <p>The plan would improve the Medicare program of health insurance for 30 million elderly people. It now limits hospital coverage after 60 days. By adding $4.92 to the $17.90 monthly premium, Dr. Bowen would provide unlimited hospital days and pay for all out-of-pocket costs over $2,000. Patients would still have to pay the portion of doctor's fees that Medicare will not pick up, but relief from the risk of huge hospital bills offers substantial peace of mind.</p>
        <p>The Federal program could offer a much better deal than private enterprise. The insurance industry must finance overhead and promotion costs; the Feds simply update their computers. Thus what Dr. Bowen can offer for $59 a year private insurers typically price at $180 or more.</p>
        <p>Some Administration officials denounced the breach of commitment to private solutions and worried about enhancing the resurgence of Democrats in Congress. Others argued, with more reason, that the catastrophic-illness insurance might open the door to Federal funding of nursing home care - a much costlier proposition.</p>
        <p>Rather than bowing to doctrine and politics, however, the President stuck to the merits. He challenged the critics to come up with a better way to meet the need. When they didn't, he embraced the Bowen plan. With Congress already eager for the idea, White House endorsement virtually guarantees enactment. It will be a proud part of the Reagan legacy.</p>
