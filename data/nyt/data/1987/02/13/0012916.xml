        <p>Several Marine guards were reassigned from their postings at the American Embassy here after an internal investigation indicated they had been involved in illegal currency transactions, Ambassador Arthur A. Hartman said today.</p>
        <p>''There were no security violations involved,'' Mr. Hartman said.</p>
        <p>The development followed the disclosure that an embassy marine, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree, had been lured to work for Soviet intelligence by a female Soviet translator at the embassy.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Hartman, who declined to identify or give the number of the affected marines, said all those involved had been relieved of their duties.</p>
