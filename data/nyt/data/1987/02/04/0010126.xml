        <p>LEAD: The Economy</p>
        <p>The Economy</p>
        <p>The Government's main forecasting index surged 2.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in nearly four years. But most analysts cautioned that the index of leading indicators seemed to overstate the economy's prospects considerably because of one-time influences, particularly the new tax law. Indeed, the report was widely interpreted primarily as confirmation of a partly artificial pickup in business activity late last year.  [ Page D1. ]</p>
        <p>Sales of new homes jumped sharply in December as the housing industry completed its best year since 1978. The Commerce Department said that 749,000 new single-family homes were sold last year.  [ D2. ]  Mortgage rates continued to fall in January, according to two surveys.  [ D2. ]  Factory orders climbed a healthy 1.2 percent in December.  [ D3. ]</p>
        <p>Prominent bankers and financiers jousted with Fed members in a rare public hearing. The issue was whether one of the nation's most basic banking laws that separates banking from securities underwriting should be breached.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>The House passed a $20 billion clean water bill by voting to override President's Reagan veto.  [ A1. ] Companies</p>
        <p>Long-term contracts to buy oil at $18 a barrel have been accepted by the group of four large American oil companies operating in Saudi Arabia. The Aramco partners had rejected similar terms just a month ago, but they apparently now believe prices will stabilize at $18 a barrel or higher.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>American Medical International received a $1.7 billion bid from Leroy A. Pesch, a Chicago doctor who led the multimillion-dollar buyout of Republic Health last year. American Medical is expected to reject the surprise $20-a-share bid.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>MCA has bought 9 percent of Coleco Industries, the nation's third-largest toymaker, for $20 million.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>Diamond Shamrock lost $42.2 million in the fourth quarter. The announcement came a day after it proposed a restructuring.  [ D3. ] Markets</p>
        <p>Yields rose in the credit markets as bidding began on this week's $29 billion of new Treasury notes and bonds. Dealers said there was a growing unease in the marketplace due to a rise in overnight rates and the prospects of higher inflation this year.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>The stock market came under selling pressure. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.97 points, to 2,168.45, with most of the drop coming late in the session. The blue-chip index had risen to a record on Monday with a 21.38-point gain.  [ D6. ]</p>
        <p>The dollar rallied late in the day to close essentially unchanged in hectic trading. In New York, gold rose $2, to $402.75.  [ D13. ]  Prospects for a multinational meeting this month to discuss the dollar are apparently brighter.  [ D17. ]</p>
        <p>Two subpoenas issued to Ivan F. Boesky were quashed by a Federal judge because a U.S. attorney said they would interfere with criminal investigations.  [ D17. ]</p>
        <p>Cattle futures prices moved higher, partly in response to a stronger cash market.  [ D13. ]  Technology</p>
        <p>A classic case of technology trickle-down is A.T.&amp; T.'s roving robot, Scooter. The driverless vehicle, designed for production sites, maneuvers using a guidance system developed for military and aerospace applications.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>The dominance of the yacht Stars &amp; Stripes may be anchored in aerospace research and plastic decals. The yacht's hull is covered with a new plastic skin designed to make the craft slip through the water with less drag. Advances.  [ D4. ] Today's Columns</p>
        <p>Fears that the stock market boom will end when it collides with economic realities are growing not only among economists and some Government officials but also among old Wall Street hands. Leonard Silk. Economic Scene.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>Utility securities are the specialty of a Duff &amp; Phelps closed-end fund that set a record with its $1.3 billion initial public offering. The fund, which also provides credit ratings on bonds, says it tries to avoid any conflict of interest. Market Place.  [ D20. ]</p>
