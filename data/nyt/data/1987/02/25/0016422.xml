        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Not having noticed that General Wojciech Jaruzelski has introduced one person, one vote (or any kind of vote) into Poland, I have trouble following your reasoning as to why United States sanctions should be lifted against Poland (editorial, Feb. 9) when elsewhere you have urged sanctions against South Africa.</p>
        <p>You say sanctions against Poland appear to have reached the point of diminishing returns. In South Africa this month, the Catholic Bishops' special study on the effect of sanctions reached precisely the same conclusion, finding that sanctions are retarding rather than encouraging reform.</p>
        <p>And while sanctions have done no harm to our national economy (indeed, South Africa is experiencing an economic upsurge and large surpluses in trade and the balance of payments), they have thrown thousands of blacks out of work. For example, the U.S. ban on the import of agricultural products has caused deep unemployment among blacks in the Cape Province fishing industry. As one black told a U.S. reporter, ''my family is on the breadline, and I will break the jaw of any man who preaches to me about sanctions.''</p>
        <p>You say that more could now be gained from pursuing serious dialogue with Warsaw than from sanctions. The same is certainly true in South Africa. As recently as Jan. 30, President P.W. Botha publicly repeated the Government's goal of vigorously pursuing the expansion of our democracy to include blacks. And he called for peaceful dialogue and negotiation of a new constitutional framework for South Africa.</p>
        <p>Surely, you might consider supporting the positive approach of peaceful dialogue in South Africa rather than demonstrably ineffective - indeed counterproductive - sanctions, which retard reform while causing only blacks to pay the price for American moralizing. HERBERT BEUKES  Ambassador, Republic of South Africa  Washington, Feb. 10, 1987</p>
