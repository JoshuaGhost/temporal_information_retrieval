        <p>LEAD: FOR the first time in several years, I have made an early start at readying my fishing gear for the forthcoming season, at practicing that which I so glibly preach.</p>
        <p>FOR the first time in several years, I have made an early start at readying my fishing gear for the forthcoming season, at practicing that which I so glibly preach.</p>
        <p>There are, to be sure, two fully rigged surf rods still hanging from the rafters of an open-air shed, and they will have to be taken inside the house. But that is an improvement over this time last year when they were still propped against a honeysuckle bush where they were left after my final striped bass foray in mid-November.</p>
        <p>The rods could remain in the shed all winter without deterioration, but if I don't bring them inside I will never get around to re-wrapping three of their guides that are now held in place by electrician's tape. The tape is perfectly adequate, but its continued presence would mark me as a slapdash angler. Taped guides are for emergencies. In my case, they replaced three others that were broken when an overhanging limb on a woods road tangled with my truck's rod carrier. One doesn't waste time with elaborate repairs when fish are feeding in the surf.</p>
        <p>Even if a saltwater outfit is hosed down with freshwater after each day of fishing, there is always a chance that the threaded rings on all-metal reel seats will be locked in place by corrosion if left untouched all winter. Ideally, one should remove reels from rods at the season's close, but if that isn't done the threads should at least be given a good shot of penetrating oil.</p>
        <p>The soft white metal used in the reel housings and reel seats of some freshwater outfits quickly corrodes when that gear is used for marine angling, and if reels and rods are not separated at the season's end they may be coupled forever.</p>
        <p>Although first-class reels need little attention beyond periodic oiling, there are times, as when they have been accidentally dropped in the sand or submerged in the roiling sand-filled surf, when they should be disassembled, cleaned, oiled and greased.</p>
        <p>Fiberglass, graphite or boron fly rods require almost no maintainance. The metal ferrules of bamboo fly rods are subject to corrosion, and such rods should never be left assembled for more than a few days. Fly lines should be washed with warm water and soap, rinsed and wiped with a dry cloth before they and the reels that hold them are put away. If you wish to go to the trouble, storing a fly line in large loose coils will make it easier to handle the following spring. The trout and salmon fly fisherman should pay attention to his flies at this time of year. Inevitably, as the fishing season progresses, nymphs, wet flies, dry flies and streamers are indiscriminately mixed and they should be sorted out. This sorting also lets you know what flies you will have to tie or purchase before the land is once again in May's soft embrace.</p>
        <p>Those who were flogging the surf for stripers and bluefish before World War II had to pay a great deal of attention to the linen lines that were used in that era. One of my jobs as a youngster after father and I had been surf fishing was to remove the linen lines from our revolving spool reels, either by transferring them to a large, wooden drying spool or by stretching them across the meadow between a white oak at its northern edge and a cherry tree behind the garage. Such lines rotted if they were were allowed to remain wet on the reel.</p>
        <p>The modern monofilament lines used with both spinning and revolving spool reels are remarkably tough, and moisture does not harm them. Prolonged exposure to sunlight weakens monofilament, however, which is why you should not leave your rods outdoors. A good mono line might serve the casual surfcaster for three years, and he who fishes two or three days a week throughout the season might go through two lines a year. Mono is usually first weakened by fraying, which can be caused by its being dragged against rocks when a fish is on, or by an imperfection in one of the rod's guides or tip-top.</p>
        <p>You should carefully inspect the first 15 or 20 feet of the line at the start of each day's fishing, and some anglers make a habit of cutting off that much line two or three times a week. If you use conventional rather than spinning gear, you can feel line imperfections while reeling in your lure.</p>
        <p>New England frugality does not permit me to discard all of the monofilament line that a big surf casting reel - whether spinning or conventional - can store. If your reel holds perhaps 300 yards of line, the chances are that you will never have more than half of that yardage in the water. The remaining line is merely filling the reel and offering insurance that you will be able to handle the occasional truly large fish you will encounter. When the time for a new line has come, I remove only half of the line from a reel of that size and fasten new line to old with a carefully tied blood knot. I may someday regret this maneuver, but I doubt it.</p>
        <p>If you are a typical angler, your lures are in a snarl at the season's close. This is a good time to arrange them by size and type and to inspect and sharpen their hooks. Either a small file or a hook hone is good for this.</p>
        <p>Hook-sharpening is a simple but important ritual ignored by many. A hook is sharp if its point catches when dragged across your thumbnail. Veteran muskelunge anglers are the most dedicated hook sharpeners I have ever encountered. Muskies are moody fish. You might cast over them for a week without getting a hit and when one does respond you don't want to lose it because a dull hook cannot penetrate its tough jaw. Many years ago, I took part in a three-day musky tournament in Minnesota and in the evenings I noticed that many of the seasoned competitiors whipped out file or sharpening stone before turning in.</p>
        <p>When replacing a lure's hooks, it is wise to duplicate their size and style. Any departure from this may result in the lure's action being spoiled. One exception would be with so-called popping plugs used when surfcasting for bluefish. Such poppers are almost always rigged with one treble hook.</p>
        <p>A bluefish slashing at a popping plug is probably more often hooked with a treble - rather than a single -hook, but the treble is much more difficult to remove from a beached fish. There are many occasions when a bluefish blitz lasts less than 20 minutes, and if one wants fish for family, friends and freezer, a single hook is the best bet. That is why I have put single hooks - at least two sizes larger than the original trebles - on half of my bluefish poppers. The larger single hook weighs no more than the original treble, and, being stronger, is also less likely to bend and pull free.</p>
