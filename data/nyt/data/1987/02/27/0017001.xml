        <p>LEAD: The management group seeking to acquire Viacom International Inc. countered a competing bid yesterday by raising its offer to about $49 a share in cash and securities, or a total of $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>The management group seeking to acquire Viacom International Inc. countered a competing bid yesterday by raising its offer to about $49 a share in cash and securities, or a total of $3.2 billion.</p>
        <p>The new offer appears to match roughly the increased cash and securities bid made earlier this week by the investor Sumner M. Redstone, who already owns 19.6 percent of Viacom's common stock through his Arsenal Holdings Inc.</p>
        <p>Under its revised bid, the management group - formally established as MCV Holdings Inc. - said that for each share of Viacom it would pay $38.50 a share in cash, exchangeable preferred stock with an expected market value of $8 and convertible preferred stock with an estimated market value of $2.50. It added that financing for the transaction had been arranged.</p>
        <p>MCV said its new offer was conditioned on Viacom's using its best efforts to send the proposal to stockholders. The offer will expire at 9 A.M. Monday.</p>
        <p>Viacom said a special committee of its board would review the new bid. The board had earlier agreed to accept MCV's previous offer, which had been valued as high as $47 a share. The board has not replied to Mr. Redstone's latest offer.</p>
        <p>One arbitrager following Viacom, who requested anonymity, called the new management offer ''a legitimate counterproposal.'' He added that it would put pressure on Mr. Redstone to make a tender or raise his offer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redstone, who operates a chain of theaters through his National Amusements Inc., is already the largest shareholder in Viacom, which has interests in cable and broadcast television and distributes such programs as ''The Cosby Show.''</p>
        <p>Separately, Viacom said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings fell almost 92 percent, to $700,000, or 2 cents a share, from $8.3 million, or 22 cents a share, in the 1985 quarter. Revenues, however, rose almost 35 percent, to $246.3 million, from $182.7 million. It attributed the decline to interest costs associated with its acquisition of outstanding stakes in Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc. and MTV Networks Inc.</p>
        <p>For the full year, the company said it lost $9.9 million, in contrast to earnings of $37 million, or $1.09 a share, in 1985. Revenues more than doubled, to $919.2 million, from $444.1 million.</p>
