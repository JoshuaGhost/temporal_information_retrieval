        <p>LEAD: Kyung Wha Chung, who is currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Leventritt Prize that boosted her into the big-league concert circuit, returned to Avery Fisher Hall yesterday afternoon for a recital with the pianist Jonathan Feldman, a recital that reached its high point in a beautifully accomplished performance of Bartok's Second Violin Sonata.</p>
        <p>Kyung Wha Chung, who is currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Leventritt Prize that boosted her into the big-league concert circuit, returned to Avery Fisher Hall yesterday afternoon for a recital with the pianist Jonathan Feldman, a recital that reached its high point in a beautifully accomplished performance of Bartok's Second Violin Sonata. Miss Chung's pinpoint accuracy, rhythmic sharpness and zest for vigorous attack found their counterparts in the work's agitated pages. To the rare beauties of its quiet, exploratory passages she and Mr. Feldman brought sensitive ears and responsive techniques.</p>
        <p>Though Miss Chung's Beethoven (Op. 12, No. 2) and Strauss sonatas benefited from similarly energetic and precise performances, they were somewhat less satisfying - partly because the exactitude of rhythm, and of the careful departures from it, sometimes seemed to get in the way of spontaneous flow. Miss Chung's tone, with its relatively narrow vibrato and sweet quality, is well-suited to what one thinks of as ''songful'' playing, but her impulses with a melody are not quite along those lines. Still, there was variety in the phrasing and bow pressure; these were far from being featureless, uninflected performances.</p>
        <p>The program ended with short pieces by Elgar and Brahms (the latter arranged by Brahms's violinist friend Joseph Joachim). Here, too, there was a certain sense of calculation in the ''liberties'' the violinist took, but Miss Chung's vigor and splendid technique carried the day.</p>
