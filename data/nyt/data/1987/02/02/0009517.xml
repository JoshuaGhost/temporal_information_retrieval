        <p>LEAD: Donald McGauchie, a third-generation Australian wheat farmer, raced damaging summer rain as he harvested this season's crop on the sun-bleached plains here. But it is not the rain that is the cause of most of his displeasure these days: it is the United States.</p>
        <p>Donald McGauchie, a third-generation Australian wheat farmer, raced damaging summer rain as he harvested this season's crop on the sun-bleached plains here. But it is not the rain that is the cause of most of his displeasure these days: it is the United States.</p>
        <p>Like many of this nation's 170,000 farmers, Mr. McGauchie thinks America - this nation's most powerful and trusted ally - is responsible for the poor price Australian farmers are receiving for their wheat.</p>
        <p>The economic problems of the Australian wheat farmer, the traditional conservative backbone of his country, have spilled into the political arena. Farmers, who have been one of the alliance's most stalwart supporters, are raising questions about the nature of Australian-American ties. Those doubts are surfacing as the United States faces changes in the region, including a breach with New Zealand and efforts to declare the Pacific a nuclear-free zone. Skepticism Is Growing</p>
        <p>Nobody is seriously talking of closing the United States military bases in Australia. But a growing skepticism is being expressed, especially among younger farmers.</p>
        <p>Simply put, Australian farmers, who are only minimally subsidized by their Government, believe their livelihoods are being threatened as the United States offers to sell its heavily subsidized wheat surpluses at low prices. There was particular bitterness here when the Reagan Administration, before the American Congressional elections last year, proposed selling wheat at a cut-rate price to the Soviet Union, which is Australia's biggest wheat customer.</p>
        <p>''It was always assumed in this country that if there was a fuss, the Americans would come to our aid,'' Mr. McGauchie said during a break from the harvest on his 14,000-acre property 150 miles northwest of Melbourne. ''Good alliances are built on trust, and this sort of thing undermines that trust, and among those who have been strongest in that trust. The feeling is, if they've done this to us, what will they do to us on some other issue?'</p>
        <p>''If we had a ding-dong row with Mr. Suharto,'' he added, in a reference to the leader of Indonesia, Australia's northern neighbor, ''would there be support from the United States?'' Vulnerable on Prices</p>
        <p>Wheat is critical to the Australian economy. Because of the small domestic market in Australia - there are only 15 million people in a continent the size of the United States - 80 percent of the annual crop is exported, leaving Australia, despite its high-quality wheat, vulnerable to world prices.</p>
        <p>Much as Americans complain that their manufactured goods are at a disadvantage to Japanese products because of help from Tokyo, so Australian farmers believe they are placed in an unfair position by Washington's subsidies, which they contend shield American farmers from world competition.</p>
        <p>Australian farm organizations complain that since the enactment of the export enhancement program by Congress last year, American farmers receive a double subsidy: one to grow the wheat and another to sell the vast surpluses.</p>
        <p>After three successive American actions - the drop of the loan rate to American farmers, the passage of the export program and the offer to the Soviet Union - the price of Australian wheat dropped by one third in eight months, according to Don Wilkinson, an executive of the New South Wales Farmers' Association. Diplomatic Moves</p>
        <p>The United States is not ignoring the barrage of criticism here. It sent James Parker from the Department of Agriculture to be agricultural counselor at the American Embassy in Canberra. For the last six months, Mr. Parker has been crisscrossing the country listening, as he puts it, to Australian farmers ''whinge'' (the Australian term for complain) about the American farm subsidies. He tells them, he said, that they are choosing the wrong target.</p>
        <p>''They think that if the American farm bill folded tomorrow, everything would be all right,'' said Mr. Parker, in a telephone interview from Canberra. ''I say, where were they when the world price was $150 a ton and these programs were in place?''</p>
        <p>The real cause for a drop in wheat prices, Mr. Parker said he tells the farmers, is the 20 percent cut in world demand, precipitated by cutbacks in wheat imports by the Soviet Union and Brazil.</p>
        <p>Australia's farmers are unimpressed by Mr. Parker's thesis, said Mr. McGauchie. ''The farmers know they can't argue against him, he's too smart,'' Mr. McGauchie said. ''They ignore him. They know they're not going to change his mind, and he's not going to change theirs.'' Some Government Aid</p>
        <p>The Australian wheat farmer gets some help from the Government in the form of indirect subsidies on fertilizers and fuel. He is also guaranteed a minimum price for his grain by the Australian Wheat Board, the marketer of all Australian wheat.</p>
        <p>In Cootamundra, a wheat and wool-growing region 200 miles southwest of Sydney, Ian McClintock, a successful farmer whose forebears settled on his land in the last century, said he was perplexed by last year's proposed sale of wheat to the Soviet Union by the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>''It just seems the height of hypocrisy to be selling the subsidized wheat to America's arch-enemy,'' Mr. McClintock said. ''If any country dumps wheat, they are transferring wealth from their country to somebody else's country. To be transferring wealth from America to Russia is horrendous, ludicrous and hypocritical.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McClintock, 52 years old, is also puzzled by the American taxpayer's tolerance of the cost of agricultural subsidies. ''The last farm bill cost the American taxpayers $30 billion,'' he said with some bemusement. ''That represents one-fifth of the American deficit.'' An 'Independent Lot'</p>
        <p>With growing numbers of wheat farmers facing bankruptcy, the idea of direct subsidies has been raised. But it was dismissed at a recent conference of the National Farmer's Federation, the leading farmers' organization.</p>
        <p>''We're a cussedly independent lot,'' said Milton Taylor, a longtime member of the Wheat Board, and wheat grower in Henty, near the Australian capital, Canberra. ''We don't want the Government involved. Every time the politicians get involved, they stuff it up. Give us a decent break, and we'll be all right. Just meet us on an even footing.''</p>
        <p>Realistically, the farmers also know the Australian treasury could not afford long-term American-style direct subsidies.</p>
        <p>The frustration of the farmers is compounded by the knowledge that Australia has little clout on the world scene. ''We have very few weapons, that's why the base issue keeps coming up,'' Mr. McClintock said.</p>
        <p>Moral persuasion, said Mr. McGauchie, was about all the Australians could use. To that end, the National Farmer's Federation is opening an office in Washington with the help of a $15 million ''fighting fund'' raised last year.</p>
        <p>Among other duties, the Washington office will try to enlighten American taxpayers about a few facts. ''We want to identify,'' Mr. McGauchie said, ''what the subsidies cost the average American citizen.''  INTERNATIONAL REPORT</p>
