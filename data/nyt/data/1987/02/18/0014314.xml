        <p>LEAD: HE was a consummate politician who denied ever being political. He was also a brilliant orator who publicly stood for a saintly humanism while secretly pulling strings to undermine radical opponents with whom he emotionally sympathized.

        <p>HE was a consummate politician who denied ever being political. He was also a brilliant orator who publicly stood for a saintly humanism while secretly pulling strings to undermine radical opponents with whom he emotionally sympathized. Those are the complex, double-edged portraits of Booker T. Washington presented by two gripping new plays that have recently opened in celebration of Black History Month.</p>
        <p>Wesley Brown's ''Boogie Woogie and Booker T.,'' at the New Federal Theater, and J. Howard Holland's ''Cast Me Down,'' at Theater Four, share the same central character and the same ambivalent attitude toward the charismatic black leader and educator who upheld separate but equal status for blacks and whites during the Reconstruction. But the two plays also complement each other by being set at different times and by adopting different tones to address urgent, ongoing issues of race, politics and moral philosophy.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Brown's more sophisticated ''Boogie Woogie,'' the evolution of jazz piano playing at the turn of the century becomes a metaphor for the black liberation movement and the mysterious process by which history anoints new leaders and leaves behind old ones. While attempting to cover a secret 1904 summit conference of black leaders in an office at Carnegie Hall, Thaddeus Stewart (Ruben S. Hudson), an ambitious, young reporter for The New York Age, encounters a veteran ragtime pianist named Butterfingers McCann (John McCallum). In scenes that shift back and forth between the summit meeting and the reporter's dialogues with the aging musician, events at the conference parallel the personal history that the pianist relates.</p>
        <p>The story of how Butterfingers bestowed his knowledge on a protege who, with scant gratitude, went on to supersede him as the pre-eminent New Orleans keyboardist is re-enacted politically at the conference where the young black leaders - William Monroe Trotter (Cortez Nance Jr.), Ida B. Wells (La Tanya Richardson), W. E. B. Du Bois (Nick Smith) - contemptuously spurn the philosophy of accommodation that has made Booker T. Washington (Charles Dumas) a hallowed American figure. In a series of biting charges and rebuttals, the imperiously soft-spoken Washington responds to a brash, often insulting inquisition with condescending evasions and ultimately with threats and reprisals. As the seeds of the modern civil-rights movement are sown, the reigning deity of black liberation stands on the verge of eclipse.</p>
        <p>''Boogie Woogie and Booker T.'' is very well acted, with Mr. Dumas's Booker T. Washington exuding an ominously magisterial command. Marie Thomas, as his only ally, the patrician Mary Church Terrell, and Miss Richardson as Ida B. Wells are outstanding as adversaries from opposite sides of the tracks engaged in venomous combat. Confidently directed by A. Dean Irby, Mr. Brown's drama is more than a well-wrought history play. It meditates clearheadedly on the nature of power and succession as it examines the continuing tragedy of racism with a burning, questioning fervor.</p>
        <p>''Cast Me Down'' is both more passionate and less polished than ''Boogie Woogie and Booker T.'' Mr. Holland's play depicts the ongoing ideological battle between Booker T. Washington (Eldon Bullock) and T. Thomas Fortune (Marcus Naylor), the radical black journalist and founder of The New York Age. As the play begins in 1901, the journalist has stolen into the educator's office at the Tuskegee Institute with the intention of killing him.</p>
        <p>Told in flashback, this ''chronicle of a crackerman'' (as Mr. Fortune sarcastically calls his story) portrays Booker T. Washington as a willing pawn of the white power structure, suppressing his radical sympathies in order to remain in the good graces of Samuel Chapman Armstrong, his white mentor and surrogate father.</p>
        <p>The play is structured as a dramatic pageant that covers the 10 years leading up to the fictitious assassination plan. At the same time, it offers a running ideological debate that interweaves swatches of the educator's inspirational oratory with the incendiary reflections of Mr. Fortune, who is driven half-mad by the tide of lynchings and Jim Crow legislation sweeping the South. General Armstrong (Shannon Baker) is depicted as a stern, sinister puppeteer piously manipulating his pupil's public deportment. Mr. Holland gradually escalates the drama's tone of indignation, which reaches an anguished crescendo in its graphic description of the butchery of a civil-rights attorney, Thomas Ferris, at the hands of a lynch mob.</p>
        <p>''Cast Me Down'' is flawed with verbal anachronisms. Words like ''life style'' and ''paranoid'' hadn't been coined in Booker T. Washington's time. But the major weakness in the production, directed by Susan Watson Turner, is Mr. Bullock's Booker T. Washington. Played as a stuffy, mild-mannered bureaucrat, he is simply no match for Mr. Naylor's wild-eyed, fulminating T. Thomas Fortune.
