        <p>JACOB RABINOW, 77, an electrical engineer, works as a part-time consultant to the National Bureau of Standards, which sets official standards for all units of scientific measurement. But he spends most of his time improving hinges or locks or ''just doing something in my head.'' Among his inventions are the automatic regulator once used in car clocks, the letter-sorting machine used by the United States Postal Service, an improved reading machine that digitizes printed characters for use in computers and the ''straight line'' phonograph, which replaces the traditional swinging arm with a system that produces better sound.</p>
        <p>There could have been more. ''I keep nine volumes of notes, with more than 2,000 ideas,'' he told the conference. ''I invent a lot of things and throw half of them away.''</p>
        <p>By most measures, Mr. Rabinow seems a happy man. He has the leisure to invent things on a whim or because a friend wants something, like a device he recently invented, which allows one to read the label on a phonograph record while it is turning. ''It's a challenge to make a record stand still,'' he said. He gets genuine satisfaction from a good invention, his own or someone else's. ''I believe inventions are an art form,'' he said. ''I can look at an invention and say 'it's gorgeous, it's elegant.' '' He toyed with a nut-threader, a screw that cuts threads in nuts and then lets the nuts drop on to a U-shaped bar. ''The first time I saw this, I said, 'my God, this is so cute. This is beautiful.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rabinow's travails as a businessman may be a lesson to other would-be Edisons. Although many of his ideas have found their way to market, he said, ''my inventions get changed all the time, usually for the worse.'' Nor are they always lucrative. Mr. Rabinow made a lot of money when he sold his reading machines to the Control Data Corporation. But he said that he lost it all when, because there were no corporate takers, he tried to market his phonograph himself. By the time Bang &amp; Olufson, the Danish phonograph-equipment maker, began to sell the invention, he says, his patent had expired. Nor could he peddle his other phonograph patent, for a device that plays both sides of a record without flipping it. Sharp Electronics eventually came out with a version of the device, he said, ''but now people are buying the compact disk player. Which is very cute.''</p>
        <p>Life is even harder for inventors these days, in Mr. Rabinow's view. Wall Street is favoring a handful of fashionable technologies, such as biogenetics, at the expense of others. Companies are larger and more resistant to change, as well as less impressed by inventions that may have little, if any, effect on the bottom line. ''Now, whoever buys a patent, you have to throw stardust in their eyes,'' he said. ''The chief executive today has no interest in long-range planning. Invention is not supported by people who look at quarterly reports.''  NOTES FROM AN INVENTORS CONVENTION</p>
