        <p>LEAD: A FEW DAYS AFTER Andrei D. Sakharov was released from internal exile in Gorky last December, the 65-year-old theoretical physicist and human-rights activist sat in his Moscow apartment, bundled in an American warm-up jacket, and proposed a modest litmus test of the liberalization ostensibly taking place in Soviet society.</p>
        <p>A FEW DAYS AFTER Andrei D. Sakharov was released from internal exile in Gorky last December, the 65-year-old theoretical physicist and human-rights activist sat in his Moscow apartment, bundled in an American warm-up jacket, and proposed a modest litmus test of the liberalization ostensibly taking place in Soviet society.</p>
        <p>Reading from a penciled list, Sakharov recounted to a group of Western reporters the cases of 14 men confined in Soviet prisons, labor camps and psychiatric hospitals for expressing their political or religious beliefs. He called on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to free them.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union's most prominent dissenter had already put his challenge to Gorbachev personally, when the Soviet leader telephoned to tell Sakharov that he could return, after nearly seven years, to Moscow.</p>
        <p>''I begged him to turn his attention to this issue,'' Sahkarov recalled, ''because it is of extreme importance for the authority of our country and for international trust, for you, personally, Mikhail Sergeyovich, and for the success of all your undertakings.'' .</p>
        <p>On the telephone, Gorbachev was noncommittal. But a few weeks later, families of several prisoners on Sakharov's list began to receive encouraging news. Serafim Yevsyukov, a former navigator for the Soviet airline Aeroflot, committed to a mental hospital for his persistent requests to emigrate, was released on Jan. 24. The wives of Anatoly Koryagin and Sergei Khodorovich, two activists in the battered Soviet campaign for human rights, were told the men would be freed from prison on the condition they leave the country. On Feb. 6, an ailing dissident, Yuri Shikhanovich, was unexpectedly sent home from a labor camp. At least three others have been transferred to prisons in cities closer to their homes, and relatives have been told they might be freed any day.</p>
        <p>Senior Soviet officials say that authorities have begun a systematic review of convictions handed down for ''anti-Soviet'' activities. And Gorbachev himself has called for new laws, as yet only roughly defined, to protect freedom of expression, create avenues of judicial appeal and free the court system of political influence.</p>
        <p>Gorbachev's intentions - not to mention his chances of success - are matters for speculation. At the least, he seems determined to alleviate a source of international pressure and embarrassment. Some optimistic analysts think that Gorbachev, a lawyer by training, has another pragmatic motive - a desire to unleash some of the popular initiative that is stifled by the arbitrary application of police power so vividly reflected in the cases Sakharov enumerated.</p>
        <p>The people on Sakharov's list do not constitute a ''movement.'' If they did not live in a society where it is a serious crime to express certain ideas -the Russian word for dissident is inakomyslyashchi, ''differently minded'' - they would not even make up a coherent interest group. Their numbers include an Estonian nationalist, a Hebrew teacher, an Orthodox Christian and a Eurocommunist.</p>
        <p>Sakharov refers to them as members of a ''karass,'' a word invented by novelist Kurt Vonnegut in ''Cat's Cradle'' to describe teams of people who ''do God's will without ever discovering what they're doing.'' Sakharov's karass consists of people who refuse to act afraid, though they live in a society where fear is the norm.</p>
        <p>They are, Sakharov stresses, only a sampling.</p>
        <p>An annual directory of Soviet political prisoners, published in Munich by Cronid Lubarsky, an emigre astronomer, and passed secretly among dissidents like a sorrowful high school yearbook, contains the biographies and pictures of 706 men and 49 women now serving time. Lubarsky estimates there are another 3,000 such ''prisoners of conscience'' about whom he lacks detailed information. Natan Sharansky, a Jewish dissident who emigrated to Israel last year, contends the number exceeds 10,000. Gorbachev told a French interviewer last year that the number of prisoners serving time for ''anti-Soviet activities'' is fewer than 200.</p>
        <p>The numbers are not really Sakharov's point. Dissidents and their sympathizers have always been a tiny, unpopular minority in the Soviet Union, the prisoners among them a sad subset. But the fact that the Soviet state uses its power to condemn poets and mathematicians to hard labor for signing appeals, translating unauthorized books, publishing crude samizdat journals of unofficial thinking, or requesting permission to leave the country, is a crushing check on whatever impulse toward freedom survives in a fearful populace.</p>
        <p>The accounts that follow come from interviews with relatives and friends, from human-rights activists in Moscow and in the West, and from accounts published by Western journalists and Soviet emigres. These are not always the most cold-eyed sources, but they are often the only sources. The Soviet Foreign Ministry initially promised to make available an official who could speak knowledgably about the cases, but then said it did not know when, if ever, the interview could be arranged.</p>
        <p>This is Sakharov's list.  YURI SHIKHANOVICH</p>
        <p>THIS IS OUR CLOSEST friend, this is a person who will be in our apartment every day now that he is free,'' says Yelena Bonner, Sakharov's wife, who shared her husband's exile for two years. Shikhanovich, who had been at the Sakharovs' side in many of the human-rights campaigns of the past two decades, was unexpectedly freed from a labor camp on Feb. 6 after serving three years of a 10-year term.</p>
        <p>He is a respected academic, a specialist in mathematical linguistics and author of a mathematics textbook that has been translated into several languages.</p>
        <p>His daughter, Katya, says that Shikhanovich was expelled from his teaching job for signing a 1968 letter in defense of Aleksandr Yesenin-Volpin, a distinguished mathematician who had been put in a psychiatric ward for writing poetry the Government found offensive.</p>
        <p>For his contributions to the most important underground human-rights journal, the Chronicle of Current Events, Shikhanovich was arrested in 1973, diagnosed as having schizophrenic tendencies and confined to a mental hospital. Sakharov and Bonner mustered Western support, and two years later obtained his release.</p>
        <p>Shikanovich was rearrested when a police search of Bonner's apartment turned up pages of the next issue of Chronicle with corrections in Shikhanovich's handwriting.</p>
        <p>Bonner says that despite being partially blind and almost deaf, Shikhanovich was assigned to cleaning presses in a camp workshop in Perm, at the foothills of the Ural Mountains. Last August, his right hand was caught in a machine, and three of his fingers were severed. Just prior to his release, his family had received a letter saying he had been hospitalized, with no further explanation. Details of his condition at the time of his release were not immediately known.  GENRIKH O. ALTUNYAN</p>
        <p>ALTUNYAN WAS PART OF the first serious attempt to give shape to the human-rights campaign in the Soviet Union. In May 1969, he and 14 others, identifying themselves as the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights, signed an open appeal to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The appeal referred to the trials of political dissidents and to the then little-known use of psychiatric hospitals to punish people of dissenting viewpoints.</p>
        <p>Within six months, most of the group had been imprisoned, banished into exile or forced to emigrate. Altunyan, a radio engineer from the Ukraine, served three years in a labor camp under Article 190 of the Russian criminal code - ''defaming the Soviet State.''</p>
        <p>When the Government stepped up its efforts to dismember the human-rights movement before the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Altunyan was arrested again under the other statute most commonly applied to dissenters, Article 70 - ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.''</p>
        <p>According to a clandestine record of his trial, witnesses testified that in private conversations Altunyan had criticized the Soviet occupations of Czechoslovakia and Mongolia, that he had described a friend confined in a psychiatric hospital as a political prisoner, that he had said unkind things about the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>It was enough for the maximum sentence under Article 70: seven years in a labor camp and five years of internal exile. ''They really had nothing on him, says Ludmilla Alexeyeva, who worked on various underground journals before being forced to emigrate to the United States in 1977. ''I think they were simply afraid that if Genrikh remained free, he was the sort of man who could be the center of a new dissident circle.''</p>
        <p>The dissident grapevine reported in early February that Altunyan had been transferred from a labor camp to a prison in Kharkov in the eastern Ukraine and would be released soon.  ANATOLY KORYAGIN</p>
        <p>KORYAGIN, A PSYCHIATRIST, was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp and five years of internal exile for smuggling reports to the West based on his work as an unpaid consultant to the Working Commission for the Investigation of the Abuse of Psychiatry for Political Purposes.</p>
        <p>''All the people I examined had joined the ranks of the mentally ill because they did or said things which in our country are considered anti-Soviet,'' he wrote in a report smuggled to the British medical magazine Lancet in 1981. His reports contributed to international condemnation of the Soviet abuses of psychiatry.</p>
        <p>In late January, Sakharov and other dissident sources said that Koryagin had been transferred to a prison in his home city of Kharkov and offered freedom on the condition he leave the country. Friends who had talked to his wife, Galina, said she had not been allowed to see her husband, and did not know if he was willing to emigrate. Koryagin is said to be extremely ill from his years in one of the harshest labor camps.  IOSIF Z. BEGUN</p>
        <p>AS A BOY, BEGUN ATTENDED Hebrew school. As an adult, he became enthralled by Jewish history and culture. Ludmilla Alexeyeva says he was the first person she ever saw who braved popular anti-Semitism by wearing a yarmulke in Moscow. When he applied to emigrate to Israel in 1971, he was dismissed from his job as an electrical engineer, and later from a job as a night watchman. He gave private Hebrew lessons, but that is not recognized as legitimate employment in the Soviet Union. He was arrested for ''parasitism,'' the crime of unemployment, and was exiled for two years to a Siberian gold-mining town eight time zones from his family in Moscow.</p>
        <p>After he attended a demonstration against the trial of dissident Yuri Orlov in 1978, Begun was arrested again and exiled for three years, because his internal passport did not permit him to be in Moscow.</p>
        <p>His third arrest was in 1983, for writing and compiling articles on Jewish culture and history, including vivid accusations of official persecution of Jews in the Soviet Union. At Chistopol prison in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Republic, his job is to weave string bags for the storage of fruits and vegetables.</p>
        <p>His wife, Ina, and son, Boris, have not been allowed to see him since August 1985. When his wife tried to visit her husband in January, she was told that he was in an isolation ward for failing to produce his quota of eight bags per day.</p>
        <p>Recently, Begun wrote to his son that he had read with interest about the publication of ''Heritage,'' a new collection of articles on Russian culture.</p>
        <p>''I remember that some years ago there was an analogous publication called 'Our Heritage,' but it didn't receive such widespread acceptance,'' he noted, joking past the prison censors. ''Our Heritage'' was a collection of Begun's articles on Jewish culture cited in his indictment as ''anti-Communist.''  VLADIMIR L. GERSHUNI</p>
        <p>GERSHUNI WAS FIRST ARRESTED in 1949, when he was a 19-year-old student, for passing out leaflets accusing Stalin of betraying the Revolution. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who encountered him at a transit prison camp in 1950, recalls him in ''The Gulag Archipelago'' as a firebrand who turned on a prison trusty, shouting, ''We're re-vo-lu-tion-aries again now! Against the Soviet state this time.''</p>
        <p>Released after 10 years, Gershuni worked as a bricklayer and contributed witty, angry articles to underground journals, for which he was confined in a psychiatric hospital for five years.</p>
        <p>In 1979, when a group of Muscovites began publishing Quest, an underground journal intended as a forum for those seeking ''a way out of our general misfortune,'' Gershuni was one of those whose names appeared on the title page as editors. That earned him another, but shorter, stay in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
        <p>Freed again, he joined a group seeking to organize an unofficial alternative to the state-controlled unions. The group had ambitious plans to set up mutual-aid funds, cooperative housing, kindergartens and barter groups, but succeeded only in producing an informational bulletin critical of Soviet work laws and worker benefits. For his efforts, he was arrested in 1982.</p>
        <p>Gershuni was last reported in a psychiatric hospital in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan. The length of his sentence and his condition are unknown.  MART NIKLUS</p>
        <p>NIKLUS, AN ORNITHOLOGIST, was among 45 Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians who signed an open declaration demanding independence for the Baltic states on Aug. 23, 1979, the 40th anniversary of Stalin's secret protocol with Hitler giving Soviet authorities a sphere of influence in the Baltics.</p>
        <p>Estonia had enjoyed 21 years of idependence before it was annexed into the Soviet empire in 1940. The memory lingers. Niklus's trial represented one of the more dramatic efforts by Soviet authorities to prevent that memory from blossoming into a seriious separatist movement. For signing the declaration, and for statements condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and for supporting a boycott of the Moscow Olympics, Niklus was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp plus five years in exile.</p>
        <p>In a letter smuggled out of the camp, Niklus said he had been assigned to a barracks containing 48 prisoners and 32 bunks: ''I arranged myself on the floor, in semi-darkness under the radiator, in the company of many well-fed cockroaches.''  SERGEI D. KHODOROVICH</p>
        <p>KHODOROVICH, A former computer programmer, was director of the Russian Fund to Aid Political Prisoners, an underground aid society that helped families of prisoners buy plane tickets to visit the remote labor camps, provided child support, food parcels and occasionally underwrote legal fees for political prisoners.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Khodorovich was convicted on the testimony of the fund's Leningrad manager, Valery Repin, who, after 15 months in solitary confinement, had repented on national television and denounced the fund as a Central Intelligence Agency front. Khodorovich was sentenced to three years in a labor camp, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Last April, his term was extended for ''malicious disobedience.''</p>
        <p>On Jan. 28, his wife, Tatyana, was summoned by the K.G.B. and told she had two days to accept an offer: agree to leave the country, and her husband would be freed. She said the prospect of being wrenched from their native country and relatives was ''terrifying,'' but less so than the prospect of her husband dying in a labor camp. She and her husband have decided to leave.  THE YEVSYUKOVS</p>
        <p>SERAFIM YEVSYUKOV, a former Aeroflot navigator committed to a mental hospital after trying to emigrate, was the first prisoner on Sakharov's list to be freed. He was released on Jan. 24, weak and dazed from six months of almost daily injections with powerful tranquilizers.</p>
        <p>He has not been allowed to emigrate, and authorities have warned him that he could be swiftly returned to the mental ward.</p>
        <p>His 24-year-old son, also named Serafim, remains in a Siberian labor camp to which he was sentenced two times for refusing the draft. He told authorities he would not serve in the army of a country where he did not want to live.</p>
        <p>The elder Yevsyukov and his daughter, Ludmilla, who is 26, said their family's determination to leave has been hardened. ''In this country, everybody's frightened,'' she says. ''Everybody's a slave.''  SERGEI GRIGORYANTS</p>
        <p>GRIGORYANTS WAS a journalist and literary critic, a contributor to some of Moscow's most prestigious periodicals.</p>
        <p>In 1975, he was arrested for giving an acquaintance three books by emigre writers, and for ''speculation'' connected with the sale of some paintings. He spent five years in prisons and labor camps. ''Sergei used to say that if he could forget everything he had seen in his first imprisonment, he would consider himself a coward,'' a close friend recalled recently. ''By forgetting, he would betray his fellow prisoners and his country as well.''</p>
        <p>He did not forget. In 1983, he was arrested again, for publishing an underground bulletin called ''V,'' for Vesti, or news, that reported on the trials and conditions of political prisoners. At his trial, Grigoryants lectured the court on the need to expose the moral shortcomings of Soviet society in order to put it on a democratic footing; his passionate remarks could have come from Gorbachev's speechwriter. His sentence: seven years in prison and three years of exile.</p>
        <p>In his most recent letter to his wife, Tamara, in June, Grigoryants complained of severe headaches and said he was suffering from scurvy. Authorities have insisted that he is in good health, but they have denied his wife and mother permission to visit, and have returned the parcels of food and medicine they have sent.</p>
        <p>Tamara Grigoryants says she cannot help but remember that another prominent dissident, Anatoly Marchenko, died in the same prison, Chistopol, in December, following a hunger strike.</p>
        <p>''They were close friends in Moscow before,'' she says, ''and I'm convinced that Sergei was on the hunger strike with him.''  A.I. OGORODNIKOV</p>
        <p>THE SOVIET STATE has reached an accomodation with the Russian Orthodox Church, but not with all of its estimated 40 million worshipers. The church is allowed a certain latitude - religious services and baptisms are permitted - but proselytizing and working with the poor are forbidden.</p>
        <p>Ogorodnikov is one of many Orthodox believers whose fervor does not fit into the approved arrangement. ''Our encounter with the official church, bound hand and foot, has left us alone with our problems,'' Ogorodnikov wrote in a letter smuggled from his labor camp to the West.</p>
        <p>In 1973, he was expelled from the Moscow Cinema Institute, where he was studying to be a film director, for attempting to make a movie about young people and religious faith. The following year, he and other young religious intellectuals organized a group called the Christian Seminar that met to discuss religion and philosophy and published a journal called ''The Community.''</p>
        <p>He was arrested in 1978 as a ''parasite,'' then rearrested in his labor camp near Khabarovsk for anti-Soviet propaganda and sentenced to six years hard labor plus five years in exile. In 1985, when he was due to be sent into exile, he was given an additional three years of hard labor for violating camp rules.</p>
        <p>Keston College, an institution near London that follows religious affairs in Communist countries, says it has reliable reports that Ogorodnikov has been beaten, has lost all of his teeth and is nearly blind.  MIKHAIL G. RIVKIN</p>
        <p>AS A STUDENT IN THE 1970's, Rivkin, the son of a Moscow journalist, fell in with a group of young Muscovites attracted to the writings of Western European Communists.</p>
        <p>In a journal called ''Variations,'' with a total circulation of six copies, the group asserted that since the 1917 Revolution a new ruling class had grown up in the Soviet Union. According to his mother, Inna Golubovskya, Rivkin wrote only three articles, and six months before his arrest he dropped out of the group because he felt the others were not serious-minded enough. Several members of the group were arrested in 1982; all but Rivkin eventually repented.</p>
        <p>''Misha,'' says his mother, ''is a person, with a capital P. He said he was not guilty of any crime, and in any case could not betray his friends.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Rivkin was suddenly transferred from Chistopol prison in the Tatar Republic to a cell in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. On Feb. 4, Rivkin's mother said prison authorities had told her that her son had signed a statement of some kind and would be set free in mid-February. She said he would be allowed to live and work in Moscow.  ALEXSEI SMIRNOV</p>
        <p>SMIRNOV GREW UP IN A Moscow apartment that was a sort of salon for dissidents in the 1960's. His grandfather, Alexsei Kosterin, was a well-known Russian writer who joined the Communist Party before the Revolution but later became a champion of ethnic minority groups in the Caucasus and Crimea. His mother, Yelena Kosterin, was stripped of party membership in the late 1960's for signing letters in support of Solzhenitsyn and other dissidents.</p>
        <p>Young Alexsei, a computer programmer, followed in the family tradition. He helped gather material for the Chronicle of Current Events, and later worked on the underground bulletin ''V.'' Arrested in 1982 in a crackdown on the clandestine press, he refused to cooperate with the investigators or to testify at his own trial. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment plus four years of exile.</p>
        <p>''He would not confess,'' his mother says. ''Alyosha is the sort of person who believes what Bulgakov wrote in 'The Master and Margarita,' 'The worst sin is cowardice.' ''</p>
        <p>His mother; his wife, Ludmilla, and his 14-year-old son, Sergei, have not been allowed to see him since August.</p>
        <p>Smirnov's mother reported early in February that she had learned that her son had been moved to Lefortovo prison in Moscow, and had been offered his freedom if he would sign a statement. She did not know what the statment said, or whether he would sign it, but said she was told that if he refused he would return to Chistopol on Feb. 20.  MERAB KOSTAVA</p>
        <p>KOSTAVA WAS A MUSIC teacher in Tbilisi, the capital of the Republic of Georgia, and a central figure in the Georgian human-rights movement. In 1974, together with two friends, he organized the Georgia chapter of the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights, and three years later was a founder of the Georgian Helsinki Watch Committee, formed to monitor Soviet compliance with international human-rights agreements.</p>
        <p>He was arrested in 1977 and charged with ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'' for having translated a number of works into Georgian, including Sakharov's book ''My Country and the World,'' and an article by Yuri Orlov, ''Is Socialism of a Non-Totalitarian Kind Possible?''</p>
        <p>His sentence has been extended twice for disobeying camp orders, and he is now reportedly confined in a criminal labor camp near Ksani in Georgia. In 1984, his 24-year-old son Irakliy was found hanged in his home in what authorities said was a suicide. Friends charge the circumstances were suspicious.</p>
        <p>''I think the authorities don't want to release Kostova, because they are afraid he will appear in Georgia and will be a national hero,'' says Ludmilla Alexeyava.</p>
        <p>''He is very tough, very dignified, Merab Kostava,'' says Andrei Sakharov. ''That's why they want to get even with him. Camp and prison are very difficult for people who don't compromise.''  As of this writing, the elder Yevsyukov has been released from a mental hospital and Shikhanovich, from a labor camp. Koryagin and Khodorovich are expected to be freed, provided they leave the country. At least three others are now in prisons closer to their homes.</p>
        <p>Editor's Note:</p>
        <p>An article in The Times Magazine today titled ''Sakharov's List'' describes the events that followed Andrei D. Sakharov's delivery of a list to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, citing 14 men confined by Moscow because of their political or religious views. Dr. Sakharov argued that the men should be freed.</p>
        <p>Several of those on the list were among a large group recently released. After the magazine went to press, a decree pardoned a second group and brought to 140 the overall total of those freed. A Soviet spokesman indicated that another 140 were under review.</p>
        <p>No additional prisoners on Dr. Sakharov's list have so far been released.</p>
