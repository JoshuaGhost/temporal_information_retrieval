        <p>LEAD: AS a child, Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi said, he loved to fish in Long Island Sound with his uncles, but he fears his children may never get to cherish such memories.</p>
        <p>AS a child, Representative Joseph J. DioGuardi said, he loved to fish in Long Island Sound with his uncles, but he fears his children may never get to cherish such memories.</p>
        <p>''I've always loved Long Island Sound,'' said the Republican from the county's 20th District. ''This has to be something we pass on to the future. I want my son, John, to recognize that this is the same beautiful recreational facility that I had.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. DioGuardi, who was recently named to the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, which has jurisdiction over much of the Federal work on the Sound, said that the 1,300-square-mile estuary might be permanently scarred unless the Government took steps to restore its ecological balance.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi, in an interview in his Congressional office, said preliminary reports showed that the oxygen level in western Long Island Sound was falling and that PCB's, heavy metals and other toxins had been found in the waters in increasing amounts.</p>
        <p>''It's not a signal of a healthy society that we would be doing things like this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In response to the pollution problems in the Sound, Mr. DioGuardi, who is serving his second-term in the House, said he planned to fight for a strong Federal role in the cleanup effort.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. DioGuardi appears enthusiastic about restoring the Sound, his role in determining Federal policy will be limited because he is the most junior member of the minority party on the panel.</p>
        <p>Moreover, conservation groups say his commitment to the environment is unclear. The organizations say Mr. DioGuardi is a fiscal conservative who has not demonstrated unwavering support for new conservation programs. ''As far as his votes are concerned, he's got a pretty low environmental score,'' said Linda Winter, a policy analyst with the League of Conservation Voters. In 1985, the league scored Mr. DioGuardi 33 out of a possible 100 on 12 controversial environmental votes in the House. The average among Representatives was 52 out of 100.</p>
        <p>The Merchant Marine Committee determines the scope of Federal action on the Sound, including pollution monitoring, coastal-zone management, and water-quality research. It also oversees activities of the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>A priority for Mr. DioGuardi will be to insure sustained or increased financing for the teams studying Long Island Sound. Since 1984, the Environmental Protection Agency has received $1 million a year to study the estuary and the sources of its pollution.</p>
        <p>This fiscal year, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic group each received $1 million for research on the Sound.</p>
        <p>Jo Brecker, an Environmental Protection Agency project staff member in New York City, said scientists were gathering historical and current data about the Sound that will be used to create a computer model of the estuary.</p>
        <p>Such models have been used successfully to help plan the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay, the world's largest estuary. Mr. DioGuardi and others point to this plan as a possible prototype for the effort to restore the Sound.</p>
        <p>The initial Chesapeake Bay study was begun in 1976, lasted seven years and cost $27 million. Completed in 1983, the study detailed problems in the bay and provided a blueprint for the cleanup.</p>
        <p>A management team of Federal, state and local officials was then created to refine the Chesapeake plan, after which Congress appropriated $52 million in 1985 to begin restoration. Chesapeake Bay is considered in the first phase of its restoration.</p>
        <p>''I think we have to improve upon what they've done on the Chesapeake,'' Mr. DioGuardi said, discussing the Long Island Sound effort. ''I think that we can make this an ongoing study in the sense that we don't just take one snapshot as they did in the Chesapeake Bay and then run in and try to fix it.''</p>
        <p>''I think they wasted a lot of money not knowing that a section was bad and getting better or bad and getting worse,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''I want to make sure that this is kind of a living study so we make sure we understand what's happening to the Sound and then use that money and use it properly after coming up with a strategic plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi said he would like to see a strategic plan created within five years, so that by the mid-1990's, work is under way to halt new pollution from entering the Sound.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. DioGuardi said he would closely monitor the residential and commercial developments planned for Port Chester's waterfront and for Davids Island off New Rochelle to protect the estuary from further damage.</p>
        <p>''My goal is to be sure that wherever development happens along that Sound, that it's balanced, that we don't see a lot of developers getting rich taking away the public's easements,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi and local legislators also are working to create standards for development on the Sound.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to see a wall of towers along Long Island Sound,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''That's not my vision of what the Sound should be.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups such as the Oceanic Society's Long Island Sound Task Force said they welcomed Mr. DioGuardi's addition to a group of regional lawmakers intent on cleaning up and preserving the delicate ecosystem.</p>
        <p>But some organizations have criticized the Representative for two votes he cast in 1985 on the financing of water-quality projects.</p>
        <p>During the Clean Water Act debate in July 1985, Mr. DioGuardi voted for an alternative Republican bill that would have reduced authorization of the measure to $12 billion from the proposed $18 billion.</p>
        <p>The measure would have cut $6 billion for treatment of municipal sewage and for control of ''runoff'' pollution in lakes and estuaries. Forty-four sewage treatment plants empty their waste water into the Sound.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi, through a spokesman, said he favored the $6 billion cutback because he had previously voted for reductions in defense spending and thought Congress should be consistent in its attempts to curb Federal spending.</p>
        <p>Conservation groups also criticized Mr. DioGuardi for favoring a pilot project that would have exempted 40 cities from complying with Federal standards on the removal of toxic poisons from wastewater.</p>
        <p>The League of Conservation Voters said that without national regulations, many cities and states would likely weaken their pollution rules to compete with neighboring cities for industry.</p>
        <p>Gordon Hensley, Mr. DioGuardi's spokesman, said the Congressman had voted for the pilot project because ''he wanted to give the cities the opportunity to exceed the Federal pretreatment standards.''</p>
        <p>Many environmental organizations, including such national groups as the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and the Nature Conservancy, said that Mr. DioGuardi's record and longtime support of the President's fiscal policies ran counter to environmental concerns. They added, however, that it was premature to assess his future on the committee.</p>
        <p>''I believe in what Ronald Reagan has done,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''Here's an area where the Federal Government has a rightful role - in national security and the environment. Certainly the environment ranks right up there with national security in my mind.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi said that he would use his committee assignment to help insure that Federal agencies enforce water-quality standards.</p>
        <p>''I will take a very aggressive approach to those agencies that are not doing all they can,'' he said.</p>
