        <p>LEAD: For tourists, the Rhine will always be a broad brown ribbon running through the soul of Europe. In the mountain reaches, like the region between Mainz and Coblenz, it winds through wooded hills, its banks lined with sloping vineyards and green gorges capped by turreted castles.</p>
        <p>For tourists, the Rhine will always be a broad brown ribbon running through the soul of Europe. In the mountain reaches, like the region between Mainz and Coblenz, it winds through wooded hills, its banks lined with sloping vineyards and green gorges capped by turreted castles.</p>
        <p>But there is another Rhine - long flat stretches, like the run that passes Leverkusen and the immense chemical works of Bayer, where nature gives way to industry. And there is growing concern that some of the industries that depend so heavily on the Rhine may be wearing out the river. Bargemen, businessmen, politicians and environmentalists are among those who have a stake in the Rhine's struggle to survive. But each group also has its own agenda, and it is getting increasingly difficult to reconcile the conflicting demands.</p>
        <p>The Rhine is a throbbing artery of European commerce. From Switzerland in the south to the Netherlands, more than 500 miles north, chemical plants, factories and power stations dot its shores, drinking in millions of gallons a day.</p>
        <p>It is also a critical transportation link. About 125 million tons of goods move along the river each year, although that is about a third less than the volume 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>And the Rhine still supports a fishing industry, although a shrunken one. Before World War II, Rhine salmon were a delicacy. But because of pollution, restaurants now rarely serve Rhine fish. Today, only a handful of parttime fishermen cast their nets, catching mainly the hardy eel.</p>
        <p>For millions of people in the Netherlands and West Germany, the Rhine is a prime source of drinking water, though it must be filtered and mixed with water from wells or reservoirs.</p>
        <p>German economists have devised a yardstick to measure the productivity of the Rhine against that of other great rivers, taking into account the amount of goods produced and shipped on or near its shores. By that measure, the drainage basin of the Rhine produces $5 of annual gross national product per cubic meter of its water, more than double the Danube, and five times the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>But these are troubled times for the mighty Rhine. Several recent environmental catastrophes have focused attention on the Rhine's fragility:</p>
        <p>On Nov. 1, about 30 tons of mercury and pesticides washed into the Rhine when firemen fought a blaze at a Sandoz chemical company warehouse in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Several days later, Ciba-Geigy, another Swiss chemical giant, admitted it accidently released 900 pounds of pesticide into the Rhine only hours before the Sandoz fire.</p>
        <p>In January two barges collided near Dusseldorf, dumping 540 tons of nitrogen fertilizers into the river. Shortly thereafter, a Dutch barge, the Minstreel, rammed a tanker near Krefeld, Germany, pouring 10 tons of a highly explosive benzene compound into the water.</p>
        <p>More subtle forces have been challenging the river, as well.</p>
        <p>There has been a dramatic transformation in the industrial use of the Rhine. Chemical and pharmaceutical companies, which use the river mainly as a source of water for processing, have burgeoned while mining and manufacturing companies, which use the river primarily for transportation, have shrunk. Three of Germany's biggest steelmakers have blast furnaces on the Rhine: Thyssen, Mannesmann and Krupp. But demand for their products - as well as coal and sand and gravel for construction - has declined in the face of slow growth and foreign competition, cutting revenues and employment in the shipping industry. SOME companies have managed to adapt to the changes. Franz Haniel is a shipping company that has been doing business since the 18th century in the German town of Duisburg, which sits at the point where the Rhine swallows the smaller Ruhr river. Haniel's neat gray buildings, grouped around a cobbled courtyard, reflect its prosperity. As bulk cargoes like ores declined, Haniel bought equipment needed to handle cargo containers and roll-on, roll-off ships, which carry the trailers of tractor-trailer trucks.</p>
        <p>Haniel has managed to adapt to the new facts of life on the Rhine, but the combination of shrinking tonnage and automation has put a lot of people out of work. The decline is reflected in cities like Duisburg, which, with its maze of docks and arching cranes, is Europe's largest inland port. Last year, through November, 16.8 million tons of freight and bulk goods passed through Duisburg, down from nearly 26 million tons in the comparable period in 1978. Today, roughly 30,000 people are employed in Europe's inland shipping industry, most of them along the Rhine, about 15 percent fewer than five years ago.</p>
        <p>Across the street from Haniel, signs of the changes in the shipping business are evident. The little inns where Rhine bargemen and their families used to eat and spend the night while their ships lay moored until morning, are now private homes; restaurants have closed and been converted into apartments.</p>
        <p>''Unemployment is high, young people go elsewhere to seek work,'' said Horst Krieger, an executive of Franz Haniel.</p>
        <p>To prevent a rash of bankruptcies, the Central Commission for Rhine Navigation, in Strasbourg, France, has sought to scrap excess shipping capacity, paying shippers to take older ships out of service.</p>
        <p>Shrinking the industry in an orderly manner might make sense economically, but may not be acceptable socially. In the Netherlands, for example, the Government is scrapping 500,000 tons of obsolete tonnage, but that program will eventually destroy the traditional way of life of the bargemen - ''partikuliere.''</p>
        <p>The partikuliere bid for cargoes at exchanges in cities such as Rotterdam, and then haul them up the canals and waterways that surround the Rhine. Most come from families that have been doing this for centuries, and they live most of the year on their ships with their families.</p>
        <p>They tend to have the least-efficient ships, however, and have gotten by only with the help of Government subsidies. The Government is now offering them pensions and lump sum payments to persuade them to leave the business.</p>
        <p>The growth of the chemical and pharmaceutical companies poses a different threat to Rhine life. Six of Europe's largest chemical companies have plants on the banks of the Rhine, including Ciba-Geigy in Switzerland, and Bayer and BASF in Germany. They use the Rhine both as a dump for waste water, and a source for clean water to use for cooling and as an ingredient.</p>
        <p>BASF, for example, operates an immense complex of 330 factories and plants along the river at Ludwigshafen, employing 53,000 people. Its water needs are enormous. Dietmar Kokott, the engineer in charge of its water supplies, said that the company's pumping stations suck in between 750 million and 935 million gallons of water a day. As the water in the Rhine became polluted, BASF has had to turn increasingly to well water. It now uses 10 different grades of water, from unfiltered river water for cooling to critically pure well waters, pumped up from depths of 600 feet, for sensitive pharmaceutical production.</p>
        <p>BASF has taken several steps to protect the river that it depends on so heavily. In 1970, a fire on a chemical barge not owned by the company nearly destroyed huge amounts of chemical feedstocks. Alarmed by the accident, BASF built a special harbor, with remote-controlled fire fighting equipment and floodgates that could close in case of dangerous spills. IN 1974 it completed a plant capable of treating nearly 200 million gallons. (Most of the water BASF uses is for cooling, and is returned untreated to the river.) Hoechst, the world's largest chemical concern, built a similar facility at its factory at the confluence of the Rhine and Main rivers, and Bayer built a treatment plant at Leverkusen.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power plants take a toll on the Rhine, as well. Seven now stand on the river's shores, with two more planned in Switzerland and Germany. Nuclear plants use water for cooling, discharging huge amounts of heated water into the river, which tends to raise the water temperature. Warmer water encourages the breeding of bacteria that rob the river of large amounts of oxygen, making it less habitable for other forms of life.</p>
        <p>The quality of water in the Rhine probably reached its low point about 1970; it has gradually been improving since then. In recent years, governments along the Rhine passed legislation mandating construction of water treatment plants for cities and industry. Germany strictly regulates construction of new factories along the Rhine and bars large companies already operating there from increasing the amount of river water they use. Switzerland and the Netherlands have followed suit. THE Rhine is monitored around the clock for the presence of toxic substances and increases in temperature. When the temperature rises more than 2 degrees (centigrade), the nuclear plants are ordered to cut their intake of cooling water.</p>
        <p>In January, a group of independent Swiss experts reported that the long-term effects of the Sandoz chemical spill might not be as bad as first feared. Their study indicated that the river was rapidly washing out pollution residues from the spill, and that enough small invertebrate water life and plants had survived to provide the basis for a rapid regeneration of fish and other water life.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, serious ecological problems persist. Existing water treatment methods do not filter out several dangerous pollutants - including mercury, cadmium and lead - that enter the river as byproducts of manufacturing processes. And according to Prof. Ragnar Kinzelbach, chairman of the zoology department at Darmstadt University, large amounts of nitrates from farm fertilizers sweep into the river with rainfall or seep in through ground water.</p>
        <p>While many ecologists believe that more must be done to cleanse the river, it is not clear just what action will be taken.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kokott agrees that pollution is still a problem, but argues that further improvements would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>For politicians, the river's fate is becoming an increasingly important issue. The Sandoz spill helped the Green Party in Germany increase its share of the popular vote to 8.3 percent in January's national election; it had won 5.6 percent of the vote in 1982. Chancellor Helmut Kohl last year added a Minister for the Environment to his Cabinet, and the Government has stepped up prosecution of companies that spill industrial wastes into the river.</p>
        <p>In Switzerland and the Netherlands, the major political parties quickly adopted environmental programs to forstall the growth of independent ''Green'' parties.</p>
        <p>In December, Dutch Transport Minister Neelie Smit-Kroes organized a conference of environmental ministers from Switzerland, West Germany, France and the Netherlands to work out a cleanup program. They agreed to ask the Rhine Commission for specific proposals that would enable delicate animal forms such as salmon to inhabit the river by the year 2000. But France, West Germany and Switzerland objected to other recommendations made by the Dutch, such as international inspection of suspected pollution sites, arguing that they violated national sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Some fear that even the tourist industry, which has been one bright spot in the Rhine's economy in recent years, could be imperiled if steps are not taken to clean up the river. But for years swimming has been prohibited in the Rhine's waters for fear of residual bacteria from city sewage systems. And in hot dry summers when the river's water level drops, hotel patrons and riverboat passengers complain of the stench.</p>
        <p>Will the Rhine survive? The opinions are varied, as are the proposed remedies. But if barge accidents and chemical spills have served any purpose, it has been to alert Europeans to the burden the river bears, and sound the alarm that one of Europe's main lifelines is itself badly in need of help.</p>
