        <p>THE LAST SONG OF MANUEL SENDERO By Ariel Dorfman. Translated by George R. Shivers with the author. 450 pp. New York: Viking. $18.95.</p>
        <p>THERE is a sameness to political tragedy in our time, as villains know; technology makes the horrors repeatable and reproducible, an assembly line of burns and shocks of electricity, of drowning moments and disappearances. It happens in the neighborhood: Argentina, Brazil, now Guatemala, El Salvador, and still in Chile, since 1973 in Chile. What shall the writer say? It is not strangeness that boggles the mind; the imagination stumbles over sameness, repetition leaves a man mute. For the 253d reporter on the scene it is very difficult to get a moral scoop.</p>
        <p>Contemporary political novelists, faced with a problem once limited to the depiction of happy families, seem to believe they have no choice but to abandon realism if they wish to be heard above the din of technological silence. Ariel Dorfman, a Chilean exile best known in Latin America for his investigation of the cultural and political meaning of Donald Duck, wishes to be heard. To that end he has written a novel in which the sorrows of exile and disappearance are told with jokes, puzzles and extravagances to enable the reader to feel once more a human response to modern evil.</p>
        <p>Like many novels trying to deal with phenomena that seem like madness to the rational mind, ''The Last Song of Manuel Sendero'' relies on one overarching joke on reality: ''Who could have believed that a year and a half after the child had been conceived . . . the kid had still not made its appearance into this world, was still waiting there, inside, refusing to come out?'' Yes, in Mr. Dorfman's novel the fetuses have revolted, refusing to be born until the grown-ups end political and economic oppression and permit people their human rights. Among their demands: ''Instead of freedom of prices, freedom of food must be declared,'' the stock of big weapons destroyed, and ''Everybody has to take off his clothes.'' All this to prove the sincerity of the Government's declaration of its ''own immediate dissolution.''</p>
        <p>In the hands of a political satirist, the revolt of the fetuses might have been good for a paragraph or two, a chapter at most, but Mr. Dorfman's unborn are well-rounded fetuses, capable of fear and ambition - hopeful, analytical, political, anxious and decent. And two of them are in love. Through their interuterine network the fetuses discuss the major question raised by their revolt, which is whether the world can be changed from without (that is, by their remaining unborn) or only from within (by their being born and participating in the political life of the society).</p>
        <p>The desire for light and breath cannot be overcome, however, and the rebellion begins to fail as the fetuses choose to be born, descending in the elevator that traverses the path from conception to life to death. One after another, they are born and lose the wisdom of the womb. At last, only the lovers, the son of Manuel Sendero and the sweet Pamela, are left in utero, talking over the question of being born, observing what has happened to those who preceded them. When Pamela is born, the revolt ends, for the son of Manuel Sendero loves her too much to remain in another state of being.</p>
        <p>If that were the whole story, a simple displacement, tragic and straightforwardly imagined, like Mr. Dorfman's first novel, ''Widows,'' it would be interesting, an important step forward from the relentlessly dour moralizing of that first effort, but insufficient, thin. ''The Last Song of Manuel Sendero'' is anything but thin. It refracts the life of Ariel Dorfman and his country into a dozen mirrors scattered across thousands of years. The son of Manuel Sendero is both the teller and the tale, born and unborn, fetus and grandfather. His is but one incarnation of the ethical dilemma of the exile: to punish by withholding one's love and participation or to return. It is, as the novel implies, the central question for all who have become estranged, for fetuses and singers and cartoonists and patriarchs and even for messiahs of all kinds.</p>
        <p>The problems of exile and return are confronted here most directly by two cartoonists, David and Felipe, whose realistic story weaves in and out of the tale of the fetuses. The young men plan to produce a magazine in Mexico for Latin American exiles and intellectuals. It will feature a cartoon strip about Carl Barks or Marx or Sparks, an octogenarian from the state of Washington who travels to the land of Chilex with his aged wife, Sarah. Will Sarah give birth to a child in the country that just might be the analogue of the place where the fetuses are in revolt?</p>
        <p>As the comic strip is written, the writers argue the merits of returning to Chile. The Government has told David he may come home on the condition that he give an interview to the newspapers, telling of the difficulties of life in exile. Curiously, it is not Felipe, the native Chilean, who is drawn back to his homeland, but David Wiseman, a Jew whose parents brought him out of Nazi Germany to Chile when he was 2 years old. One diaspora illuminates another.</p>
        <p>The story within the cartoon proceeds, the lives of the exiles complicate - there are children, David has a gringa wife, and there are memories of the beginning and the end of the Allende years. Carl Sparks and Sarah become another refraction of the fetuses and are in turn refracted into their biblical analogues. Ishmael and Joseph are exiles; among the fetuses who refuse to be born are a set of twins; David and Felipe, whose arguments may be the contentions within a single mind, are really deciding whether to be born. AND all the while there is the question of the last song of Manuel Sendero. Who is this man, this singer? Here is one part of one of many descriptions of him that appear in the novel: ''Manuel was real as long as the dispossessed marched beside him, as long as they held him up like a banner. It was necessary to convert the unwary, so there wouldn't be even one dissenter near him. Often, during this crusade, Manuel didn't even argue: he distributed kisses, shook hands, painted rosy pictures, and the people believed in him, more than in his ideas. He was like a fetus too, said Eduardo, when he himself was one and wanted to stop being one and the sooner the better, said Eduardo, when he recognized the danger that his companions might stay in the uterus forever, yes, like a fetus that wants everything around him to be walls of milk and of love. Manuel believed in paradise, in the Promised Land, in the Golden Age.'' The speaker is complaining about Manuel Sendero, using this description to urge the fetuses to be born; it is the analytical mind attacking the creative urge of the people as embodied in Manuel Sendero.</p>
        <p>Should we connect Manuel Sendero to Victor Jara, the enormously popular singer of the Allende period who was killed after Gen. Augusto Pinochet came to power? Who is David Wiseman and how is he different from Ariel Dorfman, who produced cartoons and popular radio and television programs during the Allende years, who cares so much about the meaning of popular culture he has not only investigated Donald Duck but also written a book, ''The Empire's Old Clothes,'' analyzing Babar the Elephant and the Lone Ranger?</p>
        <p>This Manuel Sendero, whose child refuses to be born, is mute now. Some say they heard him sing his last song and others say there never was such a song in Chile. And how is it that such an utterly preposterous complex of stories, burdened by too many echoes of the Latin American magic realists and their Yanqui cousin Thomas Pynchon, engages the reader so that David Wiseman's decision becomes important and Manuel Sendero's song achieves meaning?</p>
        <p>To agree with the politics of a novel is the beginning of affection, and I agree with this writer, who is one of those gentle leftists for whom no murder can be excused. After this moral connection has been made, after the complications of plot and puzzle have done their work, the richness of the invention breaks through the gate of reality, and the reader touches congruently the soulful imagination of Ariel Dorfman.  HOUNDED BY THE DICTATOR</p>
        <p>If the line between fantasy and reality frequently blurs in Ariel Dorfman's new novel, it is not by accident. ''There's fantasy,'' he said, ''but also the very harsh terror of reality. Writers of Latin American literature, especially my generation, are constantly being pulled between two poles: what you would call the dictatorship of everyday life and the imagination of things that might come, and might be.''</p>
        <p>This is particularly true for the Chilean author, who came to the United States in 1973, exiled after the overthrow of President Salvador Allende Gossens. He was permitted to begin visiting Chile again 10 years later (although ''after the news that I'd been assassinated in Chile came to me I decided to take a breather''). He now spends half his time there and half teaching international studies at Duke University in North Carolina. His personal trauma, and that of his country, has shaped ''The Last Song of Manuel Sendero.'' ''It's really a curse on your people and a curse on your literature,'' the 44-year-old author said in a telephone interview from Durham, N.C., ''because you can't get away from the dictator. He hounds you. In the States you're always talking about hostages being taken. Imagine what it is to have your whole country taken hostage.</p>
        <p>This has to influence your literature, and it has to influence your language.''</p>
        <p>The new novel is the result of a year and a half of ''nonstop writing'' and three to four years of planning. ''The muses - the babies - were whispering in my ear and they wouldn't let me sleep,'' he said. The result is not only fantasy and parable, but also a remedy to what he calls ''the horror at home.''</p>
        <p>''Dictatorship starts with people lying to one another, and literature starts with the hope that there is a way of getting around that. There are many ways of telling the truth. One of them is to take an orange, slice it open and see what's inside. Another is to circle around it and try to find a way of describing it that is not so direct.''  RICHARD J. MEISLIN</p>
