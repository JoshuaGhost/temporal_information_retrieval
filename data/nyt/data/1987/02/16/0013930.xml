        <p>LEAD: President Reagan was poorly prepared for the summit meeting in Iceland last October and the two-day meeting ended with ''an astonishing degree of confusion'' about potential nuclear arms control agreements, the House Armed Services Committee said today.</p>
        <p>President Reagan was poorly prepared for the summit meeting in Iceland last October and the two-day meeting ended with ''an astonishing degree of confusion'' about potential nuclear arms control agreements, the House Armed Services Committee said today.</p>
        <p>The report by the Democratic-controlled panel was sharply critical of Mr. Reagan and his Administration, citing confusion and disputes among American officials about the arms control proposals discussed and almost accepted by Mr. Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>Four months after the meeting, there is still an ''astonishing degree of confusion surrounding what actually happened,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>''With the value of hindsight, it is possible to suggest that the Reagan Administration was ill-prepared for the negotiations it participated in, and consequently, would have been ill-served had its product been accepted,'' the panel said.</p>
        <p>The report was based on a series of hearings held by the committee's defense policy panel, which listened to a variety of witnesses, including several American participants in the Reykjavik summit meeting last Oct. 11 and 12.</p>
        <p>White House officials declined to comment on the report, saying they had not yet seen it.</p>
