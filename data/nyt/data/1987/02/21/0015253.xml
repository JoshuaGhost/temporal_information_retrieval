        <p>LEAD: The Pan Am Corporation, which started its shuttle service in the Northeast Corridor just five months ago, has told its employees that it may sell the service unless it can make a profit.</p>
        <p>The Pan Am Corporation, which started its shuttle service in the Northeast Corridor just five months ago, has told its employees that it may sell the service unless it can make a profit.</p>
        <p>''Our direction from the board of directors is clear and flexible: make it profitable or get rid of it,'' C. Edward Acker, Pan Am's chairman, wrote in a six-page letter to the airline's 21,500 workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acker has suggested in the past that the shuttle could be sold, but the letter contained the strongest wording to date about the shuttle and its prospects.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a source close to Pan Am who asked not to be identified said yesterday that the shuttle was being ''shopped around,'' The source declined to identify prospective buyers or an asking price.</p>
        <p>The letter from Mr. Acker and the airline's vice chairman, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., was sent last Friday, 10 days after management rejected an offer from four of the carrier's five unions to reduce labor costs by $660 million in exchange for stock, seats on the board and promises of job security.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that at this juncture of negotiations each side was engaging in brinksmanship.</p>
        <p>''It's more saber-rattling than anything at the moment,'' one analyst said, ''but Acker's not in the greatest cash position. Right now, it's a threat to get more concessions from the unions, but if there aren't enough concessions, the threat could become real.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nobles said that with its current cost structure, ''the shuttle can still be a profitable operation, but not profitable enough to be a good, prudent investment.'' He said the shuttle might earn about $10 million in its first year, but that would be inadequate. He declined to say what profit level Pan Am had set for the shuttle.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts said that American, USAir and Delta could be interested in acquiring the shuttle operations. They said the shuttle could fetch at least $100 million, or about what Pan Am paid to buy gates and slots, lease airplanes and renovate the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport.</p>
        <p>Pan Am has faced an uphill battle for recognition as well as profitability in the fiercely contested Northeast market. Eastern's Air Shuttle still carries 7 out of every 10 shuttle passengers in the market.</p>
        <p>Pan Am filled only 25 percent of its seats in December and January, the slowest travel months, but has increased that to 35 percent this month, according to Bruce R. Nobles, president of the shuttle, which is run as a Pan Am subsidiary. It needs to fill between 45 and 50 percent to break even.</p>
