        <p>A man was killed early yesterday morning when an Amtrak train with 11 passenger cars rammed his pickup truck and dragged it a quarter of a mile, the police said.</p>
        <p>The train, the southbound ''Night Owl'' from Boston to Washington, D.C., hit the truck broadside while it was parked on the track with its lights off, said Cliff Black, an Amtrak spokesman.</p>
        <p>The driver of the truck was not immediately identified. No other injuries were reported.</p>
        <p>The train was traveling at the authorized speed of 85 m.p.h., Mr. Black said. The train, which received minimal damage, was delayed for a little more than two hours and did not cause the delay of any later trains, he said.</p>
