        <p>LEAD: SINCE 1976, Robert Sheridan has carved out a niche for himself on the national residential real estate scene by converting rental apartments into cooperatives and condominiums in such places as Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York City.</p>
        <p>SINCE 1976, Robert Sheridan has carved out a niche for himself on the national residential real estate scene by converting rental apartments into cooperatives and condominiums in such places as Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York City.</p>
        <p>But late last year his company, Robert Sheridan &amp; Partners, shifted gears when it acquired a 65-year-old, 330,000-square-foot industrial building in Hartford, a city where it has no other investments.</p>
        <p>''About a year ago we decided it was time to move in another direction,'' Mr. Sheridan said. His company, founded 11 years ago in Chicago, has sold more than $500 million worth of converted residential units.</p>
        <p>''This new acquisition may not be a particularly sexy or exciting project,'' he said. ''But we think that for the time being the best opportunities are in properties like this one because it offers a good cash flow, potential for upgrading and steady appreciation.''</p>
        <p>Robert Sheridan &amp; Partners, which hopes to acquire $100 million worth of industrial and warehouse properties in 1987, is not alone. Other residential developers are also moving into the commercial arena or have stepped up their commercial property acquisitions in the last year or so.</p>
        <p>They say they are diversifying as a hedge against the vagaries of the housing market, to tap development opportunities that their companies had bypassed before and because of their belief that the country's economic climate will favor steady, long-term investments rather than the real estate version of a grand slam.</p>
        <p>Another company on the same track is Time Equities, a New York City development concern that until the early 1980's made most of its money by buying older medium-size residences and turning them into co-ops. It has bought the former Gibraltar Building in Newark from the Prudential Insurance Company and plans to renovate the nearly empty structure and lease it to office tenants. Francis Greenburger, the principal of the company, said that in the last 18 months the value of its nonresidential investments accounted for 75 percent of its acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Yet another is Hovnanian Enterprises, one of the largest home builders on the East Coast, which built its empire by putting up simple, modestly priced condominium units. Last year it bought a seven-acre parcel in New Brunswick, N.J., that had been part of the Johnson &amp; Johnson property. The Hovnanian plans for the site are not for another residential development but for an office complex.</p>
        <p>''We want to spread the risk so that we are not entirely dependent on residential activity,'' said Ara Hovnanian, the 30-year-old son of Kevork Hovnanian, who started building housing projects in 1964. ''In some undeveloped areas, where we have gone in and built, say, 2,000 units, we have created the opportunity for commercial projects like shopping centers or mini-warehouses and then watched other companies put them up. Now we want to take advantage of those situations.''</p>
        <p>For the time being the Hovnanians plan to put most of their commercial property development dollars into a new office project, but Robert Sheridan will specifically bypass standard office investments.</p>
        <p>''From what we see, the current office market overhang will be absorbed slowly,'' he said, ''because in most regions the construction boom was driven not by a demand for space but by money that individuals and institutions wanted to invest.''</p>
        <p>The Sheridan firm chose to begin its commercial real estate activity in Hartford because of that city's healthy economy and its exceptionally low commercial vacancy rate.</p>
        <p>The company's first acquisition reflects its goal: a portfolio of slow-growing industrial investments.</p>
        <p>The Hartford building, a multitenanted facility built in 1922 for the Fuller Brush Company, is situated at 3580 Main Street near Interstate 91 in the northeast section of the city.</p>
        <p>The building's tenants occupy 170,000 square feet of space with light manufacturing, warehouse and secondary office operations.</p>
        <p>In addition to being on major transportation routes, the building has a 500-space parking lot and is in an enterprise zone that offers benefits to owners of industrial properties. Over time, the company plans to upgrade the building and convert its seven-story tower to secondary office space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheridan does not view expanding into commercial real estate as a risky leap into the unknown.</p>
        <p>''We expect the diversification to be relatively smooth,'' he said. He plans to retrain some staff members and hire a few professionals with experience in commercial property.</p>
        <p>''In fact there are fewer potential problems with commercial properties than with residential properties,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''There are fewer tenants to be concerned with, the market is less vulnerable to sudden shifts, the facilities are simpler to operate and there are less complicated regulations to deal with.''</p>
