        <p>LEAD: Officials of the Guggenheim Museum, conceding that an earlier plan to add a cantilevered tower to the museum's celebrated Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building on Fifth Avenue had won little support while incurring the resentment of community groups and preservationists, presented a new, scaled-down design yesterday.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Guggenheim Museum, conceding that an earlier plan to add a cantilevered tower to the museum's celebrated Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building on Fifth Avenue had won little support while incurring the resentment of community groups and preservationists, presented a new, scaled-down design yesterday. The new Guggenheim tower, 10 stories high, would be one floor lower than the first plan. In its overall design, however, it differs more dramatically, and is now a discreet backdrop to the museum rather than a competing element.</p>
        <p>The new proposal, which, like the previous one, was designed by the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, represents a major retreat for the museum. For not only would the building be significantly smaller, it would also contain only additional exhibition space and museum offices. The earlier project would have had room for the museum's library, art-conservation department and art storage, all of which are now to be housed away from the main premises.</p>
        <p>''The first project was very satisfactory to us, but it did inspire expressions of dissatisfaction from certain parts of the community, and we are not insensitive to such expressions,'' the director of the museum, Thomas M. Messer, said at a news conference held in the museum to announce the new design. ''We felt we had no choice but to accept the reduced size of this new design.''</p>
        <p>The earlier project, announced in October 1985, was withdrawn last fall, shortly before New York City's Board of Standards and Appeals was to vote on it, when officials of the Guggenheim calculated that they did not have the votes to win approval. The board will also have to give its approval to the new project, since the shape and bulk of the proposed building require several variances from the city's zoning laws. The Landmarks Preservation Commission, which normally passes on additions to significant works of architecture in the city, has no jurisdiction here since the Guggenheim is neither an individual landmark - completed in 1959, it is too new to meet the requirement that landmarks be a minimum of 30 years old - nor is it within a historic district.</p>
        <p>The new design was described by Charles Gwathmey, one of the architects, as following ''a strategy of mediation with the Frank Lloyd Wright building rather than one of making a counterpoint.''</p>
        <p>''We abandoned the first scheme and went to a totally different one that we believe responded to the concerns of critics and people in the neighborhood,'' Mr. Gwathmey said.</p>
        <p>The tower, which would cost about $9 million, would be 133 feet high as compared with the 162-foot height of the earlier design. It would be sheathed in limestone rather than colored tile, and it would have a simple rectangular shape rather than the complex, projecting shape of the first project. It would be 35 feet wide as compared with the earlier design, which at the widest point of its cantilever over the Frank Lloyd Wright building would have had a width of nearly 50 feet. Facade Would Be Grooved</p>
        <p>The building would not be a stark box, however. Its facade would be articulated with a grid of deep grooves cut into the limestone in the form of a grid of roughly eight-foot squares, intended both to enliven the facade and to allude to a design that Frank Lloyd Wright himself made for this narrow site just behind the Guggenheim's main building. The Wright project, which never went beyond the stage of initial sketches, would have been a 25-foot-wide slab containing artists' studios, with a gridded glass and masonry facade that, like the Gwathmey Siegel design, was intended as a discreet backdrop for the more active, rounded forms of the museum itself.</p>
        <p>The new design would also contain four horizontal rows of narrow, deeply set windows, which together form a square. These would provide natural light for the offices within and give the tower facade an element to balance visually the mass of Frank Lloyd Wright's great rotunda. On the 89th Street side, the essential themes of the building would continue, but there would be more glass and the vertical grooves would fall away to make the grid a series of horizontal lines instead.</p>
        <p>Inside, the first seven floors would contain exhibition space to display a larger portion of the museum's permanent collection, 97 percent of which, according to museum officials, is now in storage. The new galleries would expand the amount of the collection on view only from 3 percent to 7 percent, Mr. Mr. Messer said, ''but that figure is highly misleading, since it is not a question of numbers of works but of masterpieces.''</p>
        <p>''Less than half of the things in our collection that we would consider masterpieces are now on view,'' he said, ''and there is no museum in the world that has that quality of work permanently invisible.'' He later estimated that roughly 200 works of ''masterpiece'' quality could go on permanent exhibition in the new wing.</p>
        <p>The exhibition floors in the new wing would connect at each level with the spiral ramp of the Frank Lloyd Wright building, which would continue to be used for temporary exhibitions. Some sections of some floors in the new wing would be cut out to yield double-height spaces and balconies, and there would be a large outdoor sculpture terrace off the fifth floor, on the roof of the ''little rotunda,'' the smaller section of the Wright building on the north end. Views of Park From the Terrace</p>
        <p>From the standpoint of the organization of space within the museum, the new design represents a degree of improvement over the earlier project - circulation will flow more easily through the galleries, and the sculpture terrace would be a special bonus, with spectacular views of Central Park as well as the chance to view the exterior of the main rotunda with an unusual intimacy.</p>
        <p>The inside was never the real question as regarded the earlier project, however; the controversy it engendered was over the effect it would have on a markedly eccentric, difficult building that is correctly viewed as one of the great works of architecture of the 20th century. The Guggenheim Museum has always been problematic as a display space, but it is triumphant as a work of architectural imagination. As a thing in itself it is as precious, surely, as any work of art it contains.</p>
        <p>There is a point of view that holds that such a masterwork should never be touched, and it is hard to disagree entirely with that: this building, for all its power, has a particular fragility, and cannot be tampered with easily. But that does not mean it cannot be added to at all, when an addition pays proper respect to the nature of the Wright original.</p>
        <p>The earlier design by Mr. Gwathmey and his partner, Robert Siegel, did not do that. It attempted something more ambitious, in its way - to speak back to Wright in a different language - and it was ultimately an act of hubris that deserved the abandonment it has now received. The new design is the product of a chastened sensibility, of the recognition that there are moments in architecture when strength consists of a willingness to stand back. Given the various factors at play here - the Guggenheim's institutional needs, the fact that Wright himself had designed a structure vaguely similar to the present proposal and the fundamentally deferential nature of this new design to Wright's original - there is a strong case to be made for the viability of this proposal.</p>
