        <p>LEAD: The national hysteria over drug abuse appears to have faded. Even the White House, having recently promised ''a sustained, relentless effort to rid America of this scourge,'' now talks of chopping drug enforcement funds. And in truth, the drug legislation hustled through Congress last year leaned more heavily toward spending than imagination.</p>
        <p>The national hysteria over drug abuse appears to have faded. Even the White House, having recently promised ''a sustained, relentless effort to rid America of this scourge,'' now talks of chopping drug enforcement funds. And in truth, the drug legislation hustled through Congress last year leaned more heavily toward spending than imagination. That's all the more reason to applaud a new spark of drug enforcement imagination in New York called work camps.</p>
        <p>In recent years, New York City officials have advanced their war on drug dealing on two important fronts. The police have succeeded in chasing dealers from traditional haunts in Washington Heights, the Lower East Side and Union Square, demonstrating the effectiveness of aggressive street patrols. And Albany finally has responded to legitimate demands for more city judges to meet the crack epidemic. Now the burden shifts to the courts to make drug justice less of a joke.</p>
        <p>But there is less reason for hope when it comes to prison space. Governor Cuomo has already expanded state prisons at enormous cost. Mayor Koch, pressured by the courts, has spent mightily to increase jail space on Rikers Island. Yet crowding continues to stay the hand of judges.</p>
        <p>The Law Enforcement Council, an alliance of police and prosecutors, therefore proposes to incarcerate first-time nonviolent drug offenders in ''work camps'' on the grounds of upstate prisons. A convict would be given a longer sentence but paroled after six months if he submits to the camp routine. It would include mornings of rigorous outdoor work under close supervision, followed by afternoons of education and counseling. Should he resist, he would be immediately returned to the main prison to serve out his term.</p>
        <p>Though clothed in images of hard labor and drill-sergeant supervision, the work camp proposal actually appears to be a sensible, even compassionate effort to reclaim young lives. Similar programs already operate with some success in other states. As important, it would make possible a rapid, affordable increase in prison capacity. Work camps for 900 prisoners per year would cost only $3 million to set up and $9.5 million a year to operate. Building 900 more cells would cost $50 million and $23 million a year to operate.</p>
        <p>The Governor's interest in the idea reflects a welcome shift. Only last summer Mr. Cuomo proposed life terms for crack dealers - an empty threat since life terms would only apply to a few of the worst offenders. The need isn't to lengthen sentences for a few but to increase the possibility of real punishment for many. Work camps would begin to do that, and include the chance for some rehabilitation in the bargain. That's too good a criminal justice deal to let pass.</p>
