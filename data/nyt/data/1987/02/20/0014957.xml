        <p>LEAD: Six-year-old Douglas Masterson, who has cerebral palsy, used to watch while his younger brother Joey played with toys that flashed, made interesting noises and moved across the floor of their home in Levittown, L.I.</p>
        <p>Six-year-old Douglas Masterson, who has cerebral palsy, used to watch while his younger brother Joey played with toys that flashed, made interesting noises and moved across the floor of their home in Levittown, L.I.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes he had a sad look on his face, like, 'I wish I could do that,' '' their mother, Joanne Masterson, recalled. She bought him toys, but he has only limited use of his hands and found most of them frustrating.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, however, sibling roles were reversed a little when Douglas checked a battery-operated police car out of a lending library at the United Cerebral Palsy Center here. The car, fitted with a special switch that responded to pressure from his hands, roamed back and forth at his command.</p>
        <p>''Joey was running after it,'' Mrs. Masterson said. ''They're interacting for the first time.''</p>
        <p>About 100 libraries in the United States lend toys adapted for disabled children. They are known as ''therapeutic libraries,'' said Diane Wilson, speaking for the U.S.A. Toy Library Association in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Some collections are tiny, housed in hospitals or schools. A teaching program, Lekotek, operates 33 libraries around the country, holding one-hour play sessions for disabled children and their families.</p>
        <p>A few are mobile. Every weekday morning two vans roll away from the David G. Osterer Cerebral Palsy Center in Rye Brook, N.Y., carrying most of the center's 1,400-piece library. Driven by the center's two librarians, they traverse five New York counties, all New York City boroughs and parts of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The vans have all but replaced the original library, housed in the center since 1982, because it is difficult for many parents to reach. ''It's best for us to go to them,'' said the program director, Martin C. Stone. Fitting the Toy to the Child</p>
        <p>Staff members help match toys to children's abilities. Motorized toys have jacks for plugging in switches of various types: velvet-covered for a blind child, voice-activated for one who needs to work on speaking.</p>
        <p>A few toys, such as a jack-in-the-box, have added motors that replace complicated motions like cranking and pulling. The Rye Brook library has xylophones with switches on every bar that respond to pressure so that a hammer - and the hammering motion some disabled people find difficult - is not necessary.</p>
        <p>Both the Roosevelt and Rye Brook libraries stock large switches for controlling personal computers, and both offer tape recorders and radios that appeal to disabled grown-ups. Among their most popular items for children are a switch-controlled ''Spin Art,'' in which a parent or teacher pours in paint and the child stops the machine when he feels the spattery design is complete, and ''Busy Boxes,'' which have buzzers and radios that sound at the press of a plate-shaped switch.</p>
        <p>But therapeutic libraries are expensive to establish and maintain, which prevents many groups from starting them, Mr. Stone said. Commercially available toys cost $25 to $40, and adapting them can add $70 to $150 more. Broken toys need to be replaced, and fixing motor parts runs up large bills.</p>
        <p>The Rye Brook library spends about $90,000 each year, relying on state and private grants. Because its financial future is uncertain, it may begin charging a fee to parents who can afford to pay, Mr. Stone said.</p>
        <p>Parents and teachers praise adapted toys for helping disabled children learn and develop, and enabling them to have control over a part of their lives.</p>
        <p>''The world usually just happens in front of them,'' said Debbie Blakeley, one of the Rye Brook librarians. ''These toys let them become part of the world.''</p>
