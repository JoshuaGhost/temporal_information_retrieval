        <p>LEAD: Leonard Fein remembers vividly the unplanned circumstances that led him to create an organization he named Mazon, the Hebrew word for food, which is helping feed the hungry in the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>Leonard Fein remembers vividly the unplanned circumstances that led him to create an organization he named Mazon, the Hebrew word for food, which is helping feed the hungry in the United States and abroad.</p>
        <p>He had flown to Los Angeles on business and met Rabbi Harold Schulweis for lunch when a sleek black BMW drove into the parking lot of the Temple Valley Beth Shalom. The rabbi identified the young, prosperous-looking driver as ''our caterer and the caterer for half a dozen other synagogues.''</p>
        <p>The kosher catering business must be profitable, Mr. Fein remembered saying. Later, with some research, he says he discovered to his shock that caterers handling weddings, bar mitzvahs and other affairs around the country grossed about $500 million annually.</p>
        <p>''A light bulb flashed over my head and I started figuring a small percent of that sum could mean a lot of food for hungry people,'' Mr. Fein said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>Within weeks he had recruited a group of volunteers to help create Mazon. He also developed its formula for asking Jewish families celebrating happy events to share their good fortune by contributing 3 percent of the costs to Mazon.</p>
        <p>''There was no significance to the figure, except to make it small enough to be reasonable and large enough to be meaningful,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The first announcement of the establishment of Mazon was made in the magazine Moment, which Mr. Fein publishes in Boston, where he lives. He describes the magazine as a ''monthly invitation to Jewish life in all its parts.''</p>
        <p>Mazon's modest office opened 15 months ago at 2288 Westwood Boulevard in Los Angeles, a city selected because it was the home of the organization's executive director, Irving Cramer. The operation is a lean one, run by Mr. Cramer and a secretary.</p>
        <p>In its first month, Mazon raised only $2,300. But a year later, Mr. Cramer said, Mazon was raising $80,000 a month, and he said the increased rate of contributions suggested it could raise $4 million to $5 million a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer said the response came from all parts of the country and from Reform, Orthodox and Conservative congregations. 'I'll Make Time'</p>
        <p>Rabbi Jack Moline of Congregation B'Nai Israel in Danbury, Conn., for example, wrote to Mr. Fein that although he was continually urged to deliver sermons about good causes, he found it impossible not to heed Mazon's compelling appeal.</p>
        <p>''I'll make time and I'll make room,'' he promised. ''I thank you for being my rabbi.''</p>
        <p>Other Jewish fund-raising organizations welcomed the newcomer. When the annual black-tie gala of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies was held earlier this month in Phoenix, guests were told that party planners had dispensed with the customary hors d'oeuvres and would send the savings to Mazon. First Grants Totaled $20,000</p>
        <p>The organization gave its first grants last June, contributing a total of $20,000 to seven organizations. One grant went to a program to feed the elderly on Manhattan's Lower East Side. A second group of 12 grants totaled $87,000. Funds are disbursed on a nonsectarian basis.</p>
        <p>One $6,000 grant was made to the Food for Free Committee in Cambridge, Mass., to help the organization distribute surplus food collected from supermarkets. Before the Mazon funds arrived, the Food for Free Committee had advised the charities running food programs that it would have to stop food deliveries because it lacked money to pay for truck drivers.</p>
        <p>He said Mazon would hold another major fund-raising campaign in coming weeks, hoping the observance of the Passover, which begins April, 13 would prompt Jewish families to respond.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, Jews begin the Passover seder with the words, ''Let all who are hungry enter and eat,'' Mr. Fein said, adding, ''This year, we are asking that in every home and hall where Jews gather to recall their liberation from bondage in Egypt, they will send a donation to Mazon. If each family can make it possible for just one who is hungry to enter and eat, we will have accomplished a great deal.''</p>
