        <p>LEAD: There is no single answer to the problem posed by surplus public school buildings  [ ''Let's Save Our 'Surplus' Schools,'' Opinion Page, Dec. 7, and Letters to the Long Island Editor, Dec. 28 and Jan. 18 ] .</p>
        <p>There is no single answer to the problem posed by surplus public school buildings  [ ''Let's Save Our 'Surplus' Schools,'' Opinion Page, Dec. 7, and Letters to the Long Island Editor, Dec. 28 and Jan. 18 ] .</p>
        <p>The solution offered by some districts has the advantage of simplicity and political attractiveness: consolidate the existing pupil population into fewer buildings, close and sell the rest (returning the property to the tax rolls) and use the sale proceeds to modernize those schools remaining active.</p>
        <p>If we look no further than the present, there is nothing wrong with that solution. But what of the future?</p>
        <p>Can a school board guarantee that there will be no rise in the number of youngsters to be educated in their district, ever again? Official predictions, based upon trends as presently perceived, can and do change as an area's demographics, laws and life styles change. If we now retain just enough space to handle current enrollment, selling the remainder as disposable surplus, even a small upswing in our school-age population could send us scurrying for whatever space we can find, at whatever cost. And who will say this cannot happen? The key to the answer for us on Long Island, especially in Nassau County, is land.</p>
        <p>Over all, there is very little open, available, suitably located land left here, even today - and there will be less tomorrow. Construction costs continue upward. Property taxes, the major source of revenue for public education, are high. If we now dispose of presently surplus schools, the needs of a possibly larger pupil population in the future could only be met by purchases or condemnations plus construction and equipping of new buildings, at a cost that would saddle future citizens with long-term tax increases for principal and interest payments on substantial new debt.</p>
        <p>Are there alternatives to selling off not presently needed school lands and buildings?</p>
        <p>Some districts have shown the way by leasing such space to other governmental agencies, especially those oriented toward senior citizens and social services. In-use schools can be maintained and improved without selling the others, which can serve the schools rent-free while the active buildings are being modernized. And if new demands arise for more permanent space, the once-excessed schools can be reactivated at a fraction of the expense of buying land, new buildings and new equipment.</p>
        <p>Each district with surplus schools must make its own decision, based upon its own estimates of future school-age population and future costs for land, construction and equipment - keeping in mind that while the sale of surplus school properties may be a popular solution as of now, it may be a very costly one in the longer run.
