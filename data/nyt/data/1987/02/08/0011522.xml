        <p>LEAD: The unemphatic art of Paul Klee has entered the universal language not only of fine art but of advertising, graphic design, high-quality cartooning and communications in general. Short of hiding under the sofa, it would be difficult to pass a day in a big city anywhere in the Western world and not be reminded of Paul Klee over and over again.</p>
        <p>The unemphatic art of Paul Klee has entered the universal language not only of fine art but of advertising, graphic design, high-quality cartooning and communications in general. Short of hiding under the sofa, it would be difficult to pass a day in a big city anywhere in the Western world and not be reminded of Paul Klee over and over again. His way with faces, with the human body (complete or fragmented) and with animals of every kind is all-pervading. So are the big broad arrows, the use of outsize letters, initials or complete words, the all-purpose ideograms and the shorthand architectures.</p>
        <p>The uses to which Klee - whose retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art opens to the public tomorrow - put these devices were peculiar to himself. As a young man he could draw with ink on paper in an almost continuous cobweb-like line that could result in a small masterpiece like the ''Suicide on the Bridge'' of 1913. After a visit to Tunisia in 1914 he learned to paint watercolors in which pure and vibrant color worked as an equal partner with line. Perhaps best known for fantasy that never degenerates into whimsy, he could package painful and unwelcome truths about the plight of Europe in ways that initially seemed mild enough but turned out to have a Kafkaesque substructure.</p>
        <p>Though himself inimitable, in all the ways that matter, he did his level best, both as teacher and as writer, to explain how it was done. And when the terrible tests came, and it became clear that Europe would be taken apart, piece by piece, and trashed, Klee was equal to the occasion. He could not cast out fear, but he taught us to look fear in the face as upright human beings. In all these respects he was guide and master, companion and exemplar. Above all, he had a confidential approach, and we feel that he is talking to us, and to us only, about the things that matter most.</p>
        <p>Klee had a way of leaping ahead of our understanding and trusting to us to catch up with him. Posterity has proved that he had the right idea. His harbors are our harbors, his birds our birds, his feasts our feasts. He functioned as poet and critic, epigrammatist and diagnostician, and a handwritten list of those who have borrowed from Paul Klee and got away with it would stretch from this office to Weehawken.</p>
        <p>Yet he does not, even today, rank as high as he should in popular estimation. People do not talk about the Klee show at the Modern in the way that they talk about van Gogh at the Met or Matisse at the National Gallery. This is not because they have studied the work closely and found it wanting, but because they think that they know all about it already. That Klee borrowed-from is Klee diluted and diminished has not occurred to them. Besides, his output was enormous. A total tally of more than 4,000 paintings and around 5,000 drawings is more than even the specialist can keep up with. ''There's just too damn much of him,'' people say. ''And, besides, aren't they all much alike? Who needs another room of Klees?'' This point of view - monitored at the recent opening of the new Lila Acheson Wallace Wing at the Met - is heard all too often. ''Seen one, seen them all'' would sum it up. This was not the case in Klee's lifetime. As early as 1930, he was the first living European painter to be given a one-person show at the Museum of Modern Art. Marcel Duchamp was not the man to come up with an empty compliment, and he laid it on the line that ''Klee's extreme fecundity never shows signs of repetition.'' In 1941, Alfred H. Barr Jr. wrote in the catalogue to the Modern's second Klee show that ''Not even Picasso approaches him in sheer inventiveness. In quality of imagination, also, he can hold his own with Picasso; but Picasso of course is incomparably more powerful. Picasso's pictures often roar or stomp or pound; Klee's whisper a soliloquy.''</p>
        <p>Another key witness to the 1940's is the painter and printmaker S. W. Hayter, who remembers Klee as ''a man who covered an enormous amount of territory from the point of ideas'' and was ''without a doubt'' an influence upon Pollock, Newman, Rothko, Motherwell and others. ''Whether they knew it or not,'' Clement Greenberg once said, ''everyone was learning from Paul Klee.''</p>
        <p>But today, 40 and some years later, we do not look at Klee for ideas as to the directions that painting can most profitably take. We look at him for content - for the incomparably deft, ironical but deeply felt way in which he tacked this way and that among the problems that presented themselves to a gifted and exceptionally intelligent man throughout the first 40 years of a terrible century. This seen, Klee's career looks more and more like one long rescue operation, through which an irreplaceable something was saved, over and over again, from a civilization in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Klee's reputation in this country has suffered from what might be called the ''little work, little man'' syndrome. Since World War II, in particular, big pictures have had a prestige all their own. They are unavoidable, in a straightforward physical sense, and unavoidably they get talked about. Pictures that we can almost put into our pockets have no such cachet. Besides, Klee's paintings have to be read, as well as looked at. Each one of them operates as a treasure hunt, and the treasure may take some finding.</p>
        <p>Their smallness was due in part to his delight in idiosyncratic handmade blendings of oil and tempera, watercolor and gesso. (Visitors to his studio were fascinated by their almost alchemical complication.) Not until 1938, when he was within two years of his death at 61 in May 1940, did he paint anything that would now be regarded as a large painting, and it is a mark of his agility and versatility that at that same time, back in his native Switzerland after many years in Germany, he was producing drawings in very large numbers - in all, 1,583, according to his own minutely kept catalogue, between 1938 and 1940. Neither illness nor the steady deterioration of Europe could stanch that flow.</p>
        <p>Thinking of that ghastly decade, I remember what Klee once said when someone put forward the view - still common at the time - that Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' should really end when Don Giovanni is dragged down to hell. What was the point of that chirpy little finale? Klee did not agree. ''Not at all,'' he said. ''It's just like any other catastrophe. Everyone hides under the table, and then after a while they put their heads out of the window to see who else is left alive.'' To the day of his death, Klee was putting his head out of the window to see who else was still alive, and we are the richer for his having done it.</p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, the Modern Museum show is not yet installed. But I judge from the book that doubles as a catalogue that it contains close to 400 works of art. The catalogue - edited by Carolyn Lanchner, curator at the Modern and director of this particular show - also contains lengthy essays on four different aspects of Klee's career. These essays are rich in auxiliary material, and some of it is of a disconcerting sort.</p>
        <p>Readers who look upon Switzerland in World War II as a sanctuary unpolluted by Nazi ideas may be surprised, for instance, to read of the Swiss police sergeant who reported on Paul Klee to his superiors in the fall of 1939. (Born in Switzerland in 1879, but long resident in Germany, Klee had applied for the restitution of his citizenship.) After an interview with him, the sergeant concluded that Klee was on the verge of insanity. Furthermore, he said, there were well-known Swiss painters who saw him as a threat to themselves. ''If his tendencies were to gain a foothold in this country it would be an insult to true art, a deterioration of good taste and of the healthy ideas of the population.'' As his last word, the sergeant suggested that Klee's work was bring promoted by Jewish dealers for reasons of personal gain only. His report was overruled, but it does not make pleasant reading.</p>
        <p>Paul Klee did not have either a dramatic or an adventurous life, in everyday terms, but his imaginative life was one of the subtlest that we can hope to penetrate. He had as keen a sense as anyone then living of the prospects for Europe, but he expressed it obliquely, as often as not leaving it to us to find the key that fitted that particular lock. One of everyone's favorite Klees is, for instance, the ''Revolution of the Viaduct'' of 1937. (It exists in several forms, by the way.) What we see is a viaduct whose arches have broken ranks in such a way that each one of them walks away by itself on flat feet provided by Klee for the purpose. It can be read in several ways - as a symbol of a whole world on the march, as an emblem of individuality and independence, or as an equivocal reference to the concept of revolution. O. K. Werckmeister, in his catalogue essay, suggests that the viaduct in question incorporates elements from Albert Speer's model for the Olympic Stadium in Nuremberg in 1937 and is, in fact, a direct rebuttal of the uniform, obedient, brainwashed society for which that stadium stood. So we can think whatever we please, as Klee would certainly have wished us to do, But then, uniformity of any kind was anathema to Klee, whereas differentiation was life itself. In his native Switzerland there were times of the year when even the uniformity of trees below the snow-line was offensive to him. (''Too much like spinach,'' he said.) An accomplished violinist, he preferred the give-and-take of chamber music, so expressive of individual human character, to the relatively regimented efforts of the municipal orchestra in which he played as a young man. He responded to every possible nuance of the human face, and long before anyone talked about body language he was a past master of it. As for the stuffed shirt, the man dressed in brief authority and the blustering brute, he had their measure, and we can never take them quite seriously when we have seen what he made of them.</p>
        <p>He was, in fact, as civilized a man as the history of art has to show. (It may or may not say something for his perfectly equilibrated nature that he painted and drew with his left hand and wrote with his right.) He never talked big about either his work or himself, never quarreled, and is never known to have sought ''inspiration'' in love affairs.</p>
        <p>He had a brilliant sense of theater, and many of his paintings and drawings relate to that. But he was also completely at home with placid, uneventful nature, provided that it was not too homogeneous. It was nature, as it is found in Tunisia, that prompted one of the few wholly ecstatic entries in his diary. ''Color possesses me here,'' he wrote in April 1914. ''I don't have to go hunting for it. I am color's captive, for ever. Color and I are one. I am a painter.''</p>
        <p>That ecstatic moment, along with many others, will be set before us at the Museum of Modern Art. Nor should readers forget, in this context, the roomful of Klees from the Berggruen collection in the new Lila Acheson Wallace wing at the Met. But in case Paul Klee himself should seem to be hiding behind his art, too shy to take a bow, here is a last glimpse of him in life.</p>
        <p>When he went to work at the Bauhaus in Weimar in 1921, someone who lived beneath him used sometimes to hear a strange, phantomatic pit-a-pat from Klee's studio above. Meeting Klee in the corridor, he asked if he too had noticed it. ''So you heard it?'' said Klee. ''I'm terribly sorry. I was painting away, and it was going very well, suddenly I couldn't help dancing. I never dance ordinarily, but this time I just had to.'' Who could not love such a man? If anyone deserved to be a friendly neighborhood Fred Astaire, it was Paul Klee.</p>
