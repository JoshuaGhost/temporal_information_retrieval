        <p>LEAD: Small is beautiful. Aside from such mastodons of culture as the Louvre and the Grand Palais, Paris blossoms with small museums rich with art and offering fascinating curiosities in smaller doses.</p>
        <p>Small is beautiful. Aside from such mastodons of culture as the Louvre and the Grand Palais, Paris blossoms with small museums rich with art and offering fascinating curiosities in smaller doses.</p>
        <p>This nation of individualists has created more than 1,800 museums, 96 of them in Paris. Many are small, usually uncrowded and soothing to visitors who hate risking collision when stepping back to admire a piece. And in as little as a half hour one can tantalize the mind and soul with learning - when women got the vote in France, what Balzac's home looked like, how wine and perfume are made.</p>
        <p>My tour of these wee storehouses of culture began with the Museum of Public Hospitals, installed in a handsome 1630 mansion on the Left Bank a few steps from the policemen guarding the street where President Francois Mitterrand lives.</p>
        <p>Paintings, engravings, illuminated manuscripts and porcelain objects relate how the sick poor were crammed several to a bed in hospitals of the Middle Ages and then just fed and blessed. Only in the 18th century did medical treatment appear. The mentally ill were imprisoned in these primitive hospitals, and until special homes were built in the 17th century, hundreds of lost or abandoned children lived and died on the streets. Seventeenth- and 18th-century medical tools and a reproduction of an 18th-century hospital room with three curtained private beds show how much progress had been made.</p>
        <p>In the area around Notre Dame cathedral, one can tour several small museums. In front of the cathedral, an archeological crypt, the largest in Europe, takes a visitor even further back in history. Roman thermal baths and a shop of the third- to fourth-century, the foundations of a sixth-century church and medieval houses were uncovered by a dig for an underground parking lot between 1965 and 1970.</p>
        <p>The Notre Dame Museum, next to the cathedral, exhibits coins and jewels pried out of the rubble at that parking site. Paintings and documents show Notre Dame's construction and stabs at remodeling. Inside the cathedral, elaborate crosses and chalices used by popes and archbishops and gifts offered by kings glitter in the Treasure Room Museum.</p>
        <p>Another small museum, the Wine Museum on the west side of Paris, is worth a happy hour. It was organized by a wine dealers' association in the cellars of what had been a 15th-century abbey in a peaceful vineyard, now a mass of apartments and bustling streets. Life-size wax figures, earthenware amphoras, ancient bottles and glasses, corkscrews, harvest tools and winemaking equipment tell how wine has been made and drunk down the centuries.</p>
        <p>At the end of the tour, of course, is a bar for sampling the results of the art, 15 wines from about $1 to $1.70 a glass. A shop sells wine at $6 a bottle and up, as well as such souvenirs (at about $7 up) as dish towels, posters, bottle openers and plates decorated with drawings of vineyards.</p>
        <p>The equally tantalizing Tobacco Museum does not promote smoking, although it is operated by the French tobacco industry. It tells the history of tobacco's discovery in America, complete with two American cigar-toting wooden Indians, a 20-minute film and a fine pipe collection. Also industry-backed are the Lorgnette Museum with its 3,000 examples from the 15th century on, and the Perfume Museum's collection of perfume-making equipment and dressing-table objects, the better to induce you to buy perfume on the spot.</p>
        <p>The smallest of them all, perhaps, is the Museum of Fakes, on the right bank not far from Place Victor Hugo. Its bottles of Cointreau and Triple Sec, Dior wallets, Louis Vuitton handbags and Nina Ricci and Givenchy perfumes are not the real French thing but copies made in Morocco and elsewhere. Faking dates back to the wine amphora plugs on display that were made by the Gauls in third-century France to imitate the prestigious plugs of the Romans.</p>
        <p>Around the corner is the Ennery villa. In 1899, the Ennery family left to the state their mansion and their collection of Chinese and Japanese art. The main floor of the house is crammed with 7,269 objects, from carved ivory miniatures to life-size bronze tigers, from masks to mirrors, and enough dragons to populate Beijing.</p>
        <p>This astounding sight is worth a visit, if only for the gasp. But the larger Cernuschi museum offers less quantity and more quality in Chinese art, especially breathtaking figurines dating to the fourth century B.C. The Ennery villa also houses the Armenian Museum, which preserves Armenian ceramics, rugs, jewels, paintings and documents.</p>
        <p>After the Ennery, the Museum of Musical Instruments provides a smile of joy. For one thing, the visitor first enters France's Conservatory of Music to find students hurrying by with their books and budding sopranos practicing scales in the hallways. True works of art are the museum's 17th-century French, Italian and Spanish guitars decorated with stripes, checks and sculptured faces. Harpsichords of the 16th and 17th centuries are painted with flowers and birds, violin cases gleam with silver and a tiny 18th-century ivory violin turns into a fan. It all conjures up visions of gentlemen in ruffled white shirts and ladies in powdered wigs.</p>
        <p>Another museum for music lovers fills two rooms of the Paris Opera. Music scores, costumes, set models, sculptures of composers, the ballet slippers of Nijinski and Pavlova and mementos of their director, Diaghilev, recall great nights at the opera.</p>
        <p>There are clusters of tiny museums in several Paris neighborhoods. A pleasant Sunday walk in Montmartre can be made from the Jewish Art Museum to the Montmartre Museum in an old hilltop house, and then to the new Le Halle St. Pierre museum of naive art installed in an old food market pavilion.</p>
        <p>Across from the Pompidou Center nestles the Museum of Mechanical Musical Instruments. A delight for children as well as their elders is watching the guide operate delicate 19th-century player pianos, violins and a Louisiana banjo. Even paintings and statuettes move to music. Anyone fascinated by machines could spend hours in the National Technical Museum, not far from the Pompidou Center. Auto fans can head for a 1931 Citroen cut in half to show the engine, enormous 19th-century bicycles, Louis Bleriot's airplane that made the first flight over the English Channel in 1909 and other machines garaged, alas, in a 12th-century church. Adjoining rooms in an old abbey display more than 8,000 instruments and machines from the 16th to 20th centuries.</p>
        <p>Within walking distance is the remarkable Hunt and Nature Museum in a magnificent 18th-century mansion overlooking a formal garden. For hunters there are stuffed animals and silver-encrusted rifles. For nonhunting nature lovers are old ceramic animals, King Louis XV's lace handkerchief of a hunting scene and furniture carved with animals.</p>
        <p>An easy walk away, inside another 18th-century palace, is the History of France museum. Intriguing documents fill the display cases: a revolutionary order sending Marie Antoinette to the guillotine, a 1914 appeal for taxis to save the French army at the Marne, a 1944 law giving women the right to vote.</p>
        <p>Up the street the Kwok On Museum shows costumes, masks and puppets from Asian theaters. And the nearby home of Victor Hugo displays his furniture, drawings and mementos.</p>
        <p>In fact, it's a French custom to honor the nation's creators with museums in their homes - Balzac, President Georges Clemenceau, Pasteur, the sculptors Emile Bourdelle, Ossip Zadkine (he had a curious sculpture garden) and Rodin, Edith Piaf and the painters Gustave Moreau, Ernest Hebert and Eugene Delacroix. Lenin's modest two-room flat also can be opened upon request.</p>
        <p>Little museums thus can give an insight into how Parisians lived in the past. Near the Place Pigalle a driveway lined with a garden trellis and memories of horse-drawn carriages leads to the nearly hidden home of Ary Scheffer, the painter. It was a gathering place for the 19th-century literary and artistic world. Two rooms are full of memories of George Sand - her jewelry, cigar box, plaster casts of her arm reaching out to another cast of her friend Chopin.</p>
        <p>The Cognacq-Jay museum, resplendent with the furniture and art of a department store magnate, reflects the time in the 19th century when Paris high life centered around les grands boulevards near the Opera.</p>
        <p>The Nissim-de-Camondo displays family heirlooms of the Count de Camondo, who bequeathed his mansion to France in memory of his son, Nissim, who was killed in World War I; later it was dedicated to Nissim's daughter and her husband, who perished in the Auschwitz death camp during World War II. Aubusson and Savonnerie tapestries, 18th-century furniture, paintings and Sevres dishes, all following the theme of birds and animals, appear as if they awaited the return of the family. Even the silverware gleams on a sideboard in the dining room.  A GUIDE TO SMALL MUSEUMS  Right Bank East  &gt;Cognacq-Jay Museum&gt;, 25 Boulevard des Capucines; telephone 42.61.94.54.
