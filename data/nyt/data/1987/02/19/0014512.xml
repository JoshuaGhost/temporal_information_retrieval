        <p>A judge reduced bond from $100,000 to $20,000 today for two men held for two weeks on charges of child neglect after being found in a city playground with six children.</p>
        <p>The men, Douglas Edward Ammerman, 27 years old, and James Michael Holwell, 23, both of Washington, were returned to the County Jail after Leon County Judge George Reynolds rejected a public defender's request that the men be released on their own recognizance.</p>
        <p>Two women, Pat Livingston and Paula Arico, who like the men belong to a secretive communal group once known as the Finders, testified they were mothers of three of the six children, and that they had given the men permission to take the children on a trip through Kentucky to visit a minister.</p>
