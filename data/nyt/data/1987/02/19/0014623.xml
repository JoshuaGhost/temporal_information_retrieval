        <p>LEAD: Lisa S. Taylor, who as director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum for nearly two decades increased the public's awareness of historical and contemporary design, said yesterday that she planned to resign because of ill health.</p>
        <p>Lisa S. Taylor, who as director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum for nearly two decades increased the public's awareness of historical and contemporary design, said yesterday that she planned to resign because of ill health.</p>
        <p>''I love the museum, but the work has become physically too demanding and I have to concentrate my energies on getting well,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Taylor, who is 54 years old, said the Smithsonian Institution, of which the Cooper-Hewitt is a part, was in the process of establishing a search committee to find someone to succeed her as director.</p>
        <p>''There should be a lot of applicants,'' she said. ''It has got to be one of the most coveted jobs in the country. We have a lot of fun there.''</p>
        <p>The Cooper-Hewitt, which is also known as the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design, has a far-ranging collection that covers 3,000 years of artistic production. Its exhibitions, under Mrs. Taylor, have placed the emphasis on how design relates to the quality of life. Named Director in 1969</p>
        <p>Mrs. Taylor's association with the museum began in 1969, when she was named as its director by S. Dillon Ripley, then secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, after she had helped devise a highly successful Smithsonian education program.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian had taken over the Cooper-Hewitt two years earlier from the Cooper Union at the instigation of a citizen's rescue committee, headed by the late Henry du Pont.</p>
        <p>The Smithsonian could easily have housed the Cooper-Hewitt in Washington, but feeling ran strong among its supporters that it should stay in New York, because New York was a design center.</p>
        <p>In 1972, the Carnegie Corporaton donated the Carnegie mansion, built in 1901 at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue by Andrew Carnegie.</p>
        <p>Within four years, Mrs. Taylor and her staff succeeded in obtaining more than $6 million from foundations, corporations and private individuals to transform the mansion into the museum's new home.</p>
        <p>Under Mrs. Taylor's leadership, the museum has won more than 50 awards from professional societies for its exhibitions, publications and programs.</p>
