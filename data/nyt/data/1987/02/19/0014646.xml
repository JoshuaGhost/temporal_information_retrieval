        <p>LEAD: Allan Mitchell (Al) Robbins, a video artist who showed his work at the Whitney Museum and Anthology Film Archives here as well as at museums abroad, died of a heart attack Feb. 8 in San Francisco. He was 49 years old and lived in New York City.</p>
        <p>Allan Mitchell (Al) Robbins, a video artist who showed his work at the Whitney Museum and Anthology Film Archives here as well as at museums abroad, died of a heart attack Feb. 8 in San Francisco. He was 49 years old and lived in New York City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robbins was known for his innovative closed-circuit video installations in which he explored the physical nature of the medium. In ''Anticata/ Strophe,'' shown at the Whitney in 1980, for instance, he used 12 video monitors that carried images of waves breaking and birds in flight, interacting with sound and images recorded by cameras in the gallery, to produce a ''sculptural'' electronic environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robbins, born in Chicago in 1938, studied design and architecture with Buckminster Fuller at Southern Illinois University. In the 1960's, he began working with film, producing ''Gut Poem'' in 1969. The project led to his interest in video and his work with installations. A collection of his writings, ''Don't Let These Words Set,'' was published in 1980.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robbins is survived by his mother, Florence Glass, of Los Angeles. A memorial service will be held at the Whitney Museum on March 4, from 5:30 to 7 P.M.</p>
