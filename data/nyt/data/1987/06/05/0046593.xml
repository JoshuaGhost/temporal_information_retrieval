        <p>LEAD: The state's environmental commissioner today ordered 15,000 barrels of radium-contaminated soil that have been stored in Montclair and Kearny moved to state-owned land in Jackson Township.</p>
        <p>The state's environmental commissioner today ordered 15,000 barrels of radium-contaminated soil that have been stored in Montclair and Kearny moved to state-owned land in Jackson Township.</p>
        <p>The Commissioner, Richard T. Dewling, issued an executive order for the transfer, which could begin in a week, to meet a court-ordered June 15 deadline to begin the removal.</p>
        <p>Radium and radon, a colorless, odorless gas produced when it decays, are believed to cause cancer.</p>
        <p>The interim storage site is in the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area, less than 500 yards from a former Air Force missile site that is contaminated with plutonium as the result of a missile accident there in the 1960's. It also is about a mile from the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. Safety, Not Health, Is Concern</p>
        <p>The 5,000 drums in Montclair will be moved first, Mr. Dewling said. He said he hoped to have dozens of Montclair residents who were evacuated more than a year ago back in their homes by Christmas.</p>
        <p>''It is not a public health problem, but a public safety problem,'' he said. ''There is concern that the barrels could block traffic and prevent emergency vehicles from getting to a fire in one of the houses that are not occupied.''</p>
        <p>The announcement was welcomed by legislators who represent Montclair and Kearny, but condemned by Republican lawmakers from Ocean County, some of whom called for Mr. Dewling's resignation.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Frank J. Gargiulo, Republican of North Bergen, whose district includes Kearny, said, ''This is the first bit of good news we've had.''</p>
        <p>Assemblyman John V. Kelly, Republican of Nutley, said: ''Seeing is believing. I'll celebrate when I see the barrels gone from Montclair.'' Temporary Storage Planned</p>
        <p>Two Ocean County Assemblymen, John T. Hendrickson and Robert W. Singer, said Mr. Dewling should resign, and Assemblyman Jeffrey W. Moran of Ocean County said he was prepared to challenge the transfer in court. ''This material is not from Ocean County and it's not going to end up there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dewling said he anticipated a challenge, but said he believed he was on firm footing in issuing the order for the temporary transfer. ''It's a difficult decision to make but I have to think about the whole state and not an individual backyard,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The plan is to use about 2.5 acres of the 12,250-acre state wildlife preserve to store the barrels for up to six months until a municipality is found to accept the barrels temporarily. The state is still trying to find a means of permanent disposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dewling said his department had talked to about 10 towns and two were still showing some interest in being the temporary storage site. ''I won't mention their names because whenever I mention a town the officials get spooked,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said, however, that one of the towns the state had talks with was Kearny. The state would have paid the town $6.8 million, to continue to keep the 10,000 barrels already there and temporarily store the 5,000 from Montclair. He said town officials rejected the plan in the last few days.</p>
