        <p>LEAD: John B. Fraser, the president of Morgan Grenfell Inc., the New York-based subsidiary of the British merchant bank, has left to become a managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department of the Citicorp Investment Bank.</p>
        <p>John B. Fraser, the president of Morgan Grenfell Inc., the New York-based subsidiary of the British merchant bank, has left to become a managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department of the Citicorp Investment Bank.</p>
        <p>At Morgan Grenfell, Keith R. Harris, 34, was named to succeed Mr. Fraser, 52.</p>
        <p>Morgan Grenfell's American unit was a small operation largely confined to representing the parent's interests until it became a subsidiary in 1981 and Mr. Fraser was hired as president to build up its investment banking business.</p>
        <p>At Citicorp, he will be responsible for international merger and acquisition activities and for expanding business with large multinational companies, Citicorp said. He will be one of five managing directors based in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris, his successor at Morgan Grenfell, is a Briton who has been in the New York office for nearly two years. Morgan Grenfell also named as managing directors Gregory T. K. Hsu, 40; Colin L. MacVeagh, 39, and Neil A. O'Hara, 34.</p>
        <p>Morgan Grenfell's parent in London has been entangled in the financial scandal surrounding one of its clients, Guinness P.L.C., and as a result has a new chief executive, John Craven. Yesterday, Mr. Fraser praised Mr. Craven, with whom he had worked at Credit Suisse White Weld, calling him a ''superb addition to management.''</p>
        <p>His new Citicorp position, Mr. Fraser said, ''is an extremely interesting job and one with an institution I think is going to be one of the dominant players in investment banking in the coming years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser was a partner at White Weld &amp; Company and then was with Credit Suisse White Weld, which became Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr. Fraser was at First Boston briefly before joining Morgan Grenfell. He is a graduate of Yale University and the Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Harris, recent days have been particularly busy. He was called out of a meeting the other day because his wife, Judy, was about to have their first baby. Mr. Harris was home yesterday, helping care for their newborn, Francesca. ''This is more interesting, and more tiring, than work,'' he said. ''It's been a remarkable few months, and this caps the whole lot of it.''  BUSINESS PEOPLE</p>
