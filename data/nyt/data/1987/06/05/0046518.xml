        <p>LEAD: ''THE next song, 'Scratch,' requires four alligator clips, a bolt, a comb and a guitar slide to make it sound just right,'' Roger Miller said Wednesday night at CBGB. He calmly placed those objects on the strings of a Yamaha electric grand piano and -using reverberation and distortion devices, a synthesizer and a tape-loop echo-repeat system - played another plinking, clanking, crunching, howling song.</p>

        <p>LEAD: ''THE next song, 'Scratch,' requires four alligator clips, a bolt, a comb and a guitar slide to make it sound just right,'' Roger Miller said Wednesday night at CBGB.

        <p>''THE next song, 'Scratch,' requires four alligator clips, a bolt, a comb and a guitar slide to make it sound just right,'' Roger Miller said Wednesday night at CBGB. He calmly placed those objects on the strings of a Yamaha electric grand piano and -using reverberation and distortion devices, a synthesizer and a tape-loop echo-repeat system - played another plinking, clanking, crunching, howling song.</p>
        <p>In solo performances he calls ''maximum electric piano,'' Mr. Miller deploys keyboards to create the kind of driving, half-cacophonous rock he used to play with the band Mission of Burma. He layers on chords, percussive riffs - part Stravinsky, part minimalism - and noises, sometimes singing erudite lyrics (like ''No Man Is Hurting Me,'' based on the Odyssey) or playing a fuzz-toned synthesizer solo amid the rhythmic clatter. His songs tend to move from one sonic assemblage to another in carefully paced waves of harmony and noise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's model is clearly Jimi Hendrix, to whom he paid tribute with a version of Hendrix's ''Manic Depression.'' He wants to do for the electric piano what Hendrix did for guitar, creating a new vocabulary of electronic noises. Some of those noises are now familiar - with enough distortion, an electric piano sounds a lot like an electric guitar -but Mr. Miller's songs have jolts in all the right places.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller also has a sense of humor. Although he is not related to the Roger Miller who wrote ''Big River,'' he encored with a version of the other Mr. Miller's ''King of the Road,'' a song about trailers, that sounded like vans in collision.</p>
