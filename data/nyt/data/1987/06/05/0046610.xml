        <p>LEAD: The nation's largest retailers reported mixed sales for May yesterday, with some chains ringing up disappointing results that contrasted with April's brisk overall performance.</p>
        <p>The nation's largest retailers reported mixed sales for May yesterday, with some chains ringing up disappointing results that contrasted with April's brisk overall performance.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a mixed bag,'' said Linda Kristiansen, a retailing analyst for Paine Webber. ''It was one of the weaker months so far this year.''</p>
        <p>Sales in May were dampened by a sharp decline in Americans' disposable income and by consumers' widespread efforts to pay debts, Miss Kristiansen and other analysts said.</p>
        <p>''We believe consumer spending remains restrained by continued high installment-debt levels, as well as the adverse effect of some increases in inflation on consumer attitudes,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said: ''Basically, the May sales look soft. It points out that the economy is not running away; that we still see weakness in the economy.'' Sears Sales Up 2.2%</p>
        <p>The industry leader, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, saw its May sales increase only 2.2 percent from May 1986, to $2.262 billion. The weakness largely resulted from the retailer's mix of merchandise, said Ernest L. Arms, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>About 65 percent of Sears's goods include such ''hard goods'' as appliances and furniture, which generally sold more slowly in May than apparel and other items.</p>
        <p>''We were very strong in apparel,'' said Mr. Arms, who cited record sales in women's apparel during the month. He also noted strong gains in sales of refrigerators, freezers, telephones and air-conditioners - the latter particularly in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Other retailers with a larger proportion of apparel also benefited from unseasonably warm weather in some parts of the country, several analysts said. ''Apparel was where the relative strength was,'' said Miss Kristiansen of Paine Webber. A 7.7% Increase for Woolworth</p>
        <p>The F. W. Woolworth Company reported a 7.7 percent increase in May sales from a year earlier, to $508 million. Woolworth's domestic division posted a 6.2 percent sales gain that had exceeded expectations, the company said. Sales of athletic footwear and apparel continued strong in Woolworth's Kinney's Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker operations.</p>
        <p>At the J. C. Penney Company, sales of lingerie, sleepwear, sportswear and general apparel helped increase the company's May sales by 11.2 percent, to $1.042 billion. The third-biggest retailer also reported strong sales in its Mother's Day gift items, led by cosmetics and fragrances, and for accessories.</p>
        <p>Penney's sales were generally strong throughout the month in line with expectations, the company said, noting that promotional activities also bolstered sales.</p>
        <p>Penney ''was promoting very aggressively in the period,'' Mr. Edelman, the Drexel analyst, said. K Mart's Sales Pace Up</p>
        <p>The K Mart Corporation's May sales rose 8.2 percent, to $2.02 billion, and contributed to a sales pace that was 9 percent ahead of 1986, the retailer reported.</p>
        <p>''K Mart's mix is good, and we're pleased with the quality of sales,'' said Bernard Fauber, the chairman of the second-largest retailer. ''We expect to see a pickup in the current sales pace as summer arrives.''</p>
        <p>The Dayton Hudson Corporation saw its sales rise 10.8 percent, to $688.2 million. But the retailer said it was disappointed with weak sales throughout the month at its Mervyn's stores.</p>
        <p>Other major retailers' results for May included:  Wal-Mart Stores Inc., up 35 percent, to $1.281 billion.  Federated Department Stores Inc., up 6.6 percent, to $798.8 million.  May Department Stores Company, up 9.1 percent, to $792 million.  Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, up 3 percent, to $336.8 million.</p>
