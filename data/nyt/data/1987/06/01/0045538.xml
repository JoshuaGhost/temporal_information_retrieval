        <p>LEAD: Officers aboard the American frigate Stark failed to execute a standard air-defense maneuver when she was attacked May 17 by an Iraqi jet in the Persian Gulf, according to Government officials familiar with the Navy investigation of the incident.</p>
        <p>Officers aboard the American frigate Stark failed to execute a standard air-defense maneuver when she was attacked May 17 by an Iraqi jet in the Persian Gulf, according to Government officials familiar with the Navy investigation of the incident.</p>
        <p>Knowing an Iraqi warplane was approaching, the ship's captain did not begin to turn her stern toward the aircraft. That step would have permitted the Stark's sophisticated electronic defenses to detect the launching of two Exocet sea-skimming missiles and to shoot them down.</p>
        <p>It would also have presented the missiles with a smaller, less vital part of the ship as a target, officials said. Ship Had Blind Spot</p>
        <p>Because the ship held a course almost directly toward the Iraqi Mirage F-1 jet, the missiles the plane fired from 12 miles away approached the ship through a blind spot where its superstructure blocked antimissile sensors and weapons, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The officials, who have detailed knowledge of the continuing investigation, provided an extensive description of what happened aboard the Stark in the minutes before the attack, in which 37 American sailors were killed.</p>
        <p>These officials included details previously not disclosed or left unclear. This version indicates that command errors, rather than equipment failure, were to blame for the ship's fate. Officers Could Be Held Culpable</p>
        <p>The Navy has said that the ship never fired, but has not explained exactly why. A Navy spokesman today refused to discuss the matter in detail, pending the conclusion of an investigation that is continuing in Bahrain, where the crippled ship is anchored.</p>
        <p>But officials familiar with the inquiry suggested this weekend that the ship's commander, Capt. Glenn R. Brindel, and perhaps three other officers could be held culpable. The four officers have been named as ''interested parties,'' or primary subjects of the inquiry, and have been assigned legal counsel.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Bahrain on May 20, Captain Brindel said the ship's electronic equipment ''did not detect an incoming missile'' and stressed that the vessel followed standard operational procedures when attacked. A Critical Failure</p>
        <p>''I don't know whether any of it was my fault,'' he said at the time. ''I don't know whether it was the fault of an operator. I don't know if it was was the fault of the equipment. I don't know whether it was an act of God.''</p>
        <p>Blind spots are not unique to any particular type of ship. Weapons cannot be turned to fire through the superstructure, leaving a defensive gap; and no radar, no matter where it is situated, can see through a ship's smokestack.</p>
        <p>Weapon specialists say that because certain of the Stark's sensors were blind toward the front of the ship, its captain and other officers would have been trained to compensate by turning the ship away from an approaching aircraft in order to defend against missile attacks.</p>
        <p>An author and naval analyst, Norman Polmar, said today that the blind spot was due in part to the addition of some sophisticated air defenses to the ship several years after the class of ship was designed. The devices had to be placed where room could be found on deck, he said. U.S. Plans to Send More Ships</p>
        <p>Originally, antimissile defenses were not thought important for the job of guarding escort vessels in the open ocean, where the frigate was designed to operate, he said.</p>
        <p>The Stark was one of seven warships assigned to escort American flag vessels in the Persian Gulf, where Iran and Iraq have mounted frequent attacks on merchant shipping during their six-and-a-half-year war.</p>
        <p>The United States is planning to send more warships to the scene as the escort mission is expanded to include protection for Kuwaiti oil tankers that are to be registered as American ships.</p>
        <p>According to the Pentagon, the Stark never expected to be attacked by an Iraqi aircraft. But the officials said the Stark should have turned away from the jet, which it had identified and tracked from hundreds of miles away, when the plane approached within 40 miles or so. Jet Detected at 200 Miles</p>
        <p>According to the officials familiar with the inquiry, there is no reason to believe the Stark's defensive systems would have missed the incoming Exocet missiles if the ship had been properly positioned. But they said a number of actions taken by the officers manning the weapons and sensors on the Stark had reduced warning time and contributed to the failure to thwart the attack.</p>
        <p>The approaching plane, which had also been detected from afar by an American Awacs early warning plane flying over Saudi Arabia, was picked up by the Stark's air search radar at a distance of about 200 miles.</p>
        <p>According to the officials, a little more than a minute before the first missile hit, a sensitive radar warning receiver on the ship, known as the SLQ-32, detected for the first time that the Mirage had switched its own search radar to a more focused, powerful beam used to pinpoint targets, a clear signal of possible attack.</p>
        <p>But the officials said the captain was not informed of the signal change. The officials would not say whether he had been on the bridge, in the combat control room or elsewhere. Frantic Final Efforts</p>
        <p>Had the officers acted swiftly, the officials said, the Stark still could have turned a few degrees to one side in time to unmask its defensive systems.</p>
        <p>The officers manning the command center - including the executive officer, the tactical action officer and the weapons control officer - moved in the final minute to prepare the ship's defenses. But they could not act in time, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The Navy refused today to identify the three officers because they are subjects of the investigation.</p>
        <p>The officials said the first step taken to defend the Stark was an attempt to better locate the approaching Mirage, using a powerful, narrowly focused radar antenna known as the separate target illumination radar, or STIR, which is behind the main superstructure. This radar might also have detected the launching of the Exocet missiles. Plane Was in Blind Zone</p>
        <p>Had the STIR been focused on the Iraqi warplane, its pilot probably would have realized he was about to be shot at and veered away, the officials suggested. Both before and since the attack, Iraqi pilots have veered aside when they were illuminated by the STIR's distinctive signal.</p>
        <p>But when the tactical action officer gave the order to point the STIR at the Mirage, he was told by the radar operator that the aircraft was in the region where the STIR's view was blocked by the ship's superstructure.</p>
        <p>The radar operator suggested using a less powerful auxiliary radar situated toward the front of the ship, which would not have been blinded by the superstructure. To control the auxiliary radar, however, the officer had to move to a new console and initiate a sequence of commands. He could not do so before the first missile struck.</p>
        <p>The officers attempted two other operations at the same time, according to this chronology. One of them left the command center above deck to remove a safety lock so that metallic particles, called chaff, could be fired into the air in an effort to decoy the Exocet missiles toward a false target.</p>
        <p>They also switched the ship's Phalanx antimissile gun system, its main defense against an Exocet missile, into a mode of operation in which it could track any incoming missile. In that mode, however, the system would not fire automatically.</p>
        <p>Even if it had been switched to fully automatic at this point, officials said, the Phalanx would have been useless because of the angle of the ship to the target. The Phalanx system, a multibarreled gun in a small turret, is designed to fire thousands of heavy, large-caliber rounds into the path of an approaching missile.</p>
