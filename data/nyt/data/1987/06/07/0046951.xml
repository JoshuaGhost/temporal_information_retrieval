        <p>LEAD: MARK DeGARMO made oddly interesting things happen in the works that he and his dancers presented Thursday night at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.</p>
        <p>MARK DeGARMO made oddly interesting things happen in the works that he and his dancers presented Thursday night at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.</p>
        <p>He was particularly inventive in ''Drive with 8's,'' a solo for himself in which he ran and leaped, punching the air and acting like a tough guy. Suddenly, he grew ill at ease. And this was not the nervousness of a fleeing thug, for he looked vulnerable. However, once he let down his guard, he was carefree. As both performer and choreographer, Mr. DeGarmo made these changes fascinating.</p>
        <p>Two group works contained other curious transitions yet suggested that this young choreographer still has trouble developing ideas. The four-part ''Quadratic Ballet,'' to a score by Craig Gordon, was dedicated to the memory of Andreas Weininger, a member of the Bauhaus, the experimental German artists' group of the 1920's.</p>
        <p>The piece's first two sections reflected the love of patterning shared by many Bauhaus artists. Twelve women wearing rectangular headdresses and tutus moved rigidly, then scattered leaping. Chaos appeared to have invaded order. That impression was deceptive, for it soon became clear that everything anyone did was patterned. Nevertheless, the dance implied that patterning need not be constraining.</p>
        <p>After removing the rectangles, the women touched one another gently. But anyone who expected sentimentality would have been astonished to see how affectionate gestures turned into poses recalling wrestling. Unfortunately, Mr. DeGarmo did not continue to explore such kinetic ambiguities. The piece ended with a solo in which Marie Baker-Lee merely posed with a ball and a coy parody of circus acts.</p>
        <p>In ''Dance of Death,'' for Jim Bonner, Osamu Uehara and Josh Walden, gestures made by the dancers with their backs to the audience were interrupted by aggressive thrusts forward. Although his program note indicated that the trio derived from Mexican folk ceremonies, Mr. DeGarmo never put the grotesquerie into a convincing theatrical context.</p>
