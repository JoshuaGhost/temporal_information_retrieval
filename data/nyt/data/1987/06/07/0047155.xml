        <p>LEAD: In recent days, aboard a lumbering armored launch that flew the Stars and Stripes, a Venetian pilot instructed an American Navy helmsman in the art of maneuvering in the choppy Venetian waters.</p>
        <p>In recent days, aboard a lumbering armored launch that flew the Stars and Stripes, a Venetian pilot instructed an American Navy helmsman in the art of maneuvering in the choppy Venetian waters.</p>
        <p>The point of the lesson was to avoid the kind of incident that occurred at the economic summit meeting in Venice in 1980, when a jolt to the yacht on which President Jimmy Carter was riding nearly tossed him into the murky waters.</p>
        <p>The city of canals is a unique conference site. Also unique are the security problems faced by the organizers of the talks that begin here Monday.</p>
        <p>Venice has a lot of water. So an Italian security force of about 8,000 people will include a detachment of frogmen, reinforced by hundreds of security men from Western Europe, the United States and Japan, to make sure that President Reagan and other Western leaders will be safe. Unhappy Gondoliers</p>
        <p>The leaders of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will hold their three-day conference on the Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore, a small private island across the lagoon from St. Mark's Square. Helicopters can land on the island, but the leaders will be brought to the site in motor launches.</p>
        <p>To insure their safety, gondolas and other unauthorized craft will be banned from the stretch of water between St. Mark's and the island and its approaches. But this is vital turf for the gondolieri, who have threatened to slap the city with a bill for $150,000, money they say they're losing through forced inactivity.</p>
        <p>''What's this supposed to mean?'' one of them asked, pacing in front of the Hotel Danieli, ''That to keep my vessel from being crushed between a navy launch and a wall, I'm supposed to take it to bed with me?''</p>
        <p>The gondolieri have been losing ground to the motorboat taxis that are increasingly attracting all but the most sentimental tourists. But the taxi operators are not happy either. 'This Is a Safe Place'</p>
        <p>The entire fleet of some 220 vessels have been pressed into service by summit organizers at a rate the operators say is far below the market price. ''I cost 98,000 lire an hour'' - about $75 -one disgruntled taxi pilot said, steering a visitor in from Marco Polo Airport. ''They're paying a lump sum, and then you have to see whether they pay you, and when.</p>
        <p>''Reagan could walk around here by foot, and nothing would happen to him,'' he added, waving down a dark alley of a canal. ''This is a safe place.''</p>
        <p>The participating nations did not hesitate to send their leaders to Italy. Though the country has been rocked by political violence and Arab terrorist actions in recent years, there have been few violent crimes recently.</p>
        <p>In March, however, terrorists gunned down an Italian Air Force general on a Rome street. This week, as if to display their control of events, the police announced the roundup of several terrorist leaders, including two accused in the Rome shooting. Airport Is Closed</p>
        <p>Despite the successes against terrorists, no one was taking chances. On Friday evening, Venice's airport was closed for one week to unauthorized traffic; and the lagoon, two days before the conference, vaguely evoked the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Italian and American Navy launches plied the waters, and two Italian warships lay at anchor near an American vessel.</p>
        <p>Police helicopters circled the city, and armed vessels of the Guardia di Finanza, or Treasury Guard, a paramilitary force specializing in smugglers, circled Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore.</p>
        <p>The greatest concern appeared to focus on the safety of President Reagan. Today, as the President traveled to Rome to confer with Pope John Paul II and to have lunch with President Francesco Cossiga, Italian officials mobilized 5,000 men to protect him.</p>
        <p>A helicopter landing pad was built at Castel Porziano to enable Mr. Reagan to fly directly to the luncheon site. Circuitous Route</p>
        <p>A motorcade that included members of Mr. Reagan's staff took a circuitous route to avoid highway underpasses that Italian officials said were the preferred ambush sites of terrorists.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in sunny Venice, tourists paraded through the narrow streets and lolled in the open-air restaurants. The crowds will likely melt on Sunday, when delegates to the conference move into the major hotels and large areas are declared off-limits to all but residents.</p>
        <p>That day, President Reagan and his delegation will move down from a villa north of here to the Hotel Cipriani, the best place in Venice for security.</p>
        <p>Last year in Tokyo, the President was lodged in a high-rise hotel; the area had to be cordoned off for blocks around. The Cipriani is on the water's edge facing the conference site, but opposite St. Mark's, where most of the people are. And it is next to the Guardia di Finanza barracks.</p>
