        <p>TALL perennials become floppy, if not staked, particularly peonies, delphiniums, babysbreath, foxgloves and some rudbeckias. Wise pruners save some of the tallest canes and twigs for this purpose; when poked into the ground, these supports hold up floppy herbaceous stems and in time become invisibile. This is a trick used in many famous European gardens. If there are no pruning leftovers, use bamboo stakes, which are inexpensive to buy at garden centers; save nylon stockings to cut up as soft ties. Finish all planting. Put out tender tropical waterlilies in garden pools (their flowers are held high on stems well above the water). Groom rows where spinach, peas, radish and spring onions matured and replant these rows with beets, carrots, chard and, if there is room, another row of beans. Be sure the cucumbers and melons have adequate space. Straighten any corn seedlings knocked over by winds. Check tomato plants for suckers and snip out these unwanted growths between thumb and forefinger. Every few mornings, snap off faded petunias and geraniums to maintain plants and sustain bloom.</p>
        <p>QUESTIONS/ANSWERS  WISTERIA</p>
        <p>Can you tell me why my wisteria did not bloom this year? C..C.K., Eastchester, N.Y.</p>
        <p>There could be several reasons. One of the most common is lack of proper pruning. Now, after the normal flowering season, the vines are pruned. Cut out the main growth tips but allow a few inches of stem to remain. The stems mature and form the flowers for next season. Also, wisteria needs full sun to be at its best. Feed the plants now with a well-balanced fertilizer such as 5-10-5. If the plant has bloomed in prior seasons, these few steps may stimulate bloom in the future. But wisterias that are seedlings may require many years before they bloom. TOO BIG AZALEA</p>
        <p>Azaleas in front of our house are blocking out light into the living room. I would like to cut them back, but I don't want to kill them. What do you recommend? C.C. Closter, N.J.</p>
        <p>A good sharp pruning shears. Pruning now is the best thing for the azaleas. These twiggy shrubs can be pruned hard and reshaped to suit their original space. Step back a few times to examine the reshaping of the shrubs and make sure all pruning cuts are flush with the main stem; do not leave any stubs. Then feed the azaleas with an acid-type fertilizer and water them well during any dry periods in the summer. They should come back and bloom well in future years. CONTAINER CROPS</p>
        <p>We have a sunny corner on our terrace and would like to grow a few crops. Any suggestions? B.L.L., Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Set out plants, not seed, of lettuce, tomatoes such as the popular variety Patio, beets, onions (sets for scallions), peppers, especially the hot sorts and most herbs. Try cucumbers, if there is a fence to support the vines. Avoid tall or spreading crops such as corn, melons, winter squash and beans. ASTERS/YELLOWS</p>
        <p>I have never had success with asters which I recall with fondest memories from my grandmother's garden. I try every year and buy healthy plants, but by midsummer, they yellow, never bloom and die. Is there something in the soil? Mrs. S.S., Madison, Conn.</p>
        <p>Possibly. As a practical matter, next year select a different sunny location to plant the asters. Although some of the newer asters, such as the Powderpuff series, bloom exceptionally well, this annual is generally subject to wilt disease which remains in the soil. Also, aster yellows, a virus-disease, is spread by the feeding of leafhoppers which suck sap from aster leaves and act as vectors of the virus. Once asters start to yellow and fade, pull them up and discard the plants. Do not compost them. FUCHSIA</p>
        <p>How do we care for a gift fuchsia that is beautiful now. We don't want to lose it. Mrs. P.O., Rye, N.Y.</p>
        <p>If the fuchsia is in a hanging planter, and a shade tree has a low hanging branch, the fuchsia can be hung on the tree and summered outdoors. Be sure that the plant never dries out and feed it every two to three weeks with a weak dilution of water-soluble fertilizer. Cut off blooms promptly when they fade to keep the plant blooming. The local hot summer weather may cause the plant to vegetate, but not bloom. It should bloom again in cooler weather. Before taking the fuchsia indoors, check it as it may need spraying for white fly control and place in a bright window for a few weeks. Then cut the plant back to several inches, move it to a cool place and keep it dormant for two or more months. Start the growing cycle in late winter, when there is more daylight. ROSES</p>
        <p>We are moving to a new house in Vermont at the end of the summer and would like to take our rosebushes with us. When should we dig them? Mrs. D.F., Rye, N.Y. Summer is one of the worst times to move roses as they are in full growth and blooming now. Also, Vermont can have severe winters and the rosebushes may not survive if the new garden is in a colder hardiness zone. It would be best for the roses - and new garden - if the roses remained where they are and new rosebushes were obtained with hardiness for the new garden. Sometimes Vermont rose gardens have to be protected very carefully in early fall to bring them through the winter months.</p>
