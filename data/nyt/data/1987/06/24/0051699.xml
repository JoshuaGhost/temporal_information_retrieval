        <p>LEAD: If all goes well for Joseph R. Hardiman tomorrow, he will be named the next president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry group that oversees trading in over-the-counter stocks.</p>
        <p>If all goes well for Joseph R. Hardiman tomorrow, he will be named the next president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry group that oversees trading in over-the-counter stocks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardiman, according to people in the industry, is the choice to succeed Gordon J. Macklin, who is leaving the presidency after 17 years to become chairman and co-chief executive of the Hambrecht &amp; Quist Group of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The N.A.S.D. board will meet tommorow in Washington to make its selection known. Mr. Hardiman is now the board's chairman, an unpaid post that he would leave for the paid full-time president's job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardiman, 50 years old, is chief operating officer at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, a Baltimore securities firm. He had been chairman of the committee searching for a new N.A.S.D. president until last month, when he decided to be a candidate himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardiman would be taking over the N.A.S.D., which is the self-regulator of its industry, at a time that all markets are scrutinizing their practices because of concerns over insider trading. As N.A.S.D. chairman, he has been reviewing the organization's regulatory practices.</p>
        <p>Another concern for the N.A.S.D. is increased competition from international markets where a move toward global stock trading is gathering momentum. The N.A.S.D. has been moving into international trading, and one weakness of Mr. Hardiman, according to industry observers, might be his lack of international exposure. ''A man from a small firm in Baltimore will now be dealing with Singapore,'' said Peter J. Da Puzzo, senior executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Da Puzzo added that international trading was in its infancy and Mr. Hardiman had plenty of time to learn. Mr. Da Puzzo called Mr. Hardiman a good choice because of his broad background as a lawyer and administrator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardiman declined to discuss issues facing the the N.A.S.D. until after the voting. He has been chief operating officer at Alex. Brown since it became a public company in 1984, having already been a partner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown was born on Maryland's Eastern Shore and went to the University of Maryland. He practiced law in Baltimore for five years before joining Robert Garrett &amp; Sons, a brokerage firm, and moving on to Alex. Brown.</p>
