        <p>LEAD: IN just over a week, the annual showdown between New York City landlords and tenants will reach its rowdy and often rancourous climax.</p>
        <p>IN just over a week, the annual showdown between New York City landlords and tenants will reach its rowdy and often rancourous climax.</p>
        <p>Members of the city's Rent Guidelines Board will vote June 23 on whether and by how much rents will rise for leases on stabilized apartments signed between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 30, 1988. Leases on about half of the 943,000 stabilized apartments are expected to be signed during that period.</p>
        <p>Board members weigh several factors before voting. They look at an independent study of what it costs owners to run their buildings. They evaluate the supply of apartments. But they give special weight to the testimony and presentations of tenant and landlord lobbyists who, though little known to the general public, wield substantial influence on the board.</p>
        <p>For sheer contentiousness, few regularly scheduled public hearings can match the proceedings before the nine-member Rent Guidelines Board, which is composed of both owner and tenant representatives, as well as five members who represent the public interest. In past years, landlords and tenants have shouted threats at one another and have been put out of the chamber by the police. This year, the hearings were a bit more subdued, although the rhetoric veered off at times into full-scale debates on capitalism, equality and social justice.</p>
        <p>Individuals can appear before the board and state their case, but the four major groups representing owners and renters orchestrate most of the proceedings.</p>
        <p>The largest and, in terms of its budget, most powerful of these groups is the Rent Stabilization Association, which, despite its ambiguous name, represents only one side - 24,500 of the major residential property owners in the city, including most of the largest landlords. Association officials would not reveal the organization's budget, or its officials' salaries, but it is known that members pay a $2.74-per-apartment annual fee. The association's members own 920,000 apartments, which suggests an annual budget of about $2.5 million. Throughout the year, the association commissions studies by private consultants and runs full-page newspaper ads to outline its positions. Its 26 employees work in a suite of offices on Times Square.</p>
        <p>Before 1984, the Rent Stabilization Association actually administered the rent-stabilization system, an example of industry self-regulation. After the Omnibus Housing Act was passed in 1984, the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal took over the system. The association then became a voluntary organization that actively represented the interests of New York landlords.</p>
        <p>THE president of the association, John J. Gilbert 3d, is a registered lobbyist who frequently goes to Albany to present the landlords' views on rent regulation to the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert is no stranger to the Capitol. He began his career there in 1977 as a legislative aide to Assemblyman Edward H. Lehner, a Manhattan Democrat, who was then chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee. In 1978, a year after graduating from Cornell University with a degree in economics and public policy, he ran unsucessfully for the State Assembly in his home district in southern Erie County.</p>
        <p>He returned to the Assembly as a member of the majority staff and remained until 1981 and then took a job as assistant commissioner for housing in the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Later, he was named the Mayor's representative on the Board of Estimate, a position in which he presided over the board in the Mayor's absence.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1985, Mr. Gilbert was approached by an executive recruitment firm and offered the presidency of the Rent Stabilization Association. At first, he was not interested.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people advised me there was no future representing property owners in New York,'' Mr. Gilbert said.</p>
        <p>Eventually, he changed his mind and took the job. Since then he has become a familiar figure at the guidelines board hearings, usually sitting in his shirtsleeves at the rear of the auditorium talking to property owners.</p>
        <p>His turn to directly address the board usually comes at the outset of the hearings. This year, Mr. Gilbert stood up and tore a dollar bill in half, saying that owners were receiving only about half of what they received in rent in 1971, after adjustments for inflation. He insisted that that landlords need larger increases to run their buildings.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the month, the association had requested increases of 14 percent for one-year leases and 18 percent for two-year leases. In addition, it wants rents on vacated apartments to rise to market levels before coming under stabilization restrictions again. The association also is seeking additional increases for apartments with rents below $400 and those with tenants in occupancy for more than eight years.</p>
        <p>At the same meeting at which Mr. Gilbert spoke, Jane Benedict, a 75-year-old activist involved in the tenant-rights movement since 1958, urged the board to freeze rents without granting any increases. Ms. Benedict is a founder and honorary chairwoman of the Metropolitan Council on Housing.</p>
        <p>Like other tenant leaders, Ms. Benedict first got involved when her own Yorkville neighborhood was threatened by clearance and rising prices. A former organizer with the United Office and Professional Workers of America (now defunct), Ms. Benedict helped form a coalition of neighborhood groups that went to Albany to testify at rent control hearings.</p>
        <p>The coalition evolved into the Metropolitan Council on Housing, which has become one of the city's most radical tenant groups, advocating that all low- and middle-income housing be placed in the public domain.</p>
        <p>Ms. Benedict, who lives in a single-family house in Yonkers, has for years been among the most visible tenant advocates, popping up in Albany or at City Hall at almost every demonstration or protest.</p>
        <p>Though still evident at public hearings, she recently withdrew from active leadership. Susan Radosh, a 29-year-old organizer who lives in a city-owned building in Washington Heights, is current co-chairwoman, along with Bess Stevenson. Ms. Radosh's salary is $13,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The council reports that it has just under 10,000 members who pay dues of up to $15 a year. This gives it an annual budget of about $80,000, said Ms. Benedict. Three paid staff members work with volunteers to operate a telephone information line, publish a newsletter, organize tenants and plan activities.</p>
        <p>Two floors above the council's office at 198 Broadway is the office of the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, which says it represents 120 tenant organizations in public and private housing. It also claims to have 2,000 individual members. The organizations pay yearly dues of $25 to $200, and individuals pay $10 to $20 per year. The coalition's total annual income is about $70,000.</p>
        <p>THE executive director of the coalition, Michael McKee, is a 47-year-old organizer who has been involved in tenants' rights since 1970 when he and other tenants of a Chelsea building went on a rent strike. They eventually took ownership of the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKee had set out on a career in film production, but said he changed directions after he found out he had ''a talent for organizing.'' In 1974, he started the New York State Tenants Coalition. The name was later changed to add neighborhoods. When the Legislature is in session, the Coalition is represented in Albany by James Garst, a registered lobbyist.</p>
        <p>In addition to his work with the coalition, Mr. McKee, who rents an apartment in Chelsea, also is executive director of the Community Resource and Training Center, a nonprofit organization that receives money from private foundations and the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development to train tenant organizers and to study bank investment policies.</p>
        <p>Landlord groups have criticized this use of public funds. They say the city, in effect, is subsidizing Mr. McKee and his group, which then appears before the rent board to represent the tenants' point of view.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKee insisted that the two organizations are legally unaffiliated, even though he heads both, they are in the same office and each contributes $12,000 to his $24,000 annual salary. Because of Internal Revenue Service rulings, private foundations are prohibited from giving money to organizations that engage in lobbying. Mr. McKee explained that this is the reason a separate group had to be incorporated.</p>
        <p>Paul A. Crotty, Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that he did not consider the $37,000-a-year contract his department has with the Community Resource and Training Center to be a conflict.</p>
        <p>''The landlords' way of portraying this arrangement is unfair,'' Mr. Crotty said. ''We never thought that by entering into a contract with us these groups were giving up their rights.''</p>
        <p>For their part, tenant advocates have accused the owners of their own subterfuge. The city's biggest landlords do not appear before the Rent Guidelines Board, except in the person of Mr. Gilbert, who owns only his single-family house in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>Instead, the hearings are attended primarily by small property owners, many of them members of minority groups who are barely making ends meet and who make much more compelling arguments for increases. Tenants have said that the Rent Stabilization Association subsidizes another group, the Small Property Owners of New York. State Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan, said big landlords use small owners ''as cannon fodder'' before the board.</p>
        <p>THE president of the Small Property Owners of New York, Roberta Bernstein, said there is no legal or financial connection between her group and the Rent Stabilization Association. She sits on the board of directors of the association, but her own organization receives no funds from the larger group. Many of the 1,200 dues-paying members the group claims to have also belong to the association. The organization's annual income is about $50,000. Mrs. Bernstein receives no salary as president.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bernstein, 43, is a former teacher who, with her husband, purchased a five-family brownstone on the Upper East Side in 1971. Over the next eight years, they bought four more buildings. She quit teaching to manage the total of 47-units full time.</p>
        <p>She said that frequent encounters with the rent-regulatory system and Housing Court convinced her that small owners were not getting fair treatment. Believing that they also were being ignored by the Rent Stabilization Association, she met with other owners groups and established a citywide organization of landlords who own fewer than 50 units and manage their buildings themselves.</p>
        <p>The members pay annual dues of $50, or $25 if they are over 65. The office Mrs. Bernstein uses to manage her property also serves as the group's office, and there is one paid employee, a parttime clerk.</p>
        <p>In addition to the advocates' testimony, Rent Guidelines Board members consider the results of a survey of costs conducted by an independent consultant. This year the consultant performed the work without charge after the city's Board of Estimate refused to approve the $180,000 contract. The survey -sometimes called the owners' price index -determines how much the cost of goods and services in an owner's operation and maintenance budget have increased.</p>
        <p>The increase this year was estimated to be 2.1 percent. Over the past few years, the Rent Guidelines Board has approved increases for one-year leases that have come close to matching the price index.</p>
