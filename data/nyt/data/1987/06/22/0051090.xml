        <p>THE New York City Ballet production of ''Coppelia'' skipped into the New York State Theater on Wednesday, just in time for the hot weather. Derived from Marius Petipa's version of the ballet, this production's choreography and staging by George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova, performed to the traditional score by Delibes, catches some of the dark tones of the Hoffman tale that inspired the ballet. But the production was actually created for the company's 1974 season in the outdoor amphitheater of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the company's summer home. And it is a frothy, amusing delight that is a perfect hot weather treat for children and adults.</p>
        <p>Patricia McBride led Wednesday's cast, dancing the role of the willful and exuberant young villager Swanilda, which she created for the Balanchine-Danilova production and in which she was coached by Miss Danilova, a legendary Swanilda. Ms. McBride has danced more excitingly and with more resilience than she did here in the first act. But her second act, in which she pretends to be a doll who has come alive in the workshop of the mad old Dr. Coppelius, stood out for the naughty humor of her dancing, particularly her pointwork. And she was her usual radiant, exultant self in the third-act wedding pas de deux, triumphantly emphatic in her jumps on point.</p>
        <p>Ib Andersen has also danced more excitingly than he did here as Franz, Swanilda's boyish, hesitant suitor. There was little dramatic coloring or detail in his portrayal of the character, and Mr. Andersen made Franz's difficult but exhilarating variation in the pas de deux look merely difficult and dull. But there was fine dancing from the soloists in the wedding act.</p>
        <p>Leading little girls from the School of American Ballet, Stacy Caddell brought her typical richness and musicality to the Waltz of the Golden Hours, though some of her ports de bras were slightly affected. Helene Alexopoulos danced the Prayer solo with memorable lyricism and fluency. The Spinner and Dawn solos were danced brightly by Lauren Hauser and Melinda Roy, respectively, and Diana White and the appealingly cocky Damian Woetzel led the Discord and War melee with just the right vigor.</p>
        <p>Playing the toys in Dr. Coppelius's workshop is usually a pretty thankless job, and it is a little sad sometimes to see promising young dancers like Brian Reeder, the Astrologer here, weighted with costuming and playing automatons. But a glint of individualism shines through occasionally, as it did here in Ben Huys's Acrobat, in movement and gesture that had a quietly arresting hint of the rooted but expansive modern dance of the Wigman school.</p>
        <p>As usual, however, the real star of the ballet was Shaun O'Brien. His Coppelius has grown less sad and maniacal over the years, but he still, blessedly, never stoops to the cute touches that demean and deaden many interpretations of the role. There is great if somewhat subdued acting going on here, filled with sensitively conceived and realized detail and color.</p>
        <p>Robert Irving conducted.</p>
