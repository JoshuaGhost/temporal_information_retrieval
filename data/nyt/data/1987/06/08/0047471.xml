        <p>LEAD: As Italy's campaign for parliamentary elections enters its last week, the Socialist Party is blitzing the airwaves with something of a novelty: four television spots showing former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi being questioned by a mock interviewer on different topics.</p>
        <p>As Italy's campaign for parliamentary elections enters its last week, the Socialist Party is blitzing the airwaves with something of a novelty: four television spots showing former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi being questioned by a mock interviewer on different topics.</p>
        <p>In one spot, he is asked about his stand on nuclear energy, and replies by referring to Soviet nuclear accident with earnest folksiness, ''Well, after Chernobyl even I was frightened, and I don't think I am someone who frightens easily,'' he said. Through most of the postwar era the major political parties, especially the Communists and Christian Democrats, have drawn strength from patronage and grass-roots organization. Small parties have based themselves on ideas, like the Republicans with their centrist view of good government.</p>
        <p>But the Socialists have now introduced a new element: televised advertisements focusing on the personalities and sometimes the policies of a major candidate, which are a standard feature in most Western democracies.</p>
        <p>''One of the great unknowns in this campaign,'' says Carlo Santoro, a political scientist at Milan University, ''is the degree to which Italy has moved toward a more personalized form of politics, something closer to U.S.-style politics. Craxi's fate will be an important test.''</p>
        <p>Many studies have shown that most Italians have strong party loyalties, sometimes handed down from one generation to the next. This kind of voter is rarely influenced by the emergence of a new political personality.</p>
        <p>''Craxi is fighting the system,'' Mr. Santoro said. ''He is gambling that the dynamics of Italian society have change sufficiently for personality to outweigh party affiliations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Craxi is alone in this wager. While the Socialist spots focus entirely on him, the ads of every other party emphasize its institutional character, not its leaders. This also reflects the fact that the Socialists are the only party with a leader of proven appeal.</p>
        <p>In the most successful moments of his three and half years as Prime Minister, Mr. Craxi dramatically outscored all rivals in popularity polls, and he won a degree of personal approval rarely held by an Italian leader.</p>
        <p>But his personal appeal has to count for a great deal if the Socialists are to win more than 12 percent of the vote, the level they have been stuck at in parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>In this campaign, Mr. Craxi has emphasized his Government's accomplishments, especially bringing inflation down from an annual rate of 16 percent in 1983 to its current level of just over 4 percent. Although his five-party Government resigned on March 3, he is running virtually as if he were an incumbent in an American presidential election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Craxi has promoted himself as the only politician tough enough to handle Italy's problems. He defined his style of governing as ''decisionismo,'' decisiveness raised to an ideology.</p>
        <p>His popularity reached its high points with appeals to Italian nationalism that were unprecedented in the postwar period.</p>
        <p>Both during the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in 1985 and after the United States bombing raid on Libya in 1986, Mr. Craxi used a stern, ready-to-fight speaking style to project himself as the unintimidated champion of Italian sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Since the fall of Mussolini, no Italian politician has used such a muscular image, and political cartoonists have routinely portrayed Mr. Craxi in a black shirt and riding boots as a modern-day ''Duce.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Craxi's supporters believe that the tough-guy image was a necessity. Gianni Muccini, a Milan advertising executive who has helped prepare Socialist campaign materials, said: ''Craxi had to be strong to prove that the leader of a small party could govern Italy. He had to show that he was really in command.''</p>
        <p>The loud, finger-waving style was in keeping with the traditional Italian politics based on big rallies. But rallies draw declining crowds now, and Mr. Craxi is developing another persona, speaking in an easy tone and smiling readily in his television spots.</p>
