        <p>LEAD: When Leroy Horn was a substitute running back as a sophomore at Montclair State in 1985, he went into a football game against Jersey City State early in the second half as a replacement for a starter who had suffered a rib injury. Horn, a 5-foot-10-inch, 190-pound tailback, proceeded to gain 310 yards and score on touchdown runs of 58, 75 and 58 yards.</p>

        <p>When Leroy Horn was a substitute running back as a sophomore at Montclair State in 1985, he went into a football game against Jersey City State early in the second half as a replacement for a starter who had suffered a rib injury. Horn, a 5-foot-10-inch, 190-pound tailback, proceeded to gain 310 yards and score on touchdown runs of 58, 75 and 58 yards. At the time, no records were kept for yards rushing in one half of an N.C.A.A. Division III game, but his yardage total was only 63 yards short of the record for an entire game.</p>
        <p>Horn had no doubts about his running ability. In 1983 as a senior at Summit High School, he gained 1,280 yards to break the single-season record of 1,093 set 10 years earlier by Willie Wilson, now the center fielder for the Kansas City Royals baseball team. Just to be sure that Wilson didn't forget him, Horn also broke the star's record for triples in a baseball season, slapping two more than the nine that Wilson totaled in 1974.</p>
        <p>The athletic department at Montclair State recruited Horn for both football and baseball and so far he hasn't let them down. After his flashy start in football, as a junior he became the team's leading ground gainer with 1,266 yards (an average of 4.5 a game) and scored seven touchdowns last fall as the Indians won 10 of 12 games and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Division III tournament. This spring, in his first varsity baseball season, Horn was the center fielder and batted .325 with four home runs during the regular season.</p>
        <p>He saved his best efforts for the Division III tournament at Marietta (Ohio) College, where the Indians won the national championship with four straight victories. In them, Horn rapped six hits, including two home runs good for six runs.</p>
        <p>Horn's two-run homer in the bottom of the 10th inning on Sunday lifted Montclair to a 13-12 victory over Wisconsin-Oshkosh that won the championship.</p>
        <p>''Words can't describe how I felt about hitting that homer,'' said Horn yesterday. ''I thought I felt good about gaining all those yards in football, but that home run just clean wiped all the other thrills right out of my mind.''  SCOUTING</p>
