        <p>LEAD: A Florida probate judge cleared the way yesterday for Donald J. Trump, the New York developer, to buy control of Resorts International Inc., the hotel and gambling casino operator, for $101 million in cash.</p>
        <p>A Florida probate judge cleared the way yesterday for Donald J. Trump, the New York developer, to buy control of Resorts International Inc., the hotel and gambling casino operator, for $101 million in cash.</p>
        <p>Judge Harold G. Featherstone of Dade County Probate Court approved the Trump deal over competing bids from Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman; Manos Sarantopoulos, a Greek businessman, and a group headed by Francis Purcell, a New York lawyer. The court took jurisdiction because the founder and controlling stockholder of Resorts International, James M. Crosby, was a resident of Florida at the time of his death in 1986.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump, who viewed Mr. Davis as his only serious competition, said the court's decision was a ''major upset for Marvin Davis,'' who, he added, was ''most intent on obtaining'' Resorts' casino at Paradise Island in the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>The developer is thought to have been selected because of his ability to take on construction of the company's vast Taj Mahal casino-hotel in Atlantic City. Its cost has been estimated as high as $800 million.</p>
        <p>In the decision that made the deal possible, Judge Featherstone approved a contract giving Mr. Trump the right to buy 390,783 shares of class B stock from the Crosby estate at $135 a share. That block alone represents 48 percent of the voting power of the company's class A and class B stock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump would pay the same price for an additional 194,000 Class B shares owned by the Crosby family and is expected to announce a tender offer in about a month, after the estate deal is concluded, to buy about 170,000 class B shares owned by the public. There are no plans to buy the class A stock.</p>
        <p>The Purcell group had offered $210 a share, and Mr. Sarantopoulos an estimated $170, while Mr. Davis had offered $140 plus an interest in the business.</p>
