        <p>LEAD: ''This is a battle against disease, not against our fellow Americans.'' In his first speech devoted to AIDS, President Reagan made plain that his heart was in the right place. What's less evident is why he ignores the best advice of public health officials and recommends compulsory AIDS testing that has little relevance to the incidence of the disease.</p>
        <p>''This is a battle against disease, not against our fellow Americans.'' In his first speech devoted to AIDS, President Reagan made plain that his heart was in the right place. What's less evident is why he ignores the best advice of public health officials and recommends compulsory AIDS testing that has little relevance to the incidence of the disease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan would like to see the AIDS test applied to immigrants, Federal prisoners, patients at veterans' hospitals, people getting married and those attending sexual disease clinics. Apart from prison populations containing drug addicts, these are not the groups at highest risk for AIDS.</p>
        <p>As for premarital testing, the Federal Centers for Disease Control finds that it ''is unlikely to be very effective,'' because most AIDS victims are drug addicts and homosexuals and the incidence of marriage among these groups is low. * * *</p>
        <p>There is historical precedent and good reason for testing and excluding would-be immigrants with communicable diseases. And offering the AIDS test to those attending sexual disease clinics makes excellent sense if it is voluntary. Otherwise, all that would accomplish is to discourage people from attending the clinics.</p>
        <p>That's why Mr. Reagan's emphasis on compulsory testing is counterproductive. Public health officials prefer voluntary testing lest they drive away the high-risk groups they most need to reach. To encourage wider voluntary testing, the Government needs to provide firmer guarantees of confidentiality and protection from discrimination. Mr. Reagan warned against discrimination but offered no specific ways to deter it.</p>
        <p>Why test? The AIDS virus, he said, ''is surreptitiously spreading throughout our population.'' The question of spread needs to be addressed by wider AIDS testing, but a scientifically designed program would be preferable to the miscellaneous testing the President advocates. Besides, Mr. Reagan's emphasis on testing is misplaced. There are much more important things to do first.</p>
        <p>One is to encourage changes of behavior, to prevent people from acquiring the virus and from passing it on. That calls for a widespread public education program, something the Federal Government is ideally situated to conduct. Yet Mr. Reagan seems willing to leave that task to the ad hoc efforts of states, schools and private businesses.</p>
        <p>After education should come voluntary testing, accompanied by counseling, which is what makes a testing program effective in changing people's behavior regardless of test results. Washington could encourage wider voluntary testing in many ways, none of them cited by Mr. Reagan.</p>
        <p>If a wide program of education and voluntary testing had been tried and failed, there might be grounds to consider the merits of compulsory testing, whether one calls it ''mandatory'' or ''routine.'' Mr. Reagan's Administration has been slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic, yet its first thought is to compel testing. That is inconsistent with what public health officials advise and with the compassion evident in Mr. Reagan's words.</p>
