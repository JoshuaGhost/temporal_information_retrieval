        <p>LEAD: ''One hundred seems to be a very lucky number,'' said George Abbott last night. ''One of the great things is that everybody loves you.'' And indeed the entire theater world seemed to be expressing love for Mr. Abbott at a gala 100th-birthday party for the producer-director-writer-actor at Broadway's Palace</p>
        <p>''One hundred seems to be a very lucky number,'' said George Abbott last night. ''One of the great things is that everybody loves you.'' And indeed the entire theater world seemed to be expressing love for Mr. Abbott at a gala 100th-birthday party for the producer-director-writer-actor at Broadway's Palace Theater.</p>
        <p>Most people don't have monthlong birthday parties, but most people don't have a Pulitzer Prize, a pocketful of Tonys and a list of credits that reads like a glossary of the 20th-century American theater.</p>
        <p>Last night's celebration brought together dozens of theater-world luminaries who have worked with Mr. Abbott over the decades, a handful of family members, and some 1,600 guests. Several generations of proteges took the stage to pay tribute in song, dance and comedy to a man whose prodigious productivity has made his name a seemingly permanent feature on Broadway marquis.</p>
        <p>As Arthur Rubin sang ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,'' 18 of Mr. Abbott's ''leading ladies''- including Elizabeth Ashley, Lillian Gish, Kitty Carlisle Hart and Butterfly McQueen- came onstage against a backdrop of oversized playbills from 48 Abbott productions. Songs from a melange of Abbott musicals were sung, and accolades were offered by many alumni of George Abbott shows.</p>
        <p>These included Helen Hayes, whose performance in Mr. Abbott's ''Coquette'' 60 years ago was a career milestone; Harold Prince, whose career began as Mr. Abbott's office boy 39 years ago; Garson Kanin, the writer and director who was Mr. Abbott's assistant director in the mid-1930's for ''Room Service,'' ''Boy Meets Girl'' and other productions; Jerome Robbins, who co-directed ''Pajama Game'' with Mr. Abbott 35 years ago; the lyricists Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and Donald Saddler, a choreographer and longtime collaborator, who is doing the musical staging for the revival of Mr. Abbott's 1926 melodrama, ''Broadway.'' The play opens Thursday at the Royale Theater.</p>
        <p>Reminiscences were offered by Jose Ferrer, Nanette Fabray, and Carol Channing, who proclaimed the evening ''not a birthday but an event.'' Edie Adams sang ''It's Love'' from ''Wonderful Town,'' and Chita Rivera, one of many artists who received a first big break from Mr. Abbott, performed a dance number from ''Call Me Madam.''</p>
        <p>After Joy Abbott sang ''Bewitched,'' her husband came onstage to a standing ovation. He expressed bemusement because ''Strangers come up to me and say I'm an inspiration.''</p>
        <p>The onstage celebration ended at about 11, but was to continue at a private supper party at Roseland.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day at his Rockefeller Center office, Mr. Abbott said he was ''working on a few things,'' including a musical having to do with Frankenstein. But his top priority was to take a long vacation at his summer house in the Catskills - undoubtedly to unwind after weeks of birthday festivities.</p>
