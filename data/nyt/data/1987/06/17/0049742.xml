        <p>LEAD: One day recently, John Ullman perched on a rock near the mouth of the mighty Columbia River in Oregon and ate a small mountain of sturgeon caviar. ''It was, literally, that day's catch,'' he said happily later. ''Where else could I be doing this?''</p>
        <p>One day recently, John Ullman perched on a rock near the mouth of the mighty Columbia River in Oregon and ate a small mountain of sturgeon caviar. ''It was, literally, that day's catch,'' he said happily later. ''Where else could I be doing this?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman and his family moved to Oregon from Seattle in search of just such culinary adventures two years ago. On their 40-acre farm in Rainier, they mix local raspberries with bittersweet chocolate to yield a rich dessert topping. They hunt for wild grapes to make into vinegar. They scour the nearby woods for white truffles, then experiment with ways to ''celebrate them'' with friends, Mr. Ullman said.</p>
        <p>The Ullmans' Farm at Rainier also serves as headquarters for their fledgling specialty foods company, Bonaventura. It is one of a growing number of new family-run specialty food vendors in a state that seems to be embracing hospitality as a way of life - or as a way to pay the bills.</p>
        <p>Oregon's specialty foods industry has grown so rapidly in the last two years that the State Agriculture Department has lost count of the companies now in business. Dalton Hobbs, a spokesman for the department, estimated the number of Oregon specialty food products at about 250, ''but another jam or chutney or vinegar seems to be introduced every time I turn around,'' he said. Oregon also has more than 50 bonded wineries.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, Oregon officials are using these fruits of the land and the vine to tantalize outsiders in an aggressive state marketing effort. Over the next two months, for example, visitors to Bloomingdale's in New York can eat and drink Oregon to their hearts' content. The promotion was underwritten with $150,000 in state funds, and features the state's finest foods and wines. Twenty Oregon vendors are heading for New York to demonstrate their wares as part of the promotion. ''Some of them will have to stay at the Y to make the trip, but it's worth it to them,'' Mr. Hobbs said.</p>
        <p>In a companion project, video segments have been filmed for Cable News Network at sites like Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood and the Columbia Gorge Hotel in the Columbia River Gorge. Each destination is a backdrop for Oregon products.</p>
        <p>''Food and tourism,'' Mr. Hobbs said, ''are a natural match. We are a state of unspoiled sophisticates, and we're eager to tell our story'' - preferably, he might have added, over a plate of chinook salmon and a glass of Oregon pinot noir.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Oregonians seem more willing now to share their state with outsiders than they used to be. Lynn Barra, owner of the Paradigm Chocolate Company, remembers 20 years ago when Oregon was best known for the ''visit but don't stay'' message spread nationwide by Gov. Tom McCall. He was actually trying to tantalize outsiders to come and experience Oregon.</p>
        <p>The late Mr. McCall - whose era also ushered in the Oregon bottle bill, state land-use planning and enough environmental ideas to make Oregon synonymous with ''ecotopia'' - was, as some see it, a marketing genius who piqued interest in a little-known Eden. People came to Oregon in droves, and the state's last significant population surge came during and just after the McCall administration.</p>
        <p>Since the end of the 1970's, however, Oregon's timber-based economy has been limping more than soaring. Between 1981 and 1983, the nadir of the last recession, 65,000 people moved out of the state. Some of the sawmills that once kept Oregon's economy humming closed permanently or reduced their labor pool.</p>
        <p>Now, a new governor has announced that the ''Oregon comeback'' is officially under way. Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, who was Transportation Secretary during the Carter Administration, knows a thing or two about marketing. Before running for Governor he was an executive with Nike, the sports shoe giant.</p>
        <p>The food industry is given special emphasis in his plan, and well it should be: agriculture ranks among the state's top three industries.</p>
        <p>Oregon foods haven't enjoyed such renown since James Beard, a native son, had his ''Delights and Prejudices'' published by Atheneum in 1964. His boyhood memories, he wrote, were flavored by recollections of ''great razor clams, succulent Dungeness crab, the salmon, crawfish, mussels of the Oregon coast.''</p>
        <p>Most Oregon food processors are wary of fiddling too much with what nature still so generously supplies. ''We have an image of being wholesome and natural, not faddish,'' said Brian Douglass, founder of the Pacific Northwest Specialty Foods Association.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Barra of Paradigm Chocolate sees in Oregon's specialty foods a reflection of its citizenry. ''We were the forerunners in the area of ecology, and in our products you see a lot of quality consciousness,'' she said. ''We don't take short cuts. We don't use preservatives. We don't use extracts. We say proudly that our product will mold.''</p>
        <p>About Oregon products, Mr. Ullman said: ''You know just who's doing the cooking. They're stick-in-the-muds, they have integrity, they have character. And they don't apologize for any of it.''</p>
        <p>Given enough time, he said, Oregonians just might cook up a new cuisine based on the abundance of local foodstuffs. ''It may take 10 years of serious eating,'' he admitted, ''but I can't imagine a better place to get to work.''</p>
