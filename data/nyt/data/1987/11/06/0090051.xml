        <p>LEAD: A major financial services concern, Integrated Resources Inc., signed a long-term lease yesterday to occupy all of the office space at Zeckendorf Towers, the 27-story office and apartment complex that dominates the Union Square area.</p>
        <p>A major financial services concern, Integrated Resources Inc., signed a long-term lease yesterday to occupy all of the office space at Zeckendorf Towers, the 27-story office and apartment complex that dominates the Union Square area.</p>
        <p>The deal for the $20 million, 25-year lease was made possible by New York City's agreement to issue $70 million in industrial revenue bonds to help finance the project. It means that Integrated Resources, the 22d-largest financial services company in the world, will not be leaving the city.</p>
        <p>''Our decision means that from 900 to 1,500 jobs will stay where we are convinced they belong - in the heart of New York City,'' said Selig Zises, the chairman of Integrated Resources.</p>
        <p>The deal also means that the rejuvenation of Union Square, an area that had slipped into grimy disrepair, will continue, according to Robert McGrath, a spokesman for the city's deputy mayor for finance and development, Alair A. Townsend.</p>
        <p>''Union Square is a Cinderella,'' Mr. McGrath said, ''and Integrated's announcement means that the area is not going to turn back, at the stroke of midnight, into what it was. Former Site of S. Klein</p>
        <p>''You had vacancy rates, a real dropoff in business,'' Mr. McGrath continued. ''You had drug dealing and petty crime in the park. But the park was reclaimed. And clearly now you're going to have workers in the area, which will mean new retail activity, restaurants.''</p>
        <p>Zeckendorf Towers occupies the entire block - bounded by East 14th Street, Irving Place, Union Square East and East 15th Street - on which the S. Klein department store once stood. It consists of four 20-story towers, with pyramidal peaks, standing on a seven-story commercial base. The four towers contain about 650 condominium apartments.</p>
        <p>Under the lease, Integrated will occupy all 362,500 square feet of office space at what is officially designated as 10 Union Square East. Integrated now occupies two midtown locations - at 666 Third Avenue, at 43d Street, and 733 Third Avenue, at 46th Street. Starting in April, the company will move its facilities out of the 666 Third Avenue site into the Union Square space. It will continue to occupy the space at 733 Third Avenue.</p>
        <p>''We started in Manhattan in 1969 with 300 square feet and three employees,'' Mr. Zises said of the company's beginning. ''Now we employ 1,500 people in Manhattan and will occupy 700,000 square feet. We are confident of the future of the company, and we are delighted to be staying.'' 'New Yorkers Born and Bred'</p>
        <p>Mr. Zises, who said his company has assets of about $6 billion and manages assets of more than $15 billion for other people and institutions, said, ''Our life insurance company is just across the road in Fort Lee, and it certainly was a viable alternative to New York. But we're New Yorkers born and bred.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the deal could have been concluded without the participation of the city, Mr. Zises said simply, ''Never.''</p>
        <p>David Lowenfeld, the senior vice president of the city's Financial Services Corporation, said that, through its Industrial Development Agency, the city will issue $70.5 million in industrial revenue bonds to provide the permanent financing for the project. Such bonds are not guaranteed by the city, Mr. Lowenfeld said, ''but they make the deal possible because they are exempt from city and state taxes.''</p>
        <p>The bonds help to finance the project in this way: A developer takes out a loan to finance construction of a project. When the building is complete, he seeks a second loan to pay off the construction costs, and the second loan becomes the basis for his mortgage payments. The issuance of the bonds by the city agency makes it possible for the developer to obtain the second loan at a lower interest rate because they are tax exempt.</p>
        <p>The second part of the city's participation in the project, Mr. Lowenfeld said, falls under an industrial and commercial incentive program. ''The city is providing real-estate tax abatement to the office space at Zeckendorf Towers under the incentive program,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>''That means that the project has to pay less taxes in its early years of operation,'' he said. ''Deferred taxes means lower costs to Integrated and that means jobs for the city of New York. Their decision to stay and grow means jobs for the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>The president of the Zeckendorf Company, William Zeckendorf Jr., said: ''The city made this deal possible. This is what they have to do with groups that can easily move out of the city.''</p>
