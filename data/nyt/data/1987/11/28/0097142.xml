        <p>LEAD: A re-evaluation of the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has begun here with the endorsement of the Communist authorities, despite Nietzsche's reputation as one of the principal spiritual fathers of Nazism.</p>
        <p>A re-evaluation of the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has begun here with the endorsement of the Communist authorities, despite Nietzsche's reputation as one of the principal spiritual fathers of Nazism.</p>
        <p>The re-evaluation and a search for positive elements in Nietzsche's grim and cruel view of mankind began last year in an essay by Heinz Pepperle in East Germany's leading cultural publication, Sinn und Form, titled ''Revision of the Marxist View of Nietzsche.'' It followed a Nietzsche renaissance in Western Europe over the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pepperle might have been able to continuing hoeing his academic row quietly were it not for a trenchant attack on his ideas published by Sinn und Form this fall. In a brilliant polemic, Wolfgang Harich, a philosopher who is considered one of East Gemany's most original thinkers, sought to tear the Pepperle defense of Nietzsche to pieces.</p>
        <p>With copious citations, Mr. Harich establishes that in his writings Nietzsche was generally anti-humanist and specifically anti-Semitic, racially bigoted and profoundly prejudiced against women. 'The Whip' for Women</p>
        <p>Mr. Harich notes that Nietzsche wrote, ''If you go to women, don't forget the whip,'' and that in ''Thus Spake Zarathustra,'' the philosopher declared that women should be regarded as ''property'' and as a gender ''incapable of deep thought.''</p>
        <p>Rejecting Dr. Pepperle's assertion that ''Nietzsche was no anti-Semite,'' Mr. Harich cites many passages in which he mocked or vilified Jews, such as, ''All Jews become saccharine when they moralize.'' He also cites Nietzsche's statements that Jews were ''the true rulers of the European press.''</p>
        <p>''For my generation, that already begins to smell of zyklon B,'' Mr. Harich concludes, referring to the gas used in the Nazi extermination camps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harich, who is 64 years old, goes on to remark on Nietzsche's contempt for American Indians and for the Chinese, who he wrote should be kept as slaves because they resemble ''diligent ants.'' He quotes Nietzsche on the subject of the ''warrior mentality'' and the need for war. ''Perhaps mankind will be eliminated,'' Nietzsche wrote. ''Let it be!'' Hitler's Admiration Cited Finally Mr. Harich notes that Hitler incorporated whole passages of Nietzsche's into his own ''Mein Kampf,'' the bible of the Nazi movement, and that Hitler paid frequent calls at the Nietzsche archive in Weimar before and after he came to power in 1933.</p>
        <p>On one occasion, Nietzsche's sister, Elisabeth Forster Nietzsche, presented Hitler with her brother's walking stick. He notes also the Nazi use of such Nietzschean coinages as ''the blond beast,'' ''superman'' and ''masters of the earth'' to underpin Hitler's ideology of a German master race.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Harich left his critique at that, calm might have reigned on the Nietzsche frontier. But at the conclusion of his 35-page essay he makes a philosophical leap and declares that the East German Nietzsche revival is part of a ''homemade'' fashion of taking up with ''problematical figures of German history such as Luther, Frederick II and Bismarck more generously than earlier.''</p>
        <p>Nietzsche was born in 1844 in the Saxony village of Rokken and was buried there, in what is now the heart of East Germany, in 1900. Mr. Harich suggests that if he had been born elsewhere in Germany, the current interest of the East German authorities would have been far less.</p>
        <p>Here Mr. Harich struck a raw nerve, because for the last 10 years, under the leadership of Erich Honecker, the East German authorities have worked assiduously to re-define German history and its relevance to the country's Communist society.</p>
        <p>This has brought a celebration of Martin Luther, the placement of a bronze statue of Frederick the Great on Unter den Linden, and the publication of a major biography of Otto von Bismarck. All of these constituted major re-evaluations, in some cases rehabilitations of German historical figures in the German Communist pantheon. Attack at Writers' Congress</p>
        <p>So it was no big surprise at this week's 10th congress of the East German Writers Association that Mr. Harich's polemic came under heavy attack.</p>
        <p>''Fire and brimstone,'' Hermann Kant, chairman of the writers' group, declared in his opening speech. ''That's what this contribution to Sinn und Form tastes of to me, whose author wants to protect us from Nietzsche but uses the occasion to place in question cultural positions that took a long time to achieve.''</p>
        <p>A poet, Stefan Hermlin, calling Nietzsche ''a difficult, tragic figure,'' accused Mr. Harich of ''reactionary retrogression'' in the manner of ''ignoramuses and ideological berserkers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harich, Mr. Hermlin said, seemed ''unable to grasp that a society striving toward the future must assure its past.''</p>
        <p>With that the green light for East Germany's Nietzsche renaissance was turned on.</p>
