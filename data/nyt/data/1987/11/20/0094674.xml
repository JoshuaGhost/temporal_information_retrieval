        <p>LEAD: The most accurate kickers in National Football League history are playing right now. And two of them are performing for New York teams.</p>
        <p>The most accurate kickers in National Football League history are playing right now. And two of them are performing for New York teams.</p>
        <p>Kickers are expected to perform at such a high level these days that Raul Allegre's record-equaling show last Sunday, when he became only the 13th player in league history to kick two 50-yard field goals, prompted this response from Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants:</p>
        <p>''Field-goal kickers who make only 50 percent of their kicks don't hang around too long,''</p>
        <p>Allegre's 52-yard field goal provided the margin of victory and he had made a 53-yarder earlier, but he also missed from 47 and 41 yards -leaving him at 50 percent for the day.</p>
        <p>The place-kicking revolution is being led by the Saints' Morten Andersen, who will bring his career average of .797 into the Superdome against the Giants on Sunday in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>''He's the best guy in the league,'' Parcells said. ''It ain't even close for second.'' Not Bad Himself</p>
        <p>But Allegre is one of history's best himself, with a .721 average. He does not qualify for the league's career record list, though, because he has not kicked the minimum 100 field goals.</p>
        <p>Allegre, like many of the top kickers, is foreign-born.</p>
        <p>''In the late 60's and early 70's the soccer-style kickers came in from other countries, and that's when we got the bad rap,'' said the Mexican-born Allegre, referring to the belief that kickers then knew nothing about football. ''But now all the foreign-born players have studied the position.''</p>
        <p>They easily have displaced any myth that the old days were better, at least for kickers.</p>
        <p>People like to believe there was something fishy, for example, about the famed 1958 playoff game between the Giants and the Colts, when the Colts went for the touchdown in sudden-death overtime on third down instead of a ''sure'' field goal from about the 16. On Shaky Feet</p>
        <p>But the Colts' field-goal kicker was Steve Myhra - and he had made only 4 of 10 attempts during the season. Coach Weeb Ewbank of the Colts had so little regard for him that he used Myhra an average of less than once a game.</p>
        <p>The great Lou Groza of the Browns had a career average of only .548. George Blanda's average was under 50 percent for the first 10 years of his 26 seasons, and he finished at .525. Pat Summerall was a 48 percent kicker until he joined the Giants.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Jets' Pat Leahy is 10th on the career list at .693, and he is getting better.</p>
        <p>''A big thing about the players in the old days - they used to play another position as well,'' Leahy said. ''By the time they had to kick, they probably were tired. Also, it didn't help them having the posts on the goal line. The posts probably blocked more shots than having the posts back where they are now.'' Better Working Conditions</p>
        <p>The current group also has some constants going for them: for the most part, they kick on artificial turf and benefit from increased attention to the snapper and holder.</p>
        <p>''In my case, artificial turf has made a big difference,'' Leahy said. He is better than ever since the Jets left windy, grassy Shea Stadium for the carpet of Giants Stadium in 1984. Before the move, he was 141-215 (.656) on field goals, and is 71-91 (.780) since.</p>
        <p>The 36-year-old Leahy is on one of the great field-goal streaks: He has made 40 of his last 45 kicks - including 32 straight from inside the 40.</p>
        <p>His two unsuccessful kicks this season - in 14 attempts - came on a last-second 62-yard attempt into the wind and a 49-yarder last Sunday at Kansas City. Leahy then made his next three.</p>
        <p>''Look at the list of kickers,'' said Leahy of the league leaders. ''Two of the four kick in a dome.'' Andersen is in the Superdome, and Eddie Murray of Detroit - one of the least-known kickers to the public and the fifth all-time kicker at .725 - works in the Silverdome.</p>
        <p>Six of the top 10 play their home games on artificial surfaces, which usually guarantee a good placement by the holder and a good stride by the kicker.</p>
        <p>There are only two retired kickers among history's top 10: Rafael Septien, who played most of his career with Dallas and is seventh, and Rolf Benirschke of San Diego, eighth. The ninth-ranked kicker, Cleveland's Matt Bahr, is on injured reserve.</p>
        <p>Kickers who don't qualify but should make the list soon include Allegre at .721 (88-122), and the Rams' Mike Lansford at .740 (91-123). In addition, two other top kickers who have kicked the minimum 100 field goals are Tony Franklin of the Patriots with a career mark of .691 and Jim Breech of the Bengals at .685.</p>
        <p>Of course, not every kicker is a star from the beginning. Leahy failed in a tryout with the Cardinals before the Jets signed him, and Allegre was cut by the Colts in camp in 1986 after three seasons with them.</p>
        <p>And the N.F.L.'s No. 2 kicker, Gary Anderson of the Steelers, is successful on 77 percent of his kicks. But the Bills cut him before the 1982 season. The Steelers immediately picked him up. He entered this season as the top-rated kicker before being passed by Andersen, but also has the longest active extra-point streak at 164 straight. The Bills? They are on their third kicker since Anderson left.</p>
        <p>But Leahy, true to the kicker's code, empathizes with Scott Norwood, the Bills' present place-kicker.</p>
        <p>''In Buffalo, you've got the weather to worry about,'' Leahy said. But the only things bothering Leahy lately are 62-yarders.</p>
