        <p>LEAD: St. John's University survived a scare today to win the 13th annual Joe Lapchick Memorial tournament at Alumni Hall in Jamaica, Queens. The Redmen, who have never lost a game in the history of the tournament, held off a late rally by Loyola Marymount University to win, 88-85.</p>
        <p>St. John's University survived a scare today to win the 13th annual Joe Lapchick Memorial tournament at Alumni Hall in Jamaica, Queens. The Redmen, who have never lost a game in the history of the tournament, held off a late rally by Loyola Marymount University to win, 88-85.</p>
        <p>Loyola (1-1) overcame an 11-point second-half deficit to close to within 85-84, on a 15-foot jump shot by Jeff Fryer with 37 seconds left. Michael Porter of St. John's was then fouled with 15 seconds to go. Porter, who was named to the all-tournament team, made the first foul shot but missed the second. He stole Hank Gathers's outlet pass, however, and drove for a layup to make it 88-84.</p>
        <p>The Lions had one last chance to tie when Matt Brust was given the Redmen's fourth technical of the game, his third, for reaching over the end line on the inbound play. Mike Yoest, who finished with 22 points, hit the free throw, but an open 3-point attempt by Fryer with 3 seconds left fell short, sealing the victory for St. John's.</p>
        <p>''I just got a little overenthusiastic,'' Brust said about his third technical. ''I took a swipe at the ball, and it's just something I have to swallow.'' Brust was also given technicals for delay of game and grabbing the rim. Looking to Lead</p>
        <p>The game featured an exceptional matchup at power forward, where Shelton Jones of St. John's, the tournament's most valuable player, and Gathers of Loyola, who was on the all-tournament team, went head to head. Jones led both teams with 25 points and 16 rebounds; Gathers, a transfer from Southern Cal, had 24 and 10.</p>
        <p>''Today, we needed some rebounding and a little bit of scoring, and that's what I gave us,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-9-inch senior explained that last year he was more of a role player, and that Mark Jackson, now of the Knicks, was the team leader. ''Now that Mark's not here, I'm looking to be a leader,'' Jones said. ''I'm more confident than last year and I know I can score.''</p>
        <p>The Redmen were able to keep Loyola's high-powered fast break in check by controlling the boards; they had 42 rebounds to Loyola's 33. ''We didn't want to play their tempo,'' Coach Lou Carnesecca said. ''We can run, but you don't give them their strength.''</p>
        <p>However, St. John's couldn't seem to pull away from the pesky Lions. After leading by as many as 9 in the first half, the Redmen went into the locker room leading, 44-40. In the second half, St. John's led, 60-49, with just over 13 minutes left, but Loyola went on a 14-6 run to close to 66-63 with 7:30 to go.</p>
        <p>The Redmen opened a 10-point lead with 4:30 left, 77-67, before the Lions made the final rally that came up short.</p>
        <p>Greg (Boo) Harvey, an all-tournament selection at guard, added 18 points for St. John's (2-0). Corey Gaines, Loyola's other all-tournament selection, had 20 points and 5 assists.</p>
        <p>In the consolation game, a junior guard, Mike Gielen, scored 14 points and handed out 10 assists to lead Harvard (1-1) to a 87-83 victory over Tennessee Tech. Earl Wise of Tennessee Tech, an all-tournament selection, led all scorers with 25 points. The Golden Eagles dropped to 0-2.  Michigan 78 Ala.-Birmingham 76</p>
        <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -Gary Grant sank three free throws in the final 35 seconds as Michigan edged Alabama-Birmingham for third place in the 10th Great Alaska Shootout tournament.</p>
        <p>Michigan, coming off a 79-64 loss to Arizona on Saturday, squandered a 13-point first-half lead and trailed Alabama-Birmingham by 5 points with 4:20 to go. Two 3-pointers by Glen Rice got the deficit to a point, setting the stage for Grant's free throws. Alabama-Birmingham had the ball and a 76-75 lead with 53 seconds left, but Reginald Turner was called for palming the ball. Grant missed a shot as he drove the lane, and was fouled after grabbing the rebound and attempting another shot.</p>
        <p>Trailing, 77-76, Alabama-Birmingham played for the last shot, but Larry Rembert's 8-foot jumper hit the front of the rim.  Illinois 81, Kansas 75</p>
        <p>LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) - Ken Battle scored 21 points and hit two key second-half baskets to thwart a Kansas comeback as Illinois upset the Jayhawks, 81-75, to finish third in the Maui Classic tournament.</p>
        <p>Battle's clutch shooting and Illinois' balance offset a 28-point peformance by Danny Manning of Kansas, and sent the Jayhawks to their second loss in three games.</p>
        <p>Kansas lost to Iowa, 100-81, on Saturday.</p>
