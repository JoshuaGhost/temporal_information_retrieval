        <p>LEAD: H. Joachim Maitre, the newly appointed dean of the Boston University College of Communication, is not the sort of person to allow the academic life to tie him to a desk or imprison him in detached scholarship.</p>
        <p>H. Joachim Maitre, the newly appointed dean of the Boston University College of Communication, is not the sort of person to allow the academic life to tie him to a desk or imprison him in detached scholarship.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maitre, who in 1953 escaped from East Berlin to West Berlin in an armored personnel carrier, has made a documentary film supporting the rebels in Nicaragua. He has debated a Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier this year he went to Angola to meet Jonas Savimbi, the head of the anti-Communist insurgency in that country.</p>
        <p>Among questions considered these days at Boston University is whether such conspicuous partisanship is a good thing for the head of a school that presumably upholds a tradition of journalistic independence and neutrality.</p>
        <p>Those who say it is not are generally among the critics of Dr. Maitre's most controversial activity. He directs a university project, financed by the United States Information Agency, to teach journalism skills to Afghan refugees in Pakistan so that they can report on the war in Afghanistan. #B.U. President Backs Project# Dr. Maitre, who was named dean in September after holding the job on an interim basis for a year, promotes the project, saying it defends the principle of the free press by breaking a Soviet monopoly on information coming from Afghanistan. He has the support of the university president, John R. Silber. But others at B.U., while not condoning the Soviet takeover, condemn the venture as making the university a collaborator with the American Government in pursuit of a foreign policy goal.</p>
        <p>Questions have also been raised outside the university. ''I stayed away from it with an 11-foot pole,'' Osborn Elliott, the dean of the Columbia University Journalism School, said of the U.S.I.A. project. ''It struck me as verging on the propagandistic rather than the journalistic.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Silber defended the program in a telephone interview, calling the project neither journalism nor propaganda but a legitimate educational effort.</p>
        <p>The unwillingness of any other journalism school to apply for the funds, Dr. Silber said, ''demonstrates the extent to which many universities and schools of journalism in this country feel intimidated to be caught defending free access to information.'' #Dispute Began 2 Years Ago# The issue emerged two years ago when the U.S.I.A. invited proposals for a $500,000 grant to carry out the Afghan project, which was authorized by Congress in 1985.</p>
        <p>When Boston University's College of Communication, which contains the journalism school and separate schools of broadcasting and public relations, submitted a proposal, there was no sign that anybody objected to the principle of using government money to train the Afghan students.</p>
        <p>But a snag developed when the U.S.I.A., citing limited funds, required that the training be carried out in Pakistan rather than on an American campus. Bernard S. Redmont, who was then dean, and a group of 10 journalism faculty members argued that the new condition was unacceptable, given the ''turmoil of a refugee center'' and the difficulty of exercising academic control at such a distance.</p>
        <p>Dr. Silber and Dr. Maitre, who was to be director of the project, wanted to push ahead, and a new proposal was submitted in behalf of the university. But the issue, by all accounts, was more than an intellectual debate&gt; a sort of mutual suspicion emerges in conversations with both sides.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the project saw it as part of an attempt by conservatives like Dr. Maitre to press personal political causes, while advocates charactarized its opponents as leftists complacent about the Soviet threat and unwilling to give conservative positions a fair hearing. #Maitre a 'True Believer'# ''Maitre is emblematic,'' one faculty member said, ''because he does have strong views and he is active in stating them. The big question is whether the guy, as a true believer, is capable of perpetuating diversity and fairness in tolerating views that are not his own.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Silber, who has played a key role in setting the institution's political tone, contends that Dr. Maitre has done nothing to stifle debate at the university and is criticized in large part because he openly supports some conservative causes. ''It is very strange,'' he said, ''that nobody in the academic community says a word against activism as long as it is repressive activism from the left.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Maitre, a former correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt, joined the Boston University faculty in 1983. Dr. Silber named him interim dean of the College of Communication last year when Mr. Redmont, his major rival on the Afghan project, stepped down after a series of quarrels with members of his staff. #Old 'Red' Charges Resurface# The resignation of Mr. Redmont, who had dismissed an associate dean, Ronald S. Goldman, apparently over disagreements on the Afghan project, followed a mysterious aspect of the affair, the circulation of 35-year-old allegations that Mr. Redmont had Communist sympathies.</p>
        <p>The allegations appeared in the student newspaper last year after Mr. Goldman, who has since been reinstated, and another associate dean did library research on Mr. Redmont's past, but the two men deny giving the information to the paper.</p>
        <p>An article headlined ''The Secret of Redmont's Red Past?'' reported that in 1945, a former Communist spy had told Federal investigators that Mr. Redmont was an ''underground Communist'' who had given ''considerable information'' to the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>There seems to have been no substantiation of that charge, and Mr. Redmont was never formally charged with being a Communist. In a letter to the newspaper, he called the article ''an extensive re-hash of inaccurate and ancient accusations against me.'' #Teaching Is Largely Over# In some respects, all this debate has been outstripped by events. The teaching phase of the project has largely been completed and Dr. Maitre left for Pakistan in late September to embark on the next step&gt; creating an Afghan Media Resources Center in Pakistan where the participants' reports will be collected.</p>
        <p>But the new dean is still surrounded by controversy.</p>
        <p>In September the student newspaper reported a link between Dr. Maitre's trips to Central America and organizations connected to the Iran-contra affair, but the dean said he did only scholarly work for the groups.</p>
        <p>Dr. Maitre ''seems to be on the outskirts of all kinds of conflicts around the world,'' James Iffland, who teaches Spanish at B.U., told the student newspaper earlier this year. ''Is this the sort of thing you want a dean of the school involved in?''</p>
        <p>But James Thistle, the director of the journalism program, who notes that Dr. Maitre appointed him despite his own early opposition to the Afghan project, contends that the dean's personal views do not influence the way he runs the College of Communication. ''We are not given some kind of ideological line to teach in the classroom around here,'' said Mr. Thistle. ''It just doesn't happen like that.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Maitre, acknowledging the controversy that surrounds him, said&gt; ''They say I'm a rabble-rousing anti-Communist, which I am not.</p>
        <p>''It's true I'm not very friendly toward Communist governments, but I draw the line between my view of Communist government and my influence on students.''</p>
