        <p>LEAD: Jane Weinberger today confirmed reports that her husband, Caspar W. Weinberger would resign as Secretary of Defense later this week, but she said that her health was not the reason.</p>
        <p>Jane Weinberger today confirmed reports that her husband, Caspar W. Weinberger would resign as Secretary of Defense later this week, but she said that her health was not the reason.</p>
        <p>''All the stories you hear about my general health are not true,'' she said in a telephone interview from Monterey, Calif., where she has accompanied her husband.</p>
        <p>However, family friends said that Mrs. Weinberger was just being stoic. She has been undergoing radiation treatments for cancer this summer, they said, and her condition worsened a couple of weeks ago.</p>
        <p>It was this, coupled with fatigue from almost seven years of service, that prompted Mr. Weinberger's decision to resign, they say.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinberger sounded in high spirits today, said she was delighted to be getting her husband back full time. ''I've been talking about it for eight years,'' she added with a chuckle. Addition to Home in Maine</p>
        <p>In preparation for their new life, they have been building an addition to their home on Mount Desert Island in Maine and have moved from their sprawling Washington home into an easy-to-manage Watergate apartment.</p>
        <p>But she does concede that she has been ill.</p>
        <p>''What is causing all the rumors,'' she explained, ''is that I broke two vertebrae in my back and it is extremely painful and I've been walking with a cane.'' She added that she had ''picked up something heavy in the wrong direction several months ago'' and then had reinjured herself. She said she had also undergone a hysterectomy for cancer of the uterus, followed by six weeks of radiation that ended in February. She has also been troubled with a torn knee cartilage for more than a year. ''After 60 you begin to patch up a bit,'' said Mrs. Weinberger, who is 69 years old.</p>
        <p>She has been busy all summer with the Maine house, she said. ''We're putting in a library so his books can be stashed up there,'' she said. ''And we bought two Watergate apartments which we put together because he'll be doing some writing in Washington -all his papers will be at the Library of Congress.''</p>
        <p>In Mount Desert, Mr. Weinberger is better known as a jack-of-all-trades rather than as a dignified member of the Reagan Cabinet. He can often be found lending his wife a hand in her publishing business, Windswept House, a tiny company that operates out of an office over the Weinberger garage. Where Mundane Is a Joy</p>
        <p>''Cap thinks its great fun,'' Mrs. Weinberger said in another interview two years ago, ''He'll pack books, sell books, make telephone calls - he's even been known to deliver them.''</p>
        <p>Although the couple spent many years in California, they have always contemplated retirement to their home in Maine, her native state. Theirs is a place, she said, ''where you can close the gate and live close to the water.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinberger has served in his post longer than any Defense Secretary but Robert S. McNamara, and some here felt he was set on matching or beating Mr. McNamara's record of just over seven years.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinberger termed this hogwash, saying her husband has no interest in setting longevity records. ''He stayed on while he thought he could be helpful,'' she said. ''He has thought of leaving several times but the timing never seem quite right before.''</p>
        <p>Since the founding of her publishing house in 1984, she has spent May through October in Maine, making quick trips to Washington for special events. Mr. Weinberger would often head for Mount Desert on weekends .</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinberger has written a number of the 31 books, many of them for children, that have been published by her company. One of their publishing ventures was ''Kiltie,'' a book written by Mrs. Weinberger about their pet collie, with photos ''by Cap.'' First Met on Troop Transport</p>
        <p>The Weinbergers, parents of two and grandparents of two, first met on board a troop transport bound for Australia in the 1940's. When the ship docked three weeks later, the young Army nurse and the young second lieutenant, who had met over a chess game, went out and got married.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinberger, a woman with a wry humor, has eschewed much of the Washington social scene, the art openings, the embassy receptions, the Kennedy Center parties at which her husband is often glimpsed. But she has been an indefatigable fund-raiser for some of her favorite Washington institutions, including the Folger Shakespeare Library and the National Capital Children's Museum.</p>
        <p>''She really put the Folger on the map in terms of the social world,'' said Michael Valentine, director of development for the Folger.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinberger started doing volunteer work at the Folger back in 1970, when her husband first came to Washington to serve as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration. She later became a member of the Amherst College board of trustees and assumed the chairmanship of the Folger Library Committee for eight years.</p>
        <p>For the Folger's 50th anniversary celebration, she was able to arrange a White House reception and insure President and Mrs. Reagan's attendance at the white-tie Folger gala that followed.</p>
        <p>Once back in Maine on a more or less full-time basis, she said, she hopes to put her husband on the publishing payroll ''if he is not too busy.''</p>
        <p>Will Windswept House publish the Secretary's projected book?</p>
        <p>''I doubt it,'' she drily replied. ''He has had other offers.''</p>
