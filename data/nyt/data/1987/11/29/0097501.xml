        <p>LEAD: IN COMMEMORATION of the 50th anniversary of the composer's death, the Paper Mill Playhouse is having its own George Gershwin celebration, presenting the breezy pastiche ''My One and Only.''</p>
        <p>IN COMMEMORATION of the 50th anniversary of the composer's death, the Paper Mill Playhouse is having its own George Gershwin celebration, presenting the breezy pastiche ''My One and Only.''</p>
        <p>This is a musical that started out to be a remake of ''Funny Face'' (1927). Along the way, it got itself a new, giddy book by Peter Stone and Timothy S. Mayer, and gathered from assorted George and Ira Gershwin stage and screen scores a grab-bag of divine songs, from the daft and delightful ''I Can't Be Bothered Now'' and ''Blah, Blah, Blah'' to the evergreen ''Soon'' and '' 'S Wonderful.''</p>
        <p>What is not so wonderful about the Paper Mill production is its aura of artificiality. It emerges more as patchwork than pastiche.</p>
        <p>The romance between the celebrated English Channel swimmer Edith Herbert (she's looking for a ''snappy dresser'') and ace flyer Capt. Billy Buck Chandler (he's smitten the moment he sees her) is captivatingly silly and fanciful, but it's got to be played for real and as if for keeps.</p>
        <p>''It's about meeting a girl'' is how Billy sums it up, as he is whisked off to the exotic underground Club Havana in pursuit of Edith, who is being kept and blackmailed by the bogus Prince Nicolai Erraclyovitch Tchatchavadze.</p>
        <p>''Nikki'' is withholding her passport, and also holding compromising photos of Edith that were taken when she was 17. Edith flies off with Billy (to Staten Island), and he also follows her to Morocco. There is also mention of a side trip to Perth Amboy.</p>
        <p>Recently, at a professional dinner-theater in Westchester, Paper Mill's Billy (George Dvorsky) and Edith (Donna Kane) had a big success in the roles that Tommy Tune and Twiggy originated on Broadway in 1983. That production was directed by Richard Casper, with choreography by Patti D'Beck, both of whom are making their Paper Mill debuts.</p>
        <p>But the reunion is not a grand one. What seemed spontaneous and seamless in an intimate setting, with the audience seated on three sides of the small Westchester stage, does not appear so effortless in a huge proscenium theater, and the two leading players lack the size and spark to fill it and set the show off.</p>
        <p>Here, Mr. Casper's staging has seams to spare, and a flighty fable is reduced to a romance by rote.</p>
        <p>By now, Ms. Kane's wide-eyed posturing and arched stance have become arch indeed, remnants of her acclaimed performance in an Off Broadway revival of ''Dames at Sea.'' Here, more mind should be paid to the phrasing, as opposed to just the sheer sound, of such inimitable songs as ''How Long Has This Been Going On?''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Dvorsky, he now seems to be suffering from slackness in the dance department.</p>
        <p>At the Paper Mill, where the show runs through Dec. 13, the all-out production numbers work best, especially ''Kickin' the Clouds Away,'' which is performed with zest by Roumel Reaux and a nifty ensemble.</p>
        <p>And there can be no carping when it comes to those marvelous Gershwin tunes and lyrics.</p>
        <p>In this ''new Gershwin musical,'' as it was billed on Broadway, one hears such newly inspired musical moments as the positioning of the songs ''Soon'' and ''Boy Wanted'' in counterpoint, as well as witty references to Gershwin's classical compositions in the here-uncredited orchestrations.</p>
        <p>Still, the fairy tale about the aviator and the aquatic star neither flies, nor comes off swimmingly, in this staging.</p>
