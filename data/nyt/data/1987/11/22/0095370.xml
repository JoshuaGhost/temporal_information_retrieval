        <p>LEAD: In 1913, as a cocoa boom began to transform this West African island, a Spanish planter erected La Barcelonesa, a mansion with curving balustrades and verandahs cooled by sea breezes.</p>
        <p>In 1913, as a cocoa boom began to transform this West African island, a Spanish planter erected La Barcelonesa, a mansion with curving balustrades and verandahs cooled by sea breezes.</p>
        <p>With time and care, the surrounding 2,000 acres of rich volcanic soil produced 320 tons of cocoa a year.</p>
        <p>Today, the plantation is abandoned. Subsistence farmers gather eight tons of cocoa a year from untended trees.</p>
        <p>La Barcelonesa still stands on a promontory here. But jungle vegetation climbs over the verandahs, obscuring the views of the Atlantic. The mansion is shuttered, waiting for owners who will never return.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, an aging caretaker emerged from an outbuilding to find foreign visitors walking amid the rusting farm machinery. Asked about the past, the old man's eyes lighted up. ''In the old days, we had many workers,'' he said. ''Now it is 'abandonado.' ''</p>
        <p>As much of the African continent nears the end of a third decade of independence, African nations can be divided into two groups.</p>
        <p>The first includes Cameroon, Gabon, the Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Zimbabwe - countries that have better roads, telephone systems, health care, nutrition and per capita incomes than they did at independence.</p>
        <p>In the second group, one finds Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, Mozambique, Uganda and Zaire. In these countries, poorly managed transitions to independence caused the collapse of colonial public installations and services. The Loss of Skilled Colonials</p>
        <p>War or political chaos provoked the abrupt departure of skilled whites. Under colonialism, not enough Africans were trained to fill the void. And, in the post-independence upheavals, many skilled Africans also left for the old colonial metropolises - London, Paris, Brussels, Madrid or Lisbon.</p>
        <p>Once things fell apart, they proved difficult to put back together again.</p>
        <p>Flying over this island, one sees a thick forest dotted with the rusting roofs of Spanish fincas - plantations with mansions and cocoa-drying sheds.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in northern Angola, peasant squatters have moved into houses abandoned by Portuguese coffee planters. The coffee bushes have been cut down for subsistence farm plots. Angola's coffee industry fell apart in the mid-1970's, when virtually all the coffee agronomists fled civil war and the Marxist Government for Brazil.</p>
        <p>In Guinea, banana and pineapple plantations met the same fate after de Gaulle ordered out French citizens at independence in 1958.</p>
        <p>In Zaire's Shaba Province, plantations abandoned by Belgian families under a nationalization program in the early 1970's have fallen into a similar, haunting state of decay. Back to Subsistence Farming</p>
        <p>In Equatorial Guinea, the reversion to subsistence farming is most striking.</p>
        <p>At independence in 1968, production of cocoa - the major export - was 40,000 tons. Last year, it was 6,500.</p>
        <p>Shortly after independence, the 7,000 Spaniards here left. Over the next decade, the President, Nguema Biyoto Masie, killed or forced into exile a third of the African population, including most of the educated elite.</p>
        <p>''We inherited a completely destroyed nation,'' Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the present President, said in a recent interview. Mr. Obiang assumed power in a coup in 1979.</p>
        <p>As in many African countries, he could not repair ruptures caused in the first years of independence.</p>
        <p>For example, to prevent citizens form escaping this island, the first President ordered the burning of all fishing boats. The craft of fishing and of making fishing boats was not passed on to the next generation. Today, local fishing has not recovered.</p>
        <p>Under the Spanish, malaria was eradicated from major towns. Today, malaria is a major health hazard.</p>
        <p>Insecurity for foreign investors has hindered a revival of cocoa cultivation. ''Anyone who comes in with some money to invest will find some minister demanding to be put on the board of directors,'' an aid worker said.</p>
