        <p>LEAD: President Seyni Kountche of the West African country of Niger died of a brain tumor in a Paris hospital today after 13 years in office.</p>
        <p>President Seyni Kountche of the West African country of Niger died of a brain tumor in a Paris hospital today after 13 years in office.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old President was flown to Paris on Saturday for his sixth hospital visit since suffering a mild heart attack last December.</p>
        <p>A few hours before the President's death, the Niger radio announced that Col. Ali Seybou had been named acting head of state because of Mr. Kountche's ''very worrying'' state of health. Colonel Seybou, Chief of Staff of the army, was a cousin of the former President.</p>
        <p>With the death of Mr. Kountche, the United States and France lose a quiet ally in Chad's war against Libya. Niger, a largely desert nation of about six million people, shares a 250-mile border with Libya. Mr. Kountche, who served for 12 years in the French colonial army, was suspicious of Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Relations at a Low Level</p>
        <p>Since taking power in a coup in 1974, the conservative Niger leader kept relations with his northern neighbor at a low level. Mr. Kountche was said to resent Libyan broadcasts to Niger in local languages, and he accused Libya of training Tuareg groups to destablilize his Government. The Tuaregs are a nomadic, fiercely independent Berber group.</p>
        <p>Last December, it was reported that France secretly used Niger's military airfield at Dirkou to parachute arms and supplies to Chadian Government forces in the Tibesti Mountains of Chad. The airfield was renovated by American engineers in 1984.</p>
        <p>Today, President Francois Mitterrand said he regretted the loss of ''one of the most loyal friends of France.'' Last weekend, the African leader was flown to Paris in a plane provided by the French President.</p>
        <p>During his tenure, Mr. Kountche weathered three coup attempts, and Niger's new leader is expected to face challenges to his power.</p>
        <p>The country he inherits is one of the poorest in the world. According to the World Bank, the per capita income is $200 a year, the 10th lowest recorded. Twice Ravaged by Drought</p>
        <p>Twice in the last 20 years, the thinly populated nation almost twice the size of Texas has been ravaged by drought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kountche took power at the height of the 1969-1974 drought, promising to end corruption in the distribution of food aid. But during the next drought, in 1983, a group of young officers, charging that corruption and nepotism was rife in government, took part in an unsuccessful coup In recent years, the United States has been the main food donor to Niger. President Kountche visited Washington in 1984 and Vice President Bush visited Niamey, the capital, in 1985.</p>
        <p>The major source of recent growth in Niger has been uranium, the nation's largest export. In 1971, Niger's uranium mines in the Air mountains went into production under the management of Somair, a uranium mining company controlled by the French Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
        <p>In the oil crisis of the 1970's, uranium prices rose and Niger enjoyed a small boom. Since then, uranium prices have fallen sharply and Niger has had to reschedule its debt payments.</p>
