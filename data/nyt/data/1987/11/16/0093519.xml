        <p>LEAD: Solemn memorial services replaced demonstrations as the focus of attention here today as Northern Ireland marked the anniversary of a landmark treaty signed two years ago by Britain and Ireland in an effort to bring peace to this troubled province.</p>
        <p>Solemn memorial services replaced demonstrations as the focus of attention here today as Northern Ireland marked the anniversary of a landmark treaty signed two years ago by Britain and Ireland in an effort to bring peace to this troubled province.</p>
        <p>On this date last year, Protestant demonstrators looted 30 stores and wounded 27 people to show their furious opposition to the agreement, which gives Ireland a consultative voice in the affairs of this British province.</p>
        <p>This second anniversary of the treaty was expected to bring another weekend of tension and possible violence. But the killing of 11 Protestants in Enniskillen last Sunday by a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army changed the public mood here.</p>
        <p>In a shocked response, Protestant and Roman Catholics churches held memorial services all over Ireland today, with both denominations represented at large ecumenical services here and in Dublin. In a pastoral letter, Catholic bishops today told their communicants that it was a sin to support the I.R.A., whose membership is Catholic.</p>
        <p>But most analysts agreed that the memorial services represented only a brief hiatus in the violence and the continuing debate over the treaty, which is generally known here as the Anglo-Irish agreement. Strife Claims 2,622 Lives</p>
        <p>The treaty was intended to curb the sectarian violence between Protestants and Catholics that has claimed 2,622 lives since 1969. It was also intended to foster negotiations to move Northern Ireland toward the resumption of some form of self-government for the first time since 1974. Neither goal has been accomplished, and in the week since the tragedy at Enniskillen, both opponents and supporters of the British-Irish treaty have been citing the bombing to bolster their opposing views.</p>
        <p>The Thatcher Government remains strongly committed to the agreement. But the Unionist political parties that represent most of the Protestant majority oppose it as an edict imposed without consultation. They view the advisory role granted to Ireland as a first dangerous step toward a united Ireland in which Protestants would be outnumbered by four to one.</p>
        <p>As the agreement enters its third year, most officials believe that so far the London and Dublin Governments have gained more from it than has the province itself. For Mrs. Thatcher, it was a way to win credit in the United States for tackling an intractable problem. Her Government also gained security cooperation from Dublin that makes it harder for the I.R.A. to use Ireland as a haven.</p>
        <p>In that regard, the Enniskillen bombing may come to be regarded as an event that firmed Ireland's commitment to the agreement. Extradition Act at Issue</p>
        <p>Dublin's resolve had been in some doubt since the election in March of Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, who had opposed the signing of the agreement in 1985 by his predecessor, Garret FitzGerald.</p>
        <p>Before Enniskillen, Mr. Haughey had been resisting British pressure to complete ratification of Ireland's new Extradition Act, which would ease the delivery of suspected terrorists to British courts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haughey wanted to delay the Dec. 1 effective date of the act until Britain changed the nonjury special courts that try cases of political terrorism here by replacing the single all-powerful judge with a three-judge panel.</p>
        <p>But in response to demands from his own Parliament for action against the I.R.A., Mr. Haughey is set to allow ratification to proceed on schedule despite Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to change the special court system. There are signs that she may make it more palatable for Mr. Haughey by setting up a judicial review commission.</p>
