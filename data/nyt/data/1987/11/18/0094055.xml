        <p>BY modifying eating habits during the holidays and beyond, you can savor many Thanksgivings to come. The following guidelines were suggested by Susan Kinzler, assistant director of patient services in the department of food and nutrition services, Sentara-Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Va., and other hospital dietitians. 1. Exercise portion control. Eat half a slice, not half a pie, and let a little gravy go a long way. Remove as much fat from the gravy as possible. 2. To baste a turkey, use plain broth, apple juice or sherry, not butter or oil. 3. Use herbs freely, but stay the hand that shakes the salt. Avoid canned foods, which tend to be salty. 4. Serve raw vegetables instead of peanuts before a meal, to curb appetites in a nutritional way. 5. Do not add sugar, salt, marshmallows or butter to foods to make a glaze. Use light salad dressings, with a yogurt base, for example. 6. Serve fresh fruit for dessert. If you make cranberry relish from scratch using fresh berries and oranges, you can control the sugar content. 7. Stay away from bacon and sausage, which have a way of sneaking into holiday meals. 8. Make stuffings from whole-grain breads, and flavor them with fruits, fruit juices, herbs and vegetables. Moisten with stock, wine or other nonfat liquid.</p>
