        <p>LEAD: The high cost of nursing home care forces many elderly patients into poverty a few months after they enter the homes, a Congressional survey reported today.</p>
        <p>The high cost of nursing home care forces many elderly patients into poverty a few months after they enter the homes, a Congressional survey reported today.</p>
        <p>Half the couples with one spouse in a nursing home become impoverished within six months and 70 percent of single elderly patients reach the poverty level after only 13 weeks in a nursing home, said the report, issued by the House Select Committee on Aging and made public today.</p>
        <p>''A year in a nursing home wipes out the income of over 90 percent of the elderly living alone,'' said Representative Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, the committee chairman. 'Risk of Impoverishment Is Great'</p>
        <p>The report, developed by the committee in cooperation with the Urban Institute and the Villers Foundation, compared income data from the Census Bureau's 1984 Current Population Survey and nursing home cost data compiled by the Health Care Financing Administration. The financing agency administers the Federal Medicare program for the elderly and disabled and monitors Federal spending in the Federal-state Medicaid program for the poor. The findings were based on income and did not income assets held by the elderly.</p>
        <p>''Especially for the elderly living alone, the risk of long-term-care-induced impoverishment is great and totally unacceptable,'' Mr. Roybal said in a statement accompanying the report.</p>
        <p>''With annual nursing home costs averaging over $22,000 and elderly median annual income being just over $11,500, a host of personal catastrophies are in the making,'' he said. ''Unless concrete action is taken quickly, all lower- and middle-income elderly and non-elderly Americans will remain at great risk of improverishment due to the high and sustained cost of long-term care.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roybal's committee has scheduled a hearing Monday to discuss the findings.</p>
        <p>Catastrophic health legislation that has passed the House and Senate awaits conference committee resolution of numerous differences in the two bills, but neither provides substantial additional long-term care benefits for the nation's 32 million Medicare beneficaries. 'Comes With Heavy Price'</p>
        <p>The report says Medicare, which provides health care insurance for the elderly regardless of income, covers less than 2 percent of long-term nursing home care.</p>
        <p>Medicaid pays about 40 percent of all nursing home care in America, and patients and their families pay 44 percent. But the report says Medicaid coverage ''comes with a heavy price for persons needing long-term care as well as their spouses.''</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that elderly persons must essentially impoverish themselves, and probably their spouses, before they are protected by Medicaid,'' the report says. ''About one-half of the people covered by Medicaid's nursing home benefit became eligible due to impoverishment after entering the nursing home.''</p>
        <p>The report provides detailed comparisons of 22 states, including New York and New Jersey, with large enough nursing home populations to compile sufficient data, based on income alone, on the percentage of people spending themselves into poverty.</p>
        <p>In New York, the report said poverty was reached after 13 weeks for 40 percent of couples with one spouse in a nursing home, after 26 weeks for 55 percent of couples, and after a year for 77 percent. The comparable figures for individuals were 71 percent after 13 weeks in a nursing home, 86 percent after 26 weeks and 95 percent after a year.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the figures for couples were 40 percent after 13 weeks, 59 percent after 26 weeks and 82 percent after a year. For individuals the poverty figures were 69 percent after 13 weeks, 85 percent after 26 weeks and 97 percent after a year.</p>
        <p>Data from all states were used in compiling the national averages.</p>
