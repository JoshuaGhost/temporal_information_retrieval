        <p>LEAD: The Bell &amp; Howell Company said yesterday that it had received an all-cash takeover offer of $602 million, or $64 a share, from a group led by the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several key Bell &amp; Howell executives, including Gerald E. Schultz, the president and chief executive.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The Bell &amp; Howell Company said yesterday that it had received an all-cash takeover offer of $602 million, or $64 a share, from a group led by the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several key Bell &amp; Howell executives, including Gerald E. Schultz, the president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The Bell &amp; Howell Company said yesterday that it had received an all-cash takeover offer of $602 million, or $64 a share, from a group led by the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several key Bell &amp; Howell executives, including Gerald E. Schultz, the president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The offer comes less than a week after Bell &amp; Howell said it was negotiating a management buyout with the Bass group, which is called the BHW Acquisition Corporation. BHW said it expected a response by Dec. 8 from the publishing company, which is based in Skokie, Ill.</p>
        <p>Reaction to the bid among investors and Wall Street analysts was muted, because Macmillan Inc., the publishing company, and Robert Maxwell, the chairman of the British publishing house that bears his name, have also expressed an interest in acquiring the publishing and information services company. Higher Bid Seen</p>
        <p>''This is just the opening salvo,'' said Jan H. Loeb, an analyst at L. F. Rothschild. ''Ultimately, I think it will be sold for more than $70 a share.''</p>
        <p>Investors seemed to agree, as Bell &amp; Howell shares, which jumped above $65 when the Bass talks were announced last week, closed at $67.75 a share, up 25 cents, in sluggish pre-holiday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Macmillan executives did not return telephone calls yesterday. Two days ago, Macmillan said it had asked for Government clearance to raise its 7.7 percent stake in Bell &amp; Howell to more than 50 percent. Maxwell Is Very Interested</p>
        <p>Mr. Maxwell, who has acquired a number of media companies in Britain and is known to be looking for properties in the United States, owns 2.3 percent of Bell &amp; Howell's outstanding shares. He has notified Donald N. Frey, Bell &amp; Howell's outgoing chairman, that we will shortly seek Federal antitrust clearance to buy more than half the company. Mr. Frey, who will retire May 5, 1988, is not a member of the Bass group.</p>
        <p>Robert S. Pirie, president of Rothschild Inc., Mr. Maxwell's investment adviser, was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>In assessing what is likely to turn into a bidding war, analysts said that the Bass group's biggest asset at the moment was its current 16.2 percent stake in the company. But they said that the presence of Bell &amp; Howell management in the BHW group would not necessarily enhance the attractiveness of either the current offer or subsequent offers, even though the company wishes to remain independent and regards the investments by Macmillan and Mr. Maxwell as unsolicited and unwelcomed. Proposals Invited</p>
        <p>Last Thursday Bell &amp; Howell told Salomon Brothers Inc., its investment adviser, to invite proposals from potential suitors. Insiders said last week that they expected Salomon to conduct an ''open auction,'' meaning Bell &amp; Howell would go to the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>''The company's outside board members have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders,'' and would be compelled to accept the highest offer, said George J. Podrasky, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps.</p>
        <p>In spite of Mr. Bass's deep pockets - he inherited more than $1 billion from his uncle, Sid Bass, a Texas wildcatter - Mr. Loeb said the odds seem to favor Mr. Maxwell.</p>
        <p>''In this day and age, Mr. Maxwell is probably willing to spend the most for Bell &amp; Howell,'' he said, ''because he is paying in British pounds and is looking for a base of publishing operations in the United States.''</p>
