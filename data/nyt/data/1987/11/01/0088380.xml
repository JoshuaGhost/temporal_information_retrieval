        <p>LEAD: Speakers at an antismoking conference said Friday that an advertising campaign would target members of the New York City Council who fail to support a bill to restrict smoking in public places.</p>
        <p>Speakers at an antismoking conference said Friday that an advertising campaign would target members of the New York City Council who fail to support a bill to restrict smoking in public places.</p>
        <p>Participants in the daylong conference at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, sponsored by the People for a Smoke Free Indoors, discussed strategies for restricting smoking through state laws and municipal ordinances and focused on efforts in the City Council to pass an antismoking law for New York City.</p>
        <p>In a session called ''Getting the Message Out,'' an advertising consultant, Tony Schwartz, played two radio messages that he said would be broadcast to praise individual members of the council's health committee who vote for the smoking restrictions and to criticize those who fail to support them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz identified health committee members who he said had failed to declare their support for the restrictions and said that the taped messages would be sent to them before the Council vote in an attempt to influence their stand on the bill. 'This Is America'</p>
        <p>One of the health committee members, Morton Povman, Democrat of Queens, said: ''This is America. As long as they don't slander me, it's all right with me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Povman said he would reserve his judgment on the bill until the completion of City Council hearings next week. Denying that he had been subjected to what conference speakers called a ''campaign of lobbying pressure,'' Mr. Povman said, ''I haven't gotten one call from the tobacco industry.''</p>
        <p>Another health committee member, Victor L. Robles, Democrat of Brooklyn, reacted strongly to the planned advertising, saying, ''I refuse to tolerate anyone threatening me with exposure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robles said that he had received letters warning of the advertising campaign but had decided not to answer them. ''I will not take a position until the close of the hearings, until I have heard all the arguments,'' he said. Lobbying Efforts Denounced</p>
        <p>The keynote speaker at the conference, Dr. John C. Duffy, an assistant United States surgeon general, denounced tobacco lobbying efforts aimed at minority groups, which he said emphasized a ''civil rights'' theme.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Dr. Duffy cited an article in the Washington Monthly that criticized ''black leaders in New York City'' who ''rushed to the Tobacco Institute's side'' when the City Council began considering restrictions on smoking.</p>
        <p>Dr. Duffy said that in the black community, the tobacco industry ''thinks it has found an Achilles' heel,'' adding that while smoking was on the decline in the population at large, the industry was focusing its attentions on recruiting new smokers among minority groups.</p>
        <p>''Pick up any magazine devoted to minorities and you will find prominent cigarette advertisement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Duffy and other conference speakers called on black officials to spurn prosmoking lobbying efforts. Discrimination Issue Questioned</p>
        <p>Councilman Hilton B. Clark, Democrat of Manhattan, a black who is also a member of the health committee, described himself as undecided about the antismoking legislation but ridiculed a theme used by some minority group members to oppose smoking restrictions during council hearings.</p>
        <p>''Restricting the use of cigarettes or tobacco doesn't discriminate against minorities at all,'' Mr. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark said that some opponents of the legislation had seized upon a civil rights theme because ''you have to find something to hang your hat on if you are voting for something that is clearly against the public interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark added, however, that he was ''unaware of any evidence of contributions of any kind from the tobacco industry'' to council members who are members of minority groups.</p>
