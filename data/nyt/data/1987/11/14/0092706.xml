        <p>LEAD: In the view of many Republican regulars, Vice President Bush landed an effective verbal punch on Pete du Pont at the first debate of the six candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination in Houston two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>In the view of many Republican regulars, Vice President Bush landed an effective verbal punch on Pete du Pont at the first debate of the six candidates for the Republican Presidential nomination in Houston two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>But Mr. du Pont has been aggressively counterpunching.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, considered by many the front-runner, has been taking jabs from all of his opponents, but the sparring with Mr. du Pont has taken on something of a bare-knuckle quality.</p>
        <p>In Houston, Mr. Bush branded as a ''nutty idea'' and ''dumb'' the proposal by the former Delaware Governor to create an option to the Social Security System. Mr. du Pont contends such an optional retirement system is needed to assure that Social Security remains solvent in the 21st century and to assure benefits to the ''baby boom'' generation now in its 30's and 40's.</p>
        <p>''It's not nutty, it's not dumb, George,'' Mr. du Pont has been declaring in recent days. ''It's a way that young people can save for the future, it's a way that Social Security can be saved and it's one of those ideas that someone running for President ought to be putting forth to meet a real concern around the kitchen table for millions of American families across the country.'' Bush Edge in the Debate</p>
        <p>Aides believe that Mr. du Pont suffered in the debate somewhat from the lack of opportunity to respond directly to Mr. Bush's criticisms.</p>
        <p>''Our feeling was that he only got a chance to make half the argument,'' said Glenn Kenton, Mr. du Pont's campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>''I think in debating points it was very good for George,'' Mr. du Pont said in a recent interview. ''But I think in terms of substance, it gave me the distinction between someone who is looking ahead to the future and someone who is saying elect me for my resume and I'm for the status quo.''</p>
        <p>The optional retirement system is one of the five pillars of Mr. du Pont's campaign. Under the system, workers would continue to pay into Social Security but would have an option of also contributing to a separate account that they could draw from at retirement.</p>
        <p>Mr. du Pont is also proposing the creation of a voucher system to provide parents a choice schools for their children, random drug testing for high school students, required work for adults on welfare and the gradual elimination of Federal farm subsidies. Issues Worrying People</p>
        <p>Arguing that such proposals are related to what people are worrying about, Mr. du Pont tells audiences that one teen-ager in four is engaging in ''recreational'' drug use, that 450,000 schoolchildren in Chicago ''are trapped'' in a public school system they cannot leave and that the 70 million ''baby boomers'' will tax the Social Security System in 21st century.</p>
        <p>Trying to capture the nomination by focusing on those issues has brought ridicule from others, as well as skepticism. Recently, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, another challenger, dismissed Mr. du Pont as the candidate of the future, saying that his own concern was dealing with problems of today.</p>
        <p>Campaigning this week in Boston and New Hampshire, Mr. du Pont appeared to relish such attacks. He argued that such issues as the sharp gyrations on Wall Street and reducing the Federal deficit were transitory and that the uncertain economic climate was merely a ''challenge, not a crisis.''</p>
        <p>''The election is not about a $23 billion cut in the deficit,'' he told several dozen students at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. ''It's not about control on computer trading in the stock market and it's not about which tax is the best or fairest tax to raise in Washington. All of those are questions of today and this election is about tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>But with less than four months remaining before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, there is no evidence that the du Pont message is catching. Fears About Drug Proposal</p>
        <p>At Brandeis, Mr. du Pont was bombarded by questioners who were concerned that his drug-testing proposal would violate the rights of students. The skepticism was apparent elsewhere as the three-car du Pont motorcade traveled through New Hampshire, covering more than 200 miles and making nine stops in two days.</p>
        <p>At some, questioners doubted the constitutionality of the drug-testing plan; others wondered whether the voucher system would destroy public schools and still others questioned whether the optional retirement system would lead to the demise of Social Security.</p>
        <p>''I felt his concerns were well placed, but I'm not sure his solutions are practical ones that I would agree with,'' said Jerry Daley, an educator in Dover, who heard Mr. du Pont's remarks at a breakfast of the Somersworth Rotary Club.</p>
        <p>More than half the du Pont pledge cards that had been placed before about 35 people remained when they departed.</p>
