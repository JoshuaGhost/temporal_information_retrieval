        <p>LEAD:  To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 12 news article on the rising cost of college education, like many other such discussions, neglects one solution to the problem. It is the growth of the undergraduate nonresidence public junior college and the urban university system.</p>
        <p>Only a minority fraction of the population has ever ''gone off to school'' and still does. The continuing democratization of higher education in the form of public urban nonresidence institutions is taking place for good reason. It is just not cost-effective to send large numbers of students away from home to private and public residence universities. The so-called good in ''getting away from home'' has been and is a luxury for the minority and probably reflects an economic elitist mentality.</p>
        <p>Why are we not hearing about the urban institutions in discussions about rising undergraduate education costs? Probably because those who write and speak on such matters have been exposed only to the traditional system. Only now are the earliest graduates of the public urban universities climbing up the economic and prestige ladders.</p>
        <p>That is demonstrated by the difficulty new institutions have in organizing their alumni for purposes of institutional development, as the older ones have done. Time will change that situation, but recognition of the public urban institution as a solution to the rising cost of education must happen now! It is particularly important for upward mobility of the working class and minorities.</p>
        <p>To those who would say urban institutions are not up to the intellectual standards of the traditional ones, I point out that the recent breakthrough in high-temperature superconductivity was made at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and the University of Houston, both urban universities! Today's public urban university is populated with faculty members who received their graduate education at the traditional universities.</p>
        <p>My personal sensitivity to the change that is taking place is probably due to my having been a junior college student who came from a single-parent family headed by a female and was later an urban university undergrad with my own family. Pursuing graduate study, I attended a private traditional institution in Cleveland. It was in that city I witnessed the birth of a new ''high rise'' urban institution in the form of Cleveland State University.  THOMAS J. WDOWIAK  Associate Professor of Physics  University of Alabama  Birmingham, Ala., May 19, 1987</p>
