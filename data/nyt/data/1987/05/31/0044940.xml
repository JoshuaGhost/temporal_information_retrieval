        <p>LEAD: MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV is making the Germans nervous - East Germans and West Germans alike.</p>
        <p>MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV is making the Germans nervous - East Germans and West Germans alike.</p>
        <p>The Soviet leader has East German Communists fretting about the implications of his innovative course at home for their tightly run authoritarian state; on the other side of the border, West German strategists fear that the Soviet chief's aggressive pursuit of nuclear disarmament may leave them vulnerable to the conventional might of the Warsaw Pact and open to political blackmail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorbachev swept into East Berlin last week for a summit of Warsaw Pact leaders held in the restricted confines of a Swedish-built luxury hotel. He had stopped off in Bucharest, where he lectured President Nicolae Ceaucescu on the merits of ''openness and democracy'' in Communism, where each citizen should feel himself to be ''not just a simple cog in the machinery of the state but an autonomous personality and a creative person.''</p>
        <p>This message got a frosty reception from Mr. Ceaucescu, who has made himself the object of a quasi-imperial personality cult in impoverished Rumania. Striving for a more upbeat mood, Erich Honecker, the 74-year-old East German leader, greeted Mr. Gorbachev in East Berlin with effusive kisses - and Raisa Gorbachev with a comradely handshake.</p>
        <p>And, in contrast with the past, the East German media did not edit out the Russian's unsettling ''democratic'' utterances.</p>
        <p>The East Germans have made it plain that they have little to learn from Mr. Gorbachev's attempt to shake up the slothful Soviet economy. The Honecker approach has been to endorse Mr. Gorbachev's disarmament initiatives while remaining skeptical about his domestic course.</p>
        <p>''If your neighbor put up new wallpaper in his home, would you feel obliged to put up new wallpaper in your own?'' asked Kurt Hager, a 75-year-old East German Politburo member in a recent interview with a West German magazine.</p>
        <p>''We believe it would be wrong to oblige Germany to follow the Soviet way since it does not correspond to the current conditions of development in Germany.'' The party daily Neues Deutschland, significantly, carried this text.</p>
        <p>But the other side of East German arrogance is angst - fear that, notably in the realm of culture, the authorities will have to loosen the reins. Already, Pravda is eagerly snatched up at East German kiosks, and East German visitors to Moscow come home excited about the lively Russian cinema and arts scene.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Honecker, whose people already are lured at night by West German television, the winds of change from the east are chilling. Some Western diplomats in East Berlin believe that the East German is not yet convinced that Mr. Gorbachev will survive in power or stay his reformist course.</p>
        <p>Leaders like Mr. Ceausescu and Mr. Honeckerpresent a dilemma for Mr. Gorbachev. These gerontocrats have a demonstrated ability to keep their home fronts quiet, something the Russian leader needs if he is to bring about significant change within the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Yet in the longer term, Mr. Gorbachev will want an Eastern European leadership identified with and indebted to him - and not linked to the now discredited Brezhnev era.</p>
        <p>In East Germany, his man could turn out to be the fast-rising Berlin party leader, Gunther Schabowski, who is in his mid-50's and makes little secret of his aspiration to become a German Gorbachev. Mr. Honecker has been grooming Egon Krenz, a 50-year-old Politburo member who has a Russian wife, as his dauphin.</p>
        <p>In West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his conservative Christian Democrats have abandoned a rear-guard struggle to stave off a superpower accord abolishing medium- and shorter-range missiles in Europe. Mr. Kohl will, reluctantly, announce modified acceptance of Mr. Gorbachev's ''double zero'' proposal to the Bundestag this week.</p>
        <p>Yet the Christian Democrats' cave-in on the missile question has left many of them embittered with the Reagan Administration - which effectively backed the Soviet line on ''double zero''- and very nervous about the future.</p>
        <p>''We stand on the ruins of our nuclear stragey,'' a senior West German official commented privately at a gathering of NATO defense ministers in Brussels last week.</p>
        <p>Yet if both Germanys are being made edgy by the activist Mr. Gorbachev, they can take consolation in the fact that German-German relations are on solid footing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl has few foreign policy accomplishments to his credit, but one of his quiet achievements over the last five years has been to weave even more thickly the web of bilateral agreements and human contacts to the other German state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Honecker has been a willing partner in this enterprise, not because he is a closet German nationalist, but because good ties with West Germany are popular with his people. The number of East German visitors to West Germany is up sharply and East Berlin is exploring a big energy import deal with Bonn.</p>
        <p>The two Germanys have Gorbachev angst, but at least they have each other.</p>
