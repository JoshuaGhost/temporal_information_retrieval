        <p>LEAD: The American Ambassador to Bonn told senior West German officials today that the United States would not accept any deal that resulted in the early release of a Lebanese suspected in the hijacking of an airliner.</p>
        <p>The American Ambassador to Bonn told senior West German officials today that the United States would not accept any deal that resulted in the early release of a Lebanese suspected in the hijacking of an airliner.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that Ambassador Richard R. Burt delivered the message in Bonn following reports that a West German emissary had been negotiating for the release of two German businessmen held hostage in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Officials expressed concern that the negotiator, who has been in Iran and Lebanon, was discussing the release of the hijacking suspect after a short time in jail as a means of obtaining the release of the two Germans.</p>
        <p>''We are still interested in the extradition'' of the suspect, Mohammed Ali Hamadei, a Reagan Administration official said today. Mr. Hamadei is wanted in the United States on hijacking and murder charges for his role in the June 1985 hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet in which a United States Navy diver was slain. Denial in Bonn</p>
        <p>West Germany has yet to respond to the Administration's formal request for extradition. The official position of both governments is that the request is under study.</p>
        <p>In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry official who did not want to be identified denied that the Government might reject the American extradition request, according to the Associated Press. ''It's a rumor that keeps coming up,'' the official was quoted as saying. ''There is nothing to that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamadei was arrested at the Frankfurt airport on Jan. 15 after explosives were discovered in his baggage. Within a week the two West German businessmen were kidnapped in West Beirut in apparent retaliation.</p>
        <p>The Washington Post, quoting sources close to the kidnappers, said today that the West Germans were offering to release Mr. Hamadei and his brother, also held in Germany, after brief jail sentences, in order to obtain the release of the businessmen. ''That would be completely unacceptable,'' said a State Department official.</p>
        <p>The brother, Abbas Ali Hamadei, led the police to an explosives cache. More Delays Feared</p>
        <p>American officials are increasingly worried that Mr. Hamadei will never stand trial in the United States. State Department officials believe Bonn will not allow him to return to Lebanon in the near future for fear of incurring Washington's wrath, but the West Germans could delay any decision until interest abated.</p>
        <p>Mohammed Hamadei is being held in West Germany on charges relating to his attempt to smuggle explosives. Conviction on those charges would carry a sentence of only a few years, officials said. The hijacking and murder charges could mean life imprisonment. American officials said today that Bonn could fulfill its legal obligations by trying him there on hijacking charges.</p>
        <p>Several members of Congress have warned that any attempt to release Mr. Hamadei would seriously damage relations with Bonn. West German officials said that their negotiator, Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski, a member of Parliament, had just returned from Iran after exploring contacts with the kidnappers.</p>
