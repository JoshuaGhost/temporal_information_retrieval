        <p>LEAD: Finding jurors to serve in high-publicity criminal cases has never been easy, but the demands placed on those who will eventually decide charges that children were molested at the McMartin Preschool will be extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Finding jurors to serve in high-publicity criminal cases has never been easy, but the demands placed on those who will eventually decide charges that children were molested at the McMartin Preschool will be extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The jurors may have to serve up to two years, must have excellent memory and will be warned not to talk about the case with anyone, even a spouse.</p>
        <p>To help find such people, Judge William R. Pounders summoned 500 prospective jurors to the Los Angeles Superior Court recently and stressed that this was no ordinary trial.</p>
        <p>''The trial is somewhat unusual because we estimate it will take a year to present evidence to the jury, and in the worst situation possibly, if things go wrong during the trial, it might take a year and a half, possibly even two years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The trial will be a long one partly because it involves allegations that cover a five-year period. The defendants, Raymond Buckey, 28 years old, who has been in custody without bail for more than three years, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 60, who was released on bail last year, will stand trial on charges of sexually abusing 14 children. Both defendants face 99 counts of child molestation and one count of conspiracy. Scores of Witnesses Expected</p>
        <p>The trial will include testimony from at least 13 children as well as expert medical witnesses and probably the testimony of the defendants. In all, the prosecution has at least 200 potential witnesses.</p>
        <p>In the first week of jury selection, scores of potential jurors were dismissed for a variety of reasons, some medical, some economic. Judge Pounders repeatedly consulted a large notebook that contains information on companies and public agencies willing to pay wages for an unlimited period of time while an employee serves on a jury. These include public utilities, governmental agencies, the public school system and large corporations.</p>
        <p>Lael Rubin, the chief prosecutor, said she thought there would be fewer retired people than expected serving on the jury. ''One of the unexpected developments so far is there are large numbers of people over age 65 who cannot serve for medical reasons or because they are responsible for someone else,'' she said. Department Stores' Policy Helps</p>
        <p>Miss Rubin said she believed that, despite the length and difficulty of the case, both sides would ultimately find a fair cross section of people to serve, particularly, she said, because many of the area's largest department stores have an unlimited jury service policy.</p>
        <p>However, defense attorneys said they were worried that they would get neither a fair nor a representative jury because self-employed people, as well as those whose employers will not pay them beyond a fixed period, will not serve.</p>
        <p>Shari Seidman Diamond of the University of Illinois, a psychologist and lawyer who is an expert on juries and judicial decision-making, said there had been research on protracted cases.</p>
        <p>''What we found is that while there were some differences in the groups, the differences were surprisingly small,'' she said. ''On many of the longer jury cases, people perceived these cases to be extremely important and to put aside ther obligations in order to serve.'' Great Concentration Needed</p>
        <p>One of the difficulties, Professor Diamond said, is discovering those who want to serve on the jury. But she said the larger problem was the ability of jurors to focus on evidence in a long trial. ''It is an extraordinarily long period of time to demand that kind of attention,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The case is coming to trial three years after seven defendants, including the founding family of the preschool, in nearby Manhattan Beach, and three teachers, pleaded not guilty to hundreds of counts of molestation involving scores of children. After the longest and costliest preliminary hearing in the state's history, charges against five of the defendants were dropped. District Attorney Ira Reiner said the evidence against them was ''incredibly weak.''</p>
        <p>Thus far, the case has cost the taxpayers roughly $5 million, a figure that may well double by the trial's end. In recent months the marathon case burst back into the news when a former prosecutor in the case, Glenn Stevens, said he believed all the defendants were not guilty.</p>
        <p>Judge Pounders said that, given a pool of 3.5 million people, he was convinced a jury could be found. 'A Very Peculiar Person'</p>
        <p>Hans Zeisel, a professor of law at the University of Chicago, said, ''It is my view that no lawsuit should last as long as two years.'' Professor Zeisel was co-author, with Harry Kalven Jr., of ''The American Jury,'' a book considered by some legal scholars to be the definitive study on juries.</p>
        <p>Professor Zeisel said that by the end of jury selection, which is expected to take about eight weeks, the jury might well consist of more retired people and more women than are generally found in a shorter trial.</p>
        <p>Dean Gits, who represents Mrs. Buckey, said, ''We are picking up either retired people with a fixed income or we are picking up government people, U.S. Government or state or local government employees, teachers, whose salaries are paid for by an unlimited jury service policy.''</p>
        <p>Danny Davis, who represents Mr. Buckey, said he feared the jury selection would eliminate young people close to Mr. Buckey's age and those who are self-employed.</p>
