        <p>LEAD: The American Can Company has changed its name. ''American Can Company'' didn't fit anymore, said an explanatory ad in The New York Times last week, because the company no longer makes cans.</p>
        <p>The American Can Company has changed its name. ''American Can Company'' didn't fit anymore, said an explanatory ad in The New York Times last week, because the company no longer makes cans.</p>
        <p>The ad didn't explain why it quit making cans. Since ads naturally tend to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative, I assume an explanation of why it quit making cans was omitted because it might be embarrassing to the company.</p>
        <p>Suppose, for instance, that American Can had to get out of can manufacture because it couldn't make cans as good as the cans made in Japan, Korea or Taiwan.</p>
        <p>If so, it would be foolish to mention it in an ad announcing a name change, especially if you were changing the name from American Can to Primerica, because everybody would say, ''Instead of changing American Can to 'Primerica,' why not just change it to 'American Can't'?''</p>
        <p>I mean no slander of the company's can know-how, but merely note its curious silence on the vital can question. Instead of ineptitude at can-making, maybe the company's managers just got tired of running a business so lacking in mystery that a child, upon hearing its name, knew what it did.</p>
        <p>I have just now tested a child who happened to be handy:</p>
        <p>Tester: ''If a company is called American Can Company, what kind of business would it be in?'' Child: ''Make cans, I guess.'' Tester: ''Precisely. Now what about a company called Primerica?''</p>
        <p>Child: ''I don't know. Primerica?'' (Begins looking suspicious, then panicky.) ''I never heard of it.''</p>
        <p>Modern American business has a strong appetite for mystery. Corporate dynamos get no fun from businesses whose operations a child can easily visualize. There is no thrill in getting to the top of companies with names like International Horseshoe Disposal and Stainless Steel Battering Ram Inc., and Kitchenware Manufacturing Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mystery and bankruptcy: these are the goals of up-to-date corporate leaders. The two go hand-in-hand because, as every Harvard Business School graduate knows, the fewer people who can guess what your company does, the smaller the opposition to achieving bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>I don't want to give the impression that Primerica, nee American Can, is out to do anything but make scads of money; I merely observe that, having quit making cans, it is now engaged in activities very difficult for a child to envision.</p>
        <p>''We are the country's number one underwriter of individual life insurance,'' its ad states. ''One of the largest originators of home mortgages. And one of the nation's top managers of mutual funds and pension assets.''</p>
        <p>If I understand correctly, which is improbable, these former can-makers are now in the business of moving money around in ways that will make it make more money.</p>
        <p>There is more: ''Largest retailer of recorded music and audio/video products in the U.S. And one of the country's largest direct mail marketers.''</p>
        <p>Here I have to struggle a bit. Does this mean what it seems to mean? That good old American Can is now running a gigantic noise-infested chain of record and video shops and pumping out junk mail at a historic rate?</p>
        <p>It is very hard to visualize. No wonder the company wants to be called ''Primerica (pronounced pry-MER-i-ca).'' ''Primerica'' doesn't make you think of anything. It's such a nothing word that the company has to spend money to tell you how to pronounce it.</p>
        <p>This ad is beautifully done, however. It tells of the progress of Amer-ican business with metaphor and astonishing economy of words, picture and composition. Once upon a time, it tells us, American companies made things. Then they stopped making things and began making money, though some started selling amusements and gimcracks.</p>
        <p>The tale is poignantly illustrated with a full-page picture of John Wayne, used to explain the change to ''Primerica.'' Though born Marion Morrison, the type explains, ''When he broke into movies, he changed his name - 'Marion' just didn't seem to fit him anymore.''</p>
        <p>But the man in the photograph is not the lean, handsome Ringo Kid whom ''Marion Morrison'' didn't fit. Instead, it is the worn and paunchy old fellow in his 70's whose ponderous bulk, hoisted into the saddle, seemed to make his horses buckle in the middle in those last movies. It is a portrait of a man near the end of the road, taken shortly before his death. A sad picture if your mind also holds that other picture of the beautiful young Ringo Kid.</p>
        <p>So long, American Can. All right everybody, get those wagons drawn up in a circle and repeat after me: Primerica, Primerica, Primerica . . .</p>
