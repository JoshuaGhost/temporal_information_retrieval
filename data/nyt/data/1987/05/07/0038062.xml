        <p>LEAD: AS a test of the dramatic range of its principal actor, ''The Casting of Kevin Christian'' is brutal, and, in the performance given by Pete Benson at the American Renaissance Theater, often rewarding. As a test of an audience's understanding and sympathy, it is just brutal.</p>
        <p>AS a test of the dramatic range of its principal actor, ''The Casting of Kevin Christian'' is brutal, and, in the performance given by Pete Benson at the American Renaissance Theater, often rewarding. As a test of an audience's understanding and sympathy, it is just brutal.</p>
        <p>Without prompting, Stephen Holt's play - about the rehearsal of a play about a young man who is raped on a subway platform and becomes a vigilante - might call to mind the case of Bernhard Goetz, now on trial for shooting four youths on a subway train in 1984. But Mr. Holt is a loud prompter. Mr. Goetz is conjured up as ''a mythic figure'' early on, and in the final scene Kevin Christian, who has acted the part of the raped man, sits in a car of a Seventh Avenue express subway train, wearing the round glasses and leather bomber jacket familiar to us from many photographs of Mr. Goetz, railing against the sinister threats of city life and declaring he has found ''the American solution: I've bought a gun.''</p>
        <p>That transformation is the least likely in a series of preposterous changes in the character. For almost two hours Christian has been incredibly abused - mentally, morally and physically - by the director of the play within the play, a role taken by Mr. Holt himself. And while he has also been mugged in the street, an annoyingly fortuitous incident, if he were as smart as he is supposed to be, he would be stalking not subway criminals but the director. Now, that might have engaged the audience's sympathy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt treats his story as merely a platform on which he can play theater games. That is a pity, since the story has possibilities while the games are terribly cliched - but not as cliched as the pronouncements and inside jokes about theater that drone through the evening. In this cast only the formidable Ellaxis Smith wins smiles from such material - by playing it straight.</p>
        <p>At first glance Mr. Benson suggests a young made-for-television idol. But as Christian he displays a great range of emotion, passion and intellect. Mr. Holt throws mean curves at the actor in this role, and Mr. Benson connects impressively with most of them. He is an amusing, good-humored innocent at the outset and, as his character is turned into many improbable monsters, he has the cunning to let us know he has not lost his own good humor, no matter what the demands of this wild script.  AN AMERICAN SOLUTION - THE CASTING OF KEVIN CHRISTIAN, by Stephen Holt; directed by Michael Hillyer; sets by Cecil B. Songco and Phyllis Wilson; costumes by Natalie Barth Walker; lighting by Jeffery Corrick. Presented by the Wings Theater Company. At the Renaissance Theater, 112 Charlton Street.  Kevin Mark Christian...Pete Benson  Jack Marron Jr....Stephen Holt  Delores Wilson...Ellaxis Smith</p>
