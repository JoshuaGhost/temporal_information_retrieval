        <p>LEAD: Governor Cuomo and legislators appeared to move further apart on an ethics code today, with Mr. Cuomo sharply criticizing State Senate Republicans even as some lawmakers were accusing him of trying to undermine the negotiations for his own political gain.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo and legislators appeared to move further apart on an ethics code today, with Mr. Cuomo sharply criticizing State Senate Republicans even as some lawmakers were accusing him of trying to undermine the negotiations for his own political gain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo, in comments apparently intended to increase public pressure on Republicans, said this morning that ''I'm not enthusiastic about the Senate moving on the ethics bill.''</p>
        <p>He said his aides had informed him that senators were unwilling to agree to his demand that legislators and other state officials be completely prohibited from representing their law clients before state agencies. And he said the senators would not agree to full public disclosure of their finances. 'They Don't Want a Bill'</p>
        <p>''As long as that's true,'' the Governor said, ''then they don't want a bill.''</p>
        <p>But in a half-hour interview in his Capitol office, the leader of the Senate Republicans, Warren M. Anderson, said, ''I'd like to have a bill.''</p>
        <p>Offering what he said was ''a clearer picture of the situation'' than what the Governor had described, Senator Anderson said that after a Monday meeting by Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders, the Governor was to have sent the leaders a draft giving details of his specific proposals. But Mr. Anderson said that he did not receive the draft until midafternoon today and that the Governor did not call another meeting with the leaders. 'We Just Have to See'</p>
        <p>Asked if he agreed with comments by some Republican and Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Cuomo was hoping that no bill would be enacted so that he would have an issue to use against the Legislature, Mr. Anderson said: ''People have said that, and people in high places have indicated that. I think we just have to see how events play out. It depends on how he reacts.''</p>
        <p>''The fact that he didn't call another meeting or didn't send up material until just now,'' the Senator added, ''that certainly doesn't look like he's wild to have a bill. On the other hand, he hasn't made that statement to me yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson declined to list the specifics of the draft delivered to him today, saying the Governor and the leaders had agreed not to negotiate in public. But legislative aides said Mr. Cuomo sent three points to Mr. Anderson and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller.</p>
        <p>They also said the Governor's staff had further complicated the negotiations by raising a number of new issues that Mr. Cuomo had not raised when he vetoed an ethics code last month, including taking specific steps aimed at New York City officials. Appearing Before Agencies</p>
        <p>The three points delivered today included a provision that lawmakers and state officials be prohibited not just from physically appearing before state agencies on behalf of clients but also from communicating with the agencies in any way on behalf of clients.</p>
        <p>A second provision would prohibit officials from representing clients at state agencies' quasi-judicial proceedings. Such proceedings - similar to court arguments and held before an administrative hearing officer - include appeals of agency decisions, such as efforts to overturn a decision by the State Liquor Authority that denies a liquor license.</p>
        <p>Senator Anderson reaffirmed today the Senate's longstanding position that lawmakers should be allowed to continue to handle such cases, arguing that the proceedings were similar to court appearances, which would continue to be allowed under the Governor's proposal. Disclosure of Finances</p>
        <p>The third point in the Governor's draft would require wider disclosure of the finances of legislators and other officials, along the lines of a bill that was passed by the Democratic-controlled Assembly last year but that was blocked in the Republican-led Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said that Senate Republicans would accept full disclosure to a review panel but that they did not believe an official's personal finances, which he said were ''unrelated'' to government, should be open to scrutiny by just anyone.</p>
        <p>The Senator stressed that one aspect of having a part-time Legislature - a ''citizen legislature,'' he called it -was that lawmakers hold other jobs and that an ethics code could not be so strict as to prevent that.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, top legislators made clear that they were aware that a failure to reach an ethics agreement, even if partly the fault of the Governor, would reflect badly on them in the public's eyes. As a result, despite pessimism by their aides, the leaders went out of their way to stress that all was not lost.</p>
        <p>''At this point,'' said Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, ''I don't think we've reached the stage of impossibility.''</p>
