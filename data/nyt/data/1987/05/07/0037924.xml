        <p>LEAD: A former Chilean Army major who admitted he lied to further a cover-up of the assassination in 1976 of a retired Chilean diplomat was sentenced today to from 27 months to 84 months in prison.</p>
        <p>A former Chilean Army major who admitted he lied to further a cover-up of the assassination in 1976 of a retired Chilean diplomat was sentenced today to from 27 months to 84 months in prison.</p>
        <p>The former major, Armando Fernandez Larios, was sentenced by Judge Barrington Parker of the Federal District Court. He pleaded guilty Feb. 4 to being an accessory after the fact to the assassination on Sept. 21, 1976, of the former diplomat, Orlando Letelier.</p>
        <p>The victim, who had served the elected Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens, was an outspoken opponent of the Government of Augusto Pinochet, who took power as Chile's President in a coup that overthrew Mr. Allende in 1973. Implicates Pinochet</p>
        <p>In pleading guilty, Mr. Fernandez, 37 years old, said he had been told to lie about his involvement in the case by military superiors, and he implicated General Pinochet in the cover-up.</p>
        <p>''The defendant Fernandez has taken a giant step in offering his plea,'' Judge Parker said. ''He has pulled back the cover'' on an attempt by his military superiors to cover up their involvement in the murder plot, he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Judge Parker said, ''The stark fact remains he was a participant in criminal activity.'' The judge said that lies by Mr. Fernandez had ''prevented the extradition of others to the United States, allowing them to escape apprehension.''</p>
        <p>Judge Parker described the assassination of Mr. Letelier, a former Ambassador to the United States, as an ''act of terrorism.'' Another's Sentence a Factor</p>
        <p>Mr. Letelier and an associate, Ronni Moffitt, died after a bomb exploded beneath their car as it rounded a circle on Embassy Row in Washington. Ms. Moffitt's husband, Michael, was wounded.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker said that in passing sentence he would take into consideration the prison term served by Michael V. Townley, an American-born Chilean intelligence agent who admitted planting the bomb beneath Mr. Letelier's car. Mr. Townley, who pleaded guilty in 1978, served 40 months.</p>
