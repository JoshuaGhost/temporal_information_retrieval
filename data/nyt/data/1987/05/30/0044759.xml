        <p>LEAD: Janet Towe saw her obstetrician in North Dallas the other day. Then she went next door to leave samples of blood for routine prenatal testing at OB-GYN Physicians' Laboratory Inc., a facility owned by her doctor and 29 other physicians.</p>
        <p>Janet Towe saw her obstetrician in North Dallas the other day. Then she went next door to leave samples of blood for routine prenatal testing at OB-GYN Physicians' Laboratory Inc., a facility owned by her doctor and 29 other physicians.</p>
        <p>Her blood samples were sent by messenger to a large automated laboratory in southwestern Dallas, where they were processed along with thousands of other batches.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Towe, whose tests detected no problems, is one of millions of Americans whose body fluids and tissues are submitted to testing every day to help assess their health. Such diagnostic testing has grown dramatically in the last 10 years, spurred by advances in medicine and technology as well as by economic and legal pressures on the physicians who order the tests. Cost Estimated at $27 Billion</p>
        <p>Testing is estimated to cost as much as $27 billion this year, or about 6 percent of the nation's total health care expenditure of more than $425 billion.</p>
        <p>Authorities on health care are now debating the need for some of the testing in light of the cost. The nation's largest health insurer has issued guidelines on when testing is medically appropriate.</p>
        <p>The tests, conducted in hospitals, independent laboratories and in doctors' offices, have taken on a growing and sometimes controversial role in American society. For patients, the tests can pinpoint problems and thus accelerate treatment. Doctors use them to supplement their medical judgment and help fend off malpractice lawsuits. For thousands of doctors who have set up testing facilities in their offices in the last few years, the tests can also be an important source of income, some experts say.</p>
        <p>When the testing is for signs of AIDS infection, or when employers order screening for illicit drugs, the results can determine who is hired, promoted or dismissed.</p>
        <p>In Mrs. Towe's tests, which are generally accepted as routine in pregnancies, the Dallas laboratory took a blood count and ran a 24-test analysis of her blood chemistry, determined her blood type and Rh factor, and did routine screening for syphilis and German measles, diseases that may threaten an unborn child. Her obstetrician had also ordered a less common test that meant a sample of blood serum had to be sent to International Clinical Laboratories Inc. in Nashville.</p>
        <p>The company, which owns the Dallas facility and also manages OB-GYN Laboratory, returned the results to a computer printer in the OB-GYN Laboratory within days of her visit to the doctor. Sharp Growth Cited</p>
        <p>William C. O'Neil, president and chief executive of International Clinical Laboratories, said in an interview in Nashville that the company ran 80,000 tests a day in 15 regional facilities. They range from a standard $10 urinalysis all the way to a new $650 process for testing cancer cells' sensitivity to six drugs used in chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>The company is part of an industry in which, analysts estimate, there has had a fourfold to fivefold increase in spending since 1970. Mr. O'Neil said his company's annual sales grew from $4 million in 1970 to $200 million this year, including $60 million of growth from acquiring other companies.</p>
        <p>In the same period, he estimated, national spending on testing rose ''from 4 or 5 billion dollars to about 20 billion dollars today.'' The National Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, the country's largest health insurer, gave an even higher estimate - about $27 billion a year. A Fifth of Tests Called Unneeded</p>
        <p>By comparison, national spending on drugs and medical supplies was $28.5 billion in 1985, according to the latest Government figures on health care costs. In 1970 spending on drugs and supplies was $8 billion.</p>
        <p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials contend that perhaps 20 percent of all tests ''do not aid in the diagnosis or treatment of illness.'' On April 2, the association and the American College of Physicians, a professional group of internists, announced new guidelines to help physicians decide when to order tests. After a year of explaining the guidelines to doctors, Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials plan to begin denying payment for tests deemed unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neil said the Blue Cross appraisal was ''absurd.'' He said nearly all tests were ordered because a doctor needed the information.</p>
        <p>William B. Zeiler, president-elect of the College of American Pathologists, made up largely of physicians who direct laboratories, also takes issue with the guidelines as too restrictive and ''not in the best interest of the patient'' who might miss out on the timely discovery of a health problem.</p>
        <p>The standards were endorsed by several physicians' professional societies and by Robert L. Habig, president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. Advances in Technology Cited</p>
        <p>The Federal Government may consider adopting the guidelines for Medicare, the insurance program for 30 million elderly and disabled Americans, according to Christopher Bladen, a planning official at the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>The national expansion in testing is a result of advances in medicine and technology, Mr. O'Neil says, noting, ''Most of the industry's growth has been in tests that just weren't available in 1970.''</p>
        <p>New automated and computerized machines perform 24 tests, like the analysis of Mrs. Towe's blood, on 150 samples an hour. ''Some of our regional labs send printouts by computer modem into the hospital lab, and even to the patient's floor in some hospitals,'' Mr. O'Neil said.</p>
        <p>The six biggest testing companies have combined annual sales of about $1.4 billion, Mr. O'Neil said. In addition to his company, they are SmithKline Clinical Laboratories, a subsidiary of the SmithKline Beckman Corporation; MetPath Inc., owned by Corning Glass Works; Roche Biomedical Laboratories Inc., part of F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; Company; National Health Laboratories, owned by Revlon Inc., and the Damon Corporation.</p>
        <p>But at least 90 percent of the diagnostic testing is done by 7,000 small laboratories, hundreds of hospitals and small testing facilities in tens of thousands of physicians' offices.</p>
        <p>No one keeps track of spending for tests. The Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, has records for only one type of testing: Medicare's payments to independent laboratories outside hospitals. Payments soared from $11 million in 1970 to $114 million in 1980 to $555 million in 1985. The increase may be in part a result of changes in Government policies on containing hospital costs; in addition, Medicare costs over all have been spiraling upward. A Scattering of Regulation</p>
        <p>The Government sets standards for the educational credentials of supervisers and technicians and for the accuracy of testing machines in hospital and independent laboratories. Twenty-six states also have some form of regulation for independent laboratories; most states license hospitals and regulate their laboratories somewhat. Physicians' office laboratories are not regulated at all.</p>
        <p>Most physicians monitor test results closely and order a rerun if results seem unusual and thus questionable.</p>
        <p>Health care analysts say that in addition to aiding medical judgments, testing is ordered as a way to protect against malpractice suits. Whether medically needed or not, tests ordered in the practice of such ''defensive medicine'' become part of a record intended to convince a jury that every possible precaution was taken.</p>
        <p>Henry M. Weinert, an industry analyst who heads Boston Biomedical Consultants Inc., a management consulting company, estimates that defensive medicine accounts for 30 percent of all diagnostic testing. Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, an authority on health care policy at Princeton, said a new study ''attributes as much as 15 percent of total physician billings to defensive medicine.'' 'Ways to Offset Revenue Loss'</p>
        <p>Part of the increase in testing, Mr. Weinert said, stems from a need to offset lost revenue as the supply of doctors has increased competition.</p>
        <p>Professor Reinhardt said some physicians charged far more for tests conducted in their own offices than other laboratories would charge. He cited ''a $10 test that was billed to a large Midwestern company as $130.''</p>
        <p>A 1986 report commissioned by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 40,000 physicians had laboratories in their offices. They have purchased thousands of relatively inexpensive, simplified testing machines that can be operated by a nurse or technician.</p>
        <p>''The machines are good,'' said Herbert K. Naito, a physiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, But he said the reliability of the results could be enhanced ''by training the person doing the test -nurses, secretaries and receptionists.''</p>
        <p>Congress has directed the Administration to study whether Federal standards should be imposed to assure proper use of the laboratories in physicians' offices. But with the Department of Health and Human Services already at odds with physicians over limits on their fees for Medicare patients, according to one Federal health planning official who asked not to be named, the Administration is loath to start a potential new battle over the laboratory issue.</p>
