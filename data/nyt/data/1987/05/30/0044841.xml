        <p>LEAD:  COMPANIES</p>
        <p>COMPANIES</p>
        <p>Claims of asbestos victims would be paid by the largest possible number of insurers under a much-awaited ruling by a California judge. The ruling, which is expected to increase the amount of money available for people with asbestos-related diseases, involved the question of which insurance policies would be liable to claims: those in effect at the time of exposure, at the time of diagnosis or death, or at any time in between.  [ Page 1. ]</p>
        <p>The debt of Allegis is being reviewed for possible downgrading by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's because of the company's proposed recapitalization plan. An investor group that planned to try to take control of Allegis declined to comment on the plan.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>General Dynamics has paid the Government $1.8 million in penalties to settle a dispute over improper charges levied by the company's Convair division in San Diego on a contract with NASA.  [ 38. ]</p>
        <p>Unocal Corporation has suspended for 90 days its $2.5 billion lawsuit against Goldman, Sachs, which it has accused of leaking sensitive information during a 1985 takeover fight.  [ 47. ] THE ECONOMY</p>
        <p>The Fed will permit Chemical New York to run a limited-service bank in Florida that will make consumer loans and take deposits but not make business loans. It was the first creation of a limited-service bank since February 1985, but only a modest increase in the number of limited-service banks is expected to follow.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>The index of leading indicators fell 0.6 percent in April, the biggest decline in two years. But much of the drop could be attributed to the fact that the workweek component was based on the week that included the Good Friday and Passover holidays, and analysts saw little long-term significance in the April drop.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>The New York Fed bought more than $4 billion in foreign exchange, almost all in Japanese yen, in the three months ended April 30. It was the biggest U.S. purchase since the late 1970's, and total trading by Group of 10 nations was the busiest since the current system of floating exchange rates was instituted in 1973.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>The prices received by farmers for raw products jumped an average of 3.2 percent in May from the April index and were above the level a year earlier for the third consecutive month.  [ 38. ] MARKETS</p>
        <p>The Commodity Exchange will remove limits on how much the price of its gold, silver, copper and aluminum contracts can fluctuate in any single day. The rule change, which will take effect Monday, still requires approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become permanent.  [ 37. ]</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. postponed a decision on whether to permit the New York Stock Exchange to weaken its one-share, one-vote rule as progress was reportedly being made in negotiations on a common standard for the various exchanges.  [ 39. ]</p>
        <p>Trading on Wall Street was mixed. Most issues moved higher even though the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.11, to 2,291.57. Program selling was cited as a cause for the drop in the Dow, which still gained 48.37 for the week. Big Board volume was a listless 153.5 million shares, virtually the same as on Thursday.  [ 40. ]</p>
        <p>The dollar edged higher against most major foreign currencies in active but narrow trading. Gold declined $1 an ounce, to $450, in New York.  [ 46. ]  Gold futures also fell, with traders saying the dollar's recent gains had eased inflation worries.  [ 46. ]</p>
        <p>Note and bond prices rose modestly as the Japanese stimulus package encouraged some credit market participants to be hopeful that the stability in the dollar would continue.  [ 40. ] INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>Japan's $43 billion economic package will produce results, Prime Minister Nakasone said, as officials in Tokyo sought to head off criticism from trading partners.  [ 39. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS</p>
        <p>Unit investment trusts have been gaining favor as interest rates rise and a wider choice of portfolios are offered. Some notable examples: Australian-New Zealand trusts with returns of almost 16 percent, stock trusts and junk bond trusts. Your Money.  [ 38. ]</p>
        <p>An anti-terrorist patrol vehicle was patented this week. Despite a conventional appearance, it has a machine gun that can be extended through the roof. Patents.  [ 38. ]</p>
