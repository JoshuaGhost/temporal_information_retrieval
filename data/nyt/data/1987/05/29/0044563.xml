        <p>LEAD: According to a joke making the rounds here these days, Vilma Espin, the highest-ranking woman in the Communist Party and the wife of Fidel Castro's brother Raul, knocks on the door of a family in the capital.</p>
        <p>According to a joke making the rounds here these days, Vilma Espin, the highest-ranking woman in the Communist Party and the wife of Fidel Castro's brother Raul, knocks on the door of a family in the capital.</p>
        <p>A housewife asks, ''Who's there?'' and Miss Espin replies brightly, ''The best-known woman in Cuba.''</p>
        <p>With that, the housewife calls over her shoulder, ''Children, come quickly! Esmeralda is here!''</p>
        <p>Esmeralda is not an endearing nickname for Miss Espin. Esmeralda is the title character in a soap opera that was broadcast daily for months on Radio Marti, a branch of the Voice of America transmitting exclusively to Cuba.</p>
        <p>Esmeralda has been superseded by other Radio Marti soap operas. But as the special programming to Cuba goes into its second year, Cubans still tell the joke to illustrate the scope of Radio Marti's audience.</p>
        <p>''Everybody listens,'' said a taxi driver, who added that he would prefer not to have his name published in connection with a broadcast service that has infuriated Mr. Castro and chilled the already cool relations between the United States and Cuba. News and Family Messages</p>
        <p>Radio Marti is on the air 17 1/2 hours daily from studios in Washington with music, news, entertainment, sports, discussions of such things as politics, religion and health, horoscope readings and, once a week, an hour of taped personal messages from Cubans in the United States to relatives and friends back home.</p>
        <p>The soap operas and music shows seem to have the largest following. But Cubans and foreign residents in Cuba say many people also seem to be tuning to Radio Marti's news and commentary programs, which pepper the island with things Mr. Castro would rather his people did not hear: interviews with recent defectors, accounts of the AIDS epidemic in Africa, where 30,000 Cuban troops are stationed, and charges by United States officials - which the Cuban Government has denied - that Cuban officials are involved in narcotics trafficking.</p>
        <p>Some senior Cuban officials grudgingly concede that Radio Marti is being listened to widely. But the formal Government position is that listenership is low and that most Cubans do not take the broadcasts seriously. Cost Is $12 Million a Year</p>
        <p>Western diplomats say the broadcasts clearly are providing information to Cubans that was not previously available. But some of them question whether it is worth the nearly $12 million in annual operating expenses and the friction it has created between the United States and Cuba.</p>
        <p>A few months before Radio Marti went on the air, May 20, 1985, the United States and Cuba signed their first major accord in seven years. The agreement was to enable 20,000 Cubans to leave for the United States annually, providing a social pressure valve for Mr. Castro, and permitting the United States to deport 2,700 Cuban undesirables, criminals and mental patients who landed in the United States in 1980 and, to the embarrassment of the United States, were being held in prisons.</p>
        <p>With the signing of the agreement, the Cubans began to think that, in the spirit of conciliation, the Reagan Administration would find a way to quietly drop the idea of Radio Marti, which had been approved by Congress nearly two years earlier. Castro Suspended Accord</p>
        <p>When that proved to be a mistaken assumption, Mr. Castro acted as if he had been double-crossed and suspended the emigration agreement. Last summer, he sent word through the Soviet Union that he felt he had overreacted. But negotiations to revive the agreement went nowhere.</p>
        <p>Ernesto F. Betancourt, a onetime Castro supporter who is director of Radio Marti, and others who take pleasure in annoying Mr. Castro are pleased with the way the broadcasting is going.</p>
        <p>''We know we're making an impact,'' Mr. Betancourt said in a recent interview in Miami.</p>
        <p>One indication of the Cuban Government's concern about Radio Marti, he says, is that the Government has livened up its own radio and television broadcasting and has announced plans to spend twice as much in this field over the next five years as it spent in the first 25 years of Mr. Castro's rule. Cubans Jam Broadcasts</p>
        <p>From the start, the Cuban Government has been jamming Radio Marti by transmitting a humming noise on the station's 1180 AM frequency. The noise is annoying, but it does not block the programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betancourt says he believes that it was a stream of Radio Marti broadcasts on AIDS that led the Cuban Government to disclose in mid-April that three Cubans had died of the disease and that 108 others, found to have the virus, had been quarantined in a special medical unit near Havana.</p>
        <p>Knowledgeable Cubans say that the Cuban Government has assigned a staff to monitor Radio Marti and that summaries of its news reports and commentaries are distributed to radio, television and newspaper offices.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the Government recasts Radio Marti items from Havana's point of view without a hint of the material's origin. Other times, the Government uses the Radio Marti material as a point of departure. The name Radio Marti is never mentioned in Government broadcasts or publications; the reference is often something like ''the Yankee imperialist radio broadcasts against Cuba.'' An Anti-Castro Tone</p>
        <p>Some Cubans and foreigners living in Havana say that the tone of Radio Marti and its selections of news and commentary are clearly anti-Castro and that this gives it less credibility than its predecessor, the Latin American service of the Voice of America. Mr. Betancourt said it was inevitable that the station would be regarded as partisan because its mandate was to provide material that, ''for whatever reason, the Cuban Government didn't want to come out.''</p>
        <p>Since the first of this year, an unusually high number of Cubans -more than 50 - have fled across the treacherous Gulf Stream to Florida on flimsy craft made of inner tubes. The Cuban Government charges that this is being encouraged by Radio Marti.</p>
        <p>Mr. Betancourt says it is true that Radio Marti broadcasts interviews with those who make it to Florida. But he says the station is careful not to give any details on how the refugees arrive. Furthermore, he says the station has carried interviews with United States Coast Guard officials underlining the dangers of such a crossing.</p>
