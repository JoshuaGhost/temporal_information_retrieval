        <p>LEAD:  TWAIN'S SOUVENIRS  When Mark Twain and his Hartford neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe, traveled abroad, they bought the tourist souvenirs now on exhibit in the basement gallery of the Twain House at 77 Forest Avenue. The exhibition is a collection of some 40 items picked up around the world by Twains and his family, the Stowes and their relatives, the Beechers and the Days, all of whom inhabited Nook Farm, as the compound was called, and by Charles Dudley Warner, Twain's collaborator on the writing of ''The Gilded Age.</p>

        <p>TWAIN'S SOUVENIRS  When Mark Twain and his Hartford neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe, traveled abroad, they bought the tourist souvenirs now on exhibit in the basement gallery of the Twain House at 77 Forest Avenue. The exhibition is a collection of some 40 items picked up around the world by Twains and his family, the Stowes and their relatives, the Beechers and the Days, all of whom inhabited Nook Farm, as the compound was called, and by Charles Dudley Warner, Twain's collaborator on the writing of ''The Gilded Age.''</p>
        <p>Such exotica as a purse made from an alligator's claw were purchased by Stowe while she lived in Florida. A hatbox for Twain's top hat, a meerschaum pipe, beads from an Egyptian mummy, a pillow cover autographed by Twain then embroidered by its admiring owner, menus collected during a two-week steamer trip across the Atlantic, a loving cup presented to Twain by Oxford University, a pierced wood screen from a Middle East harem and pieces of furniture and clothing present a picture of vacationing Americans more mundane that one might have imagined.</p>
        <p>A tour of the 20-room Twain mansion, handsomely restored to its Victorian splendor, is included in the admission charge of $3.75 for adults and $1.50 for children. Admission to the more modest eight-room Stowe house is $3 and $1.25 for children. A combination ticket to both may be purchased for $6 and $2.75 for children. Call 525-9317 for more information. PARTY FOR A MURAL Restoration of a five-panel mural by Thomas Hart Benton will be financed, in part, by revenues from a party to be given by the New Britain Museum of American Art, 65 Lexington Street, at 6 P.M. Saturday. The building's interior will be decorated in 1920's New Orleans style, and guests are invited to come in costumes of the Jazz Age, the Old South or in black tie. Jazz and Dixieland bands, horse-and-buggy rides, a Cajun dinner, dancing and an art auction are scheduled throughout the evening. Tickets cost $75 a person and may be reserved by calling 229-5027. BOOMERANG INSIGHTS</p>
        <p>What makes a boomerang work? The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven will have the answer to this and other questions about the Australian weapon during Boomerang Day, from 2:30 to 6 P.M. Saturday. Events begin with Ben Ruhe, captain of the United States Boomerang Team, who will show a film and discuss the history and making of boomerangs in the museum at 170 Whitney Avenue.</p>
        <p>At 3:30 P.M. visitors will head for Yale Playing Field A at Chapel Street and Yale Avenue where expert boomerang throwers and the United States team will demonstrate techniques. Free lessons will be offered to children 8 years old and older with boomerangs supplied. Amateur throwers may enter a tournament with a division for children from 8 to 12 or an open division for ages 13 and older. Winners will receive trophies. Admission to the indoor program is $2 for adults and $1 for children; admission to the field events is $1 for adults and 50 cents for children. Call 432-5799 for more information. NEWTONIAN DISPLAY</p>
        <p>The story of the apple falling to the ground is included in an exhibition of Isaac Newton's manuscripts on view at the Burndy Library in Norwalk through December. Marking the 300th anniversary of the publication of Newton's ''Principia,'' the display features a copy of the 1687 work, documents signed by Newton, portraits and a marble bust of the mathematician that belonged to Sir Robert Peel, engravings, coins and a medal bearing Newton's likeness. The Burndy Library is on Richard Avenue, off the Post Road. It is open from 8:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Monday through Friday. The telephone number for more information is 852-8594. FIVE-MINUTE APPRAISALS</p>
        <p>Antiquarians from Christie's will provide verbal appraisals for a wide range of objects brought in by the public to the Greenwich Library auditorium, 101 West Putnam Avenue from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday. Porcelain, glass, jewelry, watches, paintings, prints, drawings, rugs, silver and other aceptable items will receive a five-minute inspection. A maximum of three items per person will cost $25; the charge for a single item is $10. Size is limited to pieces that may be carried by hand, or photographs for large pieces of furniture. A removable part, such as a drawer, may be brought in. Excluded are books, coins, stamps, armor, weapons, automobiles, pre-Columbian, Greek, Roman and other antiquities. The library's telephone number is 622-7900. GALLERY OPEN HOUSE</p>
        <p>Prints by Sol LeWitt, Richard Diebenkorn, Alex Katz, Elaine de Kooning, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Robert Longo and others will be offered for sale, priced from $400 to $2,500 by Real Art Ways during an open house from 4 to 10 P.M. Saturday at 94 Allyn Street, Hartford. The prints will be on exhibit through this week in the gallery.</p>
        <p>Admission to the open house is free and includes a talk by John Paoletti, professor of art history at Wesleyan University, who will speak briefly about the prints and the progress of American printmaking for the last quarter of a century. Highlights of the gallery's year recorded on videotape will be shown, the Real Art Ways House Band will entertain with Neo-Dixieland jazz, and food and drink will be served free of charge.</p>
        <p>At 8:30 P.M. Anthony de Mare, pianist, will perform works by George Antheil, Frank Zappa, John Cage and Robert Carl. Tickets will be available at the box office for $5, or call 525-5521 for reservations. ECONOMIC FORECAST</p>
        <p>An economic forecast for Connecticut and the Northeast will be the focus of a joint meeting sponsored by the Wharton Economics Regional Service and the Economic Club of Connecticut, scheduled from 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Friday at the Sheraton Stamford Hotel. Whether the Connecticut economy has priced itself out of the market with rising wages and housing costs, and the effect of a cut in defense spending on the Connecticut economy are some of the questions to be addressed.</p>
        <p>Serving as speakers and on panels are senior staff members of Wharton Economics at Penn State University, and a variety of Connecticut officials and business executives, including Peter F. Burns of the Department of Economic Development, James Green of Southern New England Telephone and David J. Walker of People's Bank. Admission is $50 and includes lunch. Call 325-3535 for reservations or more information.</p>
