        <p>LEAD: GRADUATION time - the grand finale of the school year. It's a heady time, a strong brew of final exams, proms, plans, and pomp and circumstance.</p>
        <p>GRADUATION time - the grand finale of the school year. It's a heady time, a strong brew of final exams, proms, plans, and pomp and circumstance.</p>
        <p>For high school faculty members like myself, it's an intense time of work, with the summer vacation shimmering like the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (unless a summer job is needed to make ends meet, or pay for the children's college education). There's a certain poignancy to the year's end, though. One of the most satisfying aspects of being an educator in a high school is that we get to know students well as they mature from giggly, sometimes whiny ninth graders into mature, intelligent young adults ready to ''go out into the world.''</p>
        <p>And that's where, increasingly, a bittersweet taste intrudes into the prosaic sugary well-wishing of graduation time. For more and more, the economic news we read, both about Long Island and the nation at large, warns that young people, new entrants into the job and housing markets, will be hard-pressed not to experience downward mobility, in sharp contrast to the overall increase in the standard of living that working Americans have experienced during the post-World War II economic boom.</p>
        <p>The realization that the middle-class suburban life style that many (though not all) students have enjoyed is becoming more elusive is the subject of a spate of reports and a depressing plethora of data. According to a 1986 study by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, of the nine million jobs created from 1979 to 1985, 44 percent paid $7,000 or less. Many of these were service-sector jobs, as compared with higher-wage manufacturing jobs.</p>
        <p>Here on Long Island, service jobs increasingly predominate as manufacturing plants have been driven off Long Island by high energy and transportation costs. A draft report prepared recently by the Economic Research Bureau at the State University of New York at Stony Brook pointed out that in addition to an increasing erosion of ''middle-class opportunities for many Islanders,'' the high cost of living here, and in particular the prohibitively high cost of housing here, denies to many young people the option of remaining on Long Island to set up their own households.</p>
        <p>Since I grew up on Long Island myself and returned here after college voluntarily and gladly, the ebbing away of the ''hometown'' choice, the idea that young people have no alternative but to uproot themselves, strikes me as especially harsh and unfortunate. A lackluster economic future for Long Island translates into some painful and disappointing life choices for year after year of local high school graduates.</p>
        <p>Alongside the outpouring of economic reports and the intensification of debate about the region's and nation's economic future has been a search for ''educational reform,'' another expression of a sense that optimism, quality and upward mobility are eluding us, this time on the educational front. But reviewing the education reports, rarely do I find placed squarely at the center of attention the specter of economic slowdown and downward mobility that is facing a large number of young people.</p>
        <p>Yet such an ''interdisciplinary'' approach seems eminently reasonable and necessary. Not only does household economic insecurity affect students' outlook; dismal economic prospects can't help but reduce students' motivations.</p>
        <p>We see these connections in their most pronounced form among our most economically disadvantaged children.</p>
        <p>A sense of pessimism about one's future may contribute to high dropout rates. Conversely, for a class of Harlem students, college tuition guaranteed by a philanthropic millionaire has produced high achievement, high graduation rates and high hopes.</p>
        <p>In the suburbs, where our seeming affluence leads us to gloss over the public aspects of economic prospects, these same patterns may prevail in a more muted form.</p>
        <p>For educators, and for Long Islanders concerned about the economic future for themselves and the younger generation, it seems that just as families are facing the fact that real income has dropped since its peak in 1973, we must realize that economic realities will increasingly intrude into our classrooms. Daily we deal with the apparent and the subtle impacts of the economy, for better and worse, on young people.</p>
        <p>We need to think about how we can exert our forces on those who exercise economic influence and power to insure that Long Island students bring with them into the classroom a confidence about the economic future. We may want to subject whatever economic planning is taking place on Long Island to scrutiny, and to be dogged and determined in seeing to it that the economy's ''invisible hand'' isn't left free to push despairing students out of the schoolroom door and into an unpromising fu-ture.</p>
