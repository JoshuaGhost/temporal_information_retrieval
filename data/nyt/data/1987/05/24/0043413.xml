        <p>LEAD: AFTER several rounds of tough sparring in a Federal courtroom in Manhattan, what would have been the first trial in the insider trading scandal was temporarily called off last week, leaving both sides to claim a measure of victory.</p>
        <p>AFTER several rounds of tough sparring in a Federal courtroom in Manhattan, what would have been the first trial in the insider trading scandal was temporarily called off last week, leaving both sides to claim a measure of victory.</p>
        <p>The delay was prompted by the Government, which dropped the indictments against three Wall Street arbitragers in what was an attempt to gain more time to prepare new charges.</p>
        <p>Some experts said the proceedings against the traders appeared to create opportunities for the defense to challenge any subsequent charges.</p>
        <p>However, the indefinite delay has added to, not relieved, the uncertainty on Wall Street over how far the investigation will go. Two Government disclosures added to the anxiety. In moving to drop the indictments, the Federal prosecutors referred to unnamed ''co-conspirators.'' The prosecution also said it was trying to compel witnesses to testify who earlier refused to do so, a statement that was interpreted to mean they were being granted immunity.</p>
        <p>All that actually happened last week was the decision by Federal District Judge Louis L. Stanton to dismiss the charges against Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company; Richard B. Wigton, former head of arbitrage at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, and Timothy L. Tabor, a former trader at Kidder, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors said they had uncovered a far broader conspiracy, involving the trading on insider information related to nine takeover-related stocks, rather than the two mentioned in the original indictment.</p>
        <p>Spirited verbal combat briefly heated up the hearings, giving the defense lawyers their first opportunity to throw a few punches. It also gave a preview of the kinds of technical challenges they may use. ''It was just legal skirmishing,'' said Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But defense lawyers believes they caught the United States Attorney's office off balance, pointing to its admission that it could not meet its own deadline for delivering an expanded indictment. The Government also acknowledged that it had moved too soon when it arrested the three investment bankers last February and that it might have lost if a trial had begun Wednesday, as scheduled, on the original indictment.</p>
        <p>Once the dust settled, though, the Government had won an important victory. It now has all the time it wants to prepare an expanded indictment.</p>
        <p>In the view of some legal experts, the defense lawyers scored points with arguments that their clients deserved a speedy trial. ''The lesson was that these are not just abstract legal maneuverings,'' said Andrew Lawler, Mr. Tabor's lawyer. ''You have a human being out there with a real problem who wants to clear his name.''</p>
        <p>One of the most hotly debated issues in the case was the Government's decision to arrest the three executives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman and Mr. Wigton were arrested at their offices, with Mr. Wigton led past his colleagues in handcuffs. Mr. Tabor was arrested at his home and spent a night in jail.</p>
        <p>Their attorneys have argued that this ''humiliation'' was unnecessary because their clients would have voluntarily reported to the United States Attorney's office if summoned.</p>
        <p>The arrests set the stage for the first serious legal battle since the scandal broke a year ago. The men were the first traders to plead not guilty after being publicly implicated. Mr. Giuliani has won 10 guilty pleas without a trial, starting with Dennis Levine and including Ivan F. Boesky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman was charged with swapping insider tips about takeover bids with Martin Siegel, formerly of Kidder, and then trading illegally on that information. Mr. Siegel pleaded guilty to insider charges in February. Mr. Wigton and Mr. Tabor were accused of illegally reaping profits after Mr. Siegel passed the tips along to them.</p>
        <p>The defense offered several different arguments in court last week. Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Wigton's attorney, referred to the Government's motion to dismiss the indictment as a ''transparent, cynical evasion of defendant's speedy trial rights.'' Paul J. Curran, the former United States Attorney who is representing Mr. Freeman, said he will file a charge of Government misconduct over its disclosure of information from a grand jury investigation in open court while describing the new indictment. Mr. Giuliani dismissed the threat as ''frivolous.''</p>
        <p>The Government, on the other hand, revealed almost nothing of its evidence. But it did make clear that the new trial, whenever it opens, will be complex and is likely to hinge on arguments over just what was said to whom and when.</p>
        <p>''You don't have a body with bullet holes here,'' Mr. Arkin said. ''You have a crime of words.''</p>
