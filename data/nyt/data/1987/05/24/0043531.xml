        <p>LEAD: IMAGINE Alydar if there had been no Affirmed.</p>
        <p>IMAGINE Alydar if there had been no Affirmed.</p>
        <p>Alydar would have been the champion 2-year-old of 1977 and a winner in 10 of 12 career starts as he began to bid for the 1978 Triple Crown. The Calumet Farm colt would have won the Kentucky Derby by 1 1/4 lengths, the Preakness by 7 1/2 lengths, then wrapped up the Triple Crown with a 13 1/2-length triumph in the Belmont Stakes. He would have been acclaimed a superhorse, a worthy heir to Whirlaway and Citation, who had won Triple Crowns for Calumet 30 years earlier.</p>
        <p>There were more than 40,000 foals born the same year as Alydar, and it is the exceptional crop that yields a colt as good as he was. But Alydar's crop yielded two colts that good. So instead of becoming the 11th Triple Crown winner, he became the first and only horse to run second in all three races, losing to Affirmed each time and by a combined margin of less than two lengths.</p>
        <p>Instead of winning what would have been his in almost any other season, Alydar settled for the reflected glory of the colt who beat him eight of the 10 times they met. By the end of the rivalry, Alydar was as popular as his conqueror, but is remembered less as a great horse than as an embodiment of life's injustices.</p>
        <p>Now glory is reflecting on Alydar again as his quality shines through in a different way. In 13 days, Alysheba will try to add the Belmont to his Derby and Preakness victories and become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed. Alysheba is a son of Alydar, and just one race away from accomplishing what his father so richly deserved.</p>
        <p>Although it remains questionable whether Alysheba has the talent of either his sire or the 11 Triple Crown winners, even some of his harshest critics may be willing to overlook his shortcomings and root for him solely because he is a son of Alydar. Rarely has a pedigree had so many fans or seem to hold so much promise.</p>
        <p>Despite their close finishes on the race track, the battle for supremacy at stud between Affirmed and Alydar looked like a mismatch from the start. Alydar, retired to his birthplace at Calumet in Lexington, Ky., was expected to be a more successful sire than Affirmed - even though the two carried much of the same blood.</p>
        <p>Both colts descended from the same sire line, one which flowed from Eclipse, the 18th century foundation sire, through his dominant descendant Phalaris in the early years of this century and finally, in the spring of 1950, to a foal who would be named Native Dancer.</p>
        <p>Native Dancer may have been the unluckiest Triple Crown competitor outside of his grandson, Alydar. Bred and raced by Alfred G. Vanderbilt and named with his owner's usual flair, Native Dancer was a son of Polynesian and Geisha. The colt's racing career coincided with the early days of television, and his gray coat made him easy to spot on the early black-and white sets as he charged to victory in 21 of 22 career starts.</p>
        <p>He should never have lost, and his only defeat came in the 1953 Kentucky Derby. Roughed at the first turn and taken back, he missed catching Dark Star by just a head. The footnote to The Daily Racing Form chart of that race says that Native Dancer was ''probably best,'' the only instance of such editorializing in any Derby chart. Native Dancer came back to win the Preakness and Belmont, and was Horse of the Year as a 4-year-old, but his fans and owner would have traded that title for the Triple Crown he deserved.</p>
        <p>At stud, Native Dancer became perhaps the most important thoroughbred stallion since Phalaris. That honor is usually bestowed on Northern Dancer, the most expensive and internationally influential sire of the last two decades, but it was Native Dancer who sired Natalma, Northern Dancer's dam.</p>
        <p>In addition to being Northern Dancer's grandsire, Native Dancer began the most prominent sire line in current American racing. The key mating was the one that matched him with a modest daughter of Case Ace named Raise You. Her Native Dancer foal was sold as a yearling in 1962 for $39,000.</p>
        <p>The buyer was Louis Wolfson, who would later own Affirmed, and he named the colt Raise a Native. In 1963, the colt was the hottest 2-year-old in the country, winning all four of his starts and setting two track records, but he bowed a tendon and was retired.</p>
        <p>At stud, Raise a Native was brilliant as both a sire of runners and a sire of sires. He has fathered 71 stakes-winners, and is the sire or grandsire of such classic winners as Majestic Prince, Genuine Risk, Tank's Prospect and Conquistador Cielo. His other descendants include Exclusive Native, Mr. Prospector, Fappiano - and Affirmed and Alydar.</p>
        <p>Wolfson bred and raced Exclusive Native and in 1974 bred him to Won't Tell You, a daughter of Crafty Admiral. That same spring, Calumet Farm sent its top mare, Sweet Tooth, to Raise a Native. Both breeders kept the resulting foals. Wolfson's was Affirmed, Calumet's was Alydar.</p>
        <p>Alydar made a splash as a stallion from the start. His first crop included the nation's champion 2-year-old filly, Althea, and her closest rival, Miss Oceana, who later sold for a record $7 million as a broodmare prospect. Alydar's 20 other stakes winners include Turkoman and Saratoga Six, and he has sired four millionaires.</p>
        <p>Affirmed has sired no millionaires and his leading sons and daughters are such comparative mediocrities as An Empress, Claude Monet and Persevered.</p>
        <p>The difference between Affirmed and Alydar as stallion prospects was in what breeders call their ''bottom lines'' - the female side of their pedigrees. Alydar's dam, Sweet Tooth, came from one of Calumet's best families, and is also the dam of the outstanding fillies Our Mims and Sugar 'n' Spice. Affirmed's dam, Won't Tell You, comes from a far spottier line.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Alydar is only half the story of Alysheba's pedigree, and Alysheba's bottom line is far less imposing than his sire's.</p>
        <p>Alysheba was bred by Preston Madden, the heir to Hamburg Place, a historic nursery in Lexington, Ky. Madden's grandfather, John E. Madden, bred five Derby winners there in the first quarter of the century, including Sir Barton, who became the first Triple Crown winner in 1919.</p>
        <p>The farm's most famous occupant in later years was War Admiral, the son of Man o' War who won the 1937 Triple Crown. In 1955, Preston Madden bred a mare named Blinking Owl to War Admiral, who had been moved to Hamburg in his waning years. The resulting filly, Belthazar, was the last foal sired by War Admiral.</p>
        <p>Belthazar never made it to the races but produced 10 foals. Eight of them raced and won but none amounted to much on the track. One of these was Bel Sheba. She was sired by Lt. Stevens, a quick middle-distance horse and a grandson of Nasrullah, the sire of Bold Ruler. Bel Sheba raced in 1971 and 1972, winning five of 22 starts and earning $34,031. Her sole mention in the record books, until now, was for finishing third to Faithful Girl in the 1972 Adirondack Stakes at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>Retired to Hamburg Place, she was a steady producer. Her second foal, Port Master, won 11 races and more than $175,000. That made her subsequent foals more marketable, especially amid the breeding boom of the early 1980's. In 1982, a Graustark-Bel Sheba filly sold for $250,000. In 1983, an Alydar-Bel Sheba colt fetched $200,000, and in 1985, a second Alydar-Bel Sheba colt sold for $500,000.</p>
        <p>The first Alydar-Bel Sheba colt was named Titanic and ran like his namesake, winning just two of 11 starts in an injury-plagued career. The second Alydar-Bel Sheba colt, purchased by the Clarence Scharbauer family at the 1985 Keeneland select summer yearling sales, was Alysheba.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, the nation's leading trainer for the last three years, trained Titanic and came close to bidding on his full brother.</p>
        <p>''Titanic had talent and ran a couple of fast races, but his legs were awful,'' Lukas recalled. ''I remember seeing Alysheba, and he was a good-looking yearling, but I couldn't get Titanic out of my mind. I knew he was going to sell for at least half a million, so I passed. It's hard for me to think of a full brother to Titanic being a Triple Crown winner, but you never know in racing.''</p>
        <p>Alysheba will earn $5 million under a new bonus scheme if he wins the Belmont, and would be worth at least four times that much as a stallion prospect, being a Triple Crown-winning son of Alydar.</p>
        <p>Even if Alysheba loses the Belmont, he is likely to win a new $1 million bonus for compiling the best overall record in the Triple Crown series. That bonus would be almost $43,000 more than Alydar earned for winning 14 of 26 career starts and finishing second to Affirmed eight times.</p>
        <p>Their rivalry ended on a sour note. Alydar finished second to Affirmed an eighth time in the Travers but was placed first when Affirmed was diqualified for impeding him. No one was satisfied by the result and they never met again - at least on the track.</p>
        <p>Last year, Affirmed was moved from Spendthrift Farm to Calumet, and the two stallions are in adjoining stalls in the stud barn. On the track, it was Alydar who made Affirmed look all the better, but in the breeding shed the roles are reversed. The best advertisement for Affirmed these days is that he ran so close to the mighty Alydar.</p>
