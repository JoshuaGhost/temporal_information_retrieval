        <p>LEAD: LEONARD CONTARDO, a guidance counselor at Yardville Elementary School here and a New Jersey teacher for 30 years, believes that children go to school carrying ''more emotional baggage than ever before.''</p>
        <p>LEONARD CONTARDO, a guidance counselor at Yardville Elementary School here and a New Jersey teacher for 30 years, believes that children go to school carrying ''more emotional baggage than ever before.''</p>
        <p>As a result, he has concentrated on ways to help them lighten their load.</p>
        <p>The activities Mr. Contardo has helped to develop for his school and its district enrollment of 11,000 include students' interaction with local nursing-home patients, gardening on school grounds and a classroom curriculum dealing with student stress.</p>
        <p>He also has devised evening workshops on student stress for parents and helped the school district form crisis-response teams to detect and confront student problems.</p>
        <p>''Relationships are going haywire,'' Mr. Contardo said. ''Families are breaking up and working parents have less time for their children. Priorities are mixed up, with too much parental pressure put upon a child urging him to become a young adult in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Contardo and 21 other Hamilton Township teachers were among 1,583 New Jersey public-school teachers honored at Governor Kean's Convocation on Excellence in Teaching.</p>
        <p>Also at the gathering, held at Princeton University, were Dr. Saul Cooperman, the state's Commissioner of Education, and the United States Secretary of Education, William Bennett, the keynote speaker.</p>
        <p>The 1,583 teachers received certificates and the state awarded $1.583 million in $1,000 amounts to each teacher's school to pay for an educational activity or purchase.</p>
        <p>Gary T. Reece, director of special projects in the Department of Education's Division of Educational Programs, said that 168 of the state's 589 school districts had not participated in the voluntary recognition program, a concept established by law in 1985.</p>
        <p>The program is not without its critics. Some educators said that the selection process could have been fairer, and some suggested that the money could be used by school districts more effectively if awarded in a lump sum or given directly to teachers as merit pay.</p>
        <p>The honored teachers were nominated by colleagues or selected by nine-member panels representing each school, Mr. Reece said, with school boards and teachers' unions each appointing three panelists. Those six members then chose three more members for the panel from the community.</p>
        <p>To be selected, Mr. Reece said, a teacher must demonstrate use of effective instructional techniques, establish a productive classroom climate and rapport with students and create feelings of self-worth and love of learning.</p>
        <p>Elaine Szul, a second-grade teacher at Robinson Elementary School here for 14 years and an award winner, said:</p>
        <p>''The recognition gives you a real boost.''</p>
        <p>Miss Szul, who earned a master's degree in adult education from Rutgers University seven years ago and also teaches at the Hamilton Adult Education Center, established a project known as ''Robin'' in her school in 1980.</p>
        <p>Robin stands for Retired Older Buddy Is Needed. The program enlists 40 volunteer classroom aides 55 to 79 years old.</p>
        <p>Miss Szul said that the Hamilton School District had adopted the program and that it was also being conducted in five other districts.</p>
        <p>''The project opens up the school to the community,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Because Robinson pupils work on computers, the volunteer aides were given computer orientation, along with other preparation for helping children on an individual basis.</p>
        <p>Miss Szul said that Robin encouraged friendly relationships between the two age groups.</p>
        <p>Among the projects undertaken by Miss Szul was to explain to inquisitive children the meaning of recycling.</p>
        <p>''We recycled right here,'' she said. ''The pupils shredded newspapers and then let them soak overnight before pulverizing them into pulp in a food processor.</p>
        <p>''Next, they added starch and food coloring and spread the mixture on thin layers of screen to dry. We actually made thick cardboard-type paper.''</p>
        <p>Dr. William A. Rieck, principal of Nottingham High School here, said that the teacher-recognition concept was positive, but that the selection process should be restructured to make it equally meaningful for all districts.</p>
        <p>Currently, he said, teachers in small schools have a better chance of being cited.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bernard Novick, director of computer services and staff developments for the Woodbridge School District, said that $24,000 in 24 teacher awards would enable the district to purchase videotape recorders, computers, copying machines and other equipment.</p>
        <p>''We can get the equipment three years sooner than if funded through our budget,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Fanny D. Rittenberg Elementary School in Egg Harbor City, 15 miles from Atlantic City, the principal, Stephen Combs, said:</p>
        <p>''The recognition enhances teacher morale here.''</p>
        <p>Hal Lugerner, a seventh- and eighth-grade mathematics teacher, was Rittenberg's awards recipient. He asked that the money be used to buy computers and software for his department.</p>
        <p>John Velchick Jr., a band teacher for 74 fifth- and sixth-grade students at Veterans Memorial Elementary School in Brick Township, was honored for his individualized teaching of musical instruments.</p>
        <p>''Music is an aid to learning and develops a youngster's discipline by requiring practice, rehearsals and performances, which are important in today's society.'' Mr. Velchick said, ''It also helps a student learn math, reading and some history.''</p>
