        <p>LEAD: The worst forest fire in memory in China has turned south and is threatening a city of 20,000 people in Inner Mongolia, official press outlets said today.</p>
        <p>The worst forest fire in memory in China has turned south and is threatening a city of 20,000 people in Inner Mongolia, official press outlets said today.</p>
        <p>The New China News Agency said the western sector of the fire was approaching the town of Mangui on the edge of huge virgin forests.</p>
        <p>It said thousands of firefighters were hacking out a firebreak 75 miles long and 200 yards wide to stop the blaze from reaching Mangui, which is home to China's only reindeer farm and to a major reserve for rare wild animals.</p>
        <p>The fire has killed more than 200 people, made 50,000 homeless and devastated almost 1.5 million acres in the northeast province of Heilungkiang.</p>
        <p>Mangui is about 75 miles from the town of Uma on the Ergun He, a river that forms part of China's border with the Soviet Union. Forests near Uma are threatened by a fire that has been blazing for a month in the Soviet Union and has reached the Ergun He, People's Daily said today.</p>
        <p>It said that a strong wind could carry the fire across the Ergun He, which is 150 yards wide at that point.</p>
        <p>The People's Daily said the government of Inner Mongolia had sent thousands of people tofight the fire. The armed forces have sent almost 5,000 tons of supplies including 300 tons of food and 50,000 pairs of shoes.</p>
