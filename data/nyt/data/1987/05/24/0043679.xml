        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Goldberger's article on ''overdesign''  [ ''Design: The Risks of Razzle-Dazzle,'' April 12 ]  certainly zeros in on many legitimate and serious concerns regarding visual excess, but, at the same time, can be interpreted as sounding a counterproductive alarm to the architectural community.</p>
        <p>Creating ''signature'' buildings, ones that aspire to make prominent statements, is not a new phenomenon in New York. Some of our most affectionately regarded landmarks, including the Woolworth Building, Lever House, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building did not resemble - either in design or size -anything that preceded or surrounded them. It was the ambition to be different, within the confines of quality and good taste, that made these buildings possible.</p>
        <p>The effort to design prominent buildings should not be discouraged simply because some efforts are not as successful as we would like or hope for them to be. Nor should it prompt a call for ''background'' buildings, which would be tantamount to re-entering a period of boring sameness, which fortunately seems to be passing.</p>
        <p>That all buildings cannot make landmark archtectural statements is to be expected; that some may even go too far and commit a form of architectural hubris is to be lamented. But this should not be reason enough for serious architects to stop trying. JOHN BURGEE, F.A.I.A.  New York City  WOULD MARCEL BREUER APPROVE OF THE WHITNEY ADDITION?</p>
