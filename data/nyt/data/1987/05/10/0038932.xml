        <p>LEAD: THE football season ended several months ago, but for me it still lingers. Here is why. I am an avid New York Giant football fan. I have been one for many years and have witnessed many losing seasons. Despite their past ineptness, I still loved them.</p>
        <p>THE football season ended several months ago, but for me it still lingers. Here is why. I am an avid New York Giant football fan. I have been one for many years and have witnessed many losing seasons. Despite their past ineptness, I still loved them.</p>
        <p>But the Giants won the Super Bowl, you say. An impossible dream was finally realized, you say. So what do I have to complain about? Let me count the ways.</p>
        <p>Every football season, without fail, I would develop an irritable disposition and digestive system that would last for the duration of the season. These maladies miraculously disappeared once football ended. In fact, my stomach was the first to tell me that baseball was starting.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1986, a strange and extraordinary happening occurred. The Giants took the divisional title and had to win two playoff games to qualify for the Super Bowl. Was ''next year'' finally here?''</p>
        <p>I sweated out the two victories. Airline tickets to Pasadena? Not yet. I sweated out a lottery system whereby only a limited number of Super Bowl ticket requests were honored. Yes, I was picked for two tickets. The Post Office then managed to ''misplace'' them for several nervous hours, and I envisioned a mailman in my seats at the Rose Bowl. But the tickets finally got through to me.</p>
        <p>I sweated out a lanced cyst on my back and a torn retina simultaneously that had me in sick bed until four days before Super Bowl Sunday. ''But, Doc, I won't sit on my back and I can still see out of the other eye.''</p>
        <p>I sweated out a sudden change in work location. ''But Boss, why don't you wait until the Super Bowl is over?'' He did not.</p>
        <p>I even had to sweat out a ''Giant'' snowstorm that closed the airport and delayed my flight to California for several hours. Surmounting all this, I finally made it. Pasadena, I am here!</p>
        <p>Once in the land of the orange groves, the precious tickets never left my person. Even in the shower, the pieces of cardboard were never out of view. Since I had worked in the most crime-ridden areas of New York City, I knew from experience that the safest spot for the tickets would be in my wallet, placed in my front pants pocket, and covered with a handkerchief. I followed this sage advice daily. You knew that I knew that nothing was going to get between me and my tickets.</p>
        <p>The day of the big game arrived and, with the tickets securely tucked in my wallet (I checked them constantly), my wife and I left for the promised land.</p>
        <p>We got to the Rose Bowl early in the morning and participated in the pre-game festivities outside of the stadium. A parade of people with ''I NEED TICKETS'' signs affixed to various parts of their anatomies marched around me. Fat chance. I would never sell my treasured tickets for any price, no sir, no way, no how.</p>
        <p>The California sun soon reminded me that it was time for a cool drink. I approached a soda stand, ordered a drink, and I took out my wallet to pay for the drink, when, whoosh, it happened. The tickets that were protruding from the wallet were snatched. Do you hear me, gone! My stomach sank to my ankles.</p>
        <p>I caught a glimpse of the rascal who committed this dastardly deed disappearing into the crowd. Imagine, my enduring 25 years of dismal Giants football, traveling 3,000 miles, and climbing mountainous obstacles, only to see my dream vaporizing right before my eyes. Grim Reaper, where is thy sting?</p>
        <p>The Pasadena police escorted us around the Stadium, perhaps to find Mr. Pickpocket, but to no avail. ''Oh, Goniff, may my tickets bring you 25 years of misery just as I had suffered.''</p>
        <p>Good fortune smiled on me. I was able to tell my story to Jim Gleason, the Giants' box office director, who presented me with the last two tickets anyone in the world had to Super Bowl XXI. (He could not return me to my original seats because purchasing scalped tickets is legal in California).</p>
        <p>With the new tickets placed in my shoe, my wife and I raced as fast as our middle-aged legs could carry us into the stadium before another calamity could befall us. We made it.</p>
        <p>The day had a happy ending. I watched my beloved Giants win the Super Bowl, proving that a dream could be attained with patience and love.</p>
        <p>Later that night, a TV commentator announced that 69 pickpockets had been arrested at the game. I hope my man was not one of them. I have a date with him at next year's Super Bowl in San Diego. I can't wait to see him try picking my shoe.</p>
