        <p>From time to time, an article receives a particularly strong response. Whenever possible, we will print a large number of the letters it elicits.</p>
        <p>Last month, two pieces brought in a higher-than-average amount of mail. They were ''Feeling Poor on $600,000 a Year'' by Brooke Kroeger (April 26) and ''What Capital Inflow?'' a Business Forum piece by Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for Economic Affairs (April 12).</p>
        <p>CAPITAL INFLOWS  To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While the Federal Government is not the major culprit in our worsening economic situation, it certainly is blameworthy for shielding the public from the true magnitude of our nation's economic vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortner should have pointed out that, to a great extent, the result of the inflow of foreign goods is that we are buying relatively short-lived items, while the foreigners are using our dollars to purchase more permanent assets. We are, in effect, trading office buildings for VCR's.</p>
        <p>Precisely because foreigners have invested their trade surplus largely within the United States, we have not yet felt the full pain of our non-competitiveness. The Federal Government should, at minimum, be making sure that we, the consumers, industrialists and legislators, are fully aware of the harm we are inflicting on ourselves.
