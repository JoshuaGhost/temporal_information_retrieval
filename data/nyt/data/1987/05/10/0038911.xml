        <p>LEAD: IN the aftermath of South Africa's whites-only elections last week the anti-apartheid movement was looking, with some anxiety, for indications of how its struggle might continue, and what the Government's reactions might be.</p>
        <p>IN the aftermath of South Africa's whites-only elections last week the anti-apartheid movement was looking, with some anxiety, for indications of how its struggle might continue, and what the Government's reactions might be.</p>
        <p>In the elections, South Africa moved further to the right as President P.W. Botha's National Party widened its parliamentary majority, and the Conservative Party's gains made it the official opposition party, replacing the left-of-center Progressive Federal Party.</p>
        <p>Some anti-apartheid leaders felt the the first post-election sign of the Government's attitude toward the movement came as white votes were being counted early Thursday morning: two explosions devastated the headquarters of the 600,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in downtown Johannesburg. The building had become the focal point of black protest in the days before the elections. The building has been declared unsafe by the Johannesburg Fire Department and is likely to be condemned.</p>
        <p>Cosatu officials believe the blasts were part of an orchestrated attack by the authorities over the last few weeks. A Cosatu statement linked the explosions with police raids on Cosatu offices around the country, the police shooting of six striking transport workers last month, the total banning of Cosatu rallies and meetings and the arrest of hundreds of trade unionists in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''This is part of a co-ordinated campaign to break the power of the labor movement,'' a Cosatu statement said.</p>
        <p>The police have rebutted suggestions that they were responsible for the explosions. They countered by announcing that they had affidavits stating that people had been murdered in Cosatu House and were investigating whether the devices that caused the explosions, according to police the most powerful devices ever used in the Johannesburg area, were of Soviet origin.</p>
        <p>The anti-apartheid campaigner, the Rev. Allan Boesak had no doubt as to who was responsible for the explosions: ''What the Government does not realize is that this type of smear tactic against Cosatu is going to cause a backlash of anger much worse than anything they have seen yet.''</p>
        <p>There was some hope among anti-apartheid activists that the struggle might continue in the courts, and that the courts might become the key weapon in the movement's shrinking arsenal. The movement drew some encouragement from the Natal Supreme Court on Friday. The court overturned a state ban on foreign funding for the United Democratic Front, the country's biggest anti-apartheid grouping, which is heavily dependent on contributions from abroad.</p>
        <p>The ban had been announced by President Botha less than 24 hours after he had interpreted the election result as a mandate for tougher security measures and warned that he would not tolerate extra-parliamentary action or foreign funds earmarked for extra-parliamentary groups.</p>
        <p>The Natal bench of the Supreme Court, known as the ''rebel bench,'' because of its record for anti-Government rulings, has overturned a number of the Government's draconian emergency restrictions on the press and civil rights.</p>
        <p>Dr. Boesak does not think the court's anti-Government rulings will be enough.''It is good to have these things on record but we cannot go on fighting in the courts indefinitely,'' he said. ''For every ruling in our favor, the South African Government has a new law. Court action does not draw in the masses of the people. It is something happening in a remote courtroom out of the reach of the people. If you want the people to be involved you must have mass action.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Boesak said that the rising tide of black anger following the election result would manifest itself in more mass actions such as protest strikes and rallies. But there would also be more practical action and creative community-oriented nonviolent programs as part of a broader passive resistance campaign, he said. ''As far as blacks are concerned the white community has made a clear choice for apartheid and oppression.''</p>
        <p>Government-oriented analysts said Mr. Botha had won a mandate to move ahead with his reforms, which critics have dismissed as a facelift for apartheid. But independent analysts said that the emergence of the extreme right-wing Conservative Party as the official opposition in the white chamber of the segregated Parliament meant that Mr. Botha would have to be looking continually over his right shoulder.</p>
        <p>Other analysts said that parliamentary opposition to apartheid was now likely to center around the strong performance by three independent candidates who stood on a platform of faster racial reforms.</p>
        <p>But the veteran civil rights campaigner Helen Suzman, who retained her seat in Parliament with a reduced majority, rejected a call by Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu for the Progressives to quit Parliament in a gesture of protest.</p>
        <p>The message from the white electorate was clear: we are only prepared to contemplate important changes to the status quo if this is backed up by the military might and the will to survive of the National Party.</p>
