        <p>LEAD: MARC and Kiki Ellenby have seen the future and it is filled with carambolas, millions of pounds of them.</p>
        <p>MARC and Kiki Ellenby have seen the future and it is filled with carambolas, millions of pounds of them.</p>
        <p>Carambolas (pronounced car-am-BOH-las) are currently the most promising of dozens of exotic fruits grown by the Ellenbys and other farmers in Homestead, a town 40 miles south of Miami.</p>
        <p>The farmers are hoping to capitalize on the booming market for exotics by commercially producing fruits that are native to foreign soils. Some, like the carambola from Southeast Asia, the Agriculture Department prohibits from being imported. Others are being made hardier and tastier in America through cross-breeding and other techniques.</p>
        <p>Homestead's climate - hot and humid like the lowland tropics of Malaysia and Thailand - makes it unique: Carambolas and many other exotics will not grow anywhere else in the continental United States.</p>
        <p>''There are about 10 to 12 major growers of exotics here,'' said Bill Schaefer, director of marketing at J. R. Brooks &amp; Son Inc., the largest shipper of exotic fruits in southern Florida. He said the newness of some of the fruits made it impossible to tell how many were sold. ''So much of this is still a cottage industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Ellenbys, for example, do their farming on 50 acres with the help of only one full-time employee in addition to seasonal pickers. Many of the other growers work on plots of just three to five acres.</p>
        <p>Originally from Chicago, the Ellenbys moved to Homestead after Mr. Ellenby earned a master's degree in horticulture with a specialty in fruit crops from the University of Florida. They started growing carambolas in 1981. The juicy fruit, some tart and some sweet, look like small yellow footballs with five deep indentations in their sides; when sliced, they have a star shape. Last season, the Ellenbys produced about 54,000 pounds of carambolas, one-tenth of the total domestic crop. THE fruit is selling briskly now around the country and Mr. Ellenby predicted that overall production might rise to 15 million pounds in the next 10 years. But prices are volatile - ranging from 40 cents a pound to more than $1.50 - and as the market settles down, many growers who had hoped to hit it big might be disappointed. ''It's gravy,'' Mr. Ellenby said. ''But the gravy train won't last.'' To hedge their bets, the Ellenbys and other Florida growers are also producing lychees and longans, which have a wide layer of moist grape-like pulp between their outer shells and their large central seeds; atemoyas, which contain a creamy white pulp said to taste like a melange of strawberries, pineapples and coconuts, and black sapote, whose fudge-like flesh can be used as a stand-in for chocolate.</p>
        <p>''Florida has things we cannot grow in California,'' said Frieda Caplan, the founder and chief executive of Frieda's Finest/Produce Specialties Inc. in Los Angeles, the premier shipper of exotic produce in California.</p>
        <p>The Ellenbys will not say how much money the new fruits are bringing in, although Mrs. Ellenby concedes that ''the return on tropical fruits right now is amazing.''</p>
        <p>''Let's just say we're expanding quickly - maybe a little more quickly than we should be,'' her husband said.</p>
