        <p>THE CITY IS HOT, WITHERING HOT, loiter-in-air-conditioned-office-lobbies hot.</p>
        <p>That half-witted remark you made last month at a friend's swim club after a few gin and tonics - ''Why don't we all have dinner at my place on the 23d?'' - has returned to haunt you. Your place? With a living room the size of a subway token booth and an anemic air conditioner? And how will you find the time to assemble dinner for six, when you haven't even found five minutes to water your plants since Easter?</p>
        <p>One possible solution, of course, is organizing a get-together in a restaurant. This may sound extravagantly expensive, but the truth is you should not have to dip into the Christmas Club account to do it. Many informal restaurants around the country can accommodate a small group for a reasonable price. Included here is a small sampling of some of the restaurants around Manhattan that can handle a party of six or more diners for between $25 and $35 per person, including wine, but not tax and tip. (While some establishments have private dining rooms, small groups - say, under eight people - rarely require them, unless privacy is a concern.) All it takes is some advance planning to insure that all your needs are met - table location, menu, pacing, wine and so on.</p>
        <p>The goal in organizing a restaurant affair is to deinstitutionalize the proceedings as much as possible. Whether the invited are business associates or friends, they should feel that they are at your party - an event that in some way reflects your personal style - and not just out for another meal in a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Begin by sniffing out suitable locations ahead of time. More often than not, an ethnic restaurant will fit the bill. It may be an Italian trattoria that serves sprightly pastas and grilled vegetables or an Oriental restaurant - Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese -that offers an assortment of tasting plates, or perhaps a homey French bistro. This type of low-key restaurant is often happy to fill special requests, especially if given advance notice of a week or more.</p>
        <p>''We often have groups who are out for a special occasion,'' said Richard OKon, the maitre d'hotel at Le Madeleine, a cheerful bistro in the theater district. Mr. OKon explained the protocol for payment that is usually followed at Le Madeleine. The host presents his credit card to the manager before dinner, and a price is estimated so the card's credit can be checked. Then, near the end of the meal, the host quietly excuses himself and signs the bill.</p>
        <p>Another consideration is the menu. It is usually possible to prearrange a special multicourse meal with the restaurant, rather than have the guests take the time to order a la carte. Just deciding who wants what can be time-consuming and distracting. In addition, a preset menu gives you some control over the cost of the meal.</p>
        <p>AT THE RITZ CAFE, A CAVERNOUS CAJUN-Creole restaurant in a handsome Art Deco setting, the management has blank menu cards that can be inscribed for individual groups. At The Water Club, which offers panoramic views of the East River and Brooklyn, service captains will recite a preselected menu to the guests. ''The captain could offer, say, a selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts so diners have some choices,'' said Michael O'Keeffe, the owner.</p>
        <p>Preselecting a menu also allows you to add a personal touch to the event. On the other hand, if the restaurant is very inexpensive and offers a menu of broad appeal, a la carte may be the way to go.</p>
        <p>In either case, the host should choose wines in advance that complement the food. The restaurants listed here have an adequate selection in the $20-and-under range. A party of six will require between three and four bottles.</p>
        <p>The major advantage of entertaining in restaurants, of course, is that you, too, can unwind while playing host. Better yet, when the meal is over, there is no Everest of dirty dishes waiting for your assault.  CARIBE  117 Perry Street, at Greenwich  Street, 255-9191.</p>
        <p>This funky little Greenwich Village restaurant eatery festooned with palm trees and pulsing with reggae music offers several Caribbean and West Indian specialties at rock-bottom prices. In fact, you should probably go a la carte here. You could begin with thick black-bean soup ($1.75 a cup), and go on to oxtail stew. The soft, fibrous meat is delicious, and it comes with black beans, fried plantains, sauteed bananas, yams and rice, all for $6.95. Tropical fruits, cakes and ice creams (under $3) are offered for dessert. A rainbow of tropical drinks is served, as well as a range of bargain-priced Spanish wines.  Dinner; daily. Cash or personal checks only.  MERIDIES  87 Seventh Avenue South, at  Barrow Street , 243-8000.</p>
        <p>A table in the comfortable, fume-free outdoor cafe is what you want at this bright, friendly restaurant with an eclectic, well-honed menu. Terrific thin-crusted pizzas would get your party off to a rousing start ($7 to $8, depending on size). Brittle and sweet deep-fried soft-shell crabs ($16) are a good entree option, as is roasted Cornish hen stuffed with whole figs, pine nuts, orange zest and herbs ($16). You can wow the crowd with a chocolate-coated monolith of a cake called raspberry delight ($6 a slice). Try the dry and slightly acidic white Erbaluce di Caluso from Italy's Piedmont region ($16).  Lunch and dinner; daily. American Express.  PIG HEAVEN  1540 Second Avenue, at 80th  Street, 744-4887.</p>
        <p>Chinese restaurants are always fun for large groups, and this one, a reliably good spot with a tongue-in-cheek barnyard motif, is high on my list of recommendations. You can choose a complete dinner that includes six different appetizers, Peking duck for six, rice and dessert for about $25 a person. Dumplings - fried, boiled or Szechwan-style - are wonderfully executed here ($4.80 for a plate of eight); so, too, are the scallion pancakes ($3) and the fiery hacked chicken ($7.70). Frozen praline mousse is hardly a typical Oriental dessert, but it is a soothing finale to this aggressively seasoned meal.</p>
        <p>Chinese beer and a good selection of inexpensive white wines are available, although the management allows you to bring your own wine for special occasions. Ask for the big round table with a view of the animated glass-enclosed kitchen.  Lunch and dinner; daily. American Express, Diners Club.  THE RITZ CAFE  2 Park Avenue, at 32d Street,  684-2122.</p>
        <p>This spacious wood-paneled Cajun-Creole-style restaurant turns out a number of boldly seasoned dishes, with an emphasis on seafood. The dining room can accommodate large groups, and the breezy nature of the place is well suited to convivial gatherings. Palate-tingling seafood gumbo would be a good starter ($4.95); recommended entrees include Gulf shrimp with garlic, tasso ham and tomatoes over corn vermicelli ($15.95) and shrimp sauteed in beer ($16.95). You can cool off with some heady Jack Daniel's chocolate ice cream. There is an ample supply of good California wines under $20.  Lunch; Monday through Friday. Dinner; daily. All major credit cards.  SIDEWALKERS'  12 West 72d Street, 799-6070.</p>
        <p>The sweet-sounding thuds of hammers against crab shells echo off the walls of this sprawling, informal seafood house. All starched formality fades when guests don plastic bibs and hoist mugs of foamy beer.</p>
        <p>For about $32 per person you can arrange a meal that includes buckets of steamers and mussels, accompanied by two pitchers of beer, followed by unlimited amounts of steamed Maryland hard-shell crabs, either with all-bay seasoning or steamed with garlic (you can choose grilled chicken for the non-seafood eaters). A choice of chocolate truffle cake, cheesecake or pecan pie is suggested for dessert.</p>
        <p>Dinner; daily. All major credit cards.  TOMMY TANG'S  323 Greenwich Street, between  Duane and Reade Streets,  334-9190.</p>
        <p>This hip Thai restaurant in TriBeCa turns out some electrifying dishes; multicourse tasting menus for about $30 a person can be arranged for groups as small as six. You could begin with vibrant coconut-and-curry-coated chicken sate, followed by such first-rate Thai specials as chicken coconut soup, ginger-perfumed ''Tommy duck,'' pad Thai (pan-fried noodles) and fruit sorbets. Navarro Gewurztraminer ($16) is assertive enough for this gastronomic feast.  Lunch; Monday through Friday. Dinner; Monday through Saturday. All major credit cards.  UNION SQUARE CAFE  21 East 16th Street, 243-4020.</p>
        <p>Danny Meyer, the owner of this rustic Italian restaurant, responded to the challenge of creating a $30 preset menu with the following suggestions: risotto flavored with porcini mushrooms and lingonberries, followed by seared butterflied baby chicken with rosemary and an Alsatian potato tart; for dessert, individual hot chocolate souffles. He recommended a delightfully crisp 1985 Tocai Friulano, Ronco del Gnemiz from Colli Orientali del Friuli ($18) for a white wine; for a red, the soft and elegant 1979 Chianti Classico Riserva from Fattoria di Felsina ($18). Other prix fixe menus are available for $32 per person and up.</p>
        <p>If you want a convivial backslapping atmosphere, ask for the back room; for a quieter setting, reserve in front. The second seating, about 9 P.M., insures you a table for the night.  Lunch and dinner; Monday through Saturday. American Express, MasterCard, Visa.  THE WATER CLUB  500 East 30th Street, 683-3333.</p>
        <p>Waterside dining always seems to put groups in a buoyant mood, and this pretty restaurant on two barges in the East River is well equipped to handle all sorts of festive occasions. It costs a little more than most of the others on this list. When asked about entertaining a group, Michael O'Keeffe, the owner, suggested several special menus. One begins with marinated salmon paired with dill and sweet red onions, followed by linguine with clam sauce, then chicken breast stuffed with spinach and wild mushrooms, green salad and lemon and raspberry sherberts. (Total cost: $44 per person.) The restaurant has a long and varied wine list with some good inexpensive selections. Ask for a table near the windows in the main room.  Lunch; Monday through Friday. Dinner; daily. Brunch; Saturday and Sunday. All major credit cards.  BUKHARA  148 East 48th Street, 838-1811.</p>
        <p>Eating roasted meats with your hands and tearing off chunks of puffed hot bread for sopping up sauces will surely break down any social inhibitions among dinner partners at this handsome Indian-Pakistani-Afghan restaurant serving ''frontier-style'' food. Chicken Bukhara, a yogurt-marinated whole chicken infused with garlic and ginger, is a bracing dish that serves two for $26.50; grilled veal marinated in dark rum and yogurt and seasoned with cinnamon and cumin is another evocative delight ($14). Round out the meal with tandoori-baked breads and then zesty frozen orange cream served in an orange shell. The tab should come to about $20 per person. Indian beer ($4 to $6) is probably the best foil for these flavorful dishes.</p>
        <p>Lunch and dinner; daily. All major credit cards.  LE MADELEINE  403 West 43d Street, 246-2993.</p>
        <p>The leafy little glass-roofed garden room at this moderately priced French bistro is well suited to informal get-togethers. A three-course meal - beginning with a refreshing cucumber-avocado soup or garlic-perfumed moules mariniere, followed by grilled fish or chicken paillard and dessert - runs about $25. Count on approximately $14 for a good wine. To avoid the pretheater crunch, reserve a table for 8 P.M. or later.  Lunch and dinner; daily. American Express, MasterCard, Visa.  RESTAURANT-ENTERTAINING CHECKLIST</p>
        <p>The odds of success for your restaurant party vary according to the diligence of your preparation. Following is a (near) calamity-proof checklist.  *WHEN TO GO:</p>
        <p>Some restaurants experience an onslaught of diners at certain hours - those in the theater district or near a concert hall, for example, are often packed between 6 and 8 P.M., then empty out when performances begin. Others have a late crowd, or a hectic lunch. Work around this.</p>
        <p>If you have to be there for part of the busy period, ask for a table that is somewhat insulated from the clamor.  *PRIX FIXE OR A LA CARTE:</p>
        <p>This is a personal choice. By preselecting a menu for guests, you add a personal touch to the event, avoid the presentation of menus and prices and, at the same time, control the cost of the meal. You may wish to have a special menu written, omitting prices. If the restaurant has a particularly inviting budget-priced menu, however, it may be best to order a la carte.  *MENU SELECTION:</p>
        <p>Obviously you must choose dishes that have the greatest chance of pleasing everyone. Steer clear of tripe, sweetbreads and any creatures that inhabit murky swamps.  *WINE AND COCKTAILS:</p>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with the wine selection in advance and estimate how many bottles you will need. One bottle of wine yields five or six average-size glasses; for a party of six count on between three and four bottles for at least three glasses a person. If it is a bring-your-own situation, so much the better. But ask about corkage fees.  Cocktails should be offered before dinner.  *TABLE LOCATION AND SEATING ARRANGEMENTS:</p>
        <p>Do you want a festive, animated spot in the busiest part of the room, or a secluded corner? Do you wish to be near the music? Keep in mind potential distractions such as Arctic air-conditioning vents, harsh lighting, noise, smoke from other diners and swinging doors.</p>
        <p>Decide on the seating arrangement. If the group is larger than six, you may want place cards.  *PACING:</p>
        <p>Make sure the table you reserve is ready when your guests arrive (they should be discouraged from being fashionably late) and that it is yours for as long as you wish; this may require booking a second-seating reservation.</p>
        <p>Make clear to the manager that you desire a leisurely pace - you may even be able to work out a system for signaling when you are ready for the next course.  *SPECIAL REQUESTS:</p>
        <p>Inform the restaurant if you'd like special arrangements made, such as a birthday cake or champagne for a special business occasion.  *HANDLING THE BILL:</p>
        <p>Inquire about the preferred method of payment in advance. Guests should not see the bill.</p>
        <p>If the restaurant knows you, you may be able to have it sent. The majority, however, will have to work out an alternative, such as giving a credit card or check to the manager in advance, then signing it at the end of the meal. In a cash-only situation, partial advance payment may be required.  *TIPPING:</p>
        <p>If you are pleased with the service, a generous tip of 20 percent or more is in order.</p>
