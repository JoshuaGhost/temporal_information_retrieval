        <p>LEAD: The special courtroom arranged in the grand foyer of Lyons's Palace of Justice for the trial of Klaus Barbie makes clear that this is no routine affair.

        <p>The special courtroom arranged in the grand foyer of Lyons's Palace of Justice for the trial of Klaus Barbie makes clear that this is no routine affair. The French say it will probably be the last big war-criminal trial in the West, and many hope it will serve as a gripping history lesson for those too young to remember, those who have forgotten and those who never wanted to know.</p>
        <p>But the procedure is tedious and most faces are expressionless. Mr. Barbie himself listened attentively, for two days. He showed no sign of remorse, and then quit the trial arguing that he was an ''illegal hostage'' subject to a ''lynch atmosphere.'' The haunting drama is not here.</p>
        <p>It is in the absences, the many millions of absences of people who perished simply because of who they were, who their families were. The jury will judge Mr. Barbie on charges of crimes against humanity when he was an SS Obersturmfuhrer during the Nazi occupation of Lyons.</p>
        <p>There is no dock for those who did nothing, and no charges against them. But they are the ones who come to mind as the bailiff drones on. It is hard to realize now how much there was of nothing done, of passivity, which, as Michel Thomas says, was also a form of collaboration.</p>
        <p>Michel Thomas was born in Poland and grew up in France, where he joined the Resistance during the occupation. He was caught and held for deportation, but he managed to escape. When the Americans came, he joined the U.S. Army, eventually becoming a citizen. Now he says he feels himself ''totally American, constitutionally, for everything America stands for. If my country is wrong, I can get up and speak out.''</p>
        <p>Still, he thinks of the bits of paper that didn't arrive and the people who departed, to death. Once, in the camp at Les Milles near Aix-en-Provence, he watched the nightly train with its cargo for the gas chambers. A few people ran alongside, waving a paper.</p>
        <p>''The cattle cars were already sealed. But they had a note about a visa for a woman. They went from one car to another, and finally they found her. She was allowed out.'' Then the crowded train left, he says. Hitler's plan, Mr. Thomas points out, was to rid Germany and then ''his'' conquered Europe of Jews. The Nazi phrase was ''Judenrein,'' literally, cleansed of Jews. But the Nazis found there was nowhere to send the people.</p>
        <p>American and other officials from countries still neutral, when they could be reached, kept saying: ''You must wait until your number comes up on the quota. We can do nothing until it is your turn.''</p>
        <p>The British were very strict about how many might go to Palestine if they managed to flee German authority. The Swiss and others around the world were cautious and reluctant to admit people. There were only a few places and millions who needed refuge. ''They were sacrificed on the altar of the quota,'' Mr. Thomas says.</p>
        <p>So the Nazis turned to the ''final solution.'' As Mr. Thomas puts it, ''Since they couldn't throw the people out normally, they threw them out by the smokestack.''</p>
        <p>It does not diminish the guilt of the murderers and the torturers that there was so little hospitable compassion in the rest of the world, so much indifference. But it vastly diminished the number of survivors, of children who would be grandparents now, coming to the end of productive lives, of who knows what kind of geniuses, human beings, good or bad.</p>
        <p>There were no boat people, no refugee camps. To most, haven was denied. It is true that the details and the vast scope of barbarism were not widely known until Allied troops came upon the concentration and death camps.</p>
        <p>A young woman, telephoning to a radio call-in show in Lyons the day Mr. Barbie's trial opened, said she opposed going over all that because of one old man in the dock. ''Besides,'' she said, ''what about all the people who didn't do anything to help? The International Red Cross visited the camps and they knew what was going on and they didn't care. What about them?''</p>
        <p>That is nonsense. There were no Red Cross visits, no outside observers, no parcels. In a way, it is encouraging that postwar generations take it for granted that help and humanitarian attention are made available in times of great human distress. That was not the case under the Third Reich.</p>
        <p>But people did know about the deportations, about the persecutions, about the desperate search for refuge. Most knew and shrugged. What, they said, could they do? One purpose of Mr. Barbie's trial is to keep memory alive so the crimes may never be allowed to happen again. It should also serve as a warning against the horror of doing nothing.</p>
