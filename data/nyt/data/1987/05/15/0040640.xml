        <p>LEAD: A former United States Postal Service official has been charged with accepting bribes from the Wedtech Corporation and an internal investigation is examining the possibility that the Postal Service itself was cheated by the Bronx military contractor, the subject of other state and Federal inquiries.</p>
        <p>A former United States Postal Service official has been charged with accepting bribes from the Wedtech Corporation and an internal investigation is examining the possibility that the Postal Service itself was cheated by the Bronx military contractor, the subject of other state and Federal inquiries.</p>
        <p>In an indictment issued by a Federal grand jury in Baltimore, Jerrydoe E. Smith, described by a Postal Service spokesman as a $55,000-a-year ''contract specialist,'' was accused of conspiring to commit bribery in a ''corrupt agreement and understanding'' with Wedtech executives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Robert Schulman, did not return telephone calls to his Baltimore office this week. Allegations on $10,000 Bribes</p>
        <p>According to the charges against Mr. Smith, on April 26, 1985 and March 21, 1986, he accepted bribes of $10,000 each ''and other benefits'' from Wedtech executives in return for helping the company win two contracts, one for $5.7 million and the other for $2.9 million. The contracts were to produce ''general purpose mail containers,'' metal cages used to transport mail.</p>
        <p>Phil Nater, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service, an investigative agency, said today that Wedtech did not actually produce the containers awarded under the contracts. Instead, he said, the company ''subcontracted out virtually 100 percent of the order.''</p>
        <p>The implication, he added, is that Wedtech charged the Postal Service considerably more than the market price for the containers.</p>
        <p>Wedtech was also awarded the two contracts under a Postal Service program designed to assist businesses owned by members of minority groups. The first contract was awarded with no competitive bidding. The second contract was awarded after bidding against other minority-owned businesses, Mr. Nater said.</p>
        <p>It would appear to have been a violation of the regulations governing that program for Wedtech to then acquire the containers from a subcontractor and to resell them, rather than to manufacture the containers on its own, Mr. Nater said.</p>
        <p>The Postal Inspection Service, in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has begun an investigation relating to the Wedtech contracts and the Postal Service's procurement procedures.</p>
        <p>In a separate development, Newsday reported today that a special prosecutor had obtained records showing that Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d had personally intervened to help Wedtech obtain a $32 million Army contract in 1982, while he was White House counselor.</p>
        <p>The newspaper said it had learned about the records from unidentified ''Congressional and investigative sources.'' It said the information was turned over to James C. McKay, the prosecutor who is investigating links between Mr. Meese and Wedtech.</p>
        <p>Terry Eastland, Mr. Meese's spokesman, today dismissed the article as a ''vicious attack'' from unnamed sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meese has previously acknowledged that he instructed senior aides to intervene on behalf of Wedtech, but he said last month that he could not recall whether he had personally helped the company.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Mr. Meese invested about $60,000 with a financial consultant who worked for Wedtech.  ----  EX-OFFICIAL TELLS OF PRESSURE</p>
        <p>FRESNO, Calif., May 14 (AP) - The former head of the Small Business Administration says he was forced to resign because he ignored pressure from two White House aides to award the $32 million Army contract to Wedtech, The Fresno Bee reported today.</p>
        <p>The newspaper quoted the official, Michael Cardenas, as saying that he had testified before a Federal grand jury investigating Wedtech that his refusal ''played a very significant role in my departure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas identified the aides as Pierre Talenti and Henry Zuniga. Efforts to reach them were unsuccessful.</p>
