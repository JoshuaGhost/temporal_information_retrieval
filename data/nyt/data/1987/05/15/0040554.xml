        <p>LEAD: ALMOST all of his works have dropped into obscurity, but for a while the Brazilian-born Antonio Carlos Gomes was a leading Italian opera composer. Gomes first came to know the works of Bellini and Donizetti and Verdi as a student in Rio de Janeiro in the 1850's and 1860's. He began composing operas of his own, and the success of his ''Joana de Flandres'' in 1863 won the 27-year-old Gomes a grant, sponsored by the Brazilian Government, to study at the Milan Conservatory.</p>

        <p>ALMOST all of his works have dropped into obscurity, but for a while the Brazilian-born Antonio Carlos Gomes was a leading Italian opera composer. Gomes first came to know the works of Bellini and Donizetti and Verdi as a student in Rio de Janeiro in the 1850's and 1860's. He began composing operas of his own, and the success of his ''Joana de Flandres'' in 1863 won the 27-year-old Gomes a grant, sponsored by the Brazilian Government, to study at the Milan Conservatory. By 1870, he triumphed at La Scala with ''Il Guarany,'' which remains the composer's best-known work.</p>
        <p>Four years later, Gomes wrote ''Salvator Rosa.'' It had its premiere in Genoa but pretty much disappeared after that, to be heard only in excerpts. Fortunately, the Amato Opera, at 319 Bowery, has decided to stage a revival.</p>
        <p>The small company would hardly seem the right outfit to present this very grand, very 19th-century production. ''Salvator Rosa'' is based loosely on the brief political escapades of the 17th-century painter, a period when Rosa became involved in uprisings against the Spanish.</p>
        <p>In Gomes's story, the girl Rosa most admires turns out to be (who else?) Isabella, the daughter of the evil Duke. As the plot twists and turns, the fortunes of the Duke, Rosa, Isabella and the rebel leader Masaniello rise and fall several times before the work's tragic conclusion.</p>
        <p>The repeated-note flourish at the beginning of the overture sets the heroic scale for the four-act, three-and-a-half hour opera, but ''Salvator Rosa'' is filled with a rather individual style of lyric writing. Some well-conceived duets and trios help to sustain interest throughout.</p>
        <p>The Amato production, given in its matchbox of a theater, does Gomes good service, generally compensating for what cannot be provided in the way of big voices and fancy sets. Anthony Amato conducts the handful of winds and the creaky piano that make up what there is of an orchestra; Richard Cerullo has done magic with the sets, evoking a series of large-scale scenes on the very small stage.</p>
        <p>A different cast sings each performace. Sunday afternoon's version -which included some two dozen vocalists, several of whom flowed into the aisles when the stage was already packed - ranged from amateurish to adequate, but the leads held their own: Jay Emanuel Bahny, a bass, sang the Duke in appealingly resonant tones; James Landers, a tenor, made a convincing Rosa and Rebecca Seiglar, as Isabella, displayed a penetrating soprano.</p>
        <p>The opera will be repeated today and tomorrow at 7:30 P.M.; next Friday and May 23, also at 7:30 P.M., and on May 24 at 2:30 P.M.</p>
