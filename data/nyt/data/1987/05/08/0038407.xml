        <p>LEAD: Drunken-driving charges against Andrew P. O'Rourke Jr., the 31-year-old son of the Westchester County Eexecutive, were dismissed here today by Town Justice Robert Troup, who decided there was insufficient evidence.</p>
        <p>Drunken-driving charges against Andrew P. O'Rourke Jr., the 31-year-old son of the Westchester County Eexecutive, were dismissed here today by Town Justice Robert Troup, who decided there was insufficient evidence.</p>
        <p>State Trooper William Kelly testified that he found the defendant ''confused and incoherent'' at 9:30 P.M. last March 17 when he called at Mr. O'Rourke's home in Ossining, but said no tests for alcohol use had been taken at 7:30 P.M., the time of the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Rourke, a newscaster for a Westchester radio station, had stopped after his car struck that of Arthur Bergquist of Ossining, a computer programmer. Mr. O'Rourke then left, saying he was going to get help for possible injuries to a companion in the car.</p>
        <p>Justice Troup said there was not enough evidence to show that a crime had been committed. Mr. O'Rourke had a previous conviction for driving while intoxicated in 1980, which meant that he would have faced as much as four years in prison if convicted a second time within 10 years.</p>
