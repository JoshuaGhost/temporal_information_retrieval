        <p>LEAD: It was a perfect setting for a bit of old-fashioned politicking, but out among the throng at the annual Strawberry Festival here, Representative Lee H. Hamilton cut a somewhat aloof figure.</p>
        <p>It was a perfect setting for a bit of old-fashioned politicking, but out among the throng at the annual Strawberry Festival here, Representative Lee H. Hamilton cut a somewhat aloof figure.</p>
        <p>It was not that Mr. Hamilton, a Democrat who has represented the Ninth District for 23 years, is not popular; quite the contrary. Rather, it seems that people in this small southern Indiana town don't quite know what to say to him since he has become a political celebrity back in Washington as the leader of the House's special investigation of the Iran-contra arms affair.</p>
        <p>Throughout a long day in the district, whether shaking hands here or riding at the Memorial Day parade in Dillsboro, or greeting some local businessman along Main Street in Rising Sun, Mr. Hamilton was asked virtually nothing about how he viewed the Congressional investigation.</p>
        <p>Moreover, while plenty of people here have seen Mr. Hamilton presiding over the hearings in the last three weeks, few seemed to feel strongly that the investigation was worth all the trouble. Few Questions on Substance</p>
        <p>Even fewer could say with any certainty where Mr. Hamilton fits into the scheme of things, whether he favored or opposed the Reagan Administration's policies in Central America.</p>
        <p>''I get a lot of comments like, 'I've seen you on television and keep up the good work,' but you don't get a lot of questions on substance,'' Mr. Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>In fact, one of the few people here who pressed Mr. Hamilton on his views was not even a local resident. Rick Rodriquez, a native of Cuba who now lives in Orlando, Fla., was visiting in-laws in this dairy and fruit farming village of about 1,500 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriquez had not paid much attention to the hearings on television, he said. Still, he said, he had once visited Nicaragua, had seen the effect of the Sandinista revolution, and he wanted to know what the Congressman was doing to aid the rebels fight the spread of Communism. Intelligence Mission at Home</p>
        <p>Mr. Hamilton paused, said he was concerned about the issue, flashed an earnest smile and moved quickly to the next handshake.</p>
        <p>''He was friendly enough, but he didn't say what he would do, one way or the other,'' Mr. Rodriquez said.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Hamilton's cautious response may have cost him some support in south Florida, it is doubtful that it damanged his standing with his constituents here. In interviews around the district many residents, people Mr. Hamilton calls ''the real Middle America,'' appeared emotionally removed, even oblivious, to the political maelstrom on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Like most Congressman, Mr. Hamilton went back to his district over the Memorial Day recess to shake hands and mend fences. But such trips home are also intelligence missions, aimed at probing the mind and mood of the voters.</p>
        <p>Certainly one of the messages that Mr. Hamilton is likely to take back to Washington is that his constituents are rather bored with the stream of disclosures about the Administration's foreign policy machinations. That the people in Starlight and elsewhere in the district might feel that way is doubtlessly discouraging to Mr. Hamilton, who has spent much of his career on Capitol Hill building a reputation as one of the most influential members of Congress on foreign policy and intelligence issues. Deep Feeling of Trust</p>
        <p>But there is another, more reassuring message to be found here. For although Mr. Hamilton is probably somewhat more liberal on foreign policy issues than most of his constituents, he has clearly built a large reservoir of trust and faith that he will do the right thing.</p>
        <p>''You won't find a guy that's got more credibility than Lee,'' said John Huber, the owner of one of the biggest farms in the area. ''If you've got a little bit of a selfish interest to push, and it's not good for the country, he'll tell you up front. He's not like some of those politicans who will just nod in agreement, even if they don't agree with you.''</p>
        <p>Basically, the feeling in the district amounts to a belief that Mr. Hamilton will not use the hearings as a platform to bully the President. 'He's Very Patient'</p>
        <p>''He's on the panel for one reason, and that's to find the truth,'' Mr. Huber said.</p>
        <p>All together, Mr. Hamilton spent just 40 minutes at the Strawberry Festival, his third and final stop today before taking a flight back to Washington. Pausing on the way out to shake hands at the information booth, Daisy Book, who was selling raffle tickets for a quilt, yelled: ''You're doing a great job Congressman. I see you all the time on TV.''</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Mrs. Book said: ''I really think he's trying to be fair up there. He's very patient, and that's what counts.''</p>
        <p>That idea is repeated frequently in the Ninth District, the largest and least urban in the state. It stretches from Bloomington south through some of the nation's most abundant limestone quarries. Farther south, along the Ohio River, is poultry and cattle farming country.</p>
        <p>Until Mr. Hamilton was elected in 1964, in the Johnson landside that brought more than 40 other freshman House Democrats into office, this was staunchly Republican territory. Doubts About Reagan Policies</p>
        <p>A swing through the district makes it clear, however, that while there is still a strong strain of conservatism here, it is not an article of faith that President Reagan has performed admirably in the foreign policy arena.</p>
        <p>Strikingly, some of Mr. Hamilton's constituents, while maintaining that they were not deeply concerned about the Congressional investigations, expressed a deep abhorrence of the Adminstration's policies in Central America.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I don't think we have any business helping people who are definitely terrorists,'' said John Finn, a maintenance mechanic. ''I just think we're helping people who are on the wrong side of the fence.''</p>
        <p>Still, most of the people that Mr. Hamilton met here this weekend, his fourth visit to the district this month, seemed to share the view of Jim Koetter, a vice president of sales with a wholesale hardware company.</p>
        <p>''You listen to it for a while,'' Mr. Koetter said of the hearings, ''and after awhile, you just start ignoring it. Everybody here is a lot more concerned about the economy.''</p>
