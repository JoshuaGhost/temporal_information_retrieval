        <p>LEAD: If it was an attempt to assassinate John Gotti, it didn't work. The reputed Mafia chief was still alive, outside his Queens headquarters with several companions, after the noise that could have been a gunshot startled the neighborhood Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Gotti denied that he had been shot at, and there was no suspect for the police to arrest.</p>

        <p>If it was an attempt to assassinate John Gotti, it didn't work. The reputed Mafia chief was still alive, outside his Queens headquarters with several companions, after the noise that could have been a gunshot startled the neighborhood Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Gotti denied that he had been shot at, and there was no suspect for the police to arrest.</p>
        <p>But a trail of blood on a nearby street seemed to link the incident with the body of a man found in a Staten Island basement the next day, tied hand and foot with clothesline, encased in a body bag, with at least four bullet wounds in his face.</p>
        <p>The police gave this account, with the help of witnesses:</p>
        <p>The noise was heard at about 3:30 P.M as Mr. Gotti and his companions emerged from the Bergen Hunt and Fish Club in South Ozone Park. Men immediately began pouring out of the club, one carrying a baseball bat, and chased a lone man several blocks, then beat him and shoved him into a parked sedan. The car sped away, leaving behind it a 50-foot trail of blood.</p>
        <p>The body was found at 4:30 A.M. in the basement of Paul's Sweet Shoppe in the New Dorp section of Staten Island. The dead man was tentatively identified as a Yonkers resident with no known ties to organized crime; the owner of Paul's Sweet Shoppe was identified by the police as a captain in the Gambino crime family, the group Mr. Gotti is believed to head.</p>
        <p>Authorities said some factions of the Gambino family and other organized-crime groups held Mr. Gotti responsible for arranging the murder of his predecessor, Paul Castellano, in December 1985. However, the police said the attempt to kill Mr. Gotti - if that's what it was - was not carried out in gangland style.</p>
