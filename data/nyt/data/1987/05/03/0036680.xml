        <p>LEAD: With local government in turmoil in this small Vermont town, only one thing is certain: Job openings abound.</p>
        <p>With local government in turmoil in this small Vermont town, only one thing is certain: Job openings abound.</p>
        <p>All 10 members of the police department have quit, saying they could no longer work with their chief. The chief was suspended. The town manager, embroiled in the dispute, resigned; after he resigned, he says, he was dismissed. The manager's two aides left with him. Angry townspeople at a recent meeting suggested that the five members of the Board of Selectmen step down.</p>
        <p>At the center of the dispute is Police Chief W. James Lyons, 44 years old, who has logged 21 years as a police officer in Vermont, his last two and a half years spent as the chief in Milton. His detractors say Mr. Lyons, a large man with a loud voice, is vulgar and unprofessional. His supporters say he is old-fashioned, a bit rough around the edges, perhaps, but honest. Natives Versus Newcomers</p>
        <p>But many people here say that the drama being played out in this suburban community about 10 miles north of Burlington is a broader one, involving conflict between newcomers (some of the police and one faction of residents) and natives (the police chief, selectmen and other residents,) ''The problems in Milton could have erupted in any department,'' said State's Attorney Kevin G. Bradley of Chittenden County, who is investigating one of the many complaints involving the police. ''Why did Vesuvius erupt where it did?'' He said the pressure of high-income professionals moving into what ''has always been a real poor town'' created problems in the schools as well as town government. ''Nobody,'' he concluded, ''can make sense out of Milton.''</p>
        <p>The community is rife with rumors, name-calling, stories of clandestine meetings and secret deals. The selectmen now meet at the water plant instead of Town Hall when they want to assure privacy. At least six lawyers are involved in the dispute.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing has gotten completely out of control,'' said Silas Wells, a bus driver who is a native of Milton. ''I'm only sorry that the town of Milton is getting this kind of publicity.'' Even the Population Is Disputed</p>
        <p>The setting for all the intrigue is a town of 8,000 to 10,000 people (there is disagreement on this point as there is on just about everything else pertaining to Milton), dotted with tract houses, house trailers, shopping malls and an occasional farm.</p>
        <p>A sketchy outline of recent events includes these developments:</p>
        <p>In March the seven full-time police officers and three dispatchers filed a list of 36 grievances against Chief Lyons with the town manager, V. Michael Duffy. They alleged, among other things, that Chief Lyons was crude and unprofessional, that he insulted his officers, was insensitive to a victim of sexual assault, and that he disregarded proper police procedures. A leader of the anti-Lyons faction, Officer Edward Abel, 30, who moved to Vermont from Connecticut two and a half years ago, said of Chief Lyons: ''He is a 1950's cop in a 1980's environment.''</p>
        <p>Two days later, the entire department resigned. A police spokesman said that Mr. Duffy had told him that the selectmen had refused to act on the allegations and that Mr. Duffy encouraged the police to quit. Stuart King, Chairman of the Board of Selectmen, said the board did not even see the list of grievances until after the policemen resigned. Mr. Duffy said the police quit prematurely, because according to the town charter he had 10 days to act on the grievances. Sexual Harassment Is Charged</p>
        <p>The state authorities who read the grievances said there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the mass resignation, several women who work in the police department filed with the state charges of sexual harrassment against Chief Lyons. Mr. Duffy then suspended the chief with pay. Chief Lyons's lawyer, who contends that the charges are ''trumped up,'' has released sworn statements from two of the complainants, in which the women admitted that crude sexual comments were common among both male and female employees in the department.</p>
        <p>Late last month, Mr. Duffy, a part-time dairy farmer who is among the handful of Milton natives siding with the newcomers, resigned. He said he could no longer work with the selectmen, whom he called ''airheads'' and ''blockheads.'' He gave the board 30 days' notice. The selectmen, after an closed emergency session, told Mr. Duffy to leave his office immediately and threatened to call the police if he refused. His two aides quit with him. At a meeting the next night, about 60 irate residents confronted the selectmen, berating them for poor management and asking them to resign.</p>
        <p>Last week, an interim town manager was hired to take Mr. Duffy's place. An interim police chief has been on the job since late March, along with part-time and special police officers.</p>
        <p>On Friday the International Association of Chiefs of Police, hired by the selectmen to study the police department, briefed the board in a closed meeting. Mr. King said only that the consultants made some recommendations for resolving the problems with the police department.</p>
        <p>No one in town government seems to know what will happen next. One faction of townspeople, those who support the police and oppose the selectmen, are recruiting candidates to run for the three openings on the board in June. Mr. Duffy has expressed some interest in running.</p>
        <p>''We've got to clean house,'' said Roland E. Bluto Sr., a Milton resident since 1967. ''The people have got to come out and vote and let it be known how they feel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wells, the bus driver, predicted that the three incumbents up for re-election will win because they are supported by the ''silent majority'' of voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. King, whose term on the board expires in two years, is optimistic about the town's future. ''At this point,'' he said, ''there is no place to go but up.''</p>
