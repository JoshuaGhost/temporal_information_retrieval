        <p>LEAD: PRESIDENT REAGAN stood in the White House Rose Garden Friday and said he was optimistic about reducing economic tensions between Japan and the United States, but there were not many people in Washington who shared his characteristically rosy outlook.</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT REAGAN stood in the White House Rose Garden Friday and said he was optimistic about reducing economic tensions between Japan and the United States, but there were not many people in Washington who shared his characteristically rosy outlook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan praised his visitor, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, for having pledged to lower interest rates to help stabilize the dollar. He said he hoped to be able, in a couple of weeks, to lift sanctions against $300 million worth of Japanese products, as a result of better Japanese compliance with an antidumping agreement. And with a call for annual economic summit meetings between Japan and the United States, he warned yet again of the perils of protectionism.</p>
        <p>To many of those who are infuriated by the record United States trade deficit and, in particular, the record gap of $58.6 billion between Japanese goods imported into this country and American exports to Japan, the whole performance seemed far too pat. To them, it was another case of timid measures, sweeping pledges and broad smiles designed to obscure the failure to act on critical underlying problems.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Nakasone's announcement had been carefully coordinated with action by the American central bank, the Federal Reserve Board, to nudge American interest rates upward; major banks raised their prime lending rate to 8 percent. And there had been repeated low-level meetings on the sanctions issue. Even before Mr. Nakasone arrived in Washington, Senator John C. Danforth, the outspoken Missouri Republican, attacked the White House approach. ''Nakasone will come,'' he said, ''and he'll make all sorts of representations that a new leaf is about to be turned over. The President will embrace the prodigal; all will be forgiven, and nothing will happen. The time has come for action, not for more speeches or statements of good feeling.''</p>
        <p>The Japanese Prime Minister's plane landed in Washington shortly after the House of Representatives had given the most vivid demonstration so far of just how widely Senator Danforth's views are shared. Despite the threat of a Presidential veto, which turned into a promise when Mr. Reagan met Mr. Nakasone, the House adopted by a 218-214 vote an amendment requiring direct retaliation against countries like Japan that have allegedly shut out American products and services.</p>
        <p>It may well be that the amendment, sponsored by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, will be eliminated later in a Senate-House conference committee. The vote was very tight, and it was noticeable that members from California, which has important trading ties with Pacific nations, and from farm communities, which fear retaliation against their exports, tended to vote against the Gephardt measure. Nonetheless, its success probably guarantees that the final trade bill will be tougher than it otherwise would have been. Recent surveys have shown that a large majority of Americans favor protectionist measures and would be willing to pay higher prices to keep foreign goods out and thus save American manufacturing jobs. That puts Mr. Reagan in a bind. He is anxious to avoid a trade war with Japan, both because he believes in free trade and because of Japan's strategic importance, but he is being pushed in the opposite direction by domestic political currents. They can only get stronger as the 1988 Presidential campaign gets more and more active.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt, for one, is using trade as a principal weapon in his own campaign for the Democratic nomination, which centers on scoring an upset in the Iowa caucuses in February. He denies that his bill constitutes protectionism, arguing that only a credible threat will force the Japanese to open their markets and thus allow truly free trade between the two nations. His stance will put pressure on other candidates, especially fellow Democrats, to ''talk tough'' on the issue. Trade is the perfect issue for the party this time, several Democratic leaders have said recently, because it helps them to combat the damaging notion, widespread since the 1970's, that they always take the ''soft'' line in foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Even the interest-rate agreement, which succeeded last week in at least temporarily slowing the decline of the dollar against the yen and most other foreign currencies, and in calming the turmoil in the stock and bond markets, may be merely a short-term palliative. International economists believe, for the most part, that the dollar will remain vulnerable until Mr. Reagan acts to pare the huge American budget deficit and Mr. Nakasone stops relying on exports as virtually the sole means of promoting growth in the Japanese domestic economy.</p>
        <p>The Japanese Prime Minister has relatively little room to maneuver, with his popularity already at a 4 1/2-year low. Mr. Reagan seemingly remains as loath as ever to contemplate the prospect of a tax increase, which the Democrats on Capitol Hill consider an essential element of any concerted assault on the budget deficit, along with spending cuts.</p>
        <p>Another attempt to solve these problems, for which solutions were promised following big international meetings in New York in 1985, in Tokyo in 1986 and in Paris in February, will be made at the summit conference of the seven leading industrial powers in Venice in June. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, whose star has been in eclipse in Washington in recent months, hopes to further the plan that he announced in Tokyo last year for an international forum for decision making.</p>
        <p>But like all such schemes, it faces the immense obstacle of conflicting national interests - the very source of so much of the turbulence that has pushed international economic relations, once the dusty domain of academic specialists, to the center of world attention. Brave is the man or woman who would predict a breakthrough in June.</p>
