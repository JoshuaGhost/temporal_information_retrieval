        <p>LEAD: Apparently in a move to distance his Government from Libya, the Prime Minister of this South Pacific nation said today that two Libyans who arrived to open an embassy would be sent away.</p>
        <p>Apparently in a move to distance his Government from Libya, the Prime Minister of this South Pacific nation said today that two Libyans who arrived to open an embassy would be sent away.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Walter Lini said in an interview that because the Libyans had arrived unannounced they would not be permitted to open a Libyan mission or to see Government officials.</p>
        <p>The statement follows highly publicized allegations in Australia that Libya is turning Vanuatu into a base from which it would seek to destabilize the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>No evidence has been supplied to support the charge, but Australia's Foreign Minister flew to New Zealand several days ago to discuss the matter with New Zealand's Prime Minister. A Maverick in the Pacific</p>
        <p>The front-page headlines in Australia have shocked and angered this island group of 135,000 people. Vanuatu, which was known as the New Hebrides until it received independence from joint British-French control in 1980, is a maverick in the South Pacific. It is the only country in the region to belong to the movement professing nonalignment and the first Pacific island nation to give landing rights to Soviet fishermen.</p>
        <p>Libya had been expected to open an embassy, which it calls a people's bureau, after Vanuatu's Government reportedly made a statement that it was welcome to do so. The two Libyans apparently arrived to set up the embassy in this sleepy capital of about 15,000.</p>
        <p>But both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister said today in separate interviews that the Libyans arrived without formally requesting permission to open an embassy and without diplomatic accreditation. Because of this breach of protocol the Libyans will be sent away, Prime Minister Lini said in an interview in his home.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, Sela Molisa, said they were not sure what the Libyans had been doing in their 10 days in Port-Vila, or when they would leave. One of the Libyans, who would identify himself only as Marwan, refused to discuss the situation when reached by telephone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lini said that if the Libyans left the region and followed protocol, he expected that approval would be granted to open an embassy. A Surprise Move</p>
        <p>The statement was a surprise, although political analysts here had wondered about the delay in opening the embassy. The only countries that maintain missions in Port-Vila are Australia, Britain and France.</p>
        <p>Although the Libyans will not meet with Government officials, they have met several times with Barak Sope, the secretary general of the ruling party, Prime Minister Lini said. Mr. Sope appears to be the architect of the link with Libya.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister also made it clear that Vanuatu's relationship with Libya would continue. He said, for example, that he hoped to send some policemen to Libya for training.</p>
        <p>The interview was the first that the Prime Minister has given in Vanuatu since he suffered a stroke while visiting Washington in early February. He has remained closeted in his home since his return and has not seen diplomats, tribal chiefs or Government officials. In the interview, the Prime Minister spoke clearly but had difficulty using his right arm and walked very slowly.</p>
