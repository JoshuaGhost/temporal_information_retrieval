        <p>LEAD: A Federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that the Government must pay $700,000 to the family of a man who died in 1953 when the Army secretly used him in a chemical warfare experiment.</p>
        <p>A Federal judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that the Government must pay $700,000 to the family of a man who died in 1953 when the Army secretly used him in a chemical warfare experiment.</p>
        <p>The victim, Harold Blauer, was a civilian patient in a psychiatric institute who received injections of mescaline derivatives, without knowing that they were part of an experiment.</p>
        <p>Castigating the Government for covering up the facts for many years, Judge Constance Baker Motley of Federal District Court awarded the damages to Mr. Blauer's two daughters.</p>
        <p>''This court is faced with assessing a sad episode in the conduct of the United States Government and a personal tragedy for an unsuspecting victim and his family,'' Judge Motley said, adding that the Army had used Mr. Blauer as ''a guinea pig in an experiment.'' Reasons for Army's Cover-Up</p>
        <p>''Rather than admit its role in Blauer's death,'' the judge said, ''the Government covered up its involvement in the affair, thus this opinion is issued today rather than in the early 1950's when the death occurred.</p>
        <p>''The primary reason the Army covered up its involvement was to avoid embarrassment and adverse publicity.''</p>
        <p>In 1975, an unrelated Congressional inquiry uncovered documents about the experiment, and the Army informed Mr. Blauer's daughters about the true circumstances of his death.</p>
        <p>Judge Motley said that ''after this shocking revelation'' a lawsuit was filed by the older daughter, Elizabth Barrett of Manhattan. The case was bogged down by legal details for several years before resulting in a trial conducted by Judge Motley. Accountability of Government</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Ms. Barrett, Eugene R. Scheiman, said the judge's decision showed that the Government ''can be held accountable.'' Lawyers for the Government said they did not know whether the decision would be appealed.</p>
        <p>In the 109-page decision, the judge said that Mr. Blauer, who died at the age of 42, was a tennis professional who taught tennis at country clubs.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 5, 1952, he voluntarily entered the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan, suffering from depression after a divorce. He began improving, was to be released soon and was apprehensive about receiving the injections.</p>
        <p>Moments after receiving the fifth and final injection on Jan. 8, 1953, according to notes from the experiment, Mr. Blauer began sweating profusely and flailing his arms, his body stiffened and he frothed at the mouth. He lapsed into a coma and died in two hours.</p>
        <p>The institute informed the city's Medical Examiner of the death, but a doctor's written report said the injection was for ''diagnostic purposes'' and failed to mention the experiment.</p>
        <p>''The Army immediately began to take actions to make sure that its involvement with Blauer's death did not come to light,'' the judge said. She said the Army instructed doctors to discontinue the experiment until safety measures were in place.</p>
        <p>The institute notified Mr. Blauer's former wife, Amy, that he had died of ''an overdose of a drug.'' She sued the state, contending that the death was caused by negligence.</p>
        <p>In 1955, the state settled the case with Mrs. Blauer for $18,000, and the Government secretly contributed half the money on the condition that the Army's role be kept secret. Mrs. Blauer died in 1974.</p>
        <p>Judge Motley awarded $700,000 for the ''wrongful death'' of Mr. Blauer, $500,000 of it for his physical suffering and the rest for the losses suffered by his daughters.</p>
