        <p>LEAD: DANIEL MAIMIN, a student at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, always knew that one day he would be a developer. When he was 14 years old, though, he started working as a volunteer in a soup kitchen to meet a school requirement for social service. It changed his ideas about homeless and hungry people - and about developers.</p>
        <p>DANIEL MAIMIN, a student at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side, always knew that one day he would be a developer. When he was 14 years old, though, he started working as a volunteer in a soup kitchen to meet a school requirement for social service. It changed his ideas about homeless and hungry people - and about developers.</p>
        <p>''Building a building is like a monument to yourself,'' the 16-year-old said. ''I had a big ego then. I never really thought about the people.'' The people, he found, sometimes are left homeless because developers destroyed their houses. ''Now I'm interested in working with the city in developing low-income housing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Daniel is one of 30 or so Dalton students who have worked with the homeless and the hungry as part of a three-year-old program intended to make one principle clear: that people owe a debt to their communities. Increasingly, private and public schools nationwide are requiring students to do some kind of volunteer work. ''You're seeing a lot of this happen across the country,'' said Angela G. Vassos, who directs the community service program at the Fieldston School and shows other schools how to set up similar programs. ''It's probably the pendulum swinging back - the 'I' generation is catching up with us.''</p>
        <p>The impetus for these programs, she said, has come from adults who ''feel we've walked away from some kind of personal, individual commitment to anything.'' In her experience youngsters are always ready help others if they are encouraged to.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what we do to socialize them out of it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Humility and generosity were strikingly evident Monday afternoon among 13 soup kitchen volunteers from the Dalton and Brearley schools who had gathered to meet Pamela Green, executive director of the Food for Survival Foodbank in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Ms. Green, a Mississippi native and former banker, said she approached the meeting with some hesitation, not knowing what to expect from such economically privileged students. But after learning about their experiences she told them, ''I think what you have learned is something 90 percent of the adults in the country need to hear'' -that the homeless and hungry are people like the students, like their parents, like their grandparents. Perhaps because the students are well off, Ms. Green said, they are optimistic and unafraid, and that helps them cross seemingly impassable barriers to experiences that will forever influence them.</p>
        <p>The students' first encounters with soup kitchens were not easy. Some said they were afraid to smile because they might be seen as condescending. Some were reluctant to work in the soup kitchens to begin with because they felt out of place. John Dvi-Vardhana said he felt so uncomfortable when he started working at a Yorkville soup kitchen that ''my mother would have to force me out of bed.'' A conversation with a man who had been a hippie in the 1960's changed all that. The man was hungry, but he was also knowledgeable about things that interested John: he knew about rock music and had lived through an era that to John was only history. ''He saw the Doors,'' the teen-ager said. ''He was even at Woodstock.'' Eventually all the students found that they liked the people they were helping, enjoyed being with them.</p>
        <p>They started to look at their own lives differently as a consequence.</p>
        <p>Tracey Robert, for example, on a visit to a soup kitchen, saw a woman wearing an enormous Pavarotti button. When she learned the woman was wearing the button to keep her chest warm, ''I started crying,'' she said. Motivated by guilt, she joined an organization that works with the homeless. ''I was thinking that I was serving,'' she said. ''I never thought you could get so much from these people. It seems to me they're doing the service - I'm not.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Victor said of the soup kitchen where she works: ''I was talking to some of the guys who go there. They have funny things to say.</p>
        <p>Within 10 minutes we were singing a song from 'Animal House.' '' Before, she said, she had thought of such men as drunks. ''I really did stereotype,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When the stereotypes crumbled, so did the students' sense that they were different from the people who come to the soup kitchens. Daniel Maimin said one of the men who comes to the Yorkville soup kitchen is ''really smart and really nice; he came from a normal family, just like us.'' Besides, the teen-ager added: ''Thirty years from now I could be homeless and down on my luck. I'm helping them now, but for all I know someone could be helping me later.''</p>
        <p>Acts that once seemed insignificant have taken on new meaning for these students. ''You know how you open a big refrigerator and it's filled with food, and you say, oh, there's nothing to eat here?'' said Shane Harrison. ''I never do that anymore.''</p>
        <p>Volunteering has made them feel less guilty about their own good fortune, and more appreciative of it. It has even made them happier. ''I don't mean to brag,'' said John Dvi-Vardhana, ''but it makes you feel like a hero. It's nice.''</p>
        <p>Not always, though - not when you have to refuse someone's request for small things like extra sugar. ''You feel like such a bureaucrat,'' said Katie Friedman. ''I'm 16 years old.</p>
        <p>Who gave me the authority?'' She now sees her good fortune as a fluke, and her difference from the impoverished as chance rather than logic.</p>
        <p>''It's very random,'' she said. ''It could have been you.''</p>
        <p>The students' families were not always enthusiastic about their decision to work in soup kitchens when they could have fulfilled Dalton's requirement of 90 hours of service by tutoring or working in a hospital.</p>
        <p>Daniel said his mother was afraid the experience would be too disturbing.</p>
        <p>Fiona Oliphant said her grandmother worried: ''She believes they're all murderers,'' she said. Was the volunteering effective? Yes, say many students who have come to believe that citizen participation can solve community problems.</p>
        <p>But they are not sanguine about inspiring their peers to join them.</p>
        <p>Brigit Beyea told of trying to sell tickets for a dance to benefit the Coalition for the Homeless: ''It shocked me that people wouldn't buy them. I couldn't believe they wouldn't buy a ticket for $10. People were saying, 'No, I don't have it,' which isn't true.</p>
        <p>They had to go out and buy their sweaters and records and little accessories. The ratio of people who are helping to those who are not is disgusting.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Green, whose group has collected 10 million pounds of food from retailers and manufacturers and distributed it to organizations that feed the hungry, said emergency services like soup kitchens were never intended to be permanent. Volunteers never have enough money for food, she said, and they burn out, no matter how well intentioned. ''You're doing a finger-in-the-dike thing,'' she said. ''It is the government's responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Later, she marveled at the students' insight and openness, and suggested that they might find it easier than poorer teen-agers to get involved, in part because they are seeing lives so radically different from their own. ''If you are in a low-income neighborhood, getting involved is difficult,'' she said. ''It's threatening. You know how overwhelming it is.'' And she said of the volunteer work being done by the students she met:</p>
        <p>''I think it does change them. They've seen it as young people. It will always be with them. They may go to Wall Street, but they will always remember it.''</p>
