        <p>Seiji Ozawa is to raise his baton tomorrow to conduct the New Japan Philharmonic's 150th performance, and the sound the orchestra produces will travel for the first time across the Pacific into American homes on a digital signal path.</p>
        <p>The digital broadcast of the concert from Tokyo, to be broadcast over WNYC-FM and other public radio stations, will assure the listener that the music arrives on its long journey none the worse for wear.</p>
        <p>The transmission of music by radio over great distances has always posed major, and obstinate, technical difficulties. In physics, music exists as waves of energy. In conventional (or analog) transmission, the musical waves are sent out in their natural form, and are subject to distortion and interference. In digital transmission, by contrast, the wave forms are represented by a series of clearly defined numbers, which remain unaltered by any possible interference and are, therefore, undistorted. After reception, the signal is reconverted into the shape of the musical wave forms.</p>
        <p>Until quite recently, it has been impossible to achieve any acceptable degree of sonic fidelity in transoceanic broadcasts. The first attempt to relay a major musical event from Europe (a performance of ''Die Meistersinger'' under Arturo Toscanini's direction from the 1936 Salzburg Festival) could hardly be heard through the crackling static of shortwave reception. Even decades later, after the dawn of the space age, analog transmission, via satellite, was hampered by background noise and restrictions of dynamic range. Featured: Bruckner and Mozart</p>
        <p>Not until 1985 were these difficulties finally overcome when American and Austrian broadcasters staged the first intercontinental broadcast in digital sound, featuring the annual New Year's concert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. By keeping the signal digitally encoded during its big jump through outer space, the music was able to cross the ocean without any audible damage.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's broadcast applies the same principle of sending digital signals over the expanse of the Pacific - the longest distance ever covered in this musically superior manner.</p>
        <p>The two-and-a-half-hour broadcast begins at 8 P.M. WNYC (at 93.9 FM).</p>
