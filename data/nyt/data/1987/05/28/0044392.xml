        <p>LEAD: Few if any laws so passionately denounced by civil libertarians have passed Congress with such overwhelming bipartisan support as the 1984 ''preventive detention'' law that the Supreme Court upheld Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Few if any laws so passionately denounced by civil libertarians have passed Congress with such overwhelming bipartisan support as the 1984 ''preventive detention'' law that the Supreme Court upheld Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The lopsided votes for the law reflected more than simply strong popular demand for a tougher stance against crime, in particular against drug trafficking and violent crime by defendants out on bail.</p>
        <p>Equally important, perhaps, was a widespread sense that the longstanding system of money bail in the United States amounted to ''a sort of invisible system of preventive detention that raised questions about the honesty of the criminal justice system,'' as Terry Eastland, a Justice Department spokesman, put it today. Such questions, he said, might as well be brought out into the open.</p>
        <p>''Preventive detention'' means the jailing of criminal defendants before trial based on a judge's finding that, if released on bail, they would endanger ''the safety of any other person and the community,'' in the words of the Bail Reform Act of 1984. The Argument for Detention</p>
        <p>Before 1984, Federal law and the laws of most states required, at least in theory, that defendants be released before trial unless high bail was necessary to insure their appearance in court, except in cases in which capital punishment was a possibility.</p>
        <p>But supporters of the 1984 law, including some liberal Democrats as well as conservative Republicans and officials of the Reagan Administration, stressed the strong evidence that many trial judges were already detaining especially dangerous defendants by setting high bail under the guise of insuring their appearance.</p>
        <p>It would be more honest and more fair to poor defendants, the argument went, for judges to address the issue explicitly and openly. The 1984 law requires a hearing at which the defendant can seek to refute allegations that he would commit crimes if released, along with other procedural protections that included expedited appeal.</p>
        <p>Solicitor General Charles Fried, who argued the preventive detention case for the Government before the Supreme Court, said after the Court's decision that for these reasons, ''in the long run the law is a gain for liberties.'' Orwellian Regime Feared</p>
        <p>But opponents of preventive detention say the law has aggravated the crisis of overcrowded jails without demonstrably reducing crime, and has been abused to detain defendants charged with relatively minor crimes.</p>
        <p>Supporters do not deny that the law has put more people in jail, but they say this was one of its goals - to reduce crime by locking up dangerous people.</p>
        <p>Even some prosecutors, however, privately acknowledge a concern that, if abused, the preventive detention system could drift toward an Orwellian regime in which imprisonment based on accusation without conviction becomes the norm rather than the exception, and the hallowed rule that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty becomes an empty slogan.</p>
        <p>Some civil libertarians say this has already started to happen.</p>
        <p>Jerry Berman, chief legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said today: ''The sponsors of the law assured us that it would only apply to the violent. Now we see that's it's also being applied to the nonviolent. They also said it would replace money bail. Now we see that money bail is still going up and it's being added on. So we have the worst of both worlds.'' An Overhaul of Criminal Laws</p>
        <p>Mr. Eastland said, however, that there was little if any empirical evidence to support Mr. Berman's position that the law was being abused.</p>
        <p>In any event, the Supreme Court's 6-to-3 vote Tuesday to uphold the constitutionality of the law was a lot closer than the votes in Congress to adopt it.</p>
        <p>It passed as a key provision of a broad crime package generally regarded as the most far-reaching overhaul of Federal criminal laws in the nation's history. The votes on the package were 95 to 1 in the Senate and 406 to 16 in the House.</p>
        <p>But Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissentiing opinion Tuesday, recalled the words of Justice Robert H. Jackson in a 1950 opinion by himself alone: ''Imprisonment to protect society from predicted but nonconsummated offenses is. . .unprecedented in this country and. . . .is fraught with danger of excesses and injustice.''</p>
        <p>Overt preventive detention is unprecedented no longer. Whether it will lead to widespread injustice remains to be seen.</p>
