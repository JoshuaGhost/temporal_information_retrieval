        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Charles J. Morgan's claim that the Americans who fought for the Spanish Republic ''were pariahs then and poseurs now'' is based on a misunderstanding of the world in the 1930's and the role of commissars in Spain.</p>
        <p>The 1929 Depression caused serious deterioration in living standards of the people in Europe, many still suffering from the devastation of World War I. Their attempts to obtain a larger piece of the pie were opposed by the landowners and the wealthy, supported by the military and much of the clergy. They set up ''strong men'' who used deceit, violence and terror to keep the majority in their place. By 1935, some form of Fascism existed in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Rumania, Greece, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Portugal and Austria. In Spain, all parties, trade unions and organizations opposed to Fascism formed a popular front and won the elections in February 1936.</p>
        <p>The landowners, the wealthy, the military and much of the clergy, realizing they could no longer control Spain through elections, tried to overthrow the new Spanish Republic by a military uprising July 17. The people took up arms to defend their Government. Eight days later, the German Ambassador cabled Berlin that the uprising was doomed unless ''something out of the ordinary'' occurred. Something did. Francisco Franco was supplied with planes, artillery, tanks and troops by Hitler and Mussolini.</p>
        <p>At Britain's initiative, a nonintervention committee was set up Sept. 9, 1936, including Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union, all agreeing to send no arms or manpower to either side. All kept their word except Germany and Italy. On Oct. 7 at a meeting of the nonintervention committee, the Soviet delegate announced that if Germany and Italy did not stop, his country would feel free to aid the Republic. Germany and Italy did not stop, and Soviet planes and tanks, along with the 11th International Brigade, reached Madrid just in time to help prevent its capture.</p>
        <p>Some 40,000 volunteers, including 2,800 Americans, went to Spain to defend the Republican Government and to stop the advance of Fascism. I was among them, and having the good luck to survive the battles of Brunete, Quinto and Belchite, rose from third ammunition carrier for a machine gun to battalion commissar of the Lincoln battalion. I received strict orders to represent the Republican Government, and no political party, in the maintenance of the morale of my fellow soldiers.</p>
        <p>The decision to withdraw all the International Brigades in September 1938 was made by the Republican Government, and not by Stalin, in the hope that the League of Nations would force Hitler and Mussolini to withdraw their troops. It did not.</p>
        <p>We called ourselves the ''fighting anti-Fascists.'' We fought in the first war against Fascism. Six months after the Republic fell, the second war against Fascism began, in which American casualties exceeded one million. Would it not have been better to stop Hitler and Mussolini in Spain? CARL GEISER Smithtown, L.I., April 29, 1987 The writer is author of ''Prisoners of the Good Fight,'' and former commissar of the Lincoln and Mackenzie-Papineau battalions.</p>
