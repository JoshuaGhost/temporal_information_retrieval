        <p>LEAD: In a two-hour videotape played in court yesterday, Bernhard H. Goetz - appearing angry, sarcastic and full of rage - told New York City police detectives that he was a murderer in his heart.</p>
        <p>In a two-hour videotape played in court yesterday, Bernhard H. Goetz - appearing angry, sarcastic and full of rage - told New York City police detectives that he was a murderer in his heart.</p>
        <p>''They didn't die,'' Mr. Goetz said of the four youths he had shot on a Manhattan subway car on Dec. 22, 1984. ''Well, that's God's, that's what God has wanted evidently - if there is a God. But I, in my heart, was a murderer.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor told the jury when the trial began that Mr. Goetz's own words -particularly on the videotape, made after his surrender in Concord, N.H., eight days after the shootings - would be the most damaging evidence against him.</p>
        <p>The video image of Mr. Goetz on the screens placed before the jurors and the gallery was tired and even thinner and paler than he appeared in the courtroom. The jurors were instructed by the judge that, although they had been given typed transcripts of the tape, they should rely on their senses and not on the reading of the words. A Different Image</p>
        <p>The two-hour interview presented a far different image than the one heard earlier in the trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan when an audio tape was played of Mr. Goetz's questioning by the Concord police. In that interview, the defendant seemed turned inward, in an anguished self-appraisal of his actions and values.</p>
        <p>On the videotape, filmed in a Concord police station house interrogation room, Mr. Goetz's account of the subway incident was no less convoluted and complex. But it was far more belligerent and hostile toward his questioners and the ''sham'' legal bureacracy that he said they represented.</p>
        <p>''New York has never been concerned with right and wrong - it's concerned with the paper work, the formalities, the technicalities,'' Mr. Goetz said to his questioners at one point. ''I'm just sick, I am just sick of it.''</p>
        <p>''People are looking for a hero, or they're looking for a villain and neither is, nothing is the truth,'' he also said. ''What you have here is nothing more than a vicious rat -that's all it is. It's not Clint Eastwood.''</p>
        <p>As the tape began, Mr. Goetz, a self-employed 39-year-old electrical engineer from Manhattan, appeared withdrawn and haggard, hugging himself with both arms as he sat at a shiny, wood-grain interrogation table, a dull orange wall as the backdrop. He had already gone through his story twice before that day with the Concord police - the first time not recorded - and said he did not want to go through it again with people from New York. He said they would ''intellectualize'' his experience with rules and formalities and never be able to understand.</p>
        <p>As he was finally persuaded to speak, he became more animated, gesturing with his finger and his fist as he described the incident. Over and over, he repeated that he knew he had broken the rules and that he knew he would have to be judged for his actions, but that he simply did not care. 'I'm Not Going to Contest It'</p>
        <p>''I just want you to understand this -I am not going to plead guilty, I am not going to plead not guilty, I am, I'm not going to contest it,'' he said. ''You, New York City, who, the system that knows so much, and is so good, you decide what's, you decide what's right and wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goetz, who is charged with attempted murder, assault, illegal weapons possession and reckless endangerment, also complicated his defense -which has been based on a claim that the four youths were about to rob him - by stating flatly on the tape that whether the four youths he shot were really going to rob him or not did not matter.</p>
        <p>''The robbery has nothing to do with it,'' Mr. Goetz said. Rather, he said, it was the threat the youths presented. ''How can people like you be familiar with violence?'' he said. ''Have you been beaten into the ground?''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, the jury heard testimony from a passenger on the subway train who said he saw Mr. Goetz shoot one of the teen-agers from about two or three feet away. The passenger, Christopher Boucher, told the jury the youth was sitting on one of the subway benches, holding onto the bottom of it with both hands and looking frightened, when Mr. Goetz pulled the trigger. Woman Fell on Passenger</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher, a San Francisco resident who was in New York visiting a friend, said he did not see the first shots Mr. Goetz fired - which he said he first thought were firecrackers set off by the youths. A woman from across the subway aisle had fallen on him and a friend, Mr. Boucher testified.</p>
        <p>By the time they had helped her to her feet, he said, Mr. Goetz was standing in profile about 40 feet away at the far end of the car, a pistol in his hand pointed at a youth on the seat. ''Just a few seconds'' later, Mr. Boucher said, he saw Mr. Goetz shoot the youth.</p>
        <p>''Is there any doubt in your mind that you saw that person sitting in his seat when the gun was fired?'' said the prosecutor, Gregory L. Waples. ''No,'' Mr. Boucher replied. Mr. Boucher said he could only be sure that he heard three shots. The prosecution, based on Mr. Goetz's account, has said five shots were fired, with the fifth coming after three of the youths were hit and one shot had ricocheted in the subway car. Mr. Boucher said yesterday that he witnessed the final shot, which struck Darrell Cabey, who was the most severely injured of the four and is paralyzed below the rib cage. 'It Was Cold-Blooded'</p>
        <p>Mr. Goetz, on the videotape, also spoke of the so-called fifth shot described by Mr. Boucher, and used it in fact as a means of convincing his questioners that he was not just someone who had read the newspaper headlines and was making the story up.</p>
        <p>''It was all very cold-blooded, Miss, and this is going to offend everyone,'' he said, speaking to an assistant District Attorney, Susan Braver, with whom Mr. Goetz had the most heated exchanges on the tape. The youth, Mr. Goetz said, was hanging onto the strap pretending he was not with the others who had already fallen.</p>
        <p>''I was sure I had shot him - maybe I didn't,'' he said. ''He jerked his arm and I just, the trigger pulls on reflex.''</p>
        <p>The taped discussion also addressed a point stressed by Mr. Goetz's attorneys: that he felt threatened by all four youths as a group even though only two of them approached him and thus was justified in shooting all of them in self-defense. 'They Were All Together'</p>
        <p>''These two were moving around,'' he said of two of the teen-agers. ''They were paying attention to me I believe, but only in a, in a casual way.''</p>
        <p>''Did you feel threatened by them?'' he was asked.</p>
        <p>''They were all together,'' Mr. Goetz said in an anguished tone. ''They were all talking and joking with each other.''</p>
        <p>What emerged most clearly from the tape was the same ambiguity that has characterized the trial and the public debate that preceded it.</p>
        <p>''I know violence now from both sides,'' Mr. Goetz said. ''It's the worst thing in your life when you're on the losing side, and when you're on the winning side it makes you sick.''</p>
