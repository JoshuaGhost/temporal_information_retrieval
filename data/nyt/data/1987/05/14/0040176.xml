        <p>LEAD: Some unusual courses are being offered here for those who want to take an active part in preserving historical arts, artifacts and buildings.</p>
        <p>Some unusual courses are being offered here for those who want to take an active part in preserving historical arts, artifacts and buildings.</p>
        <p>At the North Bennet Street School, a trade school in the North End that offers courses to the public, students learn to handcraft furniture, musical instruments and jewelry through old-fashioned apprenticeship. The courses, which are offered year round, include bookbinding, locksmithing, cabinetry and violin making and restoration. Small class size allows students to work closely with instructors. Courses cost $500 to $700 a month.</p>
        <p>For more advanced students, the school offers a course in preservation carpentry. Through lectures, demonstrations and work on buildings constructed before this century, students learn preservation techniques for interiors and exteriors, and are taught how to restore structures with historical accuracy while using modern materials and techniques.</p>
        <p>The course in preservation carpentry lasts 36 weeks and meets daily from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. from September through May. The cost is $700 a month, and students provide their own tools. The school also offers introductory courses for students with no carpentry or preservation experience who want to prepare for this course. The school is at 39 North Bennet Street, Boston, Mass. 02113. Call 617-227-0155.</p>
        <p>For amateur preservationists who are interested in archeology, the Center for Archeological Studies at Boston University offers hands-on training at a historic house in Newbury, Mass. The instructors said that the 17th-century building, known as the Spencer-Pierce-Little House, is good for archeological fieldwork because it has changed little since being built.</p>
        <p>The goal of this course is to introduce students to archeological techniques while constructing a historical overview of the property, which once included barns and other buildings. The course will include fieldwork near the house, which is owned by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, as well as lectures and discussions on its history and architecture.</p>
        <p>Students can register for weekend workshops or for longer courses. The cost for a weekend is $150; one full week costs $300, two weeks $500 and four weeks $950. Classes start July 6 and the application deadline is May 25. For information, write Sara F. Mascia at the Center for Archeological Studies, Boston University, 232 Bay State Road, Boston, Mass. 02215, or call 617-353-3415.</p>
