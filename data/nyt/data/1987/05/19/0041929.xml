        <p>LEAD: The Limited, one of the nation's largest retailers of women's clothing, said today that it would enter the men's retail clothing market for the first time later this year.</p>
        <p>The Limited, one of the nation's largest retailers of women's clothing, said today that it would enter the men's retail clothing market for the first time later this year.</p>
        <p>At the company's annual stockholders meeting, Leslie H. Wexner, chairman, said the new line of men's apparel would be distributed through 15 Express Man stores, the first of which will open later this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wexner said in the past that he was not interested in selling men's clothing. But he said store managers had reported increasing business from men shopping in women's apparel stores for items for themselves, such as sweaters.</p>
        <p>''We changed our minds, and the change was driven by our customers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company's stores include The Limited, Limited Express, Lerners, Lane Bryant and Henri Bendel.</p>
