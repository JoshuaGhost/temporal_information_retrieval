        <p>LEAD: Dave Barr birdied four straight holes on the back nine, breaking a tie with the Masters champion, Larry Mize, and finished with a seven-under-par 65 today to win the Atlanta Golf Classic.</p>
        <p>Dave Barr birdied four straight holes on the back nine, breaking a tie with the Masters champion, Larry Mize, and finished with a seven-under-par 65 today to win the Atlanta Golf Classic.</p>
        <p>The four-shot victory was only the second triumph for Barr in 10 years on the PGA Tour. Barr, a Canadian, has won 10 titles in Canada.</p>
        <p>Barr, who finished with a 23-under-par 265 on the hilly, 7,007-yard Atlanta Country Club course, fell into a tie with Mize when he bogeyed the par-4 12th. Barr, who tied for second in the 1985 United States Open, then put together his birdie string that enabled him to pull away.</p>
        <p>He scored from 5 feet on No. 13, knocked in a 15-footer on the 14th, then had virtual tap-ins on Nos. 15 and 16, building a five-shot lead.</p>
        <p>The 35-year-old Barr started the final round one shot behind Bobby Wadkins, but drew even with a birdie on the first hole and had at least a share of the lead the rest of the way. Wadkins shot a 73 today to finish at 272.</p>
        <p>Mize, who finished with a 65 for 269, made the only serious challenge of the day. He made five birdies in a row, beginning at No. 7, but couldn't withstand Barr's late birdie run. Lanny Wadkins and Chip Beck tied for third at 270, with Wadkins shooting 66 and Beck 67. PICKUP GOLF FOLOS</p>
