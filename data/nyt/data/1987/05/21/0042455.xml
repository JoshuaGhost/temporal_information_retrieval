        <p>LEAD: Marine scientists and archeologists will explore the wreck of the Union warship Monitor next week to determine whether the Civil War ironclad can be raised, a Government agency said today.</p>
        <p>Marine scientists and archeologists will explore the wreck of the Union warship Monitor next week to determine whether the Civil War ironclad can be raised, a Government agency said today.</p>
        <p>The agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said it would conduct an unmanned deep-sea probe from Wednesday to June 9 that would examine the condition of the ship, which lies upside down in 220 feet of water off Cape Hatteras, N.C.</p>
        <p>The Deep Drone probe, equipped with special underwater cameras and sensors, will be operated from the Navy tugboat Apache and conduct four different studies of the Monitor, said Dr. Dail Brown, the head of the agency's expedition. He said the studies would determine how much and at what rate the ship is corroding; examine the surrounding area; construct a mosaic of the ship from the separate photographs taken, and examine the ship structurally.</p>
        <p>Roy Truman of Eastport International, the designer of the Deep Drone, said there were no plans to drill into or cut out a section of the vessel. Eastport will be assisting in the exploration. 'Expedition as a Prototype'</p>
        <p>Dane Konop, a spokesman for the national oceanic agency, said, ''We see the expedition as a prototype of the way in which marine archeology should be conducted.''</p>
        <p>The Monitor fought the Confederate's Merrimack, or Virginia, on March 9, 1862, off Virginia, in the first battle of ironclad ships. Neither ship was badly damaged in the four-hour fight. The Monitor sank on New Year's Eve of that year as it was being towed in a storm by the U.S.S. Rhode Island, killing four officers and 12 crew members.</p>
        <p>Capt. Leroy Clausen, the skipper of the Apache, said that if the ship is to be raised intact, an elaborate structure would have to be constructed beneath it.</p>
        <p>The total cost of the expedition to determine that possibility is estimated at $1.8 million, including the Navy's contribution of $1.3 million in services, according to Dr. Brown.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brown and others have said there was a need for a national policy to deal with salvageable shipwrecks in order to preserve them. Once a ship is raised, it can deteriorate rapidly, said Dr. Brown, so funds would have to be immediately available to preserve it.</p>
        <p>The Monitor was discovered in 1974 by a Duke University research team and was designated the nation's first National Marine Sanctuary in 1975.</p>
