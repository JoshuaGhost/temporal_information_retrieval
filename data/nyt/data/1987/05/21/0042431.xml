        <p>LEAD: There were no fireworks displays on Morningside Heights and not one toy cannon was shot off at Baker Field, but Tuesday was a day for small celebrations among those in the athletic community at Columbia.</p>
        <p>There were no fireworks displays on Morningside Heights and not one toy cannon was shot off at Baker Field, but Tuesday was a day for small celebrations among those in the athletic community at Columbia.</p>
        <p>On that day Gene Larkin reported to the Minnesota Twins and wore their uniform that night in Cleveland Stadium, available for a call to action against the Indians that never came.</p>
        <p>Larkin, a 24-year-old switch-hitter who batted .302 in 35 games with Portland of the Pacific Coast League this season, became the first player from Columbia in the major leagues since Lou Gehrig ended his career with the Yankees on May 2, 1939.</p>
        <p>Eddie Collins, the Hall of Fame second baseman from the class of 1907, and George (Columbia George) Smith, a pitcher from the class of 1915, were the only other Lions to perform in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>An all-America third baseman during his senior year in 1984, Larkin set five single-season and five career Columbia records, including a career average of .371 and 285 total bases. When he was drafted by Minnesota in June 1984, he was converted to first base because of his size - 6 feet 3 inches, 205 pounds.</p>
        <p>''I've become comfortable playing at first,'' Larkin said yesterday from Cleveland, where he was patiently awaiting his first swings at major league pitching. ''But I can also play third or the outfield, so versatility should add to my value. With the Twins, I expect to back up Kent Hrbek at first and do some pinch-hitting.</p>
        <p>''I've been able to hit over .300 in all four of my pro seasons. I'm a line-drive hitter who sprays the ball to all fields and I don't strike out much. I'd been expecting to spend the whole season in Triple-A ball at Portland, but this is an unexpected and big break for me. I hope I can make the most of it.''</p>
        <p>The Twins called up Larkin to fill a spot on the roster that opened when Tom Nieto, a catcher, suffered a broken hand Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty sure - I'm positive -I'm the first big leaguer from Columbia since Gehrig,'' he said. ''It'll be a tough act for me to follow, but it should help recruiting for the Columbia baseball team.''  SCOUTING</p>
