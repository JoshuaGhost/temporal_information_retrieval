        <p>LEAD: Radcliffe won the featured varsity eight-oared final of the Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges, overtaking Yale, then fighting off an Eli challenge at the finish of the 1,950-meter course.</p>
        <p>Radcliffe won the featured varsity eight-oared final of the Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges, overtaking Yale, then fighting off an Eli challenge at the finish of the 1,950-meter course.</p>
        <p>Conditions were ideal on Lake Waramaug, with a slight quartering wind relieving the heat for the afternoon finals. Radcliffe was favored for the varsity race on the basis of its undefeated Eastern record, its only loss coming April 25 in the Redwood Shores Regatta in California, when it lost to Washington by three seconds.</p>
        <p>Radcliffe's sternest challenge today was expected to be from Wisconsin, last year's winner. Instead, Yale moved out to a one-length lead in the first 500 meters, which Radcliffe retook by the 750-meter mark. At 1,000 meters, Wisconsin moved into second position, a half-length back of Radcliffe, but could not sustain its challenge. Yale retook second with 500 meters remaining, but could make no headway against Radcliffe, losing by 2.37 seconds. The winning time was 6 minutes 41.02 seconds.</p>
        <p>''It was a long time coming,'' said Liz O'Leary, Radcliffe's coach. ''Radcliffe last won in 1975.''</p>
        <p>O'Leary is coaching Radcliffe for the first time this year. As her oarswomen received their victory medals on the presentation dock, they raised their arms and shouted, ''Happy birthday, Liz,''</p>
        <p>Yale won the Charles Willig point trophy for regatta supremacy, based on its first-place showing in the novice eight's race and second-place finishes in the junior varsity and varsity contests. Brown won the junior varsity eight final and tied Princeton for second in the Willig trophy.</p>
