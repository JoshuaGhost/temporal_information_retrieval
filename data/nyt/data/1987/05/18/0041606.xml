        <p>LEAD: The South African Government has told the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia, author of the Sullivan Code of conduct for American companies operating here, that he must cancel a planned visit to the country on May 24.</p>
        <p>The South African Government has told the Rev. Leon Sullivan of Philadelphia, author of the Sullivan Code of conduct for American companies operating here, that he must cancel a planned visit to the country on May 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan, a Baptist minister who has played a pivotal role in persuading American companies here to confront apartheid laws, was planning a five-day visit to South Africa to assess progress towards ending apartheid.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Mr. Sullivan, who is black, set a May 31, 1987, deadline for the eradication of apartheid laws, failing which he would recommend that American companies cease operations in South Africa. More than 100 American companies have divested their South African holdings in the last two years. About 200 American companies still operate here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan said today that the Pretoria Government's decision to deny him a visa would make his task more difficult.</p>
