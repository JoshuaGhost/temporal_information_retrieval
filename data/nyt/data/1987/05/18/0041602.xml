        <p>LEAD: The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, retiring after 35 years as president of the University of Notre Dame, today bade farewell in a commencement ceremony with the words of Dostoyevsky: ''Let us agree that we shall never forget one another.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, retiring after 35 years as president of the University of Notre Dame, today bade farewell in a commencement ceremony with the words of Dostoyevsky: ''Let us agree that we shall never forget one another.''</p>
        <p>Father Hesburgh was awarded the Laetare Medal, given annually by the university to an American Roman Catholic of distinction.</p>
        <p>''We don't know where we're going from here,'' Father Hesburgh, former chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, said. ''But there are battles yet to be won for justice - mountains to be climbed to overcome prejudice, ignorance, even human stupidity.''</p>
        <p>Father Hesburgh changed the nature and mission of Catholic higher education. At Notre Dame, he broadened academic freedoms and turned over the governance of the 144-year-old institution to a lay board.</p>
        <p>Father Hesburgh, in demanding that academics take priority at Notre Dame, changed the image of the university into more than a football powerhouse. During his tenure, the university library has grown, from 250,000 books to 1.6 million; enrollment has doubled, and the faculty has tripled.</p>
        <p>Father Hesburgh, who is to turn 70 years old this month, headed the Civil Rights Commission under President Richard M. Nixon. But Mr. Nixon dismissed him in 1972 for criticizing the Government for ''backsliding'' on civil rights.</p>
        <p>President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Father Hesburgh the Medal of Freedom in 1964 and later offered him the job of director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which the priest declined.</p>
        <p>Receiving honorary degrees at the ceremony today were Dr. Norman E. Borlaug. the Nobel agricultural scientist; Rosalyn Carter; Coretta Scott King; David Rockefeller; the Rev. Martin Marty, a theologian; Timothy O'Meara, provost at Notre Dame; Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming; Yevgeny P. Velikhov, Soviet physicist; Archbishop Rembart Weakland of Milwaukee; the Rev. Richard V. Warner of Indiana, and Jean Wilkowski, a diplomat and consultant.</p>
        <p>Before the ceremony, many students cheered, ''We want Ted,'' and Father Hesburgh recieved four standing ovations at the ceremony.</p>
        <p>The keynote speaker, the president of Harvard University, Derek C. Bok, said Father Hesburgh had ''succeeded not only in strengthening Notre Dame academically but in teaching audiences everywhere about the values that matter in our society.'' Mr. Bok also was awarded an honorary degree.</p>
        <p>Father Hesburgh, a native of Syracuse, plans to travel around the country in a mobile home with another priest.</p>
