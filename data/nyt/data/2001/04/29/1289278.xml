        <p>United States national team crews won three races today in the first round of the Zurich Rowing World Cup, the first time the event has been staged in North America.</p>
        <p>Of the 14 events staged on Lake Mercer, the United States captured the men's eight and quadruple sculls and the women's lightweight double sculls. Twenty countries are competing this weekend in the first international rowing competition since last year's Sydney Games. Three more regattas, to be held in Seville, Spain; Vienna; and Munich, will determine the winners of the Zurich World Cup. The United States leads with 57 points, followed by Canada and Switzerland, tied for second with 23 each.</p>

        <p>United States national team crews won three races today in the first round of the Zurich Rowing World Cup, the first time the event has been staged in North America.</p>
        <p>Of the 14 events staged on Lake Mercer, the United States captured the men's eight and quadruple sculls and the women's lightweight double sculls. Twenty countries are competing this weekend in the first international rowing competition since last year's Sydney Games. Three more regattas, to be held in Seville, Spain; Vienna; and Munich, will determine the winners of the Zurich World Cup. The United States leads with 57 points, followed by Canada and Switzerland, tied for second with 23 each.</p>
        <p>Switzerland would have gained sole possession of second, but Xeno Mueller, its silver medalist men's single sculler at last year's Olympics, was upset by a newcomer from Norway, Olaf Tufte. Mueller finished second, with another newcomer, Matthew Wells of Britain, taking third.</p>
        <p>The United States eight, with three Sydney Olympians stabilizing the new members of the boat, dominated combined Canadian-French and Austrian-Danish eights, and two guest crews, Brown University and Dowling College of Long Island. Dowling raced as Yugoslavia, reflecting the makeup of its crew, which included seven Yugoslav oarsmen. Brown finished third in the eights race, 10.42 seconds, or two and a half boat lengths, behind the United States team, and 2.77 seconds behind the second-place Canadian-French crew.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, American collegiate crews added a sparkle to the finals.</p>
        <p>The men's heavyweight crews of Brown, Columbia and Northeastern all won dual races, and the lightweight men's crew of Yale captured not only the regatta trophy but also the Goldthwaite Cup -- emblematic of Big Three supremacy -- defeating Harvard and Princeton.</p>
        <p>The Yale lightweight men are undefeated and ranked No. 1 nationally going into their next race, the Eastern Sprint Championships on May 13 in Worcester, Mass.</p>
        <p>The standing of Brown's heavyweight men's varsity, the preseason favorite for Eastern supremacy, has slipped after a loss to Harvard two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''We changed the boat around for today, moving Matt Sazler up from the J.V. to stroke the varsity,'' said Scott Roop, Brown's coach.</p>
        <p>Fighting a fierce headwind, Sazler stroked his crew to the fastest time of the morning, 5 minutes 51.42 seconds, defeating Dowling and qualifying for the open eights final.</p>
        <p>Northeastern defeated Rutgers and Columbia defeated Boston University to round out the other men's heavyweight winners.</p>
