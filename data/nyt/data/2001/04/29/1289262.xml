        <p>Terror campaign of assassinations, carried out mostly by illegal paramilitary group, has debilitated labor union movement in Colombia and undermined efforts of labor leaders involved in peace talks with leftist rebels; labor leaders say at least 120 union workers were slain in 2000 and 69 in 1999; 35 have died since beginning of year; labor leaders accuse government of allowing problem to worsen by not effectively focusing on paramilitary gunmen and others who attack workers; say paramilitary groups, who have waged own war against rebel forces and anyone suspected of backing them, regard union organizers with their leftist leanings as akin to guerrillas; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Ricardo Orozco, vice president of the hospital workers' union, had pleaded with the government to provide him with bodyguards. For weeks, he had been certain that his name was on a list of potential targets for right-wing gunmen. But the government had determined that the chances of assassination were slim, and no bodyguards were assigned.</p>
        <p>So on a recent morning, Mr. Orozco was unprotected as a gunman attacked from behind and fired five bullets at him in Barranquilla in  northern Colombia. Mr. Orozco, 36, married and the father of a baby girl, was left dead on the street.</p>
        <p>That attack and dozens of others are part of a terror campaign, mostly carried out by an illegal paramilitary group, that has debilitated the union movement and undermined the efforts of labor leaders involved in peace talks with leftist rebels. Labor officials say that at least 120 union workers were slain last year and 69 in 1999. Thirty-five have died so far this year.</p>
        <p>Union leaders here and foreign labor organizations say the government could have prevented many slayings by expanding a program that assigns bodyguards and other protection. Along with groups like Amnesty International and the International Labor Organization, they  also argue that the government has allowed the problem to worsen by not effectively focusing on paramilitary gunmen and others who attack union workers.</p>
        <p>The paramilitary groups, who have waged their own war against the two largest rebel forces and anyone suspected of backing them, regard union organizers, with their leftist leanings and sometimes vocal criticism of the paramilitary movement, as akin to guerrillas, union leaders said.</p>
        <p>More than 1,200 unionists have been slain since 1991, most by paramilitary groups or assassins believed to have ties to the right, according to labor leaders and the National Union School, a research and educational center in Medellín.</p>
        <p>The problem, union officials say, is that the Interior Ministry's General Office for Human Rights, which is responsible for assessing the risks against union leaders and offering protection, operates on a meager budget that fell almost 30 percent, to $1.7 million this year from $2.4 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>The government failed to allocate even that money until the end of last month, said Labor Minister Angelino Garzón. ''They were practically paralyzed for lack of resources,'' said Mr. Garzón, who announced his resignation this month, possibly to run for president.</p>
        <p>After prodding by Mr. Garzón and labor leaders, an additional $1.3 million has been allocated for the Administrative Department of Security, which provides bodyguards and other protective measures. Labor leaders, however, say the resources are too scant to cover the dozens of endangered people.</p>
        <p>''The truth is that this entity doesn't work at all,'' said Alex Iván Ortiz, president of the union that represents electric utility workers, who remains unprotected despite requests for bodyguards. ''People are killed, people are threatened, and then nothing is ever done.''</p>
        <p>Interior Ministry officials disagree. Yet even they acknowledge shortcomings. One official explained that the lack of protection was ''because of the lack of resources.''</p>
        <p>Héctor Fajardo, secretary general of the Unified Confederation of Workers, is among the leaders who have received some protection. His office here is outfitted with rocket-proof windows. Bodyguards accompany him around the clock.</p>
        <p>''But when you look at all the union workers who have died, you see that this is not enough,'' Mr. Fajardo said. ''Yes, they protect my life. But meanwhile, the killers knock down 100. What we need is for the government to take the necessary measures.''</p>
        <p>His confederation, the largest in Colombia, represents 750,000 workers.</p>
        <p>Labor officials said the violence had severely damaged organizing, especially among unions in the fields of education, health care, petroleum and utilities.</p>
        <p>Unions consider themselves a legal and legitimate opposition to fiscally conservative governments that have been bent on privatizing industries and holding down labor spending. But many union leaders say their once fiery enthusiasm was inhibited with each slaying and threat.</p>
        <p>After a series of assassinations and threats, the oil workers' union in the Middle Magdalena River Valley has closed offices in isolated regions. A member of the union's Human Rights Commission, Ramón Rangel, said union workers were often ''found out by these groups, threatened, told to submit, not to do anything, say anything or else risk becoming military targets.''</p>
        <p>For those without bodyguards, Mr. Ortiz of the electric workers' union said, the key to survival is to take as many precautions as possible. Mr. Ortiz varies his routes to and from his office. He gave up jogging, and he rarely ventures out at night.</p>
        <p>''I'm terrified,'' he said recently before going to lunch. ''My wife is about to pick me up in a few minutes, and we might get killed out there. That is because I don't have protection.''</p>
        <p>The most active or vocal union leaders are those most at risk, particularly the leaders who are critical of regional governments or who advocate negotiated settlements with the insurgencies.</p>
        <p>The paramilitary group tied to most of the killings, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, has vehemently opposed talks with the rebels. In one of its more spectacular assassination attempts, the group tried to gun down the swaggering president of the Federation of State Workers, Wilson Borja, who had been encouraging talks.</p>
        <p>The shooting, in broad daylight in December on a street in Bogotá, left Mr. Borja alive but with three bullet wounds, two bodyguards wounded and a bystander dead. One gunman was killed.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said a police captain, who was later charged, had cooperated in the attack. The press also reported that investigators had found that in the days before the attack the gunman who was killed had called military and police officials on his cellular telephone and had received calls from them.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental reason why the union movement is being attacked is because of intolerance,'' Mr. Borja said by telephone from Cuba, where he is recuperating from his injuries. ''That intolerance means that everything smells like Communism, everything smells like a leftist, and what they want is to maintain the status quo.''</p>
