        <p>He has two Kentucky Derby victories in the past four years and, in the past three weeks, his horses have won the world's richest race, the Dubai World Cup, as well as the Santa Anita Derby. There is no doubt that this mixture of Triple Crown seasoning and a current hot streak makes Bob Baffert confident, even bold.</p>
        <p>But isn't it a little much to match a colt with just three career races against Monarchos, the impressive winner of the Florida Derby, and expect him to win, as Baffert expects Congaree to do on Saturday in the Wood Memorial? ''I'll be very disappointed if he doesn't win,'' Baffert said of the colt's first attempt against stakes company.</p>
        <p>In fact, the uninhibited white-haired trainer cannot help but look past the Wood to the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs. He already has the probable Kentucky Derby favorite, Point Given, who was a dazzling 5 1/2-length victor in last Saturday's Santa Anita Derby. Now with Congaree, he believes he will launch his strongest Triple Crown campaign in the Kentucky Derby since finishing first and third with Real Quiet and Indian Charlie in 1998.</p>
        <p>''I like my two,'' Baffert said. ''They're both big, brilliant and have pretty good heads on their shoulders. I think I have them ready, too, and that's all you can worry about this time of year.''</p>
        <p>Baffert insists it is experience not exuberance that informs his forecast. He has saddled nine horses in the Derby, and won it twice with Silver Charm and Real Quiet, both of whom then went on to win the Preakness before narrowly losing the Belmont Stakes and the Triple Crown. His sole Kentucky Derby entry last year, Captain Steve, finished eighth but developed over the summer to win five races, since capped by a victory last month in the $6 million Dubai World Cup.</p>
        <p>''Can you believe that Captain Steve makes more money than I do?'' Baffert said of the 4-year-old who has now earned more than $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>In Congaree, who will be part of a small field of five or six horses in the $750,000 Grade II race, the trainer has a promising colt but one very short on experience. Meanwhile, the favorite in the Wood, Monarchos, has proven his mettle by winning the three races he has entered this year, the last an emphatic 4 1/2-length victory in the Florida Derby that stamped him the best horse in the East.</p>
        <p>Congaree is a son of Arazi, who looked like racing's next superstar when he won the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile, but was nettled by injuries and finished eighth as the odds-on favorite the following year at the Derby. Baffert originally intended for Congaree to make his debut in Saratoga last summer, but the colt, after working steadily, came down with a cough and never raced. So last September, Baffert took him back to Del Mar, outside San Diego, for a six-furlong sprint. ''We thought he couldn't lose,'' Baffert said.</p>
        <p>He did, finishing sixth. Congaree is not the straightest-legged colt, and Baffert suspected something was bothering him. When X-rays discovered a small chip in his knee, Congaree had surgery and was laid up. He returned rested and running -- winning a mile maiden race by five lengths on Feb. 28, and followed that with an eight-length romp over an allowance field at a mile and a sixteenth.</p>
        <p>The trainer believes his colt is primed for a big race at the Wood's one-and-an-eighth-mile distance. On Monday, Congaree blitzed a six-furlong work at Santa Anita in 1:112/5 at Santa Anita, finishing the final eighth of a mile in a blistering 112/5 seconds. Baffert doesn't care if his colt lacks racing seasoning; he says he's got enough for both of them. And, in general, it is hard to question Baffert's judgment.</p>
        <p>For instance, after Point Given finished second by a nose to Macho Uno in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November, Baffert made the unusual decision to bring the horse right back in the Hollywood Futurity a few weeks later.</p>
        <p>The Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who will ride Point Given in the Kentucky Derby, explained Baffert's reasoning. ''He's a very, very big horse,'' Stevens said. ''Bob's made the comment that he's the biggest horse, heaviest horse that he's ever trained. And he felt like if we went for three months throughout the winter without racing and gave him that time off he was going to put on more weight.</p>
        <p>''And to then get him back to the level of fitness that he was before that -- there's always a risk of injury. And he feels that he's one of the best horses he's ever trained, if not the best horse that he's trained.''</p>
        <p>So Point Given ran in the Futurity and now he looks good enough to not just win the Derby but maybe capture the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>Baffert is just as confident that he is properly handling Congaree. In fact, his biggest problem has been trying to keep Congaree away from Point Given. Baffert said Congaree would have won against the same field that Point Given bulldozed in the Santa Anita Derby. But can Congaree beat Point Given?</p>
        <p>''If they're going to run into each other, let them do it for the big dough in Kentucky,'' Baffert said. ''I can wait until then to find out.''</p>
