        <p>LITTLE more than a decade ago, Japan still had the gleaming look of one of history's greatest economic success stories.</p>
        <p>Its economy, fully recovered from World War II, was propelling Asia so strongly that Japanese confidently described the region as a flock of geese following in its wake. For many people here, the question wasn't whether Japan would overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, but when.</p>
        <p>Rarely have the assumptions about a major nation's trajectory changed so drastically. Now, after 11 years of unrelenting decline, the desire by Japan's neighbors to follow its model have been replaced by dismay over its decay.</p>
        <p>Most tellingly, instead of talking about overtaking the United States, the Japanese now look over their shoulders in growing horror, wondering not if, but when their country will be eclipsed by China.</p>
        <p>It is worth recalling amid all of the gloom here that  conventional wisdom about Japan has often been dead wrong. In the late 1950's, no less an authority than Edwin O. Reischauer, America's pre-eminent postwar expert on Japan, is said to have worried that the country would never manage to export enough to develop its economy.</p>
        <p>Even now, many of Japan's economic assets remain surprisingly strong. Not the least of them are manufacturing skills that still lead the world in old industries, like cars, and in newer ones, from industrial robots to esoteric lasers. Then there is the country's sheer financial wealth. Japan alone accounts for about one-third of the world's savings, according to some estimates.</p>
        <p>''When we remember that Japan runs a large surplus in almost every tradable manufactured product, Japanese manufacturers pay some of the highest wages in the world, and nations with lower wage costs like the United States are rapidly increasing their trade deficits with Japan in high-tech goods, it is surely obvious that the Japanese economy is one of the strongest in the world, particularly judged by the yardsticks that matter to Japanese policy makers,'' wrote Eamonn Fingleton in a recent book about the global economy, ''In Praise of Hard Industries''(Houghton Mifflin, 1999). ''Japan's very different economy should be judged by Japanese objectives, and not Western ones.''</p>
        <p>Nowadays, though, such arguments run into serious objections from the Japanese themselves. Writing about this century in an essay in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Yukichi Amano, a prominent commentator, recently said, ''For good or ill, it will be a century in which what we built up with great pains in the 20th century will crumble away.''</p>
        <p>''The best measure of wealth is money and time,'' he added. ''Measured this way, today's Japanese are rich but too busy to have good time. But the 21st century will make them a poor people with plenty of free time.''</p>
        <p>If it seems rash to write Japan off altogether as a global economic leader, the trends that underpin such deep pessimism are unmistakably stark. For one, the most basic raw ingredient in economic power -- people themselves -- is probably Japan's biggest vulnerability.</p>
        <p>Its population is both aging and shrinking. The average household size in Tokyo is about to sink below two people, according to a recent report by the municipal government. The number of Japanese of working age peaked at 87 million in 1995, and is, according to official projections, set to decline to 55 million by 2050 --  a 37 percent drop.</p>
        <p>Add to that the strong rise of new and revived competitors almost everywhere the Japanese look, and it becomes easy to understand why many Japanese feel gloomy. The landscape runs from Asia's so-called tigers to India and especially China next door, and on to the United States, whose companies are making huge inroads in Japan's franchise in consumer electronics.</p>
        <p>JAPAN runs growing trade deficits with China, and now imports more from Asia than it does from North America and Europe combined. What is worse, other Asians are increasingly producing -- more cheaply and sometimes more quickly -- the kinds of sophisticated goods that made Japan rich. While those countries eat away at Japanese manufacturing from below, this country, at least since the advent of the personal computer, has had difficulty moving up the industrial food chain through the invention or perfection of new products. More often than not nowadays, it finds America's high-tech companies blocking its way.</p>
        <p>''Japan is already not a considered source for manufacturing when it comes to new product development for the New Economy,'' said Zachary Pessin, an associate with CTR Ventures, an investment firm that focuses on start-up companies here. ''It may be a producer of systems which can be used to service the New Economy, but wholesaling machinery is one step lower on the value chain than doing the actual production of new revolutionary products which create new markets and enjoy large margins.''</p>
        <p>As Japan prepares to choose its eighth prime minister since 1990, many people are concluding that the country's economic problems are at heart more political than the traditional hand-wringing over slow growth and low productivity suggest.</p>
        <p>A study of global trends released by the Central Intelligence Agency in December described Japan as a virtually rudderless nation tht ''will have difficulty maintaining its current position'' in the world.</p>
        <p>In fact, many experts in Japanese affairs are increasingly invoking a lack of democratic debate and alternatives as the country's principal source of weakness. The situation is best captured by the fact that the Liberal Democratic Party has been in power almost without interruption since 1955.</p>
        <p>''EVEN now, with a prime minister whose popularity rating is at a historic low, and with the Liberal Democrats attracting only about 20 percent voter support, few Japanese are clamoring for change and strong rivals for the Liberal Democrats have yet to emerge.</p>
        <p>Japan is a virtual one-party state, and it is the only industrialized economy that you can say that about,'' said Richard Katz, an economist and author of ''Japan, the System that Soured''(M. E. Sharpe, 1998). ''People are always expecting the very people who wrecked the economy to fix it. Rather than the fluid change that comes with alternation, problems build up for a long time until there is a wholesale change. It works, but it works differently.''</p>
