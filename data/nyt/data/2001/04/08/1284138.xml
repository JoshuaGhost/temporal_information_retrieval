        <p>A MODERN-DAY spy plane has little in common with an early 19th century schooner. One soars thousands of feet in the air, the other floats at sea level. One is stacked with technological gizmos, the other uses nothing more sophisticated than a compass and telescope.</p>
        <p>But both illustrate just how cloudy the law can become when international boundaries are crossed.</p>
        <p>When the Chinese refused last week to release a spy plane that landed on their territory, some international lawyers began studying a United States Supreme Court case from 1812 about a French schooner.</p>
        <p>The ship was not involved in spying, and its crew was never detained. But the schooner case helped solidify the principle -- well before airplanes arrived on the scene -- that ships forced to dock in another country because of a storm or distress remain the sovereign property of the country that operates them. The court held that the United States could not seize the French ship, though two American citizens claimed it was their property, not Napoleon's.</p>
        <p>''A public vessel of war of a foreign sovereign at peace with the United States coming into our ports, and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, is exempt from the jurisdiction of our country,'' the court found.</p>
        <p>United States officials made a similar claim of sovereign immunity after the Navy's EP-3E surveillance aircraft collided with a Chinese fighter jet and made an emergency landing at a Chinese military base on Hainan Island. The Chinese mocked the argument. ''If this plane is sovereign American territory, how did it land in China?'' asked Zhu Bangzao, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry.</p>
        <p>The collision occurred well outside of Chinese territory, strengthening the American claim. A country's territorial waters extend 12 miles from its shoreline, a provision of the Law of the Sea treaty that both the United States and China comply with. An ''exclusive economic zone'' can extend another 188 miles, though ships and planes from other nations can use that area freely.</p>
        <p>''A coastal nation cannot unduly restrict or impede the exercise of freedoms of navigation in, and overflight of, the exclusive economic zone,'' says the operations handbook produced by the United States Naval War College.</p>
        <p>The dispute became thornier, however, because the Chinese blamed the Navy plane for causing the accident. The Chinese also maintained that the spy plane did not request permission to land but swooped down onto the Chinese runway. It did not help matters that the plane was involved in surveillance, which is legal in international airspace but still controversial to the country spied on.</p>
        <p>In the end, legal experts say, the Chinese detention of the 24 crew members and search of the plane was rooted more in opportunity than international law. ''It would require a great deal of self-control for the Chinese to keep their mitts off this plane no matter what the law says,'' said Ruth G. Wedgwood, an international law professor at Yale.</p>
        <p>The United States has experienced such temptation itself in the cold war. In 1976, American officials throughly inspected a Soviet MIG-25 fighter jet that was flown by a defecting pilot to Japan. The Soviets demanded the jet back, and the United States eventually complied, sending it back in parts.</p>
        <p>As with most international disputes, this one is not likely to be decided by a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which the United States participates in only when it suits its purposes. ''Like most legal questions involving nations, this will be resolved politically,'' said Ralph G. Steinhardt, a law professor at George Washington University.</p>
