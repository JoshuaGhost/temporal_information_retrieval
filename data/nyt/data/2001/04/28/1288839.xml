        <p>The man who has been described by Hale House as chairman of its board, Tyrone D. Taborn, said yesterday that he had never actually served as chairman of the troubled Harlem charity.</p>
        <p>Hale House, however, has listed Mr. Taborn as its chairman since 1998 and said this week that he had resigned. Yesterday, the charity provided a transcript of Mr. Taborn's remarks at its June 2000 gala fund-raising dinner as well as pages from the dinner programs of June 1999 and June 2000 with statements by Mr. Taborn. In each case, he was identified as chairman.</p>

        <p>The man who has been described by Hale House as chairman of its board, Tyrone D. Taborn, said yesterday that he had never actually served as chairman of the troubled Harlem charity.</p>
        <p>Hale House, however, has listed Mr. Taborn as its chairman since 1998 and said this week that he had resigned. Yesterday, the charity provided a transcript of Mr. Taborn's remarks at its June 2000 gala fund-raising dinner as well as pages from the dinner programs of June 1999 and June 2000 with statements by Mr. Taborn. In each case, he was identified as chairman.</p>
        <p>But in a letter Monday to Dr. Lorraine E. Hale, the president of Hale House, Mr. Taborn said he had agreed several years ago to assume the role of chairman if the board of directors elected him to that post. ''No such meeting or election has ever taken place; therefore, I have never been elected chairman of the board nor have I entered into that position,'' wrote Mr. Taborn, who is chairman of Career Communications Group, a Baltimore publishing house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taborn, 42, made the letter public yesterday through a spokeswoman, Peggy Berk. She said he had learned only recently that Hale House had described him as its chairman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berk acknowledged that Mr. Taborn had also participated in a recent meeting at Hale House that occurred after newspaper articles began raising questions about charity's financial management. But she said he had gone to the meeting as a major donor to Hale House, not as the charity's chairman. Mr. Taborn declined to comment.</p>
