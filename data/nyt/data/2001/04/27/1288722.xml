        <p>The police may have improperly obtained the confession of a man charged in the killing of five workers at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens last year, raising the possibility that the confession will not be allowed as evidence in the man's murder trial, according to court documents filed by the defense.</p>
        <p>Legal experts and lawyers familiar with the evidence against the man, John B. Taylor, said the problem could complicate what had seemed to be a straightforward case and make it more difficult for prosecutors to persuade a jury to sentence Mr. Taylor to death. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, had been under great pressure from some of the relatives of the victims to seek the most severe punishment against Mr. Taylor, 36, especially after the other man accused in the massacre was sentenced in February to life in prison with no chance of parole.</p>

        <p>The police may have improperly obtained the confession of a man charged in the killing of five workers at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens last year, raising the possibility that the confession will not be allowed as evidence in the man's murder trial, according to court documents filed by the defense.</p>
        <p>Legal experts and lawyers familiar with the evidence against the man, John B. Taylor, said the problem could complicate what had seemed to be a straightforward case and make it more difficult for prosecutors to persuade a jury to sentence Mr. Taylor to death. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, had been under great pressure from some of the relatives of the victims to seek the most severe punishment against Mr. Taylor, 36, especially after the other man accused in the massacre was sentenced in February to life in prison with no chance of parole.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the police acted properly in obtaining a series of self-incriminating statements from Mr. Taylor, and other legal experts said there is a strong case against Mr. Taylor even without the confession. However, these experts said, if a judge ruled that Mr. Taylor's rights were violated when he made the statements, that could pose a problem at sentencing. Without the ironclad evidence of a confession, lingering doubts could nudge a jury away from imposing the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The confession has become an issue because Mr. Taylor made the statements without a lawyer present, even though a lawyer was representing him on a previous robbery case. That was a violation of Mr. Taylor's state and federal constitutional rights and makes the confession invalid, according to papers filed in court by Mr. Taylor's lawyer, John Youngblood, of the Capital Defender Office.</p>
        <p>''Once you have a lawyer, there is a requirement that you can't play games any more,'' said Edward A. McDonald, a criminal defense lawyer in Manhattan. He referred to several cases in New York in which judges have determined that confessions were not admissible because they were obtained from suspects who were questioned without representation and had lawyers on previous cases.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Taylor waived his right to a lawyer and ''wouldn't shut up'' about how he and the other defendant, Craig Godineaux, bound and gagged seven Wendy's employees and then shot each of them point blank, killing five and leaving two for dead. And because of the publicity surrounding the case, detectives, who located Mr. Taylor at his sister-in-law's house on Long Island two days after the crime last May 24 -- and were celebrated for their handy police work -- ''crossed every t and dotted every i,'' said Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brown.</p>
        <p>''All of the rights to which the defendant is entitled under the law were scrupulously observed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Youngblood declined to comment on the confession.</p>
        <p>Justice Steven W. Fisher will ultimately decide, at a hearing before the trial, whether Mr. Taylor's self-incriminating statements to the police should be thrown out, as Mr. Youngblood has argued. The trial is expected to begin later this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Godineaux, 31, was spared the possibility of the death penalty when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in February to life in prison with no chance of parole. He gave a harrowing statement in court that portrayed Mr. Taylor as the mastermind behind the massacre.</p>
        <p>The crime and the confession received extensive publicity, with Mr. Taylor's detailed statements about the killings displayed prominently in newspapers. Mr. Taylor gave a series of statements to the police, starting during his ride in a police car from his sister-in-law's home in Brentwood on Long Island, where he was arrested, and continuing with his hourlong videotaped confession, made at midnight in an interview room at the 111th precinct station house in Bayside, Queens.</p>
        <p>In the first statement, according to what prosecutors said during Mr. Taylor's arraignment last July, he told detectives, ''please get Craig. He's at SC&amp;R right now,'' referring to the Jamaica clothing store where the two men both worked as security guards.</p>
        <p>''He is security just like me at 165 and Jamaica Avenue, you know, the Coliseum,'' Mr. Taylor continued. ''Detectives, please, if you guys don't get Craig, he's definitely going to kill me, because I was the only one who saw him shoot those people in Wendy's. Look, detective, I know all about my rights, and it is me that's going to make this right because this was just supposed to be a robbery.''</p>
        <p>In the second statement, according to the arraignment minutes, Mr. Taylor told detectives that he did not want his lawyer on the prior robbery case, Pamela Jordan of Queens Law Associates, to represent him, and ''expressed that he was not happy with her and also advised that he did not wish to have any attorney represent him.''</p>
        <p>''I don't need a lawyer. I just want to tell you what happened to make this right,'' Mr. Taylor was quoted as telling the detectives.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan said she had represented Mr. Godineaux, but could not comment on the Wendy's case. In later statements, Mr. Taylor admitted to shooting one of the dead victims, while Mr. Godineaux admitted to shooting three and wounding two. Prosecutors charged Mr. Taylor earlier this month with the murder of the fifth victim, Anita C. Smith. Arraignment on that charge is scheduled for May 4.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor's confession is only one of many pieces of evidence against him, including identification of his weapon, eyewitness accounts from the two people who survived the massacre and a motive -- he had been fired from the Wendy's -- and is not seen as crucial to his conviction.</p>
        <p>And in the penalty phase, factors other than investigative tactics are more important, said Gerald L. Shargel, a Manhattan lawyer who successfully defended a capital punishment case. He said that on a jury, ''the collective mindset against imposing the death penalty usually comes from the social and family history of the defendant,'' not questions about investigative tactics, unless they are extreme.</p>
        <p>However, he added, ''Confession is always a big deal.''</p>
