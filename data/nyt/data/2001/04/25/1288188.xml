        <p>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has received an additional 90 days to divest himself of millions of dollars in investments that pose a potential conflict of interest, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld, who as chief executive of two corporations built a fortune valued at $50 million to $210 million, failed to meet an April 20 deadline to divest a vast array of stocks, partnerships and other holdings, as he agreed to do when he took office in January.</p>

        <p>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld has received an additional 90 days to divest himself of millions of dollars in investments that pose a potential conflict of interest, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld, who as chief executive of two corporations built a fortune valued at $50 million to $210 million, failed to meet an April 20 deadline to divest a vast array of stocks, partnerships and other holdings, as he agreed to do when he took office in January.</p>
        <p>At his request, however, the Office of Government Ethics, which oversees potential conflicts among public officials, granted him an extension, a spokesman for the office said today.  Because so many companies do business with the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld must dispose of a significant portion of his portfolio.</p>
        <p>Like several other Bush administration officials, Mr. Rumsfeld had to sell stocks and other holdings at a time when the stock market was slumping. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, the former chief executive of Alcoa Inc., announced last month that he would sell stocks and options in Alcoa that were valued at $100 million at the end of last year. A spokeswoman said the divestitures would take several more weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld's case is even more complicated because nearly half of his fortune -- $22 million to $99 million, according to his financial disclosure record -- consists of complex private investment partnerships that cannot be easily liquidated, including venture capital funds that invest in health care, energy, Internet and biotechnology companies in the United States and Asia.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, said today that Mr. Rumsfeld had completed the sale of his stocks shortly after being sworn in, but that the partnerships were proving difficult to sell.</p>
        <p>''There are several of the non-public holdings, despite his efforts and that of his financial advisers and his attorneys, have not found a buyer in that 90 days,'' Admiral Quigley said, referring to the first deadline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld's financial disclosure form showed that his largest investment in a limited partnership -- from $5 million to $25 million -- is in Deerfield Partners in New York. Other investments include Cerberus Institution Partners in New York, the Maverick Fund U.S.A. in Dallas and two separate R. Chaney &amp; Partner funds in Houston -- each worth  $1 million to $5 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld's agreement with the Office of Government Ethics detailed the stocks he was required to sell -- from Abbott Labs to Xcel Energy Inc. But the portions of the agreement detailing his partnerships have not been made public.</p>
        <p>''These are not publicly traded interests and there is no public market for them,'' Admiral Quigley said. ''It is a private market. And so you are largely at the mercy of a private entity to come in and make a bid.''</p>
