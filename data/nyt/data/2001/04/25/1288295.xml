        <p>A judge has ordered the city of Meriden, Conn., to refund $15.6 million to two power companies, saying it overtaxed them for nine years. Judge Thomas A. Bishop of State Superior Court ruled in favor of the companies, Yankee Gas Services and Connecticut Light and Power Company, on Friday. Meriden's city manager, Roger Kemp, said city leaders would  meet today to consider whether to appeal. If the decision stands, the city may have to issue a bond to pay the refund, Mr. Kemp said, which he said would limit future spending. Judge Bishop's decision criticized the city's appraisal method as inconsistent and called its tax appeals process inadequate.</p>
