        <p>Letter from Michael McGuffin (American Herbal Products Assn) challenges study that found no convincing proof to support use of St John's wort for treating depression</p>

        <p>The director of the study that evaluated St. John's wort asserts that there is no convincing proof to support the botanical's use for any type of depression, though he acknowledges that other studies say it works  (news article, April 18).

        <p>The study's director dismisses as coincidental the finding that more patients taking St. John's wort recovered fully from major depression than those receiving placebos. In fact, this further suggests St. John's wort's value and cries out for further scientific evaluation.</p>
