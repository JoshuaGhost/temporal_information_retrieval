        <p>April has been busy -- and expensive -- for Laurence Graff. Despite the softening economy, he just opened a Manhattan branch of his international jewel house, which also has stores in London and Monte Carlo. Other people might think twice about making another big expenditure. But not Mr. Graff. On Tuesday, he bought the 50-carat ''La Favorite'' diamond ring at Christie's for $3.6 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graff, who has often sold rare, and larger, gems to the world's wealthy during his more than 40 years in the business, thinks the long, emerald-cut diamond -- named the most perfect diamond in America at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair -- could use improvement. ''I am going to recut it to make it totally flawless,'' he said. If all goes according to plan, he said, only a little of the diamond's weight will be lost.</p>

        <p>Mr. Graff, who has often sold rare, and larger, gems to the world's wealthy during his more than 40 years in the business, thinks the long, emerald-cut diamond -- named the most perfect diamond in America at the 1934 Chicago World's Fair -- could use improvement. ''I am going to recut it to make it totally flawless,'' he said. If all goes according to plan, he said, only a little of the diamond's weight will be lost.</p>
        <p>As no one has yet lined up to buy the new stone, he said, ''I'll just hold on to it for a while.''  Meantime, for those whose wallets are still bulging and who are undaunted by the dazzlingly large gems in the windows, ''La Favorite'' will be on view in about two weeks at the House of Graff on Madison Avenue, near 63rd Street.</p>
