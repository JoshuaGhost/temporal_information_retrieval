      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial, commenting on arrest of former Yugoslav Pres Slobodan Milosevic for abuse of his office, says action by Serbian authorities is heartening and should be only first step toward prosecuting him for crimes against humanity before war crimes tribunal in the Hague (M)</p>

        <p>Little more than six months ago, few people imagined that Slobodan Milosevic would soon be forced from power, much less that he would wind up in a Belgrade prison facing criminal charges within Yugoslavia. But that is where Mr. Milosevic resides today, following a tense standoff at his villa over the weekend that ended with his arrest. The determination of the Serbian authorities to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice is heartening. But as President Bush said yesterday, the arrest should be a first step toward prosecuting Mr. Milosevic for crimes against humanity at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
        <p>Seeing that Mr. Milosevic is eventually transferred to The Hague will require courageous leadership by the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia and a sustained commitment by the United States to bring him to justice. Belgrade and Washington will be tempted to settle for prosecuting Mr. Milosevic on domestic criminal charges.</p>

        <p>Little more than six months ago, few people imagined that Slobodan Milosevic would soon be forced from power, much less that he would wind up in a Belgrade prison facing criminal charges within Yugoslavia. But that is where Mr. Milosevic resides today, following a tense standoff at his villa over the weekend that ended with his arrest. The determination of the Serbian authorities to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice is heartening. But as President Bush said yesterday, the arrest should be a first step toward prosecuting Mr. Milosevic for crimes against humanity at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.</p>
        <p>Seeing that Mr. Milosevic is eventually transferred to The Hague will require courageous leadership by the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia and a sustained commitment by the United States to bring him to justice. Belgrade and Washington will be tempted to settle for prosecuting Mr. Milosevic on domestic criminal charges.</p>
        <p>We do not mean to belittle the case against Mr. Milosevic in Serbia or to suggest that his prosecution there would be politically painless for President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia and Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian prime minister. The weekend struggle over Mr. Milosevic's arrest reflected smoldering disputes in Belgrade. But the internal charges against Mr. Milosevic are not equal to the crimes he instigated in the Balkans over the last decade.</p>
        <p>The transformation of Yugoslavia from dictatorship to democracy is steadily advancing. Mr. Kostunica was legitimately elected last year and is committed to establishing democratic institutions and the rule of law. He has taken a number of steps to cooperate with the Hague tribunal. Mr. Djindjic is inclined to be even bolder in clearing away the political and economic vestiges of the Milosevic era.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Kostunica seems unwilling for now to see Mr. Milosevic prosecuted for crimes committed against non-Serbs. He has yet to release all the Albanian political prisoners held in Yugoslav jails and is opposed to turning Mr. Milosevic over to the court in The Hague. Mr. Kostunica ought to reconsider that position. Both Yugoslavia and its Balkan neighbors can more quickly and confidently recover from years of ethnic conflict if Mr. Milosevic is held accountable for crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic, who appears more willing to surrender Mr. Milosevic to The Hague, can use his considerable influence to speed that outcome. He controls most of the government machinery in Belgrade, but not the army, which takes its orders from Mr. Kostunica. The two men should work together to lay the legal and political groundwork for extraditing Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>With the arrest of Mr. Milosevic, there is an understandable desire in the Bush administration to release millions of dollars in American and international assistance to Yugoslavia. The White House is expected to decide soon whether Belgrade, as required by American law, has qualified for that aid by cooperating sufficiently with the war crimes tribunal and with the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended the war in Bosnia. We hope Mr. Bush will withhold or delay certification to maintain maximum leverage, but if he finds in Belgrade's favor, the president and Congress must set the scale and timing of future financial assistance to keep pressure on Mr. Kostunica to send Mr. Milosevic to The Hague. As Mr. Bush himself said yesterday, ''We cannot and must not forget the chilling images of terrified women and children herded onto trains, emaciated prisoners interned behind barbed wire and mass graves unearthed by U.N. investigators.''</p>
