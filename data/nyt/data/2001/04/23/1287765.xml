        <p>The only American weekly news magazine in a significant partnership with a Russian media company has lost its weekly voice, Itogi.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, Newsweek magazine executives became alarmed after hearing reports from Moscow that, in a strategy originating from the state-run monopoly Gazprom, dissident shareholders had seized control of Itogi from Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the onetime media mogul of Russia, and fired the entire staff.</p>
        <p>By Thursday, the chairman of Newsweek, Richard M. Smith, announced the partnership was ending.</p>
        <p>''We are taking this step with great sadness,'' he said in a statement, adding that the contract with Itogi stated that if ownership changed hands, the agreement would be void.</p>
        <p>''While the ownership remains under legal challenge,'' Mr. Smith said, ''this week's events in Moscow clearly indicate that control has passed to a new group. In accordance with the contract, Newsweek will no longer send editorial material to Itogi or sell advertising for the magazine.'' He also asked that Itogi no longer use the Newsweek logo, which appears on the cover.</p>
        <p>Newsweek, which is part of the Washington Post Company, also took a commission on advertisements that it sold for Itogi.</p>
        <p>The takeover of Itogi was the most recent in a string of events surrounding media control in Russia. On April 14, Gazprom took over the national television network, NTV, and on April 16 Gazprom helped engineer the shutdown of a daily newspaper, Sevodnya.</p>
        <p>Newsweek was different from both Time and U.S. News &amp; World Report in that it had a licensing agreement with the magazine -- which loosely translated means ''summary'' or ''in total'' -- that allowed Itogi to reprint significant portions of Newsweek's editorial content. U.S. News is not distributed in Russia -- although its Moscow correspondent contributed to Itogi -- and Time only distributes its European edition. The Economist is sold in Russia but in its English edition.</p>
