        <p>New York City has become such a melange of ethnic, religious and racial groups that today, all its residents are essentially minorities, Public Advocate Mark Green told a predominantly black congregation at a Harlem church yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, who plans to formally announce his mayoral candidacy tomorrow, told about 250 worshipers at St. Luke's A.M.E. Church on Amsterdam Avenue that the next mayor must recognize this reality and, in a not-so-subtle criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, do a better job in unifying the city's disparate groups.</p>

        <p>New York City has become such a melange of ethnic, religious and racial groups that today, all its residents are essentially minorities, Public Advocate Mark Green told a predominantly black congregation at a Harlem church yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, who plans to formally announce his mayoral candidacy tomorrow, told about 250 worshipers at St. Luke's A.M.E. Church on Amsterdam Avenue that the next mayor must recognize this reality and, in a not-so-subtle criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, do a better job in unifying the city's disparate groups.</p>
        <p>''After a decade of division by race, by class, by ethnicity and by borough, it is now essential we unite as a city,'' Mr. Green said, his notes resting on an open Bible at the pulpit.  ''We have to cross racial and class lines to speak to one New York.''</p>
        <p>His church appearance came on what was yet another busy Sunday of campaigning by the Democratic candidates for mayor.</p>
        <p>City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone made at least six stops yesterday, across Manhattan and Brooklyn. Like Mr. Green, he made his schedule serve as a tribute of sorts to the city's diversity, attending separate ceremonies commemorating the mass killings of Jews during World War II and of Armenians 86 years ago in what today is Turkey. He also stopped at City Hall for an Earth Day-inspired news conference to urge more energy conservation by city residents and businesses.</p>
        <p>The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, speaking at a mayoral candidates' forum sponsored by the 504 Democratic Club, a group that focuses on the rights of the disabled, talked about what he called the ''two New Yorks,'' one where hotels are full, trash gets picked up and crime has declined, and the other where the schools are failing, health care is difficult to get and housing is not affordable, said his spokesman John Del Cecheo. Mr. Ferrer said he comes from the second New York.</p>
        <p>City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi held his own news conference outside City Hall to criticize a plan by the Water Board to increase water and sewer rates by 3.5 percent next year.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Green, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Hevesi also appeared at the 504 Democratic Club forum. George N. Spitz, a fifth Democrat running for mayor, also spoke at that event.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's comments at St. Luke's, one of Manhattan's largest African Methodist Episcopal churches, touched on themes that already have become central to his soon-to-be-official campaign. He criticized the Giuliani administration for not doing enough to ensure that police officers guilty of abuse or misconduct are punished. And he talked about how a city that thrived in many ways during the 1990's still has room for improvement and inclusion.</p>
        <p>''If you can work with me in a coalition of change, diversity and unity, the greatest city on earth is about to get better,'' said Mr. Green, citing Robert F. Kennedy as a role model.</p>
        <p>Speaking at his Earth Day news conference on the steps of City Hall yesterday, Mr. Vallone seemed to reach a bit to gain his share of the day's news coverage: he held up an energy-efficient light bulb that he said could help cut electricity use and improve air quality in the region.</p>
        <p>''If we just change to these kinds of bulbs over the next year, we would reduce the demand for energy enormously,'' Mr. Vallone said, adding that he hoped to introduce legislation that would give companies and residents tax breaks for buying energy efficient products.</p>
        <p>At his own City Hall Park news conference, Mr. Hevesi said that the proposed rate increase by the Water Board, which would cost the average metered household about $16 a year, is needed only because of inaccurate budget projections and the poor job the city does collecting delinquent water and sewer bills.</p>
        <p>In the last 15 years, Mr. Hevesi said, city water and sewer rates have gone up 251 percent, or four times the rate of inflation. And rate increases are now planned every year through at least 2006.</p>
        <p>''They are not managing their money as appropriately as they should,'' Mr. Hevesi said.</p>
