        <p>Thousands of people, precariously balanced on mountains of rubble in this earthquake-ravaged town, chanted ''Clinton, Clinton!'' as the former president toured the ruins today, solemnly laying roses in a lane where 150 schoolchildren were buried alive when the ground shook on Jan. 26.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton, with his scandal-tinged exit from office, may elicit an exhausted sigh from many Americans, but here he still draws adoring throngs of ordinary Indians a year after he became the first American president to visit this country of one billion people in 22 years.</p>
        <p>And he basked in their affection today on the first full day of a week-long visit that will also take him to Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi. At the devastated villages and towns he visited, Mr. Clinton ardently declared, ''I intend to come back to India for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>This time, he came as chairman of the new American India Foundation, which was formed by wealthy Indian-American entrepreneurs, executives and doctors.</p>
        <p>They have set themselves a goal of raising $50 million to rebuild 100 of the 1,000 villages that were more than 50 percent destroyed by the earthquake here in the western state of Gujarat. So far, they said they had collected more than $8 million.</p>
        <p>State officials said that private groups -- not including the foundation -- had entered agreements with the government to rehabilitate 286 villages. ''A huge number of villages are still waiting to be adopted,'' said Palani Panneervel, the state's commissioner of relief. ''Bill Clinton's visit will be a big boost to us.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of Indian-American business people and professionals accompanied Mr. Clinton today on a grueling five-hour tour. Many of the millionaires were packed into unairconditioned minivans without so much as a cold drink on a sweltering day when temperatures surpassed 105 degrees.</p>
        <p>Sweat dripped down their faces and soaked their polo shirts, kurtas and long-sleeved business attire, as they drove past the tent camps of those made homeless by the earthquake.</p>
        <p>They are among the growing ranks of successful Indian-Americans, many of them from Silicon Valley, looking for a way to give something back to India. They said they were awed by the scale of the devastation and determined to find a way to spend their money so it goes to the people who need it.</p>
        <p>The earthquake killed more than 20,000 people, injured 166,000, destroyed or damaged more than a million homes and did property damage of 21,000 crores of rupees (1 crore equals 10 million rupees). This would mean damage amounting to about $4.5 billion.</p>
        <p>''Unless you're here, you can't really feel it and you've got to feel it,'' said Rajat Gupta, managing director of McKinsey &amp; Co., the management consulting firm. ''It's a fact-finding and experiencing mission.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gupta and Victor J. Menezes, president and chief executive officer of Citibank, who are the foundation's vice chairmen, were among those who met with Mr. Clinton in early February to discuss what to do in response to the earthquake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said today at a news  conference in Bhuj, where a collapsed hospital formed his backdrop, that he had spoken with India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, after the earthquake -- and that Mr. Vajpayee told him that the country would need help with the long-term tasks of rebuilding schools, housing, hospitals and people's ability to make a living.</p>
        <p>''I came to look, to listen, to learn and to try to determine how we can best help the people of all these villages,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>For the people here, Mr. Clinton was simply a good man who was coming to their aid, and they seemed to have little or no awareness or interest in the former president's latest troubles surrounding the pardons he issued before leaving office.</p>
        <p>In Ratnal, a prosperous village of truck drivers and farmers that was flattened by the earthquake, clusters of elderly men in white turbans, women in the traditional mirrored and embroidered dress of the region and young workers taking a day off lined the road for a glimpse of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''He's a big personality in the world,'' said Arjan Bhai, 32, a truck driver. ''Something good will come of his visit, though we don't know what it will be.''</p>
        <p>The crowd burst into applause when they saw that it was not trucks overloaded with sheaves of barley, or dusty buses loaded with passengers or sputtering scooters approaching them on the road, but finally, an hour late, Mr. Clinton's entourage.</p>
        <p>He emerged from his black van and stood on a cleared, dirt patch in the midst of acres of rubble, splintered wood and collapsed red tile roofs, and waved somberly to the villagers.</p>
        <p>In the town of Anjar, admirers broke through the police barricades to encircle and touch Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>He finished up in Bhuj with a tour of the Red Cross field hospital and a stint at the microphone for a news conference. As he left, he spoke briefly with the Indian journalists who mobbed him.</p>
        <p>In his last words, as he tried to explain why he gone so far from home to find people to help, he said, ''I'm just trying to find something useful to do in a place I care about.''</p>
