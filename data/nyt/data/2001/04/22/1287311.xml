        <p>PAGES FOR YOU</p>
        <p>By Sylvia Brownrigg.</p>
        <p>264 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.</p>
        <p>Flannery Jansen is 17, a Californian newly arrived at a fancy East Coast college, ready to be introduced to such exotic features of New England life as jelly omelets and literary theory classes. To her own surprise as much as anyone's in ''Pages for You,'' Flannery's first year will be dominated by a love affair with Anne, a graduate student who teaches a section of Flannery's Intro to Criticism class. Anne is brilliant and beautiful, almost hypnotic in her charisma. She's a figure of unapproachable perfection, and when she seems to show an interest in Flannery the effect is immediate and overwhelming.</p>
        <p>With an admirable respect for the importance of youthful passion, Sylvia Brownrigg, the author of another novel, ''The Metaphysical Touch,'' as well as a collection of stories, ''Ten Women Who Shook the World,'' spins out this modern version of the age-old story of first love and sexual initiation. Since Anne is a teacher and Flannery a student, the relationship is kept secret, but a certain amount of concealment suits Flannery's recessive, wary personality anyway. The two women's discretion is also crucial to the novel's determination to make its subject a gay love affair without being a ''gay novel.'' While it's clear that Flannery's lifelong orientation will be toward other women (unlike Anne's), she's not eager to attach the label ''lesbian'' to herself. She just wants ''to shelter in Anne. She could worry about the rest later: the group talks and protests, the specialist bookstores and specialist books.'' Brownrigg deftly handles this irony of gay love: while the ''specialists'' paved the way for a teenager like Flannery to be able to move smoothly and safely into her adult sexuality, there's something lost when the most private discoveries are folded too automatically into a political movement.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, homophobia hovers on the edges and seeps into a few brief scenes, but it never presents any real threat to Flannery's delight in her newfound erotic life, or to her and Anne's relationship. The novel is bathed in a joyful, cloistered mood of sensual celebration. Whether their love will be long-lasting or transient is determined by all the ordinary factors: the mysterious way any two personalities play off each other and how any two people discover the limits, or limitlessness, of their connection.</p>
        <p>From Flannery's perspective, the romance crowds out all other experiences and dwarfs all other concerns. The routines of college life are merely distractions, or backdrop, to her love for Anne and her sexual awakening. She can barely remember her roommate's name. Meanwhile, we learn about the time she spends with Anne in patient, even obsessive detail: an entire brief chapter is about Flannery's discovery of the pleasures of showering with a lover, and another to settling the question of which endearment she should use for Anne (she goes with ''sweetheart'').</p>
        <p>WHILE it makes a certain kind of sense, Brownrigg's devotion to Flannery's besotted point of view ends up making the novel feel more like a hothouse than like the garden the author seems to want it to be. Too often the reader craves a blast of cool, fresh air; too often it's hard to tell if we're in the presence of a rich sensuality or a cloying neediness. In part it's simply Flannery's nature to give herself over to an intensely focused, all-consuming love, and Brownrigg shows us the depth of character this reflects. But Flannery's fixation is also potentially stifling, both of other aspects of herself and, ultimately, inevitably, of Anne. By the time Flannery is mournfully saying that ''we could have traveled enough for me if we had just stayed in your room,'' we understand too well why Anne needs to break free of her young lover's clutching grip, and what we feel for the bereft Flannery is a little too close to pity. Brownrigg tells us that Flannery will be a writer, and that Anne will be her muse. In a way, then, ''Pages for You'' is too perfect a record of Flannery's ingenuous, worshipful, doomed love for Anne: a defiantly, perilously self-contained universe.</p>
