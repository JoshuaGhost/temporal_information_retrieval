        <p>FOR the first time in years, my central New Jersey town has not been covered with mushy brown, frost-destroyed magnolia petals. The continuous cold of our so-called endless winter ensured that the buds on traditionally early bloomers stayed tightly closed.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of magnolias in my town and throughout much of the northeast are Asian varieties that flower before their leaves unfurl.</p>
        <p>Give them a couple of days of warm, late winter sunshine and they are ready to strut their stuff. In their Asian haunts, this works out fine because frosts rarely appear after such weather. But on our continent, such balmy temperatures are almost always followed by devastating cold spells.</p>
        <p>The fact that the flowers on these Asian magnolias are particularly vulnerable to frosts did not stop 19th-century plant explorers from sending them back to the Northeast. The ubiquitous star magnolia (Magnolia  stellata), for example, made its American debut in 1862 in Long Island, and has been blasted by spring frosts ever since.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, plant breeders started developing magnolias that would look lovely in northern springs. They initially used genetic stock from a second group of Asian magnolias, those that flower later and just as their leaves unfurl. There was also an emphasis on shorter magnolias, plants that would be suitable for small properties.</p>
        <p>The Leonard Messel magnolia (M. x loebneri), developed in England, was the first such magnolia to make an appearance. This tree, about 15 feet tall, can take temperatures down to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Its lovely pink flowers are the most frost resistant of all magnolias.</p>
        <p>Two United States National Arboretum scientists did outstanding work in the area. In 1955, Francis de Vos began to transfer pollen from star magnolia cultivars to lily magnolia (M. lilliflora) cultivars. William Kosar continued the effort, with the result that eight very special hybrids were introduced in 1965.</p>
        <p>In horticultural circles, these magnolias are known as the de Vos and Kosar hybrids. To the general gardening public, they are known as the Eight Little Girls because of their relatively small stature and because their names honor arboretum secretaries or staff wives and daughters.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, I planted one of these magnolias. Betty tops out at 14 feet and is covered with eight-inch wide, pink and white flowers for up to six spring weeks. Neither pests nor diseases have bothered it in the decade it has graced my garden. As all magnolias require, it was placed in a sunny spot with reasonably fertile, well-drained soil.</p>
        <p>Betty's siblings are named Ann, Jane, Judy, Pinkie, Randy, Ricki, and Susan. All are hardy to minus 20 degrees. Their lily magnolia genes place them in the second group of magnolias, giving them late flowering characteristics, and their star magnolia genes provide mildew resistance and prolific, fragrant flowers. Both parents ensure that none of the girls exceed 20 feet; most are in the 12-foot range.</p>
        <p>All eight were honored with an Award of Garden Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1993. And all have some sporadic bloom through summer. It's enough to make you realize that these are great plants.</p>
        <p>For the first time in my garden, Betty jump-started its flowering period last year. Its luscious blossoms opened at the end of an exceptionally balmy March. Though soon punished by frost, it continued to bloom -- albeit with ugly brown spots at the end of many petals.</p>
        <p>Until the past few decades, those wanting magnolia flowers completely unaffected by frost had to rely on towering American magnolias, which range in height from 50 to 90 feet. Nature gave their flowers frost protection by providing them with fully emerged, sheltering leaves and with a late spring flowering date.</p>
        <p>In 1968, however, Ray Bracken discovered a 20-foot-tall, exceptionally hardy form of a southern magnolia (M. grandiflora) growing in his South Carolina nursery. He registered it in 1987 and named it Bracken's Brown Beauty. Thriving in winter temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees, it bears numerous fragrant white flowers in late spring and repeat blooms throughout summer.</p>
        <p>Out in California, Todd Greshman made a significant contribution with his 1986 introduction Porcelain Dove, a hybrid between the Asian M. globosa and the American M. virginiana. This 15-foot tree, hardy to minus 20 degrees, bears wonderfully fragrant white flowers that turn warm, humid summer evenings into luxurious experiences. While the heaviest bloom occurs in June, flowers continue to open throughout July and August.</p>
        <p>August Kehr, a retired United States Department of Agriculture research scientist, has taken another approach. Working independently in western North Carolina, he has been creating frost-resistant flowers that open before leaves unfurl.</p>
        <p>In 1995, he introduced Eskimo, with 5- to 6-inch wide flowers consisting of pale lilac petals that can tolerate at least six degrees of frost. This slow-growing tree -- only 10 feet tall in 20 years -- is just now becoming commercially available. Eskimo is easily hardy to minus 10 degrees and perhaps to minus 20.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of magnolias are available from Fairweather Gardens, P.O. Box 330, Greenwich, N.J. 08323, (856) 451-6261; catalog $4; and Roslyn Nursery, 211 Burrs Lane, Dix Hills, N.Y. 11746; (631) 643-9347; catalog $3.</p>
