        <p>JOHN GIARDINA, a 9-year-old student at Greenwood Sudbury School, does not have to wait for summer vacation to spend his days playing outside.</p>
        <p>Fed up after a long, dreary winter, John leaves his books and class projects behind and wanders outside the school into the spring air whenever he likes. At Greenwood, his teachers do not try to stop him.</p>
        <p>''I can go outside whenever I want,'' John said. ''I like to get to choose the rules.''</p>
        <p>Such is the concept of the Sudbury school system, a democratic model of education that is being applied at about 25 schools worldwide. The Greenwood Sudbury school is the only one in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>There are Sudbury schools in Australia, England, Canada, New Zealand, Israel and in 14 of the United States. They are modeled after the Sudbury Valley School in Framingham, Mass., which began in 1968 with the concept that children do not need curriculum, grades, tests or mandatory classes to learn.</p>
        <p>Instead, supporters of the school system believe children learn best when they educate themselves through what interests them the most. The teachers simply encourage the students in this process.</p>
        <p>In the last year, professors and students from the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, the Lisbon branch of Sacred Heart University and State University New York in New Paltz have made the rounds of Greenwood, which opened in 1993 on Route 97 in Hampton.</p>
        <p>A group of seven adults are planning to open a Sudbury school in the Hartford area and have applied to the state for nonprofit status. Only three other states -- California, Oregon and Colorado -- have more than one Sudbury school.</p>
        <p>''I think what appeals to me most about the Sudbury model is that children are given the opportunity to pursue things they might be interested in and follow their own curiosity rather than be dictated by the outside world what to learn,'' said Mary Panke, a Vernon resident and one of the parents who wants to start a Sudbury school.</p>
        <p>While other private schools limit teacher control and give students greater responsibility, none do so to the same degree as a Sudbury school, said Richard Reynolds, associate professor of education at Eastern Connecticut State, who visited the school with his students.</p>
        <p>At Greenwood, there are 17 students ages 5 to 19. The annual tuition at the private school is $4,000. The school is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, but the students choose their own hours.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best example of this student autonomy is the weekly school meeting, the so-called legislative branch of the school government. Here, each student and teacher gets to vote on such matters as the approval of financial expenditures and development of school policy or laws. Staff members are elected every May.</p>
        <p>''Either you're dead meat or the kids think you are someone they want to be around,'' said Holly Rawson, a founder and staff member at Greenwood.</p>
        <p>There are only two requirements for students at a Sudbury school. They must participate in clean-up duties and they must periodically serve on the Judicial Committee, which acts as a jury to hear complaints regarding infractions of school laws. The jury consists of one staff member and four students who serve a rotating two-week term. No one is exempt from this process, not even Ms. Rawson, who was given a warning after forgetting to do a chore.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rawson, who used to run a psychotherapy practice with her husband, was part of a network of parents who taught their children at home. They were not unhappy with the content of public schools, but with what they described as a rigid, stifling educational process.</p>
        <p>When a friend asked her to visit the Sudbury school in Massachusetts with the idea of forming their own school, Ms. Rawson reluctantly agreed. She was worried that she would not have time for such a grand project.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rawson was immediately impressed with what she saw. In one of the large community rooms, students of all ages (Sudbury schools do not divide students by age or into grades) were participating in several different activities. Some played cards. Others played with blocks. One child was reading a book, while still another was having a snack. Ms. Rawson said a couple of students were having some sort of philosophical discussion.</p>
        <p>''Five minutes after I walked into the door I was literally in tears,'' Ms. Rawson said. ''I could see my daughter doing this. I remember punching Randy in the arm and saying, 'All right, I'm in.'</p>
        <p>''I believe we are still under the myth from the Puritan legacy that people are inherently lazy and that if we don't teach they are going to be a bunch of lazy, couch potatoes,'' Ms. Rawson said. ''I believe with Aristotle that people are inherently curious. If left to our own devices, unimpeded and uncontrolled, we will indeed in time garner all of the skills, wisdom and knowledge necessary to create the perfect lives four ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of Sudbury contend that their teachers do not have to struggle to motivate children to learn. In fact, one parent, Barbara Giardina, said her son John got upset if he had to miss school because of sickness or a snow day. Ms. Rawson said that the students at Greenwood had even voted to cancel spring vacation so that they could attend school.</p>
        <p>She added that Sudbury graduates have gone on to college and to start their own businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds said the Sudbury system tends to produce responsible students. But he added that there were potential drawbacks.</p>
        <p>''These are children from families who you might describe as avant-garde, new age,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''It is based on an existential view of life, that you are the sum total of your choices, In regular school you don't get too much choice. When the bell rings you move from class to class.</p>
        <p>''But once you apply morality to the model it doesn't work very well. Morality requires some guidance. To tell some 14-year-old to come up with moral answers I don't know if they have the experience and background to do that. I wonder if it's expecting too much from kids.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Panke said it does require faith on behalf of the parent that a child can be trusted with great responsibilities.</p>
        <p>''There are children whose parents will not have enough faith not to intervene,'' she said. ''For it to work it has to be a 100 percent commitment that you are telling your child you trust them and you have the confidence for them to make their own decisions and back them up on it.''</p>
        <p>For that reason alone, Mr. Reynolds does not expect a sudden growth in Sudbury schools despite the increased public exposure recently.</p>
        <p>''Do they have a big future?'' he asked. ''I don't think so. It requires such a big adjustment from traditional thinking that for most people it's too much. But they have a point. If you want kids to be responsible then let kids exercise responsibility.''</p>
