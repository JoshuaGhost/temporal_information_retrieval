        <p>A key legislative committee approved a bill today that would require every city and town in Connecticut to electronically link its voter registration databases to a centralized state system, to prevent voter fraud and allow voters to register on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of states have such a statewide system. New York and New Jersey do not.</p>
        <p>All but 27 of Connecticut's 169 municipalities are already hooked up to a registration database run by the secretary of the state's office. The Democratic-sponsored bill is intended to force the remaining cities and towns resisting the state connection -- including several wealthy towns like Greenwich, Stamford, Westport and West Hartford -- to begin sharing their voter rolls by February 2003. Those towns complain that the new system is slow and prone to errors and that it infringes on the state's tradition of home rule.</p>
        <p>The registration measure is part of a larger bill, approved today by the General Assembly's joint Government Administration and Elections Committee, that would provide up to $20 million to buy electronic voting equipment to replace the state's Eisenhower-era lever-voting machines. The bill is now headed to the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which is expected to refer it to the General Assembly's joint Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>Like many other state legislatures, Connecticut's General Assembly has drawn up several bills intended to prevent the ballot confusion that Florida elections officials endured after November's presidential vote.</p>
        <p>''One of the lessons of Florida is that there ought to be a uniform voting registration system in a state,'' said Representative Alex Knopp, a Democrat from Norwalk and a co-chairman of the government administration committee.</p>
        <p>Gathering all municipal voter registration rolls in one database would not computerize the act of voting or change how towns and cities record and count votes. The bill would, however, prevent people from registering in more than one town, and require all voters to sign an affidavit that they have not voted elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Current state law allows unregistered voters to enter a local precinct on Election Day and cast a ballot for president without registering or showing any form of identification. Theoretically, no law prevents a voter from traveling from one town to the next, casting ballots for president in each, said the secretary of the state, Susan Bysiewicz.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bysiewicz said a statewide system would help prevent vote fraud and also make Election Day registration possible. ''You can't have same-day voter registration until you have all the towns online,'' she said after the committee vote.</p>
        <p>She said she had difficulty understanding why any municipal government would resist joining the state's database. ''I don't think it's in the interest of any voter in Connecticut to have a system that allows fraud.''</p>
        <p>Many local election officials remain wary of joining the state's seven-year-old system because technical glitches can make updating voter rolls slow and inaccurate. In several cities, officials expressed more confidence in their own voter registration process than in Ms. Bysiewicz's.</p>
        <p>''I would thoroughly recommend that the state look at our system,'' said Janet T. Weintraub, one of Stamford's two registrars of voters, who have refused to integrate their operation with the state's. ''It's a superior system.''</p>
        <p>Greenwich officials began integrating town voter rolls with the state database in late 1999, but soon pulled out after problems developed.</p>
