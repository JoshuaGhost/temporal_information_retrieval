        <p>Health</p>
        <p>Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, unveiled a budget today that would provide a big boost to the National Institutes of Health, more money for community health centers and a new prescription drug benefit for the elderly.</p>
        <p>But to help meet those priorities and stay within overall spending limits, the budget proposal would  shave money from an array of programs, including federal aid for medical training and a program to coordinate care for the uninsured.</p>
        <p>''The president's budget is responsive to children and families who need a helping hand, while being responsible to the taxpayers who offer that hand,'' Mr. Thompson said.</p>
        <p>But Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, said, ''The president's budget proposal literally shortchanges Americans' health care by providing too little support and reaching too few people.''</p>
        <p>Rather than using the budget surplus to shore up Medicare and cover the uninsured, Mr. Pollack said, the budget ''siphons off billions of dollars for tax reductions.''</p>
        <p>The Bush budget would provide $156 billion over 10 years to pay for prescription drug benefits and restructuring Medicare. The amount is widely considered inadequate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson acknowledged that estimates of the cost differed greatly, but he said the administration was committed to providing the benefits and hoped to help offset their cost with savings from restructuring Medicare.</p>
        <p>The department's discretionary spending (outside the entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid) would grow by 5 percent under the Bush proposal, an increase of about $2.7 billion over the 2001 fiscal year's. The National Institutes of Health was the major winner in this ''redirection of resources,'' as the budget called the shifting of money among programs. The institutes would get $23.1 billion for the 2002 fiscal year, an increase of $2.75 billion or 13.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson acknowledged some ''grumbling'' in his department about the amount of money going to the institutes and medical research. But he asked: ''What's more important than finding a cure for cancer? What's more important than finding a cure for Alzheimer's?''</p>
        <p>The administration's main proposals for the uninsured include the expansion of community health centers, which serve 11 million people, about 4.4 million of them uninsured, and a tax credit to help the uninsured buy coverage in the private market. About 42.5 million Americans do not have health insurance.</p>
