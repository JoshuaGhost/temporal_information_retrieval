        <p>BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Picador USA, $12.) At the start of this boldly drawn tale, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award and was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, two middle-aged zoology professors lie murdered on a remote salt dune. The narrative then unfolds along several strands: one tracks the bodies' decomposition, another spools backward through the couple's final day and a third recalls their initial meeting on the same dunes 30 years earlier. ''Few novels are as unsparing as this one in presenting the ephemerality of love given the implacability of death, and few are as moving in depicting the undiminished achievement love nevertheless represents,'' Jim Shepard wrote here.</p>
        <p>THE GLOBAL SOUL: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls, and the Search for Home, by Pico Iyer. (Vintage Departures, $13.) In a series of essays, a peripatetic journalist explores the phenomenon of global displacement and the cross-cultural collisions that result, finding, for example, a Toronto restaurant that serves ''Indian Pakistani-style Chinese food.'' ''Iyer is a good writer with a sharp eye, a well-furnished mind and a keen moral sense,'' Luc Sante said here last year.</p>
        <p>GOLD DIGGER: The Outrageous Life and Times of Peggy Hopkins Joyce, by Constance Rosenblum. (Owl/Holt, $15.) This biography, by an editor at The New York Times, is a walk on the wild side of the Jazz Age, tracing the fortunes of a former Ziegfeld showgirl who became a notorious femme fatale and tabloid sensation. The result is ''an entertaining and meticulously researched'' portrait, Leslie Chess Feller wrote in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) In this first novel, a dissolute small-town jurist named Evers Wheeling punctuates his all-day boozing and dope smoking by taking a bribe from a mysterious woman and getting sucked into a disastrous treasure-hunting scheme. ''Clark has produced an oddly stirring portrait of a man in existential disarray,'' Robert Draper said in the Book Review in 2000.In spare yet delightfully idiosyncratic prose, he captures a drowsy world of beaten dreamers.''</p>
        <p>RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) The intricate tale of two African-American couples -- two brothers married to two sisters -- becomes a chronicle of the varieties of black experience over much of the last century and a record of lives in transit. This ambitious first novel ''evokes the works of Joyce and Faulkner'' with its ''surges of multivocal prose,'' Stephen Donadio wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>THE VISION OF EMMA BLAU, by Ursula Hegi. (Scribner, $14.) This novel tracks four generations and nearly a century in the life of a German-American family in rural New Hampshire. It is ''about legacies and hopes, curses and constraints: the places we come from and the families we build,'' Diana Postlethwaite said here in 2000. ''Hegi demonstrates that all these matters are richly ambivalent.''</p>
        <p>PONTIUS PILATE, by Ann Wroe. (Modern Library, $14.95.) In her speculative biography of the Roman who presided over the trial of Jesus, the author reconstructs a possible world in which the prefect of Judea passed his days. In this ''highly readable and . . .valuable study,'' Reynolds Price wrote in these pages last year, Pilate ''emerges from Wroe's best pages as a sanely detailed and singular figure.'' Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus, by Thomas Cahill (Nan A. Talese/Anchor, $14), is a penetrating study of ''the phenomenon of Jesus, as experienced by those who knew him best and by the first generations of his followers,'' according to its author. The result is a ''rare and inspiring book,'' Paul William Roberts said here in 2000.</p>
        <p>BONE IN THE THROAT, by Anthony Bourdain. (Bloomsbury, $14.95.) The hero of this satirical first novel is a Manhattan chef squeezed by bullies on both sides of the law when the F.B.I. decides to conduct a sting to snare the Mafia racketeer who is bankrolling his restaurant. ''The author's comic vision goes beyond original,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote here in 1995. ''It is deliciously depraved.''</p>
        <p>SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN: An Environmental History of the Twentieth-Century World, by J. R. McNeill. (Norton, $15.95.) A history professor employs a wealth of statistics in recounting the many ways in which humans have altered the earth. By and large, it's not a pretty picture. Last year in these pages, Dick Teresi called this ''an original work of history, exhaustively researched and carefully written.''</p>
