        <p>OVER the last few years, this restaurant, set back on busy North Bedford Road,  has undergone a quick succession of ownerships, at one time or another Bacco, Chuck's Steak House, Bedford Grille, Rockwell's, Spiga and Mitty's. Mystic Grill, the new occupant, may very well be a keeper.</p>
        <p>Not two months old, the operation still has to straighten a few kinks -- lack of a coat room, cloudy glassware -- and to find its identity. The sprawling menu needs and is undergoing refinement.</p>
        <p>At the moment Mystic calls itself a family restaurant, although a sophisticated atmosphere and an interesting menu belie that label. Meanwhile, it's a nice, informal place to know about. There is a children's menu, but on our visits well-dressed adults occupied the tables with only one or two children in attendance.</p>
        <p>When it comes to raw bars, it's usually all or nothing. Mystic's seemed half-hearted. Only Blue Points and clams were available, and although the oysters were passable, this raw bar could not compete with those at places stocking at least a half-dozen seasonal species of oysters.</p>
        <p>Start, instead, with five-layer crab dip. This stacked cylinder of black beans, guacamole, crab and corn came with a confetti of tortilla chips; bland for all their color, the chips made handy scoops for the delicious dip. Or dig into meaty, chunky baby ribs (available as an entree as well) with mild but flavorful barbecue sauce and a side of tasty cole slaw, an appealing match. Soft-shell crab arrived in a weighty batter, but deep-fried baby calamari were light and better than the usual bar item. Needing rethinking, however, pan-fried oysters were mysteriously flattened, and small bits of skewered Thai chicken were dry, hard and simply awful.</p>
        <p>Entrees included a few sturdy pasta dishes. Although more broccoli would have provided balance to the dish, the best of the pastas was a bowl of linguine tossed with shrimp, succulent scallops and a well-seasoned garlic, white wine and butter sauce. At the other end of the pole, pasta with washed-out nuggets of sausage, roast duck and vegetables in saffron broth promised plenty of flavor but delivered none.</p>
        <p>These days lightly seared, sesame-crusted tuna seems to appear on every restaurant's menu, but what makes it an item one can order again and again is the myriad ways it can be garnished to make it unusual: with a drizzle of honey-lime dressing, on a bed of thick Asian noodles dressed with sesame oil, or with Sichuan pepper and seaweed salad, to name a few.</p>
        <p>At Mystic, the tuna was presented with a nori rice roll, pickled ginger and a lovely slaw of shredded white and red cabbage and julienne string beans and carrots.</p>
        <p>Moist grouper dusted with corn flour was a special to look for, but a double, two-inch thick pork chop arrived a tad dry, a pity, as luscious sautéed sweet peppers, onions and rosemary potatoes shared the plate.  Porterhouse steak oozed its juiciness into a cloud of mashed potatoes.  Packing even more flavor, hanger steak was just as tender.</p>
        <p>From an ample dessert tray goblets of tiramisù -- blueberry and chocolate -- fruit-topped cheesecake and walnut square satisfied the sweet tooth. Apples in phyllo tasted more like apple sauce and profiteroles were tough.</p>
        <p>The price range is broad. A three-course dinner averages $33 without drinks, tax and tip. Mystic is in a small shopping strip just south of Green Lane.</p>
        <p>Mystic Grill  728 North Bedford Road  (Route 117),  Bedford Hills. (914) 666-4666.  GOOD</p>
