        <p>Even before he enters the gates of this historic walled city to attend the Summit of the Americas, President Bush faces  major challenges to fulfilling his  promise of using the forum to elevate the importance of relations with Latin America and breathe new life into American plans for a hemisphere-wide free trade deal.</p>
        <p>The critical trade negotiating legislation that Mr. Bush pledged last summer to have well under way by now has not even been introduced in Congress.</p>
        <p>And the administration's attempt to speed up the schedule for negotiating and setting up a vast Free Trade Area of the Americas was soundly defeated earlier this month, in part because of the objections of countries like Brazil that feel the United States is trying to dominate the region economically.</p>
        <p>The conference, which begins Friday, is Mr. Bush's first big international meeting, and he has long portrayed it as a prominent stage on which he intends to open a new era of hemispheric harmony. Besides the impact it will have in the region, the summit meeting is also expected to have lasting repercussions on the administration's ability to pursue other goals.</p>
        <p>The president's arrival in Quebec without the trade measures he had promised is sure to frustrate some of the 33 other leaders who have already waited six years for a sign of  Washington's commitment to the hemispheric trade deal, said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, an academic forum.  He added that Mr. Bush needed to send a clear signal that he was moving forward with his agenda despite the recent setbacks or risk deepening the ''unhappiness, disappointment and sense of lost opportunity,'' already present in Latin America.</p>
        <p>The region is eager to hear Mr. Bush's message. Carlos Echeverría, head of the Costa Rican delegation,  said that while the conference was about far more than trade, gaining open access to the American market was of utmost importance to developing nations.</p>
        <p>''We hope that the U.S. Congress is going to get a message from all this and give Mr. Bush what he needs to get the trade deal going,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people concerned about issues from human rights to the high cost of AIDS medicines in undeveloped countries have already gathered here. They are separated from the delegates by several miles of concrete barricades and chain link fencing.</p>
        <p>Quebec itself became noticeably edgier this week after José Bové, the French sheep farmer who vandalized a McDonald's restaurant in France in an antiglobalization protest a few years ago, arrived here saying, ''Even if some windows are going down on Saturday, that is not violence.'' And after authorities arrested six Canadian men headed for Quebec with smoke bombs, military stun grenades and other items that the police said were to be used to disrupt the meeting, shopkeepers began to board up their windows.</p>
        <p>The leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including health, education and Plan Colombia, under which the United States is providing $1.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia to help resolve a guerrilla uprising and drug problem. The leaders of several Latin American countries are expected to try to buttonhole President Bush to  express their concerns about the plan, which they fear could heighten  the fighting and cause it to spill over to other nations.</p>
        <p>A number of countries, led by Canada and Peru, are pushing hard for the adoption of a clear commitment to democracy in the region that will give a stronger policing role to the Organization of American States. A point of contention is expected to be how narrowly delegates are willing to define the concept of a functioning democracy. Nations that veer from democratic principles would be prohibited from taking part in future summit meetings and regional trade associations.</p>
        <p>The most controversial part of the summit is discussion of plans to create the world's largest trading block, with 800 million people from the Arctic to Argentina. All 34 nations support the proposal. In Buenos Aires earlier this month, Chile, backed by the United States, proposed accelerating the date for completing the pact to 2003 from 2005.</p>
