        <p>Two Destinies Linked</p>
        <p>MEL STOTTLEMYRE, the Yankees' pitching coach, said that if JOE TORRE left after this season, it would ''be time for me to leave as well.'' Mr. Torre's negotiations for a new contract as general manager have stalled; he said on Sunday that he and the Yankees' principal owner, GEORGE M. STEINBRENNER III, would come to terms -- or not -- during the summer.</p>

        <p>Two Destinies Linked</p>
        <p>MEL STOTTLEMYRE, the Yankees' pitching coach, said that if JOE TORRE left after this season, it would ''be time for me to leave as well.'' Mr. Torre's negotiations for a new contract as general manager have stalled; he said on Sunday that he and the Yankees' principal owner, GEORGE M. STEINBRENNER III, would come to terms -- or not -- during the summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stottlemyre, below, who has bone marrow cancer and left for a stem-cell transplant before the Yankees won a place in the World Series, expects to spend the summer the way he is spending the spring: ''I'm not only back and traveling, I'm doing all my everyday duties as pitching coach for the Yankees,'' he said. ''No special restrictions or anything like that.'' His progress will be noted on Monday when Mr. Torre gives him an award from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation at Cipriani 42nd Street. JEAN STOTTLEMYRE, the coach's wife, will also receive an award.</p>
        <p>From 'Mean Streets' to Music</p>
        <p>MARTIN SCORSESE had lunch the other day with the composer GIAN CARLO MENOTTI, his son FRANCIS MENOTTI, his daughter-in-law MELINDA and her mother, HAPPY ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Scorsese, below, reminisced about seeing Mr. Menotti's opera ''The Saint of Bleecker Street'' in New York in the 1950's. Before long Francis Menotti was asking Mr. Scorsese to do what the directors LOUIS MALLE and ROMAN POLANSKI have done: stage an opera at Spoleto. ''He's thinking about it,'' Mr. Scorsese's spokeswoman said. ''No commitments have been made.''</p>
        <p>Mentioned in Passing</p>
        <p>Some of the characters casually referred to in MARY HIGGINS CLARK'S new novel, ''On the Street Where You Live,'' sound like real people doing their regular jobs of covering a story (in this case, a series of murders) -- among them RALPH PENZA of WNBC-TV and LUCY YANG of WABC-TV. But one reporter who breaks ground on the murders has a made-up name and works for a made-up newspaper.</p>
        <p>''She's not a sympathetic character,'' Mrs. Clark explained. ''She actually causes someone's death. I could get sued if I used somebody's name on it, and I had to make the paper she works for a daily instead of a weekly because of The Stars and The Enquirers out there.'' Ms. Yang did not mind the mention ''I'm glad I didn't get killed and glad I'm not the guilty one,'' she said. Mr. Penza said, ''As long as it's make-believe, I have no problem with it.''</p>
        <p>High Livers for a High Line</p>
        <p>The party for the Friends of the High Line on Wednesday was a gathering of women in headbands and men with big checkbooks. The hosts, AMANDA BURDEN and ALEXANDRE VON FURSTENBERG, and such guests as CHARLIE ROSE, the garden designer LYNDEN B. MILLER and her son, CITY COUNCILMAN A. GIFFORD MILLER -- were showing support for the High Line, a viaduct that runs from Gansevoort Street to West 34th Street on the far west side of Manhattan. Though there was no consensus about what to do with the line, there was agreement on one point: ''If you could get everyone up on the High Line,'' Councilman Miller said, ''we wouldn't need to fight this battle.''</p>
        <p>REPRESENTATIVE JERROLD L. NADLER (introduced by Ms. Burden as ''the patron of infrastructure'') was congratulated for saving the High Line when it was threatened in the 80's. So had he become an advocate? ''I don't think I've even been up on the High Line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Airborne Canine</p>
        <p>This is one of those rich-are-different stories: CELSO GONZALEZ-FALLA was telling airline horror stories at the American Theater Wing lunch the other day, starting with how he and his wife, SONDRA GILMAN GONZALEZ-FALLA, always take along their dog, a black German shepherd named Nefertiti.</p>
        <p>''When the plane is delayed, which is often, Sondra worries,'' he said. ''Also, when we got Nefertiti four and a half years ago, it only cost $50 to take her. Now it's $350.''</p>
        <p>He smiled the smile of a husband contemplating an expensive purchase, or at least a lease. ''I think Sondra should look at a jet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>DAISY SINCLAIR, a senior vice president at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, nodded.  ''For the dog,'' she said.</p>
