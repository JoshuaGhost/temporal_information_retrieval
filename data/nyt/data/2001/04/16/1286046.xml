      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>One of Shakespeare's most linguistically sophisticated plays, and also one of his most bitterly satirical, ''Troilus and Cressida'' is a sort of backstage drama, a tale of the bickering and backbiting that fester behind public presentation. It's a love story set during the seventh year of the Trojan War, but the focus is on folly, not grandeur.</p>
        <p>The lovers of the title are more selfish than noble, more randy than pure of heart. And as for the military adversaries, the Greek officers are bored and self-involved and basically can't stand one another; the Trojans are war weary; and their royal family (Priam and his sons, including the great warrior Hector, the priapic Paris and the whimsically passionate Troilus) is divided about whether the war is worth perpetuating. All may be fair in love and war, but none of it, in this play, is admirable.</p>

        <p>One of Shakespeare's most linguistically sophisticated plays, and also one of his most bitterly satirical, ''Troilus and Cressida'' is a sort of backstage drama, a tale of the bickering and backbiting that fester behind public presentation. It's a love story set during the seventh year of the Trojan War, but the focus is on folly, not grandeur.</p>
        <p>The lovers of the title are more selfish than noble, more randy than pure of heart. And as for the military adversaries, the Greek officers are bored and self-involved and basically can't stand one another; the Trojans are war weary; and their royal family (Priam and his sons, including the great warrior Hector, the priapic Paris and the whimsically passionate Troilus) is divided about whether the war is worth perpetuating. All may be fair in love and war, but none of it, in this play, is admirable.</p>
        <p>There's no real protagonist. The clearest perspective belongs to Thersites, a vulgar, unkempt, invective-spewing slave who serves as a mocking chorus and finds everyone, not without reason, contemptible. And it all takes place during a hiatus in battle, at a time when Troilus and Cressida have a brief, consummating encounter and are then forcibly separated, so very little loving or fighting actually goes on.</p>
        <p>It is a play in which rhetoric of a particularly convoluted and densely clever stripe is the star. A new production of it by the Off Broadway company Theater for a New Audience opened yesterday at the American Place Theater. The director is Peter Hall, a British theater icon who, among a long list of achievements, founded the Royal Shakespeare Company and who last October directed John Barton's 10-hour epic, ''Tantalus,'' which also deals with the Trojan War.</p>
        <p>Sir Peter is, by his own confession, dedicated to Shakespeare's language: the disciplined delivery of its poetics. He has said as well that he approaches a production without an overall concept and lets the rehearsal process and the actors determine the show's tone and direction. It is an idealistic approach that expresses utter confidence in the theater's collaborative creative process. But in this case it has generated a sluggish, unilluminating production of a play that begs for the kind of momentum and clarity that a propulsive directorial hand can provide.</p>
        <p>Performed here in the round, on a stage turned into a sandbox, the play opens with its most stirring imagery: two skeletons swathed in rags and propped against each other as if rotting after a beach picnic, and two others in a stark, coital embrace, a chilling depiction of Shakespeare's bile-filled connection between lust and battle. But it is merely an admonitory prologue. The skeletons are swept off by the grimy Thersites (Andrew Weems), and the stage is left clear for the static gatherings and the verbal proclamations and manipulations that hold sway in each of the opposing military camps.</p>
        <p>In spite of a relentless parade of entrances and exits and a couple of gymnastic fight scenes toward the end, the production is thick-limbed and trudging; it never burrows from under the self-deluding and often overwrought bloviations of characters for whom self-importance knows no bounds. It is both Shakespeare's genius and Shakespeare's joke that they express themselves with some of the knottiest verbiage in any of his plays: ''Princes,'' begins Agamemnon, addressing his high command in an attempt to rouse their flagging enthusiasm for the war,</p>
        <p>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?</p>
        <p>The ample proposition that hope makes</p>
        <p>In all designs begun on earth below</p>
        <p>Fails in the promised largeness. Checks and disasters</p>
        <p>Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,</p>
        <p>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</p>
        <p>Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain</p>
        <p>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</p>
        <p>It's the kind of writing that winks at its own erudition and almost willfully obscures the plot, which can be summarized this way:</p>
        <p>Troilus and Cressida, mutual admirers from afar, are brought together by Pandarus, Cressida's uncle, a half-Cupid, half-pimp who encourages their sexual union. None are aware, however, that Cressida's father, Calchas, who has defected to the Greeks, has arranged for his daughter to be given to the Greek officer Diomedes in exchange for a captured Trojan.</p>
        <p>In the meantime the Greeks are particularly fed up with their indolent and scornful warrior, Achilles, whose sexually diverse predilections seem to lay foremost claim to his loyalty. So the other officers agree to a plan devised by the clever and officious Ulysses, meant to lure Achilles back to battle by lionizing instead an inferior man, Ajax.</p>
        <p>The Trojans, meanwhile, are clearly irritated that years of bloody torment and deprivation have resulted from the capture of Helen, and the question is on the table: Is Paris's lust for a trollopy beauty really an appropriate symbol of the pride of Ilium, worth defending at all costs? As Hector declares at one point, ''Let Helen go.'' In the end, all weaknesses are indulged and promises broken, naturally to gruesome effect: heartbreak, death, the ruination of Troy, the blackened soul of Greece.</p>
        <p>Sir Peter's essentially laissez-faire staging leaves the actors to create the peaks and valleys of drama, but this is an ensemble that remains unbonded and uncohesive, and though most in the large cast cope reasonably with Shakespearean poetics, few manage to act distinctively as well. (The costumes don't help; the Greeks in particular look like some shabby medieval motorcycle gang.)</p>
        <p>Idris Elba, as Achilles, with an ever-present wine goblet in his hand and a controlling arm often around his doting companion, Patroclus, does have the swagger to convey both his physical prowess and his graceless egomania. And Terence Rigby, as Agamemnon, does a subtle turn as a commander who is sick of his job, leading by spiritless habit. Mr. Weems's Thersites is pugnacious and bravely unpleasant, though he's not the most gleeful or humorous name-caller.</p>
        <p>Other performances in major roles, however, are deadening. Philip Goodwin's Ulysses is completely opaque. Tony Church, as Pandarus, works awfully hard to create a sullied charm that never emerges. And in the title roles, Joey Kern and Tricia Paoluccio both have the looks and the actorly command to be featured on ''Dawson's Creek.''</p>
