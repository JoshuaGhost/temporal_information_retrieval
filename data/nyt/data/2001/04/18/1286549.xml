        <p>The price of Manhattan apartments rose by an average of 19 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to a report released yesterday by the real estate firm Douglas Elliman. The firm reported that the average price of apartments below 116th Street was $876,612. However, the report found apartments staying on the market an average of 137 days, up 28 percent from a year ago. Susan Renfrew, the firm's director of sales on the East Side, attributed the continuing price increases to a dearth of available apartments.</p>
