        <p>SEVERAL years ago, Bern's Steak House changed its wine list. ''The old one was getting a little unwieldy,'' said David Laxer, who runs the place.</p>
        <p>Unwieldy? Perhaps, but what did they expect from a book with 2,500 pages? The new list, at a meager 179 pages, looks almost anorexic.</p>

        <p>SEVERAL years ago, Bern's Steak House changed its wine list. ''The old one was getting a little unwieldy,'' said David Laxer, who runs the place.</p>
        <p>Unwieldy? Perhaps, but what did they expect from a book with 2,500 pages? The new list, at a meager 179 pages, looks almost anorexic.</p>
        <p>Legendary is one of the most overworked words in the language, but few others I can think of so well describe this windowless, bunkerlike eatery just up the street from Tampa Bay. I first heard of Bern's in 1984, while briefly covering Walter F. Mondale's presidential campaign. ''Just one more stop,'' his handlers promised, and we'd be off to Tampa ''for the best steak dinner ever.'' But the last speech went on forever, and when we got to Tampa, Bern's was closed. Several times in the years that followed, I tried to get to Bern's, but whenever I was in Tampa, the place was full.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I kept hearing how extraordinary it was. Didn't they claim to have half a million bottles of wine on hand? More than any other restaurant in the world? I know of a group of New York fans who spend $10,000 or $12,000 over a weekend on Bern's wines.</p>
        <p>Clearly, I had an obligation, moral and professional, to see -- and maybe sample a bit -- for myself. A couple of weeks ago I decided the time had come. It was never going to happen as part of some other trip; it would have to be a trip to Bern's and nowhere else. I called Ken Collura, the head sommelier -- this was no time for the anonymous critic routine -- and two days later I presented myself.</p>
        <p>''We do things differently here,'' the menu declares. This is a gem of understatement. To begin, there is the beef. There are 50 styles of steak fashioned from six cuts: filet mignon, chateaubriand, strip sirloin, Delmonico, porterhouse and T-bone. But that's only the beginning. Like your steak rare? Bern's will grill it very rare no crust, very rare with crust, rare cold center, rare warm center and, of course, medium-rare. Strip sirloin comes in 17 sizes, from 8 ounces to 60, and in seven thicknesses from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.</p>
        <p>Most guests -- and there can be 1,000 on a busy night -- are stunned by the menu's three pages of steak-eating fine print and meekly allow the waiters to guide them. Some waiter tips: for medium-well or well done, order thin steaks. There's less shrinkage. For two or more, order a single steak. Half a 16-ounce steak is juicier than a single 8-ouncer.</p>
        <p>Steak is Bern's raison d'être, but there is also lamb, veal, buffalo and chicken. Three 1,200-gallon tanks in the kitchen each hold 650 pounds of grouper, pompano, snapper and Key West grunt that swim right up to dinnertime -- yours. There are more than 20 kinds of caviar.</p>
        <p>Bern's has eight dining rooms, most with some nominal wine theme. The Burgundy Room features a 30-foot map of the Côte d'Or with almost all its vineyards shown in tiny detail. The Champagne Room doesn't have much to do with its namesake but is, we were told with awe, where George Steinbrenner sits. The Tchelistcheff Room, actually the best looking, features photos of the oenologist André Tchelistcheff, a friend of Bern Laxer, David's father and the creator of this astonishing place.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Laxer, now 77, was born and raised in New York, the son of immigrants. After graduating from New York University, Bern took his new wife, Gertrude, to Florida where they promptly ran out of money. He worked in a cigar factory for a time, wrote advertising for a men's clothing store and published a newsletter for gardeners.</p>
        <p>Then, in 1953, with $1,400 saved up, the Laxers opened a coffee shop, Bern &amp; Gert's Little Midway, in Tampa's business district. It was a hit. They found a larger place. Called Beer Haven, it was where the steakhouse now stands. By removing some letters from the sign and adding a couple, they came up with ''Bern's.'' ''All they had to buy was the apostrophe and the S,'' Dave Laxer said proudly.</p>
        <p>They added ''Steak House'' when the telephone company refused a single first name as a listing.</p>
        <p>Bern's Steak House prospered. ''Hard work and my father's inspired advertising,'' Dave Laxer said. Bern, who had studied advertising at N.Y.U., ran dozens of painfully corny local ads, like one that said: ''Steak Dinner, $66,000. Includes African safari and a good luck charm. Steak dinner alone: $2.50.''</p>
        <p>Almost from its beginning, in 1956, Bern's had served liquor. Because of peculiarities in Florida's liquor laws, Mr. Laxer discovered that owning a liquor store license would give him more flexibility. He bought a store and found its small selection of wines. ''He fell in love with wine,'' his son said. ''He started buying and wouldn't -- or couldn't -- stop.''</p>
        <p>Today, Bern's Steak House claims to have the largest wine cellar in the world, over half a million bottles. ''We keep about 100,000 bottles here in the restaurant,'' Mr. Collura said, ''but they represent only about a fifth of our stock. We have four warehouses in the neighborhood, each with about 100,000 bottles.''</p>
        <p>The collection is astonishing in its depth. There are 38 vintages of Château Mouton-Rothschild, beginning with 1901. Château Latour goes back to 1920, Château Lafite-Rothschild to 1881. There are Musignys from 1949, Bonnes Mares from 1933 and 21 vintages of Romanée-Conti from the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti beginning with 1952. And most of the prices are easily 10 to 15 percent lower than you would pay anywhere else in the country.</p>
        <p>These wine selections are from the current 179-page list, the 48th edition of the Bern's catalog, printed up last August. The scaled-down wine list was one of he few noticeable changes made after Bern Laxer was severely injured in an automobile accident driving from the restaurant to his home one night in 1993. He never fully recovered and now lives quietly at his home in Tampa.</p>
        <p>''I was working in a bank in Atlanta when the call came,'' Dave Laxer said. ''I took over then and have been here since. This is a family business, and it's where I should be.''</p>
        <p>There are 320 seats in Bern's eight dining rooms. When they order dinner, guests are ''invited'' to have dessert upstairs in the Harry Waugh Room. Most do. Larger than the other dining rooms combined, the dessert room is divided into 48 smaller, glass-enclosed rooms seating two to eight. Harry Waugh, by the way, is an English wine merchant who gave Bern Laxer the idea for the dessert room when, after dinner at his London home in the early 1970's, he invited the Laxers into a drawing room for coffee and brandy. The Harry Waugh Room also clears the dining rooms for more sittings.</p>
        <p>A separate dessert menu lists some 15 different coffees, 30 desserts and 600 after-dinner drinks, There are about 200 Cognacs, priced from $6 for a glass of Bisquit VSOP to $6,100 for a bottle of 1789 Fine Champagne from A. L. Boiteau &amp; Company. There are over 200 Scotches, from $5.50 for a glass of 12-year-old Glentromie to $2,420 for a bottle of 37-year-old Macallan-Glenlivit.</p>
        <p>Château d'Yquem goes back to 1933, the vintage ports to 1957, and Madeiras to 1792. Port prices are low; a 1963 da Silva Five Crown is $299 a bottle, a 1977 Ferreira is $110. There are several hundred ports.</p>
        <p>The wine and spirits collection is truly staggering. But, for the life of me, I don't know who drinks it all. Wine connoisseurs from all over make pilgrimages to Bern's. Even so, on a busy Saturday recently, less than half the diners appeared to be drinking wine.</p>
