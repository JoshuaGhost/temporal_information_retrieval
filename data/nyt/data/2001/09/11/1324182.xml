        <p>Editorial says that with sinking economy, disappearing surplus and tottering budget, Republicans are going back to drawing board; says some Republicans are urging more budget cuts, which is bad idea; says this is no time to cut more spending on programs of vital importance to most vulnerable Americans</p>

        <p>The summer has barely ended, but President Bush and his Congressional allies are already frantically rewriting their script for the fall. This was supposed to be a season for Mr. Bush to talk about ''values,'' not fiscal policy. But with a sinking economy, evanescing surplus and tottering budget, Republicans are going back to the drawing board. Some, like Trent Lott, the Senate minority leader, want to cut the capital gains tax. House Republicans are talking about broad spending cuts. The White House says Mr. Bush would listen to these and other ideas to revive the economy. There is a whiff of panic in the air, and panic can lead to bad policy.</p>
        <p>That many Republicans are now rallying around a cut in the capital gains tax (from 20 to 15 percent) is a particular sign of desperation. After ramming through one of the most unfair tax cuts in history, one that targeted most of its benefits to the most wealthy taxpayers, the party is focusing on a new reduction that would lavish 80 percent of its benefit on the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers. A capital gains tax cut would not stimulate the economy in the short term, the most pressing economic need. While perhaps providing a quick infusion of revenue in the next year, as stockholders sold off shares to take advantage of the new rates, it would deepen the nation's long-term fiscal hole. The only thing to recommend it is that it would reward party fund-raisers and benefactors.</p>

        <p>The summer has barely ended, but President Bush and his Congressional allies are already frantically rewriting their script for the fall. This was supposed to be a season for Mr. Bush to talk about ''values,'' not fiscal policy. But with a sinking economy, evanescing surplus and tottering budget, Republicans are going back to the drawing board. Some, like Trent Lott, the Senate minority leader, want to cut the capital gains tax. House Republicans are talking about broad spending cuts. The White House says Mr. Bush would listen to these and other ideas to revive the economy. There is a whiff of panic in the air, and panic can lead to bad policy.</p>
        <p>That many Republicans are now rallying around a cut in the capital gains tax (from 20 to 15 percent) is a particular sign of desperation. After ramming through one of the most unfair tax cuts in history, one that targeted most of its benefits to the most wealthy taxpayers, the party is focusing on a new reduction that would lavish 80 percent of its benefit on the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers. A capital gains tax cut would not stimulate the economy in the short term, the most pressing economic need. While perhaps providing a quick infusion of revenue in the next year, as stockholders sold off shares to take advantage of the new rates, it would deepen the nation's long-term fiscal hole. The only thing to recommend it is that it would reward party fund-raisers and benefactors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his economic advisers have until now resisted capital gains tax-cut proposals. During the campaign, Lawrence Lindsey, now the chief economic counselor, dismissed the idea as redolent of old Republican economic thinking, and not acceptable to the ''compassionate conservative'' philosophy of Mr. Bush. But that was then. Now the White House is saying it might be interested. It will be a hard sell politically, especially since the only way to pay for such a tax cut would be to siphon off even more of the Social Security revenues that Mr. Bush once said were inviolable.</p>
        <p>To help Mr. Bush keep his promise not to touch Social Security funds, some Republicans are urging another bad idea: more budget cuts. Today the House will begin taking up a nutty scheme to ''sequester'' spending -- that is, cut spending -- in non-defense areas next year in order to avoid tapping Social Security money this year. This gimmick turns Keynesianism on its head. If an economic downturn invites a stimulative fiscal policy by cutting taxes, surely such an approach would be completely undermined by a parallel policy of cutting spending. Hard as a capital gains tax cut is to justify, it is even more unacceptable to finance it by cutting spending on health, children's nutrition and education -- the latter being the very priority that Mr. Bush set aside the week to promote in his new ''values'' agenda.</p>
        <p>Democrats are saying privately that they might accept some sort of tax reduction provided the Bush administration is willing, in turn, to repeal  part of the previously enacted tax cut that takes place several years from now. In theory, that may make sense. Democrats are also floating the idea of a tax cut that, this time, would go to lower-income taxpayers who got nothing out of the last package by giving them some sort of a credit for Social Security and Medicare taxes. One measure of Mr. Lott's eagerness for a capital gains tax cut is that yesterday he said he would consider adding the Democratic proposal to it.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, this is no time for cutting more taxes on the wealthy and cutting more spending on programs of vital importance to the most vulnerable Americans. Republicans are right about the need to rewrite their script. But the revisions they are clutching at now would make a bad plot even more implausible.</p>
