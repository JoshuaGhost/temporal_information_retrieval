        <p>Déjà Vu  Schopenhauer (1788-1860) called it sublime. The writer Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) called it a ''vain 5-cent candle.'' They were both referring to the moon, and in the mid-18th century poets like Goethe and German Romantic artists like Caspar David Friedrich were among the many fascinated and inspired by it. From today through Nov. 11,  three variations of a famous moonwatching composition by Friedrich (1774-1840) will be shown together for the first time in ''Caspar David Friedrich: Moonwatchers,'' an exhibition of 17 paintings and 2 works on paper at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The first Friedrich version, ''Two Men Contemplating the Moon'' (1819), is on loan from Dresden; the second, ''Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon'' (circa 1824), is on loan from Berlin; and the third, ''Two Men Contemplating the Moon'' (circa 1830), was bought by the museum last year.</p>

        <p>Art of Devotion  Around 1300 work began in a monastery in Gladzor on the illuminated miniatures of an ambitious Gospel. Starting today, in commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Church, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles is devoting an exhibition, ''The Armenian Gospels of Gladzor,'' to that rare manuscript, on loan from the University of California at Los Angeles, on view through Dec. 2.</p>
        <p>Bowing Out  James Conlon announced today that he would leave the Paris Opera when his contract as chief conductor ends in the summer of 2004. ''I feel that by 2004, which will mark the end of nine seasons, it will be time both for me and for the Paris Opera to look forward to something new,'' Mr. Conlon said in a statement. Since 1995, he has vastly increased the opera's performance schedule, offering stagings of works by Debussy, Offenbach and others that are new to Paris.</p>
        <p>Ecstasy  Regarded as the last grand master of Qawwali, the devotional music of Sufi Muslims, Munshi Raziuddin, 90, is to perform with Farid Ayaz Qawwal and Brothers on Saturday night at 8 at Alice Tully Hall. Traceable to the 10th century, Qawwali drew from Arabic, Persian and South Asian languages and musical influences to blossom in its present form in the 13th century. The songs, extolling spiritual ecstasy, are characterized by soaring vocal improvisations, incantatory refrains, steady hand clapping and surges of tabla playing.</p>
