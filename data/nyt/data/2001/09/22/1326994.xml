      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Britain suspended Northern Ireland's three-year-old government tonight and reinstated direct rule from London for the second time in two months, to forestall yet another crisis over the fulfillment of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.</p>
        <p>The decision by Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid puts the province's Parliament on hold indefinitely, though the first suspension lasted only a day.</p>
        <p>It also starts a six-week review period that Mr. Reid hopes will be enough time for politicians to resolve two issues that have paralyzed the region for months: disarming paramilitary groups, in particular the Irish Republican Army, and reforming the police force.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, the two largest Protestant parties, the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionists, reversed their long-standing opposition to the police reforms by appointing members to the board that would oversee such issues as changing the name, uniform and recruiting policies of the North Ireland police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
        <p>Only Sinn Fein, the political party of the I.R.A., still refuses to endorse the police reforms, saying they do not do enough to encourage Roman Catholics to join the force. The Social Democratic and Labor Party, a moderate Catholic group, endorsed the new police service last month -- an important step, since the R.U.C. has traditionally been seen as an instrument of British rule.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the I.R.A. offered to resume contact with the international panel that is supervising disarmament. New contact with the commission, led by Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, is a minor step. In August, the I.R.A. offered a specific plan for dismantling its arsenal of guns and plastic explosives -- an essential step in the process. But it withdrew the plan and has not mentioned it again.</p>
        <p>The latest suspension of the government will give the I.R.A. time to work with General de Chastelain's  panel, but it will cause political strife. Hard-line Unionists, who favor increased political ties between Northern Ireland and Britain, are angry about the I.R.A.'s failure to disarm and are pushing their politicians to withdraw from the Assembly entirely, which would cause the institutions to collapse.</p>
        <p>Referring to Mr. Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said, ''If he is going to try and repeat that operation, then it is necessary for him to show that there is something going to be achieved. Simply to prolong the situation for six weeks in the hope that something would turn up is a mistake.''</p>
