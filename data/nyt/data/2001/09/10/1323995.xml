        <p>Shares of companies with numbers in their names are among those that have fallen sharply, sometimes to near or below that number (S)</p>

        <p>What's in a name? Maybe a stock price forecast.</p>
        <p>There was a time when getting a number into a company name seemed like a clever way to differentiate a company from the crowd.  Level 3 Communications, for example, traded as high as $132 a share. Now the telecommunications company is about, true to its name, $3.</p>

        <p>What's in a name? Maybe a stock price forecast.</p>
        <p>There was a time when getting a number into a company name seemed like a clever way to differentiate a company from the crowd.  Level 3 Communications, for example, traded as high as $132 a share. Now the telecommunications company is about, true to its name, $3.</p>
        <p>At that price, it is close to the value of 3Com, the once high-flying technology company that now trades for $3 and change.</p>
        <p>Then there is NetZero, an Internet access company. Rounded to the nearest dollar, its shares, once at $40, now are worth, namely, zero.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, alas, a name can turn out to be too optimistic. Level 8 Systems, a software company that fetched nearly $50 at its peak, had fallen to $8 by late last year. But that did not prove to be the bottom. Now it trades for about $2. No plans have been announced for a name change.</p>
        <p>Then there is Take Two Interactive Software , a video game company. Its shares, which soared as high as $24.50 this summer on hopes for its new Max Payne game, have since fallen back to about $13. But the Take Two shares still have room to fall before truly justifying the name.</p>
