        <p>A freak hand like the one West held in the diagramed deal at the Eastern Regional Championships is of course rare: 8-5-0-0 occurs once in 31,000 deals. It is also rarely interesting in terms of play, but this was an exception. Would you choose to play or defend six diamonds as South?</p>

        <p>A freak hand like the one West held in the diagramed deal at the Eastern Regional Championships is of course rare: 8-5-0-0 occurs once in 31,000 deals. It is also rarely interesting in terms of play, but this was an exception. Would you choose to play or defend six diamonds as South?</p>
        <p>Suppose that two rounds of hearts are led. South ruffs, plays a club to dummy's king, and leads the diamond 10 for a finesse. Trumps are drawn, and cashing two more diamonds produces this ending:</p>
        <p>When the last trump is led, the club eight is thrown from dummy. This traps East in a crisscross squeeze. Whichever suit he discards, South will play.</p>
        <p>South was Emily Seiden of Manhattan, and whether she would have found this brilliant play will never be known. In real life the West player, John Rengstorff, bid six hearts over six diamonds and went down one.</p>
        <p>It might appear that he was right, but in theory he was wrong. Six diamonds can be defeated if West is inspired to shift to a spade at the second trick, destroying the potential squeeze.</p>
        <p>So you should choose to defend six diamonds.</p>
