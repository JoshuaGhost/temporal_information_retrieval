        <p>The past several days have been, despite the agony, among America's finest. New York's remarkable response to the catastrophic attack at the World Trade Center has been well documented.

        <p>Americans turned on their televisions last Thursday night and watched as George W. Bush, in the nation's hour of need, delivered a near-perfect speech. With the obscene toll of those lost in downtown Manhattan climbing above 6,000, and with hysterical rumors circulating about imminent additional attacks, Mr. Bush went before a joint meeting of Congress and somehow got things exactly right.</p>

        <p>The past several days have been, despite the agony, among America's finest. New York's remarkable response to the catastrophic attack at the World Trade Center has been well documented. But also, above the tragic din, at the very highest levels of government, have come the essential voices of sanity.</p>
        <p>Americans turned on their televisions last Thursday night and watched as George W. Bush, in the nation's hour of need, delivered a near-perfect speech. With the obscene toll of those lost in downtown Manhattan climbing above 6,000, and with hysterical rumors circulating about imminent additional attacks, Mr. Bush went before a joint meeting of Congress and somehow got things exactly right.</p>
        <p>He dispensed with the cowboy-in-the-saloon rhetoric. There was no bombast in the speech, no cries of wanted dead or alive, just a perfectly modulated sense of absolute resolve.</p>
        <p>''After all that has just passed,'' he said, ''all the lives taken and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead and dangers to face.</p>
        <p>''But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror. This will be an age of liberty here and across the world.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Bush, who seldom wanders into the precincts of eloquence, it was a splendid moment. He expressed the collective anger of the nation, declared that the U.S. would mount a sustained global assault against terrorism, and bolstered the sense of national unity that flowered in the aftermath of the attack.</p>
        <p>And he did that while assuring the world that it is not the Muslim people who are the enemies of America, but the terrorists who have perverted the tenets of a proud religion, and also the regimes that give them sanctuary.</p>
        <p>That tone was maintained yesterday by Secretary of State Colin Powell during an interview on ''Meet the Press.'' Choosing his words carefully in a volatile atmosphere that included serious talk about the possibility of a world war, Mr. Powell said: ''Let's not assume there will be a large-scale war. I don't know that we should even consider a large-scale war of the conventional type.''</p>
        <p>It was important, said Mr. Powell, to follow the president's lead. ''The objective that the president has focused on in this first instance is Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden [and] his presence in Afghanistan. And then we will consider all other options and all other sources of terrorist activity and go after it in an appropriate way.''</p>
        <p>Common sense should tell you it would not be wise in the coming weeks to be hanging out with the Taliban. But Mr. Bush and Mr. Powell have also made it abundantly clear that the U.S. will not be able to bomb the terrorists into submission. The president was wise to ask for patience as more complex responses are fashioned. Provoking a wide and futile war would be as insane as the attack on the trade center.</p>
        <p>The president and the secretary of state have shown, so far, that the United States is as shrewd and intelligent as it is powerful. A successful fight against terrorism will require international cooperation and the continued unity of the American people. Neither of those elements can be maintained if the U.S. is seen as waging war on innocents abroad.</p>
        <p>If it turns out that we are to engage in a large-scale war, then the nation is being prepared in an odd way. Toward the end of yesterday's interview, Secretary Powell said: ''We've got to get back to work. We've got to get back to our ballgames. We've got to get back to our theaters. We've got to get this economy moving again. And that will be the best answer to what happened.''</p>
        <p>The citizens of a nation on the verge of a major global conflict are not generally counseled to run out and pick up theater tickets. The campaign against terrorism will be ugly, brutish and by no means short. But such a campaign is a far cry from a world at war.</p>
        <p>Targeting terrorists rather than innocents will be the key to success as the U.S. and its allies respond to the savage events of Sept. 11. If that is done well, a wider war can be avoided and Americans may have reason to hope that the worst is actually behind them.</p>
