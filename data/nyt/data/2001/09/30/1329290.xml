        <p>Martha Bayles letter defends B R Myers, subject of Judith Shulevitz's September 9 The Close Reader column</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>This is a critique of a critique of a critique. First B. R. Myers inveighed against the sorry state of American literary fiction. Then Judith Shulevitz inveighed against Myers. I am writing to defend Myers. He wrote a terrific polemic, and Shulevitz doesn't lay a glove on him.</p>
        <p>First of all, why is Myers ''an unknown,'' as Shulevitz calls him, and Shulevitz not? I, for instance, know neither one of them. Second, what makes Myers (in Shulevitz's words) ''foreign . . . in every way'' to the American literary establishment? His command of the relevant knowledge -- i.e., the English-language prose tradition -- seems adequate to the task of evaluation he sets for himself. Third, Myers possesses both a sharp ear and a dry sense of humor; to accuse him of lacking these is plain hogwash. Fourth, instead of belittling his credentials as a critic, perhaps Shulevitz should have spent a paragraph or two defending the authors he attacks. For the most part she concedes his points. And in the one instance where she does not -- Don DeLillo -- her corrections are far too picayune to undermine Myers's case.</p>
        <p>For the rest, all that Shulevitz does is place another wreath on Dwight Macdonald's ''Masscult &amp; Midcult'' (has anyone read that incoherent essay lately?) and close with just the sort of generic enthusiasm Myers so aptly skewers. ''We can roll our eyes at our writers, we can laugh at their moments of baroqueness and vulgarity, but we also get to love them,'' she writes. Gee, if we love 'em, then who is this foreign guy to knock 'em? This is American lit, pal. Love it or leave it.</p>
