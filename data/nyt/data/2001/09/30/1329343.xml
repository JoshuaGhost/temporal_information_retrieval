        <p>On a day when countless children in America lost their fathers, the rest of us started searching for a father, too. When a nation is under siege, it wants someone to tell us what to do, to protect us from bullies, to tell us that everything's O.K. and that it's safe to go home now. It's an impulse, perhaps, that we never outgrow. But as we've learned this month, the definition of what constitutes a plausible national father at a time of tragedy is as much in flux in the 21st century as the definition of war. F.D.R. and Churchill -- the patriarchs who served Western civilization during the greatest international conflagration of living memory -- projected a patrician, if not Victorian, authority that might not play today even if we had leaders who could match their eloquence. For that matter, our nation has become so much larger and complex since World War II that one size of national dad may no longer fit all. In a matter of days, we've gone through several.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 11, when the father figure we instinctively turn to, the president, was largely out of sight, we had to draft a new national dad, at least temporarily, and so we gravitated to the obvious stand-ins: the network anchormen. The anchormen -- and yes, even at this late date, it's still a men's club at broadcasting's big three -- took charge just as we might have hoped. All three of them are older than the president, than most Americans who were watching and, in all likelihood, than the shadowy enemy. All three projected calm and omniscience even if they possessed neither. But before we could figure out which of the trio would emerge as first among equals -- as, say, Walter Cronkite did during the Kennedy assassination -- they were usurped by Rudolph Giuliani.</p>

For that matter, our nation has become so much larger and complex since World War II that one size of national dad may no longer fit all. In a matter of days, we've gone through several.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 11, when the father figure we instinctively turn to, the president, was largely out of sight, we had to draft a new national dad, at least temporarily, and so we gravitated to the obvious stand-ins: the network anchormen. The anchormen -- and yes, even at this late date, it's still a men's club at broadcasting's big three -- took charge just as we might have hoped. All three of them are older than the president, than most Americans who were watching and, in all likelihood, than the shadowy enemy. All three projected calm and omniscience even if they possessed neither. But before we could figure out which of the trio would emerge as first among equals -- as, say, Walter Cronkite did during the Kennedy assassination -- they were usurped by Rudolph Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, the mayor of New York had often seemed to his constituents the kind of father many of us despise: punitive, withholding, petty, cold. Yet at ground zero, he projected comfort as well as authority, tenderness as well as steeliness. In the midst of performing round-the-clock triage on a grievously wounded city, he even found the time to honor a commitment to attend a wedding and serve as an honorary father of the bride, in a tux no less, to the sister of a New York fireman who had died on duty in August.</p>
        <p>Once the president tardily re-emerged, he had no choice but to play catch-up and transform himself A.S.A.P. from absent father to Superdad, circa 2001. You had to feel for him. As those of us in his boomer generation know -- especially those of us who have raised teenagers -- it's no longer easy for a father to lay down the law (if it ever was). George W. Bush had to do exactly that with Osama bin Laden, but with his fellow citizens he had to be more Oprahfied -- or, as we might say now, more Rudied. Bush struggled mightily at first to find the balance. And so arrived this very strange sentence delivered to the nation from the Oval Office: ''I'm a loving guy, and I am also someone, however, who's got a job to do.'' In other words, he was at once a dad who hugs the kids -- as he would subsequently instruct the nation to do in his take-charge address to Congress -- and Gary Cooper at high noon. Then he welled up with tears -- as Dan Rather would, to overflowing, in his comparable updating of the anchor's paternal persona on the Letterman show a few days later.</p>
        <p>Once Bush emerged as both a tough and tender dad, the press began to praise him for ''finding his voice.'' At that point it became safe for Dick Cheney to re-emerge from hiding -- first on ''Meet the Press'' and then by the president's side. Cheney is only five years older than his boss, but his reticence, his unapologetic inability to express any kind of emotion in public and clinical appetite for the standard lexicon of war seem to hail from two or three generations earlier. He makes Major Dad look like a wimp, and he could be the administration's alternative dad for those unreconstructed Americans who have no patience with fathers who talk about how ''loving'' they are at a time of war.</p>
        <p>For those who are still searching, there remains George H. W. Bush, who, at the National Cathedral memorial service, extended his arm across his wife to put a reassuring hand on his solemn son's arm. It doesn't hurt a traumatized nation to see that the nation's dad has a dad of his own in reserve.</p>
