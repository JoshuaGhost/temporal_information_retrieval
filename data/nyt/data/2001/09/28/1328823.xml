        <p>On Sept. 11 the Asia Society was a month away from moving into expanded headquarters at 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street. Invitations for the opening party had been sent; the construction crew was working around the clock to finish the building, and some of the the art for the inaugural exhibitions was en route by air.</p>
        <p>''Then the whole world stopped,'' said Vishakha N. Desai, senior vice president of the society and director of its museum and cultural programs. Some of the construction workers, many of whom came from New Jersey, could not get into the city because the bridges and tunnels were at first closed and later clogged. Those who could travel rushed to the World Trade Center to join the emergency crews. The work of Nilima Sheikh, a leading Indian artist, was on its way from India, and the plane was diverted to the United Arab Emirates. ''No one had any idea when the plane would be allowed to leave the U.A.E. because all foreign cargo shipments were banned indefinitely,'' Ms. Desai said. Other foreign shipments could not leave because of a ban on cargo. They all finally arrived last Friday.</p>

        <p>On Sept. 11 the Asia Society was a month away from moving into expanded headquarters at 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street. Invitations for the opening party had been sent; the construction crew was working around the clock to finish the building, and some of the the art for the inaugural exhibitions was en route by air.</p>
        <p>''Then the whole world stopped,'' said Vishakha N. Desai, senior vice president of the society and director of its museum and cultural programs. Some of the construction workers, many of whom came from New Jersey, could not get into the city because the bridges and tunnels were at first closed and later clogged. Those who could travel rushed to the World Trade Center to join the emergency crews. The work of Nilima Sheikh, a leading Indian artist, was on its way from India, and the plane was diverted to the United Arab Emirates. ''No one had any idea when the plane would be allowed to leave the U.A.E. because all foreign cargo shipments were banned indefinitely,'' Ms. Desai said. Other foreign shipments could not leave because of a ban on cargo. They all finally arrived last Friday.</p>
        <p>There were simpler problems, too, like the bamboo flooring that was coming from Chicago. Since all the airports in the New York area were closed in the days after the terrorist attack, the flooring could not get to New York in time, and without it, the building could not be finished.</p>
        <p>Then there was perhaps the worst snag of all: the Manhattan office of the City Building Department was closed, so the society could not obtain occupancy permits to open the premises.</p>
        <p>With too much precious time lost, the society decided to move its opening to Nov. 17. ''It wasn't an easy decision,'' Ms. Desai said.</p>
        <p>When she looked at the invitation, she got chills, she said. It showed the silhouette of two towerlike configurations in silver against a gold background, outlines of a contemporary Japanese screen, which eerily resembled the twin towers.</p>
        <p>''After the shock. After having been stunned, we began to realize that what we are trying to do becomes more important than ever,'' she said. One show, ''Conversations With Traditions,'' the work of Ms. Sheikh and Shahzia Sikander, a Pakistani artist living in New York, deals with the barriers between India and Pakistan and the notion of what it means to be an American.</p>
        <p>''That's a very potent topic right now,'' Ms. Desai said. ''We're also doing a performance of a contemporary chamber opera composed by a a Chinese-American artist, Jason Kao Hwang, that deals with the immigrant stories of Chinatown, where the whole issue of cultural diversity becomes even more poignant.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''The artists are all seeing their work in a new light. It's made us realize that what we do is not a luxury; it has real urgency.''</p>
        <p>Russian Books</p>
        <p>This week the Museum of Modern Art announced receiving a gift of more than 1,000 Russian avant-garde illustrated books from the New York-based Judith Rothschild Foundation. It is the largest donation to the museum's department of prints and illustrated books since Abby Aldrich Rockefeller established the collection in the 1940's with her gift of 1,600 prints by European and American artists.</p>
        <p>''Judith Rothschild was particularly interested in Russian avant-garde art and books,'' said Deborah Wye, the Modern's chief curator of prints and illustrated books. ''About three and a half years ago the foundation's trustee, Harvey S. Shipley Miller, began collecting books from the Russian avant-garde, realizing that this medium played a fundamental role in the art of this period.''</p>
        <p>Over the years the foundation put together the world's most comprehensive collection of Russian avant-garde books, always with an eye toward donating them to an institution. Mr. Miller chose the Modern, Ms. Wye said, because it has a vast collection of Russian avant-garde art -- about 395 works in all areas, everything from paintings and sculptures to photography, design and film.</p>
        <p>The collection represents all the significant artistic developments of the Russian avant-garde and includes the work of major artists like Kazimir Malevich, Olga Rozanova, Natalya Goncharova, El Lissitzky and Aleksandr Rodchenko. The collection also includes children's books and Judaica.</p>
        <p>To celebrate the gift, the museum is organizing an exhibition, ''The Russian Avant-Garde Book: 1910-1934,'' which will run from March 21 to May 21. It will be the last exhibition to open at the museum before it closes for its major renovation and expansion. ''We're going to try to show the public these books in an inventive way, using computer animation and innovative displays,'' Ms. Wye said. ''There will also be a reading area with facsimile copies of some of the most important titles.''</p>
        <p>Search for Space</p>
        <p>With all nonmilitary activities halted at armories across the state, organizers of art and antiques shows have been scrambling to find new quarters.  Irene Stella has moved the Gramercy Park Modern, which is next weekend, to Madison Square Garden. It had been planned for the 69th Regiment Armory at 26th Street and Lexington Avenue. Now she is trying to find homes for some of her other events.</p>
        <p>''The Gramercy Park Antique Textile and Design Show is possibly going to Madison Square Garden; we're not sure yet,'' she said. ''If not, we will have it in one of three raw spaces we've looked at.'' That show is scheduled for Oct. 19 to 21.</p>
        <p>''My next worry is the Triple Pier Show,'' Ms. Stella added. ''Since the piers have been closed off for emergency services, they will no longer be available.'' The event, which includes 1,100 exhibitors and gets around 15,000 visitors, is scheduled for Nov. 10, 11, 17 and 18. ''We're hoping things will be back to normal by then,'' she said. ''I keep getting calls from people as far away as Italy and Texas asking about the Triple Pier.''</p>
