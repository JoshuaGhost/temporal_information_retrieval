        <p>Foreign bal loonists are canceling reservations to participate in the Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta because of increased charges for air freight. The event, one of New Mexico's most popular tourist attractions, will begin on Oct. 6. In the past, foreign balloonists shipped gondolas, tanks and other equipment into the United States for about $1,200 to $2,000. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, airlines have imposed costly security measures on air cargo, which have tripled the expenses. Officials could not say how many pilots had canceled.</p>
