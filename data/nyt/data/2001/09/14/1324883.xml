        <p>The persistent pall of smoke wafting from the remains of the World Trade Center poses a very small, and steadily diminishing, risk to the public, environmental officials and doctors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>There could be a slight health threat, they said, to city residents with weakened immune systems, heart disease or asthma, and to rescue workers who did not wear protective gear or who smoke. Smoking greatly amplifies the effects of some kinds of pollution, scientists said.</p>
        <p>But over all, the danger was no greater than that on a smoggy day, some officials said.</p>
        <p>Some government scientists, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said they were concerned that city health officials had not done more to encourage those people who were caked in the dust as the disaster unfolded to avoid spreading it around once they were safe at home.</p>
        <p>But tests of air and the dust coating parts of Lower Manhattan appeared to support the official view expressed by city, state and federal health and environmental officials: that health problems from pollution would not be one of the legacies of the attacks. Tests of air samples taken downwind of the smoldering rubble on Tuesday and Wednesday -- mainly in Brooklyn -- disclosed no harmful levels of asbestos, lead or toxic organic compounds, officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Some samples of the dust that cloaked the disaster scene, victims and rescuers on Tuesday showed slightly elevated levels of lead and asbestos, the agency said. But by Wednesday, levels of the substances had dropped below the threshold of any concern, said Bonnie Bellow, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency. Tests on samples taken yesterday would not be completed until today, she said.</p>
        <p>Continued monitoring of fine soot particles and other kinds of air contaminants by state environmental officials also showed ''nothing out of the ordinary,'' a state official said.</p>
        <p>''We're not seeing any violations,'' the official said, ''not seeing anything out of the ordinary, with the exception of small episodic spikes based on wind shifts or activity at ground zero.''</p>
        <p>The best approach for people near the attack site, experts said, would be to limit their exposure to smoke and dust as much as possible, by using filtering masks and washing coated clothing in separate loads from other laundry.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of debris and various kinds of dust,'' Ms. Bellow said. ''The best advice for workers is to wear the proper protection.''</p>
        <p>Federal and city health officials said they had a stockpile of 10,000 paper-filter masks, 5,000 more-sophisticated masks able to filter the tiniest particles, and 2,000 sets of goggles on hand for rescuers to wear.</p>
        <p>At St. Mary's Hospital in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, which treated many victims of the attack who fled across the Brooklyn Bridge, there was no sign of a spike in respiratory illness, said Ernst J. Baptiste, the hospital's executive director.</p>
        <p>The situation was similar at Bellevue Hospital Center, which treated dozens of injuries. Hospital officials said only a small number of people walked in complaining of breathing troubles.</p>
        <p>The first volcano-like clouds of dust and smoke from the fires and building collapses undoubtedly contained potentially harmful particles and gases, which have since dissipated, said Dr. Mark D. Siegel, the director of the medical intensive care unit at Yale-New Haven Hospital.</p>
        <p>The most visible ingredient, though -- the large particles of dust and ash -- was probably the least dangerous, he said.</p>
        <p>The lungs, throat and nasal passages are designed to eject large particles, like the heavy ash that coated Lower Manhattan and fell on many fleeing people, he said. But gases and the finest particles can penetrate deep in the lungs and remain behind even after extensive fits of coughing.</p>
        <p>Generally, the biggest risk posed by those substances would be to people who have a heightened sensitivity to chemicals, Dr. Siegel said. He said that one of the lowest risks would be from inhaling asbestos fibers, if any were released when the towers fell.</p>
        <p>''Even in a worst-case scenario,'' he said, ''most people with asbestos- related lung disease usually had long-term occupational exposure.''</p>
