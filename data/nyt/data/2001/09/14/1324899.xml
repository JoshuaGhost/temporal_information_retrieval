        <p>Within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center, mental health workers at Lenox Hill Hospital had set up a walk-in counseling center. The following day, a handful of people came through, but yesterday that number had quadrupled. Dr. Molly Poag, a psychiatrist and the assistant director for education and training in the hospital's department of psychiatry, said she expected the numbers to increase rapidly with each passing day.</p>
        <p>''We expected a delay in the emotional reactions of people as the tragedy set in,'' said Dr. Poag, who counseled a group of emergency rescue workers on Wednesday who had narrowly escaped death. ''We have seen people who made it out of the building, those who are missing loved ones, and people who were not directly involved but are part of our traumatized community. And there are other people who simply want to know what to say to a friend who is grieving.''</p>

        <p>Within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center, mental health workers at Lenox Hill Hospital had set up a walk-in counseling center. The following day, a handful of people came through, but yesterday that number had quadrupled. Dr. Molly Poag, a psychiatrist and the assistant director for education and training in the hospital's department of psychiatry, said she expected the numbers to increase rapidly with each passing day.</p>
        <p>''We expected a delay in the emotional reactions of people as the tragedy set in,'' said Dr. Poag, who counseled a group of emergency rescue workers on Wednesday who had narrowly escaped death. ''We have seen people who made it out of the building, those who are missing loved ones, and people who were not directly involved but are part of our traumatized community. And there are other people who simply want to know what to say to a friend who is grieving.''</p>
        <p>Lenox Hill is one of many hospitals, clinics and community organizations that have established crisis and grief counseling centers and hot lines in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. Therapists have banded together to offer volunteer counseling services by phone, e-mail or in public places. The New York Psychoanalytic Institute, which set up a crisis and grief center yesterday, is also sending counselors to Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores in Manhattan to offer help.</p>
        <p>''This is a really horrific situation psychologically that has left everyone feeling very vulnerable,'' said Dr. Ruth Karush, a psychiatrist in private practice in Manhattan who worked as a volunteer at the Psychoanalytic Institute's center yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fred Krause, chief psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, said he answered about 10 calls Wednesday night on the hot line set up by the hospital. He said one caller's sense of personal security had been damaged, and another had spent the day looking for two brothers who worked at the World Trade Center. ''At this point,'' he said, ''I don't feel comfortable saying much more than 'I know how anxious you must feel.' Many individuals who are searching for someone who is missing aren't ready to give up hope. My role is to listen and not take their hope away.''</p>
        <p>As eager as many mental health organizations are to be of help, several experts warned that not everyone wanted or needed counseling right after a tragedy.</p>
        <p>''People vary in the way they cope, and one size does not fit all,'' said Dr. Richard McNally, a professor of psychology at Harvard University who studies post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
        <p>In some cases, Dr. McNally said, counseling may even delay recovery, especially when it is conducted in a single session and does not include instruction for coping with stress.</p>
        <p>Dr. McNally said there were conflicting studies of the effectiveness of debriefing -- single sessions soon after an event in which trauma survivors are asked to express their feelings and told what psychological symptoms they might experience. Such sessions should never be forced on anyone, he and other experts said. ''The help should be available but not intrusive,'' he said. If people decide to seek counseling, they should be sure it is provided by someone qualified to treat the problems caused by traumatic stress.</p>
        <p>Studies suggest that programs that teach people coping techniques -- for example, methods of gradually desensitizing themselves to situations or places that evoke bad memories of the trauma -- are preferable to those that simply encourage the venting of emotions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Poag said her role was limited. ''We can only do so much here, but at least we can listen,'' she said. ''We also try our best to make sure everyone is going home to someone -- a friend, family, someone they can talk to. We try to discourage isolation, since social support is one of the most important steps toward healing.''</p>
