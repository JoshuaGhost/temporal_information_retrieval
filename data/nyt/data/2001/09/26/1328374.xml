        <p>The future of Bill Maher's late-night talk show on ABC, ''Politically Incorrect,'' remains in some doubt in the wake of withdrawals from the show by both advertisers and some affliates.</p>
        <p>The withdrawals have come in reaction to comments Mr. Maher made shortly after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. In a discussion of whether the acts by the terrorists could be called cowardly, Mr. Maher said that some previous American military actions like launching missiles from distant locations might be considered cowardly.</p>
        <p>The comment stirred some protest, especially among some talk radio hosts, and that resulted in two of the show's bigger sponsors, FedEx and Sears, leaving. Mr. Maher has apologized for offending any viewers, saying that the times are sensitive and that people should choose their words more carefully.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Maher's regular guests have come to his defense, arguing that his comments were valid and well within the show's charter of  free-wheeling conversation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maher opened his show last Friday night by saying he was grateful to ABC for keeping him on ''without any sponsors.'' Later he amended that by saying ''the network did find some sponsors.'' ABC found only five sponsors, and those included some who are known for buying at bargain rates, including two ''800''-number direct-response ads and one 15-second commercial for condoms.</p>
        <p>ABC executives said yesterday that the two big sponsors have not returned and that the show will continue with commercials from other sponsors. But one executive said, ''It's obviously a big thing.''</p>
        <p>In addition, a group of three Midwest stations owned by Citadel Communications -- in Des Moines and Sioux City, Iowa, and in Lincoln, Neb. -- told ABC last week they would stop carrying the program. That brought the number of ABC station that dropped the show to a total of 12. An ABC executive said that the network was talking the issue over with the stations and hoped to have some resume ''Politically Incorrect'' soon.</p>
