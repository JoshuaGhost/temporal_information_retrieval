        <p>Some 80 Palestinians were wounded today, most of them by bullets, as Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians demonstrating, throwing stones and, at times, shooting on the first anniversary of their renewed intifada, or uprising.</p>
        <p>In the surge of violence today, three Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers and another blew himself up, apparently while making a bomb in the flash-point town of Hebron in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Late tonight, there were reports that soldiers killed three more Palestinians after they were caught planting a mine in Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza Strip where five other Palestinians have been killed in clashes in the last two days.</p>
        <p>About six Israelis were also wounded, at least one a civilian shot near Hebron. The Israeli military reported many incidents of shooting, as well as attacks with grenades and firebombs.</p>
        <p>The fighting came despite a 10-day-old truce between Palestinians and Israeli forces, and tonight the truce remained officially in effect.</p>
        <p>For the first time in months, Palestinian and Israeli security officials met today in Tel Aviv to work out details for ending the last year of fighting after a meeting earlier this week between the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>Today security officials from the two sides worked out the next steps in the truce. The Israelis reportedly said they would ease the tight restrictions on Palestinians' movements, including relaxing a checkpoint at a refugee camp near Ramallah. They also said they would open the southern border crossing near Gaza, though that seemed to be in doubt after the fighting today.</p>
        <p>The truce was imposed largely under pressure from the United States, particularly in repeated phone calls from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, as it seeks to recruit Arab nations for its campaign against terrorism.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials, though, have criticized Mr. Arafat for not taking strong enough steps to rein in Palestinians. Mr. Arafat contends he is doing all he can.</p>
        <p>There were reports tonight of clashes between angry Palestinians in Rafah and Mr. Arafat's security forces, who reportedly were trying to stop youths from throwing stones at the Israeli authorities.</p>
        <p>''Some people are not accepting it,'' a pharmacist, Muhammad Titi, 47, said, referring to Mr. Arafat's orders not to fight Israelis in Rafah. ''All these lives lost cannot go into the drain. Some people have a cause.''</p>
        <p>Violence had slacked off in the last week, though not completely, and Israeli officials had expected a flare-up on the intifada's anniversary.</p>
        <p>Around Palestinian areas in the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians marked the day with three minutes of silence, followed by marches, demonstrations and, in some cases, attacks on Israeli military posts.</p>
        <p>In Hebron, the Israeli military said Palestinians had opened fire on soldiers, and a 25-year-old Palestinian was killed and 12 others wounded when soldiers returned fire. Two more Palestinians, whose ages were uncertain, were killed nearby when Israeli troops shot at youths throwing stones.</p>
        <p>In Ramallah, in the West Bank, 24 stone-throwing Palestinians were reported wounded by gunshots. Outside Gaza City, hospital officials said 41 Palestinians had been shot, all with live rounds, except for two with rubber bullets.</p>
        <p>''I was throwing a stone,'' Musa al-Madana, 20, said in a Gaza City hospital ward packed with other bandaged young men, ''then I could feel a bullet on my hand, then on my leg.''</p>
        <p>He said that despite the truce, he believed that fighting should go on. ''We are fighting for Jerusalem, for our lives, for our land,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Rafah, anger seethed today over the five dead and the eight houses demolished in the last two days, following Israeli reprisals for a bomb attack on Wednesday, just before Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat met, that wounded three soldiers. Israelis and Palestinians traded fire there throughout today.</p>
        <p>But war and the need to live a normal life still mixed. Even amid gunfire, Emmad Najar, 28, went shopping this morning with his three young sons in Rafah. The boys were talking about lunch, then a bullet struck their father in the forehead, several hundred yards from the fighting.</p>
        <p>Instead of crashing into his skull, the bullet burrowed its way around Mr. Najar's head under his scalp and ended its path, but not his life, in the fatty skin at the nape of his neck.</p>
        <p>''It was meant to kill someone, such a shot,'' he said from a hospital bed here today. ''I am so lucky.''</p>
