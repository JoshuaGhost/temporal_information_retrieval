        <p>THEY say nobody cares about Barry Bonds.</p>
        <p>I care.</p>
        <p>Bonds is bearing down on one of baseball's most hallowed marks -- Mark McGwire's single-season home run record of 70. Yet the record and Bonds's pursuit have been intertwined with personality and quirks, which, some say, have dulled the nation's passion for the chase. Bonds has been criticized for being aloof and arrogant and, on top of all that, the nation is in mourning. Bonds is mourning, too. Bonds stunned reporters last night when he revealed that one of his best friends had died on Thursday. ''Every time I have had the opportunity to exhale or breathe, something has come up that has been difficult for me,'' he said last night.</p>
        <p>Bonds's pursuit is a small part of a massive first-aid kit for our national trauma. He is also a line of demarcation: life before Sept. 11,  life after Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>Before Sept. 11, Bonds was, like the rest of us, involved in a job, a career, working toward dreams and exorcising demons. His two- pronged pursuit was carrying the Giants to the World Series and him toward McGwire's record. After Sept. 11 Bonds, like the rest of us, had to reconfigure his world, fit vanities and pursuits into a world suddenly more circumspect, more fragile.</p>
        <p>We have been encouraged by everyone from the president to the mayor of New York City to fly and walk about without fear. While that's easy to say when you fly on Air Force One and travel with bodyguards, the point is well taken: we must move on. Bonds, in a public way, is the epitome of forward movement.</p>
        <p>We have pushed forward, tried the best we can to hit home runs in our respective fields. Bonds has continued to hit home runs in his.</p>
        <p>''I'm just playing a game,'' Bonds said earlier this week, responding to a familiar line of questioning about how the pennant race fits into life. ''I'm doing my job.''</p>
        <p>Bonds's remarks reminded me of the national celebration surrounding Cal Ripken breaking Lou Gehrig's consecutive games record of 2,130. The essence of the celebration was that Ripken did not get the most hits or smash the most home runs. He was the quintessential average Joe, who showed up for work every day.</p>
        <p>There was an ecstatic celebration over McGwire's chase of Roger Maris's record of 61. The fervor hardly subsided after McGwire admitted using androstenedione. Sammy Sosa, who was in the chase with McGwire, played the appropriate second fiddle and was applauded by the news media for being so accessible and for not complaining about obviously favoring McGwire.</p>
        <p>Bonds does not make our jobs easy -- he will not get the good guy award. Bonds does not grovel, does not court or curtsy. Some reporters feel he is aloof at best, a jerk at worst; they write it, the public believes it, but who really knows?</p>
        <p>He is a second-generation superstar who is climbing an eternal mountain.</p>
        <p>His father, Bobby Bonds, was an outstanding player. His godfather, Willie Mays, is one of the greatest of all time, a national icon. Bonds could hit a million home runs and still never measure up. There has to be something demoralizing about that.</p>
        <p>The most important thing to remember is that Bonds, unlike McGwire, is not a one-dimensional carnival act. He has broken McGwire's 1998 National League record of 162 walks and could break Babe Ruth's major league mark of 170, set in 1923. Bonds has an astounding on-base percentage -- .502, and has a chance to break Babe Ruth's .847 slugging average, a mark Ruth established in 1920.</p>
        <p>That Bonds is challenging a record within the context of a searing pennant race makes his feat more extraordinary. They say nobody cares.</p>
        <p>I care.</p>
        <p>Caring has become a civic duty these dark days. This is not about baseball. This is about the triumph of the human spirit. This is why I pull for Michael Jordan to soar to new heights; pull for the Mets to complete a scintillating return from hopelessness and reach the playoffs. The act of triumph extends to parents, sons and daughters who suffered the loss of friends and family on Sept. 11. To everyone who lives in Washington and New York who lost a still indefinable piece of themselves. We look for that triumph of spirit wherever we can find it.</p>
        <p>Barry Bonds returns to work: knocking baseballs out of ballparks. He has eight games to break McGwire's record.</p>
        <p>Don't say that no one cares.</p>
        <p>I care.</p>
