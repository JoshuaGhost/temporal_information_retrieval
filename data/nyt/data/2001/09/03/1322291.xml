        <p>Congress and President Bush return from vacations this week to face a vanishing budget surplus, a limping economy and a long list of competing spending priorities -- in other words, a recipe for a bruising political collision over spending and taxes.</p>
        <p>With the Senate in Democratic hands by one vote and the House narrowly controlled by Republicans, the political stakes are enormous, especially if a result of the debate is a budget that continues to spend Social Security taxes instead of using them to pay off the federal debt.</p>
        <p>''No one expected the surplus problem and the Social Security problem to appear this quickly,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. ''Two or three months from the tax cut and here we are already.''</p>
        <p>''The way this is resolved will have a lot to do with the next election,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''People's perceptions could well be formed in this period, with regard to next fall.''</p>
        <p>As talks between Congressional leaders and Mr. Bush get under way this week, Mr. Gephardt and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate majority leader, want the president to revise his budget request to take into account new projections of a much smaller surplus.</p>
        <p>But Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has other ideas: making the new 10-year tax cut permanent, pushing for a cut in the capital gains tax and extending the existing tax credit for industrial research and development. A senior Republican aide said that when Mr. Hastert meets with Mr. Bush this week, he would raise these possibilities as ways of countering any further economic weakness.</p>
        <p>Complicating the outlook in Congress, which is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday, are sharp differences between the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate over education, trade and energy, which are at the top of the White House's domestic agenda. Disputes also linger between the House and the Senate over campaign finance and health care.</p>
        <p>But the immediate quandary is how to pass all 13 bills to finance next year's government programs. That task, which is supposed to be completed this month, has been immeasurably complicated by new estimates showing that Congress has available billions of dollars less than it once expected, unless it dips into the Social Security surplus. That is something both parties had promised not to do.</p>
        <p>President Bush said last week that he wanted Congress to direct its immediate attention and the dwindling money first to his two priorities: education and a $18.4 billion increase for the military. But Republicans and Democrats said that it would be impractical, indeed nearly impossible, to take up those two issues first at the exclusion of the rest.</p>
        <p>The military spending target looks particularly vulnerable, especially because Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has not completed his sweeping review of Pentagon policies and programs. ''We are looking at a funding request to fund a defense of the past and not one of the future,'' said Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who leads the House Budget Committee. ''That is not what was suggested or promised. It has a much higher hurdle to cross.''</p>
        <p>Lawmakers are also debating whether they can afford other proposals, including an energy plan proposed by Mr. Bush and approved by the House that contains $33 billion in costly tax credits, a proposed farm bill that continues crop subsidies that were to be phased out, some kind of prescription drug benefit for the elderly and assorted other tax breaks that will expire if not extended.</p>
        <p>''There isn't anything left over,'' said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. ''The combination of an economic slowdown and the tax cut has scooped off the table everything we needed to deal with our long-term problems. It is a huge dereliction of duty.''</p>
        <p>The Bush camp has continued to say that budget targets can be met and that the picture is far from dire.</p>
        <p>''We're dealing with historic, gigantic surpluses under any of these numbers,'' Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said today on the NBC news program ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>''We're not talking about cutting spending for next year,'' Mr. Daniels  said. ''Spending in the president's budget would go up over $100 billion to strengthen the economy, education and security, and we can do that, consistent with growing -- not shrinking -- surpluses, and it would be misleading to suggest otherwise.''</p>
        <p>But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, called that view ''divorced from reality, and it is so wrong on the fundamental facts that he put forward that it really underscores the nature of the confrontation that's about to take place.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Kerry said it would be unwise to raise taxes or cut spending during an economic downturn, he added, ''You have to put everything on the table, and the first step is for the president to be prepared to say, 'We may have misjudged how much money we have available.' ''</p>
        <p>Republicans, while acknowledging that the surplus shrank unexpectedly fast, said the tax cut was doing precisely what it was intended to do. ''Republicans are achieving the goal of leaving Democrats with less money to spend hand-over-fist with before Congress adjourns this year,'' said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.</p>
        <p>But it also made it harder to balance the budget over the coming years without using some money from Social Security taxes, which by  agreement have been earmarked recently for reducing the national debt.</p>
        <p>Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the government would have to spend $9 billion of the Social Security surplus this year because general tax revenues fell short as the economy softened and taxpayers received a rebate from the new tax bill.</p>
        <p>Next year, the projections are only a bit better. Congress is already on a course to spend $661 billion in the 13 spending bills for the 2002 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Aside from Social Security surpluses, there would only be $9 billion more for anything Congress wants to do next year that is not included in current plans, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans in the House say they must keep their promise not to use the Social Security surplus for everyday government spending, even though analysts agree that it has little practical effect. ''My personal view is that any amount of new spending, even defense spending, is not doable in the House if it threatens the Social Security trust fund,'' said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri who is the chief deputy whip. ''We don't have to grow the government at twice the rate of inflation.''</p>
        <p>Splitting the difference between military and education spending  may be a way to satisfy both sides.</p>
        <p>On education, the House and Senate are still at odds over when to take action on failing schools and how to best track improvements in students' academic performance. But the biggest battle is expected to be over money. Mr. Bush requested an increase of $669 million for education in his budget. But the House wants to increase the $18 billion education budget by $5 billion, and the Senate wants to increase it by $16 billion.</p>
        <p>Similarly, just before the recess, the House passed a bipartisan bill to overhaul the managed care system. While the bill resembles the Senate version, considerable differences remain over the scope of lawsuits. ''It has not been worked out,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who leads the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Hastert expects to move quickly on a bill that would give Mr. Bush more flexibility in negotiating trade agreements, something the president considers a priority. The Senate, however, is not enthusiastic. ''When are we going to do that?'' asked Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the second-ranking Democrat. ''Is it more important than a patients' bill of rights or education? Forget about it. Do it next year.''</p>
        <p>The Senate will hold hearings on its energy plan, but the outcome, if there is one this year, is not expected to reflect the House version, which includes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and dozens of expensive tax breaks for the oil, coal and gas industries.</p>
        <p>The Senate also has little interest in moving on a bill that would increase federal financing for charities run by religious groups. The House has already passed a bill for Mr. Bush's religion-based initiative.</p>
        <p>The farm bill may be another casualty of the budget wars, with even the White House saying money must be found before the bill can be pushed through.</p>
        <p>A prescription drug benefit for older people also appears imperiled this year, although Democrats and Republicans say $300 billion has been set aside for the next 10 years for that program and other changes in Medicare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy said Senate Democrats would push hard for a $1.50-an-hour increase in the minimum wage, but Republicans want the wage increase to go hand-in-hand with tax credits for businesses.</p>
        <p>And in the House, supporters of a bill to overhaul the campaign finance system still hope to force the legislation onto the floor by collecting 218 signatures from members, a fight Republicans would like to avoid. The Democrats have said they are only a dozen or so votes short.</p>
        <p>To avoid that kind of power play on the budget, Democrats say Mr. Bush should make the first move and get the negotiations started with some concrete proposals. ''The president has got to get engaged,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. ''If he does, it doesn't have to be unpleasant.''</p>
