        <p>Calling Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority "a kingdom of terror," the prime minister of Israel said he didn't believe talks with Mr. Arafat will amount to anything.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel said today that even though he had authorized high-level talks with Yasir Arafat to try bringing about a cease-fire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he doubted they would amount to anything.</p>
        <p>The problem, Mr. Sharon said in an interview, lay with Mr. Arafat, whose Palestinian Authority, he said, is ''a kingdom of terror.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon also endorsed the creation of a military buffer zone along the unmarked boundary separating Israel and the West Bank. That idea has emerged in recent days, and it seems destined to cause an uproar among Palestinians because it would mean new restrictions on their movement.</p>
        <p>Most of them would be prohibited from entering strips of the West Bank that run along its ''seam'' with Israel -- closed areas that security officials say could be a mile or two wide in places.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he and Mr. Arafat would meet next week in the first of several sessions to seek a halt to the fighting that has thrown both sides, and much of the Middle East, into deepening crisis for nearly a year.</p>
        <p>No date or place has been set, and Palestinian officials were guarded about the prospects for bringing about a more meaningful truce than several that have been declared over the last 11 months, never to materialize. Both sides were also well aware that Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres had met twice on the same issue recently, in late June and mid-July, with no tangible results.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon added his own skepticism today in a telephone conversation from his farm in the Negev, Israel's southern desert. Although he and Mr. Peres go back many decades together and are in the same coalition government, they belong to rival parties and do not agree on the value of talking to Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''Peres believes that he can influence Arafat to stop firing,'' he said, speaking in English. ''I have doubts about that. But I told him, 'If you can do that, of course it's a good thing to meet.' ''</p>
        <p>Blueprints for a new buffer zone were announced by the army on Thursday, while Mr. Sharon was on a visit to Russia. Angry, he suspended the plans, but that, he said, was because he thought the generals had overstepped their bounds on a decision that should be left to political leaders.</p>
        <p>''Look, we must have a buffer zone,'' the prime minister said. Israel, he said, is a ''tiny, tiny, small country,'' vulnerable to suicide bombers and other attackers who, despite existing roadblocks, manage to slip across porous borders from the West Bank. The issue, he suggested, was not whether closed military areas would be created, but rather what would be the legal foundation and the status of Palestinians living there.</p>
        <p>''We have the right, I would say, to defend ourselves,'' he said. ''That's our birthright, to defend ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Apparently referring to Israeli policies that have produced international criticism -- like the killing of Palestinian figures accused of sponsoring terrorism and army moves into Palestinian-ruled areas after an Israeli neighborhood on Jerusalem's edge came under fire -- he said, ''The United States would have done the same thing if that would have been happening there.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think the United States would have allowed that Washington would be under fire,'' Mr. Sharon said.</p>
        <p>The 73-year-old prime minister has given almost no interviews since forming his center-right coalition government seven months ago. After several requests to meet him were made through his aides, he unexpectedly called from his farm this afternoon, for a conversation that lasted about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>He seemed in high spirits, this general turned politician, buoyed perhaps by a poll in the newspaper Maariv today showing that his approval ratings had risen. Before the paroxysms of violence that began shaking the region last September, and given the many controversies that have swirled around him for decades, most Israelis would have put his chances of ever becoming prime minister somewhere between meager and nonexistent. Not only was he elected, but thus far a majority of Israelis also like his tough stand against the Palestinians. In the Maariv poll, 59 percent said they were satisfied with his overall performance, compared with 49 percent a few weeks ago. A somewhat smaller number, 53 percent, said they were pleased with his security policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon said he had agreed to let Mr. Peres talk only about a possible cease-fire with Mr. Arafat. His goal, he said, was a multistep move toward calm, in line with recommendations made in April by an international commission led by a former United States senator, George J. Mitchell.</p>
        <p>As interpreted by Mr. Sharon, that would require a total absence of violence for seven days, followed by a ''cooling-off period'' of six weeks, and then by a period of ''confidence-building measures.'' For the Palestinians, he said, that would mean collecting tens of thousands of weapons stockpiled in the West Bank and Gaza in violation of past agreements. For Israel, he said, it would mean agreeing during that phase to freeze new settlements in the territories.</p>
        <p>But he is not prepared to stop existing settlements from expanding, he said. ''There are young soldiers coming back from the army,'' he said. ''They want to get married. What are they going to do? They have to get a formal agreement for marriage from Arafat?''</p>
        <p>And even all that lies well in the future, he added. To him, the only issue now is a cease-fire, not negotiating political and territorial arrangements with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''First of all, there should be full cessation of terror, hostilities and incitement,'' he said, adding that Israeli Arabs have become involved in acts of anti-Jewish terrorism as a result of ''Palestinian official incitement in the official media.''</p>
        <p>''There should be full cessation, not reduction and not efforts,'' he said. ''One cannot measure efforts. I speak about results: peace.''</p>
        <p>''It's a different government,'' he said. ''This government will not negotiate under terror and fire -- will not.''</p>
        <p>But he strongly suggested that he did not believe that Mr. Arafat was prepared to meet his demands.</p>
        <p>While avoiding the kinds of attacks on Mr. Arafat's character that he has made in the past, Mr. Sharon said at different points in the conversation that the Palestinian Authority was  ''a kingdom of terror'' and that the Palestinian leader had ''formed a coalition of terror'' against Israel. Mr. Arafat has shown that he can stop anti-Israel violence when he wants, but chooses not to, he said.</p>
        <p>''About half the casualties we had were caused by Arafat's presidential guard, where people are chosen one by one,'' he said. ''Can you imagine that an American presidential guard will be involved in terror?''</p>
        <p>One thing that he hoped would emerge from an Arafat-Peres meeting, Mr. Sharon said, was an easing of conditions for ordinary Palestinians. He acknowledged that they were living now under what he called a siege.</p>
        <p>For many months, their lives have been severely disrupted by army blockades and other Israeli restrictions that make it difficult for most people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to get to work or even to do basic things like visit relatives or go to a doctor.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy to the Middle East, said that Israel's tight controls were having a ''devastating'' effect on the Palestinian economy and that unless they were eased, half the Palestinian population would be living in poverty by year's end. Mr. Roed-Larsen also said it was crucial to the Palestinian Authority's survival that the Israelis hand over tens of millions of dollars in tax revenues that they have collected on the authority's behalf and refused to transfer.</p>
        <p>The difficulty in improving conditions for Palestinians, Mr. Sharon said today, is that ''once we open the siege and things like that, we immediately have casualties.'' Mr. Arafat was to blame, he said, for both the roadblocks and Israel's refusal to turn over tax revenue. That money, he said, finances attacks on Israel by Mr. Arafat's security forces.</p>
        <p>''We didn't feel from a moral point of view that we have to pay the wages of those that murder us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon saw no quick end to the fighting. ''I tell you we are in this conflict now over 120 years; it didn't start today,'' he said. But he added: ''I don't worry about that. I believe that Israel is much stronger than many of its leaders.''</p>
        <p>Even if a genuine truce is reached, the prime minister said, the two sides will have to work out a completely new set of political guidelines.</p>
        <p>''Oslo failed,'' he said, referring to the benchmark agreements reached in the Norwegian capital in 1993. ''What was left was Arafat's Nobel Prize.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Arafat was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Mr. Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated a year later. Some Jews in the United States and elsewhere have begun a campaign to demand that the Palestinian's prize be taken from him.</p>
        <p>Asked if he agreed, Mr. Sharon laughed. ''How can one take it?'' he said. ''I believe he has to volunteer to give it back.''</p>
