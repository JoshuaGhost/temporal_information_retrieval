        <p>Betty Buckley reached out on Wednesday evening from the stage of Alice Tully Hall to a city raw with hurt after last week's terrorist attacks and conjured a mood of empathetic fortitude in a hushed audience that was still reeling with sorrow and fear. The fragile spell she wove in her mostly somber concert was the kind of feeling a great dramatic singer can evoke when emotionally in tune with an audience. And she did it without resorting to maudlin speeches or tear-jerking vocal histrionics.</p>
        <p>The qualities inherent in Ms. Buckley's voice made her singularly well equipped for the job. The singer grew up in Fort Worth, and her astringent, cutting instrument, with its embedded thorns and crags, conveys a potent mixture of true grit and vulnerability. If the outside of Ms. Buckley's voice seems almost crusty, that surface is easily punctured. What lies beneath is a quivering, mercurical responsiveness to song lyrics and musical subtleties. When Ms. Buckley sings at full volume, those contradictory elements merge. Her voice expands and fills out, and she projects the sort of embattled resilience that was Édith Piaf's emotional calling card.</p>

        <p>Betty Buckley reached out on Wednesday evening from the stage of Alice Tully Hall to a city raw with hurt after last week's terrorist attacks and conjured a mood of empathetic fortitude in a hushed audience that was still reeling with sorrow and fear. The fragile spell she wove in her mostly somber concert was the kind of feeling a great dramatic singer can evoke when emotionally in tune with an audience. And she did it without resorting to maudlin speeches or tear-jerking vocal histrionics.</p>
        <p>The qualities inherent in Ms. Buckley's voice made her singularly well equipped for the job. The singer grew up in Fort Worth, and her astringent, cutting instrument, with its embedded thorns and crags, conveys a potent mixture of true grit and vulnerability. If the outside of Ms. Buckley's voice seems almost crusty, that surface is easily punctured. What lies beneath is a quivering, mercurical responsiveness to song lyrics and musical subtleties. When Ms. Buckley sings at full volume, those contradictory elements merge. Her voice expands and fills out, and she projects the sort of embattled resilience that was Édith Piaf's emotional calling card.</p>
        <p>At Wednesday's concert, which opened the fall season of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series (the show was repeated last night), Ms. Buckley put these contradictions to powerful dramatic use in a program that mixed traditional popular standards with ballads by two generations of soft-rock singer-songwriters from Joni Mitchell to Lisa Loeb, and songs by contemporary theater composers like Jason Robert Brown and Ricky Ian Gordon.</p>
        <p>Accompanying Ms. Buckley was a seven-member ensemble led by her longtime musical director and arranger, Kenny Werner. The inclusion of a Brazilian percussionist (Duduka Da Fonseca) enhanced the international flavor of Mr. Werner's elaborate (and sometimes overly fussy) arrangements. With their rapidly shifting harmonies and diffuse, impressionistic textures, his loose-jointed jazz-tinged settings allowed Ms. Buckley more than enough rhythmic latitude to turn many of the numbers into fluid dramatic monologues.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with a striking original song, ''The Doorway,'' written by Ms. Buckley with Allen Farnham, which set the meditative, ultimately consoling mood for the evening. Ms. Buckley's lyric speaks about moving through time and through pain with music and a singer who leads the way. A majority of the songs in the show took a long view of life and love, and several evoked the sense of leafing through albums of treasured snapshots. Among the most memorable were Mary Chapin Carpenter's ''Come On Come On,'' Mr. Brown's ''Stars and the Moon,'' Ms. Loeb's ''Falling in Love,'' Ms. Mitchell's ''I Had a King,'' and Nancy Ford and Gretchen Cryer's ''Old Friend.''</p>
        <p>Except toward the end of the show, Ms. Buckley's narrative point of view was that of a spontaneous storyteller. There were sudden flashes of humor (her version of Rufus Wainwright's self-mocking ''Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk'' was a witty revelation), and occasionally her singing subsided into colloquial speech song. This approach lent even ballads as familiar as ''Fire and Rain'' and ''A Case of You'' a stream-of-consciousness immediacy that made you see them in a new way.</p>
        <p>Ms. Buckley held back until the end, when she capped the program with a majestic, full-force rendition of ''America the Beautiful'' segued into ''Bridge Over Troubled Water.'' Instead of aiming for the sentimental jugular, she imbued both anthems with an unornamented clarity and a feeling of warm, steadfast resolve that were appropriate to the moment and gratefully welcomed.</p>
