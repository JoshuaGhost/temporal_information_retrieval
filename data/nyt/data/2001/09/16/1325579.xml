        <p>For many mental health professionals the disaster was a summons. Therapists of all varieties and degrees of expertise set up impromptu grief counseling centers, offered their wisdom on television and radio and sped to the site of the devastation to provide crisis support for rescue and emergency workers.</p>
        <p>But in an open letter to their colleagues distributed this weekend, a group of psychologists questioned whether the ministrations of a therapist are what all people want or need now, at a time when stress, fear, anger, uncertainty and grief are entirely normal, and when the full impact of what has happened has not yet sunk in. And they cautioned that thrusting help on people instead of letting them seek it themselves might in some case do more harm than good.</p>

        <p>For many mental health professionals the disaster was a summons. Therapists of all varieties and degrees of expertise set up impromptu grief counseling centers, offered their wisdom on television and radio and sped to the site of the devastation to provide crisis support for rescue and emergency workers.</p>
        <p>But in an open letter to their colleagues distributed this weekend, a group of psychologists questioned whether the ministrations of a therapist are what all people want or need now, at a time when stress, fear, anger, uncertainty and grief are entirely normal, and when the full impact of what has happened has not yet sunk in. And they cautioned that thrusting help on people instead of letting them seek it themselves might in some case do more harm than good.</p>
        <p>''As psychologists, our instinct is to help, and indeed there is much we can do,'' said the letter, signed by 19 psychologists, some of whom study the psychological effects of traumatic events and others of whom have themselves been involved in crisis work. ''But in times like this it is imperative that we refrain from the urge to intervene in ways that -- however well intentioned -- have the potential to make matters worse.''</p>
        <p>The psychologists include several prominent experts on the psychological effect of trauma. They cited several studies that had found that certain crisis intervention techniques might be ineffective or might even slow recovery. In particular, they said, are one-time ''debriefing'' sessions immediately after a trauma that tell people what symptoms they might develop and encourage them to vent their emotions but offer no specific coping strategies.</p>
        <p>They said therapists could be most helpful by empathizing with the suffering of victims and their families, by offering ''appropriate psychological services'' to people who in a few weeks are still having problems and by ''supporting the community structures that people naturally call upon in times of grief and suffering.''</p>
        <p>The letter writers emphasized that they did not want to discourage therapists from making help available or people from seeking help if they felt they could not cope on their own. But Dr. Gerald Rosen, a clinical psychologist in private practice in Seattle and one of the letter's authors, said, ''The public should be very concerned about medicalizing what are human reactions to things.''</p>
        <p>The symptoms that some experts are publicly calling post-traumatic stress disorder -- like startle reactions, intrusive images like the tower collapsing, fear of tall buildings, sleeping problems, irritability and intense sadness -- are in fact normal responses to extreme fear and stress that will fade with time, for most people. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, a serious, abnormal reaction to trauma, is made only when symptoms have lasted for at least a month.</p>
        <p>The letter was posted on several Internet bulletin boards for mental health experts and sent to the Monitor on Psychology, the magazine of the American Psychological Association. The signers included Dr. Edna Foa of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert on post-traumatic stress disorders, and Dr. Richard McNally of Harvard, another expert on the effects of trauma.</p>
        <p>But the psychologists' statements drew immediate criticism from other specialists in crisis intervention, who said the letter could discourage rescue workers and other people from accepting vital services that might help protect them from more serious psychological trouble later.</p>
        <p>''To hear these criticisms when people are in the midst of the operation is just ludicrous,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Mitchell, the president of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides crisis intervention, training and support for emergency services, corporations and law enforcement internationally.</p>
        <p>A former firefighter and paramedic, Dr. Mitchell agreed that some therapists who go to disaster scenes are badly trained and inappropriately intrusive. He also concurred with many signers of the letter that the majority of people exposed to traumatic circumstances recover and that no one should be forced to talk about feelings, especially immediately after a disaster.</p>
        <p>But he said the letter writers misrepresented the nature of organized programs offering mental health crisis services to trauma victims. And he noted that other studies demonstrated the protective benefits of such early intervention. ''Early intervention is an extremely important part of the process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard M. Gist, a signer of the letter who is an assistant to the director of the Fire Department in Kansas City, Mo., said he became concerned about debriefing techniques after using them in 1981, when an explosion in Kansas City killed six firefighters.</p>
        <p>''The impact of the first attempt at intervention was clearly not successful in addressing or relieving symptoms,'' Dr. Gist said. When the same methods were used with rescue workers after a plane crash killed 112 people in Sioux City, Iowa, he added, the workers complained that the help had been both ineffective and intrusive.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grist also said 11 studies of debriefing techniques, analyzed in a report this year in The Cochrane Library, a publication devoted to evidence-based medicine, found that some types of debriefing techniques were either ineffective in preventing the more serious symptoms or actually appeared to increase the risk. The studies focused on single-session treatment that involved some form of emotional venting by encouraging the recollection of the event.</p>
        <p>It is not clear why such techniques might make things worse, Dr. Gist and other psychologists said, but it may be that asking people to be aware of symptoms and having them recall their experiences ''opens up the wound,'' without providing people with specific techniques -- like desensitization or cognitive therapy -- for coping with the stress.</p>
        <p>''If we tell people there is a severe danger that they will fall from a precipice, we should not be surprised that some of those people end up on the rocks,'' Dr. Gist said.</p>
        <p>Epidemiological studies have found that in the majority of people, even those exposed to even the most severe traumas, acute symptoms of stress subside within three months. About 25 percent go on to develop stress disorders.</p>
        <p>Traumatic experiences can also stir up memories of stressful events, aggravated symptoms of acute stress, but these also usually diminish over time.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mitchell, however, said the studies considered by the review's authors were not representative of the way his foundation, or any other reputable group, went about providing mental health help to people under extreme stress.</p>
        <p>Rescue and emergency workers are not pushed to talk or to vent feelings while they are still in the middle of the crisis, as they are now.</p>
        <p>''Rescue personnel right now are in operations mode,'' Dr. Mitchell said. ''They must suppress their emotions in order to do the job. They're seeing if they can recover any other lives from this building.''</p>
