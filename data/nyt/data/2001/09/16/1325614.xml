        <p>MOST of Harrison's restaurants seem to be clustered on the blocks around its train station. But along Halstead Avenue to the south, almost out of town, Halstead Avenue Bistro joins the venerable Gus's and creates a fresh dining outpost very much worth knowing about.</p>
        <p>Having gentrified a longstanding neighborhood Italian restaurant, this newcomer offers creative, carefully prepared dishes in the currently popular fusion style.</p>
        <p>Diners thinking they've seen and tasted it all before have a surprise in store. There was hardly a cliché to be found among the items on the thoughtfully designed menu. Most dishes were complex, balanced beautifully and, considering the flavor impact they delivered, unaffected.</p>
        <p>Dinner began with a lagniappe: perhaps a half dollar round of toast with a lick of eggplant or paté, a piece of sushi roll or a luscious chopped tomato salad.</p>
        <p>If Manhattan clam chowder is offered, skip it and move on to other starters. Some of the clams were rubbery and the chowder was overwhelmed with smoky flavor. But nothing was amiss with a soft tortilla filled with succulent pieces of duck and meltingly delicious caramelized onion and aromatic vegetables, a bit of cashew butter adding to the richness -- on the off chance that some diners would find the flavor of the dish wanting.</p>
        <p>Those julienne vegetables also added subtle nuances to glossy, translucent ravioli, their filling a wonder of chopped shrimp and fennel. The tender pillows had been tossed in butter sauce heightened by a dash of Sambuca, which added extra punch to the fennel. Cut into six rounds, a roll of vegetable sushi was served with frizzled onions. Be sure to dip the pieces into the dots of wasabi and truffle oil that circle the plate.</p>
        <p>An impressive assemblage featured seared sea scallops on a polenta cake studded with onion and kernels of fresh corn. A mixture of balsamico and honey added sweet-tart notes.</p>
        <p>Part of the success of dishes here is that herbs and a variety of skillfully and lovingly prepared vegetables add plenty of flavor.</p>
        <p>Sea scallops also won high marks as an entree, and there was no redundancy in the two concepts. The entree brought the scallops sautéed with jumbo shrimp atop a mound of lovely mashed butternut squash with fresh peas, string beans, slices of shiitake and zucchini. Crisps of pancetta were tossed about as well, although this element could have been omitted without any damage to the dish.</p>
        <p>Pressed with black and white sesame seeds, a pretty presentation of  salmon came with great potatoes, green from having been mashed with sweet basil. This fish was better than one evening's special tuna, a dish sabotaged by incendiary wasabi mashed potatoes.</p>
        <p>Cauliflower and truffle mashed potatoes almost stole the show from an enormous, lean double pork chop, with its sweetness cut by tasty braised cabbage. And there was no need to mask this restaurant's calf's liver. Instead of classic onions and bacon, the notably fresh and silken meat came treated to porcini mushrooms and risotto.</p>
        <p>Desserts were dandy; someone knows how to bake. Don't miss apple and cranberry tart, the pastry base supple and buttery. Lemon mousse napoleon alternated wafers of delicate pastry with dollops of lemon mousse. Ricotta cheesecake of medium density came sweetened with raisins and pine nuts, and bananas Foster, pretty good but the least of these, was capped with puff pastry and chocolate ice cream.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $31 without drinks, tax and tip.</p>
        <p>Halstead Avenue Bistro  123 Halstead Avenue, Harrison.  (914) 777-1181.</p>
        <p>VERY GOOD</p>
