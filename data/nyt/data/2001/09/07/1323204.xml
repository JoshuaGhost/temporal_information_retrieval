      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In a case that prompted a major change in parole for felons, a civil lawsuit by a murder victim's family has ended in failure. In 1997, Nicholas Eugene Pryor, a parolee, stabbed and strangled Jenna Grieshaber, a murder that led to passage of Jenna's Law, eliminating parole for violent felons. Yesterday, the Court of Appeals refused to hear an appeal of the Grieshaber family's suit, which had been dismissed. The family sued the Albany police, who waited more than 40 minutes to enter Ms. Grieshaber's apartment because of a barking dog and then did not immediately move a bed crushing her neck, though signs were later found that she might still have been alive. The city argued that she would have died, regardless of police actions.</p>
