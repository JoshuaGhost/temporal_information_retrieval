        <p>In a series of meticulous experiments, researchers at the University of Wisconsin have pinpointed genetic changes that converted a chicken influenza virus into a deadly menace to humans.</p>
        <p>The chicken virus was found in Hong Kong in 1997. Though bird flu viruses usually do not infect humans, this one did, killing 6 of 18 people who contracted it, an extraordinarily high death rate for an infectious disease.</p>
        <p>To stop the virus, the government of Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of all chickens. But the virus has returned there this year -- not once but, after a lesser slaughter, a second time.</p>
        <p>Experts caution that the new work on the 1997 virus, being published  today in the journal Science, is only a first step, not a definitive answer to what turns a flu virus lethal. But, they say, it may lead to information allowing scientists to predict which emerging flu strains are especially dangerous.</p>
        <p>''If we want to understand the genetic basis'' for dangerous flu strains, ''this is the way we should be going,'' Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology said of the researchers' approach.</p>
        <p>Dr. Linda Lambert, the influenza program officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, ''What is really surprising and kind of made people sit up straight is that what allows the virus to go from nonlethal to lethal may be only a few genes.''</p>
        <p>The message, said Dr. John Oxford, a flu expert who is a professor of virology at St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital, is that ''rather small changes in vital places can make the difference between life and death, as it were.''</p>
        <p>The question of what makes a flu virus turn deadly is of enormous concern to public health officials, who still shudder at what they consider a near miss of a vast epidemic  in Hong Kong in 1997.</p>
        <p>The virus then, of a type known as H5N1, first appeared among chickens being sold live in Hong Kong markets. Influenza is common in birds and usually of no consequence even to them. This virus, however, not only was killing chickens but  quickly appeared in humans as well.</p>
        <p>Members of an international team of researchers who rushed to Hong Kong were shocked by what they saw, and readily admitted that they feared the worst.</p>
        <p>''We were seeing young kids get hospitalized; we were seeing young adults get hospitalized, end up on respirators and die,'' said Dr. Keiji Fukuda of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And these, Dr. Fukuda said, were people who had been generally healthy. ''That was chilling,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Dr. Kennedy Shortridge, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, was investigating the ravaging of the chickens.</p>
        <p>''We saw a bird standing up there, pecking away at its food,'' Dr. Shortridge said, ''and then very gently fall over, lying on its side, looking dead. Blood was trickling.''</p>
        <p>''It was a very unreal, bizarre situation,'' he added. ''I had never seen anything like it.''</p>
        <p>He thought of the 1918 flu, one of the worst epidemics in history, which killed an estimated 40 million to 100 million people around the world in a single flu season.</p>
        <p>The virus of 1997 seemed gone for good after Hong Kong's chickens, nearly a million in all, were slaughtered. But it returned in chickens there this year, a development that led to a culling of them in May. Since then, said Dr. Robert Webster, a leading flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, it has come back yet again in the chickens, which are shipped from China.</p>
        <p>''It's just going to be impossible to clean all this up,'' said Dr. Taubenberger, of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the University of Wisconsin researchers were analyzing strains of the H5N1 virus from 1997. The investigators, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, Dr. Masato Hatta and colleagues, took advantage of an unusual feature of the virus: While most human flu viruses do not make mice ill, these strains generally affected mice and people in the same way. Those that killed people killed mice, in both cases spreading from the lungs to the brain and other organs. But other H5N1 strains that appeared in Hong Kong at the same time did not kill people or mice, and remained in the lungs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kawaoka explained that bird flu viruses sometimes acquire changes in a protein, hemagglutinin, that the virus needs to burst into cells and infect them. The change allows the virus to grow outside the lungs and the intestines, where bird flu viruses are usually contained,  and turns the virus lethal for birds.</p>
        <p>The Hong Kong virus infecting and killing chickens had acquired that hemagglutinin change. But, Dr. Kawaoka asked, why were strains of that virus, unlike most bird viruses, also able to grow so well in people?</p>
        <p>Using new methods of synthesizing live flu viruses in the laboratory, Dr. Kawaoka and his colleagues meticulously went through the Hong Kong virus's eight gene segments, switching a gene from a lethal strain with its counterpart in a nonlethal strain, and asking if the change made the new virus nonlethal to mice. They repeated the procedure  with different genes.</p>
        <p>They also did the reverse, starting with a nonlethal strain and replacing individual genes with counterparts from a lethal strain.</p>
        <p>The results led them to a particular gene, PB2, that is used in viral replication. They continued the substitution process on a finer scale, working this time at the level of the bases, the chemical units that make up a gene. That led them to a tiny  mutation that made all the difference. The lethal virus, they discovered, had an alteration in one base in that gene. That, Dr. Kawaoka said, let the bird virus grow in mice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lambert, of the infectious diseases institute, said the change in the PB2 gene also appeared to allow the chicken virus to infect people. And, she said, the lethal chicken strains in Hong Kong in 1997 already had the hemagglutinin change and were rapidly evolving to have the PB2 genetic change as well.</p>
        <p>Another paper, published in the same issue of Science, suggests a new hypothesis to explain why the flu virus that swept the world in 1918 was so deadly.</p>
        <p>In that hypothesis, proposed by Dr. Mark. J. Gibbs at the Australian National University in Canberra and his colleagues, the virus emerged when a human flu virus acquired a piece of a gene from a pig flu virus.</p>
        <p>But flu experts said the idea, while intriguing, required much more data to be convincing. ''It is a stretch,'' said Dr. Webster, of St. Jude.</p>
        <p>Dr. Taubenberger agreed. He is analyzing the 1918 virus by working with three samples. Two are from preserved lung tissue from American soldiers who died of the epidemic in military camps, and the third is from the lungs of an Alaskan woman who also died of it and whose lungs remained frozen and preserved because she was buried in permafrost.</p>
        <p>So far, Dr. Taubenberger and his colleagues have sequenced half the viral genes. But, he said, they have found nothing yet that would have made the 1918 virus so lethal.</p>
