        <p>When the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts is completed in December, it will be the latest and so far the grandest move to rejuvenate Philadelphia's downtown tourist district along Broad Street, the city's main north-south thoroughfare. The Kimmel Center will be home to several major performing companies, from the Philadelphia Orchestra to Philadanco, a dance company.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, theaters and galleries have moved to the area just south of City Hall on Broad Street, a stretch that has now been dubbed the Avenue of the Arts. But the orchestra's old home, the Academy of Music, will still be at the center of the scene at Broad and Locust Streets, with the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. It has been joined by the experimental Wilma Theater, the Prince Music Theater, renovated traditional theaters like the Merriam and the city's performing-arts high school, which occupies a Greek revival building. All this activity has spawned new, often high-end, restaurants and a hotel boom of sorts.</p>

        <p>When the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts is completed in December, it will be the latest and so far the grandest move to rejuvenate Philadelphia's downtown tourist district along Broad Street, the city's main north-south thoroughfare. The Kimmel Center will be home to several major performing companies, from the Philadelphia Orchestra to Philadanco, a dance company.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, theaters and galleries have moved to the area just south of City Hall on Broad Street, a stretch that has now been dubbed the Avenue of the Arts. But the orchestra's old home, the Academy of Music, will still be at the center of the scene at Broad and Locust Streets, with the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. It has been joined by the experimental Wilma Theater, the Prince Music Theater, renovated traditional theaters like the Merriam and the city's performing-arts high school, which occupies a Greek revival building. All this activity has spawned new, often high-end, restaurants and a hotel boom of sorts.</p>
        <p>The visual arts range from the old masters and Impressionists at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to new local talent at the monthly First Friday open-gallery shows in trendy Old City to the grass-roots city mural project that has turned 2,000 walls into people's art.</p>
        <p>While Philadelphia's theater district is not Broadway, it does offer  a mix of Broadway tryouts, national touring companies and regional the ater. Restaurants, including some adventuresome new ones, dot the walkable landscape. Nothing seems too far from everything else; a visitor's day can include an art show, a historic site, a play or musical performance, and a first-class meal.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Museum of Art, 26th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, www .phila museum.org, is featuring two Philadelphia-based artists this fall. For the first time in 20 years, the museum will have a full-blown exhibition of the city's most famous 19th-century artist, Thomas Eakins. ''Thomas Eakins: American Realist,'' Oct. 4 to Jan. 6, will include 60 of his oil paintings and more than 120 photographs by Eakins and his circle of artist friends, as well as his drawings, watercolors and sculpture. Another exhibition, from Oct. 27 to Feb. 24, 2002, highlights Dox Thrash, a midcentury African-American printmaker who came to Philadelphia with the Works Progress Administration arts program in 1936. Closed Monday. General admission $10.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Broad and Cherry Streets, (215) 972-7600, www.pafa.org, is housed in an 1876 rococo Frank Furness building just north of City Hall. Through Dec. 9 the galleries will  display 23 Medici portraits and busts from the Uffizi in Florence. The galleries are closed Monday; general admission $8.</p>
        <p>The Wilma Theater, Broad and Spruce Streets, (215) 546-7824, www .wilmatheater.org, moved across the street from the venerable Academy of Music in 1995 but maintained its largely experimental theater program. Running through Oct. 21 is ''Patience,'' by Jason Sherman and directed by the theater's co-founder, the Czech immigrant Blanka Zizka. It is a dark comedy about a corporate executive who has lost his way in the modern business world. Tickets, $28 to $39.</p>
        <p>At the Walnut Street Theater, Ninth and Walnut Streets, (215) 574-3550, www.wstonline.org, ''Camila,'' a musical by Lori McKelvey about a young woman who falls in love with a Jesuit priest in 19th-century Argentina, runs till Oct. 21. Tickets $10 to $55.</p>
        <p>The Prince Music Theater, 1412 Chestnut Street, (215) 569-9700, www.princemusictheater.org, which opened last year in a former movie palace, begins its season Sept. 29  with the torch singer Andrea Marcovicci in ''Lady in the Dark,'' written by Moss Hart, with music by Kurt Weill and lyrics by Ira Gershwin. Tickets, $40 to $45. The play runs through Oct. 20.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Among the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall and the rest of the sights  in Independence National Historical Park, in the eastern part of Center City, is an offbeat historic stop: Franklin Court, (215) 597-8974 and nps.gov/inde/Franklin_Court. To prepare for the Bicentennial, the Park Service commissioned the architect Robert Venturi to recreate Benjamin Franklin's house, razed in 1812 by his grandson, at Third and Chestnut Streets. Instead, Mr. Venturi designed a ''ghost house,'' a three-story skeletal frame with glassedin excavations of features like privy pits below. Underneath is the Franklin Underground Museum with slightly quirky dioramas of Franklin's missions to Europe and princess-style telephones where visitors can hear John Adams or Harry S. Truman give his views of Franklin. Admission free; open daily.</p>
        <p>Just around the corner is the National Liberty Museum, 321 Chestnut Street, (215) 925-2800, www.liberty museum.org. Opened last year by the publishing executive Irvin Borowsky, it is a paean to those who have strived for freedom. Interactive exhibits feature Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. Closed Monday; admission $5.</p>
        <p>You can toss a penny for good luck on Ben's grave in the auxiliary Christ Church graveyard at Fifth and Arch Streets.</p>
        <p>Across the street, at the United States Mint, (215) 408-0114, www.us mint.gov, is a free self-guided tour of coins being made (no free samples). Open Monday to Friday.</p>
        <p>Scattered throughout the city are the works of the Philadelphia Mural Arts Project, (215) 683-3689, www .muralarts.org. Begun in 1984 as an anti-graffiti campaign, the project now encompasses more than 2,000 walls.</p>
        <p>A McDonald's at Sixth and South Streets has a Brazilian jungle on its wall; on the corner of Green Street and Ridge Avenue on the northeast edge of Center City is a three-story portrait of Julius Erving in a tailored suit.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia's Italian Market, Ninth Street from Christian to Wharton Streets, is a gem, a scene out of an immigrant era. Recently renovated with new awnings, sidewalks and curbing, it is a milelong open-air produce, meat, fish and tchotchke market. Be sure to crowd into DiBruno's, 930 South Ninth Street, (215) 922-2876, and smell the dozens of varieties of cheese, olives and sausages. D'Angelo Brothers, 909 South Ninth Street, (215) 923-5637, has exotic meats like emu and ostrich.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The revival of the central part of Center City spurred by the Kimmel Center has brought a spate of inns into the mix of small commercial and residential buildings. One ultramodern entry, housed in a Georgian Revival building, is the 24-room Inn on Locust, 1234 Locust Street; (215) 985-1905, fax (215) 985-0945, www  .innonlocust.com. Desks, TV cabinets and sink stands are cherry and the lamps are tech-spare and pewter-toned. Beds fold into the walls. The rooms all have kitchenettes and DVD, and are on T-1 server lines. Doubles, $175 to $275.</p>
        <p>The Warwick Hotel, 1701 Locust Street, (215) 790-7781, fax (215) 789-6104, www.warwickhotels.com/phil, a 75-year-old landmark that is still well maintained, opened the day of the 1926 Dempsey-Tunney fight and for years thereafter was the premier sportsmen's and entertainers' hotel in Philadelphia. The 545 rooms, all with T-1 Internet access lines, have plush floral décor, with goosedown pillows and heavy comforters. The baths are marble. Doubles, $139 to $189.</p>
        <p>Budget: With its exposed brick walls and location in bustling Chinatown, the Clarion Suites, 1010 Race Street, (215) 922-1730, fax (215) 922-6258, www.choicehotels.com, has a lot of personality for a chain hotel. Its 96 suites, with modern furnishings, occupy a Victorian building, the former Heywood Brothers Furniture Company. Doubles, $89 to $189.</p>
        <p>The Society Hill Hotel, 301 Chestnut Street, (215) 925-1919, fax (215) 925-3780, www.societyhillhotel.com, sits atop a lively piano bar in an 1832 building two blocks from Independence Hall. Its 12 rooms are small but redeemed by brass beds and fresh flowers. Doubles from $85 to $175.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Quiet elegance is the hallmark of the 364-room Four Seasons Philadelphia, 1 Logan Square; (215) 963-1500, fax (215) 963-9562, www .fourseasons.com/philadelphia. Rooms are furnished in traditional style, accented by framed prints and flowers, and some overlook the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the fountain on Logan Square. It has top-flight restaurants and a spa with facials, aromatherapy, massage and a lap pool. Doubles $220 to $460.</p>
        <p>The Ritz-Carlton, 10 South Broad Street, (215) 735-7700, fax (215) 735-7710, www.ritzcarlton.com, occupies  a renovated bank building. Its rotunda lobby is studded with restaurants and the Club rooms on its top four floors have access to the old Girard Trust Bank boardroom, with magnificent views of the skyline. A small spa and fitness center offers massage, body wraps and paraffin treatments. There are 331 guest rooms, including 31 suites, decorated with floral prints, walnut armoires and desks. The bathrooms are marble. Doubles, $199 to $330.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Le Bec-Fin, 1523 Walnut Street, (215) 567-1000, has long been considered Philadelphia's most elegant (and most expensive) restaurant, with a $120 prix fixe dinner menu. But a three-course lunch costs $40 a person, and might include galette de crabe aux haricots verts, an exquisite version of a fisherman's crab cake. Service is excellent. Wines start at $30 a bottle. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $300.</p>
        <p>South Philadelphia's Italian neighborhood is known for its food and music. Natives of this crowded row-house area include Mario Lanza, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, Fabian and James Darren. Their music plays through the sound system of Felicia's, 1148 South 11th Street, (215) 755-9656.</p>
        <p>Pastas and soups are homemade. The crisp calamari come with a tangy red sauce, and veal dishes are hearty; fresh herbs and garlic are ubiquitous. Dinner for two with wine runs about $65.</p>
        <p>Alma de Cuba, 1623 Walnut Street, (215) 988-1799, is a trendy three-level spot serving food that is subtly spiced and spectacularly presented. Votive candles lend atmosphere. Fish entrees include a sugar-cane skewered tuna loin with a rum-garlic glaze over malanga mash and a smoked tuna belly escabeche ($26). A meal for two, with a modest wine, costs about $125.</p>
        <p>Valanni, 1229 Spruce Street, (215) 790-9494, is set in an old renovated deli in the residential section of Center City near the theaters. Specialties include lightly spiced fresh fish, from scallops to ahi tuna to mahi-mahi, and coconut chicken ($16). Dinner for two, with a glass of wine each: $80.</p>
        <p>The profusion of lunchtime stalls and food vendors at the Reading Terminal Market, 12th and Arch Streets, (215) 922-2317, includes Kamal's Middle Eastern Specialties (215) 925-1511 for falafel, Delilah's (215) 574-0929 for Southern specialties, Jill's Vorspeise (215) 925-5415 for fresh and unusual sandwiches, and Termini Brothers Bakery (215) 629-1790 for cannoli.</p>
        <p>Everyone in Philadelphia has a favorite place for cheesesteaks, but closest to Center City, Jim's Steaks, 400 South Street, (215) 928-1911, is probably the most atmospheric --  all black-and-white tile with autographed testimonials by personalities from Bruce Willis to seemingly every known ballplayer. A Jim's steak ''with'' (with fried onions) and ''Whiz'' (slathered with Cheez Whiz) costs less than $6.</p>
