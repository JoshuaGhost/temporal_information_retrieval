        <p>Using a laser-based instrument, scientists are making accurate topographic images of ground zero, in hopes that they can help firefighters and rescue workers navigate the mounds and chasms of debris and identify areas that may shift or collapse.</p>
        <p>A week ago, with billows of gray smoke still pouring from the remnants of the World Trade Center, a twin-propeller plane flew 5,000 feet overhead, bouncing pulses of infrared laser light off the scarred terrain below.</p>
        <p>The resulting pictures show craters that drop at least 30 feet below street level. A corner of a jagged wall is what remains of the 110-story south tower. Even less sticks up from the site of the north tower.</p>
        <p>''This was the first clear view of the damaged area,'' said Sean C. Ahearn, director of the Center for the Analysis and Research of Spatial Information at Hunter College, where researchers are transforming the data collected by the instrument into haunting three-dimensional images of devastation.</p>
        <p>''It's so unreal that it takes a while to register what has happened.''</p>
        <p>Seven World Trade Center, once 47 stories high, ''is just a pile,'' said Jeffrey H. Bliss, a research assistant at the center. ''It's a round mound instead of a square building.''</p>
        <p>On the buildings still standing, the instrument detects piles of debris on the roofs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ahearn printed out a 52-by-80-inch copy for firefighters and rescue workers. ''On the ground, you don't get the same understanding of what the terrain is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The researchers are also looking for day-to-day changes that may indicate sinking of the ground or an unstable building foundation. So far, everything appears relatively stable.</p>
        <p>The laser-based instrument, known as lidar, short for ''light detection and ranging,'' is similar to radar, except that it uses laser light instead of radio waves. It sends a laser pulse to the ground and measures the time it takes to travel back, a round-trip excursion that lasts a hundred-thousandth of a second, more or less, depending on the height of objects that the pulse strikes on the ground.</p>
        <p>A global positioning instrument on the airplane tracks its exact location and altitude, and that data is combined to give elevations accurate to within six inches, said Bryan J. Logan, chief executive of EarthData International, the company that is collecting the data.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration granted EarthData permission to make daily flights in the tightly controlled airspace over the site. Each day since Sept. 15, EarthData's plane has passed over Lower Manhattan, shooting 15,000 laser pulses a second. EarthData then produces a grid of more than 100,000 points of topographic elevations, spaced about five feet apart, over the trade center area. The information is then analyzed by the researchers at Hunter College.</p>
        <p>Other instruments on the EarthData plane are taking photographs and measuring thermal radiation emanating from the surface to track the underground fires. The fires, which warm the surface 30 degrees above surrounding areas, are still burning beneath the rumble of the two towers and 7 World Trade Center. The hot spots can flare up as debris is removed, endangering people at the site.</p>
        <p>The fires spread outward on the first couple of days, but have since started to recede. ''But they're still extensive,'' Mr. Logan said.</p>
