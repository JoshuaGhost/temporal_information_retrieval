        <p>The world's governments expressed solidarity tonight with the United States as a democracy under attack, and European Union foreign ministers and NATO ambassadors planned separate meetings on Wednesday to discuss what can be done in a common battle against terrorism.</p>
        <p>There was quiet discussion among European officials tonight about how, in the event that the United States struck back at whomever was responsible, European governments and even militaries could assist. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also expressed support for retaliation.</p>
        <p>Giving expression to a sentiment voiced across the continent, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, called the attacks ''a declaration of war against the entire civilized world,'' and he spoke today with leaders of France, Russia and Britain about a coordinated European response.</p>
        <p>After months in which tensions between the United States and Europe had raised fears of a schism in the Atlantic alliance, criticism of President Bush and his foreign policy, in particular his plans for missile defense, was silenced today.</p>
        <p>''It shows we must stick together,'' said Karsten Voigt, a foreign policy adviser to the German chancellor. ''We hope the United States is learning that it does not stand alone.''</p>
        <p>As word spread of the attacks, countries moved quickly to secure American embassies and institutions on their soil. Flights from Europe, Asia and Latin America to the United States were called back or suspended, disrupting travel and commerce for thousands, and stock markets throughout Europe collapsed today with the news.</p>
        <p>It was ''one of those few days in a life that one can actually say will change everything,'' said Chris Patten, the European Union's external relations commissioner. He called the attacks ''an act of war by a madman.''</p>
        <p>Expressions of revulsion and condolence poured forth from all quarters. The French president, Jacques Chirac, cut short a visit to Brittany to return to Paris, saying he felt ''immense emotion'' over these ''monstrous bombings,'' and he said that the French ''are entirely with the American people.''</p>
        <p>France put its security forces on alert, placing more army and police presence on roads, borders and airports.</p>
        <p>The British prime minister, Tony Blair, expressed disgust, saying: ''This mass terrorism is the new evil in our world today.'' He called an emergency meeting of security officials to discuss what a Defense Ministry official called ''a pretty serious crisis,'' and airliners were diverted from flight paths over central London.</p>
        <p>The conservative prime minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, said, ''We won't be afraid to confront the terrorists. He said that Italy was with America in its sorrow and would be with America in its response.</p>
        <p>In a telegram to President Bush, Mr. Putin promised support for retaliation against those responsible. ''Such an inhuman act must not go unpunished,'' he wrote. ''The entire international community should unite in the struggle against terrorism.''</p>
        <p>Through its official news agency, Xinhua, China expressed its ''horror'' at the terrorist attack, and President Jiang Zemin sent a message of sympathy to President Bush and the victims, and expressed his ''grave concern'' for the safety of Chinese nationals in the United States.</p>
        <p>The NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, said the attacks ''constitute intolerable aggression against democracy and underline the need for the international community and the members of the alliance to unite their forces in fighting the scourge of terrorism.''</p>
        <p>The security chief of the European Union, Javier Solana, said: ''Consultations are under way on both sides of the Atlantic, and the European Union stands firmly and fully behind the United States.''</p>
        <p>In Asia, the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, moved to tighten security around American bases -- 50,000 American soldiers are stationed in Japan -- and told Mr. Bush: ''This sort of terrorism will never be forgiven and we feel strong anger.''</p>
        <p>The South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, meanwhile, put Korean armed forces on alert.</p>
        <p>President Vincente Fox of Mexico said he sent President Bush ''our feeling of sorrow and solidarity.'' The United States did not close its 2,000-mile border with Mexico, but traffic slowed at 27 checkpoints as security was tightened.</p>
        <p>Karl Kaiser, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations and a Schröder adviser, said that the openness of democratic societies has been ''bought at the price of vulnerability, vulnerability so high that you can conduct a war inside democracies.''</p>
        <p>For the first time since the British burned down the White House and the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, he said, ''the Americans experience what Europeans have experienced: war on home territory.'' Those responsible would be identified, he said. ''Then America will strike, and hopefully not alone.''</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II also condemned the attacks in a message to Mr. Bush, calling them ''an unspeakable horror.'' The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, said the attack was ''a tremendous warning to civilization'' that ''challenges us to mobilize, supremely, our sense of responsibility for this world.''</p>
        <p>Others said they thought that the attack would increase American support for new defenses of all kinds, including missile defenses.</p>
        <p>But Ernst-Otto Czempiel, director of Frankfurt's Peace Research Institute, said that Washington's view of the enemy must change. ''The enemy is not the state that will send long-range missiles against the United States, but the political group that feels threatened or damaged by American actions, and finds a way to hurt the United States. I hope the view will prevail that this kind of terrorism can only be solved by solving the political problems from which it lives and benefits.''</p>
        <p>François Loncle, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the French Parliament, said that the attacks were the result of an underestimation by the West of the problems in the Mideast. Washington, he said, should pay ''a little more and a little better attention to world affairs.''</p>
