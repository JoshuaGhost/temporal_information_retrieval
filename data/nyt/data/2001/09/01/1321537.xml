      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Afghanistan's ruling Taliban closed the offices of two Christian aid groups today, continuing a crackdown on workers accused of proselytizing.</p>
        <p>But unlike the case of Shelter Now, in which 24 aid workers were arrested earlier this month, no one was immediately taken into custody.</p>
        <p>Rather, Taliban officials said foreigners with the two agencies -- the International Assistance Mission and Serve -- had been given 72 hours to leave the country.</p>
        <p>No employees of either aid group were available for comment, with many of them said to be heading for the Pakistani border; nor were the Taliban saying much other than to confirm that they had shut down the two organizations.</p>
        <p>''No one is left here, and we are not allowed to let any foreigners in,'' a Taliban guard told reporters who went to the gate of the International Assistance Mission, an American-based group that ran two eye hospitals and several clinics. ''All foreigners left this morning after we closed the offices.''</p>
        <p>For weeks the Taliban have asserted that the Shelter Now case was merely a part of a ''larger conspiracy'' by aid groups to convert Muslims to Christianity. But while this latest action expands the number of agencies involved, the tactics used this time by the Taliban were relatively restrained.</p>
        <p>Eight foreigners -- two Americans, two Australians and four Germans -- and 16 Afghans are still being held after the raids on Shelter Now, a German-based group. This week the Taliban said each would face trial, though no dates were given. Those found guilty may face the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The International Assistance Mission has a long history in Afghanistan. Its work has included the distribution of food and the provision of shelter. Serve is involved in projects related to health and housing.</p>
        <p>At least in the case of the International Assistance Mission, the Taliban's action came as no surprise. When Taliban officials announced that they were broadening their investigation, many people in aid organizations assumed that the passionately Christian assistance mission would be a target.</p>
        <p>After 22 years of war and 4 years of drought, Afghanistan is perhaps the world's neediest country. Hundreds of relief groups and the United Nations spend more than $800,000 a day on care for the nation's beleaguered population.</p>
        <p>The need far outstrips the aid, and the Taliban and the aid agencies have often quarreled about who should be in charge of the money and how aid workers ought to act in a devoutly Muslim country with stringent rules of behavior.</p>
