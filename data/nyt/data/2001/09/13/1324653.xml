        <p>A 10-year-old boy is afraid to go back to his school -- ever. A 7-year-old girl wants to know whether the World Trade Center will be rebuilt, and insists that it was empty and that no one was hurt, despite her parents' gentle attempts to tell her the truth.</p>
        <p>A boy at Stuyvesant High School watched from a window of the school library as people fell or jumped to their deaths from the burning twin towers a few blocks south. A classmate standing next to him crossed himself every time a body catapulted into empty air. And the boy, who is Jewish, wished that he could do something, if only to make such symbolic gestures himself.</p>
        <p>They were among hundreds of schoolchildren in Lower Manhattan who witnessed the attack on the World Trade Center on Tuesday. Some were still lining up in playgrounds to go into classes as the first plane slammed into the north tower; others had front-row views from the windows of their classrooms; a few were still walking to school holding their parents' hands as the horrific scene unfolded in the sky before them.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, parents across the country were struggling to help their children make sense of an act that was beyond the experience of most adults, let alone children. But the children most traumatized were probably those at schools like Public School 234 and Stuyvesant, just a few blocks north of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>''A lot of parents worked at the World Trade Center,'' said Tracey Harden, whose son, Ross, 10, attends P.S. 234. As she picked up her son from school Tuesday morning, she said, ''There were kids screaming, 'Is my mother dead?' ''</p>
        <p>The children whose parents were able to pick them up were the lucky ones. Those who remained behind were marched like a column of refugees under police escort from TriBeCa to P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village. Lunchroom workers carried little children piggyback, one mother said.</p>
        <p>Public and Catholic schools will reopen today, two hours later than usual, except those south of 14th Street, which will remain closed.</p>
        <p>Unlike city schools, some suburban schools were open yesterday. Outside Mamaroneck High School, Jeff Holden, 15, waited to meet a friend on a bench.</p>
        <p>''A lot of kids have been hurt by this,'' he said. ''A lot of kids have parents who worked down there.''</p>
        <p>The blocks around P.S. 234 were cordoned off by the city yesterday. Some residents had left to stay with relatives and friends. Others kept their children inside, afraid of flying asbestos and dust and reluctant to let their children see the devastated cityscape.</p>
        <p>Noelle Hollanders, whose two daughters attend P.S. 234, had just kissed her older daughter, Isabelle, 11, goodbye in the school playground and was going to buy a newspaper across the street when she heard a plane's roar directly over Greenwich Street, where P.S. 234 is located.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'What a nut; he better turn quick,' and he didn't. He just punctured the tower like a cookie cutter.''</p>
        <p>As she watched, a man ran off to throw up, abandoning his baby in a carriage. She grabbed the carriage and pressed it against a wall, fearing an explosion. When the father returned, she rushed into the school to retrieve her daughters.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Hollanders, her two daughters and another mother and daughter walked home, the towers began collapsing behind them, and the two 11-year-old girls began screaming hysterically.</p>
        <p>''I went to Mike, the nice Pakistani at the newsstand, and bought M&amp;M's and orange sodas, all this forbidden stuff,'' Ms. Hollanders said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, her 7-year-old, Marguerite, wanted to know what it felt like to die, and if the towers would be rebuilt. ''We told her they might make a garden or a symphony, something beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hollanders said she knew of three or four P.S. 234 families with parents missing, and could not conceive how the school would deal with the tragedy in the days and weeks to come.</p>
        <p>Another parent, Chris Boeke, said her daughter, Caroline, 7, attended P.S. 234 with a boy who was not able to sleep Tuesday night, because ''every time he closed his eyes, he saw people jumping out of the building again.''</p>
        <p>One father said that when his children woke up yesterday morning, the two older boys, 7 and 6, took their mattresses off their beds and propped them up side by side, like twin towers. Then they invited the 2-year-old to knock them down.</p>
        <p>But some children hid their feelings. As Ms. Harden ran from her apartment to pick up her son, Ross, ''I saw the bodies dropping,'' she said. ''I don't know if he did or not. I don't want to tell him if he doesn't know.''</p>
        <p>Her son, she said, ''says he doesn't want to go back to school, to any school.''</p>
        <p>Max Mecklenburg, the student at Stuyvesant who watched the bodies fall and wished he could cross himself, went to Central Park with friends yesterday to try to forget. ''These children have images in their brains that are pretty intense,'' his mother, Atina, said. ''You wonder, what are the consequences?''</p>
