        <p>Marlpit Hall in Middletown Township, built in 1756, is an unusually long house that opens onto a side yard rather than onto Kings Highway. The Taylor family owned the property until the mid-1930's when a Monmouth County woman, Margaret Haskell, purchased and restored the property for the Monmouth County Historical Association. The association has spent the past eight years making structural repairs and restoring the interior to the way it looked when it was first built. The house reopened to the public last month and a grand opening celebration is scheduled for Sept. 16. The house is open on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lee Ellen Griffith, director of the Monmouth County Historical Association, talked recently about the house.</p>

        <p>Marlpit Hall in Middletown Township, built in 1756, is an unusually long house that opens onto a side yard rather than onto Kings Highway. The Taylor family owned the property until the mid-1930's when a Monmouth County woman, Margaret Haskell, purchased and restored the property for the Monmouth County Historical Association. The association has spent the past eight years making structural repairs and restoring the interior to the way it looked when it was first built. The house reopened to the public last month and a grand opening celebration is scheduled for Sept. 16. The house is open on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lee Ellen Griffith, director of the Monmouth County Historical Association, talked recently about the house.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the history of the Marlpit?</p>
        <p>A. A house was built on this property in 1686 by James Grover Jr., whose father had been given the land by an English governor who wanted to encourage settlement in the area. But that building was torn down by John Taylor and replaced with Marlpit Hall, which was completed in 1756. It was the work of two different carpenters, one much more skilled than the other. The difference in construction between the two is evident. The more skilled carpenter used traditional pegged mortise and tenon construction and did most of the interior woodwork. Then a new owner took over and a new carpenter reverted to plain butted joints and did some of the molding, but in an awkward manner. The building is a synthesis of Dutch and English building styles. The house is named for a naturally occurring soil deposit made of clay, sand and limestone that was used for fertilizer, which is found in a band from here to Freehold.</p>
        <p>Q. What happened to the family after they lost Marlpit Hall?</p>
        <p>A. The Taylor family eventually regained the house and lived there until they built another, larger home farther up the hill, which we call the Taylor-Butler home, which was completed in 1853. They then used Marlpit Hall for tenant farmers for their apple and peach orchards. The Taylor-Butler house, which the Historical Association also owns, is a Victorian structure that was obviously built to impress people. It is available for rent for special occasions.</p>
        <p>Q. What has the historical association done with Marlpit Hall?</p>
        <p>A. The house was given to the association in the 1930's and was open for tours for many years, but it had been moved in 1911 to make way for a change to Kings Highway and after being open for all those years it needed repairs. We made all the structural repairs and restored it to its original interior. We are furnishing it in 18th-century style with some of the Taylor family's original furniture, which has been in storage, and some rooms will be furnished as it was when Mrs. Haskell gave it to us in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>Q. What was the family's role in the Revolutionary War?</p>
        <p>A. During the Revolutionary War Monmouth County was divided about half and half between Colonists and Loyalists. The Taylors were Loyalists. During the war, Edward Taylor passed information about the location of Continental militia to his son, George, a colonel in a Loyalist army unit that raided neighbors' homes. Edward Taylor was arrested and confined to Marlpit Hall for the duration of the war. This was a terrible time in the county when neighbor was pitted against neighbor. The Taylors lost most of their wealth and social status after the war. It was not until years later they regained their prosperity by importing goods from China.</p>
