        <p>As the United States prepares its response to last week's terrorist attacks, many military analysts say that the NATO alliance, though it has pledged its support, at least politically, has very little to offer the United States militarily.</p>
        <p>Few European countries have the resources to conduct a war far from home. Few have special forces  trained to do the kind of quick, surgical missions analysts believe the United States would want to conduct against targets like terrorist training camps on other continents.</p>
        <p>Instead, experts say, the United States is far more likely to call on only a few European allies, finding enough partners to build the moral authority of an international coalition, but avoiding the sometimes clumsy mechanics of the 19-member alliance.</p>
        <p>Washington has yet to announce its response to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But even without seeing the details many experts believe that the United States wanted only a show of support from NATO and may not ask for much else.</p>
        <p>''The United States needed the political consensus and they got a very important one,'' said Jonathan Eyal, the director of studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London, referring to NATO's decision last week to invoke a mutual defense clause in its founding treaty for the first time in its 49-year history. ''Other than that, however, the United States does not really need NATO.''</p>
        <p>With thousands of troops in the Balkans, NATO is already stretched. But experts say that the United States would not be looking for conventional troops like these, but rather for those specially trained for  ''search and destroy'' missions. Such troops are still available among the allies. But there are not very many of them.</p>
        <p>''NATO forces are not training for this kind of work,'' said Rob de Wijk, a military analyst at the Dutch Institute of International Relations.  ''There are only maybe a couple thousand in all of Europe, maybe a couple hundred in the Netherlands.''  Mr. de Wijk says that the British and the French have the most special forces personnel and are the only two European countries capable of supporting their armies far from home.</p>
        <p>When it comes to hardware, the United States might be using fighter planes and missiles, for instance, and the French and British are the most likely to be able to help. But their arsenals are small in comparison with that of the United States.</p>
        <p>Recent NATO efforts like the war on Kosovo brought home the difficulties of working with a large coalition. In that campaign, getting a consensus on what targets to bomb proved long and difficult. Nor was it easy, with so many people around the conference table, to keep the targets secret. Moreover, as each country has its own training and equipment, it is hard for them to work together.</p>
        <p>With widely different military and economic abilities, and political agendas that vary depending on history and geography, NATO allies often have trouble reaching consensus. The members have been squabbling for years over how to pay for an advanced airborne surveillance system.</p>
        <p>Even European leaders who want to help may find it difficult. Germany and Belgium, for instance, face legal restrictions on the number of troops they can send outside of the country. Belgium has a limit of 1,000 soldiers, and it has already deployed that number in the Balkans.</p>
        <p>The Europeans were extraordinarily quick in issuing statements of solidarity. But within days of invoking the mutual defense clause, many NATO allies appeared to be qualifying their support. Across the Continent, European leaders were urging American restraint.</p>
        <p>Far closer to the Arab world and with larger Muslim populations, European countries worry that military action by the United States could  lead to more terrorism that would inevitably hit them as well.</p>
        <p>Technically, the mutual defense clause, Article V, does not commit NATO allies to much: the United States wanted it that way when the treaty was written in 1949. The clause was intended to protect Europe, a way of binding the United States to future action if the Continent was attacked. Instead, to most everyone's surprise, the United States would be the first to benefit.</p>
        <p>But some experts said the importance of invoking the clause should not be overlooked. Mr. Eyal said that for years a debate has raged over whether NATO could even act outside of Europe. But in less than 30 hours that issue was resolved, greatly enlarging the territory where NATO might take future action.</p>
        <p>Some experts say also that NATO will have to tackle what has been until now a mainly philosophical debate about what role it should play in combating terrorism. The alliance does not have an intelligence capacity of its own. Most countries have until now been cautious with each other, despite promises to share intelligence.</p>
        <p>''We are going to have to learn as we go,'' said François L. Heisbourg, director of the French Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris.</p>
        <p>''We can't even officially call it a war. For one thing, that would make terrorists soldiers, not murderers.''</p>
