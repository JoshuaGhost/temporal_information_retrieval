        <p>Federal agents searching for a suspected operative of Osama bin Laden have arrested three men in Detroit after a search of their house uncovered airport-employee identification badges and a date book with hand-drawn diagrams of aircraft and runways.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. agents found the material as they sought Nabil al Marabh, who, according to a federal affidavit filed on Tuesday, was on ''a list of suspects, potential associates of the suspects and potential witnesses'' in the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether the three men, all North African immigrants, had any role in the plot. Two of them had worked as dishwashers for an airport contractor, Sky Chefs, but a company spokesman said their passes did not give them access to secured areas of the airport. They were held on charges of possessing false immigration documents.</p>
        <p>The arrests came as federal authorities hunted across the country for accomplices of the hijackers.</p>
        <p>Officials said they had concluded that Mohamed Atta, who was aboard the American Airlines flight that slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center, was emerging as a central figure in the plot.</p>
        <p>But after dozens of arrests and hundreds of interviews, the officials said they had not determined if Mr. Atta was the ringleader.</p>
        <p>If he was, officials said, the hijacking would be something of a departure from previous attacks attributed to Al Qaeda, the loose network of radical fundamentalists that Mr. bin Laden established in the late 1980's. In several earlier operations, a senior operative has overseen final preparations before slipping away as the plot was carried out.</p>
        <p>Attorney General John Ashcroft said today that the hijackers and their accomplices probably had support from foreign governments. The comments were the first by Mr. Ashcroft suggesting that the terrorists had operated with state sanction.</p>
        <p>''It is pretty clear that the networks that conduct these kind of events are harbored, supported, sustained and protected by a variety of foreign governments,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But a senior American official said Mr. Ashcroft's comments were discussed later in an interagency conference call. Several officials appeared reluctant to endorse his remarks, indicating that Mr. Ashcroft might not have meant there was new or conclusive evidence of state sponsorship in the attacks.</p>
        <p>American intelligence officials say that, while they continue to look for evidence of state backing, the bulk of the information points to Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>As the search for accomplices moved forward, other aspects of the sprawling case continued to unfold. The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested trading records from several major investment houses to determine whether any of the terrorists might have tried to profit by trading in options on airline and insurance companies.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials, however, appear to have little solid evidence tying Mr. bin Laden's group to the attacks. One of the few links they have cited privately is Mr. al Marabh, who they said had unspecified ties to two hijackers.</p>
        <p>United States officials had previously linked Mr. al Marabh to a former Boston cab driver now jailed in Jordan on charges of plotting attacks on tourist and holy sites there on the eve of the millennium celebrations. The attacks were foiled by Jordanian authorities, who said the plans were ordered by one of Mr. bin Laden's top lieutenants.</p>
        <p>Since the attacks on Sept. 11, F.B.I. agents have questioned former friends and associates of Mr. al Marabh, 34, including cab drivers at the Boston Cab Company, where he worked for several years.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. al Marabh's wife said F.B.I. agents had questioned her husband in August of 1999, looking for a friend of his.</p>
        <p>In Boston today, F.B.I. agents interviewed a 28-year-old woman who said she had dated Mr. al Marabh for six months last year.</p>
        <p>The woman, who spoke on the condition she be identified only by her first name, Kristin, recalled that after the terrorist bombing of the destroyer Cole last year, Mr. al Marabh had told her that ''there were fundamentalist groups that take the Koran and twist it to suit their own needs.''</p>
        <p>The woman said she learned of the investigators' interest in Mr. al Marabh after spotting his name on a Web site. ''The first thing I did was throw up,'' she said. ''The second thing I did was call the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>Records show that Mr. al Marabh was arrested last year after stabbing a man who was staying with his family. A Boston police report said the wounded man, Arafat Abjib, had told the police that Mr. al Marabh had yelled, ''If this wasn't America, I would kill you!''</p>
        <p>Mr. al Marabh disappeared after he was convicted on assault charges in December 2000, his lawyer said today.</p>
        <p>From the scores of people questioned this week, the broad scope of the inquiry was apparent.</p>
        <p>A Muslim cleric who was accused by the authorities of serving as an intermediary for followers of Osama bin Laden was interviewed today in Washington for three hours.</p>
        <p>The cleric, Moataz Al-Hallak, has never been charged with terrorism but was being sought recently by the F.B.I. for questioning. ''I have answered each and every question they asked of me,'' Mr. Al-Hallak said by phone after leaving the session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Hallak would not describe the questioning, but his lawyer, Stanley L. Cohen, said his client told the prosecutors that he had heard nothing in advance to suggest that an  attack would occur. He said Mr. Al-Hallak could not identify any of about 20 photographs he was shown.</p>
        <p>The rest of the questions were sweeping, Mr. Cohen said. ''It was really, as Moataz has said, shaking the proverbial Muslim tree.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for United States Attorney Mary Jo White declined to comment. In a 1999 court hearing, a federal prosecutor described Mr. Al-Hallak ''as a contact between members of the bin Laden organization.''</p>
