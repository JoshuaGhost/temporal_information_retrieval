        <p>When times were good, executives did not hesitate to reach for the brass ring, even if it should have been beyond their grasp. Now that many of them are worrying more about job security than remodeling their retirement homes, they have become more willing to scale back their ambitions.</p>
        <p>Since the economy soured, a huge majority of executives are willing to accept demotions or jobs they think are below their abilities, according to a survey by Drake Beam Morin, an outplacement company. Fueling their new flexibility is the surge in job hunting colleagues. Christian &amp; Timbers, an executive search firm, has received three times as many résumés from executives this year as it did at this time last year.</p>
        <p>Like the consultants at Drake Beam, Bob Lambert, a managing director at Christian &amp; Timbers, feels that many of these executives have to adjust their expectations. ''Some of the résumés we've received are from executives who, if it weren't for the turbo-charged growth rate of the dot-com markets, would never have been given executive titles at all,'' Mr. Lambert said.</p>
        <p>''Corporations are looking for depth of experience and a proven track record,'' he added. ''Unless the people circulating their résumés this year can offer this kind of proof, they will need to readjust their thinking about the types of jobs they can hope to land.''</p>
