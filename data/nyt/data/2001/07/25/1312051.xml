        <p>Apish Behavior Off Screen, Too</p>
        <p>It was a zoo, the ''Planet of the Apes'' screening Monday night.</p>
        <p>The special showing of the remake of the 1968 sci-fi film drew cast members MARK WAHLBERG and HELENA BONHAM CARTER; the film's director, TIM BURTON; and celebrities including SEAN COMBS, SHAQUILLE O'NEAL and -- a last-minute surprise -- CHARLTON HESTON. But the sound-bite crowd, the photographers and camera operators who cover such events, had a tense moment or two while jockeying for interview positions outside the Ziegfeld Theater. One television cameraman grabbed a ''reserved'' sign from the barricade that had been set aside for JEANNIE WILLIAMS of USA Today. ''I've never seen anybody who was so rude,'' she said, though she added that he apologized later.</p>

        <p>Apish Behavior Off Screen, Too</p>
        <p>It was a zoo, the ''Planet of the Apes'' screening Monday night.</p>
        <p>The special showing of the remake of the 1968 sci-fi film drew cast members MARK WAHLBERG and HELENA BONHAM CARTER; the film's director, TIM BURTON; and celebrities including SEAN COMBS, SHAQUILLE O'NEAL and -- a last-minute surprise -- CHARLTON HESTON. But the sound-bite crowd, the photographers and camera operators who cover such events, had a tense moment or two while jockeying for interview positions outside the Ziegfeld Theater. One television cameraman grabbed a ''reserved'' sign from the barricade that had been set aside for JEANNIE WILLIAMS of USA Today. ''I've never seen anybody who was so rude,'' she said, though she added that he apologized later.</p>
        <p>Placement turned out to be a problem inside the theater, too, where the soap-opera actor MARK CONSUELOS was playing cub reporter for his wife, KELLY RIPA, above, of ''Live With Regis and Kelly.'' She stayed home with their new baby, but sent him to gather information so she could sound knowledgeable when she interviewed the cast on television.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Consuelos was told to give up his seat to Mr. Burton. Mr. Consuelos pulled out his cell phone, called home and gave the phone to the person who ordered him out. Ms. Ripa said that the woman promised to invite her to many future events. Her reply: ''We won't be coming.''</p>
        <p>The singer SAMANTHA COLE said that she, too, was ejected. ''Suddenly they said I had to move to another seat,'' she said. ''But the movie was ready to start, and there were no other seats, so I didn't see the movie.''</p>
        <p>So is Mr. Burton thinking about a sequel? ''I'd rather jump out of a window right now,'' he said at a party after the screening.</p>
        <p>A Four Seasons Bargain Lunch</p>
        <p>The pillars of the power-lunch crowd were invited to pose for a photograph yesterday in a power-lunch place, the Four Seasons restaurant. What they did not know -- and yes, this sounds like one of those Folger's coffee commercials -- was that the hot dogs served to HENRY A. KISSINGER and MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG were prepared not in the restaurant's kitchen, but at a hot-dog stand outside the restaurant.</p>
        <p>''It cost me $20 for 20 hot dogs,'' said JULIAN NICCOLINI, an owner of the restaurant, adding that the photo food was special fare. ''When they eat here, they have regular Four Seasons food.''</p>
        <p>Some did have regular Four Seasons food: BARBARA WALTERS, for example, who left her lunch companion -- DAVID WESTIN, the president of ABC News -- waiting while she faced the camera. The photo session was for Talk magazine, which is owned by Miramax (like ABC, a unit of Disney) and Hearst.</p>
        <p>A Mania for Pianos</p>
        <p>How do authors kill time between speeches and signings on a book tour? THAD CARHART, the author of ''The Piano Shop on the Left Bank,'' visited a piano shop on the left coast. In Oakland, Calif., a piano technician led Mr. Carhart to a 1927 Steinway grand. The keys were rebalanced when the piano was rebuilt recently, Mr. Carhart said, describing an intricate operation that left the piano light and lovely.</p>
        <p>''I'm no great shakes as a pianist,'' he said, ''but it was so entirely even that it took my breath away. It was so strange a sensation, like somebody saying, 'Here, why don't you just fly?' and you didn't know you could. It felt as if I were Horowitz.''</p>
        <p>Pinter's Elevated Language</p>
        <p>JIM CARREY checked out the HAROLD PINTER play ''The Homecoming'' (part of the Lincoln Center Festival) at the John Jay College Theater the other day. At intermission, Mr. Carrey, left, was heard describing Pinter dialogue as ''stylized language'' and was seen shaking hands with MIKE NICHOLS and his wife, DIANE SAWYER. Mr. Carrey skipped a post-performance discussion featuring three directors -- KAREL REISZ, ROBIN LEFEVRE and GARI JONES, who said that audiences tended to overintellectualize Mr. Pinter's work. But look who's talking: he also said that he once named a car ''Harold.''</p>
