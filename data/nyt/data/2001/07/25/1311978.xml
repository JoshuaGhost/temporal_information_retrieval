        <p>Angela Williams began her speech at a conference for female corporate lawyers in May with an apology. Her assistant had sent over the wrong biography, describing her as a Baptist minister rather than a lawyer. In reality, she said, she was both.</p>
        <p>She was a lawyer first. Ms. Williams, 37, got her degree from the University of Texas School of Law in 1988 and then joined the Air Force, where she tried courts-martial. In 1995, she became a federal prosecutor in Central Florida, handling cases like arsons at black churches. She loved her work, but when she traveled to Jerusalem in 1996 and visited sites she knew from a lifetime of reading the Bible, she was overcome with a desire to dedicate herself full time to the ministry.</p>
        <p>''My call was an overwhelming and humbling experience,'' she said in an interview. ''One of my first prayers to God was, 'Am I still to practice law?' And I believe wholeheartedly that the answer I received was yes.''</p>
        <p>Two years later, she enrolled in the Samuel Dewitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University and discovered the challenges of balancing two careers. She had recently been named a special counsel on the Judiciary Committee staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, and her reputation as a dogged prosecutor with deep religious beliefs prompted him to introduce her to people as the lawyer who ''puts them in jail in the morning and prays for them at night.''</p>
        <p>During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Ms. Williams recalls sitting in Senator Kennedy's office with one eye on the televised hearings and the other on her theology texts, preparing for final exams.</p>
        <p>Today, life remains an intense mix of serving the law and serving the Lord. Ms. Williams puts in about 50 hours during the week as a corporate lawyer at the Washington firm of Bryan Cave and anywhere from 10 to 40 hours in the evenings and on weekends as an associate minister at the Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington. She also does guest preaching.</p>
        <p>Pursuing two unrelated white-collar occupations nearly full time, as Ms. Williams is doing, may be unusual, but workplace experts say it is not as rare as it used to be. ''In working-class communities, people always did more than one thing, but it was generally a survival issue,'' said Belinda Plutz, a Manhattan career counselor. And of course, aspiring artists and actors have always had day jobs. But now, Ms. Plutz says, more professional people are blending two careers to satisfy their souls.</p>
        <p>Daniel Pink, author of ''Free Agent Nation'' (Warner Books, 2001), which is about the increasing prevalence of independent workers, says ''bivocational'' people like Ms. Williams are offshoots of a broader trend.</p>
        <p>''Now that people are comfortable changing careers during their work lives, some are switching between careers during their workweeks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For nearly 20 years, Rashid Silvera has been teaching high school social studies in Scarsdale, N.Y., and earning a second income as a professional model. His bearded face has graced the covers of magazines like GQ and Essence.</p>
        <p>His teaching job makes him hard to book for modeling assignments much of the year and forces him to miss seasonal fashion shows in Paris and Milan, but he says that is actually an advantage.</p>
        <p>''The coolest thing you can be is unavailable,'' said Mr. Silvera, who is 54.</p>
        <p>What motivates some people to inhabit two work spheres that seemingly have nothing in common? Their answer is usually that there is something in common.</p>
        <p>''The interaction between the two is so clear,'' Ms. Williams said. ''In fact, if you look at the core of the legal profession and the core of Christianity, the one common thread is justice.'' The synthesis dates back to biblical times, she said, when priests were the jurists who listened to disputes and rendered decisions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams says her law firm colleagues view her as someone they can turn to in a crisis, and she jokes they get double protection because both her professions have confidentiality rules. When she joined Bryan Cave, she made her commitment to her second job clear, and the firm's managing partner has even sent out e-mail messages announcing where she is preaching the following Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pink, the author, says such openness addresses a common problem. ''Many free agents left organizations because they could not be fully who they were at work,'' he said. ''Smart organizations are now recognizing the advantages of allowing people to bring their full selves to work.''</p>
        <p>People like Ms. Williams and Mr. Silvera generally pursue double careers for personal satisfaction, not glory, but they sometimes gain prestige in the process. ''It makes me memorable to the clients and works to my advantage in business development,'' Ms. Williams said. And Mr. Silvera says the teacher-model combination has a twist: it gives him cachet even among the glitterati.</p>
        <p>''If you want to see a celebrity on his best behavior, tell him there is a teacher in his midst,'' Mr. Silvera said.</p>
        <p>Day-to-day maneuvering for dual careerists requires some logistical dexterity. Mr. Silvera recalls racing out to the school parking lot where a client's limousine, parked amid the sea of suburban minivans, was waiting to take him to a shoot. He says a nap or massage (arranged by his agency) on such car trips is all he needs to look refreshed. And while many teachers are ready to collapse at the end of a school day, he says he has plenty of energy because he is ''filled up with love'' from his students.</p>
        <p>When it comes to time management, though, Ms. Williams sounds like any worker trying to fit it all in. She muses that perhaps one day she will be trivocational, keeping her two current jobs and adding another more traditional one. ''That's when I figure out whether I can fit a family and a relationship into the mix,'' she said.</p>
