        <p>I had my heart set on a Swampscott dory. Of course, I hadn't actually been in one, but I had seen photographs. And it had such a salty New England name, with a sturdy work-boat heritage. I had a clear image of myself on the Hudson River, face lined by long years of wind and sun, hands and muscles hardened by work, pulling on the oars and cleaving the chop on a windy day, pulling in nets full of shad.</p>
        <p>O.K., so that was somebody else's life. Nonetheless, the boat had a great name, a history, nice lines. It seemed to be big enough to go fishing in and, with its traditional wooden construction, the sort of craft you could use to take friends out to admire the sunset and drink toasts to the dory's bright work.</p>
        <p>This fantasy is a departure from my usual approach to boats, which is to avoid bright work (the lovely varnished wood you see on elegant wooden yachts) at all costs. Bright work has to be regularly maintained (read varnished). I have stuck to the utilitarian and high-tech: Kevlar, recycled plastic and aluminum, all of it scratched and dented after the first few trips.</p>
        <p>But my aluminum boat, which I used on the Hudson, had an outboard motor that I never mastered. After a few seasons of frustration and a conviction that all motors were out to get me, I sold boat, motor and trailer, having decided to stick to watercraft like canoes and kayaks, which require no fuel and would have no moving parts, other than me.</p>
        <p>But I live near the Hudson, and you can't take friends striper fishing in a kayak. So I started to look into traditional rowing boats: the dories that fishermen have used for centuries or the surf boats that brawny life-savers used to launch from the beach. Soon my head was full of wonderful names and images. There was the Piscataquah wherry, long and lean; the Grand Banks dory, seaworthy and historical; the Butthead skiff, not related to Beavis.</p>
        <p>If you become afflicted with the romance of traditional small craft, sooner or later you are bound to wash up at Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Conn. Not only does it have yachts and whaling ships, a library and exhibits, but it also has a livery, the Boathouse, with 20 small boats that visitors can rent for a half-hour or more to row or sail on the Mystic River. On Fridays in the summer, the Boathouse offers a traditional boat-handling class in which you can try out all the boats in the collection, including, with oars and sail, a 17-foot Swampscott dory.</p>
        <p>I took the class a couple of weeks ago. A half-dozen of us had signed up, and there were more than a half-dozen volunteers to take us out in the bigger boats and provide rowing instruction. The first boat I rowed was called ''a good little skiff.'' And it was, although since I had a volunteer as a passenger, it required more effort than I expected.</p>
        <p>Next, I moved on to the Chaisson dory tender, an entirely different experience. Skiffs are flat-bottom boats, which tend to be fairly stable at first, but not always as swift as something like the dory tender, a round-bottom boat that was much easier to move and turn.</p>
        <p>''A rounded hull is more sea-kindly,'' I was told a few days later by Peter Vermilya, associate curator for the museum's watercraft collection. Round-bottom boats are also more difficult and more expensive to build, he explained, which is one reason that flat-bottom skiffs and dories were popular as work boats.</p>
        <p>With the right sort of boat and a little practice, rowing makes paddling seem an awkward, make-do sort of propulsion and an outboard motor an insult to elegance. The Chaisson dory tender felt as if it were fluid itself. I have always been interested in what is under the surface of the water, fishing or diving, which is how I ended up with practical but uninspired craft. With a beautiful, well-made boat, it is the surface that draws all the attention: the current, the chop, the shape of the hull, the gurgle as wood and water meet and pass each other with each stroke. And all of that is obscured by a powerful motor.</p>
        <p>The rowing smorgasbord continued. I tried a Peapod, a stable, satisfying lobsterman's boat, now designed for pleasure. It felt both smooth and secure. On the other hand, the Butthead skiff, a punt with two blunt ends, was the sort of craft I would imagine being in the watery version of bumper cars. It spun in circles at the touch of an oar. (''A good rocker bottom and short,'' said Mr. Vermilya, meaning the bottom of the boat curved like the base of a rocking chair.)</p>
        <p>I tried almost all of them, the Marblehead dory and the Rangely lake boat, the Chamberlain dory skiff and the Herreshoff/Gardner pulling boat, known as the Green Machine. I wouldn't have thought it possible to go too fast while rowing, but in the Green Machine, aided by an enthusiastic volunteer, we did, narrowly avoiding a collision. I tried to pull in sync with my partner while watching over my shoulder, learning to feather the oars and wondering if I would develop blisters on my hands.</p>
        <p>Each boat in the collection was designed for a reason. For instance, the Whitehall tender is an example of sleek boats used in various forms in the harbors of New York and Boston by ship chandlers and others who needed to row from dock to ship with speed. It was a pleasure to row. In a straight line, it almost seemed to move itself.</p>
        <p>But the river was crowded where we rowed, with other seaport boats and pleasure boaters coming down the river and out into Long Island Sound. At times I was looking (back over my shoulder, of course) for other rowers and sailors and the Boathouse's motor launch and large catboat, the Breck Marshall. Another vessel to watch out for is the surprisingly silent steamship Sabino. The whole experience was a bit like learning to drive in Times Square. And when I tried to turn the Whitehall in time to avoid bumping into one of the Boathouse's small sailboats, my effort was too little too late. As hard as I tried, the Whitehall, literally true to form, stayed on course.</p>
        <p>''What you ran into,'' Mr. Vermilya said, speaking metaphorically, ''was a long straight keel.'' Lesson: don't row a boat that sticks to its course unless you know where you're going.</p>
        <p>The Swampscott dory was the last boat I tried. By the time I got to it, the rest of the class was moving on to sailing. By this time, my arms were tiring, my hands had hot spots, and my second coat of sunscreen was wearing thin. (Sailors, like boats, need protective coating.) I had begun to wonder why I had ever questioned the value of outboard motors. Surely the men who had labored on these boats would have approved of mechanical aid.</p>
        <p>The volunteer who earlier advised me on my rowing (I was far too impatient, he said) told me that if I rowed until I was tired, then I'd start to pick up the proper leisurely rhythm. It was advice that was impossible not to follow, and the dory did move if I kept a slower pace. But as the Sabino hove into view, and the catboat sailors turned behind me, I had to lay into the oars (I believe that's the right phrase), and the full character of the Swampscott dory came home to me. It was salty. It was seaworthy. It was heavy.</p>
        <p>When I spoke to Mr. Vermilya later, I asked what he would choose if he were looking for a good rowing boat for, say, the Hudson River, one that could take a few passengers and serve for pleasure or fishing. We talked about the Peapod and the Piscataqua wherry, a boat I had seen in photographs. ''That boat sings to me,'' Mr. Vermilya said, although he pointed out that it would not handle rough water as well as the Swampscott dory, a boat he thought would be suited to the river.</p>
        <p>The dory, like many other rowing boats, can be outfitted with a sail. And it occurred to me as we talked that I might reconsider my attachment to rowing. No reason to use the oars, I suppose, if the wind is up. And even though sailboats have always seemed to me to have altogether too many ropes and pulleys and stays and sheets and halyards for comfortable fishing, I'm sure that they were used for just that purpose in the days before motors.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Vermilya added a thought that gave me pause. He said that such a boat ''would be very exciting on the river under sail.''</p>
        <p>Exciting? That wasn't in the plan. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that I ought to keep thinking about it. After all, a new boat is not the sort of thing you want to jump into.</p>
        <p>Small-Craft Advisories</p>
        <p>The Boathouse at Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Conn., offers an all-day class in traditional boat-handling on Fridays. The cost is $50 for members and $60 for nonmembers. Visitors may also rent rowing boats and sailboats on other days.</p>
