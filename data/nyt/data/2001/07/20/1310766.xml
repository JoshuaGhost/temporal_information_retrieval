        <p>Editorial says Pres Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never been tolerant of political dissent or unpopular lifestyles, but recently his rule seems to be growing more authoritarian and arbitrary; cites recent arrest of 52 men for alleged homosexual activities, and sentencing of Egypt's leading human rights advocate, Saad Eddin Ibraham, to seven years in prison for promoting democracy and religious tolerance; says repressive trend is particularly disturbing in country that is one of America's biggest aid recipients</p>

        <p>Tolerance for political dissent or unpopular lifestyles has never been a feature of Hosni Mubarak's 20-year tenure as Egypt's president. But recently Mr. Mubarak's rule seems to be growing more authoritarian and arbitrary. This week, 52 defendants were hauled before a special state security court for alleged homosexual activities. If convicted, they face sentences of three to five years with no right of appeal unless Mr. Mubarak personally intervenes. In May a similar court sentenced Saad Eddin Ibrahim, Egypt's leading human rights advocate, to seven years in prison for his efforts to promote democracy and religious tolerance.</p>
        <p>This repressive trend is particularly disturbing in a country that is one of America's biggest aid recipients. It is also potentially dangerous at a time when the entire Mideast has become more volatile following the breakdown of peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians. Instead of staging show trials, Mr. Mubarak should be doing more to address his people's real concerns like poverty and substandard social services.</p>

        <p>Tolerance for political dissent or unpopular lifestyles has never been a feature of Hosni Mubarak's 20-year tenure as Egypt's president.

        <p>This repressive trend is particularly disturbing in a country that is one of America's biggest aid recipients. It is also potentially dangerous at a time when the entire Mideast has become more volatile following the breakdown of peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians. Instead of staging show trials, Mr. Mubarak should be doing more to address his people's real concerns like poverty and substandard social services.</p>
        <p>Homosexuality is not a crime in Egypt, and should not be in any society. But homosexuality is strongly condemned by Islamic law. Prosecuting these men for contempt for religion, promoting deviant ideas and obscene behavior may be part of Mr. Mubarak's efforts to court Islamic conservatives, thereby reducing the appeal of fundamentalist guerrilla groups. The trial also seems to be intended to suppress gay-oriented Internet chat rooms. In Egypt as in other unfree societies, the police worry about people using the Internet to sidestep their efforts to control public speech and behavior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ibrahim, a 62-year-old scholar who holds American as well as Egyptian citizenship, became a target because his highly respected research organization, the Ibn Khaldun Center, received outside funding from the European Union and thus had the independence to challenge the government on sensitive issues like persecution of Coptic Christians and electoral fraud. His trial was unfairly conducted and politically motivated, an unpromising precedent for this latest case. His prosecution was seen as a deliberate move to intimidate less prominent government critics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mubarak's dictatorship is milder than that of most other Arab countries, and his foreign policy is generally more moderate. Under his rule, Egypt has been more open to economic reforms and positive outside influences than most of its neighbors. That is a distinction he should want to emphasize. Instead, his recent prosecutions threaten to blur it.</p>
