        <p>After 10 years as editor of The Financial Times, Richard Lambert announced today that he would step down in September.</p>
        <p>He will be succeeded by Andrew Gowers, 43, the head of The Financial Times Deutschland, the paper's German-language edition, which he established in 1999 as the founding editor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lambert, 56, made the announcement to his staff after clambering atop a desk in the newsroom, clutching a tumbler of water and telling them he had not made any firm long-term plans, journalists who were present said.</p>
        <p>Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, which owns The Financial Times, said Mr. Lambert had played a ''pivotal role in transforming the F.T. from a U.K. newspaper with an internationalist streak into the world's leading international business newspaper.'' During his tenure, a United States edition was started.</p>
        <p>Pearson said Mr. Lambert, who has worked for the newspaper since 1966, would remain for several months after handing over his duties to to Mr. Gowers, a former Reuters journalist who joined The Financial Times in 1983.</p>
        <p>Pearson said Mr. Lambert would complete several writing projects and ''develop ideas for the F.T.'s future international and online expansion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gowers filled in as editor in 1997 when Mr. Lambert moved to New York temporarily to set up the newspaper's United States edition. The paper, printed on distinctive salmon-colored newsprint, sought to challenge leading American dailies like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal on their home turf while the Journal's overseas editions battled The Financial Times head on in Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lambert was editor, Pearson said, the newspaper's daily circulation rose from 287,000 -- two-thirds of it in Britain -- to more than 486,000, with two-thirds outside Britain.</p>
        <p>At The Financial Times, Mr. Gowers covered agriculture, commodities and the Middle East. He was the features editor, the foreign editor and a deputy editor before he moved to Germany in 1999. His position as editor of The Financial Times Deutschland will be taken over by the newspaper's deputy editors, Wolfgang Munchau and Christoph Keese, Pearson said.</p>
