        <p>''Inbred Rednecks'' is a lumbering slob of a movie, an American Neanderthal comedy about the adventures of a passel of rustic Southern simpletons and the King Kong of fighting cocks.</p>
        <p>That the stupidity and cartoonlike performances of ''Inbred Rednecks'' are deliberate and consistent attests to the creative control of Joshua P. Warren, who wrote, directed, produced and scored the film besides playing the role of Clovis, one of the good ol' morons surrounding Billy Bob (Brent Ponder), the Gregor Mendel of chickenhood.</p>
        <p>Deliberate, too, is the film's penchant for protracted scenes that seem to hope for a spark of divine humor if they meander long enough, and the lowbrow source material for its comedy. Aside from considerations involving the breeding of Billy Bob's big bird, the film seeks fodder for its humor mill in adolescent double-entendres, cow dung, vomit, potty joking, presidential reproductive glands, midget bashing, a corrupt sheriff, antigay and misogynistic comments and mutilated and deranged war veterans. The problem isn't really with poor taste; it's with the failure to have the good taste to brew intoxicating comedy from  vulgar ingredients.</p>
        <p>Having infused a hen with human genes to produce a combative bird of proportions unseen between ''Sesame Street'' and the San Diego ballpark, Billy Bob hopes to buy the farm of his dreams with the fortune he expects to amass when his rooster slashes a champion's trail through the high stakes, big money, illegal cockfighting circuit.</p>
        <p>Billy Bob's nemesis is the nasty, swaggering Monty (Steve Lewis), who is outraged when his formidable rooster Demon commits suicide rather than square off against Billy Bob's bird in its first match. So Monty plots to kidnap Billy Bob's champion, and when he does, Billy Bob and his pals, who are so parochial that they claim never to have seen a black person except on television, take to their pickup truck and pursue the evildoer and his henchmen to the big city.</p>
        <p>Coherent but crude, ''Inbred Rednecks, '' opening today at the Two Boots Den of Cin (44 Avenue A, at East Third Street, East Village), isn't worth the trip.</p>
