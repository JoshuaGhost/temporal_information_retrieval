        <p>OUR nose knows when you draw close to this small Great Plains city. Unless you have had the foresight to roll up the windows and set the air-conditioner to ''recirc,'' blocking the outside air, your olfactory senses are treated to the historically accurate aroma of a Wild West cowtown.</p>
        <p>Dodge City was one of the most famous of these towns, as anyone old enough to associate Matt Dillon with the 60's TV marshal, and not the 80's screen heartthrob, will recall. By 1884, some eight million cattle were herded here by cowpokes whose itchy trigger fingers helped to fill the Boot Hill Cemetery downtown. You can pay your respects by turning off Wyatt Earp Boulevard and making a left onto Gunsmoke Street.</p>
        <p>There is less lawlessness here today, but cattle -- tens of thousands of them -- are still fattened at the feedlots outside town. From there, the animals will visit the slaughterhouse, destined to become chateaubriand, Kansas City strips and all-beef patties on sesame-seed buns. If the wind is right, the sharp aroma of feedlot wastes literally takes your breath away.</p>
        <p>I am here not for the fresh air, but to help celebrate the 80th birthday of my aunt, Thelma Nelson. She, my father and their six siblings grew up on the family farm east of town, scrimping through the Depression and clinging to the soil that didn't blow away in the Dust Bowl. Still, the economics of modern agriculture managed to do what droughts, hailstorms and tornados did not: drive most of the family into other occupations in other places. As part of the Plains diaspora, the family scattered from Seattle to Jacksonville, from El Centro, Calif., on the Mexican border, to New York City.</p>
        <p>So it seems fitting that I'm riding into town in the 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche, a citified truck far removed from the battered, dusty farm pickups indispensable to my forebears. A four-door truck with seats for five or six, plus a versatile cargo bed, it is a cross between pickup and sport utility vehicle, and it is intended not so much for heavy cargo and back-breaking labor as for hauling people and playthings.</p>
        <p>Is it all hat and no horse? Or has General Motors managed to adapt a big, utilitarian truck to today's suburban lifestyles of people like my cousins, nephews and nieces -- transporting the outfield to a Little League game, hauling mountain bikes to the wilderness, carrying plywood from Home Depot?</p>
        <p>Many other vehicles blur the lines between traditional segments, and there are four-door trucks like the Ford F-150 Super Crew and the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab, not to mention the Ford Explorer Sport Trac, an S.U.V. with a small cargo box. The problem, though, is that if you start with four doors and two rows of seats, adding a large and truly useful cargo bed makes a truck about as petite and agile as a Greyhound bus.</p>
        <p>Chevrolet has split the difference with the Avalanche, which can handle half a dozen passengers and a moderate amount of stuff, or a couple of passengers and a whole lot of stuff. The back of the passenger cabin consists of a unique bottom-hinged panel that can be opened to expand the the cargo bed to eight feet in length, from about five.</p>
        <p>Chevy calls this panel the midgate, and it is a clever idea that works. With the midgate upright, the back seat can accommodate three passengers. If you flip down the seat, you have a large storage area inside the cabin, plus the cargo bed. If you fold the midgate, too, the bed runs from the tailgate to the back of the front seats.</p>
        <p>You can leave the back window in place, with the cargo opening beneath it, or remove the window. You can take out the crossbar that separates the window from the midgate, turning the back of the cabin into a yawning cavern. Just make sure you securely tie down any cargo back there, or you could be pummeled by two-by-fours shifting forward in a panic stop -- or, worse yet, have your personal watercraft come crashing into the back of your seat.</p>
        <p>The rigid cargo cover provides more flexibility. Consisting of three removable panels that weigh less than 20 pounds each, it is integrated into the locking tailgate and transforms the bed into the world's largest car trunk. A soft tonneau cover is also available.</p>
        <p>In the often wasted space behind the wheel wells, Chevy added deep, lockable bins that are handy for tools or camping gear -- or for a tailgate party, given that you can fill them with ice and beverages. (Holes at the bottom provide drainage.) Two-sided lights shine into both the cargo bed and the storage boxes.</p>
        <p>Many trucks have steps molded into their bumpers, but they are often unusable, given that they are inaccessible when the tailgate is lowered. The Avalanche's more useful steps are cut into each end of the rear bumper. Hefty grab handles, which can also be used to tie down cargo, are bolted atop the rear fenders. The skin of those fenders is plastic resin that resists dents, and the bed is covered with a thick rubber mat to protect the steel floor. All storage areas are water-tight, Chevy says, thanks to a system of rain channels and drains.</p>
        <p>Having carved a new niche, G.M. took pains to make its truck look different. Indeed, the Avalanche is a little like the Plains creature that is said to be the offspring of a jack rabbit and an antelope. The jackalope appears on postcards -- designed, not too convincingly, with pre-Photoshop technology -- as a bunny with a rack of antlers. The look is distinctive though not graceful, which is one way to describe the Avalanche.</p>
        <p>It bears a passing resemblance to a Silverado pickup, though the hood is high and prominent and the wheel wells are flattened, as if fitted with 50's-style fender skirts. Slanted headlamps give the front end a pinched look (or, in G.M.'s view, ''powerful, sharply chiseled rock-face features.'') A triangular sail panel -- it provides structural reinforcement -- connects the cabin to the bed. Geometric shapes abound.</p>
        <p>The body seems not so much by Fisher as by Fisher-Price. A good third of the exterior wears plastic cladding that seems to belong, except for its somber gray color, on a kiddie car. Instead of shouting ''Tough!'' -- which must have been the idea -- the plastic whispers ''Cheesy.''</p>
        <p>One could look at the Avalanche and see, as G.M. hopes, a rugged, distinctive truck. Or one could see the graceless geometry of the Pontiac Aztek on a larger scale. In truth, during my travels around Memorial Day, giving Kansans their first glimpse of the Avalanche, it attracted a lot of mostly positive attention. People out here know their trucks, and the Avalanche never sat for long without drawing curious onlookers and small crowds.</p>
        <p>The new Chevy isn't likely to have farmers and ranchers lining up to trade in their Silverados and F-150's, but my traveling companion on this trip is a potential customer: Dave Shandy, a restaurant manager in suburban Kansas City who is married to my niece Ronnita. A Chevy enthusiast -- the couple have a Blazer, a 1500 Series pickup and a vintage Corvette -- Dave has closely followed the Avalanche's development since it appeared as a design study at the 2000 Detroit auto show.</p>
        <p>As we head west from Topeka on Interstate 70, Dave and I are both impressed with the stiff structure and supple ride. Because of the midgate, Chevy could not use the architecture of a conventional pickup, with a separate cabin and cargo box. So it turned to the Suburban S.U.V., which provided several additional benefits, including a one-piece cabin-cargo bed and rear coil springs.</p>
        <p>Not only does the Avalanche ride smoothly -- so much that you have to remind yourself that you're in a truck -- it is quiet. The silence is especially impressive if you consider all the hinges, latches and movable parts that make it possible to open up the back of the cabin.</p>
        <p>All of G.M.'s big trucks handle well for their size, and so does the Avalanche, at least on the open road. With a length of 18.5 feet, the Avalanche is two feet shorter than a Silverado extended-cab truck with a long box, but it is still a big brute, and its size works against it in town.</p>
        <p>The steering is light enough for parking maneuvers but weighty enough to inspire confidence at extralegal highway speeds. There is reasonable road feedback, good on-center feel and a reassuring sense of stability. The four-wheel disc brakes, however, feel barely adequate.</p>
        <p>Adequate, too, is the engine, a 5.3-liter V-8 used in various G.M. trucks. It is powerful, pulling the Avalanche from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a little over 8 seconds, and thirsty. (I averaged about 15 m.p.g.) But we noticed that on long upward grades through the Flint Hills, the four-speed automatic transmission had a tendency to kick down to a lower gear. Pulling a trailer, or hauling a load of lumber, would bog it down more.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche has a payload capacity of about 1,300 pounds and is rated to tow trailers of up to 8,300 pounds. Two- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, at prices for standard models of $30,965 to $38,711. A North Face Edition, developed in conjunction with the purveyor of outdoor gear, gets you special trim and waterproof duffel bags and daypacks for $3,500 extra. A heavy-duty 2500 Series, with leaf springs and a 340-horsepower, 8.1-liter V-8, will arrive in dealerships next month at base prices of $32,865 to $35,865.</p>
        <p>The same basic configuration will also be the basis for a Cadillac pickup, the Escalade EXT, which will go on sale this fall for over $50,000.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche is less lavish, but still well equipped. Standard are keyless locking, front-seat side air bags, power windows and locks, cruise control and CD player. The Z66 (rear drive) and Z71 (four-wheel drive) packages include 17-inch wheels, locking rear differential, special decals and even ''aggressive rubber floor mats.'' (With all the talk about road rage, do we really need attitude in our floor coverings?)</p>
        <p>Seating choices include cloth, leather and a cloth-leather combination, with either buckets or a three-person bench up front. There is plenty of room for burly ranch hands and 10-gallon hats.</p>
        <p>By the end of our return trip to Topeka, after nearly 10 generally pleasant hours in the Avalanche, Dave delivers his assessment. Having demonstrated the midgate several dozen times and taken a turn at the wheel, he is impressed by the Avalanche, but not yet ready to buy one. He'd like more seating, he says, for hauling around the entourages of his pre-adolescent sons. If gasoline prices remain stable, he'd like to get a Suburban in addition to his big pickup.</p>
        <p>And therein lies the dilemma of the Avalanche: It offers a lot of solutions to problems that many people don't know they have. Pickup people tend to remain loyal to what they already drive, and many S.U.V. owners don't really need a cargo box.</p>
        <p>Still, Chevy may well meet its goal of 100,000 sales in the first year of production. More cross-bred pickups and S.U.V.'s are inevitable, and some of these -- like the showy Lincoln Blackwood -- will be city slickers with more style than substance.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche isn't likely to go on many cattle drives, but at least it is capable of a hard day's work.</p>
