        <p>Back in the 1930's, when Dick Tracy phoned friends with his wristwatch telephone, high-tech dreams flooded the comics. But Dick Tracy couldn't receive an electronic message like ''Hey, Tracy: LOL! Signed, Pruneface.''</p>
        <p>Timex's new Internet Messenger watch enables the user to receive not only baffling instant messages on his wrist but also numerical and text pages, Internet e-mail, and Yahoo updates on stocks, weather, news and sports. The watch, which costs $119, harnesses technology from Motorola and SkyTel to receive and store up to 16 messages or 1,350 total characters. Messages of up to 100 characters scroll across the bottom of the face.</p>

Messages of up to 100 characters scroll across the bottom of the face.</p>
        <p>The only catch is that to use the features, the customer must open an account with SkyTel, which costs $9.99 for the first 500 messages and assigns the user an address for Timex e-mail. The watch, which has the styling of Timex's Ironman Triathalon line, includes a nighttime backlight, a stopwatch and five alarm settings. It can also set and maintain the correct time wherever you are.</p>
