        <p>WHEN the commercial building at 188 Main Street rose in Northport's bustling downtown in 1925, the old guard was giving way and Southern and Eastern European newcomers were beginning to make their presence felt.</p>
        <p>The two-story building's rounded cornice and minimally rendered Art Deco style gave it what was then a mildly futuristic look. But over the years, the building, occupied early on by a Nash car dealership and currently by a ground floor coffee bar and upstairs business offices, evolved into just another quaint part of Northport's cherished, picturesque downtown area.</p>
        <p>Now it is about to be demolished to make room for a Fire Department parking lot, and some residents in this North Shore village of 7,500 people are fighting to keep it standing.</p>
        <p>It is a clash of the kind that has occurred elsewhere on Long Island when municipal and commercial interests have been at odds with historical values and preservationist sentiment. Roxanne Browning, the village mayor, and the village's four trustees say the building must come down to provide more parking for volunteer firefighters next to a village firehouse, which will soon be expanded. Fire commissioners said the firehouse, built in 1954, is so cramped that volunteers, fire trucks and equipment can barely fit inside.</p>
        <p>Mayor Browning said there was nothing more to discuss, because a $4.9 million bond, approved by voters in January by a wide margin, included money for the firehouse expansion, the parking spaces, acquisition of the 188 Main Street property and the building of a new fire substation at another location.</p>
        <p>''The issue of saving the 188 Main Street building did not come up until after the referendum was approved by the voters, and therefore it is a nonissue,'' Ms. Browning said last week. ''The time for public debate is over, and the few people who are determined to change the village board's direction are wasting their time and energy.''</p>
        <p>But proponents of saving the building, organized as the Save Main Street Committee, said the village and the Fire Department never made clear that 188 Main Street, which the group regards as historic, would be razed to create 12 to 15 parking spaces in a new lot of about 32 spaces that would bring total parking in firehouse vicinity to around 78 spaces.</p>
        <p>They said that in trying to save the building they represented not a few but the many who viewed the demolition as a travesty that could be prevented but for the intransigence of the mayor and trustees.</p>
        <p>''We are a little dumbfounded,'' said Michael Newton, a group member and past president of the Northport Historical Society and Museum. ''Our elected officials don't seem to see that this building is an important part of our streetscape. They need to compromise and do what's best for the village.''</p>
        <p>A compromise, Mr. Newton said, would involve knocking down only a one-story annex to 188 Main Street between the firehouse and the two-story building. This would provide parking spaces and access to more parking in the rear of the building, he said, while allowing the building to remain and shielding the parking lot from Main Street.</p>
        <p>The village is trying to acquire the building, the annex and the property through eminent domain for $950,000 from a private owner, according to court papers.</p>
        <p>Henry Tobin, another group member, said that the building occupied only about 15 percent of the property. He said that by amending its eminent domain motion in State Supreme Court in Central Islip, the village could forgo taking title to the building at a saving of $200,000 to $300,000. That money, he said, could then be put toward the expansion and other firehouse improvements.</p>
        <p>''All of us support expanding the firehouse to the fullest extent,'' Mr. Tobin said. ''Our volunteers need the new facilities and equipment. We want to make sure they get all of that as soon as possible.'' But, Mr. Tobin said, all this could be done without demolishing 188 Main Street.</p>
        <p>Others said it was time to draw a line in Northport. ''We have not done enough to protect the historic treasures of our village,'' said Nancy Sakaduski, a group member and a trustee of the historical society.</p>
        <p>''We have stood by while our history has been chipped away, bit by bit, in the name of progress,'' Ms. Sakaduski said. ''While 188 Main Street is by no means our most beautiful or our most important building, its loss represents yet another irreplaceable part of our history that has been given up without a fight.''</p>
        <p>The seven members of the village's Architectural and Historic Review Board seemed to agree. ''This building's design is a prime example of the early-20th-century commercial storefront vernacular that is the defining character of Northport's lower Main Street,'' they said in a statement. To replace it with ''another parking lot'' would further erode Main Street's pedestrian scale, they said.</p>
        <p>The loss of 12 to 15 parking spaces, they said, ''seems a small price to pay'' for saving the building.</p>
        <p>''The board of trustees has the power to change this,'' said Kay Hutchins Sato, another Save Main Street member. ''We are not asking that they do something that is impossible.''</p>
        <p>But as of last week the fight to save the building was not going well, with village trustees dismissing the preservation drive as untimely and fire commissioners crying foul.</p>
        <p>''In order to grow, a village has to make some changes,'' said Ms. Browning, who cut her teeth in village politics opposing a new car wash. ''You can't just say, 'You have to stop here.' Where would we be today?''</p>
        <p>Fire commissioners said they were perplexed. ''It was laid out for them,'' said Philip J. Weber, chairman of the board of fire commissioners for the 110-member volunteer department, rejecting charges that plans to raze 188 Main were not made explicit before the referendum. ''Now suddenly they say this is a historic building.''</p>
        <p>A fire commissioner, Robert Guinn, said allowing the two-story building to stand while taking down the annex would create an alleyway leading to parking spaces that would be perilous for volunteers rushing to the firehouse. ''It's a safety issue,'' he said. ''I think the safety issue outweighs the little to no value of the building.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Guinn said ''every minute detail'' of the plan was explained at a public hearing before the referendum. He said that many volunteers go directly to fire scenes in their own vehicles because of the cramped conditions at the firehouse and the lack of adequate parking. ''When the whistle blows, you need a place to park,'' he said. He said some of the spaces in the new lot might also be used for public parking.</p>
        <p>Members of Save Main Street said so many new spaces were not needed given the number of firefighters that actually come to the firehouse in an emergency. They said local sentiment for saving the building was growing as more residents became aware of the demolition plan.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Craft, a Northport gas station owner whose grandfather, Byron Craft, owned 188 Main Street in 1925 and operated the Nash dealership, said last week that he was belatedly rallying to the preservation cause.</p>
        <p>''All too often when this stuff comes up, the local community doesn't get actively involved,'' he said. ''I would hate to see this building taken down for a parking lot.''</p>
        <p>Charla Bolton, a preservation advocate for the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities in Cold Spring Harbor, said the urge to preserve seemed to be on the rise.</p>
        <p>''You see a higher degree of citizen interest in preservation and more understanding of its economic value to the community,'' Ms. Bolton said. ''I would say things are looking up. But there's a lot of work to be done.''</p>
