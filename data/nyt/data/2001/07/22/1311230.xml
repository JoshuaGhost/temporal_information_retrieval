        <p>SITTING behind a large oak desk in the expansive, sun-drenched office that once belonged to her husband, Helene Fortunoff looks every bit the woman in charge. The suite in Fortunoff's Uniondale headquarters building is dominated by a wall unit lined with photos of her husband, their six grown children (five of whom work with her) and several grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''I'm still learning, but at the same time, I'm bringing in my own business style,'' said Mrs. Fortunoff, 67, who assumed the presidency of the Long Island institution formally known as Fortunoff Fine Jewelry &amp; Silverware Inc. when her husband of 47 years, Alan, died of cancer last July.</p>

        <p>SITTING behind a large oak desk in the expansive, sun-drenched office that once belonged to her husband, Helene Fortunoff looks every bit the woman in charge. The suite in Fortunoff's Uniondale headquarters building is dominated by a wall unit lined with photos of her husband, their six grown children (five of whom work with her) and several grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''I'm still learning, but at the same time, I'm bringing in my own business style,'' said Mrs. Fortunoff, 67, who assumed the presidency of the Long Island institution formally known as Fortunoff Fine Jewelry &amp; Silverware Inc. when her husband of 47 years, Alan, died of cancer last July.</p>
        <p>It is no part-time job. In 2000, Crain's New York Business ranked Fortunoff the 79th-largest privately held company in the New York metropolitan area. Crain's reported that with five locations and 3,700 employees, the company's revenues were $445 million last year, an 8 percent increase from 1999's $408 million -- numbers Mrs. Fortunoff has confirmed.</p>
        <p>Besides getting involved in company finances, she now oversees housewares, in addition to jewelry, which was always her domain and ''first love.''</p>
        <p>She is much more involved in store management and regularly visits Fortunoff's five locations: the flagship store in Westbury and locations in Manhattan and Paramus, Wayne and Woodbridge, N.J. She had parts of the Manhattan store renovated to showcase antique and silver giftware, jewelry, children's jewelry, gifts and clocks. And she has expanded the company's bridal and gift registry.</p>
        <p>''I am very hands-on at the moment,'' Mrs. Fortunoff said. ''With time, that will probably recede. But if I don't want the formula to change, I have got to make sure everything is done correctly.''</p>
        <p>She is also committed to opening a Suffolk County location.</p>
        <p>''We are actively looking to expand in the tristate area,'' said Mrs. Fortunoff, who has lived in Old Westbury for 35 years. ''We are interested in Long Island and other areas and are constantly looking at new sites. Where and when things happen really depends on whatever opportunity presents itself first.''</p>
        <p>Though Mrs. Fortunoff would not confirm any specific location, Frank DeRubeis, the Smithtown Planning Board director, said that for several years the company had been eyeing property both in and across from the Smith Haven Mall, the Lake Grove location that is one of 200 malls owned by the Simon Property Group.</p>
        <p>Fortunoff had looked at the mall in the late 1990's, Mr. DeRubeis said, but Federated Department Stores blocked the move to prevent competition with its Macy's and Stern's stores there. But in February, Federated announced it was closing or rebranding all 24 Stern's stores in New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Both the Simon Group, which is a part-owner with Fortunoff of the Source in Westbury, where Fortunoff's is the anchor store, and Federated declined comment.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Fortunoff, who was previously secretary treasurer of the company, said she was undaunted by her role as president.</p>
        <p>''I was always very involved in the business,'' she said. ''Our family dinner conversations always included what was going on, how we were proceeding, etc. The business was always a family entity. And when my husband passed away, it seemed natural that I would take the helm.'</p>
        <p>Business, it seems, is in Mrs. Fortunoff's blood. Raised in Fair Lawn, N.J., she credits her father, who owned a wholesale plumbing, heating and air-conditioning business in Hackensack, with cultivating her entrepreneurial spirit. She was just 13 when she began working for him after school and during the summer.</p>
        <p>''When I was in high school, we were on a split-session schedule due to overcrowding,'' she said. ''So I went to school from 7:30 in the morning until noon. Then I took a bus to my father's business and worked there until the office closed. I did typing, filing, bookkeeping -- whatever was needed.''</p>
        <p>In 1950, she entered Syracuse University and, after two years, transferred the New York University School of Commerce (now known as the Stern Business School), where she recalled being ''one of only two or three women in the program.'' She earned a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1953. That same year she married Alan Fortunoff, whom she had met in a real estate course.</p>
        <p>She soon joined her husband in his family's business, which at the time was nothing more than a neighborhood housewares store in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Eleven months later, her first child was born. Two weeks after that, she returned to work.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted a family and a career, and no one ever told me I couldn't have both,'' she said. ''I generally allowed myself 11 days off for the birth of my children. I had a staff to manage things at home while I worked full-time at the store.</p>
        <p>''I made $50 a week and paid the baby nurse $60,'' she said. ''But I knew within a period of months I'd be making $100 a week. I tell women, if their child care isn't adequate, they're going to worry, and it will affect their job performance. It's better to get the help you need and maybe come up short the first year. In the long run, you definitely come out ahead.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not talking about replacing quality time with your kids,'' she said. ''I always made that my priority. I'm talking about help.''</p>
        <p>It was Mrs. Fortunoff who, in 1957, spearheaded Fortunoff's entry into an uncharted area: jewelry. ''My husband's interest was limited solely to silver gifts and flatware,'' she said, ''and it was becoming apparent that that wasn't going to be an important enough business for us. We wanted to offer more luxury products with higher value.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mrs. Fortunoff has not only built jewelry into a $120 million business, she has also won praise within the male-dominated industry. She was the first recipient of the National Jewelers Award for retailing excellence. She was the first woman invited to join the United States Carat Club, a diamond industry leadership group sponsored by DeBeers.</p>
        <p>''I was visiting jewelry vendors around the world 38 years ago,'' said Mrs. Fortunoff. ''Not only was I one of very few retailers traveling the world, but I was probably the only woman buyer. And people were very aware of that.''</p>
        <p>Her zeal for hard work appears to run in the family. David, her 31-year-old son, serves as president of fortunoff.com, the company's Internet shopping site. Other children in the business are Louis, vice president in charge of human resources and merchandise manager of housewares and watches; Ruth and Esther, merchandise managers of jewelry; and Andrea, a Pratt-trained architect who oversees new construction and store renovations.</p>
        <p>Another daughter, Rhonda, is a potter in Oregon. Her work is in great demand, Mrs. Fortunoff said, but she won't ship it to the family store: ''She's too concerned it will break.''</p>
        <p>She admitted that her role as head of the family business initially prompted some second-guessing.</p>
        <p>''You can't sit in your husband's office 10 hours an day and not wonder, 'What would he do?' But lately I've been less and less able to turn that way. Times have changed. The economy has changed. And I've had to make some even tougher decisions than he did. But I love doing it. I wasn't afraid when I was 13, and I'm not afraid now.''</p>
