        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Selena Roberts's article, ''Off-Field Hurdles Stymie Indian Athletes'' (June 17), infers that because Indian athletes stay on or return to reservations and don't make tons of money and get huge endorsement contracts, they are not role models in their communities for kids ''whose self esteem can become threadbare.'' The article highlights the poor conditions on reservations, intracommunity jealousy and fear of white culture that inhibit athletes from ''making it'' in college and professional sports. But the tragedies that result, like the eventual deaths of members of the 70's Alchesay football team, are not because athletes couldn't break into American sports, and not actually because they never got off the reservation.</p>

        <p>Reservations are by definition lacking. They represent leftover pieces of land parceled to Native Americans after war, genocide, broken treaties and deception. The resulting poverty and poverty-related diseases like alcoholism are long-standing problems never fairly, adequately or responsibly confronted by white society. Still, tribal communities fight for a culture they believe in as strongly, more so than any other ethnic, religious or cultural community in American society. If Indian athletes want to leave reservations for college or the pros, they should have a fair shot at it. If they don't want to leave, their decision should not be construed as a failing by the Indian kids themselves or the white world that continually makes the rules on values for all.</p>
