        <p>TONY BLACK looks out from the jocks' room onto the shaded paddock area at Delaware Park Racetrack.

        <p>TONY BLACK looks out from the jocks' room onto the shaded paddock area at Delaware Park Racetrack. It's a 90-degree day, so the air-conditioning is blasting inside the spare quarters decorated in Early Rumpus Room -- a beat-up pool table, a few worn couches, strewn cups on battered tables.</p>
        <p>''This isn't fancy,'' Mr. Black apologized, ''but I guess it's home for us.''</p>
        <p>Jocks' rooms -- the places where jockeys wait around between their mounts -- are where Mr. Black has called home for 31 years now. He rode his first winner at  Liberty Bell Race Track in Philadelphia in 1970. It was a 52-to-1 long shot named Stand By Me. About 28,000 races and more than 4,300 trips to the winner's circle later, he's still riding them today.</p>
        <p>Approaching his 50th birthday, Mr. Black travels the 45 miles from his home in Westmont, in Camden County, every day and is  the top-winning rider for the spring-summer meet here at Delaware Park.</p>
        <p>''There are guys out there racing in their late 40's, but not riding six, seven horses a day like Tony,'' said Samuel Boulmetis Sr., the top steward at Monmouth Park, who also happens to be Mr. Black's uncle and the man who got him into racing in the first place. ''He's a truly amazing rider.''</p>
        <p>Michael Jordan is being called crazy for thinking about a basketball comeback at age 38. Most football players are well out of the game by their middle 30's. Even in contactless baseball, over 40 is usually limited to pitchers and designated hitters.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Black is not only at it daily, but beating competitors less than half his age.  And he is doing it with demons of many types hounding him. He has had broken bones in his arms, legs, wrists, ribs and ankles. He has had a broken collarbone, and he has smashed his nose several times. Then there are the thousands of stitches and  bad eyesight.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Black's biggest setback came from early success. Through the 1980's, he fought against addiction to drugs and alcohol. The money from winning races was good, and nights were open for partying.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the racing got in the way of the parties,'' said Mr. Black, wincing with the irony. He went through hundreds of thousands of dollars and two marriages. He had come in fourth in the 1981 Kentucky Derby on Classic Go-Go and piloted My Juliet to the 1976 sprint championship at Aqueduct against the winner of the Derby and the Belmont Stakes, Bold Forbes. But by the late 1980's, he was scrounging mounts from sympathetic trainers.</p>
        <p>Through the intercession of family and his third wife, Kiely, he went through rehab and has been sober for nearly 10 years. After all, the family is how Mr. Black got into this game in the first place.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, Samuel Boulmetis, then a hall of fame jockey at the peak of his career, bought a horse farm in rural Burlington County. The Black family lived there for a time and Mr. Black and his brother, Nick, started riding at an early age. The Blacks moved to Westmont, two-miles from Garden State Park, where Tony spent early mornings in his teens as a hot walker, exercising horses and generally helping out at what was then a premier racetrack.</p>
        <p>''The people at Haddon Township High School were really flexible with me,'' he said. ''I would get out there 5, 6 in the morning and be allowed to come to school at 10. Then I would wrestle in the afternoons. It was a long day for a kid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black was a champion wrestler in the 98-pound weight class, which could have gotten him a college scholarship, but he was progressing at the track. While his classmates were at the graduation ceremony, he was on that first winner, Stand By Me.</p>
        <p>And while some of his classmates may now be contemplating early retirement, Mr. Black is still saddling up, enthusiastic about every mount.</p>
        <p>''Look, I know this can't go on forever,'' he said. ''I'd like to stay on until 5,000 wins, which would take about three or four more years at this pace. That would be nice. But what keeps me going is that I love winning.  When I retire, that is what is going to be the hardest thing to replace.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black's forte is squeezing the reserve of a horse. His style is to get to the front early and find a way to stay there. If other jocks have a complaint about Mr. Black on the track, it is that he weaves in and out to get to the front, sometimes cutting them off.</p>
        <p>''He's frustrating,'' said one jock who asked that his name not be used. ''But he's smart and it's always challenging to go against him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Black said he was always hustling new mounts and studying The Racing Form.</p>
        <p>''I spend a lot of time in the barns, looking at horses, watching them practice, seeing how they run, talking to the trainers,'' he said. ''You not only have to know your horse, but the other ones in the race, and that is where I think my experience really helps.</p>
        <p>''The Tony Black package, if you will, is that I can tell you, the trainer or owner, exactly what you should do with your horse,'' he went on. ''Some jocks don't want to do that, to rock the boat. I try to give an honest evaluation. But, of course, what I like to do best is ride. And win.''</p>
        <p>And win he has. On July 30 and 31, he tied a United States record by winning nine consecutive races at Philadelphia Park and Atlantic City. Despite his midcareer troubles, he is still 13th among active riders in wins and 28th all time. His mounts have won nearly $40 million for their owners. With Delaware Park's previous top jock, Mike McCarthy, out with an injury, Mr. Black is likely to be the wins leader there when the meet ends in October. After that, he will come back to Philadelphia Park, where he is the all-time leading winner.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia Park is not Churchill Downs, but it is where Mr. Black was welcome even in his worst drug days. It is where he met Kiely, who is a floor manager, assisting visitors to the track. His brother, Nick, is a racing official based there.</p>
        <p>''It's a short drive from home, and home is where it is important these days,'' Tony Black said. He lives only a few doors down from his mother, Marge (his father, Pete, died in April), and last week he finally got to attend a Haddon Township High School graduation, this one for his son Mike a wrestling champ himself who is off to Indiana University in the fall. His older son, Tony, will be a junior at Quinnipiac College.</p>
        <p>''I like to race in the daytime now,'' the jockey said. ''Oh, sometimes a trainer will want me to go to the Meadowlands at night, so I do, but that's only on occasion. Mom still cooks for us a lot. She knows nutrition, and staying in shape is what I have to do at this age.''</p>
        <p>The bone breaks still come. In February 2000, he broke his foot in a race and was out for several months. He said he wasn't too worried because he was a bit worn out anyway. He got to watch his son wrestle and used the time to get an operation on his nose to straighten it. He came back in the summer, but then broke the foot again.</p>
        <p>''That's when I went stir-crazy,'' he said.  ''I had already rested. It's tough for a competitor to sit on the sidelines, no matter what age.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, 15 years after his first shot at the Kentucky Derby, Mr. Black went back there, on In Contention, which was out of contention, coming in 16th. The dream of having a Derby winner, though, hasn't died.</p>
        <p>''You never say never,'' he said. ''All I need is one 2-year-old from around here and a trainer who likes Tony Black. A few good races as a 2-year-old and then, who knows?  One year, you remember, I had the fourth-best horse. It could happen again.</p>
        <p>''When you are a competitor, you have to think that way,'' he continued. ''When I get down off my last horse, that is the only time the dream will die. At age 50 or 20, that's the way you have to think.''</p>
