        <p>A major New York health insurer has agreed to reimburse customers $35,000 after failing to pay for emergency room services that should have been covered by their plans, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, announced yesterday. Because of a technical error, Group Health Inc. classified 195 emergency room claims as nonemergency treatment, said Ilene Margolin, a company spokeswoman. Customers had to pay those charges themselves, Mr. Spitzer's office said. The company, which processes more than 17 million claims a year for 2.6 million participants, will also pay $1,000 in penalties and $4,000 in costs, Mr. Spitzer said.</p>
