        <p>The Gillette Company has expanded its relationship with the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, by naming BBDO New York to handle creative duties for its worldwide oral-care businesses, including the Oral B line of toothbrushes and dental floss along with the Braun line of oral-care appliances. Annual spending was estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The assignment had been handled for the last year by Gotham in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Gotham inherited the creative account from an Interpublic sibling, Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide.</p>

        <p>Eric Kraus, a spokesman for Gillette in Boston, confirmed a report of the shift, made without a review, in the online edition of Advertising Age.</p>
        <p>''We felt BBDO had the global creative resources we were looking for,'' he said. BBDO New York already handles creative duties for worldwide brands sold by Gillette that include Duracell batteries and Gillette shaving and personal-care products.</p>
