        <p>During the spasm of violence in Jamaica earlier this month, my wife and I spent a quiet afternoon on the veranda at the home of my 84-year old mother, in a part of Kingston less than three miles from the center of the conflict that, over four days, left more than 25 people dead. We felt about as safe as we would anywhere in New York or Boston.</p>
        <p>Jamaica is a 144-mile mountain range jutting out of the Caribbean. The capital city of Kingston and the homes of most of the country's 2.5 million inhabitants are on the southern coast. Nearly all the hotels worth visiting are located a huge mountain and a social world away, on the northern coast. Jamaica does have a higher level of crime and violence than most other nations, but the violence is largely confined to particular urban neighborhoods in the southern part of the island. And the recent clash between police and politically motivated gangsters was restricted to one small section of the western urban slums of Kingston.</p>
        <p>What is really going on here?</p>
        <p>Jamaica is a test case of all that's best and worst about democratic regimes in less developed countries. It shares with most of the other Caribbean islands of the British Commonwealth a deeply rooted commitment to personal freedom and democratic governance. Voter participation rates here put the United States to shame. What's more, unlike Japan and many other modern democracies, Jamaica has repeatedly passed the ultimate test of any thoroughly institutionalized democracy: it has had several changes of government since independence in 1962, the two dominant parties each having ruled and been thrown out of office by the voters about the same number of times. Supporting this democracy are a free and vigilant press, a sophisticated tradition of social and political discourse, and a vibrant civil society. The country also has a complex and highly developed popular culture and intellectual tradition. That's the good news.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that Jamaica's attempts at economic development have largely failed. Here, as in Puerto Rico and most other Caribbean islands, post-independence attempts at industrialization have fallen apart. Jamaica now has vast shantytowns; unemployment at depression levels; and high rates of economic inequality, crime and drug abuse. The government has met many conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund in return for much-needed loans: a stable annual inflation rate of 5.8 percent, falling interest rates, adequate international reserves and the return of positive growth. But at the same time, public debt is nearly 160 percent of the gross domestic product and interest consumes more than half of all government expenditure, leaving little to address the social problems.</p>
        <p>External migration and a thriving informal economy have been safety valves of the system. Between a quarter and a third of all Jamaicans live abroad, most in the United States. Secretary of State Colin Powell, a second-generation Jamaican-American, is the most visible symbol of Jamaicans' achievements in America. Even Jamaicans who have become American citizens tend to  maintain strong ties with the island, making Jamaica in effect a transnational society. And the money they send home ranks second only to tourism in contributing to the economy's net foreign earnings. This half explains the large villas sprouting all over the countryside in spite of years of negative economic growth.</p>
        <p>The other half of the explanation is in the darker side of the informal economy: the drug trade. Marijuana has traditionally been used in Jamaica, but more sinister, the island is increasingly used as a transshipment center by Colombian dealers feeding America's insatiable demand for narcotics. And as in America and other parts of the world, guns and turf wars follow the illicit drug trade. The dons and drug gangs of the slums are often more heavily armed than the security forces waging losing battles to control them. The police have increasingly resorted to illegal tactics that violate the rights not only of the criminal elements but of innocent residents trapped in the neighborhoods where the criminals operate.</p>
        <p>Jamaica's parliamentary democracy, on the British model, interacts badly with this turbulent socioeconomic mix. A politician's political survival depends entirely on his or her ability to win repeatedly at the local level. One sure method of ensuring repeated victory is to create what is called a garrison constituency: a pocket of housing erected with public funds, with carefully screened residents who will constitute the unbeatable core of the politician's voters.</p>
        <p>These began with Edward Seaga, now the leader of the Jamaica Labor Party, when he was in office during the 1960's and 80's. The leading politicians of the other main party soon followed his lead. There are now about 15 hard-core garrison constituencies, and political fights between them during elections have spilled over into broader, ongoing turf wars. The resulting gangs, initially formed for political purposes, now also serve the drug trade. During the 80's, many of these gangs migrated to America, where they became known as posses and soon forged a reputation for violence.</p>
        <p>These gangs have increasingly worked to generate unrest as a political tactic. This may have been a cause of the recent violence, which was as much a police riot as a counterattack by political thugs against police. The violence took place in garrison constituencies loyal to the opposition party, and many commentators here see it as an attempt by the opposition to pressure the government to call an early election (the next scheduled election is not until next year).</p>
        <p>Last week Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, leader of the People's National Party, ordered a commission of inquiry to determine the causes of the recent violence and propose steps to fight criminality. Mr. Seaga had called for such a commission.</p>
        <p>Today Jamaica, like the few other genuine democracies in the third world, is attempting to do what history has so far found to be impossible: develop a successful capitalist economy after first embracing freedom, allowing a vigorous trade union movement and guaranteeing universal adult suffrage. Economic failure and mass poverty have in no way diminished the nation's passion for freedom.</p>
        <p>The United States should recognize its interest in supporting this small struggling nation right at its doorstep -- especially since a healthy, functioning democracy there would be better able to resist the drug trade that harms both countries.</p>
