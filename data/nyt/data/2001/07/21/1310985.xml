        <p>BRIDGEPORT, Conn., July 20 Â— A Connecticut stockbroker who is a longtime friend of Mayor Joseph P.

        <p>A Connecticut stockbroker who is a longtime friend of Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport pleaded guilty today to a federal conspiracy charge, telling a judge that he had agreed to pay kickbacks to another close friend of Mr. Ganim and to an unnamed elected city official in exchange for winning contracts related to the police and fire department pension funds.</p>
        <p>The stockbroker, Frank W. Sullivan, is the fifth person to plead guilty as a result of a continuing federal investigation into widespread municipal corruption in Bridgeport. Federal law enforcement officials have declined to name the official who is at the center of their investigation, but Mayor Ganim himself has acknowledged that people are ''pointing the finger'' at him.</p>
        <p>In federal district court here today, Mr. Sullivan, 39, of Fairfield, said that he had agreed to pay kickbacks amounting to half of any commissions and fees he earned from the pension fund accounts. Mr. Sullivan said he understood that the kickbacks were to be split by Paul J. Pinto, a political fund-raiser and close friend of Mr. Ganim, and an elected official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinto and Mr. Ganim's former campaign manager, Leonard J. Grimaldi, pleaded guilty last month to federal racketeering and bribery charges, admitting that since 1995 they had given hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of cash, furniture, clothing, jewelry and meals to a top city elected official.</p>
        <p>In pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Mr. Sullivan said: ''I entered into an agreement to pay a percentage of the commission and fees that I received from doing business with the City of Bridgeport, in order to do business with the City of Bridgeport.''</p>
        <p>According to prosecutors, Mr. Sullivan, who most recently worked for Salomon Smith Barney, had agreed to share about $500,000 that he expected to get by managing police and fire pension funds worth about $350 million. Mr. Sullivan helped Salomon Smith Barney win the contract to manage the funds.</p>
        <p>But an assistant United States attorney, Ronald S. Apter, told Judge Alan H. Nevas today that Mr. Pinto and the elected official learned of the federal investigation and that the bribes they had demanded were never paid. ''Mr. Pinto did not request and the defendant did not pay the kickbacks,'' Mr. Apter said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Salomon Smith Barney, Susan Thomson, said the firm was unaware of any agreements between Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Pinto and a city official. ''We are confident in the integrity of the process by which we secured the business and the quality of the services we have since provided to the city,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan, who had been on leave from the company while the federal investigation proceeded, was fired in June. But Bridgeport's contract with Salomon Smith Barney remains in place and the company continues to manage the pension funds for a fee of $325,000 to $400,000 a year.</p>
        <p>While federal officials have declined to name the elected official who is the central target of their investigation, the pressure on Mr. Ganim continues to build.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, The Connecticut Post, Bridgeport's daily newspaper, reported that it had obtained public documents linking Mr. Ganim to Brian Bannon, a local asbestos contractor who pleaded guilty last week to a federal fraud charge. Mr. Bannon said he had stolen nearly $80,000 from Bridgeport by inflating his fees and had paid kickbacks to Mr. Pinto in exchange for rigged city contracts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bannon also admitted that he had provided free asbestos removal services to an unnamed city official. Under the state's freedom of information law, The Post obtained records showing that Mr. Bannon's company had filed for a permit to remove asbestos from a Bridgeport home owned by Mr. Ganim's brother. Mr. Ganim and his wife, Jennifer, lived in the house in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ganim has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing even as he has conceded that the investigation seems to be focused on him. His chief of staff, Chris Duby, did not return a telephone call seeking comment on Mr. Sullivan's guilty plea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan first began doing work for Bridgeport's police and firefighter pension fund in March 1996, according to federal prosecutors, when he was working as a stockbroker with Paine Webber, and it was the unnamed ''elected official'' who urged the city's police and fire commissioners to hire him.</p>
        <p>He is expected to receive a prison term of 12 to 18 months when he is sentenced in October.</p>
