        <p>BENEATH a sign that asks ''What have you done for you lately?'' the cosmetics section of the Wal-Mart store here is a hard-working shrine to eye shadow, face powder, nail polish, mascara and all the other products that help highlight, conceal, enhance and perfume.</p>
        <p>There are nationally advertised brands like Cover Girl and L'Oréal, each in its own alcove. There are popular lower-priced brands, like Jane. And then, at the end of one aisle, there is a newcomer: No Boundaries, a line packaged in silvery paper, decorated with brightly colored stickers and bearing whimsical names like Sheeny in a Bottle and Do Me a Flavor.</p>
        <p>These lipsticks, mascara gels, shimmer crayons and nail enamels, which began arriving in stores in March, are the latest budget-priced, store-brand offering from Wal-Mart, the Bentonville, Ark., retailer that is the world's largest, three times the size of its nearest competitors. All the No Boundaries cosmetics cost $2.74, except for the nail polish, at $1.74. The prices are the same in every Wal-Mart in the country, including the store in Middletown, 60 miles northwest of New York City, where they are lower than all other similar products in the section, including Cover Girl nail polish ($2.46) and lipstick ($4.84) and Estée Lauder's Jane lipstick ($3.24).</p>
        <p>And No Boundaries products are available only at Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>Whether the category is makeup or cat food, Wal-Mart Stores is increasingly focused on developing and promoting its in-house, or private-label, brands across the vast acreage of its 2,634 stores and supercenters. The effort is part of a new strategy to bolster profits and assert the company's strength, as well as to attract certain kinds of consumers -- especially those free-spending teenagers -- who might not otherwise flock to Wal-Mart. The agenda was set a couple of years ago under David D. Glass, the former chief executive, and appears to be gaining momentum under the new chief, H. Lee Scott Jr.</p>
        <p>It could be a smart strategy, one that the company is unusually well positioned to pull off. Many retailers, Wal-Mart included, worry about where their future customers will come from. If a teenager is not shopping in the store by, say, her 19th birthday, chances are that she never will, industry experts say.</p>
        <p>''It is a very, very significant acknowledgment of a major problem on the part of Wal-Mart that they are now going to do this,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant. ''It is extremely critical if they don't want to lose the future.''</p>
        <p>CREATING exclusive products, like cosmetics and apparel, that appeal to teenage shoppers is one reason to pursue a private-label strategy. But there are many others.</p>
        <p>Private-label products are highly profitable. They can capture share from national brands and push down prices on those brands.</p>
        <p>Still, putting too much emphasis on such merchandise can alter the character of a store -- and Wal-Mart, like all other retailers, must walk a fine line in terms of its customers' desires as well as its relationships with brand-name manufacturers. On the one hand, all manufacturers want to have their products sold by the biggest retailer in the country. On the other hand, they usually must answer to shareholders, and if they have to lower their prices to compete with a store brand, their profit margins will suffer.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart, which had $6.3 billion in profits last year, appears determined to have all its private-label products be the cheapest in the store. In areas as mundane but essential as laundry detergent, its prices are well below those of the national brands. Wal-Mart's private-label products include store brands, exclusive licenses and, more recently, other companies' brands that it has acquired. And its total sales of these products are rising.</p>
        <p>Though the company declined to make executives available for interviews or to provide details about the strategy, citing competitive concerns, it has been discussing its plans with analysts and retail consultants in recent weeks. Late last month, the company's chief financial officer, Thomas M. Schoewe, said private-label growth meant that Wal-Mart was listening ''to customers for a void.''</p>
        <p>One analyst, John R. McMillin of Prudential Securities, estimates that private-label products account for 5 percent to 8 percent of the groceries Wal-Mart sells in its supercenters -- discount stores combined with full-scale supermarkets. That number, while growing, is still lower than in the typical American grocery chain, where private labels account for 15 to 18 percent, Mr. McMillin added.</p>
        <p>Private-label sales, excluding groceries, in all mass merchandise stores rose nearly twice as much as revenue in the industry -- and, of course, Wal-Mart makes up most of the industry. Such sales reached $6.5 billion nationwide last year, up 12.2 percent, while the industry's overall revenue rose just 7.1 percent, to $62.3 billion, said Dane Twining, a spokesman for the Private Label Manufacturers Association in New York. Mr. Twining added that unit sales rose to 13.1 percent of total sales last year from 12.4 percent.</p>
        <p>These days, private-label products, often packaged and displayed much more attractively and prominently than the generic products of the past, can help distinguish a retailer that wants to build shopper loyalty. Anyone who develops an affinity for No Boundaries cosmetics must to go to Wal-Mart to get them.</p>
        <p>And private-label products are hugely profitable for their owners. There is no middleman and usually no advertising budget, and the manufacturers are often the same companies that make brand-name products anyway. Quality has improved in many cases, making comparisons based on price more likely.</p>
        <p>ALL retailers are feeling a pinch these days, as once-euphoric consumers trim their spending, period. While consumer spending has risen slightly in recent weeks, Americans are still nervous about the economy's prospects, as companies report weak earnings and lay off employees. Times like these make private-label brands even more appealing to retailers.</p>
        <p>When the retailer in question is Wal-Mart, a behemoth that racked up $191.3 billion in sales last year, double its 1997 total, by being both the largest discount store and the largest supermarket chain in America, a private-label push can have huge implications for dozens of industries.</p>
        <p>''Wal-Mart is being more aggressive on private label, especially in consumable areas and in health and beauty aids,'' said Emme P. Kozloff, a retail analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''They are also being more aggressive about how they present it. It's no longer the stepchild. It's being presented as a solid alternative.''</p>
        <p>Starting in the early 1980's, Wal-Mart introduced private-label products intermittently. But in the last two years it has gone into overdrive. Besides rolling out its cosmetics aimed at teenagers, Wal-Mart has bought the White Cloud toilet tissue brand from Procter &amp; Gamble and has introduced its own detergent under the Sam's Choice label. (The Sam is for Sam Walton, the company's founder, who died in 1992.)</p>
        <p>It also paid an undisclosed amount in licensing fees to put the Mary-Kate and Ashley label, named after television's Olsen twins, on a line of clothing for preteen and teenage girls that is ''blowing out of the stores,'' Ms. Kozloff said. The line joins an array of other Mary-Kate and Ashley offerings, whose sales to date are widely reported as approaching $1 billion.</p>
        <p>In the typical Wal-Mart store, private-label offerings abound: Great Value cereal, cookies and pasta, which share shelf space with Kellogg cereals and Nabisco cookies; Great Value potato chips and other snack food alternatives; soft drinks, including Sam's Choice cola and other flavors; cat food, sold under the Special Kitty label; and Ever Active batteries. Many of the food and household products are also sold in Sam's Clubs, Wal-Mart's warehouse stores.</p>
        <p>The Wal-Mart brand is unfailingly the cheapest one available. In the soft-drink aisle, for example, Sam's Choice cola costs 58 cents for a two-liter bottle, while Coke is $1.07 and Pepsi $1.08 for the same size. The name-brand and private-label products often appear on the same shelf, or very near one another. Sometimes, as in the case of Sam's Choice cola, the packaging resembles a national brand in both the label color and some of the graphics.</p>
        <p>THE company has said consumers sometimes need to be ''educated'' about private-label brands, but once the education takes place, there seems to be solid results. Sales of private-label food products were up last year, compared with 1999, shareholders were told last month at Wal-Mart's annual meeting in Fayetteville, Ark. When the price of a bag of Great Value cookies was slashed to 88 cents from $1 last year, unit sales jumped 54 percent, the company told investors. If a company like Wal-Mart does not mind sacrificing a little profit, all kinds of possibilities emerge.</p>
        <p>The company's stores and supercenters now carry 1,259 kinds of private-label products, up 12 percent from last year, Ms. Kozloff said, citing information provided at the shareholder meeting.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart says its private-label products are a response to consumer demand. ''The market has really dictated every move we have made in private-label brands,'' said a spokesman, Tom Williams. ''We create them to improve value to customers, which builds customer loyalty.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Some customers prefer name brands, some prefer private-label brands, and many customers purchase both.''</p>
        <p>Any move by Wal-Mart creates ripples far beyond the local supercenter, and the stepped-up emphasis on private labels is certain to affect the nation's consumer-products manufacturers. While most analysts and retail-industry experts contend that Wal-Mart will continue to emphasize low prices on national brands as a means of bringing shoppers in its doors, some say that over time, Wal-Mart could throw more and more weight behind its private-label products, creating a major shift in the way other companies make and market their soaps, soft drinks, cookies, crackers, potato chips, pet food and other products, and certainly affecting the prices charged for national brands.</p>
        <p>In at least one area, liquid laundry detergent, Wal-Mart's sales of its own brand already appear to be influencing sales of leading national brands. In others, analysts say, prices for national brands can be depressed by the presence of a Wal-Mart brand. Some company executives complain -- though not in public -- that they regularly lose money on the products they sell through Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>The giant retailer reveals to the outside world relatively little about activities in its stores. And it is about to reveal even less. In May, Wal-Mart announced that it would no longer make sales data from its cash registers and scanners available to companies that compile such data, saying that the practice helped its competitors more than it helped Wal-Mart. The change takes effect at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>But Wal-Mart's size alone nearly always means big  changes for any retail business it touches. ''I've been to Bentonville, Ark., and it's not the end of the world,'' one food industry executive joked recently. ''But when you get there, you see it.''</p>
        <p>After only 13 years in the supermarket business, Wal-Mart this year became the industry leader. ''Wal-Mart has gotten 11 percent of the U.S. food industry by selling brand names cheaply, not by pushing private label,'' said Mr. McMillin of Prudential Securities. But ''now that they are big, now that they have scale, they can do more,'' he added. ''It bothers me, because they are so big and they put a lid on prices.'' Thinner margins on food products sold at Wal-Mart could affect a company's earnings.</p>
        <p>And it is not just food makers that are facing the challenge. At an analysts' meeting last fall in Bentonville, one Wal-Mart executive cited eye drops as an example of an overpriced consumer product that the company might be able to correct with a brand of its own, Mr. McMillin recalled. ''They sense opportunities,'' he said, ''whether it's in dog food or in something else.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it is just a matter of timing. As the economy has cooled in the last six months, more shoppers appear to be turning to private-label products or the cheapest national brands. At the same time, manufacturers' costs have risen, with escalating fuel prices and increases in raw materials, and those costs are often reflected in higher consumer prices for brand-name products. Private-label competitors, meanwhile, remain at the lowest price.</p>
        <p>''We believe Wal-Mart will effectively use its private-label merchandise to fill any value gaps left by vendors who decide to pass on price increases,'' one analyst, Shari Schwartzman Eberts of J. P. Morgan Securities, wrote in a note to investors last month. In that note, Ms. Eberts described Wal-Mart executives as concerned about rivals' pricing, apparently the most competitive in years. ''Weaker consumer liquidity is also being displayed in the consumer's preference for opening price point'' -- the lowest-price national brand -- ''and private-label merchandise,'' she wrote. ''Sales for both are significantly outperforming store averages.''</p>
        <p>WHILE many consumers are skittish about parting with their hard-earned cash, one group -- teenagers -- is less so. But Wal-Mart historically has not been a teenager's primary destination for clothes, accessories and other essentials.</p>
        <p>''One of the problems the stores are having is that teens have been turned off by department stores,'' said Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a trade magazine for the cosmetics industry. ''And as they get older, they are not department store shoppers.''</p>
        <p>Private-label offerings seem to be one way to change that, and the Mary-Kate and Ashley clothing brand developed by Wal-Mart, as well as the No Boundaries cosmetics, are aimed squarely at preteen and teenage girls.</p>
        <p>As it woos teenagers, Wal-Mart has plenty of company. For years, Target has attracted style-conscious younger shoppers with various licensed designs. Recently, it introduced its Sonia Kashuk cosmetics line, named after a professional makeup artist, and even sprang for the line's own television advertisements. J. C. Penney has worked to create a teenage following for its Arizona jeans.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart was relatively late to join the private-label game, said George Strachan, a retail analyst at  Goldman, Sachs. Among the company's first products, introduced in 1982, was its Ol' Roy line of dog food.  Since then, there have been apparel lines (Kathie Lee, White Stag, Faded Glory), batteries, soft drinks, tools (Popular Mechanics), and a plethora of other products.</p>
        <p>The Kathie Lee apparel came under attack when it was revealed several years ago that child laborers in Bangladesh were working on at least some of the products, though sales today are solid. The dog food was an immediate hit.</p>
        <p>''They do these things, and some of them are home runs, and some are not,'' Mr. Strachan said. But for Wal-Mart, the real value of private-label merchandise may be its usefulness in driving down the prices for brand  products.</p>
        <p>''If you start devoting a lot of shelf space to a private-label product because you feel the branded price is not providing a good value to the consumer, it encourages the branded vendor to provide a lower price,'' Mr. Strachan said.</p>
        <p>Though national brands are not likely to match or undercut private-label prices -- primarily, they say, because of their advertising budgets -- the presence of a store brand can push national manufacturers to cut their profit margins at the wholesale level. That translates into lower brand-name prices for consumers, set by the retailer.</p>
        <p>Companies of all sizes, including the consumer products giants, are competing with the Wal-Mart brands. A 100-ounce jug of Sam's Choice Power Clean Formula liquid detergent, displayed front and center in the detergent aisle, costs $3.84 at the Middletown Wal-Mart. Down the row, the same size of Procter &amp; Gamble's liquid Tide costs $5.88.</p>
        <p>A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman said the company was not worried about comparisons, pointing out that Tide has been the market leader for most of its 55-year history. ''We work with Wal-Mart as with all of our customers to help build their business and help build ours,'' said the spokeswoman, Kelly Anchrum. ''We respect their decision to provide additional options for the consumer. We realize that they need to make decisions that go beyond our brands.''</p>
        <p>Information Resources Inc., a market research firm in Chicago that tracks sales in discount stores,  has recorded a jump in sales of private-label detergent in the last three years. In 1998, the private-label share of the market was just 0.5 percent; by the end of last year, it was 1.5 percent. Tide and its variants, like Ultra Tide and Ultra Tide Free, meanwhile, slipped from 37.8 percent to 36.5 percent, according to Information Resources.</p>
        <p>IN the toilet tissue aisle, price differences are equally obvious. A nine-roll package of White Cloud two-ply toilet paper, a brand that Wal-Mart acquired and began selling last year, costs much less than the nine-roll, two-ply Charmin.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble owned the White Cloud brand and sold it east of the Rocky Mountains until about 1995, when the company decided to sell only the Charmin brand. Now it finds Charmin competing against its former brand in Wal-Marts everywhere.</p>
        <p>Still, Procter &amp; Gamble is betting that customers will choose its product over Wal-Mart's. ''Value is two things: price plus performance,'' said a company spokesman, Terry Loftus. ''We work hard to get that right so consumers will choose our brands.''</p>
        <p>Other retailers have been building their private-label alternatives as well. At Kmart, licensed brands include Martha Stewart Everyday, Kathy Ireland, Jaclyn Smith and Sesame Street. The company also develops private-label foods and paper products, Michele Jasukaitis, a spokeswoman, said.</p>
        <p>''We see them as a significant and important alternative for customers as far as price is concerned,'' Ms. Jasukaitis said. ''The customers truly believe in our brands and trust them and like the fact that they are affordable.''</p>
        <p>In such a situation, of course, there are winners and losers. And one expert contends that private-label products often have the edge.</p>
        <p>''For the consumer, private label offers comparable quality at a lower price,'' said Laurel Cutler, a marketing consultant in New York. ''For the retailer, private label means a much higher margin. Who gets left out in the cold? The national brands.''</p>
