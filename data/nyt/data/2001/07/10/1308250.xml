        <p>Public Lives column profiles career of Cheryl J Hurley, chief executive of Library of America, nonprofit publishing house created by committee of scholars in 1979 to rescue great books of dead authors; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THIS country does a crummy job as guardian of great books by its dead authors. Or it used to. Edmund Wilson voiced that criticism 40 years ago, crankily and accurately. And Cheryl J.

        <p>If not for him, she might have missed her life's calling, rescuing books as the head of a patriotic nonprofit publishing house that was created by a committee of scholars in 1979 and is still going gung-ho.

        <p>THIS country does a crummy job as guardian of great books by its dead authors. Or it used to. Edmund Wilson voiced that criticism 40 years ago, crankily and accurately. And Cheryl J. Hurley, the blond-coiffed, high-heeled, ladies-who-lunch look-alike (the resemblance ends there) who is chief executive of the Library of America, is relieved that he did.</p>
        <p>If not for him, she might have missed her life's calling, rescuing books as the head of a patriotic nonprofit publishing house that was created by a committee of scholars in 1979 and is still going gung-ho. It recently dusted off Longfellow's reputation after a half-century of neglect; it will sponsor a reading of maritime works July 17 at the South Street Seaport; and in September it will revive the writings of Dawn Powell, the urbane, underappreciated New York novelist whose prose packs Dorothy Parker pungency.</p>
        <p>If not for Wilson, Ms. Hurley would be childless -- she calls the 124 omnibus volumes published during her 22-year tenure her children, remembers them in her will and hopes philanthropists with cash to burn are bitten by the book bug, too. For $50,000, a bookworm can adopt a volume in the Library of America series, guaranteeing that Frost or Fitzgerald (they're already sponsored) or Stowe, Steinbeck or Hammett (they're still available) remain in print in perpetuity. The Library of America doesn't just restore the country's literary heritage to print, it keeps it there.</p>
        <p>''We're not only a publisher, we're a cultural institution,'' observes the impeccably groomed Ms. Hurley as a rosy flush -- she doesn't mean to brag, she's just convinced of her mission's virtues -- creeps upward from the lapels of her double-breasted jacket. ''Who's looking after our literature, not just the greatest hits, but the shorter, earlier, quieter writings? To provide a comprehensive selection of an author's work, that's our passion and motivation,'' she recites, sounding zealous and then, after hearing of her interlocutor's ignorance about L.O.A., sounding miffed. ''We've got to do a better job of getting the word out.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hurley used to explain an author's eligibility for Library of America publication this way: he or she had to be great, American-born and dead. But when the Library of America found its own rule too fusty, it broke it: Vladimir Nabokov was included (Ms. Hurley considers ''Lolita'' the ''quintessential American novel''), and so was Eudora Welty, the first living author to make the cut.</p>
        <p>''She has been a great friend to us, and we wanted to do something to make her happy, and this did,'' Ms. Hurley says.</p>
        <p>WHAT else makes the Library of America indispensable? Ms. Hurley jumps up and -- Want evidence? Here's evidence -- snatches several volumes from her shelves. She publishes the authentic version, be it the poetry of Frost or the elliptical prose of Faulkner, as the author intended it. Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' is the most dramatic case in point. It seems some passages packed a double whammy of provocation, racial and sexual, in the 1940's that prompted the Book-of-the-Month Club to delete them. ''And the author agreed,'' she says sympathetically, ''because he just wanted to get his book published and seen.'' But the two L.O.A. versions of Mr. Wright's works, early and late, are printed intact, just as he wrote them. If originality offends, so be it. It also sells, and garners front-list reviews.</p>
        <p>''We have to sell a lot of books in order to survive,'' notes Ms. Hurley, whose Ford Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities seed money ran out decades ago. ''But we have a higher purpose.'' Like bringing the observations of the Boston historian Francis Parkman out of terminal hibernation, which she calls ''an important rescue.'' These days the budget is $7 million, with eight releases each year and annual sales of 250,000 units. It is, she says, a break-even pace, but she worries that only 40 of her titles have found sponsors. ''Eight new orphans a year,'' she frets.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Hurley, 53, claims to love all her children equally, she admits to loving the early Henry James a tad more passionately. He monopolizes a dozen volumes of the black dust-jacketed series filling the built-in bookcases in her charming office (French doors, bay window) in a likewise charming 1905 Beaux-Arts building at 14 East 60th Street. Her favorite haunts, the Grolier Club and the Alliance Française, are nearby. Her Francophile leanings developed as contrast to the Pittsburgh suburbs where she grew up, with her nose in a book. She was thrilled that, as Wilson had hoped, the Editions de la Pléiade, a compendium of French classics, was agreed on as a model for L.O.A. She had read them while pursuing a master's degree in French at the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hurley, who lives in Manhattan and Bridgehampton with her husband, Kevin, an economist and hedge fund specialist, came to L.O.A. with zero publishing experience but ample connections after seven years at the Modern Language Association. Two decades after Wilson raised the alarm, Richard Poirer, Jason Epstein, Dan Aaron and Tom Tanselle, literary heavyweights all, accumulated $1.8 million in start-up grants, and Ms. Hurley was enlisted ''to find the office space and buy the Xerox machine and all the rest.''</p>
        <p>''They did what any group of men does when they want something to happen: they hire a woman,'' she said. ''For the first five years, we called this 'the project.' We didn't know what it would become; we just wanted to get some books out.</p>
        <p>''By the way, please take a book when you leave,'' she suggests.</p>
        <p>Old habits die hard.</p>
