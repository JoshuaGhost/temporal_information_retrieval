        <p>TOBY, WHAT ARE YOU? By William Steig. Illustrated by Teryl Euvremer. Joanna Cotler/HarperCollins. $14.95. (Ages 2 to 6) Some domestic games that toddlers and preschoolers adore adapt perfectly as stories. Toby, the same weasel who played with his parents in ''Toby, Where Are You?,'' has returned with a related game. Father comes home and guesses (or fails to) that Toby is a doormat, a bridge, a pair of scissors, a banana sandwich and so on. Delicious fun and perhaps inspiring.</p>
        <p>ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR: The True Story of the Day America Entered World War II. By Shelley Tanaka. Illustrated by David Craig. Hyperion/Madison. $19.99. (Ages 10 and up) For youngsters who have or have not seen the action movie, but wonder just what happened on Dec. 7, 1941, here is a clear account that gives some helpful context. The narrative uses anecdotes about various Americans and Japanese, historic photographs, maps and paintings of the attack. Glossary and bibliography as well.</p>
        <p>THE VERY KIND RICH LADY AND HER ONE HUNDRED DOGS. Written and illustrated by Chinlun Lee. Candlewick. $15.99. (Ages 2 and up) The title tells the whole story. What follows is an enchanting explication of how the lady acquired, named and now cares for all those dogs, including ''Bingo, who was always late.'' The illustrations suggest the personalities of every dog. Plenty to discuss as well as count.</p>
        <p>I LOVE GOING THROUGH THIS BOOK. By Robert Burleigh. Illustrated by Dan Yaccarino. Joanna Cotler/HarperCollins. $15.95. (Ages 4 to 8) A circular tale. The young narrator proceeds through these pages with assorted animal companions, reaches the end and begins again.</p>
        <p>ALL THAT REMAINS. By Bruce Brooks. Atheneum. $16. (Ages 12 and up) In these three short novellas, each about young teenagers dealing with horrific turns of fate -- a beloved aunt dies of AIDS, a deathbed promise must be kept, and a golfing companion carries a grisly burden in his backpack -- common sense, good will and wit prevail.</p>
        <p>CARVER: A Life in Poems. By Marilyn Nelson. Front Street. $16.95. (Ages 12 and up) Nearly 60 poems, mostly short, have been arranged chronologically to tell the story of George Washington Carver. The botanist and inventor was born a slave around 1864. Raised by a childless white couple, he eventually became the head of the agricultural department at Tuskeegee Institute. He was also a painter and an inventor. The handsome book is footnoted with biographical detail and decorated with photographs.</p>
        <p>SALLY GOES TO THE MOUNTAINS. Written and illustrated by Stephen Huneck. Abrams. $17.95. (Ages 3 to 6) Sally is a black Labrador retriever, and in her second holiday trip, this time to the mountains, she dreams of what she will see. The distinctive woodcut illustrations are handsome and witty.</p>
        <p>AUNT CLAIRE'S YELLOW BEEHIVE HAIR. By Deborah Blumenthal. Illustrated by Mary GrandPré. Dial. $15.99. (Ages 5 to 9) One rainy day, Annie and her grandmother start going through family memorabilia. A family history lesson.</p>
