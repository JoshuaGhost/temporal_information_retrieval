        <p>Now that Beijing has been awarded the 2008 Summer Games, delegates of the International Olympic Committee have turned their attention to a vote they consider more important, electing a replacement for the president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, on Monday.</p>

        <p>Now that Beijing has been awarded the 2008 Summer Games, delegates of the International Olympic Committee have turned their attention to a vote they consider more important, electing a replacement for the president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, on Monday.</p>
        <p>Samaranch has held the position so long -- since 1980 -- that only 13 of the 122 current delegates have voted in a presidential election that did not include him. Conventional wisdom holds that Jacques Rogge, an orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, is the favorite among five candidates in a European-dominated organization.</p>
        <p>Some believe that Dick Pound, an influential lawyer from Montreal, is making a late charge. Anita DeFrantz of the United States and Pal Schmitt of Hungary are considered to have no realistic shot at winning. Depending on the point of view, the most intriguing or troubling candidate is 70-year-old Kim Un Yong of South Korea, a powerful delegate with political contacts in Washington and also a candidate whose reputation has been damaged by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.</p>
        <p>Kim received a ''most severe'' warning from the I.O.C. during the scandal, and his son, known as John Kim, was indicted on charges of receiving a sham job paid for by the bid committee for the 2002 Winter Games. It was only because of his influential status that the senior Kim was not thrown out of the I.O.C. Two years ago, his political fortunes seemed doomed.</p>
        <p>Yet, he has been a master at rehabilitating his image, coalescing an apparently strong base in the developing nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and regaining enough political ballast that some insiders now consider him the favorite to succeed Samaranch. Kim would be the first nonwhite president of the I.O.C. in the more than 100 years of the modern Games and the first from Asia.</p>
        <p>''He has the wisdom of the East and the efficiency of the West,'' Ashwini Kumar, a recently retired delegate from India, said of Kim.</p>
        <p>More than any other, his candidacy has brought sharp lines of division among those affiliated with the Olympic movement. To some, a Kim victory would symbolize the universal nature of the I.O.C., a welcome departure from its Eurocentric nature and a renewed commitment to assisting less fortunate countries. He is a member of the committee's executive board and has experience negotiating billion-dollar television rights.</p>
        <p>To others, a victorious Kim would represent a more disturbing side of the Olympic committee -- its perceived history as an autocratic, secretive, corrupt, elitist organization -- and would cast doubt on reforms that were supposed to make the I.O.C. a more transparent, accountable, businesslike operation. It has escaped no one that the man whose career was nearly capsized by the Salt Lake City scandal may now open the 2002 Winter Games in the same city, this time as one of the most recognizable and powerful figures in international sport.</p>
        <p>''Having him win would be terrible,'' said Kevin Wamsley, a history professor and director of the International Center for Olympic Studies at the University of Western Ontario. ''It would verify that reform was a joke.''</p>
        <p>Because Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympics, some observers speculate, a global organization such as the I.O.C. would seem unlikely to elect an Asian president at the moment. But Kim believes that his diplomatic experience uniquely qualifies him to handle the challenging political issues that will inevitably mark the next seven years as China prepares to play host to the Games for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Who can best deal with issues in China, or between China and the U.S.?'' Kim said earlier this week. ''I don't see anyone else.''</p>
        <p>A member of the South Korean parliament, Kim serves as a special adviser to the country's president, Kim Dae Jung. He was instrumental in arranging for North and South Korean athletes to march in unison at the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and he appeared in photographs as part of the official delegation at last year's historic governmental summit between the two countries.</p>
        <p>He heads a committee on South Korea's governmental relations with the United States and represented the country at the inauguration of President George W. Bush. Kim attended Texas Western (now called the University of Texas at El Paso) and twice trained at Fort Benning, Ga., during the Korean War. A student of American history, he rattles off dates and facts about everything from Jamestown to the Alamo.</p>
        <p>And he has the support of the United States Olympic Committee, which officially advocates DeFrantz, but which is also aware that one of the world's most hidebound old-boy networks is not yet ready to elect a female I.O.C. president. Still, the U.S.O.C. is looking to protect its own interests. New York and seven other American cities are seeking to play host to the 2012 Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Kim is a smart man who understands sport,'' said Sandy Baldwin, president of the U.S.O.C. ''He is a friend of the U.S. I believe, if he is elected, he would work very, very diligently to continue the reforms.''</p>
        <p>She said she believed that the dredging up of the Salt Lake City scandal with his election, and the effect on the I.O.C.'s reputation, would amount only to ''two or three days of bad press.''</p>
        <p>But some influential officials are extremely concerned about how the I.O.C.'s worldwide corporate sponsors -- most, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's, based in the United States -- would react to a Kim presidency.</p>
        <p>David D'Alessandro, the president and chief operating officer of the John Hancock Corporation, said in an interview before the Sydney Olympics that sponsors might exercise the so-called morals clause in their contracts and begin to withdraw at the first whiff of scandal. Recently, he told The Associated Press that the I.O.C. ''can't possibly be that arrogant and obtuse'' to elect Kim.</p>
        <p>''It would be a terrible slap in the face of everyone associated with the Olympics,'' D'Alessandro said.</p>
        <p>Kim was handed a warning by the I.O.C. over the issue of influence peddling and nepotism, including his son's allegedly sham job and piano recitals conducted by his daughter in various cities bidding on the Games. During Seoul's bid for the 1988 Summer Games, Kim was said by other delegates to have stuck first-class airline tickets under the hotel room doors of I.O.C. members, expecting them to cash the tickets in, in order to curry their vote for the South Korean city.</p>
        <p>He has denied any wrongdoing and has traveled freely to the United States several times since the Salt Lake City scandal, including a trip to meet with Congressional leaders last month. John Kim, who has surrendered his green card and returned to South Korea, has also denied any wrongdoing. Kim Un Yong noted that his son had won a defamation suit related to the Salt Lake City episode in a Korean court.</p>
        <p>''I'm a benefit giver, not taker,'' Kim Un Yong said.</p>
        <p>While the I.O.C. was determining whether to censure Kim in early 1999, a meeting grew so testy one day in Lausanne, Switzerland, that observers said they saw Kim assume a martial arts pose toward Pound, who headed the investigation, and toward François Carrard, the executive director of the I.O.C.</p>
        <p>Carrard reportedly fled the room, and both he and Pound joked about the matter the next day. Kim, who is president of the world taekwondo federation, denied that he struck any threatening pose.</p>
        <p>The other day, in a more jocular mood, he used his feisty sense of humor when referring to his skill at taekwondo. Asked if his age might be held against him in the voting for president, he laughed, and said referring to the other I.O.C. candidates that he was still nimble enough at martial arts to ''take the other four on at one time.''</p>
        <p>Numerous published reports have mentioned that Kim was perhaps a member of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency earlier in his career. ''Why must I answer such questions?'' he said. He does say that he was deputy director of the presidential protection force -- a paramilitary group -- assigned to the country's late dictator, Park Chung Hee, who was assassinated in 1979.</p>
        <p>''Bush was C.I.A., Putin was K.G.B., but I was not a spy,'' Kim said, referring to former President George Bush, who once headed the C.I.A., and to Vladimir Putin, the current president of Russia.</p>
        <p>Kim would prefer to speak about the $330,000 in personal money from his real estate fortune that he has given to developing nations in the name of sport.</p>
        <p>Nearly expelled from the I.O.C. two years ago, Kim now positions himself as the committee's moral force, seeking to restore Olympic ideals that, he says, have been compromised by bloated size, overcommercialism and performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>''The ideals are not destroyed, but I think a scar has been inflicted,'' Kim said. ''If we don't uphold the ideals, we are nothing but a big-event organizer with no respect and no dignity.''</p>
        <p>Last February, at an I.O.C. meeting in Dakar, Senegal, Kim said he was only half joking when he suggested that Salt Lake City bid officials should have offered more scholarships to families of African delegates. ''Many of these kids have no shoes, no sports programs,'' Kim said. ''You have to try to help them.''</p>
        <p>Reform does not mean restricting gift limits to $200, he said, but it is an evolutionary process of restructuring. Kim said he would attempt to restore visits by delegates to cities bidding on the Games. The practice was halted after more than $1 million in cash and excessive favors were handed out by Salt Lake City bid officials. To forbid visits is to intimate that all members are corrupt, he said.</p>
        <p>''I hope they will judge me on what I've done for the Olympics and humanitarian causes in helping athletes from less-developed countries,'' Kim said. ''The Olympics rings are five rings, not one ring.''</p>
