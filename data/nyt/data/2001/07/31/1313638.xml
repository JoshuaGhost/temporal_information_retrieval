      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Shifting its pricing strategies again, the Kmart Corporation said yesterday that it would reduce the price of monthly Internet access through its BlueLight.com premium service and eliminate its free basic service. BlueLight, an independent company in which Kmart holds a majority ownership, said that at $8.95 a month, the new service is the lowest-priced major provider offering unlimited Internet access. The company currently charges its subscribers $9.95 a month for 100 hours of Internet access. Until February BlueLight offered consumers free, unlimited Internet access. As the Internet advertising market sank however, BlueLight began limiting free use of its service to 12 hours a month and charging those who wanted more time. Kmart said yesterday that remaining subscribers to this free basic service would be disconnected on  Aug. 29.</p>
