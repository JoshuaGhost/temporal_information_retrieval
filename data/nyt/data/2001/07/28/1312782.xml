        <p>Re ''Open Door, Open Questions; This Way Up'' (Week in Review, July 22): President Bush wants to legalize the status of many undocumented Mexican workers, in part, it seems, to gain votes for Republicans. President Vicente Fox of Mexico seems to be hoping that grateful Mexicans who move to the United States will be able to vote for him by absentee ballot. Who knew there could be so many opportunities to vote?</p>

        <p>As a Canadian living in the United States as a resident alien, I cannot vote here, even though I have been paying American taxes for eight years. Nor can I vote in Canadian elections, since in order to obtain a ballot, I would have to sign a form stating that it is my intention to  move back to Canada someday.</p>
