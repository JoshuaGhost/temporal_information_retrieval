        <p>As a result of growth in the number of mutual funds, The Times is eliminating entries for some of the smallest ones and making its daily table more concise.</p>
        <p>Beginning today, the table will list Nasdaq funds with assets of $50 million or more, no longer $30 million. The funds to be omitted -- accounting for 18 percent of the space formerly occupied by The Times's table -- represent slightly more than 1 percent of the total money invested in the listed funds. When a fund offers more than one share class, its classes will be grouped, no longer listed in separate categories.</p>

        <p>As a result of growth in the number of mutual funds, The Times is eliminating entries for some of the smallest ones and making its daily table more concise.</p>
        <p>Beginning today, the table will list Nasdaq funds with assets of $50 million or more, no longer $30 million. The funds to be omitted -- accounting for 18 percent of the space formerly occupied by The Times's table -- represent slightly more than 1 percent of the total money invested in the listed funds. When a fund offers more than one share class, its classes will be grouped, no longer listed in separate categories.</p>
        <p>On Sundays in Money &amp; Business, the mutual funds table will continue to list funds with assets of $30 million or more, but grouped as they are in the daily table. The order of fund family names will change slightly.</p>
        <p>Information on more than 12,000 mutual funds is available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com/ business.</p>
        <p>Comments about the changes may be e-mailed to tables@nytimes.com or telephoned to (212) 556-8443.</p>
