        <p>Universal Studios, owned by Vivendi Universal, said yesterday that it had begun a review for its theme-park advertising account, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million.</p>
        <p>''We want to take our future marketing to a whole new level with some bold goals and new partners,'' said Jim Canfield, a spokesman for Universal, confirming a report of the review this week in Adweek.</p>
        <p>Mr. Canfield declined to say whether the incumbent agency of more than three years -- Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising -- would be invited to take part in the review. He declined to identify any of the agencies being asked to participate.</p>
        <p>The assignment includes campaigns for Universal Studios Hollywood in California and Universal Orlando in Florida. A decision is expected by the end of the summer.</p>
