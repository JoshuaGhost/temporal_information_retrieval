        <hl1>Mrs. Clinton's Unsteady Start</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton to address questions about her ethics that have accumulated in recent days and to make clear she intends to set higher standard for service as US senator; cites $8 million book contract, four-year total of gifts she and husband took from wealthy friends and her presence at pardon discussions between Pres Clinton and four Hasidic constituents that entangled her in 'horrendous abuse of power' by husband (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton won a historic election victory in November and brings to office a combination of conviction and compassion that ought to make her a distinguished member of the Senate. But Mrs. Clinton will not realize her potential unless she makes a clean break with the unseemly ethical standards that have clouded her entry into the Senate and her last days as first lady. She ought to forthrightly address the questions that have accumulated in recent days and make clear that she intends to set a higher standard for her service as a senator.</p>
        <p>As the nation learned during her husband's presidency, ethical insensitivity seems to come with the Clintons. Certainly, Bill Clinton's leavetaking from the White House set a new benchmark for bad judgment by a departing president. Many of his last-minute pardons were so shockingly indefensible as to be denounced by his own party and his most loyal supporters in New York. He overstayed his welcome in Washington on Inauguration Day by staging a long farewell rally at Andrews Air Force Base shortly after George W. Bush was sworn in as the new president. Now Mr. Clinton plans to rent a midtown Manhattan office overlooking Central Park that will apparently cost the federal treasury more than the combined annual office expenses of the four other retired presidents.</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton won a historic election victory in November and brings to office a combination of conviction and compassion that ought to make her a distinguished member of the Senate. But Mrs. Clinton will not realize her potential unless she makes a clean break with the unseemly ethical standards that have clouded her entry into the Senate and her last days as first lady. She ought to forthrightly address the questions that have accumulated in recent days and make clear that she intends to set a higher standard for her service as a senator.</p>
        <p>As the nation learned during her husband's presidency, ethical insensitivity seems to come with the Clintons. Certainly, Bill Clinton's leavetaking from the White House set a new benchmark for bad judgment by a departing president. Many of his last-minute pardons were so shockingly indefensible as to be denounced by his own party and his most loyal supporters in New York. He overstayed his welcome in Washington on Inauguration Day by staging a long farewell rally at Andrews Air Force Base shortly after George W. Bush was sworn in as the new president. Now Mr. Clinton plans to rent a midtown Manhattan office overlooking Central Park that will apparently cost the federal treasury more than the combined annual office expenses of the four other retired presidents.</p>
        <p>In most states of the union, of course, citizens can simply register their weariness with the Clinton era and go on to other matters. But in New York, questions about Mrs. Clinton's involvement in her husband's decisions and whether she will adopt his lax leadership standards now bear on the performance of a sitting senator.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has said she wants to leave the turmoil of the last eight years behind, but her behavior since the election and even since her swearing in has sent a different message. We say this as an editorial page that endorsed her and regards her as a potential champion of the social welfare and civil rights issues on which a senator from New York can be a major force. Her potential will be dwarfed if she follows her husband's example and defines acceptable political conduct as being anything that the law or public fatigue allows you to get away with. It is imperative that she construct an independent political persona.</p>
        <p>Three specific examples come to mind as places where Mrs. Clinton could have defined herself as a more attractive role model than her husband. Her $8 million book contract, while legal under Senate rules, puts her in a financial relationship with a large company, Viacom, that has business interests before the Senate. She should at least limit the advance she receives and take further payment in the form of royalty income after publication.</p>
        <p>The four-year total of gifts that she and her husband took from wealthy friends was, as Mrs. Clinton notes, not out of proportion with other first families. But the Clintons' gifts came in a glut in the last year, when she should have been putting her new role as an incoming senator ahead of her transitory status as a departing first lady.</p>
        <p>Most seriously, her presence at pardon discussions between her husband and four of her Hasidic constituents from New Square, N.Y., entangled her in a horrendous abuse of power by her husband.</p>
        <p>We think it is within the rights of every New Yorker to expect Mrs. Clinton to avoid the grasping approach to political money that was a hallmark of her husband's administration and to promise in a public way to avoid entanglement in compromising political deals. Someone who aspires to be a great senator must press beyond the question whether a specific gift, contribution or political intervention is strictly legal. That kind of senator will also ask whether his or her actions add up to a picture of dignity and good judgment.</p>
