        <p>Digital Island Inc., a San Francisco-based Internet infrastructure company, said yesterday that it expects to break even by June 2002, two quarters earlier than expected. With $439 million in cash and marketable securities, the company said it was fully funded until then. In the quarter ending June 2002, the company expects its revenues to match expenditures on a cash-flow basis. For the current year, the company lowered its annual revenue expectations by $20 million, to between $170 million and $175 million. It said it would cut capital outlays by $75 million, to $225 million, and predicted that its annual loss would beat Wall Street's estimates of $7.51 a share by 6 cents. For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the company said it lost $142.5 million, or $1.82 a share, matching analysts' expectations. T. L. Thompson, chief financial officer, said Digital Island had gained only 10 customers during the last quarter, bringing its roster to 959, partly because of its decision to shed smaller customers.</p>
