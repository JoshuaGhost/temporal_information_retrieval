        <p>Vornado Realty Trust has emerged as the high bidder for the largest commercial real estate complex of all: the 110-story Twin Towers and World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But that does not necessarily mean that Vornado will take home the prize. Two rivals raised their bids last week in a late attempt to get the property. As a result, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center, is still checking the fine print in the offers and may not complete its review in time to designate a winner at its board meeting tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The offers for a 99-year lease on the 10 million-square-foot complex are now near or above $3 billion, twice what was estimated in 1998.</p>
        <p>The World Trade Center, which opened in 1970, sits on 16 acres and has more than seven times the office space in the Empire State Building. After discussing the matter for years, the authority decided in 1998 to leave the real estate business.</p>
        <p>''The World Trade Center is world-class office space at an internationally known address,'' said Mitchell S. Steir, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley Inc., a real estate brokerage firm. But it does have a drawback: when the stock market is troubled, ''the downtown market always suffers a little more pain than Midtown,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the negotiations, Vornado bid about $3.25 billion for the complex, which put the company more than $500 million ahead of competing offers from Silverstein Properties and a joint bid by Boston Properties and Brookfield Financial Properties.</p>
        <p>The authority then asked the other two bidders to increase their offers. They did. Silverstein Properties, whose partners include Westfield America and GMAC, is now within $30 million of Vornado, the executives said. At the same time, Boston Properties and Brookfield, once considered the sure winner, raised their offer to about $3 billion.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and DE Beitler, the companies that have run the auction and advised the authority, are to meet today to look through the offers. Tomorrow morning, an authority committee will decide whether to recommend that the entire board designate a winner and begin full contract negotiations, a process that could take the rest of the year.</p>
        <p>The authority has sidestepped one thorny issue. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has insisted that the authority put the World Trade Center on the city's tax rolls. The authority gives the city a payment in lieu of taxes, about $29 million last year, but city officials say that is only a fourth of what the property taxes would be.</p>
        <p>But rather than negotiate with Mr. Giuliani, authority officials decided to wait to deal with the mayor's successor, and in the meantime will be responsible for any increase in the payments.</p>
