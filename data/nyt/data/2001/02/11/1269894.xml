        <p>A UESTION of whether new power lines should be put underground has sharpened more than purely geographic divisions between the North and South Forks.</p>
        <p>Trouble began when the Long Island Power Authority announced plans last year to string new power lines on an existing 21-mile right-of-way from a substation in Riverhead east through farmlands to a substation near Greenport.</p>
        <p>LIPA said the project, estimated at $18 million, would replace 1920's-vintage latticework transmission towers with steel poles and would upgrade lines from 23 to 69 kilovolts. The extra power, it said, would be needed on the North Fork in the future.</p>
        <p>Officials and residents on the North Fork exploded, however, demanding to know why LIPA wanted to run the new lines overhead down the North Fork's scenic spine when it had buried lines in Southampton on the South Fork in a similar project completed last May.</p>
        <p>The controversy may be a preview of what lies ahead for other areas of Long Island where power grid upgrades and tie-ins for new generating stations raise similar pressures for underground cables. Richard M. Kessel, the LIPA chairman, has warned that new power plants and transmission lines are necessary to avoid future power shortages.</p>
        <p>But on the East End, sensibilities on the twin forks are an added twist. Even bragging rights to original English settlement are unresolved. Southold and Southampton both date their founding to 1640 and claim to be first.</p>
        <p>In more recent times, the South Fork evolved into the fashionable Hamptons, the resort known round the world. The North Fork, never awash in the wealth that transformed and rarefied the South Fork, clung more easily to its agrarian roots but resented playing poor cousin.</p>
        <p>The forks are joined in some matters. Residents of both share an agricultural and maritime history, revere open spaces and share a deep-seated if quixotic interest in seceding from Suffolk County to form a county called Peconic.</p>
        <p>But no one wants to be slighted. In the North Fork view, burying power cables on the South Fork but not on the North Fork crosses the line. Many suspect their wealthy neighbors to the south got special treatment.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that, had the authority proposed an above-ground route over there, there would have been a lot of screaming and shouting,'' said William D. Moore, a Southold Town councilman. ''We simply want them to know we can yell and scream and make the same kind of noise on this side.''</p>
        <p>LIPA said the South Fork project, which cost $70 million, took advantage of easily obtained rights-of-way along Sunrise Highway, a Suffolk County road and the Long Island Rail Road to carve a new 22-mile underground corridor taking up to 138 kilovolts.</p>
        <p>LIPA said the new line, which begins at the Riverhead substation and is currently operating at 69 kilovolts, addressed a growing energy crisis on the South Fork, where rapid second-home development spurred increases in demand that nearly caused local blackouts in July 1999. Planning for that project began after that summer, and work began in February 2000.</p>
        <p>Putting the new lines underground on the North Fork, LIPA said, would require renegotiating more than 150 easements with private landowners and tens of millions of dollars in additional expense.</p>
        <p>People on the North Fork are unconvinced by such arguments.</p>
        <p>''They were getting pressure from big-money interests on the South Fork and they knuckled under there, but they are not treating us fair on the North Fork,'' said Howard Mein ke, president of the North Fork Environmental Council in Mattituck. ''Digging is easy on the North Fork.''</p>
        <p>Faced with the outcry, LIPA has agreed to study alternatives for the North Fork project. Bert J. Cunningham, LIPA's vice president for communications, said last week that the alternatives include burying some or all of the new lines along the existing corridor, or placing them underground or above ground along the Long Island Rail Road corridor.</p>
        <p>Another alternative under study, Mr. Cunningham said, was to bury the new lines along the north side of Sound Avenue, which runs from Riverhead to Greenport. He said that existing 69-kilovolt lines built in the 1970's, which run overhead on wooden poles along the south side of the road, would remain.</p>
        <p>Sound Avenue is a tree-lined two-lane road in Riverhead that widens to four lanes in parts of Southold. It passes through the heart of the North Fork farming and vineyard area and is widely regarded as one of Long Island's most picturesque roads.</p>
        <p>An opponent of the new overhead lines said Sound Avenue would be improved by burying the new lines and the existing 69-kilovolt lines along the existing right-of-way on the road's south side. ''The right thing to do is to bury them all,'' said Alex Wipf of Cutchogue, a member of Save Open Spaces Now 2000, a Southold-based environmental group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said he did not believe LIPA was studying burying all lines on Sound Avenue.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to give the impression that any of these plans have been finalized,'' he said. ''There is going to be some pretty detailed evaluation. We have to do some preliminary cost estimates, and we have to take a look not only at the cost of the cable but the costs involved in excavating and trenching work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said he did not know when LIPA would make a decision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wipf also said the North Fork did not need the additional power the new lines would bring. LIPA's true purpose, he said, was to back up its South Fork system. Transmission lines that run across Shelter Island connect the two forks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said this was a secondary consideration of a project designed primarily to meet future North Fork demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, the town councilman, said Southold officials had advised LIPA that only one outcome was acceptable: underground lines. ''If they can justify it in Southampton,'' he said, ''they can justify it here.''</p>
        <p>The town's position is strengthened by its jurisdiction over one aspect of the project. Gregory Yakaboski, the town attorney, said LIPA would need a town permit to expand the substation near Greenport.</p>
        <p>For LIPA, the Southampton project has had even wider repercussions. ''Other communities throughout Long Island are requesting that we underground transmission lines where possible when we are coming in with new lines,'' Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
        <p>He said LIPA would ''try to accommodate the communities as best we can,'' but noted that putting lines underground was ''exceptionally expensive'' and complicated by easement problems and the difficulty of excavating in areas where other utility pipelines and cables were already buried.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meinke of the North Fork Environmental Council said LIPA was exaggerating the obstacles to going underground on the North Fork. ''I don't think any real cost estimates have been done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham denied that the South Fork got special treatment. ''We are not discriminating against the North Fork,'' he said. ''We didn't knuckle under to the South Fork. We made what was thought to be a practical decision at the time, given the circumstances we were confronted with.''</p>
