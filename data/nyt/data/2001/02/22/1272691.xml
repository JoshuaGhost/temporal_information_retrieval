        <p>The challenges Lucent Technologies faced refinancing its debt the last week demonstrate just how wary bankers have suddenly become, according to several leading lenders. This caution comes despite attempts by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, backed up by two sharp rate cuts, to foster more vigorous lending.</p>
        <p>While Lucent, a leading telecommunications equipment maker that was once a star spinoff from AT&amp;T, has had its share of reversals, it retains an investment-grade credit rating. But bankers have become especially reluctant to lend money to highly leveraged or struggling companies.</p>
        <p>The bankers say their caution is appropriate. ''We see continued signs of weakness in elements of the economy and the way large companies are performing,'' said John McLean Jr., head of corporate banking and capital markets at Wachovia. ''If it's raining and it starts coming down in torrents, you drive slower.''</p>
        <p>The volume of new loans being raised by companies rated below investment grade -- double B or lower -- is down 40 percent so far this year from last year's pace, according to S&amp;P/Portfolio Management Data, which tracks such financings. These figures do not include a handful of deals by companies like Lucent, whose debt is rated investment grade but whose loans are being marketed to buyers of debt from highly leveraged companies.</p>
        <p>''This is as difficult a time in the loan market as I've seen in 10 years,'' said one banker involved in the Lucent financing.</p>
        <p>Bankers tightened up last fall after regulators warned about increased problem loans. But Mr. Greenspan, fearful about the economic slowdown, said more recently that the banks might have overreacted.</p>
        <p>Many banks are concerned about the number of onetime blue-chip companies running into trouble over the last year, including Xerox, the Finova Group and Owens Corning. ''The shadow of Xerox is immense,'' said Christopher Donnelly, a director at S&amp;P/Portfolio Management Data.</p>
        <p>Banks have also been forced to set more money aside to cover loan losses in recent months, and some are balking at financings that might risk future losses. Wachovia is reluctant to continue lending to Lucent, according to other banks involved in the deal. It has made loans to several other companies that are now struggling, including Federal-Mogul, W. R. Grace, Owens-Illinois, Armstrong World Industries and Owens Corning, according to research by Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>Wachovia executives would not comment specifically on whether they had agreed to take part in the Lucent refinancing. But Mr. McLean said that the bank was taking a more cautious approach to large corporate loans over all, especially when the bank had no other relationship with the borrower.</p>
        <p>As of late yesterday, it looked as if Lucent would succeed in renewing a $2 billion credit line scheduled to expire today. Henry B. Schacht, Lucent's chief executive, told shareholders at its annual meeting in Florida yesterday that Lucent expected to close the financing by today, a spokeswoman confirmed.</p>
        <p>But Lucent was clearly surprised by the difficulty it had assembling a group of banks to provide the money. Weeks ago, it received indications from most of the 30 banks in its lending group that they would renew the loan.</p>
        <p>It was only last week, when Lucent sought to seal the commitments, that many banks began to waiver. As of late yesterday, Wachovia and Wells Fargo had not decided whether to lend, according to a banker involved. He refused to be identified for fear of disrupting the negotiations. Wells Fargo declined to comment on the Lucent financing.</p>
        <p>Lucent's lead banks, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, as well as Mr. Schacht, were forced to lobby the group aggressively. Several senior executives at Morgan Chase took part, including William Repko, who heads the bank's corporate restructuring group.</p>
        <p>Banks and other institutional lenders are also more reluctant to take risks because, as trading in pieces of these loans has increased in recent years, they are under pressure from regulators and investors to value loans based on their market prices. Previously, lenders carried loans on their books at 100 cents on the dollar, as long as the company was still making payments. But corporate reversals can promptly cause the market value of the loans to fall.</p>
        <p>Many institutions investing in loans are instead favoring the secondary market, where they can buy loans at discounts. ''The volume of secondary trading has never been greater,'' said Stephen Hickey, co-head of the bank debt group at Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>Even as banks have been reluctant to lend to highly leveraged companies, some issuers have found a warm reception in the high-yield bond market. Investor demand for new junk bond offerings has been robust so far this year, with volume to date at $18 billion, close to four times the figure in the period last year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.</p>
        <p>Some companies seeking to both borrow from banks and sell junk bonds are tilting the mix toward bonds, which typically carry less restrictive terms than those of loan financings.</p>
        <p>This month, Levi Strauss raised $1 billion from loans and $500 million from junk bonds. The company had originally sought last fall to reduce its bank borrowings to around $1.3 billion by raising $350 million from bonds. But it took advantage of the recovery in the junk bond market to increase the portion of high-yield debt, a company spokeswoman said.</p>
