        <p>The assignment: design two markedly different Paris restaurants for the celebrated chef Alain Ducasse. The fellow who received the commission was Patrick Jouin, 33, who has worked with Philippe Starck. The interiors at both the Plaza Athénée (above left) at 25, avenue Montaigne, and 59 Poincaré (above right) at 59, avenue Raymond-Poincaré), were landmarks, so Mr. Jouin injected contemporary notes with the furnishings. The chandeliers at the Plaza Athénée were ''beautiful but banal,'' he said, ''so I had the idea to gently disturb them by wrapping them in a tube of sheer white.'' He brought stainless steel, glass and marble to the other restaurant. ''The seating is something between a bar stool and a chair, with metallic legs and white leather upholstery,'' he said. Patrick Jouin: 011.33.1.44.76.06.22.</p>
