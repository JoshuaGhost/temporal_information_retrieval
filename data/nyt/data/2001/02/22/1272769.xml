        <p>In the latest skirmish over the city's campaign finance system, a City Council committee adopted legislation yesterday to try to block a legal challenge to the system by the mayor.</p>
        <p>The Committee on Governmental Operations unanimously approved amendments to reinforce the 1998 law that created the city's election financing formula. The formula, one of the nation's most generous, in most cases provides $4 in city money for each $1 raised by candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who sued in January to throw out the formula, said yesterday through a spokesman, Michael Anton, that he would veto the Council's legislation if it was passed. The entire Council is scheduled to vote on the legislation Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The mayor has repeatedly argued that the system wastes city money, enabling too many Council candidates to spend too much on advertising and political consultants. At a news conference yesterday, he went further, saying that it could lead to collusion among candidates and their paid advisers.</p>
        <p>''This is a dangerous thing we are doing,'' said Mr. Giuliani, who warned that candidates might agree privately to compete for office, only to withdraw after they had obtained campaign subsidies and had paid their consultants. ''I predict this will result in some real problems and scandal.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said the campaign finance formula would be particularly costly for the city this year, because term limits had already drawn more than 160 candidates into Council races, and more were expected. He said the city's bill could reach $110 million, but an estimate by the city's Independent Budget Office set the cost at $50 million to $60 million.</p>
        <p>Despite the mayor's strenuous objections, one of his senior advisers, who insisted that his name not be used, said yesterday that the legislation pending before the Council would ''probably make moot'' the mayor's legal challenge.</p>
        <p>The mayor's lawsuit argues that  the 1998 law was intended to offer a four-to-one financing formula to candidates on the condition that they forgo corporate contributions, and was therefore pre-empted by a separate 1998 revision of the City Charter that made such contributions illegal.</p>
        <p>''Taxpayers would be forced into the absurd position of rewarding participating candidates for not engaging in illegal conduct,'' said Joshua D. Filler, the mayor's director of city legislative affairs, in a memo to the Council yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's pledge to veto an amended campaign finance bill appeared to place him at loggerheads yesterday with Council opponents, who appeared capable of mustering the 34 votes needed to override a veto. Their support of the four-to-one formula is buttressed by the four Democrats running for mayor and by several government watchdog groups and civic organizations.</p>
        <p>''This is about good government,'' said Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker and one of the Democrats hoping to succeed Mr. Giuliani. ''We should not stall the nation's best finance program over litigious wrangling that will only hurt our election process.''</p>
