        <p>The Boston Globe printed a front-page apology yesterday retracting a report that investigators believed the murder of two Dartmouth College professors was likely to have been ''a crime of passion, most likely resulting from an adulterous love affair'' involving one of the victims, Half Zantop.</p>
        <p>The report, about the killing of Mr. Zantop and his wife, Susanne, had been based on interviews with anonymous law enforcement officials. Globe editors said that the original report, published on the front page Friday under a three-column headline, accurately represented the views of those officials at the time but that new developments had altered the investigators' conclusions.</p>

        <p>The Boston Globe printed a front-page apology yesterday retracting a report that investigators believed the murder of two Dartmouth College professors was likely to have been ''a crime of passion, most likely resulting from an adulterous love affair'' involving one of the victims, Half Zantop.</p>
        <p>The report, about the killing of Mr. Zantop and his wife, Susanne, had been based on interviews with anonymous law enforcement officials. Globe editors said that the original report, published on the front page Friday under a three-column headline, accurately represented the views of those officials at the time but that new developments had altered the investigators' conclusions.</p>
        <p>In the apology, The Globe's editor, Matthew V. Storin, wrote: ''We put our trust in three law-enforcement officials who we had every reason to believe had intimate, up-to-date knowledge of the investigation. It was certainly never our intent to increase the suffering of the Zantop family, their friends, or the Dartmouth College community, and we express regret for the pain our story undoubtedly caused them.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, the day the original report was published, it was criticized as inaccurate by New Hampshire's attorney general, Philip T. McLaughlin. Friends of the Zantops said they were outraged that The Globe would print such accusations about a murder victim.</p>
        <p>Late last week, Mr. McLaughlin's office issued warrants for Robert W. Tulloch, 17, and James J. Parker, 16, both of Chelsea, Vt. On Monday, Mr. Tulloch and Mr. Parker were arrested at an Indiana truck stop.</p>
        <p>Ben Bradlee Jr., the deputy managing editor, who was overseeing the Zantop coverage, said yesterday: ''We had solid sources developed by two of our best and most experienced reporters who were giving us information which we had every reason to believe was true and correct. And these sources are authoritative. We're not talking about campus cops who just fell off the turnip truck.''</p>
        <p>The article indicated that the theory was speculative, that ''the sources declined to say how they developed their theory'' and that investigators ''remained open to other possibilities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Storin, asked about reporting on continuing investigations, said: ''The easy thing to say would be that you're not going to try to report on the progress of investigations. I just think that's unrealistic.''</p>
        <p>The Globe is owned by The New York Times Company.</p>
