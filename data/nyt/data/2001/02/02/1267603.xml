        <p>Dr. T and the Women</p>
        <p>Portraying Dallas's leading gynecologist, Richard Gere (left, with Helen Hunt) seems to be having the time of his life in this Robert Altman film. Like Job, though, Dr. T has problems that won't let him alone. For one, his wife (Farah Fawcett) cavorts naked in a shopping mall before being carted off. Then a betrothed daughter (Kate Hudson) seems to be carrying a torch for her maid of honor (Liv Tyler), and a divorced sister-in-law (Laura Dern) blows into his life with three daughters in tow. Finally, he has a crush on the new golf pro (Ms. Hunt). While the sexual politics may be contrived, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, ''the slightly anachronistic absurdity of the conceit -- the travails of a lone gentleman in a world of ladies -- gives the actors room to do some wonderful work.''</p>
        <p>2000. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 121 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Feb. 6.</p>

        <p>Alice and Martin</p>
        <p>As in the best of his films (''Ma Saison Préférée,'' ''Wild Reeds''), André Téchiné's superb craftsmanship occurs almost as a byproduct of his concentration on the novelistic fine grain of his story. And as in a good novel, the story of the handsome, delicate Martin (Alexis Loret) and his brother's roommate, Alice (Juliet Binoche), resists summary. As the characters proceed almost without speech or exposition, the viewer must grapple with a narrative that swerves with whiplash suddenness. But work a bit, and ''your attention is rewarded by a film of surprising depth and a few deep surprises'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. USA. $90.86. 123 minutes. French with English subtitles. R.</p>
        <p>The Five Senses</p>
        <p>Rona (Mary-Louise Parker) and her best friend, Robert (Daniel Mac Ivor), cattily go over the pitfalls of relationships, including Rona's budding one with an Italian chef. Ruth (Gabrielle Rose) has lost communication with her teenage daughter, Rachel (Nadia Litz). An ophthalmologist (Pascale Bussieres) who is going deaf wants to re-experience comforting sounds before he completely loses his hearing.</p>
        <p>In a film that deals with urban alienation, ''all of its characters are out of touch and having a hard time communicating except on the shallowest levels'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. New Line. $106.99; DVD, $24.98. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Cecil B. Demented</p>
        <p>When did John Waters movies stop seeming so subversive and begin to feel so warm and fuzzy? In a swipe at Hollywood philistinism, a band of moviemaking revolutionaries kidnaps a star (Melanie Griffith) at the Baltimore premiere of her newest movie and forces her to appear in their own guerrilla production. Though constantly sharp and amusing in its choice of targets, the film ''lacks the manic edge of some of Mr. Waters's earlier movies'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 88 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
