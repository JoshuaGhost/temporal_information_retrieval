      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Gen Colin Powell's meeting with Pres Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Pres Joseph Kabila of Congo, two leading antagonists in conflict in Congo, sends welcome signal that new administration understands gravity of Africa's multiple crises and intends to play role in trying to solve them</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the weeks before he took office as secretary of state, Colin Powell made clear he was determined to devote American attention to the problems of Africa, a continent that was barely mentioned during George W. Bush's campaign. General Powell seems to be making good on that commitment. He met this week with two of the leading antagonists in one of Africa's most destructive and intractable wars, the conflict in Congo. His involvement sends a welcome signal that the new administration understands the gravity of Africa's multiple crises and intends to play a role in trying to solve them.</p>
        <p>General Powell met separately with the president of Rwanda, Gen. Paul Kagame, and with the newly installed president of Congo, Joseph Kabila.  The meeting with General Kagame was marked by a notable change in tone from that of the Clinton administration, which was insufficiently critical of the general for the widespread abuses committed by his troops and their rebel proxies. In contrast, General Powell urged the Rwandan to curb human rights abuses in the regions of eastern Congo occupied by Rwandan troops. This new approach should send a message that the Bush administration is prepared to treat all sides in Congo's conflict in an evenhanded manner.</p>

        <p>Congo's war has drawn in no fewer than five neighboring nations and devastated that vast country. Washington may now be in a better position to pressure Congo's belligerents to abide by their 1999  peace accord. That includes Mr. Kabila, who was installed in Kinshasa last week after his father, Laurent Kabila, was murdered. The real powers to be reckoned with in the areas of Congo under Kinshasa's nominal control are Mr. Kabila's main foreign backers, Angola and Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>The United States cannot end Africa's political and military conflicts, including the convulsions in Sudan, Sierra Leone, Angola and Burundi. But some creative diplomacy by General Powell can be constructive. His quick engagement with Congo is a promising start.</p>
