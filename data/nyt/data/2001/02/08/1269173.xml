        <p>IF the title had been scrawled in broom smoke across the sky, it could not have sent chillier shivers down my spine: ''The Surrendered Wife: A Practical Guide to Finding Intimacy, Passion and Peace With a Man.''</p>
        <p>In a flash, the book brought back what my mother -- a housewife with four children who never left the bedroom without a full face of makeup -- had preached in the 1970's. ''Let him handle everything -- just bite your tongue,'' she would instruct as I grabbed the car keys and dashed for the door ready to seize the next bull by the horns.</p>

        <p>IF the title had been scrawled in broom smoke across the sky, it could not have sent chillier shivers down my spine: ''The Surrendered Wife: A Practical Guide to Finding Intimacy, Passion and Peace With a Man.''</p>
        <p>In a flash, the book brought back what my mother -- a housewife with four children who never left the bedroom without a full face of makeup -- had preached in the 1970's. ''Let him handle everything -- just bite your tongue,'' she would instruct as I grabbed the car keys and dashed for the door ready to seize the next bull by the horns.</p>
        <p>''You liberated women are going to make men weak and then you won't want them,'' she warned. ''You'll be sorry!''</p>
        <p>Naturally, I ignored her. Now I'm wondering if she was simply ahead of her time.</p>
        <p>Just as George and Laura Bush usher in a new era in presidential partnerships, here's a new book championing female compliancy. A self-help title that doesn't stop at offering the standard bromides of inner peace and harmony, ''The Surrendered Wife'' (Fireside, $13) promises devotees more tangible rewards: free time, better sex and more ''expendable income.''</p>
        <p>The author is Laura Doyle, a former copy writer from Costa Mesa, Calif. Describing herself as a feminist (''and former shrew''), Ms. Doyle, 34, said she felt compelled to tell her Gen-X sisters, especially those ''driven to correct, criticize and conquer,'' that their domineering ways have rendered their husbands insecure, silent and resentful.</p>
        <p>Her suggested path back to marital bliss runs suspiciously close to the doormat. ''Instead of throwing out traditional roles, try them on again,'' Ms. Doyle exhorts in Chapter 13, called ''Abandon the Myth of Equality.''</p>
        <p>The gist is that if men feel they are in charge, their wives, freed from constant decision-making, will be happier, too. A how-to appendix spells out how wives should keep their ''surrendering'' a secret from their husbands and band together in circles to strengthen their resolve.</p>
        <p>It all sounds like 12 Steps to Stepford wifehood. But this 285-page manifesto has already landed its author on NBC's ''Today'' program. Since publication on Jan. 8, the publisher says, it has sold more than  100,000 copies and has inspired Surrender Circles around the country where women  gather to practice saying, ''Whatever you want, dear'' with a straight face. Oprah's people have called. The author's Web site, surrenderedwife.com, flogs three-hour seminars with Ms. Doyle, now scheduled in 28 cities ($59, including book). Toll-free phone consultations start at $30 for the first half-hour.</p>
        <p>''It's so easy,'' said Lenore Sierra, 40, an administrative assistant for a medical group outside Los Angeles, who said she once fit the textbook definition of the bossy wife.  ''I've spent thousands of dollars for books and tapes on relationships, and this was the first time it was easy to do everything she said'' -- things like not giving a husband advice while driving even if it means heading in the wrong direction. (Tales of  long detours appear often in testimonials by surrendered wives.)</p>
        <p>''I don't want my two sons saying 'Yes, wife, whatever you say, wife,' '' Ms. Sierra said. ''My children are going to see that this is what respect is about. And one day they're going to be king of their families with a good woman by their side.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Doyle believes that every decision, from vacations to child care, is an opportunity to make a husband feel more masculine and thus more eager to please. To get hubby to carry packages, a wife should marvel at how big and strong he is. ''This will feel odd  -- perhaps even dishonest -- at first,'' writes Ms. Doyle, who actually suggests that women practice covering their mouths with duct tape to curtail the urge to sass. And she believes that regardless of who's the breadwinner, husbands should control the finances, balance the checkbook and dispense a cash allowance. The rationale is that vulnerability leads to trust, a lesson all too familiar to kidnap victims.</p>
        <p>The surrendered wife provides sex on demand (a rather innocuous edict compared with a zestier suggestion in Marabel Morgan's 1973 work, ''The Total Woman,'' which urged wives to greet their husbands naked and wrapped in cellophane). Being available, Ms. Doyle temporizes, ''doesn't mean you don't have to ask for what you want first.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jean Baker Miller, a psychiatrist and director of training at the Wellesley Center for Women, at Wellesley College, said: ''These ideas periodically come back around in one form or another. The whole change in the image of women that we've been going through is incredibly complex. People react with simple answers. But this is one of the most simple that I've heard.''</p>
        <p>Then I took it up with the Moms, a floating group of at-home and working mothers who convene for morning coffee at a meat-district brasserie following school dropoff. The Moms know their way around everything from Jimmy Choo shoes to Multi-Sports packaged classes at the Chelsea Piers Sports Center. As I expected, they hooted over the book's title and its premise.</p>
        <p>But then the truth came out: they were experts at what could be called the high-impact minisurrender.</p>
        <p>''It's all old hat,'' said Gay Feldman, an owner of a photographers' and stylists' agency who helped her husband realize his dream of opening a French patisserie. ''Of course, he thinks he's in control. Of the little stuff.'' Ms. Feldman always asks her husband if he approves of her outfits.</p>
        <p>A lively discussion followed on the value and pleasure of letting husbands pour wine, open car doors and hold chairs.</p>
        <p>But control the purse strings? You must be kidding. Chantal Weinman, a group stalwart and mother of two, whose husband travels frequently, said she was relieved when he recently offered to take over paying the bills. ''One less hassle,'' she said. ''But it has put me on a different plane. I have to ask him if I have enough to do every little thing I want to do. I'm thinking of regaining my power over the bills.''</p>
        <p>When I mentioned the book to Katrina Yoder, a mother of two who is not afraid to tell her husband when to go through a green light, her face fell. ''I thought that the relief of marriage was that the games were all supposed to be done,'' she said. ''Haven't we evolved beyond high-school tricks?'' That said, she calls her husband at work every few days just to say thanks for letting her spend a few years at home with the kids -- a gesture Ms. Doyle would surely approve of.</p>
        <p>Maybe ''The Surrendered Wife'' had some pointers for me?</p>
        <p>I like to think my husband and I are on solid equal footing. In fact, it's so even-steven we practically keep score cards. I know that if I go out on the town with girlfriends, he's clocking the hours for when it's his turn. And if he goes grocery shopping and makes dinner, I'm in for a full week of dish washing. It's only fair.</p>
        <p>But on one point, I'm an incorrigible nag. I wondered how a surrendered wife would handle Who Has to Walk the Dog at Night.</p>
        <p>Usually, I take our Labrador out every morning while my husband does the rounds at night. He drags his feet; it drives me nuts. Ruggles just whines. ''It's really the dog he's letting down,'' Ms. Doyle said in a phone consultation. ''Let him suffer.'' (She meant the dog.)</p>
        <p>She recommended that every time my husband walks the dog I offer praise and thanks -- everything short of a biscuit.  ''Make a big deal about it -- go overboard,'' she said. ''He'll feel appreciated.''</p>
        <p>Behavior modification for husbands?</p>
        <p>Just do it, she said. ''In two weeks, you'll probably see a difference.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the instant I told my husband how ''nice'' it was that he had taken the dog around the block, he wanted to know what was up my sleeve.</p>
        <p>He has since taken to falling asleep before walk time, rendering him immune to the complaints of dog and wife alike.</p>
        <p>For a self-help book, ''The Surrendered Wife'' is not all that extreme. The basic principles -- giving a partner some space and the respect to follow his own best judgments -- seem sound to me. So does the reminder that there is little satisfaction in trying to control a man's preferences, whether for loud ties or line of work. This is Humanity 101. What grates is the calculatedly docile language as she counsels to ''say yes to sex'' and ''practice saying 'I can't.' ''</p>
        <p>And she advises readers not to tell their husbands they're even reading the book (Ms. Doyle never let on that she was writing a how-to book: her husband said he thought it was a Harlequin romance).</p>
        <p>All this petty deception and faked compliance do not seem worthy of two adults who have thrown their lots together with eyes and hearts open.</p>
        <p>Yet ''The Surrendered Wife'' has struck some kind of nerve. Mark Gompertz, a vice president and the publisher of Simon &amp; Schuster trade paperbacks, said he first resisted considering it for publication. After all, he's a 90's husband. ''I was trying to be the P.C. and sensitive man,'' he said. He wondered at the time, ''How can we even think to do this?'' Female colleagues convinced him otherwise.</p>
        <p>Now, he said, he's ''a complete convert.''</p>
        <p>''I've been leaving it around the house,'' he confessed. ''I'm hoping my wife will pick it up.''</p>
