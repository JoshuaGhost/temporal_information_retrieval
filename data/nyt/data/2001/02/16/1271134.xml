        <p>The French government announced plans today to slaughter up to 10,000 head of cattle a week to support beef prices forced down by the mad cow crisis.</p>
        <p>Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany called the step an emergency measure and said that beef untainted by the disease would be frozen. His chief of staff said the meat would be destroyed later, when incinerators are available. Now, France, like other European countries, has a surplus of frozen and pulverized cattle because of the crisis and is having problems dealing with it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glavany's comments seemed aimed to appease small ranchers who have been protesting around the country all week. On Wednesday, a group invaded a Rh√¥ne Valley slaughterhouse and burned imported beef from Argentina.</p>
        <p>The ranchers have demanded that the government pay them $140 to $500 for each head that they sell at low prices. The crisis has driven beef prices down by as much as 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glavany said he could not do that, citing European Union rules against subsidies. He did promise to take the ranchers' case to the next meeting of the European agriculture ministers, on Feb. 27 in Brussels.</p>
        <p>''If Brussels refuses to listen to the distress of French ranchers,'' the minister said, ''I will take up my responsibilities in accord with the prime minister, and we will then re-examine the situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glavany's chief of staff, Monique Saliou, said that before the crisis began two months ago Frenchmen ate 45,000 cows a week. Consumption is down to 35,000. The government can buy and burn 10,000 a week before it runs into an incinerator backlog.</p>
        <p>That should rather neatly take care of the surplus. But consumption dropped much lower than 35,000 in the early days of the crisis. That leaves a pool of 100,000 extra cows on farms, uneaten and unburned, but still depressing prices.</p>
        <p>The announcement today is an effort to shrink that pool. Those animals will be bought by the government, killed and frozen until the incinerator jams ease. France has enough frozen storage to handle 10,000 cows a week, Ms. Saliou said.</p>
