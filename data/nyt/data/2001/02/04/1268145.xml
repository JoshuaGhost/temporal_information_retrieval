        <p>THE Camden educational establishment may be reeling with the number of initiatives the new school superintendent has put on the table in her first month, but Annette D. Knox says this is just the beginning.</p>
        <p>There were several of what Ms. Knox considers priority items that received board approval last week.</p>
        <p>There is no consistency among schools in the lesson plans, books or subject matter being taught, a system that the school board president, Philip E. Freeman, calls ''districtwide anarchy.'' In a city where the mobility rate is high, this poses a particular problem to those children who move from school to school. Ms. Knox plans to use $719,000 in state funds for several skill development programs.</p>
        <p>Six schools will be reviewed for consolidation, including Challenge Square Academy with 21 pupils and South Camden Alternative with 51. Parents say the small settings are needed for the students, most of whom have had trouble with the law.</p>
        <p>Ms. Knox wants to establish a comprehensive summer school program that  would include literacy and math instruction for elementary students and selected courses for the middle and high schools. The program will cost $1 million.</p>
        <p>All students would be issued swipe ID cards to help track attendance and improve security.</p>
        <p>In addition, the board will send out a bid for proposals to privatize the schools' food service program, in the hope of identifying a less costly and more nutritional alternative. Under the proposal, current food workers will be given a chance to maintain their positions.</p>
        <p>To allay fears of those who find Ms. Knox too aggressive, the superintendent explained that her plans to clean up one of the state's most troubled school districts would take time. Realistically, she said, she expected that not every one of her proposals would sail through.</p>
        <p>''Nobody's perfect,'' she said. ''I'm going to make mistakes. Perhaps what I can't win today, we'll win later as we move through the process.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''People have always told me to slow down. It's true, it can't all be done overnight. But you'd like to see every kid get the benefit of what they need now.''</p>
