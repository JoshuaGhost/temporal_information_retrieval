      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Just a few years after D. W. Griffith made ''Birth of a Nation'' in 1915, the African-American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, a former coal miner and Pullman porter, started making films. In them, African-Americans are portrayed with dignity in roles of authority in contrast to the typical stock characters of the day. Micheaux's genres included drama, musicals and films about social themes, and he directed over 40 films between 1918 and 1948. On Saturday Feb. 10 at 2 p.m. the Newark Museum will screen, one of Micheaux's silent films, ''The Symbol of the Unconquered'' (1920). The drummer Max Roach will provide the percussive accompaniment to the film he performed once before on television. Pearl Bowser, co-author of a book about Micheaux published last fall, ''Writing Himself Into History: Oscar Micheaux, His Silent Films, and His Audience,'' (Rutgers University Press) will also be there to discuss Micheaux and sign copies of her book. In her book, Ms. Bowser wrote that ''The Symbol of the Unconquered'' reveals the economic underpinnings of the Ku Klux Klan. Michele Parchment, manager of public programs, who also coordinates the Newark Black Film Festival, said of Micheaux, ''He is one of our silent heroes when we are dealing with African-American history.''</p>
