        <p>Collected Works</p>
        <p>A Journal of Jazz, 1954-2000.</p>
        <p>By Whitney Balliett.</p>
        <p>St. Martin's, $40.</p>
        <p>Whitney Balliett is one of those rare critics whose prose can be as much a work of art as what they write about. The long-time jazz critic for The New Yorker and the author of 15 previous books, Balliett has issued a ''distillation'' of nearly 50 years of his impressionistic reporting and reviews in ''Collected Works: A Journal of Jazz, 1954-2000.''+Balliett is best in his short, sharp profiles -- those flashing glimpses of the unknowns, underrateds, near-forgottens or long dead. The pianist Ellis Larkins, the trumpeter Joe Thomas, the baritone saxophonist Serge Chaloff and the tap-dancer Baby Laurence are among many who receive brief but careful treatment. Pee Wee Russell gets an exemplary description: ''Thin and tallish, he has a parenthesis-like stoop, spidery fingers and a long, wry, gentle face governed by a generous, wandering nose. When he plays, this already striking facial arrangement, which is overlaid with an endless grille of wrinkles and furrows, becomes knotted into grimaces of pain, as if the music were pulling unbearably tight an inner drawstring.'' Balliett gives short shrift to avant-garde musicians who have stripped out, or made nearly imperceptible, the lifeblood of the hard-swinging, blues-infused music that only Balliett can bring so believably to life on paper.</p>
