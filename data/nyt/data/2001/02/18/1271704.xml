        <p>BUYING quality furniture requires looking carefully at construction details and evaluating the materials used.</p>
        <p>How can you tell what kind of material is in the chair that you are considering? Quality manufacturers usually provide a tag and some literature describing the materials and manufacturing processes used to make their products. A few dealers may have a cutaway of an actual chair that shows the frame and underpinnings of the piece. You can also ask the dealer questions about materials and construction techniques that are not described in the literature.</p>
        <p>Here are some things to look for:</p>
        <p>Furniture starts with a frame. In most cases the frame is constructed of wood. The framework in good-quality furniture is made from hardwoods like oak, alder, birch or maple. These woods are strong and resilient and their tight grain holds pegs, screws and nails securely in place for a long time. Framework made with softwoods, plywood, and particleboard does not hold up well.</p>
        <p>The raw wood should be dried in an industrial oven or kiln to remove excess moisture. Kiln-dried lumber is less likely to absorb moisture that could cause the frame to swell, shrink or change shape.</p>
        <p>A good wood frame is joined together with dowels and reinforced with wood blocks that are glued and screwed to the framing members. Joints and panels that are stapled or nailed in place indicate poor quality.</p>
        <p>Some parts of the frame, particularly the legs, may be carved. Today carving is done by machine, but often this is followed by hand touch-up work to create a slightly uneven quality that simulates a totally hand-carved look.</p>
        <p>Some manufacturers resort to molded wood compositions to imitate real carving. Faux carvings are easy to recognize because they have a textured surface without any wood grain. These appliqu√© carvings are not part of the wood and are glued in place. Over time, the glue can loosen and the carving will separate from the frame.</p>
        <p>After the frame is finished, the upholstery is added. Bands of webbing, made of tough woven fabric about four inches wide, are stretched across the bottom of the frame and tacked in place. Quality seat construction uses coil springs tied onto the webbing with strong twine. The springs are tied in eight ways -- front and back, on both sides, and on the four diagonals. This eight-way tie holds the springs securely so they can resist and support heavy loads.</p>
        <p>Some manufacturers may use S-shaped springs -- steel wires bent to resemble a series of sinuous waves -- in place of coil springs in their furniture seats. These springs are cheaper than coil springs and they take less time to install, but they only support up and down pressures and are not as comfortable as a coil-spring seat. They have their uses, however; even quality manufactures use the S-shaped springs in the backs of chairs and sofas because the springs are flat and have a thinner profile.</p>
        <p>Another type of spring is the arch spring. This is a flat band of metal curved into a closed loop. These springs are a fairly recent innovation in furniture manufacture. They do, however, provide a firm, resilient and comfortable seat that can last as long as the coil-spring seat.</p>
        <p>Padding is placed on top of the springs and frame to provide a soft surface and conceal the feel of the springs and wood framing.</p>
        <p>Thick layers of urethane foam provide the best padding. Natural animal fibers, like horse hair or pig's hair, are also good, but they should be rubberized -- dipped in rubber -- to eliminate fiber splitting and odors. Plant fibers, like moss, kapok and cotton, are functional but less durable than either foam or animal fiber. The least desirable padding is made with excelsior, which is nothing more than wood shavings.</p>
        <p>Upholstery fabric is an important consideration because it is the most visible part of the furniture. Wool is the most widely used natural fiber. It is long-wearing but it should be mothproofed and professionally cleaned. Linen is also used as an upholstery fabric. It takes dye well and resists fading, but it stains and soils easily and wears quickly.</p>
        <p>There are a number of synthetic fibers, like nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester, used to make upholstery fabric. Generally, they are stronger and more durable than natural fibers, but they fade faster in sunlight and some synthetics generate static electricity when you slide across them.</p>
        <p>Leather is the most durable covering, provided it is at least one-sixteenth-inch thick. In addition it is easy to clean. Synthetic coverings, like Koroseal and Naugahyde, simulate the look of leather, but they are easily torn and can become brittle with age.</p>
