        <p>THE PALACE OF TEARS</p>
        <p>By Alev Lytle Croutier.</p>
        <p>Delacorte, $19.95.</p>
        <p>In ''The Palace of Tears,'' Alev Lytle Croutier sets out to create a quasi-historical fable that weaves together the 19th-century worlds of the Ottoman Empire and the Second Empire of France. Croutier, who is a Turkish expatriate, has written before about the longstanding attraction between East and West: her book ''Harem: The World Behind the Veil'' was a fascinating history of the harem and of Western perceptions of Eastern exoticism. In this short novel, however, which starts in 1868, Croutier lapses into overblown Orientalist fantasy. Her protagonist, Casimir de Chteauneuf, is a bored French winemaker who comes upon a miniature portrait of a turbaned woman in a Paris shop and falls headlong in love with her likeness. His quest to find the woman who modeled for the painting proves fruitless until the Empress Eugenie de Montijo (wife of Napoleon III) invites him to join her entourage on a fateful voyage to Constantinople. Croutier's idea of taking actual historic characters and intruding her Zelig-like hero into their midst is an amusing one. As she warns us in her epigraph, ''This is a work of fiction. . . . Do not believe a word of it.'' But this promising sense of playfulness soon runs aground in florid and derivative writing. (The pining Casimir, for example, has eyes ''burning like a tiger's in the night.'') Though Croutier's tale has its lyrical moments, it too often resorts to such cliches. ''The Palace of Tears'' is larded with explicit and implicit references to other books, including a scene of a lovers' tryst in a carriage that reads like a pastiche of a scene from ''Madame Bovary.'' Despite the author's repeated efforts to evoke the spirit of ''One Thousand and One Nights,'' this is one magic carpet that does not fly.</p>
