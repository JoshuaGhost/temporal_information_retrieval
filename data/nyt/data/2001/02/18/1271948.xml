        <p>Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur shook his stick in frustration as he skated from the ice and shuffled along a carpeted hallway toward the locker room with more than a period left in the game.</p>
        <p>His movements were tense and stunted, any anger not a show for others, but a response to the fate and the ill health that has been dealt the Devils.</p>
        <p>Brodeur gave up four goals on 18 shots in the Devils' 5-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres tonight. He was yanked in the second period and replaced by Chris Terreri after Sabres right wing Maksim Afinogenov made the score 4-1.</p>
        <p>The Devils, who were already beset with injuries, added right wing Petr Sykora and center Scott Gomez to their injury list tonight.</p>
        <p>It was the fourth time this season the usually steady Brodeur had been removed from a game. On two occasions it was because of injury, and once, on Oct. 19 against Washington, because he surrendered four goals on 11 shots.</p>
        <p>But Brodeur was not upset at being pulled. He was genuinely relieved.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of happy,'' said Brodeur. ''In a game like that, you might as well get some rest.''</p>
        <p>Coach Larry Robinson said: ''The way we were playing in front, we weren't helping him. We were trying to make fancy plays. And when 70 percent of your skill players are out, you can't play that way. We should be playing simple, but we were out there looking like a bunch of Mario Lemieuxs.''</p>
        <p>It was difficult for the Devils, who have not won in six straight games and have won only 2 of their past 11, to play through their collective pain at HSBC Arena against the Sabres. They have lost to Buffalo in all three meetings this season and have been outscored, 14-3.</p>
        <p>''It was not a fun game to be in,'' Brodeur said. ''We made a lot of mistakes. And, we lost two more players. It's amazing, because it's a long season, and at some point you feel it's going to happen to you, but to get hit this hard is tough. But we've got to win with the guys we have.''</p>
        <p>The game had a lethargic, choppy feel to it, which was not surprising considering the Devils' injury list.</p>
        <p>Sykora left the game with a bruised shoulder. Gomez, who was hit in the back of the head with a puck in Friday's 4-4 tie against Pittsburgh, left early with a sore back.</p>
        <p>This came after he had spent several hours in the hospital Friday night after being hit by a slap shot from teammate Colin White. The puck hit below Gomez's helmet, on his upper neck. Neurological tests were negative.</p>
        <p>It was the Devils who would get the first break tonight. It was one of just two things that would go their way.</p>
        <p>Buffalo's Miroslav Satan appeared to have scored at 4 minutes 23 seconds of the opening period. But after a video review of the play, officials disallowed the goal because Satan had shoved the puck into the net with his hand.</p>
        <p>Then, Devils right wing Pierre Dagenais, who was called up from Albany of the American Hockey League on Friday night, scored his first National Hockey League goal on the power play at 10:25 of the first period to give the Devils a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The scoring play developed when White corralled the puck at the blue line and made a perfect pass to left wing Patrik Elias. He shuffled it to Dagenais, who poked it past the veteran Dominik Hasek.</p>
        <p>''I knew he was in net but I didn't think about him,'' the soft-spoken Dagenais said. ''I just shot the puck and, hey, it went it.''</p>
        <p>But Satan would get his goal, as well as a second one, and he made Devils defenseman Brian Rafalski look foolish on both occasions.</p>
        <p>In the first case, the Sabres were shorthanded and Satan stripped the puck from Rafalski at center ice and skated toward Brodeur. His slap shot from close range tied the game 1-1 at 18:30. Satan scored again at 10:38 of the second period when Afinogenov intercepted a pass by the fumbling Rafalski and fired a wrist shot past Brodeur to make it 3-1. The Sabres' Rob Ray had given Buffalo a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>The Devils were also without center Jason Arnott, who sustained back spasms Friday; center Bobby Holik, who missed his second consecutive game with a sore knee; and defenseman Scott Niedermayer, who missed his fifth game following arthroscopic knee surgery. Earlier today, right wing Alexander Mogilny, the team's leading goal scorer with 31, was placed on injured reserve retroactive to Feb. 8, which was when he sustained an abdominal strain at Ottawa in practice.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating and weird so many injuries are happening all at once,'' Arnott said. ''I'm just glad it's now and not during the playoffs, or just before.''</p>
