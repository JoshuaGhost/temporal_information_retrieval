        <p>NONE of its characters are Hispanic; in fact, they're not even human. But that hasn't stopped ''The Simpsons'' -- or in this case ''Los Simpsons'' -- from becoming the most popular English-language show on television among the almost nine million Hispanic households in the United States.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean ''The Simpsons'' is the most popular television program for Hispanic Americans. Far from it. The list of popular shows in Hispanic households, according to a report compiled by the media-buying firm TN Media, is dominated by one network: Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast network. According to the report, the top 16 shows in Hispanic households are all on Univision, headed by ''Laberintos de Pasión,'' (''Mazes of Passion'') one of many soap opera-style shows on the list.</p>

        <p>That doesn't mean ''The Simpsons'' is the most popular television program for Hispanic Americans. Far from it. The list of popular shows in Hispanic households, according to a report compiled by the media-buying firm TN Media, is dominated by one network: Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast network. According to the report, the top 16 shows in Hispanic households are all on Univision, headed by ''Laberintos de Pasión,'' (''Mazes of Passion'') one of many soap opera-style shows on the list.</p>
        <p>But among English-language programs, Fox's ''The Simpsons'' is the favorite, with a 9 rating among Hispanic households. (Each rating point represents 890,000 homes.) While some TV shows are available to Spanish-speaking viewers in an instant translation version, ''The Simpsons'' is not, a Fox executive said, because the show is delivered too close to its broadcast date to be dubbed. (Translated episodes of ''Simpsons'' are widely available in syndication, however.)</p>
        <p>''The Simpsons'' is part of a clear preference in Hispanic homes for shows from the Fox network. Of the 20 top-rated English-language programs in Hispanic homes, 10 are on Fox, according to the TN Media report, which is based on information provided by Nielsen Media research. Among them are ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' ''Dark Angel,'' ''That's 70's Show'' and ''The X-Files.'' Yet no Fox show turns up on the top-20 lists for white households (No. 1 is NBC's ''ER'') or for black households (ABC's ''Monday Night Football'').</p>
        <p>According to Stacey Lynn Koerner, the vice president of broadcast media research for TN Media, the reason Fox dominates the Hispanic list has nothing to do with cultural preferences and everything to do with age. ''The Fox network is a youth-oriented network,'' she said, ''and Hispanic Americans are very young.''</p>
        <p>The median age of television viewers in Hispanic households is 28.8, far younger than the median age of 36.9 in the total national survey. And Hispanic viewers are getting younger: last year their median age was 31.2.</p>
        <p>Ms. Koerner noted that about half of Hispanic homes have Spanish as the dominant language. ''But in those homes the younger viewers speak more English,'' he said. ''It follows that a network with shows aimed at younger viewers would have the most popular shows.''</p>
