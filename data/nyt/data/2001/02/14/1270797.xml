        <p>Nickelodeon network is creating new, Sunday night block of programs for children between ages of 9 and 14 who are outgrowing its children's programming and may be lured away to MTV (S)</p>

        <p>Almost since its inception, Nickelodeon, the No. 1 children's network, has faced a problem inherent to its programming.</p>
        <p>At some point, children do not want to be children anymore. They begin striving for young adulthood. In television terms, it means they begin trading in the cute, cross-pollinated cat-dog character of Nickelodeon's animated ''CatDog'' program for the real-life boy bands and girl bands of MTV's ''T.R.L.'' (Until they become what are called ''grown-ups'' and find themselves watching the ''CatDogs'' of the world once again, if only to recapture innocence lost.)</p>

        <p>Almost since its inception, Nickelodeon, the No. 1 children's network, has faced a problem inherent to its programming.</p>
        <p>At some point, children do not want to be children anymore. They begin striving for young adulthood. In television terms, it means they begin trading in the cute, cross-pollinated cat-dog character of Nickelodeon's animated ''CatDog'' program for the real-life boy bands and girl bands of MTV's ''T.R.L.'' (Until they become what are called ''grown-ups'' and find themselves watching the ''CatDogs'' of the world once again, if only to recapture innocence lost.)</p>
        <p>To combat that built-in audience erosion, Nickelodeon is creating a new, Sunday night block of programs for tweens, defined as those between the ages of 9 and 14 who sooner or later become defectors.</p>
        <p>The idea is to give children of those ages a reason to think it is still cool to watch Nickelodeon, executives said. The block will be shown from 6 to 8:30 p.m. and will include programs like ''Taina,'' the live action high school-based sitcom, and ''Caitlin's Way,'' an action-adventure series based on the exploits of an orphaned teenage girl. To raise the hip quotient, the pop star Macy Gray will sing the new theme song for ''As Told by Ginger.'' The block will also include music videos and first-person testimonials by everyday children and will be branded ''TEENick.''</p>
        <p>''We've carved out one piece of the weekend that we can call a home base for tweens,'' said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president and general manager. ''This is based on this whole notion that they have one foot in the world of kids and one foot ready to be in the world of teens, and they're teetering in the middle, depending on where they are developmentally.''</p>
        <p>She said that the block was a result of research that showed that the number of children between 9 and 14 in Nickelodeon's overall audience had grown considerably in recent years.</p>
        <p>Most of the programs that will fill the block will be familiar ones. But there will be one new program, ''Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,'' which was previously shown on Friday nights on ABC.</p>
        <p>The programming block will make its debut on March 4. ''Hanging with Mr. Cooper,'' however, will not join the lineup until March 18.</p>
