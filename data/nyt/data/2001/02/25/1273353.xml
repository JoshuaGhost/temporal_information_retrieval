        <p>IF R. J. Best, the standout skier of the North Salem High combined team, were a train, he would be a runaway express.</p>
        <p>If he were a basketball player, he would lead the fast break.</p>
        <p>If he were a boxer, he would go for a knockout on every punch.</p>
        <p>Best doesn't ski a course, he attacks it.</p>
        <p>''He's a brute on the course,'' North Salem's coach, Steve Smith, said. ''He generates awesome power. He just explodes out of the starting gate. Often on the hill below, when he's coming over, he's carrying so much speed that someone will say, 'Wow, who was that?'</p>
        <p>'' 'R. J.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Oh. Figures.' ''</p>
        <p>Best will be one of the favorites in the state high school skiing championships on Bristol Mountain in Canandaigua Tuesday and Wednesday. At the recent Section I championship, he won the men's skimeister award for the second straight year while sweeping the slalom and giant slalom. In the slalom, the object is to get down a 300-yard hill with a 600-yard drop as quickly as possible while going inside or outside planted poles, or gates, in a sort of obstacle course. You can hit a pole as long as both skis pass it on the proper side.</p>
        <p>''R. J. really cuts it tight, bending the poles,'' Smith said. ''The way he skis, you get the feeling that if the poles were trees, they still would bend.''</p>
        <p>Nothing has slowed Best since he put on wooden slats at the age of 2 and entered his first competition at 8. ''Never a serious injury but lots of falls that hurt,'' said Best, a muscular 6-foot-1, 175-pounder. ''I loved skiing from the beginning: going fast, the competition, being out there on the mountain.''</p>
        <p>And going for broke?</p>
        <p>''I think it's something I acquired with experience. You learn to go for it.</p>
        <p>''Actually,'' Best said, ''I took it easy on the second runs in the sectionals. After a good, fast run, I didn't want to fall.''</p>
        <p>Best's lone loss in North Salem's 8-1 season came when he missed a gate. Together he and his cousin Bill Greenwood, both students at John Jay High School, have led North Salem combined all season.</p>
        <p>Both are seniors. Their mothers are sisters. ''We've been skiing together since we were 2,'' Greenwood, the more compact and more disciplined of the two, said. ''Everywhere. One year we both went to ski camp in France. It was awesome. The mountains there are huge,'' he said, referring to the Alps.</p>
        <p>Greenwood finished second to his cousin in both events at the sectionals. ''I don't expect to beat R. J.,'' he said. ''He's a more serious racer. I have more fun doing jumps and the half pike.''</p>
        <p>Both their fathers are coaches at the Okemo Mountain School in Vermont. Best still competes there on weekends and went to school in Vermont for three years before transferring back to John Jay for his final two years of high school.</p>
        <p>''My coach in Vermont, Lori McCallum, she's made me the skier I am,'' said Best, who was on the United States Junior Olympics team. ''I've trained with her for four years.''</p>
        <p>Now he is back in a more modest level of competition.</p>
        <p>''This is a different type of racing,'' he said. ''The overall competition and racing isn't the same as at a ski academy, but the top skiers are very competitive.  And at Okemo, it's more an individual thing. Here it's more group-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Best fits into the group. Mike Lefferts, a North Salem eighth grader with promise, knows firsthand. ''R. J. is incredible, the way he stays on his edges and makes incredible turns,'' Lefferts said. ''But he takes the time to tell me how to get better.''</p>
        <p>The North Salem girls' team, which finished 7-2, has a standout in Morgan Govan, who is also going to the state championships after finishing second to Carmel's Christine Anderson in the sectionals.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes top skiers are prima donnas,'' Smith said. ''Not R. J., Bill and Morgan. They're special.</p>
        <p>''On the bus to a recent practice, the guys left their gear strewn all around, so I gave them my ultimate punishment: They had to walk up the mountain for their first run.</p>
        <p>''R. J. hadn't dropped anything but he said, 'O.K., Coach,' and started climbing with his teammates.''</p>
        <p>Best has climbed a lot of mountains and put his initials on a lot of leader boards. So what does the R. J. stand for?</p>
        <p>''Robert Jackson Best the third,'' he said. ''But from the beginning my family called me R. J.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps they sensed that having a third at the finish just wouldn't be appropriate.</p>
