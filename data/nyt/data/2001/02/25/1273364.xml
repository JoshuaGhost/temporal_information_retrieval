        <p>LAST summer, during the Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick Lazio, it was hardly unusual for Westchester women to get together to dish about Mrs. Clinton and debate whether she would make an effective senator.</p>
        <p>But as it turns out, several such discussions were examined closely by the Clinton campaign and even discussed in detail by President and Mrs. Clinton in the White House.</p>
        <p>A book out this month, ''Hillary's Turn'' (Free Press, $25) by Michael Tomasky, a columnist for New York magazine, reports that the Clinton campaign organized four focus groups in Westchester in mid-June when the campaign was at a tactical crossroads. It then used observations from the groups to make decisions about how to portray Mrs. Clinton, choosing to focus on issues rather than her image.</p>
        <p>Although there was no shortage of strong opinions about Mrs. Clinton, her strategists seemed most interested in the views of Westchester women, Mr. Tomasky wrote. White suburban women represented a voting bloc that the campaign considered crucial to victory.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton eventually defeated Mr. Lazio, outpolling him among women by 20 points. But back in early June, polls showed voters split evenly between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio. Mrs. Clinton's campaign was especially troubled that, although she led Mr. Lazio among female voters, 49 to 38 percent, she trailed among white women, 46 to 41 percent.</p>
        <p>For months campaign workers sought a solution to ''Hillary's woman problem.'' According to Mr. Tomasky's book, ''There was a tremendous suburban animus against Hillary, one that was somewhat mysterious.''</p>
        <p>To get to the bottom of the problem, the book reports, the campaign ran a series of two-hour interview sessions, each with 10 local women.</p>
        <p>The groups, the book reports, were ''designed to probe the dark question of Hillary's candidacy,'' which was: why did suburban women in particular ''seem to detest her?''</p>
        <p>''The campaign knew about women's anger toward Hillary, but the groups showed that there were layers to it they never quite fathomed,'' Mr. Tomasky said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''There was anger in their voices. They saw her as cold and unfeminine and wanted to see a more human, vulnerable side. The campaign found it valuable to hear those things and it helped in positioning Hillary.''</p>
        <p>The sessions, two held on June 21 and two on June 23, were taped, and Mr. Tomasky said he was given copies of the tapes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton herself never actually heard the tapes, Mr. Tomasky reports, adding: ''This was, if not for the campaign then at least for her ego, a very good thing.'' In free-spirited discussions, the book reports, many women criticized Mrs. Clinton for being ''threatening and unwomanly'' and ''ruthless and greedy for power.''</p>
        <p>One woman called her ''very controlling''; another called her ''self-serving.''</p>
        <p>''We really don't know who Hillary Clinton is,'' said another woman. Yet another added that, if she were Hillary, she would ''put a bullet to my head or start drinking.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton long maintained that she was a ''Rorschach test'' for women and their changing role in society. If that was the case, the groups were none too enthusiastic about those changes.</p>
        <p>''Intelligence and strength became, as these women saw them in Hillary, negative qualities,'' Mr. Tomasky writes.</p>
        <p>When each woman was told to write down several words to describe Mrs. Clinton, the list included cunning, cold, savvy, pushy, ruthless and back stabbing. Several women blamed her for not taking a stronger stand against her husband's infidelity.</p>
        <p>''She thinks like a man,'' one woman said, and others echoed another woman's statement, ''She doesn't represent me as a woman.''</p>
        <p>At one point, the women were shown a television commercial calling Mrs. Clinton ''a candidate who comes on strong,'' which seemed to hit a nerve with the women who ''like humble women and women who made sacrifices,'' the book reports.</p>
        <p>Shira Nayman, a psychologist who ran the groups, said in an interview that the groups started out as ''touchy-feely discussions,'' but became more lively when participants were shown videotapes of Mrs. Clinton speaking.</p>
        <p>''They were jumping out of their seats,'' said Ms. Nayman, who ran the sessions like a talk show host. ''She was a lightning rod for all these incredibly intense emotions. It was really intriguing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nayman's company, Strategic Frameworking, a Seattle-based company that specializes in brand marketing strategy, was hired to run the focus groups. They were conducted at Fieldwork New York at Westchester, a focus group center in Elmsford. The women sat around a long table, observed by campaign staffers, who sat behind a one-way window.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nayman said she called Westchester women who fit certain criteria and offered them a fee to attend.</p>
        <p>''We were looking for women who were pro-Hillary, anti-Hillary and neutral, all sides of the spectrum,'' she said. ''Women either loved her or hated her, or both at the same time, and we wanted to see why they were so polarized.''</p>
        <p>Dwight Jewson, one of Ms. Nayman's partners, added: ''I was surprised at the depth of the anger, not so much at her as a person as at the role she played.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised the women were buying into the stereotype that if you're a strong woman, you're either a mother figure or a manipulative opportunist. The core to her success with suburban women came from understanding the depth of that.''</p>
        <p>Before the focus groups, there was disagreement in the campaign over whether advertisements should address voters' distrust of Mrs. Clinton. Should the campaign gamble and deal with Mrs. Clinton's personality, or just stick with her stances on the issues?</p>
        <p>One strategist was Ellis Verdi, whose firm, the Devito Verdi advertising agency in Manhattan, favored confronting the negatives by creating advertisemements to deflate the notion that Mrs. Clinton was an opportunistic carpetbagger.</p>
        <p>''We thought it would be a tremendous advantage if we had self-deprecating ads, that she would become more familiar and more approachable to voters,'' he said. ''If you take three or four issues she was being attacked for and bring them up, you're essentially winking at them and disarming the attacks on her.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tomasky said the focus groups convinced the campaign that the personality issue ''was just too big a mountain to move.''</p>
        <p>''Based on my interviews,'' he said, ''they looked at it and decided the best course was to stick to the issues and hope that people would put her personality aside and just see her as a potentially good advocate for certain causes and issues that she emphasized.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jewson said he went to the White House to discuss his findings with the Clintons. Mr. Clinton ''grasped immediately the implications of what the groups showed,'' he said, namely that they could not run a ''personality contest.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Jewson said, the campaign decided to help voters warm up to Mrs. Clinton's personality by ''using the issues as a link to her identity.''</p>
