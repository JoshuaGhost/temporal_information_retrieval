        <p>A boy who neighbors said had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair  was killed early yesterday when a fire broke out in his apartment in  New Lots, Brooklyn, the police said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Kevin Carter, 11, was in his bedroom on the fifth floor of 570 Stanley Avenue around 1:30 a.m. when the fire, caused by faulty wiring in a lamp in the room, broke out, said Joseph Leoncavallo, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>It took firefighters about 30 minutes to bring the fire under control. Kevin was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>His grandmother, Dorothy Blumfield, 56; his twin sister, Kenia Carter, who neighbors said also has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair; and another relative, Robert Blumfield, 54, who lives in the apartment, were taken to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center and treated for smoke inhalation, said Jean-Claude Francisque, a hospital spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumfield was admitted in stable condition, and Kenia and Ms. Blumfield were released.</p>
        <p>Neighbors at the Linden Houses project said that despite signs on their doors that say what to do in the event of a fire, they could not get past the heat and smoke.</p>
        <p>''I panicked,'' said Rosalind Marshall, who lives across the hall. ''We couldn't open the door. It was too hot, too black. It was terrible. I was scared to death.'' She said she just stuffed towels under her door and prayed.</p>
        <p>Yvette Grandos, 34, who lives on the same floor, said that she was awakened by the sound of children crying and went into the hallway.</p>
        <p>But she said that the smoke was too thick to see and that her husband pulled her back into the apartment.</p>
        <p>Even after the fire was out, Ms. Grandos said, she could not go back to sleep. ''I could still hear the children's screams,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors said that they saw emergency medical workers carry the twins out of the building: Kenia on a stretcher, and Kevin in a small body bag.</p>
        <p>Many said that they saw the children's mother, Patricia Melton, who was not home when the fire started, run to the ambulance and collapse in grief, crying, ''My babies, my babies.''</p>
        <p>When the fire broke out, Ms. Melton, who neighbors said is a manager for Sears at the Kings Plaza shopping mall and also works as a hairdresser, was in a nearby building styling a friend's hair, neighbors said.</p>
        <p>Gail Hilton, a friend of Ms. Melton's and the godmother of her oldest daughter, Keyatta Benjamin, said that Ms. Melton was devastated by the fire. Ms. Hilton said that at Kings County Medical Center, where Kevin was taken to the morgue, Ms. Melton kept saying: ''My son is still in there. My son's all right.''</p>
