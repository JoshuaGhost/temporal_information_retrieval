        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: NEW RAT PANEL URGED -- A City Council committee looking into the increase in the rat population is to recommend today that City Hall establish a permanent rat-control authority, supervised by the Department of Health. The authority would replace a year-old task force that a Council study says has been ineffective. ''This administration ends in a few months, and we could just go back to ignoring the problem,'' said Bill Perkins, above, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Council's Select Committee on Pest Control, which is to release its study at a hearing today. Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota, who heads the mayor's task force, would not comment.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: OFFICERS HIT BY CAR -- Two police officers changing a flat tire on Queens Boulevard were struck by a car turning onto the boulevard yesterday, the police said. Both officers suffered minor injuries and were treated at Jamaica Hospital, said Sgt. William Stiles, a police spokesman. The victims, Capt. James Albrecht, who was held overnight, and Officer Rafael Garayua, who was released, were changing the tire at the corner of Queens Boulevard and Main Street at 5:22 p.m. when the other car struck them while turning from Main Street, Sergeant Stiles said. No charges were filed, he added. Queens Boulevard is one of the city's most dangerous streets and has been the subject of recent police crackdowns against speeders.</p>

        <p>HAUPPAUGE: GASOLINE STUDY SOUGHT -- Two Suffolk County lawmakers said yesterday that they planned to introduce legislation to study the health risks and costs of a potentially dangerous gasoline additive leaking into ground water. The legislation, to be introduced next week, would authorize spending up to $85,000 for a law firm to outline any health risks, determine the cost of a cleanup and identify anyone responsible for allowing the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., into the ground water. Cameron Alden, a Republican, wrote the bill with Maxine S. Postal, a Democrat and the legislature's deputy presiding officer.</p>

        <p>SYRACUSE: HOSPITAL FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY -- Officials at Crouse Hospital, the largest in Syracuse, said this week that the hospital had filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws. Officials said the hospital, with 566 beds and more than 2,000 employees, had $90 million in long-term debt and owed vendors more than $20 million. In the last two years, the hospital has lost more than $21 million.</p>

        <p>UTICA: RAILROAD LAWSUIT -- A class-action lawsuit against Amtrak and CSX Transportation contends that the railroads were negligent in a Feb. 5 accident that injured 61 people. The lawsuit was filed last week in Federal District Court for 15 of the injured passengers. It seeks $75,000 per passenger from the two railroads, said one of the lawyers, Peter Catalano. Officials at Amtrak and CSX would not comment on the suit.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: SUPPORT FOR CELL-PHONE BILL -- An overwhelming majority of voters say they support a bill in the state legislature to ban drivers from using hand-held cell phones. The Quinnipiac University poll, released yesterday, found that 85 percent of respondents favored the measure, and 14 percent opposed it. More than a third of cell-phone users polled said they either sometimes or frequently used cell phones while driving. Taken Feb. 14 to 19, the poll surveyed nearly 1,300 registered voters.</p>

        <p>WATERBURY: BUDGET CUTS FOR CITY -- Facing a state takeover of the city's finances, Mayor Philip A. Giordano has told department heads to cut their 2001-02 budget requests by 10 percent and to propose layoffs if needed. A memo issued Wednesday by Thomas Ariola, the budget director, detailed budget demands that he said could require staff and service cuts. Mayor Giordano said the reductions could total $25 million, which he said would eradicate the city's $17.8 million deficit from the 1999-2000 fiscal year and reduce this year's deficit by $7.2 million.</p>

        <p>NEW BRUNSWICK: RUTGERS MAGAZINE SUED -- A Rutgers University publication is defending itself against charges that it discriminated against a group that wanted to publish an advertisement critical of Rutgers's athletic program. Rutgers Magazine's editorial director testified at a hearing on Wednesday that the magazine did not publish the 1998 ad on behalf of the Rutgers Advisory Council 1000, a group that wants the school to spend less money on sports and more on academics, because the ad violated the magazine's policy against issue-oriented ads.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: YOUTH ACCUSED OF MAKING BOMB -- A Bogota High School student was trying to build a bomb in his room, Bergen County officials said Wednesday. The unidentified 17-year-old, a special-education student, was being held yesterday on weapons and explosives charges. William H. Schmidt, a prosecutor, said the youth had hidden a metal can with kerosene and a wick, nails wrapped in duct tape, black powder, two large  bottles of butane and two pieces of pipe. Charges were filed after he told classmates that he had materials to make a bomb at home, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: N.J. TRANSIT SETS BUDGET -- New Jersey Transit has approved a $1.13 billion capital projects plan for the fiscal year 2002, a 23 percent increase over last year. Under the plan, approved Wednesday by the agency's board of directors, it will spend $20 million on new trains and $15.3 million on new buses. It also budgets more than $200 million for repairs, reconstruction and maintenance on existing equipment.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: SENTENCE IN SCHOOL BEATING -- A 15-year-old student at Cherry Hill High School who pleaded guilty to helping beat a classmate unconscious was given two years' probation and ordered to write a letter of apology, prosecutors said Wednesday. Judge Louis F. Hornstine of State Superior Court in Camden sentenced the student, Rashan Taylor, who was also given a two-year suspended sentence. His victim was  kicked in the head, chest, arms and back, the prosecution said.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES -- A Passaic County sheriff's officer was indicted yesterday on federal civil rights charges that he beat one Democratic campaign worker and threatened to kill another on Election Day 1999, the United States attorney's office announced. The indictment of the officer, George E. Rosario, follows complaints of voter intimidation by sheriff's officers. The indictment charges that Mr. Rosario, a Republican, punched one victim and threatened to kill a second because they were putting up Democratic campaign signs. Mr. Rosario's lawyer, George L. Schneider, said that his client, 30, was off duty and in civilian clothes and that the scuffle was minor.</p>
