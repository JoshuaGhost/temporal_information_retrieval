        <p>Three weeks before turning 50, Leslie Ayvazian was on vacation in Greece with her family.

        <p>Three weeks before turning 50, Leslie Ayvazian was on vacation in Greece with her family. The temperature was 112 degrees and the air-conditioner in their hotel room was broken, so they all went to the pool where, importuned by her 11-year-old son, she climbed to the high dive and became paralyzed with fear, unable to jump off. Evidently what went through her mind up there was her life.</p>
        <p>This, in any event, is the conceit that Ms. Ayvazian, a playwright (''Nine Armenians'') and actress, has seized upon for her one-woman show, ''High Dive,'' which opened yesterday at the MCC Theater. It's a presentation that does what theater people often do with the self-dramatizing impulses that bring them to their profession in the first place, namely, call attention to themselves in the hope of showing themselves off as special. And though Ms. Ayvazian hasn't had a terribly eventful life, she is mildly successful here; by coloring her self-aggrandizement with generally self-deprecatory wit, she presents herself as a passive Everywoman who gets involved in awkward situation after awkward situation, to wit: jumping off the high dive, or crossing a rope bridge over a river in the French Alps ''because I imagine that I am, perhaps without my knowing it, a person who would like to do that.''</p>
        <p>Much of her rumination has to do with traveling, which, in accordance with the predilections of her Armenian ancestors, she doesn't like to do. Her husband does, however, and accompanying him on his globetrotting she finds herself in the midst of record heat waves, cold snaps or natural disasters: ''Our vacation scrapbooks begin with pictures of newspapers with headlines that read: 'Red Cross Arrives,' 'Airports Closed,' 'Curfew in Effect.' ''</p>
        <p>We also get an accounting of her employment history, which includes working for Vista, becoming the first female cable television installer in Columbus, Ohio, and being the props and costumes mistress of a dinner theater where the guest stars had a tendency to make odd requests. One, unnamed ''because she's still alive and a sweet person,'' insisted that Ms. Ayvazian flush her toilet; another, Dorothy Lamour, had Ms. Ayvazian remove her brassiere after a show: ''I went from her back to her knees. And it had 63 hooks.''</p>
        <p>She also tells a beastly story about acting with Mickey Rooney -- he's the beast -- and in the show's funniest anecdote recalls how a drunken Peter Lawford ruined her appearance as a contestant on a television game show.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ayvazian, a tall, attractive woman with cascading dark hair, performs on a mostly bare stage that is tiled in dark blue to suggest the bottom of a pool; there's a platform in the center to suggest the high dive, which she ascends, accompanied by projections on the back wall of an azure sky, when the narrative returns to the present in Greece. Otherwise, she strides about casually, gesturing with her graceful arms and hands and employing the enthusiastic diction of an overactive party host. Occasionally, you'd like to look over her shoulder to see who else is around; the subtext of many of the jokes made at her own expense is ''Aren't I funny?'' And some of her vacation stories have the quality of social one-upmanship. ''Oh, that's nothing, wait till you hear what happened to me.''</p>
        <p>But over all she is a welcoming performer, and her delivery is carefully calibrated to an audience-engaging pitch. The show involves the audience as well. In the half-hour before she goes on Ms. Ayvazian cruises the lobby, giving out script pages and ''casting'' theatergoers willing to deliver lines from their seats. There are 34 people involved, no small percentage of the audience in a 120-seat house, and though it's a risky gimmick -- Ms. Ayvazian acknowledges this at the start -- it works; the interruptions are brisk and often funny, helpfully shaking up the rhythm of the show and giving Ms. Ayvazian a chance to react as an actor. Maybe she won't get so lucky every night, but at least at the performance I saw each and every participant was right on point and right on cue.</p>
