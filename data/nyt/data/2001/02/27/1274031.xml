        <p>In its first food-safety regulation, the Bush White House has approved a proposal, made in the waning days of the Clinton administration, that would require testing for potentially lethal Listeria bacteria in factories that process ready-to-eat meats.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups have pressed for such testing since 1998, when 21 people died from eating hot dogs and deli meats contaminated with the bacteria. Some advocates, however, complain that the new standards are not strict enough, even as they give high marks to Agriculture Secretary Ann M.

        <p>In its first food-safety regulation, the Bush White House has approved a proposal, made in the waning days of the Clinton administration, that would require testing for potentially lethal Listeria bacteria in factories that process ready-to-eat meats.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups have pressed for such testing since 1998, when 21 people died from eating hot dogs and deli meats contaminated with the bacteria. Some advocates, however, complain that the new standards are not strict enough, even as they give high marks to Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman for winning approval of the proposal, one of scores of last-minute regulatory steps by President Bill Clinton that President Bush froze in his first days in office.</p>
        <p>Carol Tucker Foreman, director of the Food Policy Institute of the Consumer Federation of America, said Secretary Veneman had asked the White House for an exception to that freeze. A spokesman at the Agriculture Department said Ms. Veneman was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Food-borne bacteria like Salmonella, E. coli and Listeria, common in raw food, are killed by cooking.  Ready-to-eat products like salami, turkey breast, liverwurst or even hot dogs, however, are eaten directly from the refrigerator, where, unlike other disease-causing bacteria, Listeria can grow.</p>
        <p>The new rule, which will now be subject to public comment for 90 days before adoption, does not differ markedly from the one made by the Clinton administration. It would require large plants to test four times a month for Listeria on those surfaces  that come into contact with ready-to-eat meats. A positive result would require that food products be tested for Listeria monocytogenes, an environmental contaminant that can easily enter food, and any contaminated product would have to be destroyed.</p>
        <p>Listeria monocytogenes does not pose much danger to most healthy people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems. But it does present a serious threat to the elderly, to pregnant women and to people with weakened immune systems. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable, as are their unborn children; even a mild infection may cause miscarriage, stillbirth or life-threatening illness for a newborn.</p>
        <p>The death rate among all those infected is about 20 percent. In an outbreak that started last December, almost 17 million pounds of Cargill-brand turkey, ham and other ready-to-eat products was recalled. The contamination resulted in three miscarriages and four deaths.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups had wanted more testing than the new rule would require, and had urged that ready-to-eat meats carry mandatory warning labels for high-risk consumers and that the packaging list an expiration date. ''The proposed testing is less than what many plants are doing today,'' said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.  ''More tests would save more lives by helping the industry to quickly identify and correct gaps in their food safety program.''</p>
        <p>Some industry groups were also displeased with the administration's decision. The American Meat Institute, which represents packers and processors of meat and poultry, said that ''it is inappropriate to sample some foods known to support the growth'' of Listeria monocytogenes, but not to sample other such foods. The rule applies only to ready-to-eat products regulated by the Department of Agriculture, not to cheeses or ready-to-eat seafood like smoked fish, which are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
