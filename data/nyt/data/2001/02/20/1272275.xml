        <p>Bill Moormann called home this morning, just before he and his friends would begin the 16-hour drive back to New Jersey. His 11-year-old daughter, Michelle, had been waiting for his call.</p>
        <p>She told her father she had written a poem Sunday night in the memory of Dale Earnhardt, the hard-driving stock car driver who was killed on the final lap of the Daytona 500 earlier in the day. Michelle read the poem to him.</p>
        <p>Bill Moormann and his friends then knew they had to postpone the trip for a few hours. He asked his daughter to repeat the poem, so he could write it down. They went to a drugstore at 8:30 a.m. and bought a big sheet of white poster board.</p>
        <p>Then they scrawled Michelle's poem on it in black ink. Two lines of Michelle's poem read: ''He died doing what he liked best. Now is time for our hero to rest.''</p>
        <p>Moormann and his buddies found a spot on a railing around a fountain outside the Daytona USA museum at Daytona International Speedway, which fans had established early this morning as a memorial to Earnhardt. Jim Balaz, his friend, hung up the sign with black tape, then stood there in silence with hundreds of others ringed around the shrine. ''We had to come back here,'' Moormann said.</p>
        <p>As sea gulls reclaimed the infield at Daytona International Speedway, pecking at the hundreds of trash bags, a traffic jam formed on what usually is a quiet morning after the Daytona 500.</p>
        <p>Beginning at sunrise, thousands of fans came to the racetrack, bringing flowers, Earnhardt hats, posters and signs. Many dressed in Earnhardt T-shirts. Some brought camcorders. Others brought cameras. En route to the impromptu shrine, a man told a woman to pause and snap a photo of the grassy banking outside the Turn 4 wall. ''That's where he died,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nascar fans were also making pilgrimages today in Mooresville, N.C., and Welcome, N.C., to pay tribute to Earnhardt. In Mooresville, site of Earnhardt's business empire, fans left their weathered black No. 3 baseball caps in front of buildings. Heather Higgins McCarter, 26, came to pay her respects to a driver and friend who, 10 years earlier, after having won a race at Darlington, saw her and said, ''Happy birthday, this victory's for you.''</p>
        <p>In Welcome, a small town just south of Winston Salem, fans placed flowers and candles at the shop of Richard Childress, the owner, who was Earnhardt's close friend and business partner for many years.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt, 49, a native of Kannapolis, N.C., who made more than $41 million in his career, was a titan in this sport. Racing fans thought it fitting, even mandatory, that they should make a pilgrimage to the racetrack to remember him.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt souvenirs, always plentiful at a Nascar Winston Cup race, were almost impossible to find around Daytona Beach. A copy of the Daytona Beach News-Journal, the local newspaper, was fetching $5 per copy. The flags at the speedway, dropped to half-staff after Earnhardt's death was announced at 7 p.m. on Sunday, stayed there.</p>
        <p>Someone hung a cardboard windshield screen with Earnhardt's photo on the fountain railing. Fans sauntered by, silently, and wrote short memories of Earnhardt on it. When that was full, someone hung up another sheet of poster board. Three sheets were full by noon.</p>
        <p>''Life won't be the same,'' one message read.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't your biggest fan, but I respect the man. God bless you,'' another read.</p>
        <p>When Moormann was finished, he planned to drive back to Beachwood, N.J., near Toms River. He drives a street-stock at Wall Stadium in New Jersey, where, he said with a smile, he has a aggressive reputation at the local racetrack that is a little like Earnhardt's.</p>
        <p>Moormann, who had been an Earnhardt fan for at least 15 years, was still shaken 18 hours after the driver's death. Moormann still believed the Nascar Winston Cup cars should drive on, without interruption.</p>
        <p>''In this sport, there are so many things that can go wrong, and that's the sort of thrill that keeps everybody coming back,'' he said. ''But this was like a wake-up call.''</p>
        <p>Sandy Koester and her two sons had driven 45 minutes from Tavares, Fla., this morning. She works at AAA Signs, but her boss had given her the morning off. The company had made a sign in memory of Earnhardt. It had a black cross on it with the No. 3, the number of Earnhardt's car, in the middle.</p>
        <p>She was determined to hang it somewhere at the racetrack. She found a spot on the railing at the shrine. ''He was our guy,'' she said. ''I just said I was coming here whether there was anything here or not.''</p>
        <p>As she stood there, her sons looked at their sign. She had brought along a camera to take photos for her co-workers at AAA Signs. ''I've seen wrecks before,'' she said. ''He hit the wall too hard.''</p>
        <p>Her sons, Victor, 15, and Steven, 13, were asked if Nascar should take a week off, perhaps Sunday's race at Rockingham, N.C. Victor and Steven shook their heads.</p>
        <p>''They've got to keep going,'' Steven said.</p>
        <p>''I think Dale would have wanted them to keep racing,'' Victor said.</p>
        <p>The Koesters backed away from the railing to let others take a turn. A woman walked up to the Earnhardt shrine, kneeled and said a prayer. A family formed a circle, clutched hands and prayed. A boy in the prayer circle sneaked a peek back at the shrine. They left, and someone else quickly took their place.</p>
