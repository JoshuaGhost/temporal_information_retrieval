        <p>Backstage at the Mayflower Dog Show, the overwrought yuppie dog owner Hamilton Swan exhorts his neurotic Weimaraner, Beatrice: ''You see a blue ribbon. Grab it! Get it!'' When her attention wanders, he shouts: ''Look at me! Don't look at those loser dogs. Look at me!''</p>
        <p>But Beatrice fails to stay within herself -- perhaps it was the upsetting loss of her bumblebee squeaky toy -- during the competition. She jumps a judge and is disqualified. ''Still a champion even though she was sent off in disgrace,'' says the know-nothing TV commentator Buck Laughlin. ''Like Shoeless Joe Jackson.''</p>

        <p>Backstage at the Mayflower Dog Show, the overwrought yuppie dog owner Hamilton Swan exhorts his neurotic Weimaraner, Beatrice: ''You see a blue ribbon. Grab it! Get it!'' When her attention wanders, he shouts: ''Look at me! Don't look at those loser dogs. Look at me!''</p>
        <p>But Beatrice fails to stay within herself -- perhaps it was the upsetting loss of her bumblebee squeaky toy -- during the competition. She jumps a judge and is disqualified. ''Still a champion even though she was sent off in disgrace,'' says the know-nothing TV commentator Buck Laughlin. ''Like Shoeless Joe Jackson.''</p>
        <p>The scenes are from ''Best in Show,'' this past fall's documentary spoof by the writer-director Christopher Guest. Thanks to Guest's comedy, canine aficionados can be forgiven if they have equally vivid memories of Winky (or Ch. Thank You Neil Sedaka), the Norwich terrier who won the Mayflower, as they do of Samantha (or Ch. Salilyn 'N Erin's Shameless), the English springer spaniel voted top dog at last year's Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.</p>
        <p>At the 2001 Westminster Show, which begins today at Madison Square Garden, the leading dog in the country, a bichon fris√© named Ch. Special Times Just Right! (or J. R.), will not be shown by a co-owner with two left feet -- as Winky's was -- and the top-ranked boxer, Ch. Storybook's Rip It Up (or Jake), does not have an owner from Pinenut, N.C., who knows every nut known to man.</p>
        <p>Yet Guest's skewed reality is a notable one for players in the sport of dogs.</p>
        <p>Like it or not, Guest successfully conveyed the intensity of owners and handlers -- even if he focused on the eccentric fringe -- and recreated the look of a show like Westminster.</p>
        <p>The actors who played the judges were appropriately serious, deliberating seemingly forever. Those who showed the dogs looked credible, trotting in rhythm beside their dogs.</p>
        <p>''It's a spoof of something very dear to our hearts,'' said Anne Clark, who has shown three poodles to best-in-show titles at Westminster. ''I had a lot of trepidation going in to see it, because every time you're put under a microscope, you can cringe.''</p>
        <p>Her review: ''It wasn't deplorable.''</p>
        <p>But William F. Stifel, a former president of the American Kennel Club who is now a member of the Westminster club's board, said: ''I don't know why, but I expected to be torn apart. But it took a very kindly view. I recognized a lot of the people in the movie.''</p>
        <p>Earlene Luke, who trained Guest, Eugene Levy, Scott Donlan and Jane Lynch to portray handlers, said that while she never witnessed a panic to match the loss of Beatrice's squeaky toy, she saw terror when handlers lost the ''bait,'' or treats, like liver, sausages or Oreo cookies that are given to the dogs as rewards as they are being shown.</p>
        <p>''I've heard them say, 'Where's the bait! Where's the bait!' '' she said. ''Or sometimes, if they're in a hurry, you'll hear, 'Where's my comb!?!' ''</p>
        <p>Guest was inspired to make the movie when he took his two dogs to exercise at a dog park. His conversations with the owners of purebred dogs led him to explore the dog-show world.</p>
        <p>He spent part of a day at the 1999 Westminster Show, touring the judging rings and the backstage benching area where the dogs await their turns in the limelight.</p>
        <p>''He was looking for a feeling, to get the flow of what happens,'' said Tom Bradley, the show's spokesman, who led Guest around the Garden's floor. ''He was very unobtrusive. He wanted to know what goes on, from the sublime to the ridiculous. He did it very well.''</p>
        <p>But count Joe Garagiola among the aggrieved. Garagiola calls the dog show for the USA network, playing the role of the amused outsider to the expert commentator, David Frei. In the film, his role was recreated as Buck Laughlin (played by Fred Willard).</p>
        <p>''I didn't think it was funny,'' Garagiola said. ''To compare what he said to what I say is apples and oranges.''</p>
        <p>In the film, Laughlin wonders why a bloodhound does not wear a Sherlock Holmes hat and smoke a pipe, and how miniature schnauzers are miniaturized. He asks his British expert commentator ''if money ever gets exchanged under the table,'' and at one point remarks, in amazement, ''To think, that in some countries, people eat these dogs.''</p>
        <p>Garagiola was especially puzzled when Laughlin turns to his partner to ask, ''How much weight do you think I can bench press?''</p>
        <p>''Is that funny?'' Garagiola said. ''I think the satire went way over the top. Fred took it so far away. I said, 'Oh, oh, this guy is playing me.' But when the movie was over, I said to my wife, 'It got rave reviews. What was I missing?' ''</p>
        <p>Maybe Garagiola noticed that the dogs emerged with more dignity than the people in ''Best in Show.'' It was not Winky's fault that her owners, Gerald and Cookie Fleck, did not have enough money, or a valid credit card, to pay for a hotel room to attend the Mayflower Show and had to stay in a utility closet. But the little terrier maintained his equanimity.</p>
        <p>''Some people are very sensitive,'' said Matthew Stander, an editor at Dog News. ''They don't have any perspective.''</p>
