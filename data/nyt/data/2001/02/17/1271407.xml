        <p>THE mini-movement to get Bill Clinton to run for mayor seems to have lost all its steam, not that it had much to begin with. Can't imagine why, begging his pardon.</p>
        <p>So that leaves New York Democrats with the same four mayoral wannabes who have been around all along, though the number could grow should the Rev. Al Sharpton  grace us with his candidacy. Thursday night provided a chance to see the present cast of characters all in a row, sort of a political equivalent to the preview of fall fashions offered this week at Bryant Park.</p>
        <p>The setting was the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, in the old B. Altman building at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. The host was the Professional Staff Congress, the university's faculty union.</p>
        <p>In alphabetical order -- a system that comes naturally to professorial types -- the candidates strutted their stuff. They were, in case you don't have the names straight yet, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president; Mark Green, the public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller; and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker.</p>
        <p>If ever there was an audience primed for a Democratic Restoration at City Hall, this was it.</p>
        <p>For many at CUNY, Rudolph W. Giuliani is Ivan the Terrible, Attila the Hun and Vlad the Impaler, only less charming. They feel he has scapegoated them for too long, calling professors lazy, administrators incompetent and students half a notch short of dumb. Not surprisingly, few among the 150 or so who gathered in the Graduate Center's auditorium were about to bathe the Republican mayor in love.</p>
        <p>The mood was set by the union's president, Barbara Bowen, who called for ''a revolution in thought at the mayor's office.'' It was time, she said, to replace ''the present regime of slander,'' to end the city's ''calculated disinvestment'' in CUNY, to reshape what had become a ''politicized board of trustees'' under Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>It was, in short, a perfect arena and a perfect issue for the Democrats to pound away at Giuliani policies, free of worry that they might be seen as soft on crime or high on taxes or low on moral fiber or anything else deemed toxic in the prevailing political climate.</p>
        <p>Pound away they did. Some of them even showed off before the crowd, using a vocabulary worthy of the SAT's but not destined for street campaigning, words and phrases like ''paradigm,'' ''remunerative,'' ''sine qua non'' and ''Augean stables.''</p>
        <p>THE consensus was that Mr. Giuliani has failed New York schools, CUNY campuses included. They needed less bashing from the mayor's office and more fiscal and moral support, though no one was prepared to commit to specific dollar amounts, not in an economy that may be going wobbly.</p>
        <p>Even at this pupa stage of the campaign, the candidates showed clearly differing styles in how they plan to deal with the inescapable shadow cast by the present steward of City Hall.</p>
        <p>Messrs. Hevesi and Vallone, the more right-leaning Democrats, criticized Mr. Giuliani but in language not remotely inflammatory. Messrs. Ferrer and Green, tilting left, did not flinch from testing verbal bombs for possibly permanent slots in their arsenals.</p>
        <p>''I'm not Rudy Lite,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''I'm not a kinder, gentler Rudy, or Rudy with a smile.'' As for Mr. Green, no one had to scratch his head over whom he had in mind when he denounced ''government by tantrum, government by vendetta, government by enemies list.''</p>
        <p>Those lines were well received. But unintentionally, some in the audience demonstrated why Mr. Giuliani has found it easy, and politically profitable, to accuse CUNY of embracing mediocrity.</p>
        <p>Alone among the candidates, Mr. Hevesi urged the faculty to hold students to higher standards. His appeal drew hisses. The comptroller, who once taught political science at Queens College, then suggested that professors volunteer to teach a few more hours a week -- not many, just a few. More hisses. When he said he would love to restore CUNY to its tuition-free status of long ago, but asked which municipal services people would want to cut to help pay for it, some cried, ''Raise taxes.''</p>
        <p>You think maybe this was a crowd not fully in sync with the popular mood?</p>
        <p>Still, it was a politically sophisticated group. What does it say about the dynamism of this race that the auditorium was less than half full? Sure, the election is nearly nine months away. But you knew that Bill Clinton would have filled the house.</p>
