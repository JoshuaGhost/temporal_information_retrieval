        <p>Seven weeks after city officials ousted about 60 people from illegally converted lofts in a Brooklyn factory building because of fire safety hazards, most of the residents were allowed to return yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Department of Buildings declared 17 of the 20 lofts at 247 Water Street, near the Manhattan Bridge, ready to be reoccupied. People started moving back soon afterward.</p>
        <p>Although the lofts remain illegal under the building's industrial zoning, the buildings agency said that repairs made by the landlord, Joshua Gutman, removed most of the safety violations. Additional repairs will soon enable the last three lofts to reopen, the agency said. The State Assembly's Housing Committee held a hearing Thursday about legalizing such loft buildings. Among the solutions that have been proposed are rezoning and an expansion of the loft law to allow legalization of buildings illegally converted after 1980.</p>
