        <p>Like many professors at Baruch College, Cynthia Whittaker was skeptical that the college's enormous new building would be ready when the semester began. ''I'll bring you a bottle of Champagne if it is,'' she e-mailed Ned Regan, Baruch's president, two weeks ago.</p>

        <p>The college's new $319 million building, which curves toward the top, replaces two leased buildings</p>

        <p>Like many professors at Baruch College, Cynthia Whittaker was skeptical that the college's enormous new building would be ready when the semester began. ''I'll bring you a bottle of Champagne if it is,'' she e-mailed Ned Regan, Baruch's president, two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as students scrambled to find their classes tucked away in the building's 17 stories -- three of them below ground -- she delivered a magnum of Taittinger.</p>
        <p>''I was delighted to say I was wrong,'' said Dr. Whittaker, the chairwoman of the history department.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that the nearly 800,000-square-foot building, described as a vertical campus, is finished. As the first of Baruch's 16,000 students began surging in shortly after 7 a.m., they had to walk past construction areas marked off with yellow warning tape.</p>
        <p>They had to make do without operational computer labs. They had to cross the street for coffee (the food court was not ready) and walk past bare walls still waiting for art.</p>
        <p>But as students leaned over the railings, looked up at the soaring atriums and glanced around their gleaming new classrooms, all that seemed not to matter. After all, it is not often that colleges transform their campuses so strikingly.</p>
        <p>Baruch's $319 million building, squat at its brick base then curving inward in glass and aluminum above that, rises over Lexington Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets in Manhattan, occupying almost the entire square block. It is not only a prominent new embellishment to the Manhattan landscape; it is an important statement about Baruch. In recent years, it has become one of the most sought-after of the City University of New York's 17 undergraduate campuses.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to say anything negative,'' Michael Duldner, a sophomore accounting major from Flushing, Queens, said in a proprietary, protective way, as if someone might take away his new toy. ''The other buildings we were in were garbage. The elevators took forever, and you got stuck in them.''</p>
        <p>Albert Vega, a third-year student from the Bronx studying entrepreneurship and management, was also pleased. ''I don't feel like I'm in Baruch anymore,'' he said. ''The other buildings were gloomy. This feels much more advanced, more futuristic. Now you feel like you are in a really good school.''</p>
        <p>Probably the biggest single topic of conversation yesterday was the elevators. William Pedersen of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the architects for the building, said the main challenge had been how to move as many as 3,000 students between classes at a time.</p>
        <p>Most office buildings are not built for such huge, unceasing traffic flows. In some of Baruch's old buildings, the line for the elevators sometimes flooded out of the buildings and snaked around the block, as students waited 15 or 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>The new building has six roomy elevators side by side -- nicknamed the six-pack -- each holding up to 45 people. To speed their operation, the elevators open on both ends and stop only at every third floor. (Riders are expected to take escalators or use the stairs to get to the floors in between or take the slower, smaller elevators farther away from the classrooms that stop at each floor.) Yesterday, riders rarely had to wait more than a few minutes.</p>
        <p>The building, which replaces two leased buildings, is organized around a series of stacked atriums that are meant to substitute for traditional college quadrangles, providing space for students and faculty members to mix.</p>
        <p>Each ''quad'' anchors a program central to the college -- the Zicklin School of Business, the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences, and the Executive Education Program. (The school of public affairs remains in a separate building.)</p>
        <p>The specs are colossal, as if Baruch officials were afraid they might not get another chance and tried to stuff everything into one building. It includes 102 classrooms, 14 research labs, 36 computer labs, more than 500 offices, 2 auditoriums, a food court, a bookstore, a pool and a basketball court. It will house about half of the campus.</p>
        <p>Matthew Goldstein, chancellor of the City University of New York, set the building in motion in 1994, when as Baruch's president he told Gov. George E. Pataki that it was crazy for Baruch to continue to spend $22 million a year in rent.</p>
        <p>''The governor said, 'Let's do it,' '' Dr. Goldstein said yesterday, adding that the new building ''is all that I had hoped it would be.''</p>
        <p>Some professors expressed frustration that they did not have markers for the new dry-erase boards and that some of the new classrooms were not ready yet. But there was much they did like.</p>
        <p>''I had all I could do not to jump up and down when I saw the new technology in the classrooms,'' said Roslyn Bernstein, a professor of English.</p>
        <p>Dr. Whittaker, the history professor, said what she liked best ''is that now we have a building worthy of our students.''</p>
        <p>''They're all trying to fulfill the American dream,'' she said. ''Finally we have a building where they can do it.''</p>
