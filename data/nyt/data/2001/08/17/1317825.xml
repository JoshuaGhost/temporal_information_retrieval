        <p>The 2002 governor's race in Illinois is shaping up as a free-for-all, complete with the possibility of party-sundering primaries and a bitter debate over whether Illinois is ready for two Daleys, one to run Chicago and the other to run the state.</p>
        <p>The incumbent governor, George Ryan, a Republican, has declined to seek a second term because of political fallout from a corruption investigation, and the office he occupies, one of the most sought-after statehouse jobs in the country, will be open and fair game for all.</p>
        <p>At least a dozen hopefuls -- three Republicans and nine Democrats --  have jumped into the contest or are talking about it. The latest Democrat is former Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley, brother of Chicago's current mayor, Richard M. Daley, and son of that city's legendary mayor, Richard J. Daley.</p>
        <p>''Bill Daley's emergence as a possible contender in this contest has turned what was already a good fight into a real donnybrook,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan publication that follows and analyzes developments in national and state politics. ''No telling where this one is headed, not at this point, not with the Daley factor at play and the seat being open and so many people wanting it.''</p>
        <p>At least one private Democratic poll shows that Mr. Daley would have a good shot at winning the Democratic primary in March, particularly since none of the eight other possible contenders is as well known and the vote might very well be badly fractured if the field remains crowded. In fact, the political profiles of the eight, by and large, are so modest, particularly statewide, that detractors, some of them Democrats, refer to them as ''the eight dwarfs.''</p>
        <p>Of those eight, three are well-known enough that they might be able to give Mr. Daley a fair run for his political money: Representative Rod R. Blagojevich, who hails from Chicago's Fifth Congressional District on the North Side and already has $3 million in campaign contributions; former Attorney General Roland Burris, who is black and has a base of support among Chicago blacks; and Paul Vallas, a well-regarded former superintendent of Chicago's schools.</p>
        <p>Will the Democratic field narrow or will there be a divisive struggle down to the wire?</p>
        <p>''Too early to say,'' said Steve Brown, the spokesman for the Democratic Party of Illinois. ''Lot of high hopes out there.''</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Daley, if he becomes the Democratic nominee, could go on to defeat the Republican nominee -- most likely to be Attorney General Jim Ryan (no relation to the governor) or Lt. Gov. Corinne Wood -- is but a guess this far away from November 2002.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Ryan nor Ms. Wood can match Mr. Daley's high political profile, just as his possible Democratic competitors cannot.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a Chicago Sun-Times poll found this week that residents of the Chicago area were about evenly divided over whether having one Daley running the city and another running the state would concentrate too much power within one family or, put another way, within one political dynasty.</p>
        <p>There are other issues in the contest, including education, health care, transportation and, of course, governmental corruption. But for the moment, the biggest issue is Daley.</p>
        <p>Many of the state's top Democrats, having failed earlier to recruit a big-name candidate for the race, see the Daley name as a plus rather than a minus and are strongly urging Mr. Daley to jump in, arguing that the moment is right for him to strike and promising to help with campaign manpower and fund-raising. They make the point that while Democrats and Republicans fairly evenly share political control in Illinois, Democrats, who have not elected a governor since 1972, have a special opportunity in 2002 because the seat is open.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley has been telling friends that public service still has a draw on him and that within the next few weeks he will decide whether to run. He is currently an investment banker with Evercore Partners of New York; before that, after leaving his cabinet post in the Clinton administration, he ran Al Gore's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Daley's name was added to the list of possible contenders, the biggest question hanging over the contest was whether Governor Ryan would run again. Although he had not been accused of any wrongdoing in the corruption investigation, which was focused on a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred while he was secretary of state, the fallout from it all but buried him politically.</p>
        <p>With polls showing that two of every three voters did not want him to run again, he announced last week that he would not.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders in the state say Attorney General Ryan appears to be the current leader in their party's primary contest. They note that at least one independent poll found him ahead of the two other Republican hopefuls, as well as all Democratic hopefuls. However, the poll was taken before Mr. Daley indicated interest in running.</p>
        <p>''It's a long way to next March's primary, so there's no guarantee that Jim can hold that edge,'' said Richard S. Williamson, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party. ''We expect, as they say, a spirited fight.''</p>
        <p>Governor Ryan indicated when he pulled out of the race that he favored Lieutenant Governor Wood as his party's nominee, saying she would make an ''excellent'' governor while Attorney General Ryan would be a ''good'' governor.</p>
        <p>But on Aug. 8, at a Republican gathering at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, he seemed to pull back a bit, saying, ''The last thing we need is a divisive primary.''</p>
