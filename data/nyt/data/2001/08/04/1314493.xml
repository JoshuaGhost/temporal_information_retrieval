        <p>A federal district judge in Washington has ruled that Iran should pay  $314.6 million to the family of the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic radicals for nearly 19 months in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>In a decision issued late Thursday, the judge, Royce C. Lamberth, said Father Jenco and his six brothers and sisters had suffered because of ''the depraved and uncivilized conduct of the Islamic Republic of Iran.'' Judge Lamberth said Iran financed and controlled Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group that kidnapped Father Jenco.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A federal district judge in Washington has ruled that Iran should pay  $314.6 million to the family of the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic radicals for nearly 19 months in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>In a decision issued late Thursday, the judge, Royce C. Lamberth, said Father Jenco and his six brothers and sisters had suffered because of ''the depraved and uncivilized conduct of the Islamic Republic of Iran.'' Judge Lamberth said Iran financed and controlled Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group that kidnapped Father Jenco.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed by the estate of Father Jenco, who died of cancer in Illinois in 1996, and by his siblings.</p>
        <p>The decision was similar to rulings in other cases in recent years holding Iran liable for kidnappings and killings. But Judge Lamberth rejected a novel claim made by the Jenco family that had drawn attention to the case. The family's lawyers argued that because Father Jenco was a Catholic priest, and therefore did not have children of his own, his 22 nieces and nephews should be counted as children for the purpose of computing damages. Had the judge agreed, the damages could have been millions of dollars more.</p>
        <p>Of the $314.6 million awarded, $300 million was for punitive damages, $14.6 million compensatory damages for emotional distress and physical harm. American law has generally limited to members of the immediate family any awards for emotional distress. But the Jenco lawyers asserted that in the case of a priest from a large, close-knit family,  nieces and nephews were ''alter-ego children.''</p>
        <p>Judge Lamberth acknowledged that the kidnapping had had a ''tremendous impact'' on the nieces and nephews. But he said he was obliged to follow precedent, because of concern that open-ended definitions of people who can recover damages could overwhelm the courts. ''Some lines must be drawn,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Jenco family lawyer, Steven R. Perles, said that the family was disappointed with this part of the ruling but that there was no decision yet on whether to appeal it.</p>
        <p>Iran never responded to the suit. Under a federal law passed last year dealing with Iran and other countries deemed sponsors of terrorism, the Treasury is to pay a part of court judgments to victims of terrorism and charge those payments against a fund of impounded assets.</p>
