        <p>GREGORY PASCAL is climbing the steps to the roof terrace of a Harlem apartment building that he has renovated handsomely. It has a Spanish-style courtyard with cobblestones, tall cast iron gates, blooming flowers and trees.</p>
        <p>It is a day unlike any other day in Harlem. Helicopters are clamoring overhead. A celebration is going on. William Jefferson Clinton has arrived to open an office, and a crowd of 2,000 is welcoming the ex-leader of the free world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal, a 57-year-old developer, is eager to join in. But for the moment, he is leaning over the edge of the roof, trying to point out Mr. Clinton's new office four blocks south. He can't quite see it. Still, from the rooftop on West 129th Street, the changes in Harlem are apparent enough on this festive Monday. And Mr. Pascal has had a hand in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal, a lanky man with a quiet manner, is a recent addition to the real estate establishment in Harlem. Yet this outsider has become one of the leading entrepreneurs with contracts with the city to develop housing in the neighborhood. On the roof, he sweeps out an arm toward the shell of a decrepit building on the right, then to a peach-colored building on the left. ''That's me,'' he says proudly. He has 24 buildings on five blocks.</p>
        <p>''What we are trying to do is to take dead things and bring them back to life,'' says Mr. Pascal. ''We're doing things that Harlem needs right now.''</p>
        <p>He hasn't stopped there, though.</p>
        <p>He sees himself as something of a social engineer. He has created friction with some Harlem residents by bringing in a broader mix of tenants -- middle class, black and white, foreign as well as local. In his view, it's good to mix things up.</p>
        <p>''No one living in Harlem should be scared of people coming into Harlem,'' he says. ''They should be proud of someone coming in to live where you live, to learn about you. People can learn from each other.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal thinks heavy concentrations of poor blacks are bad for business, his business, of course, but also bad for the poor. He can tell you a thing or two about poverty. He was born in Venezuela to West Indian parents and grew up so hungry that he used to eat pigeons. He says they make a fine stew. (Perhaps not the New York ones, though.)</p>
        <p>His story is that of the immigrant striver. At age 25, he came to America, picked oranges in Florida and apples in Michigan, drove a cab, worked as a security guard. He even cleaned the floors of Citibank on Park Avenue. Just the other day, he signed a $20 million financing agreement with Citibank to rehabilitate Harlem buildings.</p>
        <p>Only in America. ''You can be anything you want to be,'' says the developer, who became a United States citizen one year ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal says his buildings are recognizable by little touches: greenery skirting the building, Christmas lights in trees for the holiday season, softly piped-in music in the public areas.</p>
        <p>''These places don't have to be a jail,'' he says.</p>
        <p>His renovated apartment complex at 38-44 West 129th Street is the jewel of the block. In the courtyard, he strides over to a tree in the garden. He plans to shear the treetop flat, letting it grow sideways like some Venezuelan trees.</p>
        <p>As he talks excitedly, his voice has the lilt of a West Indian. Yet when he answers his cell phone, he tears into Spanish with Hispanic contractors. (He learned English while attending school in the West Indies, but spoke Spanish at home in Venezuela.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal also manages property in the Bronx, where he has lived alone in the Belmont neighborhood since separating from his wife six years ago. He appeared on the Harlem development scene in 1997 through a city program that gives minority entrepreneurs its derelict buildings to renovate, manage and own. The city requires him to allow those who lived in his buildings to return after renovations, and to reserve 75 percent of the apartments for low-income tenants for 15 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal's actions have angered residents. He has relocated hundreds of tenants during renovations, placing some in unpleasant conditions, telling mothers that children selling drugs had to go. He is unapologetic. ''In this world, sometimes you have to give up something temporarily to gain a step or two. Some of the same people who complained are today the same people who say thank you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal has also irritated residents with his no-excuses policy of how they should live. As he walks by one building on West 129th Street, he stops beside a teenager sitting on a stoop. ''May I help you, miss?'' he says curtly. The girl answers gruffly, ''I live here.'' He replies, ''But we don't allow people to sit on the stoop.'' The girl storms off.</p>
        <p>AS he moves on, the girl's mother angrily trails after him, complaining that other tenants sit on the stoop. Mr. Pascal is firm. ''You should be ahead of them. You know better. You should be proud of where you live. Make a change.'' The mother calms down, but vows to take the matter to the next tenant board meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pascal keeps walking, passing boarded-up brownstones, Dumpsters piled with the remains of gutted-out buildings. ''That's mine,'' he says repeatedly. He has big plans. He thinks Harlem residents should think big, too.</p>
        <p>As he nears the rally for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Pascal says he is struck that it took a former president to affirm the community's revitalization. No one needed to convince him.</p>
        <p>He stands on the fringes of the crowd. ''It's a good day,'' he says, nodding his head. But he doesn't stay long. He has work to do.</p>
