        <p>Kleenex and the TNT cable television network are out to convince consumers that a box of tissues may be as essential as a bowl of popcorn when sitting down to watch a movie.</p>
        <p>In an unusual promotion aimed at women ages 18 to 49, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the maker of Kleenex, and TNT, part of the Turner Broadcasting System division of AOL Time Warner, are collaborating to capitalize on the impulse to use tissues to wipe away tears of joy or sadness while watching films.</p>
        <p>Kleenex will be the exclusive sponsor of a yearlong series of ''tear-jerker'' movies that TNT will show on Sundays beginning in October. Though the films have not been selected, they may include titles like ''An Officer and a Gentleman'' and ''Steel Magnolias.''</p>
        <p>The promotion includes a Kleenex ''rating system'' based on how much viewers may cry during a movie, as well as commercials on TNT that will show crying scenes from movies like ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''When Harry Met Sally.'' Kleenex will run commercials during each movie, and the opening and closing credits will mention Kleenex and TNT.</p>
        <p>The goal of the promotion, whose budget has not been disclosed, is to engage consumers on an emotional level, said Kurt Simon, product manager for Kleenex in Neenah, Wis.  There is a ''strong link between the emotional points in people's lives and how and when they would use Kleenex facial tissues,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kimberly-Clark worked on the promotion with its media buying agency, the Chicago office of MindShare, part of the WPP Group, as well as TNT.</p>
