        <p>In early July, IZZY ALCANTARA was eyeing the International League triple crown. Just a few days later, he was wearing the black hat of a villain.</p>
        <p>Alcantara, in his third season as a slugging outfielder with Pawtucket, was the league's player of the month for June after he hit .374 with 12 home runs and 34 runs batted in. But on July 3, in a home game against Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Alcantara earned national infamy.</p>
        <p>After pitcher BLAS CEDENO brushed him back on consecutive pitches, the 28-year-old Alcantara kicked catcher JEREMY SALAZAR and charged the mound. His wild swing missed Cedeno before third baseman KEVIN ORIE tackled him.</p>
        <p>The episode made national television highlight shows for days, cost Alcantara his place on the league's All-Star team and sent him into a slump. Leading the league in hitting and homers at the time of the fight, he hit .189 for July.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the organization's view of him has changed at all,'' said KENT QUALLS, the Boston Red Sox' director of player development. ''It was an unfortunate, isolated incident, but he apologized to the league and to the organiation. He was just extremely disappointed at being removed form the All-Star team, but otherwise, he's fine.''</p>
        <p>In 21 games over two brief call-ups last year, Alcantara hit .289 with four homers. But he drew the ire of JIMY WILLIAMS, then the Boston manager, because of what Williams saw as a lack of hustle.</p>
        <p>The team cannot ignore what Alcantara has accomplished this season, and it is expeted that he will be in Boston helping the Red Sox try ot make a September playoff push. Alcantara, a right-handed batter, came out of his slump and earned I.L. postseason All-Star honors with a .297 average. On Tuesday, he tied the franchise record with his 36th home run, a league best, and he is second on the league with 90 R.B.I.</p>
        <p>''Our feeling is, he can help our major league team,'' said Qualls, who has known Alcantara since he was 17 and both were in the Montreal organiation. ''We'd have liked to see him come around a little quicker, but he's a good-looking hitter right now, with tremendous power. And he deserves an opportunity to show what he can do at the major league level.''</p>
        <p>NEW YORK-PENN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Cyclones will begin selling playoff tickets Monday at 9 a.m. at the KeySpan Park box office. The Cyclones lead the McNamara Division by five games over the Staten Island Yankees with sevn to play. The two-of-three-game divisional series will begin Thursday at the home of the second-place team. Games 2 and 3 would be at the division winer's park. The Yankees lead Pittsfield by three games for the second playoff spot. Wlliam-sport has clinched the Pinckney Division, while Jamestown, Oneonta and Batavia are battling for second. The winner of each division series will meet in a two-of-three-game championship series. ... Brooklyn's MIKE COS (6-1) struck out 14 Hudson Valley batters Saturday in six innings of a 12-3 victory. ... Second baseman BERNIE CASTRO went 5 for 5 for Staten island last week in a 7-0 beating of Jamestown. Castro has 14 hits in 10 games with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>EASTERN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>Outfielder DUSTAN MHOR hit his eighth home run, a three-run shot, in his last 14 games Tuesday night in New Britain's 6-1 victory over Binghamton. Mohr, who entered the game batting .365 with 19 R.B.I. in August, was rewarded with a promotion to the struggling Twins. Mohr leads the league with a .336 average, is third with 91 R.B.I. and has a career-high 24 homers. ... Morwich's BRANDON CLAUSEEN won his sixth consecutive decision, 5-4 over Trenton last week, striking out eight in five and a third innings, including five in the frst two innings. He leads the minors with 209 strikeouts.</p>
        <p>SOUTH ATLANTIC LEAGUE</p>
        <p>Lakewood will break the New Jrsey attendance record this weekend. The BlueClaws have drawn 449,582 people to GPU Energy Park in their first season, averaging 6,812 a game. The Trenton Thunder drew 457,344 in 1998. ... Capital City has resembled the parent Mets of late. The Bombers dropped their 12th straight game Wednesday, have dropped 10 games below .500 and have scored more than one run in only two of their past seven games.</p>
        <p>TURNING IT AROUND</p>
        <p>The San Antonio Missions suffered through a nine-game losing streak in May and finished the first half ot he Class AA Texas League season with a 29-38 record, 19 1/2 games behind Round Rock in the Western Division. The second half has been a different story for the Seattle affiliate. Behind the pitching of JEFF HEAVERLO and J.J. Putz, the Missions fashioned a 13-game winning streak and lead the division by three games with a 38-28 record and four games to play.</p>
        <p>AROUND THE MINORS</p>
        <p>JOSH BARFIELD, the son of the former big leaguer JESSE BARFIELD, drove in 14 runs in 13 rookie-level games. The Padres selected Barfield in the fourth round of the June draft out of Klein High School in Spring, Tex. ... RICH ANKIEL pulled off a rare double: he was named the rookie-level Appalachian League's pitcher of the year as well as the designated hitter on the league's All-Star team. Kingsport Mets shortstop SEAN PITTMAN (.320, 17 steals before his promotion to Brooklyn this week) was also named to the team.</p>
