        <p>New York City Police Lt Michael J Gorman letter on Aug 23 article holds police should release as much documentary evidence as possible to prove that racial profiling does not exist</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The bill just passed by the City Council, requiring the Police Department to release information on the race and gender of people who are stopped and frisked, is a necessary and positive development (news article, Aug. 23). But if it fails to require the same of police stops that do not result in arrests or summonses, it has significant shortcomings.</p>
        <p>Currently, stop-and-frisk reports are required to be filled out whenever a person is stopped by use of force, frisked, searched or arrested, or refuses to identify himself. Why not release reports of stops that don't result in arrests or in summonses, which are served in lieu of arrest?</p>

        <p>It's not enough that the police do not engage in racial profiling if many blacks and Hispanics believe that they do.</p>
        <p>The Police Department should release as much documentary evidence as possible to prove that racial profiling does not exist.</p>
