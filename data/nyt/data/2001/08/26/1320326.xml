        <p>With much of European royalty looking on, the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon, today exchanged marriage vows with a woman who is no ordinary commoner.</p>
        <p>She is Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, 28, a former waitress with a 4-year-old son from a previous relationship and an admitted history of heavy partying in Oslo's drug-filled ''house party'' milieu. Barring the unexpected, she stands to become Norway's queen one day and one of Europe's most extraordinary sovereigns. For now, she is to be called Her Royal Majesty Crown Princess Mette-Marit, or more simply Mette-Marit.</p>

        <p>With much of European royalty looking on, the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon, today exchanged marriage vows with a woman who is no ordinary commoner.</p>
        <p>She is Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, 28, a former waitress with a 4-year-old son from a previous relationship and an admitted history of heavy partying in Oslo's drug-filled ''house party'' milieu. Barring the unexpected, she stands to become Norway's queen one day and one of Europe's most extraordinary sovereigns. For now, she is to be called Her Royal Majesty Crown Princess Mette-Marit, or more simply Mette-Marit.</p>
        <p>In a ceremony of pomp and splendor unusual for this egalitarian Nordic kingdom, Haakon and Mette-Marit were at their most majestic -- she in a gown of white silk crepe, with a 20-foot-long veil, and he in black army uniform with red sash and medals. Yet all 800 people in the cathedral, including Prince Charles and several other future monarchs with troubles in love, knew that Haakon and Mette-Marit were staking out a liberating new way to be royal.</p>
        <p>''In the last generation, they married commoners for the first time,'' said Theo Aronson, an English biographer of monarchs. ''This younger generation is now breaking free.'' Mette-Marit's rambunctious son, Marius, is hardly a liability. Already he has been dubbed Norway's ''charm troll'' -- a term of endearment -- and he was front and center in the ceremony today.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning, it was hard to make him understand that it was we who were getting married, and not him,'' Haakon said this week. ''So we just decided that all three of us would get married.''</p>
        <p>Support for the monarchy as an institution has hit record lows in the six months since Haakon and Mette-Marit, both 28, moved into an Oslo apartment with Marius, prompting a mild reproach from the state church. But 62 percent of Norwegians still call themselves monarchists.</p>
        <p>In a country in which half the babies are born out of wedlock, the fact that Mette-Marit has a child is no scandal. But Norwegians are conservative about drugs.</p>
        <p>''For me at that time, it was important to live contrary to what was accepted,'' she said on Wednesday.  She said she was now opposed to narcotics and said of the past, ''Unfortunately I cannot make those choices over again.''</p>
        <p>Haakon has a degree in political science from Berkeley and says he hopes to earn another degree and then get a job in foreign service.</p>
        <p>Mette-Marit, a high school graduate, said, ''I have enough to do going to princess school.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 4, 2001, Tuesday  An article on Aug. 26 about the wedding of Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby misstated the title to be used for the new crown princess. She will be Her Royal Highness, not Her Royal Majesty.</p>
