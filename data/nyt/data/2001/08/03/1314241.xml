        <p>Negotiations between General Motors and the creditors of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor of South Korea are at a standstill and are in danger of failure, according to people close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The G.M. team, led by Alan Perriton, the company's top executive in South Korea and Japan, is awaiting a response to its offer, said a G.M. spokesman, as Daewoo officials leak details of the talks to the Korean media.</p>
        <p>According to those reports, G.M. has offered far less than Daewoo creditors are demanding.</p>
        <p>In the most recent report, The Korea Economic Daily said yesterday that G.M. had offered $588 million covering only Daewoo's two most modern plants.</p>
        <p>G.M. officials have indicated their frustration over delays but have refused to disclose the size or content of their offer, citing what they said was an agreement not to discuss the negotiations. The confidentiality agreement was part of a memorandum of understanding that G.M. concluded on May 29 with the government-owned Korea Development Bank, the lead creditor for Daewoo Motor.</p>
        <p>The memorandum called for both sides to conclude a deal ''as rapidly as possible'' under which G.M. would finally take over Daewoo, whose sales have been declining since the collapse of the entire Daewoo group in mid-1999.</p>
