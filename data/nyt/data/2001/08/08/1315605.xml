        <p>If he were mayor, Peter F. Vallone would scrap the insurance premiums that hundreds of thousands of low-income parents pay for government-subsidized health insurance for their children, his aides said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Instead, the city would pick up the cost of the premiums, which range from $108 to $180 a year per child. Campaign aides said they hoped such an incentive would compel many more parents to sign up. There are roughly 300,000 city children eligible but not yet enrolled in Child Health Plus, as the insurance program is called.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone's aides floated the proposal on what turned out to be a busy but relatively calm day for the six major candidates running on the Democratic and Republican tickets: one picked up a lucrative endorsement, others discussed their own mayoral wish lists, and all of them shook sweaty hands at subway stations and senior centers across the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone, the City Council president and one of four Democratic contenders in the mayoral race, plans to formally announce his child health insurance plan this afternoon as part of a longer wish list on health care. His aides said that picking up the tab for the premiums would  roughly $147 million a year, most of which, they said, could be diverted from other areas of the city's budget.</p>
        <p>Other candidates have talked about enrolling eligible children in the program. For instance, Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire Republican, yesterday urged that they be signed up at school.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vallone's campaign aides asserted that they would go the furthest to extend coverage to poor children by removing the financial barrier for their parents. While New York's poorest children get free coverage through Medicaid, children whose family incomes are within 250 percent of the poverty line are eligible for subsidized coverage that imposes a modest premium.</p>
        <p>''We think a large component of this is going to parents and saying, 'Your child will have health care coverage that's free, absolutely free,' '' one campaign adviser said. ''That's a far cry from saying, 'We're going to go into schools and enroll kids.' ''</p>
        <p>Children's advocates welcomed Mr. Vallone's proposal, but some said that without proper investments in the public hospital system, defraying the premiums alone would be insufficient. After all, they said, the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation is so broke that it recently proposed shutting down a handful of neighborhood-based child health clinics. ''Enrollment without access is half a loaf,'' said Irwin Redlener, a Bronx pediatrician and president of the Children's Health Fund, an advocacy group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, offering a glimpse into his positions on a range of social issues for the first time yesterday, said that if he were running City Hall, he would institute what he called zero tolerance against misbehaving students in the classroom. ''That's the next big focus for any administration,'' he said this morning at a forum sponsored by Safe Horizons, a group that has received funding from Mr. Bloomberg for its advocacy on behalf of domestic-violence victims. ''There are abusive children in the classroom and they are not being removed.''</p>
        <p>Zero-tolerance policies have been widely adopted across the country, but also widely criticized. The American Bar Association passed a resolution earlier this year calling for an end to such policies. Mr. Bloomberg  suggested that counselors work with the children, but he was short on specific ideas about what to do with them out of the classroom. Answering questions from reporters, Mr. Bloomberg said he did not believe additional police officers were needed in city schools; he suggested that  surveillance cameras could be installed in stairwells instead.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Herman Badillo, the other Republican candidate, who has yet to raise enough money to qualify for matching city funds, received a bit of good news: leaders of the 1,200-member Gramercy Park Republican Club threw their endorsement, and their fund-raising heft, behind him.</p>
        <p>On Public Advocate Mark Green's mayoral wish list yesterday was a plan to establish 12 comprehensive rape treatment centers in hospitals throughout the city, and to require all hospital emergency rooms to provide rape counseling. Under his proposal, which he said would require $1 million each from the city and state, the hospital treatment centers would employ forensic examiners to collect evidence that could be used in court.</p>
