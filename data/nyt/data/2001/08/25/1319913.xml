        <p>In the clearest sign yet that she intends to run for the Senate in her native state, North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole registered to vote in Salisbury, where she was reared and where her mother still lives. Mrs. Dole, a former Republican presidential candidate, said she would decide ''soon after Labor Day'' whether to run for the seat being vacated by Senator Jesse Helms. On Thursday, Mrs. Dole terminated her voter registration in Kansas, the home state of her husband, former Senator Bob Dole.</p>
