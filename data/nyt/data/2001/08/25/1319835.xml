        <p>Asian-Americans, for years hardly a speck on the jigsaw puzzle of New York City's ethnic politics, are emerging this year as a force to be courted.</p>
        <p>Just look at the candidates running in the unusually crowded contest for mayor: they are popping into subway stations in Chinatown, taking tea with Indians in Staten Island, printing up Chinese-language palm cards for Election Day. Some Sundays, they are stepping into Hindu temples, or dropping in on parades celebrating the Indians' and Pakistanis' freedom from British rule. Nearly all of them are hitching onto the campaigns of any one of a dozen Asian-American City Council candidates, hoping to ride their coattails as they draw their respective compatriots to the voting booth next month.</p>
        <p>Nearly 1 in 10 New Yorkers are of Asian ancestry, making New York City home to the largest number of Asian-Americans in the country. Yet no Asian-American has ever held elected office in the city, though this year's City Council election is likely to change that.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that they're paying a little bit more attention to our community's needs because our population has grown substantially,'' said Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group. ''There have been ongoing voter registration efforts, especially this year with all the City Council races, which has led to a lot more activity in our communities. The mayoral candidates are aware of that as well.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in a citywide race, the six major mayoral candidates have attended a series of breakfast meetings held by the Asian American Federation of New York, a coalition of about 60 civic, business and social service organizations. In previous elections, organizers with the federation said they would not have dreamed of perfect attendance.</p>
        <p>The annual India Day parade, the loud display of Indian patriotism along Madison Avenue last Sunday, attracted three of the mayoral hopefuls: the Republican candidates, Michael R. Bloomberg and Herman Badillo, and a Democrat, Alan G. Hevesi. That same afternoon, a second Democrat, Mark Green, was at the Pakistanis' annual independence celebration in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>A house party is planned for Sunday at which Mr. Bloomberg is to meet with Indian-Americans in Staten Island. Pakistani New Yorkers are also in Mr. Bloomberg's column, his aides say, as are Chinese-American businessmen in Flushing, with whom the billionaire Republican recently held a news conference with Chinese-language media.</p>
        <p>An aide to the Democratic contender Fernando Ferrer is quick to point out that he has campaigned with an Asian-American Council candidate in Chinatown, Margaret Chin. Aides to Peter F. Vallone, the fourth Democrat, say he spent a Sunday popping into four Hindu temples in Queens.</p>
        <p>What is more, many of the candidates can count on backing from Asian-American donors this year, though Mr. Hevesi has clearly been the most successful in this regard. Among his largest contributors is a lumber company owner from Flushing, Jimmy Meng, who has collected nearly $177,000 in contributions from a number of his fellow Chinese-Americans.</p>
        <p>Beyond the emerging significance of Asian-Americans, who have traditionally been seen as being too new to the country to participate in elections, such activities underscore a broader shift in the ethnic politics of New York City. No longer is it sufficient to court the usual voting blocs: blacks, Jews, Italians, Irish. The black vote is Caribbean and African-American; Hispanics are from all over the Caribbean and Latin America; and the white vote includes Russian newcomers as well as the liberal Upper West Side establishment.</p>
        <p>''I think that it's a major shift, because the diversity is now more breathtaking than ever,'' said Richard Schrader, Mr. Green's campaign manager. The Green campaign's approach to that diversity is simple. ''I think the new arrivals care about the same things,'' Mr. Schrader said. ''And that's schools and public safety and jobs.''</p>
        <p>New Yorkers who trace their roots to Asia are a spread-out, mixed bunch -- from Indo-Caribbeans in Richmond Hill to Chinese-Americans in Sheepshead Bay to Korean-Americans in Flushing. Their ideological leanings and their socioeconomic profiles vary widely; their votes, by all accounts, are up for grabs.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to know with any certainty how many of the city's voters are of Asian ancestry. But an analysis of voter rolls based on last names suggests that as of March, Asian-Americans were roughly 3.5 percent of the city's 3.6 million registered voters, or about 125,000 people.</p>
        <p>Such a figure would be inconsequential were it not for the unusually close contest for the Democratic nomination for mayor. With Mr. Green leading in most polls, the three other candidates are battling among themselves for enough second-place votes to force a runoff. ''The thing to remember is that in a four-way race, every vote counts,'' said Josh Isay, the spokesman for Mr. Hevesi. ''The difference between second and fourth place can be 20,000 votes. In that sense, the Asian-American community's importance is greater because any one group can swing it.''</p>
        <p>The analysis of the voter rolls by Jerry Skurnik, a political consultant unattached to any one mayoral candidate, also found that among Asian-American voters, about half are Democrats, 17 percent are Republicans, and the rest are up for grabs.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of year where you've got to think outside the box,'' said Kevin Wardally, a campaign strategist for Mr. Vallone. ''We spend a lot more time than we would have in the past courting Asian-American voters.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Vallone, that courtship means sharing campaign volunteers with two Asian-American Council candidates, both in his home turf, Queens: Terrence Park, a Korean-American vying for the Flushing seat, and J. D. Thakral, an Indian-American running in the borough's northeast fringe. Mr. Vallone has appeared on ethnic television interviews with the two men. He has shaken sweaty palms with them at joint campaign stops. He hopes to capitalize on the increased turnout that both men hope to gain from the candidates' compatriots.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, Asian-Americans are paying closer attention to the mayor's race than ever before. There has been a flurry of voter registration efforts all year long. In certain precincts, the prospect of electing the first Asian-American to city office -- a dozen candidates are running for City Council, in several neighborhoods across the city -- is expected to generate unprecedented turnout for the primary on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>Asian-American community organizers say they are heartened by the attention Asian-Americans are getting from the mayoral candidates. And yet some of them wonder aloud whether the candidates understand the issues that are important to many Asian-American voters: access to government services for people who do not speak English; money for Asian-American community organizations; expansion of affordable housing and classes in English as a second language.</p>
        <p>''There's more activity, but I really would like to see substance,'' said Christopher Kui, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, a nonprofit organization specializing in housing issues. ''The Asian-American vote could make a critical difference. That's why if any of the candidates are serious about capturing that vote, they need to develop a stronger platform on immigrant issues.''</p>
