        <p>INVESTORS in the new economy are being forced to deal with the reality that technology companies can fall on tough times.</p>
        <p>Investors in old-economy stocks see that times are bad but also know that history suggests that conditions are going to get better. Such is the way with cyclical stocks.</p>
        <p>Chemical companies are part of the cyclical genus. Kim Ritrievi and Avi Nash, analysts at Goldman, Sachs, took time last week to talk about the business. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. -- Kim, you follow specialty chemical companies; Avi, many of the companies you follow are commodity chemical producers. How bad is business?</p>
        <p>RITRIEVI -- Demand continues to be weak, and is terrible for some products. Depending on the end market, demand runs from being okay, up in the single digits, to just dreadful, down 20 percent to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>NASH -- This is different from the 1990-1991 downturn in a couple of respects. First, in the last downturn, Asia was not slowing down. And the volume slowdown we are seeing is much sharper in this go-around. Those are two big differences. We are starting to approach the severity of the 1980-1982 recession.</p>
        <p>Q. -- The market tends to anticipate an upturn well before it actually happens. How long before the business forms a bottom?</p>
        <p>NASH -- Stocks started anticipating a turn in the fourth quarter of last year. They did well for six months starting in October of last year, then decelerated and in the last three months have started pulling back.</p>
        <p>Companies are not yet seeing the bottom. Profitability is extremely poor; many companies are losing money. That usually ends up calling the trough in the cycle. I think this year will be the bottom.</p>
        <p>RITRIEVI -- Over the last twelve months, the stocks I follow have been terrific. On a relative basis, I have only one stock that has underperformed the S.&amp; P. 500, Dupont Photomasks. If we had been talking a year ago, only two stocks of the 15 stocks on my list were up in a period of time when the S.&amp; P. was up 12 percent.</p>
        <p>The move has been anticipatory. In the last industrial recession in the early 1990's, specialty chemical companies bottomed before the industrial economy did. The stocks are anticipating that industrial production is going to bottom at some point over the next couple of quarters.</p>
        <p>Q. -- How long should an investor own a cyclical stock like a chemical company?</p>
        <p>RITRIEVI -- On a cyclical stock, you will generally get eighteen months to two years of outperformance in the cycle. On a cyclical basis, that means the stocks I follow have another three to four quarters of good performance in them, based on the notion the industrial economy bottoms out in the second half of this year and improves in 2002.</p>
        <p>NASH -- The market tends to get into these stocks six to twelve months before the bottom, and out 15 months to 30 months before earnings peak out.</p>
        <p>Very few of these stocks have a holding period of four to five years. In general, it is anywhere from six months to two years. We think there is a 60 percent probability that earnings will peak in 2004.</p>
        <p>Q. -- Which of these stocks do you like? Which ones would you avoid?</p>
        <p>RITRIEVI -- I have buy ratings on Air Products and Chemicals, Cabot Corporation, Ecolab Inc. and two small-cap companies, Ferro Corporation and Valspar Corporation.</p>
        <p>We have neutral ratings on four stocks: Dupont Photomasks, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, Photronics Inc. and Airgas Inc.</p>
        <p>NASH -- Right now the multiples on commodity chemical companies are higher than the overall market multiple. But that doesn't mean anything because the earnings are basically zero.</p>
        <p>On a normalized earnings basis, these stocks are trading at eight times earnings. Dow Chemical, the best of the lot, is trading at 12.7 times earnings. As measured by the S.&amp; P. 500, the market is trading at 21.6 times earnings.</p>
        <p>Among mainstream chemical companies, we think Dow has an intrinsic value of $43. At its current price in the mid-$30's and close to a 4 percent dividend yield, the stock looks attractive.</p>
        <p>And we like Monsanto because of its new product pipeline and because of existing products where the cost structure is terrific. The stock's intrinsic value is $44, and the stock is in the mid-$30's. If things go right there is a reasonable chance that within three years the stock could be at the $60 level.</p>
