        <p>THE RED OF HIS SHADOW</p>
        <p>By Mayra Montero.</p>
        <p>Translated by Edith Grossman.</p>
        <p>159 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Ecco Press/</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $22.</p>
        <p>THE intricacies of voodoo, while known to a few practitioners in the United States, remain a mystery to most of us, often inspiring a kind of wild unease coupled with callous dismissiveness. It's nothing but smelly love potions and fiendish devil worship, a source of menace in B movies, an anthropological curiosity. But for readers willing to set aside such stereotypes, Mayra Montero's transfixing new novel, ''The Red of His Shadow,'' offers potent insights into a highly complex world.</p>
        <p>Based, an author's note informs us, on ''real events,'' the story is given mythic proportions; except for a few details scattered throughout the novel, it's hard to tell that the setting is contemporary. That's because Montero, a Cuban writer now living in Puerto Rico (where she writes a column for the newspaper El Nuevo Día), quickly transports us deep into the company of the isolated communities of Haitians -- or Congos, as they are called across the border in the Dominican Republic -- who travel through the mountains of Hispaniola to work in the Dominican sugar cane fields, performing the still-brutal work that their slave ancestors revolted against long ago. Plunged directly into a culture and belief system radically different from our own, we come away humbled, confused, alienated, delighted, terrified -- awash in sensations that challenge our easy assumption that there are only a few ways of living in these modern times, all of which have modern amenities.</p>
        <p>The story centers on Zulé, a dynamic young voodoo priestess, or mambo, as she and her retinue travel in a ceremonial pilgrimage during Holy Week from one rural settlement to another. The mambos and their male counterparts, the houngans, are relatively benign spiritual leaders, but other members of the faith are less so. Zulé is threatened by one of these, the sensual and predatory Similá Bolosse, a bokor, or voodoo priest who ''works with both hands,'' for good and for evil.</p>
        <p>A few years earlier, Similá had arrived at Zulé's doorstep delirious and covered with sores. Zulé provided a cure, medically and sexually, but the consequences of her generosity continue to haunt her. Now Similá wants her to join him in an ''alliance.'' If she refuses, he has sworn to intercept her on her long-planned route and kill her. Joined by her father, Papa Luc, and her devoted and jealous bodyguard, Jérémie Candé (the son of Zulé's voodoo mentor and a Chinese chambermaid), she debates her decision as the novel proceeds to its dramatic end.</p>
        <p>Moving between flashbacks to Zulé's youth and scenes of the present, Montero skillfully inserts voodoo rituals into the narrative as she draws out a tale of doomed passion and fatal pride. Although it has its moments of excess, particularly in the occasionally florid writing style, Edith Grossman's translation is supple and elegant, and Montero's unromantic vision and crisp pace strike a harmonious balance with the lushness of the background detail. The brevity of the novel allows us to focus on its tightly wound plot and its timeless archetypal confrontation.</p>
        <p>Yet the novel's strength is also its weakness, as Montero loses clarity for the sake of narrative authenticity. We see sacrifices to the loas, spirits that mediate between human beings and the natural and metaphysical worlds, and hear of amarres, or spells, and the cult of the dead, but without more knowledge of this highly intricate religion, its deeper meanings are lost. The novel's glossary is essential but insufficient. It helps to remember, for example, that the Tontons Macoute (not included in the glossary) with whom Similá is allied are the descendants of the secret police used by Papa Doc Duvalier to enforce his violent dictatorship. With this awareness, some of Montero's underlying themes become clearer, allowing the story to be read as a metaphor for the battle between a traditional matriarchal way of life and the new regime of a bloodthirsty male leader intent on creating a drug trafficking empire.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the novel's sense of immediacy, of moving into fearsome unknown territory, would surely be sapped by too many explanatory detours. Books like this can invite us to walk through doors we didn't even know existed, and our sense of discovery contributes to the narrative tension. What is without doubt is Montero's ability to draw on our curiosity and bring to life a place and people both rich and, to some of us, strange.</p>
