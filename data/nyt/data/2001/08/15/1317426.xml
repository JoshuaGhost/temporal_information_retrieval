        <p>By the time the Liberty took the court last night, the scoreboard at Madison Square Garden was beginning to signal the team's fate in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>At the start of the Liberty-Washington Mystics game, the Liberty and the Miami Sol were tied for second place in the W.N.B.A. East with 20-11 records. If Miami beat the Charlotte Sting, it would secure home-court advantage in the first-round series with the Liberty since it had the tie breaker, having taken their season series. A loss by Miami, coupled with a victory by New York, would give the Liberty the edge in the two-of-three-game series.</p>
        <p>By the time the Liberty's Tari Phillips won the tip-off, the scoreboard showed the Sting ahead of the Sol, 16-15.</p>
        <p>For the next six minutes of play, the scoreboard score remained frozen, toying with the emotions of the 18,213 fans.</p>
        <p>When the Liberty headed to the locker room at halftime with a 31-28 lead over Washington, its hopes of gaining home-court advantage looked promising. The Sting, which defeated the Liberty, 80-60, last Saturday in Charlotte, was leading the Sol, 36-28.</p>
        <p>New York returned for the second half with Charlotte having defeated the Sol, 48-41. With the ball now squarely in its court, the Liberty played like a newly inspired team, capitalizing on Washington's turnovers and inconsistent shooting to defeat the Mystics, 71-56. The victory improved New York's record to 21-11, its most victories ever, and sent the Liberty to Miami on Friday a more confident team, having won five of its last seven games.</p>
        <p>''The coaching staff knew at halftime that Charlotte had won, but we didn't tell the team,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato said. ''We didn't want to add extra pressure. I liked the way they were playing.''</p>
        <p>And continued to play.</p>
        <p>The Liberty began the second half with Crystal Robinson hitting a 13-foot jump shot after a turnover by Nikki McCray. New York completed a 20-8 run to take a 51-36 lead with 9 minutes 55 seconds remaining, led by Robinson and Vickie Johnson, who padded their first-half team high 6 points with two 3-pointers each. Robinson finished with a team-high 15 points. Johnson and Phillips finished with 12 points each. The Mystics' Chamique Holdsclaw led all scorers with 17 points.</p>
        <p>The Mystics narrowed the margin to 67-54 on a layup by Holdsclaw with 59 seconds left to play. Vickie Bullett fouled Camille Cooper in the backcourt, sending Cooper to the line for a one-and-one. Cooper hit both free throws to give New York a 69-54 lead. Bullett made a layup with 46 seconds to go and Phillips closed out the game with a 13-foot jumper.</p>
        <p>''Our offense sparked the defense,'' Robinson said. ''That really helped us. Whenever we play our best defense, we win games.''</p>
        <p>Although the Liberty tried to play down the importance of last night's game, it was evident from the moment Kym Hampton, the former Liberty All-Star who retired last season, stepped to the microphone, flanked by her teammates, and sang a soulful rendition of the national anthem.</p>
        <p>Sitting in the locker room before the game, Johnson said the Liberty had to come out focused and not put undue pressure on themselves or make the critical error of taking last-place Washington lightly.</p>
        <p>''The pressure is on the Sol,'' Johnson said of the second-year expansion team. ''They've never been to the playoffs and it's tough. Very tough.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Liberty and the Sol will return to New York for Game 2 on Sunday and Game 3, if necessary, on Tuesday night. . . . The Liberty finished No. 1 in the league in attendance, drawing 250,565 for an average of 15,490 a game.</p>

        <p>Sol Loses at Home</p>
        <p>MIAMI, Aug. 14, (AP) -- Tammy Sutton-Brown and Andrea Stinson each scored 8 points to lead a balanced attack as the Charlotte Sting extended its franchise-record winning streak to seven games with a 48-41 victory over the Miami Sol tonight.</p>
        <p>Dawn Staley and Shalonda Enis each scored 7 points for the Sting (18-14), which will face the No. 1-seeded Cleveland Rockers in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.</p>
        <p>Charlotte, 17-4 since its 1-10 start, snapped Miami's five-game winning streak. Sheri Sam had 14 points and Sandy Brondello 12 for the Sol, which shot 16 for 59 (27.1 percent).</p>
