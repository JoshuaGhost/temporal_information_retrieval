      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The AremisSoft Corporation said yesterday that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that Lycourgos K. Kyprianou, its chairman, had resigned.</p>
        <p>AremisSoft, a software company, also announced that its revenue and profit for the second quarter and all of 2001 would fall substantially short of analysts' estimates. The company said it did not know when it would release its second-quarter financial results.</p>
        <p>In addition, the company said that Michael Tymvios, its chief financial officer, had resigned for health reasons and that its auditors could not find $5.4 million that AremisSoft booked as revenue last year. AremisSoft said it had asked PKF, its auditor, to review its books, but that the inquiry had been delayed because AremisSoft had been unable to contact its own executives to get information that PKF needed to complete the review.</p>
        <p>AremisSoft also said it had promoted Roys Poyiadjis, its current chief executive, to replace Mr. Kyprianou as chairman. It said Mr. Kyprianou, would become ''founding chairman,'' a nonexecutive advisory position, ''in recognition of his founding the company and his long years of service.''</p>
        <p>David Latzke, the former chief financial officer of the Fourth Shift Corporation, a Minneapolis company that AremisSoft bought earlier this year, will become AremisSoft's new chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>AremisSoft's announcement came yesterday afternoon, hours after the Nasdaq stock market halted trading in the company's shares. Trading in AremisSoft had been stopped since Monday, when the company asked for a temporary halt so that it could release news. But the Nasdaq has now taken responsibility for the halt away from the company, so AremisSoft can no longer control when its shares will resume trading.</p>
        <p>As of last night, trading in AremisSoft shares remained halted even after the company's news release. Scott Peterson, a Nasdaq spokesman, said that he did not know when the Nasdaq would allow trading in AremisSoft shares to resume.</p>
        <p>AremisSoft, with offices in Westmont, N.J., near Camden, trades on Nasdaq, although the majority of its sales come from overseas and its top executives work from London.</p>
        <p>For months, some of Wall Street's top short-sellers have contended that AremisSoft's reported results are largely mythical. Meanwhile, the company's supporters, including the Minneapolis financier Irwin Jacobs, have complained that the short-sellers, who profit from falling stock prices, have waged a smear campaign against AremisSoft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs has been a particularly vocal defender of AremisSoft, posting more than 30 messages on his Web site offering bullish comments and criticizing short-sellers and reporters. ''I believe this is an incredible buying opportunity,'' he wrote in a posting on June 4.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs did not return calls for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Neil Herman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who rated AremisSoft as a strong buy for most of this year before cutting his rating to market perform two weeks ago, also did not return calls for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Poyiadjis, AremisSoft's new chairman, and Dr. Paul I. Bloom, whom AremisSoft promoted yesterday from president of its American  division to president, also did not return calls for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. declined to confirm or deny its investigation, as is its standard policy.</p>
        <p>But short-sellers were not so reticent. ''It's clear that AremisSoft has either overstated its numbers or made up its numbers, and used Irwin Jacobs and Wall Street to run a charade, and they're caught,'' said Marc Cohodes, a short-seller who has been a vocal critic of the company. AremisSoft sued Mr. Cohodes and several other short-sellers in early July, charging they were part of a conspiracy to drive down its stock price.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement by the company comes two months after The New York Times and TheStreet.com reported that the Bulgarian government and the World Bank said that a contract Bulgaria signed with AremisSoft was worth less than $4 million, one-tenth the value assigned by the company.</p>
        <p>Later, The Times reported that AremisSoft executives in India said that contracts the company had signed with the Indian Army were worth much less than the company had told its American investors.</p>
        <p>At the time, AremisSoft said it had not misled investors about how much its contracts were worth. Yesterday, the company said it was cooperating with an S.E.C. investigation into its Bulgarian contract, as well as other issues it did not disclose. Last year, the company booked more than $7 million in revenue from the Bulgarian contract, and Mr. Jacobs wrote in June on his Web site that he had ''personally inspected'' $7.17 million in bank deposit receipts related to the contract.</p>
        <p>But AremisSoft said yesterday that its auditor had been able to confirm only $1.7 million in payments from the National Health Insurance Fund of Bulgaria and had asked for ''additional documentation'' to confirm the rest.</p>
        <p>''The company, despite its continued efforts, has been unable over the last several days to contact executives who are most knowledgeable about the N.H.I.F. contractual arrangements,'' AremisSoft said yesterday. As a result, ''it has been unable to provide PKF with the information it needs to complete its review.''</p>
