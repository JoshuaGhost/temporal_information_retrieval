        <p>Letter from Sen Charles E Schumer disputes July 26 article and July 28 editorial on failed quest for Middle East peace; says Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat deserves lion's share of blame for orchestrating wave of violence</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 26 front-page article ''Quest for Mideast Peace: How and Why It Failed'' and your July 28 editorial ''Looking Back at Camp David,'' which suggest that Yasir Arafat was not the only one to blame for the failure of Camp David, miss the forest for the trees.</p>
        <p>Of course not every misstep was made by Yasir Arafat. Of course the timing for the final-status talks may not have been perfect. But this does not diminish the reality that Ehud Barak offered the Palestinians a state of their own on 97 percent of the West Bank with a capital in East Jerusalem, to which Mr. Arafat said no. And instead of choosing peace, Mr. Arafat orchestrated a wave of violence that has brought Israeli-Palestinian relations back to ground zero.</p>

        <p>Of course not every misstep was made by Yasir Arafat. Of course the timing for the final-status talks may not have been perfect. But this does not diminish the reality that Ehud Barak offered the Palestinians a state of their own on 97 percent of the West Bank with a capital in East Jerusalem, to which Mr. Arafat said no. And instead of choosing peace, Mr. Arafat orchestrated a wave of violence that has brought Israeli-Palestinian relations back to ground zero.</p>
        <p>Your news article said that contrary to the feeling of some, ''Mr. Barak did not offer Mr. Arafat the moon at Camp David.'' In fact, for Mr. Arafat, the moon meant an independent state plus the right of return to Israeli land for all Palestinians displaced since Israel's 1948 war of independence. Mr. Arafat knew full well that such a demand would put a stake through the heart of the Oslo process.</p>
