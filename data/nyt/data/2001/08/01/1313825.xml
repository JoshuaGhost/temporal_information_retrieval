        <p>Editorial says there is no easy end to Britain's costly battle against foot-and-mouth disease</p>

        <p>In early June Prime Minister Tony Blair summed up the struggle in Britain against foot-and-mouth disease, which by then had caused the destruction of some 2.5 million animals and the postponement of the general election. ''The battle is not over yet,'' he said, and then added, ''We are getting the disease under control.'' Mr. Blair has been right on both counts. The number of new cases reported has steadily dropped since late April, though at a nearly crippling cost to farmers in the north and west and to the national treasury. By early June the air of crisis hanging over Britain, caused in part by the closing of much of the rural countryside, had subsided enough to allow elections to proceed and a hint of optimism to creep into Mr. Blair's voice.</p>
        <p>But confirmed cases of foot-and-mouth disease are still being identified, though at a much lower rate than before, bringing the total as of yesterday to 1,914. The effort to stem this highly contagious disease means that animals may have to be slaughtered if they have had contact with an infected farm, if they live on contiguous premises or if they merely have foot-and-mouth-like symptoms. The number of animals slaughtered or held for slaughter has now reached 3.6 million, and the government has spent about $1.5 billion on containment and compensation, facts that are both political and social liabilities.</p>

        <p>But confirmed cases of foot-and-mouth disease are still being identified, though at a much lower rate than before, bringing the total as of yesterday to 1,914. The effort to stem this highly contagious disease means that animals may have to be slaughtered if they have had contact with an infected farm, if they live on contiguous premises or if they merely have foot-and-mouth-like symptoms.

        <p>In the latest step to curb this dismaying epidemic, strict new bio-security measures have been introduced in the past few days in North Yorkshire, and extensive tests have been ordered for animals there and in southern Wales. The tightness of the restrictions in North Yorkshire is a result of newly confirmed foot-and-mouth cases near Whitby. It is also a direct measure of the number of pigs in the vicinity, where nearly a third of the national herd lives. One whiff of foot-and-mouth disease among them and most would vanish in the general destruction caused by the effort to end this outbreak, the way the pig herds on Taiwan vanished four years ago. There is no easy end to foot-and-mouth disease, and when the end does finally come it will be months before anyone can really be sure.</p>
