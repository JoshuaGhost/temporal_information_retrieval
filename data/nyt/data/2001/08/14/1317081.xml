        <p>Two large European advertising companies reported first-half results today that offered starkly different views of the sharp downturn in ad spending.</p>
        <p>The Cordiant Communications Group of Britain, whose clients include Heineken and Hyundai, said there were few signs that ad spending would soon recover as the slowdown in North America spread to Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Publicis Groupe, the French company that created a campaign to introduce the euro, offered a more bullish outlook, saying that ad spending could pick up late this year.</p>
        <p>Analysts tended to take Cordiant's more cautious view of an industry that has been bludgeoned by a steep decline in spending.</p>
        <p>''We're not seeing any turnaround yet,'' said Neil Blackley, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''We don't expect to see year-over-year growth until the second quarter of 2002.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts noted that Cordiant, in offering a more bearish outlook, might be trying to regain credibility after previously setting targets that were too aggressive. Cordiant had originally forecast 5 percent revenue growth this year. In June, it advised analysts to lower their estimates, and it said today that it expected revenue for all of 2001 to be flat. Excluding acquisitions, revenue grew 0.2 percent in the first six months of the year, to Â£209 million ($298 million).</p>
        <p>Cordiant, which owns Bates Worldwide in the United States, also said it would take a $14.3 million charge this year to cover the elimination of hundreds of jobs.</p>
        <p>''We're telling it how it is,'' said Michael Bungey, Cordiant's chief executive. ''There is no upturn as far as we can see this year, and there is increasing evidence of softness in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Helping insulate Publicis is an aggressive push for new business;  United Airlines and VoiceStream are among its new clients. So far this year, Publicis lags only the WPP Group in net new billing dollars, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>For the first six months of the year, Publicis reported $1.3 billion in net new business, compared with $300 million at Cordiant.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Cordiant has greater exposure to some volatile markets in the Asia-Pacific region. It is, for example, the leading agency company in Australia, a market that has had a severe downturn the last year.</p>
        <p>Publicis, by contrast, derives less than 10 percent of its revenue from the region. The company, which owns Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Worldwide among other agencies, said that billings, excluding the effect of acquisitions, grew 6.3 percent, to 7.5 billion euros ($6.7 billion), in the first six months of the year, outpacing the 2 percent average growth for the industry. Billings include the total amount of money spent by clients; revenue is only the portion of billings directly attributable to the agency.</p>
