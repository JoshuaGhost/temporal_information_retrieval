        <p>In a bid to aid Brazil's money-losing, debt-ridden domestic airlines, the government has removed ceilings on ticket prices for flights within Brazil.</p>
        <p>The move, sought by the airlines for years, allows them for the first time to adopt the widespread industry practice of charging last-minute travelers and those who fly at peak times higher fares, while offering discounts to those who book in advance or fly during off hours.</p>
        <p>Under government price ceilings, the airlines said, they could not afford to offer discounts to fill empty seats because they could not charge full-fare customers enough to compensate.</p>
        <p>As a result, though in-country tourism is growing, only about one Brazilian in five has ever flown; the rest ride for days on buses or drive to move around the country.</p>
        <p>The government had been reluctant to remove fare ceilings for fear of price gouging by the airlines. But an experimental freeing of prices on 11 routes in April found that average fares remained at or below the former ceilings. The new policy, announced on Friday, took effect today.</p>
        <p>Brazil does not regulate fares on international flights.</p>
        <p>The government hopes the move will also encourage new entries in the domestic market. Industry experts point to the success of Gol, which began flying in January and models itself on low-cost regional carriers like Southwest Airlines in the United States. With deeply discounted tickets sold largely over the Internet, Gol is expected to capture 9 percent of the domestic market this year.</p>
        <p>But the added competition has further eroded the finances of established carriers, which may force consolidation in the industry.</p>
