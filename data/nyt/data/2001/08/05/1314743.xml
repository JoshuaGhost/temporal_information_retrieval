        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Wendy Lesser's contempt for ''Six Feet Under'' reminds me of the anger displayed by watchdogs who complain that Vogue is nothing but ads and that the women on ''Sex and the City'' could never afford those fabulous outfits. She holds up ''The Sopranos'' as a guiding force and calls it ''eloquently instructive.'' Shiver. Is this by way of a mandate that states that all entertainment must better us as people?</p>

        <p>I agree that the show's creator, Alan Ball, is a rather lightweight talent, and I, too, was disheartened when his film ''American Beauty'' was acclaimed as an indictment of the collective American soul. Macabre is his best thing, and ''Six Feet Under'' is doing creepy pretty well. It's a show that uses queasiness as its motor. I'm having a good time watching it. I'm just wondering if they can keep all the skulls in the air as the characters become familiar and possibly cuddly.</p>
