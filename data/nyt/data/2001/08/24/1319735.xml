        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN PIE 2,'' starring Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Shannon Elizabeth and Alyson Hannigan. Directed by J. B. Rogers (R, 104 minutes). This sequel reunites the Michigan teenagers whose clumsy eagerness to be relieved of their virginity fueled the first picture. A lot of the humor in this film consists of references to stuff that happened the first time around, though Mr. Biggs does encounter some novel forms of sexual humiliation, including the painful misapplication of some super-adhesive glue. The rest of the cast members return, some of them quite briefly, for more of the dirty-minded, curiously sweet-natured scenes that are the secret of the franchise's success (A. O. Scott).</p>

        <p>''AMERICAN PIE 2,'' starring Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Shannon Elizabeth and Alyson Hannigan. Directed by J. B. Rogers (R, 104 minutes). This sequel reunites the Michigan teenagers whose clumsy eagerness to be relieved of their virginity fueled the first picture. A lot of the humor in this film consists of references to stuff that happened the first time around, though Mr. Biggs does encounter some novel forms of sexual humiliation, including the painful misapplication of some super-adhesive glue. The rest of the cast members return, some of them quite briefly, for more of the dirty-minded, curiously sweet-natured scenes that are the secret of the franchise's success (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>''AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS,'' starring Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack. Directed by Joe Roth (PG-13, 100 minutes). In spite of a scattering of funny lines, a game performance by Ms. Zeta-Jones and amusing walk-ons by Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken, this crowded, glossy comedy lacks both the bite of real satire and the giddy effervescence of screwball. Mr. Cusack and Ms. Zeta-Jones are a pair of narcissistic movie stars whose real-life breakup threatens the profitability of their new movie. Mr. Crystal plays the over-the-hill publicist who organizes a press junket at which all manner of not terribly surprising complications ensue. Ms. Roberts plays Ms. Zeta-Jones's ugly-duckling sister, who is also her long-suffering assistant and her rival for Mr. Cusack's affections (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX,'' starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (R, 196 minutes). Nearly an hour has been added to Mr. Coppola's 1979 Vietnam epic, making the movie richer, stranger and more coherent. It has been rereleased in a stunning new print that showcases Vittorio Storaro's lustrous cinematography and Walter Murch's swirling, precise sound design, as well as Mr. Coppola's grand and sometimes murky vision. The movie's essential seriousness, its brave ambition and the dedication of its cast (now expanded to include Colleen Camp as a Playboy centerfold and Aurore Clément as a French widow) have grown more impressive with time. The current vogue for digitally enhanced, computer-generated special effects in live-action movies, for jumpy, gestural editing and for glib pseudo-irony has lulled us into a pixilated, hyperactive slumber. With its grandeur and its horrific, exhilarating magic realism, ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' jolts us awake (Scott).</p>
        <p>''CAPTAIN CORELLI'S MANDOLIN,'' starring Nicolas Cage, Penélope Cruz, John Hurt, Irene Papas and Christian Bale. Directed by John Madden (R, 120 minutes). The movie's Greek island setting may be gorgeous, but the screen adaptation of a much-loved novel by Louis de Bernières is wooden and mechanical. If you imagined that an epic story set in World War II and involving battles, an earthquake and heroic self-sacrifice couldn't be dull, think again. Mr. Cage is a happy opera-loving Italian army captain, Mr. Bale a fisherman who becomes a fierce Greek partisan and Ms. Cruz the doctor's daughter they both love. Hear the actors struggle with adopted foreign accents and feel their lack of romantic chemistry (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''THE DEEP END,'' starring Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan Tucker and Josh Lucas. Written and directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel (R, 99 minutes). In this tidy and sophisticated film noir, Mr. Lucas plays Darby, who is brazen, magnetic and ruthless and comes to an early end. A woman named Margaret (Ms. Swinton) becomes enmeshed in a murder involving Darby and his latest target: Margaret's 17-year-old child, Beau (Mr. Tucker). Margaret has to handle things on her own, because her husband, a naval officer, is away. She does whatever it takes to keep her boy safe from the clutches of the law and the thugs who were part of Darby's circle. ''The Deep End'' is fastidious and smart, and Ms. Swinton's fixated intensity isn't ever remote; we're always aware of how deeply she's feeling. Her work is magnificent, an actress burrowing inside herself to play a woman doing the most horrible thing in the world to restore order to her life (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH,'' written, directed by and starring John Cameron Mitchell, with songs by Stephen Trask (R, 91 minutes). Mr. Mitchell's Off Broadway ''post-punk, neo-glam rock musical'' about the travails of an East German-born transsexual rock singer on the road in America has been adapted into a wildly funny and innovative film that is even more groundbreaking in its way than ''Moulin Rouge.'' Mr. Mitchell's glamorous title character exudes a Marlene Dietrich-like hauteur, while Mr. Trask's meaty score augments David Bowie's grandiose early-70's rock style with punk-rock attitude and witty lyrics inspired by (of all things) Plato's ''Symposium.'' Smart, surreal and subversive (Holden).</p>
        <p>''MADE,'' starring Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Peter Falk. Written and directed by Mr. Favreau (R, 95 minutes). Who knew that the ''Swingers'' writer and co-star Jon Favreau wanted to be John Cassavetes? His directorial debut -- of which he is also the writer and the co-star -- is a lowlife comedy-melodrama that pushes through to the other side. Mr. Vaughn, his ''Swingers'' co-star, does a real-life version of his bouncing boy-chick from that hit; here, he plays a would-be hipster with echolalia. Bobby (Mr. Favreau), a failing boxer with more heart than brains, drags his loser buddy, Ricky (Mr. Vaughn), along from Los Angeles to New York to do some work for a mob fixer (Mr. Falk). They leave a trail of apologies and screw-ups in their wake. It's often funny, thanks to Mr. Falk, Sean Combs and a series of cameos. But Mr. Favreau may have taken on too much; he might have been better off behind the camera (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''ORIGINAL SIN,'' starring Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson. Directed by Michael Cristofer (R, 110 minutes). Despite the moments of hilarity cobbled together for this film's trailer, which takes the exaggerated voluptuousness of its stars -- Mr. Banderas, with his Iberian good looks and musical delivery, and Ms. Jolie with her fearless avidity -- this remake of ''Mississippi Mermaid'' is a drag. The most original thing about it is the audacity it took to use the word ''original'' in the title. Mr. Banderas is a worldly coffee plantation owner in 19th-century Cuba who discovers his naïveté after Ms. Jolie -- whom he actually gets to call shameless -- hoodwinks him in the game of love. Spiritually and financially bankrupt, he chases her. Every single incident is overdramatized, and the whole thing, filmed by the talented cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, has been lighted like the lobby of a Philippe Starck hotel (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE OTHERS,'' starring Nicole Kidman, Alakina Mann and James Bentley. Written and directed by Alejandro Amenábar (PG-13, 104 minutes). At 29, Mr. Amenábar, a Spanish filmmaker directing his first English-language movie, shows an impressive mastery of the ghost-story form. He sends his camera down shadowy corridors and into cavernous rooms to create a mood of elegant dread. Though a bit too long, and too cluttered in the middle, ''The Others'' is persuasively spooky, and even manages to be poignant, thanks to a fierce performance by Ms. Kidman. She plays a woman living with her two children and three peculiar servants in a fog-shrouded house on the island of Jersey, in the English Channel (Scott).</p>
        <p>''PLANET OF THE APES,'' starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Clarke Duncan. Directed by Tim Burton (PG-13, 125 minutes). This is a reimagining of the original B picture with a few touches of wit, and even fewer touches of imagination. The film lacks the Ugly American forthrightness of the original star, Charlton Heston. Asexual and loud, the new film has been reconfigured for 6-year-olds with an ending that's really surprising. (It doesn't make any sense.) Mr. Wahlberg is the hero this time, an American astronaut who's flung through a wormhole and crash-lands on a world where apes rule. Polite and steely, he is simply cast as the good guy instead of fulfilling the role. In Mr. Burton's new version, the apes don't bounce like marionettes; they're proud to be apes, and in the scary battle scenes, they charge across a field like thundering primates. This stampede of hairy cannonballs is a bad dream come to life. Ms. Bonham Carter is an ape with sympathies for mistreated humans, and she uses her voice resourcefully. But the movie belongs to Mr. Roth, as the preening, ambitious General Thade, so much so that he even gets the best makeup job (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PRINCESS DIARIES,'' starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. Directed by Garry Marshall (G, 115 minutes). This film is another mild Marshall high-concept fable, like ''Pretty Woman,'' in which Julia Roberts, playing a hooker, discovers a pot of gold at the end of her bed. The plot of ''Princess'' is based on a lightning-strikes idea reduced to the voltage of a firefly. Mia (Ms. Hathaway), an awkward 15-year-old in San Francisco, discovers that she is actually a princess. It would be wish-fulfillment for most girls, except that her dream is to be invisible. Clarisse (Ms. Andrews), the grandmother she has never known, turns out to be the queen of Genovia, which from the look of things in this blandly reassuring comedy, must be a small principality just outside Brentwood (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''RAT RACE'' starring John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Jon Lovitz, Lanai Chapman and Rowan Atkinson. Directed by Jerry Zucker (PG-13, 112 minutes). A wealthy, thrill-addicted casino owner (Mr. Cleese) contrives a race from Nevada to New Mexico with a $2 million prize. The hand-picked, scrambling contestants include a pair of inept, scuffling brothers (Mr. Green and Mr. Vieluf); a mother (Ms. Goldberg) and daughter (Ms. Chapman), reunited after years without contact; and a humiliated N.F.L. referee (Mr. Gooding). ''Rat Race'' crams much antic activity into its meager story line, much of it lifted from other movies. The script is unashamed about stooping into any sewer for laughs. The premise of the contest produces so much anxiety that Mr. Zucker's Zenlike direction can't help but make you feel uneasy (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''RUSH HOUR 2,'' starring Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker and Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 88 minutes). This rushed hour and a half passes pleasantly enough, in spite of an incoherent plot (something to do with international counterfeiting) and so-so action sequences. Once again Mr. Chan and Mr. Tucker play a mismatched pair of policemen, and each performer does what he is famous for: Mr. Chan performs acrobatic martial-arts stunts, and Mr. Tucker runs his mouth. As usual the best stuff comes in the blooper reel that plays alongside the final credits, and for some reason the scowly and diminutive Ms. Zhang, in a completely inexplicable role, moves audiences (and this critic) to uncontrollable laughter every time she kicks Mr. Tucker in the face (Scott).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''HOLLYWOOD ON THE HOME FRONT: AMERICAN FILM IN THE 1940's.'' Stretching from Casablanca to Xanadu and stopping in many a town in between, a wide-ranging, two-month series is examining America's filmmaking response to the upheaval of the 1940's, when World War II and its aftermath transformed national life. Consisting of film noir and of movies that address social problems like alcoholism, racism and political corruption, ''Hollywood on the Home Front'' also spoofs and satirizes life in these United States. Many of the 32 films in the series at the American Museum of the Moving Image are recently restored 35-millimeter prints from archives and studios like the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art and Universal Pictures. This weekend's attractions range from a musical that captivated wartime audiences and a romance to two views of politics. At 2 p.m. tomorrow, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien star in Vincente Minnelli's musical ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944), and at 4:30 Garland returns, co-starring with Robert Walker in another Minnelli film, ''The Clock,'' about a whirlwind romance between an office worker and a soldier. On Sunday, politics holds sway, first at 2 p.m. with Robert Rossen's Oscar-winning ''All the King's Men'' (1949), starring Broderick Crawford as a charismatic Southern politician based on Huey Long. At 4 p.m., William Powell plays a not-so-bright senator with his eyes set on the White House in George F. Kaufman's sole directorial effort, ''The Senator Was Indiscreet'' (1947). The series continues through Sept. 9 at the museum, 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens. Admission is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for 65+ and students with I.D., $4.50 for children from 5 to 18 and free to children under 4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
