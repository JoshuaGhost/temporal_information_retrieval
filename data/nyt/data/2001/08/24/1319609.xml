        <p>The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy said yesterday that it would reopen the bidding for the media planning and buying duties for its antidrug campaign.</p>
        <p>Those duties have been handled since December 1998 by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. Annual spending on the account, with creative assignments handled by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, was estimated at $160 million.</p>

        <p>The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy said yesterday that it would reopen the bidding for the media planning and buying duties for its antidrug campaign.</p>
        <p>Those duties have been handled since December 1998 by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. Annual spending on the account, with creative assignments handled by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, was estimated at $160 million.</p>
        <p>Ogilvy is facing a criminal and civil inquiry by the Justice Department into reports that it overbilled the drug control office.</p>
        <p>Ogilvy is in the third year of a contract to handle the media duties, which could have been extended two more years.</p>
        <p>Paul Clark, a spokesman for Ogilvy, would not say whether the agency would take part in the rebidding. In a statement, Ogilvy attributed the rebidding to ''intense pressure brought by Congress'' to dismiss Ogilvy after the agency's billing procedures were questioned.</p>
