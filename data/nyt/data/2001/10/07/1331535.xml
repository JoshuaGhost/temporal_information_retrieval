        <p>Re ''Village Tallies a Loss Beyond a Good Meal,'' [Sept. 30]: My husband and I vividly remember the opening of Millie's Place 25 years ago. Great Neck finally had an upscale, New York City-type restaurant. There was no other place to have lunch, meet a friend for a drink after work, or give our children's showers and receptions and celebratory brunches. Although I loved walking the three blocks to Millie's, as before we will still patronize her and just get in the car and drive the three miles to her Manhasset restaurant. But for the landlord who failed to negotiate for a settlement that would have kept Millie Gubbins on Middle Neck Road, I hope the space goes vacant for years and he loses a lot of income.</p>
