        <p>Within a week of making furtive entry back into Afghanistan, Abdul Haq, a former guerrilla commander who was seen by some American officials as the potential leader of an anti-Taliban uprising, was caught and executed, his Taliban captors said today.</p>
        <p>''We have killed Abdul Haq and two others who were with him, based on an edict that declares death to anyone who assists the United States in its war on the Afghan people,'' said Abdul Himat Hannan, a spokesman for the Taliban's information ministry.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Within a week of making furtive entry back into Afghanistan, Abdul Haq, a former guerrilla commander who was seen by some American officials as the potential leader of an anti-Taliban uprising, was caught and executed, his Taliban captors said today.</p>
        <p>''We have killed Abdul Haq and two others who were with him, based on an edict that declares death to anyone who assists the United States in its war on the Afghan people,'' said Abdul Himat Hannan, a spokesman for the Taliban's information ministry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haq's death is another setback for the American antiterrorism campaign, which has yet to provide Afghanistan's disaffected with an adequate alternative.</p>
        <p>Details about the summary execution of Mr. Haq, 43, who lost a foot  while fighting the Soviet occupation in the 1980's, were sketchy and conflicting, just as were the particulars of any plan that involved him in fomenting a rebellion.</p>
        <p>But it seems that Mr. Haq had enough influence in the United States to spur an American attempt to assist him, possibly by sending in aircraft and a bombing raid. While surrounded, Mr. Haq pressed for and received some desperate help from one of his friends in high places, Robert C. McFarlane, who was national security adviser under President Reagan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haq was an ethnic Pashtun, as are most of the radical Islamic Taliban government. He was seen by some in Washington as someone who might have been able to wrench the support of tribal elders away from the hard-line Muslim militia. The Bush administration is still searching for some sort of southern, Pashtun counterpart to the Northern Alliance, the main opposition group in Afghanistan and one dominated by ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and others.</p>
        <p>Without such a coordinated Pashtun opposition, it will be harder to oust the Taliban and to achieve the American aim of installing a stable government representing a broad array of Afghanistan's factions and ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>In the last two months, the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, have succeeded in killing both Mr. Haq and Ahmad Shah Massoud, the charismatic military leader of the Northern Alliance. The Taliban is proving resilient.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haq had portrayed himself as somebody able to lead Pashtun opposition to the Taliban. A man of balding head and burly physique, he recently returned to the Pakistani city of Peshawar, near the Afghanistan border, from his exile home in Dubai, where he was a businessman. He told reporters -- often as many of them as he could find -- that he knew dozens of leaders in Afghanistan who were ready to overthrow the Taliban on his say-so. They were awaiting his first move, and he was awaiting the right moment, he said.</p>
        <p>But after Oct. 7, the day air attacks on Afghanistan began, his confidence seemed to erode. He said that the bombing was a terrible mistake, that it was rallying Afghans around the besieged Taliban. Last Sunday, he secretly crossed the border into Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>With him were only 19 comrades, according to Joseph C. Ritchie, a wealthy American businessman who grew up in Afghanistan and has since become one of Mr. Haq's patrons.</p>
        <p>The group was carrying only a few automatic weapons, some rifles and a pistol, Mr. Ritchie said in a telephone interview. They did not want extra burdens to compromise their stealth. The plan was to sneak in more arms later or find caches already there.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, in one of several exultant pronouncements from the Taliban, its intelligence chief, Qari Ahmadullah, told the Afghan Islamic Press, a Pakistan-based news service, that his agents had been watching Mr. Haq's every move since he came to Peshawar.</p>
        <p>''We have set up an elaborate spying system in every district and province and no opponent can escape that,'' he said. ''When Abdul Haq entered Afghanistan, we arrested him.''</p>
        <p>Other accounts made the capture seem more chancy. Bakhtar, the Taliban's news agency, said villagers in the Azra district of Logar Province, only 20 miles west of Pakistan's northwestern frontier, had tipped off intelligence agents.</p>
        <p>Later, Taliban troops cornered Mr.  Haq and the others in a gunfight. It seems that two satellite telephones, a large amount of American dollars and unspecified documents were taken from his entourage..</p>
        <p>''At the same time Abdul Haq was captured, one jet and two helicopters came to try to help him, but they failed,'' the Taliban agency said, without identifying where those aircraft came from. The Pentagon did not comment on any attempted rescue of Mr. Haq.</p>
        <p>In yet another version, supplied by Mr. Hannan of the information ministry, the helicopters fired rockets, trying to assist the commander in a last-gasp escape at 2:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>Those tactics did permit several Americans accompanying him to evade capture, he said. It was not clear who those Americans might be or whether they existed. Eight other Afghans have been taken prisoner, Mr. Hannan said.</p>
        <p>Even outside the Taliban, Mr. Haq had his detractors. He himself often complained that he was not being taken seriously by the American and Pakistani intelligence agencies, though on occasion, some of his supporters at least made the pretense that things were otherwise.</p>
        <p>Today, a Pakistani intelligence agent, declining to be identified, said: ''This was not our operation.  We were never privy to the details.''</p>
        <p>He referred to Mr. Haq as ''cocky'' and said he was overly interested in public relations.</p>
        <p>Al Santoli, the top defense aide to Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican who is a leading supporter in Congress of a post-Taliban coalition government, was similarly critical. ''Abdul Haq was bogus,'' he said. ''He didn't have support of his peers.''</p>
        <p>While toppling the Taliban has proved difficult, so has been the task of forging a unified opposition to replace them. The so-called Northern Alliance is actually made up of very few allies and is especially short on ethnic Pashtuns, who make up perhaps 50 percent of Afghanistan's population. So far, the most promising rallying point seems to be the former king, 87-year-old Mohammed Zahir Shah, dethroned in 1973 and living in exile in Rome.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haq, like most others leaders opposing the Taliban, spoke respectfully of the king, suggesting he was the one person who could bring the fractured nation together.</p>
        <p>Mostapha Zahir, the former king's grandson and chief spokesman, lamented Mr. Haq's death. ''Afghanistan has lost one of its finest and greatest sons, and I and my family have lost a great friend,'' he said in Rome.</p>
        <p>Rassoul, private secretary to Zahir Shah, told Agence France-Presse that Mr. Haq ''was very close to us'' and that he had gone to Afghanistan ''to contact the tribes and to gather them around a peace plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haq was a member of the Ahmadzais, one of the nation's largest tribes. It was natural for him to attempt to find support in southwest Nangahar Province and northeast Logar Province, the areas where he had taken his small brigade, according to Daud Arsala, one of his younger brothers.</p>
        <p>''He was entirely on a mission of peace,'' he said. ''Haq was always on good terms with all the people of Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance, the Taliban, the political parties: he never said a bad word about anyone.''</p>
        <p>During the early hours of this evening, Mr. Arsala and others at the Peshawar headquarters were still holding out hope that their leader was alive. But by 10 p.m., the confirmation of his death had come from friends inside Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>''The commander was hanged and then his body was sprayed with bullets,'' said Yusuf Safi, a family spokesman. He said the execution had taken place in Rishkor, near Kabul.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Safi, one other man was executed, whom he identified as Jhagran Hamid, a friend of Mr. Haq's. Earlier, Taliban sources said two others were put to death: Izzatullah, a nephew of the commander's, and Haji Doran, another commander from the campaign against the Soviets. The executions were said to have occurred shortly after noon.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Afghan Islamic Press reported, the air waves in the area crackled with congratulations as Taliban commanders passed along their glad tidings.</p>
