        <p>This is how Richard Fitzgerald, a private chauffeur who lives in Greenwich Village, described his feelings about some of the mayoral candidates in late August, three weeks before the scheduled primary: ''I like Mark Green the best. He is sort of a voice for the people.'' And on Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate: ''I think he's paying his place on the ticket. I don't think he's earned a place in politics.''</p>
        <p>This is what Richard Fitzgerald says now, three weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center: ''I think Bloomberg may be tougher on terrorists right now. Being that he is a real businessman, I think he is the one to protect and rebuild this city. I've become selfish, I know, but I don't want to die in this city because of a crazy terrorist.''</p>

        <p>This is how Richard Fitzgerald, a private chauffeur who lives in Greenwich Village, described his feelings about some of the mayoral candidates in late August, three weeks before the scheduled primary: ''I like Mark Green the best. He is sort of a voice for the people.'' And on Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate: ''I think he's paying his place on the ticket. I don't think he's earned a place in politics.''</p>
        <p>This is what Richard Fitzgerald says now, three weeks after the attack on the World Trade Center: ''I think Bloomberg may be tougher on terrorists right now. Being that he is a real businessman, I think he is the one to protect and rebuild this city. I've become selfish, I know, but I don't want to die in this city because of a crazy terrorist.''</p>
        <p>And so it goes. A week before a Democratic runoff that will pit Mr. Green against Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, there is much soul-searching and hand-wringing in Greenwich Village, SoHo, TriBeCa, Chelsea and Battery Park City -- overwhelmingly white, mostly middle-class neighborhoods that make up the 66th Assembly District.</p>
        <p>It is not the first time that voters in this district, a Democratic stronghold, are reacting to political events in unexpected ways. In 1997, more than half voted for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, even though four years earlier the majority of them had flatly rejected him. Now, with thousands of bodies entombed in the rubble of the World Trade Center a few blocks from their homes, voters in this district may be gearing up to help rearrange the city's political map once again.</p>
        <p>Some voters who used to despise Mr. Giuliani -- who has said he would like to extend his term by three months -- now love him for his command of the city after the collapse of the twin towers. Some who voted for Mr. Green in the primary are ditching him for Mr. Ferrer because they like how Mr. Ferrer stood up to Mr. Giuliani's pressures to prolong his mandate. And still others, like Mr. Fitzgerald, who had rarely ever voted Republican, are inclined to vote for Mr. Bloomberg because, they say, he is the only one with the business experience to resurrect Lower Manhattan from the ashes.</p>
        <p>''I have been exposed to Bloomberg because my boss is very big in the city,'' said Mr. Fitzgerald, who declined to identify his boss other than to say he is a billionaire who often has private chats with the city's movers and shakers from the back of his car. ''I meet and drive a lot of powerful men, and they talk. You always pretend not to hear, not to pay attention, but you can't help it.''</p>
        <p>And what Mr. Fitzgerald has heard, he said, has made him think Mr. Bloomberg should be mayor.</p>
        <p>''We need to focus on rebuilding the city, not on helping the poor people,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''The bombing completely changed everything. But I can't say what I'll do, for sure, until I get into the booth again.''</p>
        <p>Louis K. Meisel, a SoHo art dealer and historian, knows just what he will do once inside the voting booth. He has made up his mind to vote for Mr. Bloomberg, even though, in the primary, he voted for Mr. Green.</p>
        <p>''The priority now is rebuilding and putting the city back together,'' he said. ''We need a Republican and a businessman to run the city, someone who won't bow down to the demands of every single ethnic and political group complaining that they are being excluded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meisel, who has lived in New York for all but 8 of his 59 years, says he is a registered Democrat who voted twice for Mr. Giuliani but now wants to see him go.</p>
        <p>''When I heard he wanted to stay, I thought about it for a while,'' he said. ''But you know what? His time's up. It's the rule of the people, and term limits should stand. There are other people who are capable of running the city of New York.''</p>
        <p>Few neighborhoods benefited more from the quality-of-life improvements during the eight years of the Giuliani administration than those in the 66th Assembly District. Home to dozens of art galleries, trendy restaurants, popular parks and quaint shops, the area thrived during the Giuliani years, when shoppers and tourists felt it was safe to be out at night.</p>
        <p>Marianne Salerno, a 60-year-old medical assistant who has lived in the West Village for 50 years, remembers the time when sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park was considered risky. Now, children play in the park's playground while their parents read magazines, glancing up only occasionally to check on them.</p>
        <p>''And it is all because of Giuliani,'' said Ms. Salerno. ''I don't say so because I'm Italian; that has nothing to do with it. It's because he is a great mayor.''</p>
        <p>The day of the primary, Ms. Salerno, a Republican who often votes for Democrats, wrote Mr. Giuliani's name on the ballot, even though she favored Mr. Green.</p>
        <p>But now, she will vote for Mr. Green. Ms. Salerno says she is opposed to Mr. Ferrer because he has the support of the Rev. Al Sharpton, whom she dislikes. She also disapproves of Mr. Ferrer's refusal to allow Mr. Giuliani a chance to stay on as mayor for three more months.</p>
        <p>''How can Ferrer not give Giuliani three months?'' she said. ''He deserves at least three more months. If I were in charge I would change the Constitution and have him stay forever.''</p>
        <p>Ruth A. Peltason, 45, a book editor who lives on Barrow Street in the Village, said that she, too, could not understand why Mr. Ferrer turned down Mr. Giuliani's request. And she said she was shocked when Mr. Ferrer attempted to use his experiences in rebuilding the Bronx to try to persuade voters that he was the best candidate to rebuild Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''When I heard him say that, I thought, 'Buddy, you are wrong,' '' she said. ''This is so big you can't possibly compare the two.''</p>
        <p>She decided to vote for Mr. Green in the runoff. Then, when former mayor Edward I. Koch endorsed Mr. Ferrer on Tuesday, Ms. Peltason thought again about her choices.</p>
        <p>''Koch's decision did give me pause,'' she said. ''I was very pro-Koch, but, you know what, this is bigger than Koch too.''</p>
        <p>In the end, though, it was Mr. Green's agreeing to share power with Mr. Giuliani for a few months that convinced her she had picked the right candidate.</p>
        <p>''Oprah Winfrey called him the mayor of the United States,'' she said, speaking of Mr. Giuliani. ''For Ferrer to say, in essence, 'I don't need the guy' was not politically smart. You never kick out a favorite.''</p>
        <p>That's precisely what cemented Paul Monahan's favorable opinion of Mr. Ferrer. Mr. Monahan, a 41-year-old independent contractor who has lived in the West Village for 12 years, said he voted for Mr. Ferrer in the primary for no specific reason. It was more of a ''gut feeling,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I don't like Mark Green,'' he said. ''There is just something about him. I don't know what it is because I know he is a dedicated public servant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Monahan became convinced that he had made the right choice after Mr. Ferrer turned Mr. Giuliani down.</p>
        <p>''I think at first I didn't like Ferrer's saying no to Giuliani,'' he said. ''It seemed so cold and blunt. But he was the only one who saw through the whole thing and had it right from the beginning.</p>
        <p>''See, the terrorists win, the more we change,'' he explained. ''So we shouldn't change. We are bigger than that. We are supposed to get a new mayor, so let's go elect a new mayor.''</p>
