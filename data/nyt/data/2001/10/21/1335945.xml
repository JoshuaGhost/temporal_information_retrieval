        <p>Four terrorists convicted last spring of conspiring with Osama bin Laden in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in Africa were sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan to life in prison without any chance of release. Two -- Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, who assisted in the bombing in Kenya, and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 28, who helped in preparing the attack in Tanzania -- had earlier avoided the death penalty when the jury did not unanimously vote for execution. The two others were Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, and Wadih El-Hage, 41.</p>
