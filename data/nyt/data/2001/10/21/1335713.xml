        <p>The Town of Riverhead last week sold nearly 500 acres in the industrial core of the former Grumman property in Calverton to an East Meadow real estate developer.</p>
        <p>The $17 million sale, negotiated over 18 months, was the first major land sale for the 2,900-acre property, which the Navy gave to the town in 1998.</p>
        <p>The buyer, Jan Burman, said he would seek town approval to subdivide the acreage into about 40 parcels for resale to industrial and commercial users. His land includes 900,000 square feet of indoor space and two major buildings where the former Grumman Corporation once assembled military aircraft.</p>
        <p>The Riverhead supervisor, Robert F. Kozakiewicz, said the town would ''benefit greatly by the sale of this property.'' He said local officials would now turn to other proposals for the remaining 2,400 acres, including a 510-megawatt gas-powered electric generating plant, a water park, an automobile racetrack, golf courses and a polo center. Mr. Kozakiewicz and some other town officials are also considering a town-operated airfield on the site, which has two large runways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kozakiewicz said the $17 million sale to Mr. Burman eased financial pressures on the town to move quickly on other proposals. ''Now that the industrial core property has been sold, we have an opportunity for the town to take a deep breath,'' he said in a news release issued by the town.</p>
