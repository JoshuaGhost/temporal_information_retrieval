        <p>Sept 11 terrorist attacks in United States have forced Irish Republican Army to press for peace in Northern Ireland to avoid being labeled global terrorists; experts cite threat of drop in Irish-American support for Sein Fein, IRA's political wing, as key factor; Sinn Fein plans to donate money raised at its annual New York City fund-raiser to city construction workers' union for distribution to families of World Trade Center attack victims (M)</p>

        <p>THE pieces were already falling into place for Northern Ireland, however tentatively, last summer. It was then that the mostly Catholic Irish Republican Army, in a stunning break with its own history, proposed to begin dismantling its arsenal of weapons and bombs in order, it said, to restore life to the dying peace process.</p>
        <p>As so often happens in the push-me-pull-you politics of Northern Ireland, the I.R.A.'s mostly Protestant antagonists swiftly denounced the plan as an empty gesture, and the republicans withdrew their offer. It looked as if peace remained as elusive as ever.</p>
        <p>That all changed with the Sept. 11 attacks, when the I.R.A.'s position around the world, and particularly in the United States -- for which it depends on much of its psychic, political and financial support -- altered in a flash.</p>
        <p>''With Sept. 11 and the war on terrorism, these people fighting for their freedom  in Northern Ireland ran the real risk of being labeled global terrorists,'' said William J. Flynn, a prominent Irish-American in New York who is chairman of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy.</p>
        <p>''If they didn't decommission, I felt -- and Irish-Americans felt -- that the battle would be totally lost,'' he said. ''It would have set back the move to peace in Northern Ireland by another 30 years. We felt it was the only way forward.''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration -- already furious at the arrest in August of three I.R.A. members who were meeting leftist guerrillas in Colombia -- thought so, too. And  it was clear to Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, which is seeking greater parliamentary representation in the Irish Republic as the country prepares for a general election sometime before next summer, that this was a moment to be seized.</p>
        <p>''This year, in a sense, you've been talking about not if, but when, and Sept. 11 accelerated the process,'' said Sydney Elliott, a senior lecturer in politics at Queens University Belfast.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Elliott said, Sinn Fein was genuinely worried about flagging support in the United States. ''Sinn Fein is one of the wealthiest parties in Europe, and much of the money comes from the United States,'' he said. ''Anything that threatens that source of fund-raising is something which has to be addressed.''</p>
        <p>Pointing to its earlier disarmament proposal, Sinn Fein denied that its actions were explicitly caused by the events in  the United States. ''While the I.R.A.  can sympathize with people in other areas and people in the United States,'' said a Sinn Fein spokesman, speaking on condition that his name not be used, ''they always make their own decisions based on the circumstances that pertain to the struggle in Ireland, and how they're going to move forward the peace process in Ireland.''</p>
        <p>But in a break with usual practice, the money raised at Sinn Fein's big annual fund-raiser -- to be held next week in New York -- will go not to the party, but to the city construction workers' union for distribution to families of victims of the World Trade Center attack. ''Our main support in the U.S. comes from the working class, and construction workers make up a large part of that,'' the spokesman said.</p>
