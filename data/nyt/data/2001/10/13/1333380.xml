        <p>The store's supply was long depleted and there had been one too many calls, so when the phone rang yet again, the pharmacist picked it up and blurted, ''We're out of Cipro!''</p>
        <p>His frustration was but a snippet of the anxiety felt yesterday across the region -- but most acutely in Midtown and the financial district -- as news filtered out that there had been a confirmed case of anthrax in New York City. The news jolted an already sensitive public about biological terrorism, a reaction that city officials tried all day to calm.</p>
        <p>It was to little avail.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon, anthrax scares forced workers from their offices, and companies in the city and the suburbs made emergency adjustments to the way they receive mail, with some cutting off any distribution to employees for the next several days.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki addressed the public several times during the day, urging New Yorkers to remain calm.</p>
        <p>''This is something that is very treatable, so people should not overreact,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''There's no reason to get terribly overwrought over this. Just deal with it.''</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration was so concerned about the public fears that it called all local television affiliates and asked them to put medical experts on the air in their news reports to help calm fears and to stress that anthrax is not contagious.</p>
        <p>But the news that an NBC employee had been exposed to anthrax at Rockefeller Center in Midtown kept many office workers on edge. Throughout the day, there were streams of reports of suspicious letters and packages arriving at offices throughout Manhattan.</p>
        <p>As those reports spread, executives of several companies, including at the Sony Music studios throughout the city and at Viacom in Times Square, decided to close their mailrooms and take special precautions.  At least five companies had scares and evacuations as a result of suspicious material arriving in their offices and mailrooms.</p>
        <p>Reporters from NBC's local affiliate, WNBC-TV, working on a story about the scene outside their own workplace, found themselves being interviewed by other journalists eager to know what things were like inside the building.</p>
        <p>''People are concerned, but there's no panic,'' Rob Morrison, a WNBC reporter and anchor, assured his colleagues and competitors.</p>
        <p>Lee Garrison, a passer-by on the Avenue of the Americas at lunchtime yesterday, who noticed the commotion taking place at NBC, said he was among those concerned about bioterrorism. ''I thought about packing up,'' he said. ''I started getting psychosomatic symptoms, itching and all that. I'm not sure I talked myself out of it.''</p>
        <p>One of the first and most widespread reactions to the disclosure of the anthrax case at NBC was a surge in demand for antibiotics, especially Cipro. Orders for Cipro in New York had been increasing steadily since the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11, but yesterday, it seemed ''the whole general population is going for it, not just the people who are nervous,'' said Dino Papoutsis, a pharmacist at Bigelow's in Greenwich Village, one of the city's largest independent drugstores.</p>
        <p>Peter Capuano, the pharmacist and owner at Greenleaf Pharmacy, in Hastings-on-Hudson in Westchester County, said one customer came in with three prescription slips, each for 120 pills, for a total cost of $1,600.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said at one of his news conferences yesterday that many people were showing up at emergency rooms at city hospitals, just to be tested for anthrax. ''They're concerned and they're alarmed,'' he said. ''But there's really no reason for it at this point.''</p>
        <p>It seemed that media outlets were the ones mostly on guard. Mailroom operations at ABC, CBS, CNN, NY1 and other companies were suspended. The Associated Press, with its headquarters in Rockefeller Center, told staff members that any piece of mail that caused concern should not be opened, and that authorities should be contacted immediately.</p>
        <p>''We've been holding internal briefings for the headquarters staff,'' said Jack Stokes, The A.P.'s media relations manager. ''We're asking people to use common sense and telling them that any questions should be directed to the human resources department or supervisors.''</p>
