      <block class="full_text">
        <p>On Sept. 21, at least 76 families of passengers who died in the four terrorist hijackings of Sept. 11 received packets containing a leatherlike portfolio stuffed with $50 to $200 in cash, prepaid calling cards and the names of four law firms with ''extensive experience in major airline and other similar mass disasters.''</p>
        <p>But the packages were not sent by lawyers. They came from Providence Inc., a Cincinnati company that employs no lawyers and so is not covered by a 1996 federal law that forbids lawyers from approaching the families of air crash victims for 45 days after an accident. Providence, which lends money to plaintiffs in anticipation of awards from a subsequent settlement, says none of the law firms named on its list knew that their names were being distributed.</p>
        <p>The mailings show how difficult it may be for the legal profession to police its image in the aftermath of disasters. But the response to the mailings also shows that many lawyers are intent on doing just that. One lawyer said he had referred the matter to the United States attorney's office in Chicago to determine whether sending the packages violated any federal law, and three law firms threatened to sue to block Providence from using their names.</p>
        <p>Such reactions do not shake John Janis, the director of business development for Providence. To attract borrowers, the company routinely sends similar packets offering loans to families affected by a Job's list of disasters, from factory explosions to bus accidents.</p>
        <p>''If there's someone out there that needs their mortgage paid for, or their surgery paid for, that's what we're here to do,'' Mr. Janis said. In return, he said, his company receives a flat fee or a percentage of any future settlement -- an amount that could substantially exceed the original loan. But if a family receives nothing, Providence is not paid.</p>
        <p>Many lawyers see Providence's activities as contrary to the spirit of the federal antisolicitation law passed in 1996 after the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800. ''This is one of the worst things that any business organization could be sending to these victims,'' said Robert A. Clifford, a Chicago lawyer who is chairman of the American Bar Association's task force on terrorism and the law. ''It does by indirection what lawyers are prevented from doing directly.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence J. Fox, a partner at Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath in Philadelphia and a former chairman of the bar association's ethics committee, said the 1996 law was intended to prevent people who are dealing with grief and who may not be in the best frame of mind to select a lawyer, from being pressed into hiring one.</p>
        <p>But Providence requires that borrowers hire a lawyer before it will lend them any money, Mr. Janis said, adding, ''That way the lawyer looks out for their best interest.''</p>
        <p>Providence also wants to know who that lawyer is so that it can quantify the risk of making a loan: the better the law firm retained, the more likely that it will win and that Providence will be paid.</p>
        <p>The week after the attacks, the company began to send packages to the families of victims whose addresses it could find. Fewer than 200 families received mailings, Mr. Janis said.</p>
        <p>The firms listed in the packet were Waite, Schneider, Bayless &amp; Chesley of Cincinnati; Richardson, Stoops, Richardson &amp; Ward of Tulsa, Okla.; Kreindler &amp; Kreindler of New York; and Speiser, Krause, Nolan &amp; Granito, also of New York.</p>
        <p>Jerome L. Skinner, a partner at Waite, Schneider, spoke to Mr. Janis of Providence after receiving a call from someone who had received one of the company's packages.</p>
        <p>''I confirmed with him that he had not had any prior permissions to use our name,'' Mr. Skinner said, adding that he told Providence to stop including his law firm's name on the list. Mr. Janis said he did not recall Mr. Skinner's making that request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skinner's firm, along with Kreindler and Speiser, had been preparing to sue Providence to force it to stop sending out the packages, but lawyers at all three firms now say that litigation is unlikely because they received a letter of apology from Providence late Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>Richardson, Stoops, which also received an apology, said that it was not aware of the mailing but that, in the past, it had referred a client to Providence.</p>
        <p>And Thomas Demetrio, a Chicago lawyer who represents a widow of a victim, was so incensed that he sent the packet his client received to federal prosecutors in Chicago for scrutiny, he said.</p>
        <p>Such legal action may be moot, however: Providence has already moved on to contact families affected by new disasters, Mr. Janis said.</p>
        <p>''We had an explosion in Alabama that we had to cover and an explosion in Indiana,'' he said. ''And there was a bridge collapse in Texas.''</p>
