        <p>Facing increased demand for services, Sleepy Hollow National Bank has acquired a mortgage company.</p>
        <p>''It's just been building up over the last few years to the point we just had to do something about it,'' said John J. Hughes Jr., the bank's president. The bank received calls every day, he said, for services like home loans that it did not specialize in.</p>
        <p>Last week the bank received federal approval for the acquisition of Sirianni Mortgage Corporation, based in Danbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>The acquisition allows Sleepy Hollow to seek business in the surrounding areas of Rockland County and Connecticut. It also gives the company greater flexibility in what it can offer, like mortgage loans and large-scale business loans, which Sirianni specializes in.</p>
        <p>All of Sirianni's employees will remain in place.</p>
        <p>''We're buying expertise here more than anything else,'' Mr. Hughes said.</p>
