        <p>LOTS of people look through my menu and order the squid pasta. But sometimes diners are surprised to find that the squid is the pasta.</p>
        <p>In this dish, I cut raw squid into strips and score the pieces so they look just like pasta, rigatoni maybe, or shells. Then I sizzle them quickly, so they're tender like pasta, but with a crunchy edge, and toss them with broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and garlic, and a simple sake-soy sauce. Like ridgy rigatoni, they hold on to the sauce, give the dish substance and balance the flavor of the vegetables and the saltiness of the sauce.</p>

        <p>LOTS of people look through my menu and order the squid pasta. But sometimes diners are surprised to find that the squid is the pasta.</p>
        <p>In this dish, I cut raw squid into strips and score the pieces so they look just like pasta, rigatoni maybe, or shells. Then I sizzle them quickly, so they're tender like pasta, but with a crunchy edge, and toss them with broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and garlic, and a simple sake-soy sauce. Like ridgy rigatoni, they hold on to the sauce, give the dish substance and balance the flavor of the vegetables and the saltiness of the sauce.</p>
        <p>The success of this dish depends on understanding the texture of squid or cuttlefish, which can also be used for this recipe. It's something you learn when you study to be a sushi chef in Japan. As part of the training, you're taught the best way to cut each fish depending on how the grain runs. The grain of squid and cuttlefish runs the long way, down the length of the body.</p>
        <p>When you cut it crosswise, the way cooks usually do for squid rings, it can be tough. But if you cut it lengthwise, with the grain, the pieces will curl and stay tender. Scoring the meat with fine, close ribs also helps.</p>
        <p>To make the scoring with a light touch, use a Japanese or Chinese cleaver. But whatever sharp knife you use, be extremely careful not to cut all the way through. Then you'll have noodles, which is also something Japanese chefs sometimes make with squid and cuttlefish. The delicate cutting is a little easier with cuttlefish than with squid because cuttlefish is meatier and you can make the incisions deeper.</p>
        <p>To finish the dish, I like to sprinkle on shichimi togarashi, a common Japanese spice mixture of ground chili pepper, dried orange peel, poppy seeds, white and black sesame seeds, nori and sansho (sansho is like pepper, strong and fragrant). You can use as much as you like. If you can't find it, then grind red and black pepper with sesame seeds and poppy seeds, or try chili powder.</p>
        <p>But don't leave the spices out. We often use shichimi on noodles. Why not on squid pasta? Things that taste a little bland need some snap.</p>
        <p>SQUID PASTA WITH LIGHT GARLIC SAUCE  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>Sea salt</p>
        <p>1 cup broccoli florets in small pieces</p>
        <p>6 ounces cleaned squid (3 medium)</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons sake</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon soy sauce</p>
        <p>1 1/2 tablespoons clarified butter</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>4 large shiitake mushrooms, stems removed</p>
        <p>6 medium-thin asparagus spears, slant-cut in 2-inch pieces</p>
        <p>Shichimi togarashi (Japanese mixed ground spices, sold in Asian stores) to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Bring small saucepan of water to a boil; add pinch of salt. Add broccoli, boil 1 1/2 minutes, drain and transfer to bowl of ice water. Drain and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Pull tentacles from squid and discard or set aside for another use. Use kitchen shears to cut bodies lengthwise. Open squid, rinse, pat dry and place flat on cutting board. Use sharp knife or Japanese or Chinese cleaver to score each piece vertically, making cuts very close together, like ribs on rigatoni, but taking care not to cut completely through squid. Cut squid horizontally in 2-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip parallel to the scoring in half-inch wide pieces. Sprinkle strips with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Mix sake and soy sauce and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Heat butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saut√© until it starts to sizzle and gives off fragrance. Increase heat to high, add mushroom caps top-side down, sear briefly, turn and add squid strips, then asparagus and then broccoli. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir-fry until squid strips start to curl and turn opaque, a minute or so, but are not fully cooked.</p>
        <p>5. Drizzle sake-soy mixture over ingredients, stir and remove pan from heat. Stir again and transfer to serving dish. Sprinkle with shichimi togarashi and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 to 4 servings.</p>
