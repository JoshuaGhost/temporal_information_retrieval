        <p>The last time Curt Schilling faced the Atlanta Braves in the postseason, he set a National League Championship Series record with the Philadelphia Phillies by striking out the first five batters he faced. That was in 1993, and Schilling went on to earn the series' most valuable player award.</p>
        <p>Eight years later, Schilling has added to his postseason reputation as a nearly unbeatable pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He carries three straight complete-game victories in the playoffs into his start Friday night against the Braves and John Burkett in Game 3 of the N.L. Championship Series at Turner Field. The series is tied at 1-1.</p>

        <p>The last time Curt Schilling faced the Atlanta Braves in the postseason, he set a National League Championship Series record with the Philadelphia Phillies by striking out the first five batters he faced. That was in 1993, and Schilling went on to earn the series' most valuable player award.</p>
        <p>Eight years later, Schilling has added to his postseason reputation as a nearly unbeatable pitcher with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He carries three straight complete-game victories in the playoffs into his start Friday night against the Braves and John Burkett in Game 3 of the N.L. Championship Series at Turner Field. The series is tied at 1-1.</p>
        <p>This week Schilling recalled that 1993 performance at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where 62,012 fans watched as he guided the Phillies to victory in that game and then into the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. ''Before that I was a loud nobody,'' he said. ''Then I became a loud somebody.''</p>
        <p>Schilling may be a more complete pitcher, but he still plays at a high volume, and his fastball was clocked at 97 miles an hour in the ninth inning of Game 5 of the division series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Schilling had a rogue group of teammates in 1993, including Mitch Williams, Lenny Dykstra, Darren Daulton and John Kruk.</p>
        <p>''I knew they believed we were going to win when I took the ball,'' Schilling said. ''Until we got into that series and those games happened, I don't know that anybody knew if I could do it when it mattered most.''</p>
        <p>He proved that then and again this season, going 13-1 with a 1.72 earned run average following Arizona losses. He threw a shutout in Game 1 of the division series and a 2-1 victory in the deciding fifth game.</p>
        <p>If the championship series goes its full seven games, Schilling and Randy Johnson, who threw a three-hit shutout in Game 1, are guaranteed of starting a total of four games, meaning the Braves will have to beat one of them at least once to win this series.</p>
        <p>Braves Manager Bobby Cox today played down the notion that Schilling and Johnson were unbeatable.</p>
        <p>''Our players are talking it up real good about winning,'' Cox said, ''so we just have to hope that they make some mistakes and they have to hope that our -- they got to beat our pitchers, too. They got to hope the same thing.''</p>
        <p>The teams split the first two games in Arizona, but the Diamondbacks scored only three runs in the first two games and 11 runs in seven games this postseason.</p>
        <p>Cox was still undecided today about whether he would use a three-man rotation of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Burkett, but indicated he would. Cox says he can do so because his starters have not been forced to throw too many pitches in games. He also considers his bullpen, with the converted starter John Smoltz closing games, the strongest it has been during the Braves' decade-long playoff run, allowing him to ask his starters for just six innings each outing.</p>
        <p>That is enough for Burkett, a 36-year-old right-hander who nearly left baseball last year when the Tampa Bay Devil Rays released him at the end of spring training. Atlanta signed him and this year Burkett produced the lowest E.R.A. (3.04) of any Braves starter, though he was only 12-12.</p>
        <p>''It's unbelievable,'' Burkett said. ''I'm going to be pitching Game 3 now in the N.L.C.S. for the Atlanta Braves. Just two years ago I felt like I was ready to retire.''</p>
        <p>Schilling and Johnson, who is to start Game 5 on Sunday, have no pitch limitations like Atlanta's pitchers. Arizona Manager Bob Brenly, who watched his bullpen allow five runs in the eighth inning Wednesday, will stay with either pitcher as long as he can.</p>
        <p>Schilling won 22 games and Johnson 21 during the regular season, combining to form baseball's most overpowering pitching duo despite starkly different personal approaches.</p>
        <p>''I am an extrovert,'' Schilling said. ''He is an introvert. I think it's almost like when you meet the perfect woman, opposites attract.''</p>
        <p>Schilling has one more goal beyond taking Arizona to the World Series. He was a minor league prospect with the Red Sox when Roger Clemens was pitching in Boston, and he admired Clemens. Schilling wanted to face Clemens in this season's All-Star Game but was unable to start because he pitched two days before the game.</p>
        <p>''I look to the A.L.C.S and I think, 'I hope we can make it out of this and meet up with them in the World Series and possibly get a chance to pitch against him,' '' Schilling said.</p>
