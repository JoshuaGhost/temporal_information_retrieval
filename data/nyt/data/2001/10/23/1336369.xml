        <p>Wayne Korhonen, a psychology teacher at East High School here, came to work today as many Americans do during a time of war, wearing bold symbols of patriotism. A ribbon of red, white and blue was pinned to his lapel. His tie bore a likeness of the Stars and Stripes.</p>
        <p>But as a striking reminder that pain often comes with patriotism, he also wore a black armband, in memory of Specialist Jonn J. Edmunds, a 1999 honors graduate and one of his former students.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Specialist Edmunds and another soldier, Pfc. Kristofer T. Stonesifer of Missoula, Mont., became the first American combat casualties in the war against the Taliban when they were passengers in a Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in Pakistan. Both men served with the 75th Ranger Regiment, based at Fort Benning, Ga.</p>
        <p>A Defense Department official said the crash occurred as the helicopter was landing at Dalbandin air base. The wash of the rotor blades kicked up a huge cloud of dust, the official said, which apparently disoriented the pilot or interfered with the equipment.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the bodies of the two soldiers were flown to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where they received military honors. Today, their families waited to learn from the Army when they could schedule funerals and memorial services. Specialist Edmunds, 20, was married less than a year. Private Stonesifer, 28, was single.</p>
        <p>Outside their modest home on the wind-swept prairie outside Cheyenne, Specialist  Edmunds's parents, Donn and Mary, held back tears as Donn Edmunds read a statement in which he described his son as ''a tough, determined, competitive young man who only accepted the best of himself and wanted to give his best for his country.''</p>
        <p>That his son became an Army Ranger was hardly a surprise to anyone who knew him.</p>
        <p>''When everyone was planning on college, I asked him what college he wanted to go to,'' Mr. Korhonen said, recalling Specialist Edmunds's unwavering sense of purpose. ''He told me he didn't want to go to college; he was joining the Army to be a Ranger.</p>
        <p>''Kids say things like that all the time here, depending on what movie is popular at the time. But with Jonn, I knew there was no doubt.''</p>
        <p>The military has a big presence in Cheyenne, the capital of Wyoming. The area's largest employer is the F. E. Warren Air Force Base, which manages the nation's nuclear arsenal. Sam Mirich, the East High principal, said that many of students were children of military families, and that every year some graduates chose a military career over college or civilian work.</p>
        <p>In Specialist Edmunds's case, he was following family tradition. His father served in the Army in Vietnam. ''Jonn wanted to prove he was as tough physically as he was mentally,'' said Kosta Tsandes, who taught him economics. ''He always tried awfully hard. He didn't have the speed or fluidity as someone with God-given gifts. But he would die out there. He wanted to succeed so bad to prove he was good.''</p>
        <p>Private Stonesifer, who grew up in Doylestown, Pa., and moved to Montana several years ago to attend the University of Montana, was remembered much the same way. A philosophy major with a 3.51 grade point average, he quit the university's  R.O.T.C. program last year because he felt it was not strenuous enough. Then he joined the Army.</p>
        <p>''All I really knew was, he wanted to be the best soldier in the U.S. Army, and the best soldiers in the Army are in the Ranger battalion,'' Lt. Col. Jim Clegg, professor of military science and head of the R.O.T.C. program at Montana, told The Associated Press. ''He was a very mature and focused young man.''</p>
        <p>A classmate of Private Stonesifer in the R.O.T.C. program, Simon Walbruch, 26, was one of the last students from the University of Montana to see him when Mr. Walbruch spent three weeks last summer at the airborne school in Fort Benning, Ga.</p>
        <p>''He seemed really happy,'' Mr. Walbruch said. ''He was really glad he made the decision that he did. I'm sure he was happy to be over there and help defend our country.''</p>
