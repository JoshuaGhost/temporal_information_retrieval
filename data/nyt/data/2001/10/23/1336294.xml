        <p>Legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki agreed today to pay for college scholarships for National Guard members who were denied the aid because the program had run out of money.</p>
        <p>On learning last week that 295 guard members had not received the scholarships they expected, Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said they wanted the state to pay for them.</p>
        <p>But the governor's office wavered, noting that between the recession and the destruction of the World Trade Center, the state faced a multibillion-dollar budget shortfall and that hundreds of programs were vying for the state's limited resources.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Pataki said, ''Maybe there wasn't an absolute legal guarantee that anyone who signed up for the National Guard would be able to get the free tuition, but I believe that we made a moral guarantee.''</p>
        <p>The state budget allocated $3 million for the program, which promises up to $3,400 a year -- full tuition at a State University of New York campus -- to anyone who signs up for the National Guard or Naval Militia, or who extends an enlistment in those services. But this semester, for the first time, more people qualified for the assistance than the program could afford.</p>
        <p>The state, which gave the scholarships to 1,648 students, notified 295 others in early September that they would not receive money. Days later, after the trade center attack, many guard units, including some of those who had members who were denied scholarships, were called to active duty.</p>
        <p>Legislators said they expected to pass a bill this week allocating more than $300,000 to cover the remaining students.</p>
