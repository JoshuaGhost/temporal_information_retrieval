        <p>Directed by Barbara Hammer  Not rated, 65 minutes</p>
        <p>Barbara Hammer has 30 years of lesbian filmmaking behind her, reaching back to the highly experimental (and now somewhat dated) shorts she made in the 1970's, like ''Dyketactics'' and ''Women I Love.'' Influenced by avant-garde filmmakers like Bruce Connor and Stan Brakhage, Ms. Hammer creates nonlinear montage films in which found film clips (old newsreels, classroom films, pornography) and newly shot material (of a documentary or polemical bent) are blended into a joyously disruptive, discontinuous whole.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hammer's new film, ''History Lessons,'' which opens today at the Quad (34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village), adapts those techniques to a mock history of lesbian imagery in film. Some of the clips have been reworked with deliberate blatancy, like the framing device that transforms a newsreel of Eleanor Roosevelt presiding over a wartime meeting of women's group leaders into a lesbian town hall, with a (dubbed) Mrs. Roosevelt loudly proclaiming her right to love whom she likes.</p>

        <p>Barbara Hammer has 30 years of lesbian filmmaking behind her, reaching back to the highly experimental (and now somewhat dated) shorts she made in the 1970's, like ''Dyketactics'' and ''Women I Love.'' Influenced by avant-garde filmmakers like Bruce Connor and Stan Brakhage, Ms. Hammer creates nonlinear montage films in which found film clips (old newsreels, classroom films, pornography) and newly shot material (of a documentary or polemical bent) are blended into a joyously disruptive, discontinuous whole.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hammer's new film, ''History Lessons,'' which opens today at the Quad (34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village), adapts those techniques to a mock history of lesbian imagery in film. Some of the clips have been reworked with deliberate blatancy, like the framing device that transforms a newsreel of Eleanor Roosevelt presiding over a wartime meeting of women's group leaders into a lesbian town hall, with a (dubbed) Mrs. Roosevelt loudly proclaiming her right to love whom she likes.</p>
        <p>Other clips are obviously, disturbingly real, like a 19th-century one that apparently shows a well-dressed young woman being hanged. (We are left to assume that she has committed crimes of sexuality.) Ms. Hammer's aesthetic doesn't allow her to identify her source material, which makes sense on one level (she doesn't want to create the impression of a didactic, scholarly work) but is distracting on another. It would be nice to know, for example, the context of the hanging, as well as many other enigmatic moments in this 65-minute film. Ms. Hammer enjoys the comic effect of cutting between censorious ''social guidance'' films (there's one in which the narrator sternly warns girls against forming ''too close'' friendships) and the forbidden imagery of grainy pornographic films from the same era of women making love.</p>
        <p>She is making a valid point about cultural hypocrisy; what is outlawed in one context is considered acceptable entertainment in another. But she also seems to be celebrating the pornographic images as liberating. That point is a less consensual one; surely Ms. Hammer must realize that these images were created for whooping male audiences at fraternity smokers, not for feminist rallies. By claiming this imagery for gay women, she perhaps hopes to turn a tool of objectification and oppression into a celebratory explosion of female sexuality. Unfortunately the clips themselves are so battered, grainy and sordid that they are more depressing than inspiring.</p>
