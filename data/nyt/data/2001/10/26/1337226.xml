        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which moved to temporary offices in Jersey City after its headquarters at the World Trade Center were destroyed, said yesterday that it would split its nearly 2,000 displaced workers between offices in Manhattan and Newark.</p>
        <p>The agency also said it hoped to return eventually to a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The agency said it signed a 15-year lease on 315,000 square feet of space at 225 and 233 Park Avenue South, two adjoining buildings that fill the block between 18th Street and 19th Street. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Port Authority's chairman, said the buildings would serve as the Port Authority's ''interim headquarters while we formulate our long-term plans.''</p>
        <p>''Our ultimate goal is to reconsolidate the Port Authority's headquarters staff at a single location in Lower Manhattan,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A lease for 140,000 square feet at an undisclosed address near the Park Avenue South headquarters is under negotiation, the agency said. It said that most of its displaced trade center workers, perhaps as many as 1,400, would be assigned to the Manhattan buildings. The agency said it also planned to move its engineering staff to offices in two of the three Gateway towers in downtown Newark. The agency said it had leases pending for 180,000 square feet at the Gateway complex.</p>
        <p>Allen Morrison, a Port Authority spokesman, said last night that it would pay about $27 million a year for the leases signed and under negotiation in Manhattan and Newark, nearly twice the amount it was paying for its offices in the trade center.</p>
        <p>As a provision of its deal this year to lease the World Trade Center for 99 years to a consortium led by the developer Larry A. Silverstein, the Port Authority had insisted on below-market rents for the space it would use for its own staff.</p>
        <p>''In the aftermath of that horrible event, we were thrown into the marketplace,'' said Cherrie Nanninga, the agency's director of real estate, in an interview last night.</p>
        <p>In its new leases, she said, the agency was insisting on the ability to sublease, providing the option of moving to a new headquarters in Lower Manhattan if one is built in less than 15 years.</p>
