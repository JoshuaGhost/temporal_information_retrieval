        <p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 Â— Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, is promoting a food safety expert to be the next chief of the Food and Drug Administration, but the White House has yet to approve him.</p>

        <p>Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, is promoting a food safety expert to be the next chief of the Food and Drug Administration, but the White House has yet to approve him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson's choice for the job is Dr. Lester Crawford, who directs an education and research institute affiliated with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, people familiar with the selection process said. They are unwilling to talk openly about it until they know whether the White House approves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson has not publicly named Dr. Crawford, and Dr. Crawford declined to comment. But in remarks last week to the National Association of Manufacturers, Mr. Thompson said that he had recommended a scientist with ''a great reputation'' for the F.D.A. job, and that the White House was vetting the candidate.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the Bush administration and Congress have been unable to agree on a candidate for commissioner of the food and drug agency, and Mr. Thompson is taking pains to line up support for his candidate on Capitol Hill. He told the manufacturers' group that the two ranking members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions -- Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire -- were ''enthusiastic and supportive'' of his choice.</p>
        <p>''And so all we have to do,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''is get the president to announce it and have the F.B.I. do the background check. And we're confident we'll get it done as quickly as we possibly can.''</p>
        <p>Whether that will happen remains unclear; a White House spokeswoman today declined comment on the selection process. Moreover, as Mr. Thompson noted in his remarks last week, any announcement may take time because the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating last month's terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>Those attacks have heightened concern about bioterrorism, and the government is now planning to augment production of vaccines to protect against possible germ attacks. Because the food and drug agency would be intimately involved in that effort, some say it has become especially important to fill the commissioner's job.</p>
        <p>''In terms of future vaccine development, I think it would be most helpful to have strong leadership at the F.D.A.,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of BIO, the biotechnology industry trade organization.</p>
        <p>In July, the administration suggested Michael Astrue, general counsel for Transkaryotic Therapies, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass., as a possible F.D.A. chief. But seven Democratic senators, led by Mr. Kennedy, objected. In a letter to the president, they said it would be ''unprecedented for the commissioner to be appointed from an agency regulated by the F.D.A.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Crawford, 63, appears to escape that criticism, although consumer safety advocates have complained that his institute, the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, receives too much support from industry. The institute, which is financially independent, was affiliated with Georgetown University until last month, when it moved to Virginia Tech.</p>
        <p>A veterinarian with a degree in pharmacology, Dr. Crawford ran the Food Safety and Inspection Service for the Agriculture Department, and has also been head of the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine at the F.D.A.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crawford has also been executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association, an industry trade group, and has worked for American Cyanamid, a pharmaceutical company.</p>
