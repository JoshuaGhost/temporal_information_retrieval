        <p>German business confidence dropped close to an eight-year low in September, according to the latest monthly survey by the Ifo Institute. The unexpectedly sharp decline of the overall index -- 4.5 points, to 85 -- was second only to November 1973 and was mainly driven by the index's expectations component, which reflected the terrorist attacks on business prospects by falling 5.3 points, to 90.6. The assessment of the current situation fell 3.6 points, to 79.6. The drop in confidence has fueled speculation that the European Central Bank could cut interest rates.</p>
