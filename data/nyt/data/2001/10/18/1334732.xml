        <p>The American Folk Art Museum, near Lincoln Center, has acquired a new facade and incorporated the gift shop that was next door. The redesign was by David van Handle, an architect who once worked with Tod Williams and Billy Tsien. ''Instead of the original large glass window, we decided to break it up into smaller panes -- some of colored glass -- to give the window a quiltlike pattern,'' Mr. van Handle said. The colors were inspired by Shaker paints. Handmade items include ceramics (above) by Jill Rosenwald, with prices ranging from $140 to $180, as well as Shaker-style side chairs ($225) and toy chickens ($25). 2 Lincoln Square (Columbus Avenue at 66th Street).</p>
