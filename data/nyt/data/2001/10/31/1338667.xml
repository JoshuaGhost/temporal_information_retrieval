        <p>Mr. McAuliffe said his party would ''take no chances and make sure that we have a massive get-out-the-vote operation'' in the governor's race. But Mr. McAuliffe and other Democrats gleefully pointed to a new poll released today by Quinnipiac University showing Mr. McGreevey leading Bret D. Schundler, his Republican opponent, by 17 percentage points among likely voters. The telephone poll, conducted Oct. 10 to 15, surveyed 1,140 registered voters and identified 742 of them as likely to go to the polls. The margin of sampling error for likely voters was 4 percent.</p>

        <p>In a signal that Democrats are increasingly confident about winning the New Jersey governor's race, the national party chairman, Terry McAuliffe, campaigned at the State House here today, not for James E. McGreevey, but for three legislative candidates from Mercer County.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe said his party would ''take no chances and make sure that we have a massive get-out-the-vote operation'' in the governor's race. But Mr. McAuliffe and other Democrats gleefully pointed to a new poll released today by Quinnipiac University showing Mr. McGreevey leading Bret D. Schundler, his Republican opponent, by 17 percentage points among likely voters. The telephone poll, conducted Oct. 10 to 15, surveyed 1,140 registered voters and identified 742 of them as likely to go to the polls. The margin of sampling error for likely voters was 4 percent.</p>
        <p>With just one week until Election Day, the results of the poll were clearly discouraging for Mr. Schundler. In recent weeks, his campaign has fired off news releases after every new poll to proclaim that the gap between the candidates was closing. It did not issue any response to the Quinnipiac poll today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler himself tried to laugh off the results. After an anti-tax rally this morning on the steps of the State House, he said, ''I think all those people who want lower taxes, if they want them you better get out there and vote for me, because we need your support.''</p>
        <p>Pressed about the 17-point margin, Mr. Schundler said, ''I think, everybody, you better vote twice then, maybe voting once won't be enough, so you better vote early and often.'' Then, sounding optimistic, he added, ''It just shows that we have got to have more people vote for me on Election Day, and then we'll still be able to win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler's aides said today that he expected to get a lift from a letter by President Bush that is to be mailed to 600,000 New Jersey voters. Mr. Schundler had hoped that Mr. Bush would visit New Jersey to campaign with him, but the White House has avoided political events to maintain bipartisan support for the war on terrorism.</p>
        <p>''Bret has laid out a positive agenda to cut property taxes, improve New Jersey schools and revive the economy in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area,'' Mr. Bush's letter said. ''I know Bret Schundler can do all of these things because of his outstanding work as mayor of Jersey City.''</p>
        <p>The Schundler campaign also released a new 30-second television advertisement featuring Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York. ''In this crisis, New Jersey just can't afford to raise taxes,'' Mr. Giuliani says in the ad. ''Now more than ever, you need a proven leader who will protect jobs and keep families safe. You need my friend Bret Schundler.''</p>
        <p>The ad also seeks to combat one of Mr. McGreevey's most damaging attacks on Mr. Schundler throughout the campaign -- the assertion that he supports a law that would legalize concealed weapons. ''And I'll tell you this,'' Mr. Guiliani says in the ad, ''Bret will not change current gun laws -- he never wanted to.''</p>
        <p>The Republican National Committee today began a nearly $1 million television advertising campaign for the final week of the race. The ad supports all Republican candidates in New Jersey and does not mention Mr. Schundler by name.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe, the Democratic national chairman, said the effort by national Republicans was coming too late. ''They know they can't win the governorship,'' he said. ''They are worried about the Senate and the Assembly.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Mr. McGreevey  picked up the endorsement of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, an influential group that represents some 600 churches. In 1997, the council endorsed Gov. Christie Whitman over Mr. McGreevey, and it had hesitated to endorse Mr. McGreevey this year because of differences over racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey has voiced support for a law banning profiling, but he has opposed a ban on consent searches by law enforcement officers. Such a ban is a main priority of the ministers council. Nevertheless, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, the group's executive director, said the ministers had decided to endorse Mr. McGreevey. ''Jim McGreevey today is stronger, more prepared and more self-assured than he was four years ago,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Jim McGreevey is up to the task.''</p>
