      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local telephone company, said yesterday that earnings fell 46 percent in the third quarter, to $1.86 billion, or 69 cents a share, from $3.47 billion, or $1.27, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Verizon, which was formed last year by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation, said sales in the quarter had climbed 2.8 percent, to $17 billion. The company's financial performance was hurt by the Sept. 11 attacks, which destroyed switching equipment in Lower Manhattan, and by weaker demand for telephone services.</p>
