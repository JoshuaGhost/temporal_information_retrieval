        <p>Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today that he would probably meet this week with Yasir Arafat, and that he had drafted a new peace plan for the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres said that the meeting with Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, would not be substantive, and that he would present his plan to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon before making its details public. But both developments are likely to deepen the divide between left and right in Israel's coalition government.</p>
        <p>During the present impasse between Israelis and Palestinians, a face-to-face encounter with Mr. Arafat would carry symbolic weight. It would be the highest-level contact in more than a month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres said he was likely to see Mr. Arafat during a conference on Middle Eastern economies to be held on Friday and Saturday on the Spanish island of Majorca.</p>
        <p>''We shall probably meet, but we are not going to negotiate,'' Mr. Peres said, ''because I think that negotiations should be prepared very carefully, otherwise it will create a disappointment instead of a hope.''</p>
        <p>On television tonight, Mr. Peres said that he favored moving immediately to create a Palestinian state and that he had drafted a peace plan. Mr. Sharon has developed his own plan, Mr. Peres said, so he thought it was important for his Labor Party to present an alternative. He insisted that the unity government was ''not speaking with two tongues.''</p>
        <p>The newspaper Maariv reported today that Mr. Peres's plan called for Israel to dismantle its settlements in the Gaza Strip and to permit the founding of a Palestinian state ''for political and not military purposes.''</p>
        <p>Other Labor leaders have proposed ''unilateral disengagement'' by Israel from the West Bank and Gaza, leaving the areas to the supervision of an international coalition.</p>
        <p>Right-wing cabinet members have repeatedly rejected any suggestion of a meeting with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Sharon seemed surprised by the news. Ranaan Gissin, a spokesman for Mr. Sharon, said any such decision must be coordinated between the offices of the foreign minister and the prime minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gissin said Mr. Sharon would consider permitting a meeting if it would help ''in any way to bring about a cessation of hostilities.'' But, he added, ''I think a photo opportunity, even Peres would not go for.''</p>
        <p>The exchange had a familiar ring. Through most of September, Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat planned a meeting that was on and off like a strobe light. Dates were broken as Mr. Sharon insisted on an absolute cessation of violence beforehand.</p>
        <p>Under American pressure, Mr. Sharon relented, and the two men met in the Gaza Strip on Sept. 26 to recommit their two sides to a declared cease-fire. Since then, violence has surged in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
        <p>After the killing on Oct. 17 of Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, Mr. Sharon ordered Mr. Arafat to arrest and turn over those responsible or prepare to be treated as a sponsor of terrorism. Mr. Arafat refused to extradite any suspects, and the Israeli Army seized positions in seven cities in Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank. Israeli soldiers remain in four of those cities.</p>
        <p>The possible meeting comes as some ministers within Mr. Sharon's government have been urging him to banish Mr. Arafat or to undermine his legitimacy as an international figure. Finance Minister Silvan Shalom told Israeli television today that a meeting would signal to world leaders that it was proper to sit down with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''This man generates more terror attacks than the Hamas and Islamic Jihad,'' Mr. Shalom said. ''There is no room for this meeting, nothing will come out of it and, frankly, I do not understand the crazy chase after him every single time. It only hurts us eventually.''</p>
        <p>Israeli leaders are most concerned about the possibility of a meeting between President Bush and Mr. Arafat. Other leaders have shown little reluctance to sit down with the Palestinian leader. Today he met separately in Rome with Pope John Paul II and the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.</p>
        <p>Relations between the United States and Israel have been strained by the Israeli incursions. Today the State Department criticized Israel for the demolition in East Jerusalem of four Palestinian houses. The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, called the demolitions ''highly provocative.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said the owners lacked permits. Palestinians have long accused the Israelis of denying them such permits to push them out of East Jerusalem, which they envision as the capital of their state.</p>
