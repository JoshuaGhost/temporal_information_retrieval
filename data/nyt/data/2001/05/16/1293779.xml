        <p>Albert J. Dunlap directed a huge accounting fraud as chief executive of the Sunbeam Corporation and was aided by a partner of Arthur Andersen, the firm that audited Sunbeam's books, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends in a civil case filed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap, who embraced the nickname Chainsaw Al, became a corporate star in the 1990's, making tens of millions for himself as he laid off thousands of employees in the name of efficiency. Sunbeam's stock leaped nearly 50 percent the day he was hired to run the company in 1996, and his memoirs became a best seller. But the S.E.C. suit, filed in federal court in Miami, said the Sunbeam turnaround directed by Mr. Dunlap was a sham.</p>
        <p>The executives ''orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to create the illusion of a successful restructuring of Sunbeam and facilitate the sale of the company at an inflated price,'' the S.E.C. said.</p>
        <p>''This case is the latest in our ongoing fight against fraudulent earnings-management practices'' that have cost investors billions of dollars, said Richard H. Walker, the commission's director of enforcement.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam, a maker of such products as Sunbeam electric blankets and Oster blenders, is now in bankruptcy reorganization. Without admitting or denying the charges, the company settled related administrative proceedings filed by the S.E.C., accepting a cease-and-desist order barring further violations of securities laws. The S.E.C. did not seek monetary damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap, who was fired from Sunbeam in the summer of 1998, said he would fight the accusations, as did four other former top officials of the company and Phillip E. Harlow, the Andersen partner who was in charge of auditing Sunbeam.</p>
        <p>In a statement released by his lawyer, Mr. Dunlap called the charges ''totally false,'' adding that ''I am outraged that the S.E.C. has chosen to bring these baseless charges against me.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is seeking to bar Mr. Dunlap and his colleagues from serving as officers and directors of publicly traded companies, seeking to  order them not to violate securities laws and seeking to fine them an unspecified amount.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam's fortunes initially seemed to improve under Mr. Dunlap. The company took a huge write-off in 1996 as it closed plants and laid off employees, but its reported profits soared in 1997, persuading many analysts that Mr. Dunlap had turned the company around.</p>
        <p>''We are winning in every aspect of our business,'' Mr. Dunlap told analysts in the conference call announcing 1997 earnings. ''What an amazing year we had.''</p>
        <p>But the recovery was a myth, the S.E.C. said. ''In fact, at least $62 million of Sunbeam's reported $189 million in income for the year did not comply'' with accounting rules, the S.E.C. said in its complaint against Sunbeam.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said that Mr. Dunlap and Russell A. Kersh, then Sunbeam's chief financial officer and a longtime close associate of Mr. Dunlap, used numerous improper tactics to inflate earnings. Millions of dollars in expenses in 1997 were wrongly charged to 1996, when the company had taken the write-off for Mr. Dunlap's reorganization. The S.E.C. said the reorganization created what it called ''cookie jar'' reserves, which could be used to create fake profits in 1997. It also said that Sunbeam unreasonably reduced the value of its inventory so that it could record large profits when the goods were sold.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the S.E.C. said, Sunbeam recorded some sales that were not real, through a variety of methods, and recorded other sales that came from ''channel stuffing,'' putting inventory onto the books of distributors and retailers. In one case, the S.E.C. said, electric blankets that had been packaged for a certain retailer were sent to a distributor who agreed, in return for a guaranteed profit, to hold the blankets until the retailer was ready to accept them. Other sales were made by offering deep discounts to persuade customers to buy merchandise that they would not need for many months. The S.E.C. said that the company should have disclosed those discounts and that the sales should have been recorded in later quarters.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said that some of the fraudulent transactions were uncovered by Mr. Harlow, the Andersen partner, who asked the company to change its financial statements.</p>
        <p>But the company's management refused to make most of the requested changes, and the auditors agreed to certify the financial statements anyway, the S.E.C. said, having been convinced that the challenged numbers, which produced 16 percent of the company's 1997 profits, were not material and therefore did not have to be corrected.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Harlow, the Andersen partner, said his client had acted properly and expected to be cleared. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said it was standing behind Mr. Harlow, the managing partner of its Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office, adding that ''the S.E.C.'s allegations reflect professional disagreements about the application of sophisticated accounting standards'' and ''should not form the basis for allegations of fraud.''</p>
        <p>The 1997 profits reported by Sunbeam at first impressed investors and the board. The stock, which had been at $12.50 the day before Mr. Dunlap's hiring was announced, peaked in early 1998 at $52. At about that time, the board gave Mr. Dunlap a new contract, doubling his base salary to $2 million a year.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam had hired investment bankers to find a buyer for it in 1997, something the S.E.C. said would have enabled Mr. Dunlap to make millions from selling his stock and cashing in his options. But no buyer materialized.</p>
        <p>In early 1998, Sunbeam announced three acquisitions: Coleman, a camping equipment company; First Alert, a smoke-alarm company; and Mr. Coffee, the coffee-pot maker. Coleman was then controlled by Ronald O. Perelman, the financier whose other companies included Revlon, the cosmetics company. Believing that Sunbeam stock would continue to rise, Mr. Perelman agreed to take mostly Sunbeam stock in the deal.</p>
        <p>But the ride was near its end. The company's stock plunged to $34.63, a 25 percent fall, on April 3, 1998, after Sunbeam disclosed that it had lost money in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>By early June, Barron's published an article noting that Sunbeam had negative operating cash flow in 1997 and suggesting that all the company's profits had come from questionable accounting maneuvers. Mr. Dunlap was soon forced to resign after board members began looking into the claims and hearing from employees of questionable accounting practices.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Dunlap's departure, Sunbeam became a disaster for virtually everyone involved. The new chief executive, Jerry W. Levin, failed to turn the company around, and in February it filed for bankruptcy protection. Mr. Levin had been an aide to Mr. Perelman, who has taken large losses on his investment.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Levin called the settlement ''an important milestone'' for Sunbeam and said he was pleased that the matter had been resolved.</p>
        <p>The bankruptcy plan filed by the company, a plan opposed by some creditors, puts the value of the company at $1 billion, or less than the $1.6 billion owed to the company's banks, which have also taken large credit losses. They are led by Bank of America, First Union and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. If the reorganization plan is approved, the bondholders will get nothing.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam's shares still trade, however, and closed yesterday at 7.3 cents, down a tenth of a cent, in over-the-counter trading. They will be worthless if the bankruptcy plan is approved.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Dunlap was fired, Arthur Andersen, along with another accounting firm, reaudited the books and concluded that the 1997 profits should have been far lower. The Andersen spokesman said the firm stands by the re-audit. It has since settled a shareholder class-action suit by agreeing to pay $110 million in damages. That suit against Mr. Dunlap is scheduled for trial in January.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Dunlap was hired by Sunbeam, he was viewed as a corporate star after his tenure at Scott Paper, which was sold to Kimberly-Clark on terms that Mr. Dunlap said provided him with $100 million. The S.E.C. suit does not address Mr. Dunlap's conduct at Scott.</p>
        <p>But the Sunbeam collapse, along with reports that the Sunbeam layoffs were excessive and had damaged the company's ability to do business, damaged his reputation, and he has not been hired as an executive at another company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kersh, the former chief financial officer, said yesterday that he believed that the company's financial statements ''were true and accurate in all material respects and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.'' He called the charges ''totally false.''</p>
        <p>Others named in the complaint were Robert J. Gluck, Sunbeam's former controller; Donald R. Uzzi, the former marketing vice president; and Lee B. Griffith, the former sales vice president. A lawyer for Mr. Gluck said his client's conduct ''was in accord with the law and with accounting standards.'' Lawyers for the other two defendants said their clients were not accountants and knew of no improper accounting.</p>
        <p>The former general counsel of Sunbeam, David C. Fannin, accepted a cease-and-desist order from the commission, which said he participated in the issuance of improper news releases. He did not admit or deny the allegations.</p>
