        <p>Federal prosecutors in the embassy bombings trial said yesterday that they had taken steps to ensure that all necessary documents were provided to defense lawyers. The special care was taken to avoid repeating the problems that led to the postponement of the execution of Timothy J. McVeigh.</p>
        <p>The prosecution statement came as a jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan completed a third full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. Four defendants are on trial in the 1998 bombings of the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
        <p>Two of the defendants, Wadih El-Hage, 40, and Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, 36, face life imprisonment if convicted. The others, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 24, could face execution.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Frederick H. Cohn, a lawyer for Mr. al-'Owhali, cited the F.B.I.'s computer problems and the recent discovery of its failure to turn over more than 3,000 pages of documents to defense lawyers in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation.</p>
        <p>''I am making a demand,'' Mr. Cohn said, ''that if any special search has to be instituted, it should be instituted now for any documents that may not have been turned over to us.''</p>
        <p>A prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, said his office had already made such a request and ''will continue to pursue it, to make sure that whatever occurred in the McVeigh case, if there are any technological glitches, that it doesn't affect the discovery obligations that we believe we have met here.''</p>
        <p>In the embassy bombings trial, prosecutors have turned over thousands of pages of documents from their investigation of the attacks, and of a broader terrorism conspiracy that the government says was led by a Saudi exile, Osama bin Laden.</p>
        <p>In a separate action, Judge Leonard B. Sand quashed a subpoena for Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state whose testimony was being sought by Mr. al-'Owhali's lawyers if a death penalty proceeding becomes necessary.</p>
        <p>The lawyers have said they want to question Dr. Albright about ''her knowledge of the number of Iraqi children dying as a direct consequence of the United States enforcement of United Nations sanctions following the gulf war.''</p>
        <p>David P. Baugh, another of the lawyers, told the judge he wanted to counter the prosecution's argument that Mr. al-'Owhali, in bombing the embassy, showed ''disregard for innocent people who were standing around.''</p>
        <p>A prosecutor, Michael J. Garcia, objected, saying that Mr. Baugh seemed to be trying to hold Dr. Albright ''personally accountable for the actions of the government,'' and that her testimony was not relevant. Judge Sand said he found Mr. Baugh's argument ''totally unpersuasive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. al-'Owhali's lawyers have also asked that if the trial enters a death penalty phase, the judge keep prosecutors from using photographs of victims taken at the blast site and at the morgue in Nairobi. They say the photographs are ''graphic, inflammatory and create unfair prejudice.'' The judge has not ruled on that request.</p>
