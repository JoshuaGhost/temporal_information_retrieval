        <p>New York City Council passes bill that will legalize ferrets as pets but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is expected to veto measure (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Ferrets, rejoice.</p>
        <p>Or at least, breathe what may be a short-lived sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>The New York City Council voted 26 to 13 yesterday, with 7 abstentions, to end the bandit status of the small, furry cousin of the weasel, mink and skunk. But the bill legalizing ferrets as pets failed to pass by a veto-proof margin, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has not been shy about the fact that he is no ferret lover.</p>
        <p>''The fight isn't over,'' said Carol Rainey, a Chelsea filmmaker who owns two ferrets.</p>
        <p>The ferret legalization bill caused an unusually emotional, party-fracturing and, at times, humorous debate yesterday in the Council chambers, which was marked by alternating hissing and applause from Ms. Rainey and about 25 other ferret owners who assembled in the balcony for the show.</p>
        <p>Councilman Noach Dear, an Orthodox Jew and Democrat from Brooklyn, said he could not vote in favor of the legalization of ferrets as pets for a simple reason: he was reminded by his rabbi that they are not kosher.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Una S. T. Clarke and Councilman A. Gifford Miller disagreed over whether rabbits and human babies smell alike, after a suggestion by some opponents of legalization that ferrets were once bred to hunt out and attack bunnies.</p>
        <p>''My baby does not smell like a rabbit,'' said Mr. Miller, a Manhattan Democrat and proud father of a 6-month-old child, evoking an outburst of cheers and applause from the balcony. ''I have no problem then with a ferret spending time with my baby, because he will be safe,'' he added.</p>
        <p>It is unknown how many people illegally own ferrets in the city, where they have been banned as ''wild animals'' since 1959. The animals are said to be legal in 48 states. But it was only after the city's Health Department added them to a list of taboo pets in 1999 that a super-charged ferret legalization movement began.</p>
        <p>No one from the Giuliani administration spoke about the bill yesterday, but the mayor played a critical role in the debate. His staff had lobbied council members one by one and sent out a memorandum titled ''Talking Points Against the Legalization of Ferrets,'' arguing that these animals, like lions, pythons and other banned pets, are ''naturally inclined to do harm.''</p>
        <p>''New York City is not a natural habitat!'' the memo warned. ''It's a place where millions of people live in apartment buildings'' in which the small animals could ''travel through tiny holes in walls'' and get into neighboring apartments where they might cause ''harmful consequences for unsuspecting neighbors.''</p>
        <p>Councilman Thomas V. Ognibene of Queens, the Council's top-ranking Republican, acknowledged that his daughter, who is a veterinarian, advised him that ferrets were no more dangerous than household pets. But he then said that he was voting against the legalization for purely political reasons.</p>
        <p>''I discussed this thoroughly with the people who matter,'' he said, referring to the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>There was no shortage of embarrassment among council members that yesterday's meeting was dominated by the debate over these animals, which originated in Europe and have been domesticated in the United States for about 125 years.</p>
        <p>''It is ridiculous that this Council has had to spend its time on this issue,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But the reason is the administration has gone out of its way to invent a ridiculous policy.''</p>
        <p>But with only 26 votes in favor of the bill -- one more than a majority -- backers will need to find at least 8 more votes if they want to override the expected veto, assuming they can convince the Council leadership to schedule an override vote.</p>
        <p>The lobbying campaign was already being organized late yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Relax tonight,'' said an e-mail message sent out by a group called NYC Ferrets to its members last night. ''But get ready to work hard tomorrow.''</p>
