        <p>Ray Allen quickly hit his first four shots, his silky jumpers pouring through the net as smooth as brandy, a potion that might as well have been cyanide for the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>
        <p>With Allen Iverson hobbling because of a deep bruise beside his tailbone, hitting only air and trying to chase around Allen, his All-Star counterpart, the Milwaukee Bucks overwhelmed the ailing Sixers tonight, 92-78, to even the Eastern Conference finals at 1-1.</p>
        <p>Allen was 7 for 11 on 3-pointers, converting an efficient 15 of 24 shots to score a game-high 38 points.</p>
        <p>As the series headed to Milwaukee, it took a major momentum turn; Iverson's condition worsened while Allen appeared unstoppable for the Bucks, having scored 69 points in the first two games, topping his previous playoff high of 31 he scored in the opener.</p>
        <p>The Sixers desperately need Iverson, their most valuable player, too.</p>
        <p>But after Iverson finished a dreadful 5 for 26 tonight, unable to drive, settling for awkward fadeaways and scoring just 16 points -- 17 below his playoff average -- Sixers Coach Larry Brown said he did not want Iverson to play in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''Oh, he's hurt,'' Brown said. ''I would like him to stay at home tomorrow for practice and miss the next game, but that's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Iverson said it would be a ''long shot'' for him to miss Game 3, but he also expressed some doubt about his game now.</p>
        <p>''If I play, I want to be able to help my team, I don't want to hurt my team,'' he said. ''I've played through injury before, but at some point you got to sit down, you can't play. It's frustrating that it's not getting better.''</p>
        <p>Even if Iverson plays, Allen and the Bucks sense their opportunity. ''Now's the time for taking advantage of his being disabled,'' Allen said. ''I could see he was standing like an old man, holding his back.''</p>
        <p>So Allen burned right by Iverson all night. ''Ray threw a lot of daggers tonight; he made drives, he made some good decisions, he's a marvelous basketball player,'' Bucks Coach George Karl said. ''We needed that and we're going to need it three more times.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, Allen led the Bucks in scoring in every quarter, opening with 13 points and closing with 10. Any time the Sixers crept close, Allen responded crisply with a jump shot, or a fast-break drive, or a fadeaway jumper with two defenders on him.</p>
        <p>''As I was playing, I was making shot after shot, I didn't want to think about what I was doing and slow down and miss shots,'' Allen said. ''If I continue to play the way I play, it's going to be tough.''</p>
        <p>His teammates' contributions were subtle, but significant. Glenn Robinson also hit his first four shots, awakening the Big Dog within, and Sam Cassell made four of his first six shots. The Big Three for Milwaukee combined for 30 of the team's 32 points in the first quarter, shooting a torrid 72 percent. Robinson finished with 16 points, Cassell 14, and the Bucks shot 50.6 percent from the floor.</p>
        <p>When the reserve guard Lindsey Hunter hit the first shot of the second quarter, giving the Bucks a 17-point lead, it was an ominous sign for the Sixers. Hunter had been shooting just 20.5 percent in these playoffs, suffering through what Karl had called a ''mental, physical and spiritual slump.'' Hunter hit his second jumper two minutes later. Slump over. Series tied.</p>
        <p>''I think the series just began,'' Karl said. Dikembe Mutombo and Aaron McKie kept the Sixers from calling it an early night. Mutombo finished with a game-high 20 rebounds and 18 points, dominating the paint. McKie had 14 points in the first half, finishing with a team-high 21.</p>
        <p>They helped Philadelphia come back from a 19-point deficit with 8 minutes 47 seconds left in second quarter, cutting it to 7 points when Mutombo hit two free throws with 1:25 left in the first half. An Ervin Johnson jumper stretched the Bucks; lead back to 9. But the Sixers turned the ball over twice on their next two possessions, sandwiched between Allen's fourth 3-pointer of the first half that gave the Bucks a 12-point lead going into halftime.</p>
        <p>Iverson, who started Game 1 by missing his first 9 shots, at one point between the second and third quarters missed 11 straight shots. ''Allen is a warrior so nobody knows how he is going to feel tomorrow,'' Mutombo said. ''I need him. Even though he won't play 48 or 40 minutes, by him just getting dressed, it changes the entire game.''</p>
        <p>Since suffering a deep bruise in his left buttocks in Game 7 against Toronto, Iverson said this injury was worse than his bruised tailbone he suffered in March. ''And I had to miss 5 games for that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He admitted the pain kept him from guarding Allen, ''I couldn't chase him like I wanted to. He got a lot of open shots,'' Iverson said.</p>
