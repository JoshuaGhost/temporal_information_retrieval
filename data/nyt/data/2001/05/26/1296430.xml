        <p>Biggest Tax Cut in 20 YearsIs Facing Final Votes Today  Congressional negotiators agreed on all the aspects of the tax cut, and final votes are scheduled for today in the House and Senate. The government will send a rebate check this year to all Americans who pay income taxes. Tax rates will drop, taxes for married couples will fall, the tax credit for children will be expanded and the estate tax will eventually be repealed.</p>

        <p>Senate Shift in High Gear  The Democrats who are expected to lead the Senate's 15 committees are busy shaping the year ahead after their party takes control of the Senate for the first time since 1994.</p>

        <p>Bush Advises Free Thinking  A day after President Bush discovered that a touch of political risk-taking cost him control of the United States Senate, he told graduates of the United States Naval Academy that they need the freedom to roam in new directions even if ''some of your ideas may fail.'' The speech was drafted before the White House discovered Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont was defecting.</p>

        <p>Deaths Put Focus on Border  Immigrant rights groups said the deaths of 14 Mexicans in the desert near Yuma, Ariz., have caused them to consider stronger challenges to what they call hostile United States border policy. Doctors said the condition of the 12 Mexican immigrants who survived was improving.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Mexico's minister for migrant affairs said after visiting four of the survivors in the hospital there was much that both countries had to do to prevent more Mexicans from suffering such a fate. President Vicente Fox said he wanted the United States to grant legal status to as many Mexican migrants as possible.</p>

        <p>Pataki Faces Rough Race For Third Term as Governor  As Gov. George E. Pataki looks toward a probable run for a third term next year, New York's political landscape starts to resemble a minefield. A Republican, he leads a state that leans heavily Democratic now more than ever, and he is likely to face a well-known opponent. The economy has stalled and an electricity crisis may be just over the horizon. This shapes up as a very tough race for Mr. Pataki, strategists said.</p>
