        <p>Most New Yorkers would have no reason to know about it, but in the last five months, the Democratic mayoral candidates have been shuttling around the city, taking questions at often tiny forums, as they tested -- presumably without much public attention -- the themes and appeals for their campaigns.</p>
        <p>That is about to change. Tomorrow morning, the four major Democratic candidates will appear on an hourlong debate on WNBC television, Channel 4, which is sponsoring the session with The Daily News. It is a rules-free discussion that promises to give the viewing public its first extended look at the Democrats who are seeking to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, who is barred by term limits from running again.</p>

        <p>Most New Yorkers would have no reason to know about it, but in the last five months, the Democratic mayoral candidates have been shuttling around the city, taking questions at often tiny forums, as they tested -- presumably without much public attention -- the themes and appeals for their campaigns.</p>
        <p>That is about to change. Tomorrow morning, the four major Democratic candidates will appear on an hourlong debate on WNBC television, Channel 4, which is sponsoring the session with The Daily News. It is a rules-free discussion that promises to give the viewing public its first extended look at the Democrats who are seeking to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, who is barred by term limits from running again.</p>
        <p>''There are no formal rules,'' said Gabe Pressman, the NBC moderator who will lead the questioning with Michael Kramer of The News. Mr. Pressman, who has been moderating  candidate debates in New York since Richard M. Nixon lived in the White House, added: ''The only rule is to try to get an answer. That's the imperative. To try to get an answer, without having anybody filibuster.''</p>
        <p>Aides to the four Democrats said they did not expect the debate to draw a particularly large audience, given that it begins at 9 a.m. on the first Sunday of May.</p>
        <p>Advisers to the candidates said, though, that they expected the debate to help shape early impressions of the race among other politicians and in the news media, and thus could prove to be an event of more than a little political significance.</p>
        <p>''At this point, I still don't think the people of New York are thoroughly engaged in this race, because they do have other lives,'' said David Axelrod, a consultant to Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, who is one of the candidates. ''So I don't think it's going to make or break anybody's candidacy. But I do think it's going to be a benchmark.''</p>
        <p>So it was that at least some of the Democrats were boning up yesterday for tomorrow's session. Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, spent part of his day going through mock debates, with aides filling in for the other three candidates. Mr. Axelrod flew in from his office in Chicago to join advisers with Mr. Ferrer as he engaged in his own practice sessions.</p>
        <p>Aides to the other two candidates played down the extent of their preparation, though that appeared to be a fairly routine effort to lower expectations. ''Honestly, to this minute, I've had a 90-second conversation with the comptroller about this,'' Hank Morris, a senior adviser to Alan G. Hevesi, said yesterday afternoon. He called back later to say that he had spent another 20 minutes speaking with Mr. Hevesi, and expected to continue preparatory discussions today.</p>
        <p>Aides to the fourth candidate, Mark Green, the public advocate, said they expected that if there were any fire at the debate, Mr. Green would be the target of it, since he is ahead in most polls. Mr. Green spent part of yesterday reading some of his old speeches and reviewing issues.</p>
        <p>While all four of the candidates have considerable experience in government and campaigns, Mr. Green, presumably, should be quite comfortable with this debate format: He has been a regular guest on CNN's nightly debate program, ''Crossfire,'' speaking from the left, of course.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pressman said he would bring a stopwatch to his third-floor studio at Rockefeller Center to make sure that no candidate talked too much. Although he would not mention names, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green, in particular, have shown a propensity to be, well, talkative.</p>
        <p>''In this crowd, you have to be prepared to fight for your space, because there are guys who can chew up a lot of the clock,'' Mr. Axelrod said.</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Pressman's debates are known for their lack of structure and quirky questions, which means that for the candidates, this could be a fairly unpredictable hour of live television.</p>
