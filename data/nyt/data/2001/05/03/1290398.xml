        <p>RIZK-Khalil. The Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Aids Institute mourn the passing of longtime friend Khalil Rizk. As a charter member of the Institute's International Advisory Committee, Khalil was an early and generous supporter of Aids research at a time when little was known about the disease. He touched us all with his extraordinary sense of compassion and we will miss him deeply. To his family and friends, we extend our condolences. Barry R. Bloom, Dean Harvard School of Public Health Dr. Max Essex, Chair, Harvard Aids Institute</p>
        <p>RIZK-Khalil. We shall miss our good friend, Khalil whose charm, wit and warmth were unequaled. It is a devasting loss to us personally and to the world. Geza and Elizabeth von Habsburg</p>
