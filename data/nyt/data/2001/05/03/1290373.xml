        <p>Felix Trinidad may be fighting for the first time as a middleweight when he faces the two-time World Boxing Association middleweight champion William Joppy on May 12, but Trinidad does not expect he will ever again enter a boxing ring at a lower weight class. The undefeated four-time world champion, who has fought primarily as a welterweight and a superwelterweight, said yesterday that he was comfortable fighting at the 160-pound middleweight limit.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he would consider going back down to 154 pounds for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya or Fernando Vargas, Trinidad said: ''Once you go up, I don't see a way to go down. I am pursuing a special accomplishment right now. When I win this fight, I don't want there to be any doubt that I'm the best.''</p>

        <p>Felix Trinidad may be fighting for the first time as a middleweight when he faces the two-time World Boxing Association middleweight champion William Joppy on May 12, but Trinidad does not expect he will ever again enter a boxing ring at a lower weight class. The undefeated four-time world champion, who has fought primarily as a welterweight and a superwelterweight, said yesterday that he was comfortable fighting at the 160-pound middleweight limit.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he would consider going back down to 154 pounds for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya or Fernando Vargas, Trinidad said: ''Once you go up, I don't see a way to go down. I am pursuing a special accomplishment right now. When I win this fight, I don't want there to be any doubt that I'm the best.''</p>
        <p>Trinidad and Joppy are each trying to unify the middleweight division, attempting to become the first middleweight champion recognized by the three major boxing organizations since Marvelous Marvin Hagler more than 15 years ago. The winner of the Trinidad-Joppy bout at Madison Square Garden will face Bernard Hopkins on Sept. 15 for the undisputed middleweight title, the last step in a three-fight middleweight championship series.</p>
        <p>In a conference call from his training camp in Puerto Rico yesterday, Trinidad said he currently weighs 163 pounds. That is 12 pounds less than his normal weight when not training, according to his father and trainer, Felix Trinidad, Sr. Last week, in a similar conference call with reporters, Joppy, who has a 32-1-1 record with seven successful title defenses, suggested that he was a more natural middleweight than Trinidad.</p>
        <p>''I don't care what he's saying,'' Trinidad (39-0 with 32 knockouts) said yesterday of Joppy. ''He will learn that he's never encountered a fighter like me. When he sees me, he'll be impressed.''</p>
