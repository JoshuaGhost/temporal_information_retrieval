        <p>Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. has borrowed a line from a well-known competitor for its stock-listing switch from Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange: time to make the doughnuts.</p>
        <p>This Thursday, Krispy Kreme will give away 40,000 ''hot original glazed'' doughnuts from a makeshift assembly-line kitchen outside the N.Y.S.E. building. Scott Livengood, Krispy Kreme's chairman and chief executive, praised Nasdaq, where his Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company went public last year in one of the most successful stock offerings. But he said the N.Y.S.E. was the ''most prestigious register of consumer brands in the world.''</p>

        <p>Besides, it would be difficult to stage a doughnut giveaway outside Nasdaq, which has no trading floor.</p>
