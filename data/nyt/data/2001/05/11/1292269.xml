        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ''AFRICAN FORMS,'' Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).</p>

        <p>* ''AFRICAN FORMS,'' Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8).

        <p>* ''BEAUTY, HONOR AND TRADITION: THE LEGACY OF PLAINS INDIAN SHIRTS,'' Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through Nov. 4). To Plains Indians of the 18th and 19th centuries, magnificently decorated hide shirts were symbols of bravery earned only by the most courageous in battle. Obsessively fringed and embellished with porcupine quills, paint, ribbon, hair and, later, tight patterns of colored glass beads, the shirts took on the spirits of their owners and even today are made for wearing at powwows and in recognition of other accomplishments. Celebrating the power of this glory gear, almost 50 dazzlers in the museum's collection are on view, dating from about 1820 to the 1990's. Among the more fascinating examples are a brilliantly painted Crow shirt (1890) with beadwork in geometric patterns and frizzy fringes of dyed magenta and yellow hair and a Lakota shirt, circa 1890, that carries United States Army insignia, the American flag and stepped tepees topped by crosses, all worked in porcupine quills and metal beads. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Free. (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''BITSTREAMS'' AND ''DATA DYNAMICS,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 10). Companion digital shows with a well-mannered, slightly dull air of decorous efficiency and cheerful modernity that encapsulates what you may regard as an ethos at large. Both affairs survey the new technological age in art, and there is no denying the inevitability of the big message here, which we discount at the risk of sheer stupidity: technology is changing how artists, especially young ones, make all types of art and, in turn, how we experience it. Still, the work produced needs to answer the old question: Does it move us? And there's the rub. A few artists, like Paul Pfeiffer and Jeremy Blake, stand out in ''BitStreams.'' In ''Data Dynamics,'' works like ''Apartment'' and ''Netomat,'' metaphors for the Web as global unconscious, suggest that Internet art is at least becoming more like traditional media, whereby most but no longer all of what you see is unremarkable. Don't skip the sound section in ''BitStreams,'' 25 audio artists working squarely in the tradition of musique concrète, a half-century-old movement but with new digital means replacing tape recorders. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays; Saturdays, Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''WILLIAM BLAKE,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through June 24). A touching and beautiful show if you have a taste for Blake's art, which strives for ecstatic revelation on the level of his famous visions and rises to the heights of his verse, sometimes. From the Age of Aquarius to New Age, he has come to serve as the patron saint of flower children, Jungians, Freudians, occultists, spiritualists, nudists, unpublished authors, animal lovers, socialists and teenagers of the sort who read Hermann Hesse. By turning our attention to his laborious illustrations and watercolors, the exhibition compels us to think about him as a serious and original visual artist, which is to say as a more idiosyncratic and substantial figure than the clichés suggest. He truly believed that the world was ending and that he had been sent to set things right at the last minute. Whatever else he may or may not have been, Blake was the most genuine and uncompromising artist you can think of. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Oct. 14). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancée Bella Rosenfeld and then hurry back to the French capital. Instead World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest works. The 60 here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and 60+ (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* ''KENNETH JOSEPHSON: A RETROSPECTIVE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through May 27). The first full-scale career assessment for one of the earliest and most inventive explorers of photography's character and the issues of perception and representation that it raises. In the 1960's, when Mr. Josephson began commenting on it, the truthfulness of photography was still a myth with a powerful hold on the imagination. Best of all, his philosophizing is often served up with a generous portion of wit. Much of his work has never been exhibited, and he is not nearly as well known as he deserves to be.  Hours and admission: See above (Vicki Goldberg).</p>
        <p>* ''VERMEER AND THE DELFT SCHOOL,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 27). Genius does not flourish in a vacuum. That's the simple lesson vividly conveyed by this alternately tousled and crystalline exhibition. With 15 Vermeers -- nearly half his known paintings -- serving as ballast, this exhibition almost giddily spotlights a succession of artists, tracking the emergence of an increasingly effortless illusionism in Delft in the 1650's and 60's. Flower still lifes, whitewashed church interiors, townscapes and genre scenes by Pieter de Hooch, Carel Fabritius and Gerard Houckgeest are part of the mix, along with drawings and a breathtaking selection of small landscapes by artists you've never heard of. All this contextualizing sharpens one's sense of Vermeer's achievement, but it also spells out the milieu without which he would not have been Vermeer. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>BERND AND HILLA BECHER, ''Photographs From the 1960's and 70's,'' Zwirner &amp; Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677. (through May 25). This exhibition samples the early efforts of the German team that helped establish the camera's art-world credentials with rigorous black-and-white photographs of lime kilns, blast furnaces and water towers that capture the body industrial (Smith).</p>
        <p>* LOUISE BOURGEOIS, ''The Personages,'' C &amp; M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through June 9). Bone-skinny, striking and each an individual, Ms. Bourgeois's 19 bronze ''Personages'' are enigmatic, people-size totems that stand in amiable camaraderie, like well-behaved guests at a cultural soiree. But their presence is insistent. Made from 1947 to 1953, and Surrealistic in origin, they greet the viewer at eye level, dispensing with the built-up bases that afflicted most earlier sculpture. Revisiting this powerful body of work strengthens awareness of the inspired personal vision with which Ms. Bourgeoise has enriched the universe of sculpture (Glueck).</p>
        <p>KARA HAMMOND, Joseph Rickards, 1045 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 924-0858 (through Wednesday). Five sweet, delicately made pencil drawings represent an assortment of technological yet oddly poetic objects: a blimp, an old radio tube, an oil-rig escape pod, a safe hanging by a rope and the strangely blossoming sphere of a nuclear bomb mushroom cloud. A four-foot-square painting of a space station interior suggests Ms. Hammond works best closer to miniature scale (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>JIM PETERS, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through May 19). Carnal desire animates deliberately grungy assemblages and collages in a show by an artist with a master's degree in nuclear engineering. The contrast between roughly built, crustily painted structural elements and the photographs of attractive naked women that they frame suggests a tension between raw actuality and idealizing fantasy. One senses an underlying anxiety, which might be worth making more visible (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through June 30). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop art by the movement's star names. The 26 objects shown here, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. Collectors' collectors, the Powerses made the pursuit into an art of their own (Glueck).</p>
        <p>REEVA POTOFF, ''Zero Gravity,'' Kouros, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-5888 (through May 31). A veteran installation artist here shows a series of analytic yet evocative, grid-based photographic collages. In each, the image of a female swimmer shot from behind and below water is mediated by a field of darkly translucent photographic squares. The effect is like a modern stained-glass window and almost mystically haunting (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* JOAN BROWN: ''CATS AND DOGS,'' George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665 (through May 19). Anyone unfamiliar with Joan Brown (1938-1990) will find this selection of pictures with dogs or cats in them an excellent introduction to an exuberantly original painter. Not to be missed is the large 1969 diptych in which Rufus the dog observes the artist and her husband posed in formal evening wear under an arcade of trees with valentine-shaped clouds tumbling in the sky (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHARLES HARBUTT, ''Dreams and Memories . . . ,'' Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through May 19). This small retrospective looks back on an admirable 40-year career in photojournalism. With affectionate warmth and great framing instincts, Mr. Harbutt captures moments of riveting narrative pregnancy. In a shot in Milan in 1970, for example, five businessmen gather on an astonishingly long modern stairway against a high wall splashed by sunlight; you feel an almost divine immanence (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>* GENE BEERY, Mitchell Algus, 25 Thompson Street, (212) 966-1758 (through May 19). The wordy sign paintings by this pioneering Conceptualist mischief-maker are funny and philosophically knotty. A recent work, ''Essences Only,'' consists of a comically self-referential message hastily brushed in black paint on white canvas: ''My life is too short to spend much time on formal painting art concerns. I am simply recording essences.'' Just so (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''DANGER,'' Exit Art/The First World, 548 Broadway, between Prince and Spring Streets, (212) 966-7745 (through May 19). Little in this disappointing theme show seems truly dangerous and no clear thesis about danger in art emerges. A noisy machine by Robert Chambers shoots air in your face; amusing junk robots by Chico MacMurtrie dance and masturbate; Gregory Green has set up a consulate for a real nation he is trying to create on an unclaimed island; and elegant, emblematic photographs by Susan Seubert symbolize various phobias (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ANTONIO FRASCONI, Sragow, 73 Spring Street, (212) 219-1793 (through May 19) and El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 20). This eminent, socially engaged printmaker is showing rough expressionistic, politically charged woodcuts from the 1940's at Sragow. At El Museo del Barrio is a recent series of richly colored, textured and abstracted prints that illustrate Langston Hughes's poem ''Let America Be America Again'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROBERT RYMAN AND IAN WILSON, Peter Blum Gallery, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through June 2). Bringing together examples of Mr. Ryman's stripped-down paintings and evidence from Mr. Wilson's various Conceptual Art activities, this exhibition tellingly contrasts different kinds of aesthetic purism (Smith).</p>
        <p>VALTON TYLER, Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through June 30). The paintings by this self-taught Texan verge on a kind of surrealistic kitsch, but they are persuasively strange. At his best, in large, weirdly stylized landscapes Mr. Tyler accumulates simplified tubular and spiky forms into dense jungle scenes that have the Cubist palpability and otherworldly dreaminess of Henri Rousseau (Johnson).</p>
        <p>STEPHEN WESTFALL, Lennon Weinberg Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through June 2). In this quiet knockout of a show, Mondrianist grids and color blocks are once more infused with worldly reference and postmodern play while being extended on their own adamantly visual terms. Intimations of domestic interiors are among the new additions, along with doubled or widened grids that ante up to the usual jittery spatial contradictions. In all, the subtle yet marvelously optical jostling, something of a Westfall trademark, is increased almost to the point of breaking into dance (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* ROBERT BARRY, ''Early Works, 1966-73,'' Gasser &amp; Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494 (through May 19). This beautifully installed exhibition presents classic works by a pioneer of dematerialized art. Mr. Barry's visually minimal, verbally paradoxical works operate like Zen koans to heighten awareness of the mystery of consciousness. One, penciled in fine block letters on the wall, reads, ''All the things I know but of which I am not at the moment thinking -- 1:36 PM; June 15, 1969'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''HOME AND THE WORLD: AN EXPLORATION OF IDENTITY AT CROSSROADS,'' India Center of Art and Culture, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 462-4221 (through May 31). The center is a recently opened nonprofit space devoted equally to art, literature, music and film, and most of those media play some role in this group exhibition of contemporary artists of Indian descent (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>MELISSA MEYER; ALEX STOLYAROV, Elizabeth Harris, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-9666 (through May 19). Ms. Meyer's loosely gridded, confidently improvised paintings exude a fine summery light. With wide brushes she layers loopy squiggles of color over radiant patchwork fields; the effect is rigorously economical yet hedonistically sumptuous. Mr. Stolyarov's compact, extremely thick, lusciously colored monochrome abstractions are like giant Chiclets (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ESTER PARTEGÁS, De Chiara/Stewart, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 967-6007 (through May 26). For her second New York solo, Ms. Partegás has installed rows of diminutive modern seats made of cardboard and other lightweight materials. Along with planters holding ferns made of silver cardboard, framed blank signboards on the wall and color-coordinated floor and wall paint, it all adds up to a toddler-scale airport waiting room. The spell is undermined by real stuff like luggage, fast food and magazines scattered around, but the magical miniaturism still prevails (Johnson).</p>
        <p>FRAN SIEGEL: ''INTERFERENCE,'' Margaret Thatcher Projects, 529 West 20th Street  (212) 675-0222 (through May 26). Shimmering wall works of steel mesh backed by painted Plexiglas radiate pale, offbeat shades that resonate in the small space of this gallery. Ms. Siegel achieves her effects by painting on a Plexiglas panel, then covering the panel and its frame with a cover sheet of thin steel, punctuated by dots in random patterns. The color streams through the holes, shifting and changing with the angle at which the works are viewed. An extension of the painting is a row of light papier-mâché balls suspended from the ceiling on nylon string, hovering just above the floor. The balls, each with a mirror under it, move and bobble in response to ambient air currents, again creating a shifting space and adding to the show's appeal (Glueck).</p>
        <p>DOUG WADA, Dee/Glasoe, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545 (through May 26). This canny painter updates Jasper Johns with his deadpan fusion of Pop, trompe l'oeil realism and grid-based formalism. You might mistake a 6-by-10-foot canvas for a wall of green high school lockers; in two other works, plastic subway seats fitted perfectly into the rectangle of the picture have a startling palpability. Other subjects include a wire-mesh trash receptacle, stacks of rounded suitcases and an air-conditioner (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>GLORIA KLEIN, ''Paradise Found,'' Gallery Onetwentyeight, 128 Rivington Street, between Essex and Norfolk Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 674-0244 (through May 19). Ms. Klein's new drawings, displayed in a small back gallery, consist of odd-shaped interlocked geometric forms in colored pencil on paper. They suggest both exuberant jigsaw puzzles, every piece in place, and abstract woodland landscapes of lush green foliage, purple shadows and bursts of radiant light. Tabletop size, they were clearly created up-close and are meant for up-close viewing (Cotter).</p>
        <p>LIZZIE SCOTT AND JOSH BLACKWELL, P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, entrance on East Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 228-4249 (through May 20). These two artists use fabric as a metaphor for ephemerality and as a source of unsuspected beauty. Using gouache, Mr. Blackwell replicates found patterns -- flowered furniture covering, the stripes in an American flag -- on paper and pins his versions to the original material. Ms. Scott, who stands out here, makes rubbings of tiled bathroom floors on pieces of fine silk, then trims the results with mother-of-pearl buttons and satin roses, creating what appear to be elegantly off-center cloaks. Lovely (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''SCULPTURE,'' Flipside, 84 Withers Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 389-7108 (through May 27). Sculpture as intimate as drawing is the unstated theme. Mary Carlson's stoneware serpents and Julia Kunin's crystal octopuses hang on the wall, as do Janet Pihlblad's fragrant moss-covered window frames. Elana Herzog transforms the wall itself with stapled and torn cloth. Drew Shiflett's free-standing structures of paper and glue are like furniture made splinter by splinter. Matt Freedman offers a small panoramic view of the gallery within the gallery; at Five Myles, 558 St. John's Place in Crown Heights, (718) 783-4438, he has collaborated with neighborhood children on a wraparound mural of Prospect Park, up through May 19 (Cotter).</p>
        <p>QIU ZHIJIE, Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250 (through May 19). This young Beijing-based artist makes his New York debut with a show that plays with and extends classical forms. Calligraphic scrolls carry outtakes from the dictionary. On other scrolls, elements of ink-and-brush landscapes -- trees, figures, pavilions -- are cut loose from their original contexts. In a video the artist writes out Tang dynasty poems, but the tape is played backward so that he seems to be erasing them. He's moving in several directions at this point, but certain themes (cultural fragmentation, transience) and attitudes (brash Zen-style wit, nostalgia) are constants (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ''ANOTHER, ONCE AGAIN, MANY TIMES MORE,'' Feature, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7772 (through tomorrow). This show of serial work has something for everybody, and possibly a little too much for some viewers. John Torreano covers the wall with bejeweled half-spheres, Lisa Beck with painted tondos, Nancy Shaver with stacked architectural outtakes and David Morreno with a suave pattern-painting titled ''Door Knob Head: The Movie Sequence.'' Michael St. John edges into fraught terrain with a sculptural lineup of serial killers from horror films. Daniel Hesidence follows up with alarming paintings of bullet-strafed heads, all women. Howard Johnson is an island unto himself with thick collages made of ink drawings, reflective stickers, floor plans and G-strings, forming a grimy looking Insider-Outsider Art mélange with lots of promise (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE COS COB ART COLONY: IMPRESSIONISTS ON THE CONNECTICUT SHORE,'' National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sunday). From 1890 to 1920, Cos Cob, Conn., was a hangout for American Impressionist painters, led by John H. Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, Childe Hassam and Theodore Robinson. Writers and journalists added to the scene's buzz. Though art talk and theorizing ran at fever pitch, in practice the Cos Cobbers put out a quiet, conservative brand of Impressionism that emphasized a bright palette, pastoral subjects and a concentration on what the novelist and critic William Dean Howells once called ''the smiling aspects of life.'' Still, as a footnote to American art history, Cos Cob deserves recognition. Even though this is not the most urgent exhibition in town, it includes some lovely paintings, produced by the group's minor artists as well as its stars. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5 (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''ANDREAS GURSKY,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). The giant pictures in this midcareer retrospective of Mr. Gursky, the 46-year-old German photographer, are so eye-poppingly, drop-dead gorgeous that in this world, where no good turn goes unpunished, you may feel compelled to react with suspicion and reserve. But knee-jerk resistance at the sight of the nondescript global emblems of new capitalist sprawl that he photographs is short-circuited by sheer awe at the incredible, sublimely weird, almost erotic glamour he imparts to them. The work is instantly attractive to the point of alarm, which is the feeling of falling in love. You might as well give yourself over to it and worry about the consequences later. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8:15 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>FARIBA HAJAMADI, Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-2668 (through tomorrow). This brainy, Iranian-born conceptualist uses photography to explore unspoken ideologies that drive Western museum practices. In six large, handsome, digitally manipulated views of museum exhibition spaces, Ms. Hajamadi gives her project an obliquely autobiographical spin by including obscure reflections of her own image and composing her own fictive installations of art and artifacts (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* SIMON LEE AND CLAIRE LESTEVEN, Smack Mellon Studios, 56 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761 (through Sunday). In Mr. Lee's cinematic installation, a screen stretching across the darkened gallery is filled with luminous drifting images of animals, trees, houses and figures that appear to be under a microscope lens. They are all ''live'' projections of tiny plastic forms floating in a tank of eddying water. The results are a metaphor for the random flow of history, and a low-tech formal tour de force. In a separate solo show, Ms. Lesteven shows photographs and videos made with multi-aperture cyclindrical versions of a pinpoint camera, producing eerily distorted pictures of public spaces. Here, too, the means are straightforward, the ends evocative (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* PAUL McCARTHY, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sunday). From his far-out position where the psychic security of Hollywood's packaging of sex and violence doesn't exist, Mr. McCarthy taps veins deep in the collective subconscious, well beyond where most shock artists have the audacity or intelligence to operate. He has been a cultish presence in Los Angeles for years, and his moment has finally come in New York. We see an artist of wild highs and lows, of black comedy, cheap jokes, unspeakable actions, dry formalism and some real fiascoes -- the mark of an artist risking failure, a good sign. There is something beyond mere Pop parody or social provocation in the work, something to do with deep private needs and desires, which we perceive secondhand as comic pathos. It is art as tough therapy, disturbingly honest. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''WILLIAM TROST RICHARDS IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,'' Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879 5500 (through Sunday). A 19th-century landscapist who worked in the tradition of the Hudson River School, Richards (1833-1905) made his mark as a painter of coastal scenes and as a watercolorist. The Met acquired a large trove of his watercolors in 1880 from the Rev. Elias Magoon, but let many of them go in 1929 when the Hudson River School was in disfavor. It has gradually been recouping, and although this show of oils, watercolors and drawings by no means provides a comprehensive view of Richards's career, it is a useful sketch of it from youth until shortly before his death. The White Mountains, the environs of Newport and scenes of the English coast were among his prime subjects, and one of the loveliest of the mountain scenes here is ''Moonlight on Mount Lafayette'' (1873), a poetic nighttime view of a lush, brook-crossed terrain. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>HOUGHTON CRANFORD SMITH, ''The Purist Landscapes,'' Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through tomorrow). In Paris in the early 1930's, this American painter learned Purism, a variation on Cubism, from Amédée Ozenfant. Returning to New York, Smith combined idealizing simplification and finely textured paint in pastoral landscapes, producing images of New England hills or harbors or South American mountains that call to mind Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent and Charles Sheeler. But they also have their own slightly comical, slightly melancholy serenity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''VAN GOGH'S POSTMAN: THE PORTRAITS OF JOSEPH ROULIN,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). This revelatory micro exhibition reunites five portraits of the postal worker Joseph Roulin, whom van Gogh met in Arles. The show affords an excellent opportunity to study the painter's craft as he processes a single motif through a series of approaches from painterly naturalism to richly patterned symbolism. It is fascinating as well to see the portraits in light of the biographical background. Roulin cared for van Gogh after the famous ear-cutting incident, and he grew in the artist's imagination from an amusing local character to a figure of Christ-like benevolence. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).</p>
