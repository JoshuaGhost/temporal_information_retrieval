        <p>For her first New York solo exhibition, Bora Kim has built a marvelous, surrealistic peep show. Filling most of the gallery is a floor-to-ceiling white cube punctured on two sides by holes near eye level. Each hole is angled and fitted with a lens so that your vision is specifically directed but uncertainly magnified.</p>

        <p>Silverstein Gallery  520 West 21st Street, Chelsea  Through May 19</p>
        <p>For her first New York solo exhibition, Bora Kim has built a marvelous, surrealistic peep show. Filling most of the gallery is a floor-to-ceiling white cube punctured on two sides by holes near eye level. Each hole is angled and fitted with a lens so that your vision is specifically directed but uncertainly magnified.</p>
        <p>Peering in, you discover different views of a two-part, otherworldly environment that apparently fills the space inside the cube. One part is a dark, cavelike room with walls covered in thick green moss. A twisted, mossy ladder leads up and out through a rectangular window, and a satiny green, serpentine creature appears to be crawling out of the moss room into a second chamber, this one a big, bright room finished with white ceramic tile like a bathroom or hospital room. Incongruously, large hardwood trees are growing in the white room, and here and there -- on the floor or hanging from tree branches -- are bright red blobs.</p>
        <p>What all this means is impossible to say for sure, but the play of opposites -- dark-light, organic-inorganic, hard-soft, inside-out -- is marvelously evocative. And the experience of this fantastic space of unknown scale on the other side of reality as we know it is hair-raising.</p>
