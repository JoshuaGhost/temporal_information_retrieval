        <p>Margaret Thatcher Projects  529 West 20th Street  Chelsea  Through May 26</p>
        <p>Shimmering wall works of steel mesh backed by fluorescent Plexiglas seduce the eye in this colorific show. They radiate pale, offbeat shades that resonate in the small space of the gallery. Fran Siegel achieves her effects by painting on a Plexiglas panel and then boxing in the painted panel and its frame with a cover sheet of thin steel punctured by dots in random patterns. The color streams through the holes, shifting and changing with the angle at which the work is viewed. It seems to hover in space rather than assert a fixed position.</p>

        <p>Margaret Thatcher Projects  529 West 20th Street  Chelsea  Through May 26</p>
        <p>Shimmering wall works of steel mesh backed by fluorescent Plexiglas seduce the eye in this colorific show. They radiate pale, offbeat shades that resonate in the small space of the gallery. Fran Siegel achieves her effects by painting on a Plexiglas panel and then boxing in the painted panel and its frame with a cover sheet of thin steel punctured by dots in random patterns. The color streams through the holes, shifting and changing with the angle at which the work is viewed. It seems to hover in space rather than assert a fixed position.</p>
        <p>In ''Interference 06,'' a relatively simple work, vertical waves of silvery blue are created by thousands of tiny holes in the steel over a blue ground. ''Interference 08'' has a far more elaborately worked surface that produces a lacy froth over a ground of green. They could be abstract land or waterscapes, but they refuse such a commitment.</p>
        <p>A spare yet arresting installation is meant to be an extension of the painting: rows of light papier-mâché balls are suspended from the ceiling on nylon string, hovering just above the floor. Each has a color painted on its bottom that is reflected in a round mirror underneath it. The balls move and bobble in response to ambient air currents, again creating a shifting space and adding to the show's appeal.</p>
