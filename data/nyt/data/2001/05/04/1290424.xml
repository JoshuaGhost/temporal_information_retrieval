        <p>Did you ever wonder where Mickey Mouse came from? The artistic equivalent of Mickey Mouse's DNA has just come on the market, an event that should interest Mouseketeers of all ages.</p>
        <p>On May 19 Guernsey's, a Manhattan auction house, is conducting a sale of cartoon and comic art that includes the original drawings from the first Mickey Mouse animated cartoon, ''Plane Crazy.'' They and  350 other original cartoon works are being sold to benefit the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
        <p>The cartoonist Mort Walker founded the museum in 1974 and was instrumental in its move from Rye Brook, Conn., to Boca Raton in 1996. ''We have $2 million worth of debt,'' he said. ''We only pay $1 a year to the city in taxes but we built a 52,000-square-foot museum, the largest cartoon museum in the world. Maybe it should have been smaller. We've missed a few mortgage payments and the bank wanted to foreclose on us, so we decided to go to auction.''</p>
        <p>Jeanne Greever, the museum's director of operations, added: ''The art in the auction was donated with the understanding it could be used for fund-raising. In fact, Stephen A. Geppi, the man who gave us the Mickey Mouse drawings, let us put them up for collateral for a loan and told us it was O.K. to sell them.''</p>
        <p>''Plane Crazy,'' a short made in 1928, was inspired by the wild popularity of the hero aviator Charles Lindbergh. Mickey Mouse is depicted as a swashbuckling pilot who enlists the help of a barnyard of animals to build a small plane. By studying a book, ''How to Fly,'' he gets it constructed and goes barnstorming across the countryside.</p>
        <p>''Walt Disney was born in Chicago and lived in Kansas, but he spent an important part of his youth in rural Marceline, Missouri,'' said John Canemaker, the director of the animation program at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. ''That's where he learned to appreciate nature. The anthropomorphism of the animals comes from that time.''</p>
        <p>Minnie Mouse also makes her debut in the film. She is a young ladylike mouse who bats her eyelashes, and Mickey falls for her. He tries to impress her by taking her for a spin in his plane. We see them in the open cockpit, happily barnstorming over housetops -- until he tries to smooch with her in midflight. She smacks him, jumps out and falls to earth, using her bloomers as a parachute. Mickey crashes into a tree, smashing the plane to smithereens, but survives, unscarred, with his lucky horseshoe.</p>
        <p>''During the Depression, Mickey Mouse came to symbolize Americans' can-do spirit,'' Mr. Canemaker said. ''He communicated optimism. He could do anything: sing, dance, be a pilot, a cowboy, a riveter.'' Drawn by Ubbe Iwerks, one of Disney's original animators, Mickey is presented as a happy-go-lucky character full of boyish mischief. ''He had flair and spirit,'' Mr. Canemaker said.</p>
        <p>He began life with a round body, round black ears, round head, round black nose and eye sockets, and round buttons on his shorts. Originally, he had no shoes or gloves, but he did have a long curling tail, which eventually disappeared.</p>
        <p>''He's a perfect character in that he is made up of circles, the perfect form,'' Mr. Canemaker said. ''The circle symbolizes eternity, continuity, infinity and survival. There are no sharp edges or points to Mickey. His design is in total connection to his personality. He's a well-rounded character.''</p>
        <p>This is the enchanting Mickey that inspired 135 films, 73 years of comic books, the Mickey Mouse Club television shows, figurines, Christmas ornaments, scores of books and toys, and global adoration. Yet Mickey Mouse was created in a time of turmoil. In 1928 Disney and his wife, Lillian, were in New York when they learned that Disney's distributor had not only hired away most of his staff but had also gotten the rights to Disney's most successful animated character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.</p>
        <p>Disney decided to go out on his own. The couple took a train to Los Angeles. Guernsey's project director, Melissa Breyer, writes in the catalog that Disney thought the train whistle sounded like ''maowww-a-mouse'' and dreamed up a new character called Mortimer Mouse. Lillian didn't like the name and suggested Mickey as a more catchy moniker, and he agreed. (Others report that he was thinking about a pet field mouse that had wandered into his studio years before in Kansas City.)</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, Disney began to work on Mickey Mouse right away. He registered the Mickey trademark and began brainstorming with  Iwerks, his loyal friend from Kansas City, one of the few who had not quit his original team. (This year is the centenary of the births of Disney and Iwerks, both of whom are subjects of documentaries and books). Iwerks, the self-taught draftsman responsible for Oswald the Rabbit, produced 700 drawings a day for two straight weeks for ''Plane Crazy.''</p>
        <p>Disney created Mickey's character and Iwerks brought him to life. ''The thrust of Mickey's personality came from Walt,'' Mr. Canemaker said. ''He became an icon of perseverance and pluck.''</p>
        <p>Disney is reported to have said: ''I want the characters to be somebody. I don't want them just to be a drawing.''</p>
        <p>The ''Plane Crazy'' sketches in the auction are covered with Disney's personal annotations: tiny checks, numbers and X's for deletion. As Ms. Breyer writes, ''All of these marks held significant meaning as to how the film would be animated.''</p>
        <p>At first, ''Plane Crazy'' was a flop. No major studio would distribute it. Then Disney thought about the 1927 film ''The Jazz Singer,'' the first film with sound. He added clanks and crashing sounds, animal noises and music to ''Plane Crazy.'' It was an immediate hit.</p>
        <p>''The best character animation is one you can understand without a sound track, one that can be read in a universal way,'' Mr. Canemaker said. ''Nonetheless, here the sound track made a difference. 'Plane Crazy' became funny.''</p>
        <p>The 36 sketches are pasted in panels, like a comic strip, on six pieces of cardboard. They are the precursors of the storyboards that have been used in filmmaking ever since, which adds historical importance to their sale.</p>
        <p>''A few years later, Disney used storyboards to streamline production,'' Mr. Canemaker said. ''He'd tack the drawings on a board and move them around until he got the order right.''</p>
        <p>The six ''Plane Crazy'' boards have been appraised at $3 million to $4 million, but they could go for much more. Other cartoon artists whose works are in the 600-lot sale include Bud Fisher of ''Mutt and Jeff,'' Hal Foster of ''Prince Valiant,'' Chester Gould of ''Dick Tracy,'' Al Capp of  ''L'il Abner,'' Jim Davis of ''Garfield,'' George Herriman of ''Krazy Kat,'' Bob Montana of ''Archie,'' Joe Oriolo of ''Felix the Cat,'' Bill Zaboly of ''Popeye,'' Garry Trudeau of ''Doonesbury'' and Jules Feiffer. Many of the artists donated works, to help the museum. Most lots are individually estimated at $100 to $300.</p>
        <p>The preview begins on May 17, at 3 p.m. at the New-York Historical Society on Central Park West at 77th Street, and continues through May 18 at 9 p.m. About 60 percent of the lots are from the nonprofit cartoon museum, which has more than 160,000 original drawings of animation art, comic books, comic strips, cartoons, illustrations, editorial cartoons and a vast multimedia library.
