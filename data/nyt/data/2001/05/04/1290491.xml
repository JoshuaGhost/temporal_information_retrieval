        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble and the Kao Corporation of Japan, the owner of the Jergens line of personal care products, are expected to submit bids worth as much as $5 billion today to Bristol-Myers Squibb for the Clairol hair care business, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Procter officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the company was very interested in bidding for Clairol and had done extensive work on the proposal.</p>
        <p>Kao has emerged as the most likely rival to Procter's bid for Clairol.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for P.&amp; G. and Jergens declined to comment.</p>
        <p>In a conference call last week, Bristol-Myers officials said the deadline for bids was today. A Bristol-Myers spokesman said yesterday that the company would not comment on potential bidders.</p>
        <p>The details of the Procter bid are unclear. Although analysts said the company was considering swapping its pharmaceutical business, one P.&amp; G. official said yesterday that the company would not give up its pharmaceutical division, which makes Actonel, a drug to fight osteoporosis. Still, Procter has been considering giving up some pharmaceutical technologies, as well as some of the over-the-counter medications that it sells, as part of the bid to acquire Clairol, the official said.</p>
        <p>P.&amp; G. formed a task force to study the Clairol business, its technology, regulatory issues and what sort of bid the company should make.</p>
        <p>Some analysts have said Procter would have to sell Clairol's Herbal Essences line of shampoo and conditioners if its bid were successful. But Procter officials think they would be able to keep Herbal Essences, a relatively small business compared with Procter's big brands like Pantene and Head &amp; Shoulders.</p>
        <p>Still, the prize Procter &amp; Gamble is after is not Herbal Essences but the fast-growing hair dye business. A. G. Lafley, Procter's chief executive, has been emphasizing hair care because of its growth and because innovations -- with premium prices -- can be introduced relatively quickly.</p>
        <p>Procter has been test-marketing coloring products that it developed from its research labs in Britain.</p>
        <p>''We have formulas on the market,'' one Procter official said. ''There is technology available. The key is how do you penetrate the market. The Clairol brand name would let us launch these innovations.''</p>
        <p>If another company won the bidding for Clairol, it would probably spend heavily to keep Procter's new products out. Procter officials said they would have a difficult time creating a toehold in the market because of the dominant positions of L'Or√©al and Clairol.</p>
        <p>''We have technology, but making room to get in is difficult,'' another Procter official said. ''It would be difficult to try to take Clairol head- on. No pun intended.''</p>
