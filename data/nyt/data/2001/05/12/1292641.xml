        <p>In his strongest comments to date regarding the proliferation of teenagers migrating to the N.B.A., Commissioner David Stern made it clear tonight that he thinks the league has a serious problem on its hands.</p>
        <p>''I really do believe that kids are now bouncing the ball in schoolyards saying, 'Just get to be 17 and that's where I'm going,' '' Stern said before Game 3 of the series between the Kings and the Lakers. ''School is an irrelevancy. The result of that is bad policy, bad for the kid's development, bad for the college game, bad for the business of the N.B.A. as well. I don't want to hide from that. It shouldn't make anyone here happy to be associated with basketball.''</p>

        <p>In his strongest comments to date regarding the proliferation of teenagers migrating to the N.B.A., Commissioner David Stern made it clear tonight that he thinks the league has a serious problem on its hands.</p>
        <p>''I really do believe that kids are now bouncing the ball in schoolyards saying, 'Just get to be 17 and that's where I'm going,' '' Stern said before Game 3 of the series between the Kings and the Lakers. ''School is an irrelevancy. The result of that is bad policy, bad for the kid's development, bad for the college game, bad for the business of the N.B.A. as well. I don't want to hide from that. It shouldn't make anyone here happy to be associated with basketball.''</p>
        <p>Stern's comments came 48 hours before college underclassmen and high school players could officially declare themselves eligible for the June 27 draft. More than 30 players and at least a half-dozen high school players have already sent letters to the league office, informing the N.B.A. of their intent.</p>
        <p>For almost two years, Stern has been pushing for an age limit of at least 20 years old. But he said tonight he had not found the support needed to stem the tide of young players entering the N.B.A.</p>
        <p>''I think the union is about as irresponsible on this issue as the union could be,'' Stern said of the National Basketball Players Association.</p>
        <p>Stern added: ''The coaches have one view, the administration of the N.C.A.A. has another. The union has no view.''</p>
        <p>Stern spoke passionately about the issue during February's All-Star Game weekend in Washington. But with the union insistent on not imposing an age limit and the N.C.A.A. not responding as he finds appropriate, Stern has stepped up the battle.</p>
        <p>''If I were a general manager, I don't want to miss out on the next Kobe, so what I'm going to do is get a kid who's not ready to play and cut a veteran,'' he said. ''That's what happening. And that's bad basketball policy.</p>
        <p>''If these kids have the ability to get a little more maturity, a little bit more coaching, a little bit more life experience over all, that's good.''</p>
        <p>Because of the timing of Stern's remarks, neither Billy Hunter, the head of the players' union, nor N.C.A.A. officials could be immediately reached.</p>
