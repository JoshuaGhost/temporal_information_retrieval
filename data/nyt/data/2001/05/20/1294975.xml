        <p>WITH a discreet ''shhhh,'' the Long Island Rail Road recently intensified its courtesy campaign to snuff out banal cell-phone chatter, which has become a daily irritant to passengers on the busiest rail line in North America.</p>
        <p>''Cell yell'' -- as train executives prefer to term the din -- is the stimulating chat of telephone users who assume others are deaf to their stock tips, dining choices, office numbers and professions of love. Granted, some conversations are brief and hushed, and others rise to Broadway melodrama (one Amtrak passenger was overheard the other day frantically calling friends  to warn her missing lover that her husband was on to them). But more often, cell-phone blather consists of periodic reports on geographic  location.</p>
        <p>The issue has become so fraught that Amtrak has banned the use of cell phones and pagers in special ''quiet cars'' on 25 of its trains along the Northeast corridor. And legislation has been introduced in New York State to establish cell-free zones on trains.</p>
        <p>The L.I.R.R., meanwhile, has taken a gentler approach to the problem, offering its riders tips on cellular manners. (So does Metro-North, which serves New York City's northern suburbs.) But judging from a highly informal survey of passenger habits, not to mention an Internet site devoted to commuter grievances, the railroad's etiquette drive may be falling on deaf ears.</p>
        <p>Let's eavesdrop.</p>
        <p>DOREEN CARVAJAL</p>
        <p>The railroad kicked things off in March with thousands of fliers and posters emblazoned with the slogan ''Talk low so no one will know.'' Brochures were scattered on passenger seats describing the characteristics of a ''good cell phone-using neighbor.''</p>
        <p>*Just remember our catchy courtesy slogan and ''Talk Low.''</p>
        <p>*When extended cell-phone calls are unavoidable, it's best if you step away from your seat for a few minutes and into the train's vestibule.</p>
        <p>*Keep your cell phone close by so you can retrieve it quickly.</p>
        <p>*Turn your ringer or audible alarm to the phone's vibration function.</p>
        <p>April 2: the 6:24 p.m. from Manhattan to the Long Island town of Port Washington. A middle-aged woman is hunched in a window seat with her cell phone pressed to her ear.</p>
        <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        <p>Yes, sweetheart.</p>
        <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        <p>Can you HEAR me?</p>
        <p>He's with his friend?</p>
        <p>Well tell him to pick me up on the 6:48.</p>
        <p>Yes, 6:48.</p>
        <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        <p>Can you HEAR me?</p>
        <p>Yes, 6:48.</p>
        <p>April 3: Four men bound for Great Neck take their seats and immediately begin dialing. Animated conversations take place in Farsi. A phone rings incessantly.</p>
        <p>Faint electronic notes of Maurice Ravel's ''Bolero.''</p>
        <p>Repeats with rising notes.</p>
        <p>Repeats again.</p>
        <p>Finale.</p>
        <p>April 6: A dissenting voice pipes up in a discussion group on the Web site L.I.R.R. Commuters Campaign (www.lirrcommuters.org).</p>
        <p>If the L.I.R.R. is going to ''crack down'' on cell-phone users, what about people who loudly talk to other passengers? Or riders who take up more than one seat with their packages and feet? What about unruly, misbehaving children? These problems have existed since way before cell phones, but the L.I.R.R. has largely ignored them. Why, all of a sudden, are cell-phone users the ''bad guys''?</p>
        <p>Others jump into the online debate, some with coping tips:</p>
        <p>Passenger 1: ''How come we don't seem to mind a group of people talking to each other on a train, but we get all upset when a person is talking on the cell phone (even at a normal decibel level)? Don't get me wrong. Granted, the loud ones should be tarred and feathered, but normal people have a right to talk as much as they want. As for what to do with the loud ones: Act strangely next to them. Look straight at them and pick your nose with a deranged smile on your face. I guarantee they'll move.''</p>
        <p>Passenger 2: ''I take the aisle seat so that if some guy on a cell phone starts beeping and blabbering I can get away quicker.''</p>
        <p>Passenger 3: ''To whom it may concern, I use earplugs to deal with the noise on my commute and I have a nice ride every time.''</p>
        <p>Passenger 4: ''I was trying to act strangely. It worked. The guy hung up the cell phone immediately.''</p>
        <p>April 11: the 6:11 p.m. to Port Washington. A passenger ponders her evening menu.</p>
        <p>I want your chicken platter and I want some of your salad platter. Yes, that's the salad. With the honey mustard. No, not the parmesan chicken. That's right, I want the tarragon. Yes, I'll pick it up. Okay, you too. Thank you. Good-bye.</p>
        <p>Speaking of fine dining, one rider relates the following on the commuter Web site.</p>
        <p>The guy next to me ate an entire box of dried-out spare ribs and washed them down with Coors Light while blabbing on the phone about some deal he made. When he was done with that, he took out his dental floss.</p>
        <p>April 25: the 6:46 p.m. to Port Washington. An animated, if cryptic, conversation carries through the front section of the car.</p>
        <p>Hey Annie. What's wrong?</p>
        <p>All right, all right. I'll call you as soon as I get to the station.</p>
        <p>It's the same place. Why?</p>
        <p>Well take it OFF. You'll have to take it out of there. We'll just have to pay for it. I'm getting off the train.</p>
        <p>April 26: the 9:11 a.m. from Port Washington to Manhattan. An early-morning check-in with the office.</p>
        <p>Hi, it's Ruben.</p>
        <p>Good, how about yourself?</p>
        <p>I'm coming in on the 9:11.</p>
        <p>I left her a voice mail and I just wanted to know if she picked it up.</p>
        <p>Could you give them the high-tech brochures? There should be two or three of each. All right, thanks a lot.</p>
        <p>April 29: A new horror story surfaces on the commuter Web site.</p>
        <p>I am over by the window, and a construction-worker type is on the end. A female-suit type sits between us, and proceeds to have several loud phone conversations. I like to sleep on the train, and most of the car noise does not bother me, but when this one started to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY, I cracked. I leaned in front of her to the guy on the end and said in a loud voice, ''Do you find this as annoying as I do?'' She did not get the message.</p>
        <p>In late April, another Long Island Rail Road brochure turns up on passenger seats with an update on the etiquette campaign.</p>
        <p>The campaign seems to be working. Our data isn't scientific, just anecdotal, but it seems that there are fewer cases of chronic ''cell yell'' these days. As a matter of fact, we have received some correspondence thanking us and offering congratulations on our campaign to promote and encourage good cell-phone manners! We're pleased if some of you think the campaign is having a positive impact.</p>
        <p>One passenger begs to differ in his own progress report posted on the commuter Web site.</p>
        <p>Amtrak has recently expanded their ''Quiet Car'' campaign to much positive feedback. The L.I.R.R. should follow their lead. Cell phones do not belong on all trains because people abuse them. An advertisement cannot teach common courtesy.</p>
        <p>May 7: the 9:11 a.m. from Port Washington to Manhattan. A young woman holds forth, oblivious to a nearby poster offering telephone etiquette tips. When three passengers move away during her second call, she glances down at her underarm and then resumes talking.</p>
        <p>Hi, can you hear me?</p>
        <p>Dude, they shut us down.</p>
        <p>I called my friend Joe on Wall Street. . . .</p>
        <p>I'm sure they were. It's really messed up. Did you see it on the news?</p>
        <p>When did you see it?</p>
        <p>What did it say?</p>
        <p>It was everywhere?</p>
        <p>May 8: the 9:11 a.m. from Port Washington to Manhattan. A woman loudly repeats her office and cell-phone numbers into her phone, then adds:</p>
        <p>I would prefer it if you wouldn't call me at the office because I don't have much privacy there.</p>
