        <p>IF the Le Petit Cafe in Branford were a movie, it might be titled ''The Miracle on Montowese Street.'' What other way is there to describe a restaurant that is able to serve a memorable prix fixe dinner for $35?</p>
        <p>This tiny enterprise facing the Branford green opened several years ago. It was then sold to Roy and Winnie Ip, who for a brief time turned it into a gourmet market and catering service.</p>
        <p>The Ips recently converted the minuscule space back to a cafe while continuing the catering service. The lively cafe, with maximum seating for 50, serves appealing French food at very reasonable prices.</p>
        <p>There are five courses with six diverse choices in the entrée and dessert categories.</p>
        <p>At the first seating, the staff maintained an alert and effortless pace without hurrying to set up for the second group. The only flaw was when a new waiter forgot to bring us our wine and coffee.</p>
        <p>Our first two courses, salad and an appetizer platter, arrived at the same time. It was a bit of a squeeze on our small table, which was already set with a bread basket, a saucer of zesty olives and a vase of fresh flowers.</p>
        <p>The appetizers included fresh asparagus stalks with ribbons of béarnaise sauce (lovely), slices of a coarse-textured pâté of pork, chicken livers and applewood-smoked bacon, along with garlic, shallots, brandy and white wine, served with cornichons (robustly satisfying), a ceviche of tiny shrimp, scallops and squid (piquant and refreshing) and pickled beets.</p>
        <p>(The beets are usually not a favorite of ours, but in this case they were a tantalizingly complex: roasted and combined with pickled lemon, fennel, red pepper flakes, mint, grated ginger, sugar and salt, marinated in red wine vinegar.)</p>
        <p>The organic mesclun salad, a generous mix of fresh, varied greens, arrived with an edgy vinaigrette of balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard on the side. It was a perfect appetite arouser.</p>
        <p>A vegan soup, an earthy purée of sweet corn and wild mushrooms, followed. Vegan means that no animal products were used during preparation. The soup, laced indiscernibly with a soupcon of olive oil, was intense and fulfilling.</p>
        <p>The menu changes twice monthly, so you might encounter some of the entrée choices we had. The four of us selected different dishes and they were all rewarding. One selection was a soft-shell crab grenobloise (sautéed in brown butter and lemon with capers and finely diced radishes) accompanied by steamed cauliflower (bland). Another was the roasted duck breast (sliced and rare as ordered) and leg confit, in a not-too-sweet black cherry sauce, served along with haricots verts and an excellent sweet potato gratinée. We also ordered the roasted rack of lamb Provençal with herb root vegetables and rosemary sauce (perfection), and the Angus steak au poivre ''Le Petit Cafe'' in a luscious sauce of brandy and black peppercorn, along with crisp French fries.</p>
        <p>The generous side dishes of oven-hot spinach gratinée and mashed potatoes (served family style) more than compensated for the dreary cauliflower.</p>
        <p>For dessert, we opted for a felicitous threesome: crispy apple tart (thinly sliced Golden Delicious apples spread fan-like on a superb, thin crust, etched with caramel sauce); the rum-flavored bread pudding baked with Burgundy-poached pears, prunes, raisins and almonds (rich and complex) and, best of all, a devastating chocolate cake (flourless) in a tangy raspberry sauce.</p>
        <p>All three desserts were served warm with scoops of crème Chantilly.</p>
        <p>A limited wine list features mostly French and West Coast American selections, priced from $25.</p>
        <p>How such satisfying meals can be served at such a low price is for Le Petit Cafe to know and the rest of us to enjoy.</p>
        <p>This little gem of a cafe, while widely known in the Branford area, will be a rare discovery for anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food, a friendly, spirited atmosphere, and arguably the best dollar value to be found anywhere in Connecticut.</p>

        <p>ATMOSPHERE A French-style cafe with mustard-color plastered walls chock-a-block with posters, signs, shelves of knickknacks and huge mirrors to enlarge the very limited room.</p>
