        <p>Fearful of the blackouts and price spikes that have afflicted California, most other states expect to slow or even halt efforts to deregulate their electricity markets, according to a survey of utility regulators that is to be released late this week.</p>
        <p>The survey polled public utility commissioners and members of their staffs in 45 states and the District of Columbia from Dec. 1 to Jan. 31, just as rolling blackouts and threats of utility bankruptcies shook California.</p>
        <p>Nearly 75 percent of the state utility commissioners interviewed ''expect the California situation will either stop or decelerate restructuring in their states,'' according to the survey, by RKS Research and Consulting, a market research firm specializing in the energy industry. State legislatures usually draft deregulation programs, but with significant input from the regulators.</p>
        <p>Only 40 percent of utility commissioners thought they had the regulatory and legislative tools to prevent a California-type situation from occurring in their states. As a result, states like New Mexico, Nevada and Oklahoma are taking a much more cautious, incremental approach to restructuring their electricity industries.</p>
        <p>''California highlighted what can go wrong, so states are going to be much more careful,'' said Richard Cortright, a director in the utility ratings group of Standard &amp; Poor's, among the companies that commissioned the RKS study. ''What California did, they're not going to do.''</p>
        <p>So far, 24 states and the District of Columbia have begun deregulation, though that number may change as legislatures slow or even reverse the process. Most states that are hesitating are in the South, the Midwest and the West, the survey found.</p>
        <p>Deregulation there has generally unfolded slowly, because the issue lacked the same urgency it had in pioneering states like California, New York and Pennsylvania. Lawmakers in those states thought they needed to take drastic action to drive down historically high electricity prices that had crippled business. But states like Oklahoma, with low electricity rates, have the luxury to hold off on deregulation for the time being.</p>
        <p>''I think the process is stalled here because we're a low-cost state,'' said Bob Anthony, chairman of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the state's utility regulator.''I'm not persuaded that electricity restructuring as outlined in our Legislature would be better than what we have now. We don't want to get snakebit.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the survey found that in regions where few states have deregulated, most regulators believed that consumers were better served by traditional, regulated utilities.</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, by contrast, where most states have already restructured their electricity industries, 71 percent of respondents said deregulated markets worked better.</p>
        <p>Those views will likely be put to the test this summer, noted David J. Reichman, chief executive of RKS.  Because last summer was unseasonably cool in the Northeast, demand for electricity in the newly deregulated markets in New York and Pennsylvania seldom rose sharply, and prices were dampened. But this summer is expected to be typically sultry, and the price of power could thus soar, analysts have warned.</p>
        <p>Mirroring an opinion common among industry experts, the regulators surveyed said they thought that California's crisis stemmed mainly from not having enough power plants and transmission lines to satisfy the state's enormous appetite for electricity, and from serious flaws in the design of the wholesale markets where power is bought and sold.</p>
        <p>New Mexico, once on the road to restructuring, has decided to wait another five years until more power plants and transmission lines are built in the West. A handful of regulators in other states, including Texas and Michigan, said they were going ahead with deregulation because they had already instituted safeguards to help avert blackouts and price spikes.</p>
        <p>Michigan, for example, has difficulty importing power because as a peninsula, it has only four transmission lines from other states. As its deregulation plan progresses, more power plants are being built in the state, and local utilities have to come up with a plan to increase transmission capacity into Michigan by 50 percent by June 2002.</p>
        <p>Events in California have yet to raise worries in Michigan, which has been developing a deregulation plan since 1992, said Thomas S. Stanton, a spokesman for the state's Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>''Nothing in the last six months has had any impact,'' Mr. Stanton said. ''But the people who were working on the design of the Michigan program now have perfect hindsight of some of the things we did differently that will benefit the market.''</p>
