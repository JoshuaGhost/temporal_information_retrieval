        <p>Philadelphia seems to have a fondness for offbeat museums, including Shoe Museum, Mutter Museum of medical history, Insectarium, Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society and National Liberty Museum; photo (M)</p>

        <p>MADRID has its Prado, Paris has its Louvre, and other cities have some version or other of the Guggenheim. But here in the Cradle of Liberty, we revel in the offbeat.</p>
        <p>Yes, we have an art museum of world renown, but we also have Grover Cleveland's cancerous jawbone, Ulysses S. Grant's dinner plates, Ella Fitzgerald's favorite shoes, perhaps the only extant piece of Cervantes's handwriting and, just outside the city, a museum devoted to one of the worst baseball teams in major league history.</p>
        <p>These go along with innumerable historic markers seemingly immortalizing any moderately famous person who ever spent a moment in town. Even W. C. Fields, that famous Philadelphia disdainer, gets his due with a marker outside Strawbridge's department store, where he apparently worked as a youth.</p>
        <p>Of course, other places have their odd museums and museums of oddities. But Philadelphia seems to have a special attraction for them. ''As long as there's been a Philadelphia, we've had a specialty in creating and keeping unique organizations,'' said Ken Finkel, the editor of a wry but comprehensive annual, the Philadelphia Almanac and Citizens Manual. ''It's a practice that runs long and deep. We pretty much own American history here, so, of course, boutique museums are going to be part of this rich civic scene.''</p>
        <p>Start Off on the Right Foot</p>
        <p>During the Bicentennial in 1976, Philadelphia's party planners were looking for attractions to satisfy the expected hordes of visitors. The Shoe Museum, housed in Temple University's podiatry school a few blocks from Independence Hall, was part of that push.</p>
        <p>Spread in cases and along walls of halls near the sixth-floor classroom areas, the collection pays homage to foot coverings from all around the world. There are shoes that belonged to recent first ladies (only Betty Ford's silver sandals look comfortable); a size 20 from a woman who suffered from gigantism; Egyptian burial sandals dated 200 B.C., and  white shoes adorned with a black star, formerly Ringo Starr's.</p>
        <p>The curator, Barbara Williams, will pull out special items if you ask, like Eskimo boots that look like baskets.</p>
        <p>Shoe Museum, Eighth and Race Streets, Philadelphia. (215) 625-5243; http://podiatry.temple.edu/shoemus .htm.</p>
        <p>Organ Donations Welcome</p>
        <p>There are few institutions as unintentionally macabre as the Mütter Museum. In 1859, Dr. Thomas Mütter donated his own collection of bones, specimens and models to start a museum of medical history at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Since then, the collection has grown to more than 20,000 items. There are 900 fluid-preserved specimens, including fetuses and organs, and a wall of skulls used for medical research dozens of years ago. The Mütter has President Cleveland's jawbone, Chief Justice John Marshall's gallstones and John Wilkes Booth's thorax. There are horns that supposedly grew on people's foreheads and coins that came from people's stomachs. All of this, and much more, is in a beautiful but dark, old stone building. The lighting, suitably, is eerie.</p>
        <p>Mütter Museum, 19 South 22nd Street, Philadelphia. (215) 563-3737;  www.collphyphil.org/muttpg1.shtml.</p>
        <p>Where the Exhibitions Crawl</p>
        <p>The busy workers on the first floor of the three-story office building on a commercial strip in working-class northeast Philadelphia seem to sense no irony. They work for Steve's Bug-Off, an exterminating business in the building, and politely send you upstairs when you ask about the Insectarium, an eight-year-old, two-floor paean to creatures with at least six legs.</p>
        <p>Upstairs are thousands of mounted butterflies and moths and bugs of all colors and shapes and origins. But there are also exhibits you might call interactive. Faith Kuehn, the staff entomologist, will let you tickle a live Madagascar hissing roach, which shoots out air when danger is near. Or maybe you'll like the petting zoo, near the corner of Spider Street and Arachnid Alley, with scorpions and velvet ants and death-feigning beetles, which drop over somnolent to ward off attackers looking for live food.</p>
        <p>Birthday parties are popular at the Insectarium. As Dr. Kuehn said, ''Kids love things that move.''</p>
        <p>The showstopper on the second floor is the life-size Roach Kitchen. Behind seven-foot-high plexiglass is a swarm of plain old American cockroaches crawling over a stove and refrigerator, fed moldy food by Dr. Kuehn and her minions.</p>
        <p>''It's there for the gross-out factor,'' she said. ''Kids love that, too.''</p>
        <p>Insectarium, 8046 Frankford Avenue, Philadelphia. (215) 338-3000; www.insectarium.com.</p>
        <p>Root, Root, Root</p>
        <p>Philadelphia once had a baseball team that won three straight pennants. Another time it won four out of five.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this was not the Phillies. Even more unfortunately, none of those pennants came after 1931. But for a time, the Philadelphia Athletics were the best baseball team in the American League.</p>
        <p>That changed as the Depression continued. The team's owner and manager, Connie Mack, needed money and sold his best players, and the A's became perennial losers. Finally, in 1954, the A's moved to Kansas City, and in 1968, after more losing years, to Oakland.</p>
        <p>The A's Museum, however, remains. It has gloves, bats, shirts and programs from the good years and bad. There's a 1941 letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mack and another, more sentimental, from the slugger Jimmie Foxx to a young fan, Jimmy McHugh, which reads in part, ''As we both have the same first name, we must stick together.''</p>
        <p>Said Ted Taylor, the founder of the Philadelphia A's Historical Society, ''We've tried to start a National Association of Defunct Baseball Teams.'' But, he added, ''we're the only one with a museum. Perhaps Philadelphians are just more of a sentimental lot.''</p>
        <p>Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society, 6 North York Road, Hatboro.  www.philadelphiaathletics.org; (215) 323-9901.</p>
        <p>Liberty, Clear and Fragile</p>
        <p>Irvin Borowsky, a publisher of trade magazines, had long been a collector of glass art and a believer in the need to vanquish violence and bigotry. Two years ago, he finally combined the two passions in a building across the street from Independence National Historic Park.</p>
        <p>''Glass is fragile, just like liberty,'' Mr. Borowsky said. ''It can be smashed by violence.'' Running entirely through the museum's three floors is the museum's centerpiece, the fire-red, hydralike Flame of Liberty, by Mr. Borowsky's favorite glass sculptor, Dale Chihuly. Glass sculptures from a dozen other countries are on display, among exhibits about freedom.</p>
        <p>Glass sculptures from a dozen other countries are also on view, but Mr. Borowsky, who shows up often, always directs young visitors to the Jelly-Bean People -- two glass-sculpture children filled with jelly beans to signify that everyone is multicolored and diverse underneath.</p>
