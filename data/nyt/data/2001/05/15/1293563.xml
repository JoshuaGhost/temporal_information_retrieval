        <p>Two independent agencies in California -- Italia/Gal in Los Angeles and Zuckerman Fernandes &amp; Partners in San Francisco -- said yesterday that they were merging to form G/F/D/M. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>''We were doing well, and here was a chance to align ourselves with a group of people and do even better,'' said Ken Gal, president and chief executive at Italia/Gal, who will continue in that post at the merged agency.</p>
        <p>In July 2000, Italia/Gal agreed to merge with Asher &amp; Partners to form Asher/Gal &amp; Partners, a deal that changed by April when, Mr. Gal said, Italia/Gal instead bought the clients and fixed assets of Asher &amp; Partners. Executives at Asher &amp; Partners could not be reached yesterday for comment.</p>
        <p>Italia/Gal brings about 40 employees and billings estimated at $50 million from clients like the State of Oregon Department of Health and Shakey's Pizza; and Zuckerman Fernandes, about 30 employees and billings estimated at $50 million from clients like Stuart Anderson's Black Angus Restaurants and the Union Bank of California. The combined agency will have 70 employees working out of the Los Angeles and San Francisco offices and billings estimated at more than $100 million.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Gal, 44, who will hold a controlling interest in the merged agency, there are three other principals. Al Fernandes, 41, executive creative director at Zuckerman Fernandes, becomes president and executive creative director at the San Francisco office. The two others, previously employees at Asher &amp; Partners, are: Bruce Dundore, 44, now executive creative director at the Los Angeles office, and Leah Mitchell, 48, director for media services. Ira Zuckerman, chairman and chief executive at Zuckerman &amp; Partners, will be the chairman at G/F/D/M and serve as a consultant to the San Francisco office.</p>
