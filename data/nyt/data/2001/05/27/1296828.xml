        <p>SOMETHING struck Paul Morsen as odd about a trash hauler's request that the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District approve higher rates for customers to keep it out of bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>After all, just weeks earlier, this trash hauler, Orinda-Moraga Disposal Service Inc., said it could lower the cost of collecting garbage for customers.</p>
        <p>''Both those things can't be true,'' because no rational company offers to cut prices when it is losing money, said Mr. Morsen, who at the time -- the summer of 1996 -- was deputy general manager of the Sanitary District.</p>
        <p>So he called in a forensic accountant, Dan W. Ray. Mr. Ray's profession is a bit of an oxymoron. The very word forensic sounds glamorous and perhaps a little scary -- forensic psychology seems to crop up in conversations about Thomas Harris's fictional cannibalistic shrink, Hannibal Lecter; forensic pathologists helped identify the deceased victims of violence in Argentina and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>At the same time, accounting is renowned for being, well, a snore. Not this kind. As the economic climate has worsened and investors have started prowling restlessly for evidence of past corporate sins -- overstated costs or revenue, for example, or understated inventory -- forensic accounting is in demand.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to tell how great the demand is, though -- clients of forensic accountants do not usually want to advertise that they lost track of money they now have to find. But, to name just a few recent cases, Xerox is using accountants to investigate its finances and Cendant hired Arthur Andersen to sort out possible accounting irregularities in the wake of fraud accusations that surfaced last year.</p>
        <p>Forensic accounting experts are also hired by defendants in fraud cases. Lawyers for Albert J. Dunlap, the former Sunbeam Corporation chairman and chief executive accused this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission of accounting fraud, hired forensic accounting experts at PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine Sunbeam's books.</p>
        <p>''It is a growth industry,'' said John Warren, associate general counsel of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, an organization in Austin, Tex. The group has added nearly 3,300 accountants to its membership rolls in the last 10 years and plans to add an additional 1,500 this year. ''It has a lot to do with organizations being more aware of the threat of white-collar crime.''</p>
        <p>STRICTLY speaking, forensic accounting is audit work performed to help in litigation, but it usually refers to the investigation of an individual's or a corporation's finances to find missing money. The practice is not limited to big accounting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte &amp; Touche, though they are expanding their business. Many small firms and solo practitioners are out there, too.</p>
        <p>There is no typical case of fraud, but the Contra Costa trash story illustrates how forensic accountants work. The first thing Mr. Ray did was check a database to see whether William D. Lomow, the owner of the trash hauler, owned other California companies that could be involved in any scheme. It turned out that he did.</p>
        <p>So early in the investigation, which was allowed by the terms of the contract between the sanitary authority and the trash company, Mr. Ray asked Mr. Lomow whether he owned any other companies.</p>
        <p>''He said no, and that was the wrong answer,'' Mr. Ray recalled. ''It told me I was dealing with someone who wasn't truthful. I describe it as my 'litmus test of management integrity.' And he failed.''</p>
        <p>Alerted that the owner was probably hiding something, the accountants reviewed payments the company made, and found a check payable to a Bay Area company deposited in a bank in Boise, Idaho, where Mr. Lomow had a personal account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ray checked the name of the owner of the company that made the deposit and found that the same person -- who, it turned out, did not exist -- owned other companies.  All were recipients of checks from the trash company, all were founded on the same day, and all had fictitious business addresses, such as a Mailboxes Etc. outlet in Berkeley, Calif., a vacant building, or a Post Office drop box, Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>It turned out that the other companies, supposedly providing maintenance services for garbage trucks, were dummy corporations established by Mr. Lomow to siphon money from the trash company, Mr. Ray said. Mr. Lomow overstated costs to justify rate increases, and then the payments made by the company went straight into bank accounts under his control, Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>The Sanitary District took the paper trail that Mr. Ray's team had uncovered and used it in a civil lawsuit against Mr. Lomow and his associate, Robert M. Sliepka. The district obtained a $9 million judgment, and at least part of the money recovered will be repaid to customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lomow and Mr. Sliepka were convicted in criminal proceedings. The failure of outside auditors to discover the fraud led to a malpractice lawsuit against the Sanitary District's outside accountants, too, Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>''It certainly had a great outcome,'' said Mr. Ray. He expects to see an increase in dot-com related cases soon, because his firm is near Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>The trash case is unusual in that most of the details became public. Usually the clients of forensic accountants prefer to keep all information secret, so they do not publicize their vulnerability to fraud. Many of the stories that the accountants tell are therefore vague. For example, Howard M. Fielstein, a partner at Margolin, Winer &amp; Evens in New York, tells of the management of a scrap metal reseller that kept running out of metal to sell, though its inventory records showed that all orders should have been met easily.</p>
        <p>''It turned out that over the weekend, trucks were coming in and just loading it up'' to sell elsewhere, Mr. Fielstein said. That case was broken by surveillance of the building where the scrap metal was stored, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fielstein's formula for conducting a forensic accounting investigation draws heavily on interviews, first of the potential client. ''They should be 100 percent upfront,'' he said. Otherwise, Mr. Fielstein said, his own reputation could be damaged.</p>
        <p>The next step is to review what documentation there is, and then to interview those people who might know what caused a discrepancy in a company's finances. Not just the chief financial officer, either, Mr. Fielstein emphasizes.</p>
        <p>''You can learn a lot from not only talking to the upper levels but also to the guy who walks the floor,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some forensic accountants are actually much closer to private investigators. Kroll, the risk-management company, for example, offers to vet potential employees, advises companies on how to protect secrets and performs miscellaneous other services intended to reduce the risks clients face.</p>
        <p>The work can get dangerous, said James R. Murray, senior managing director for Kroll in New York. ''We're constantly assessing that,'' he said. ''Most of the time you don't have too many concerns. White-collar criminals are usually not violent.''</p>
        <p>Forensic accountants often get called in to help with more mundane matters, like divorces. Wealthy spouses often go to extraordinary lengths to hide assets so they are not consumed by alimony payments, and accountants may have to pore over bank and real estate records to find them.</p>
        <p>When a publicly held company is involved, or the case receives significant attention, it is sometimes important to the client to send a message that cooking the books will be punished. In order to do that, the victim of fraud may turn over all the information uncovered by a forensic accountant to prosecutors, who may bring criminal proceedings against the culprit, as in the Contra Costa trash case.</p>
        <p>XEROX has said that the lawyers for its audit committee have retained PricewaterhouseCoopers to review their books, for example, in the wake of an S.E.C. investigation of some Xerox accounting practices.</p>
        <p>Forensic accounting work is not necessarily more lucrative than more traditional audit work, but its practitioners, all of them certified public accountants, say they much prefer the challenges of their current work to reviewing corporations' books.</p>
        <p>''It causes you to use more of your imagination,'' Mr. Fielstein said, because every scam is unique. ''There's always something different out there.''</p>
