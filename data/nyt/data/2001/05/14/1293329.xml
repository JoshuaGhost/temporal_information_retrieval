        <p>Basque nationalists won a bitterly contested regional election today, crushing the hopes of mainstream Spanish parties to seize the initiative in the country's troubled northern region.</p>
        <p>Voters rejected warnings from the national government in Madrid that a victory for moderate nationalists would mean support for the armed separatist group E.T.A., which is blamed for almost 800 killings in the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>The moderate Basque Nationalist Party won 42.7 percent of the vote, which will give it 33 seats in the 75-member regional Parliament in Vitoria. The combined nationalist tally accounted for more than 52 percent of the vote, but Basque society remains deeply divided over the issue of independence.</p>
        <p>With nearly 100 percent of the ballots counted, results showed the moderate nationalists short of a majority, but Juan José Ibarretxe, their candidate to head the regional government, is likely to win backing from the United Left, which holds three seats.</p>
        <p>The Basque Nationalist Party's president, Xabier Arzalluz, told a cheering crowd gathered inside and outside a Bilbao hotel, ''We did not beat the Popular Party or the Socialist Party but the whole state,'' a reference to the main national parties, which favored stronger ties with Madrid.</p>
        <p>Supporters waved the red, white and green Basque flag and responded with cries of ''Madrid is burning!'' They also chanted ''Independence, independence,'' apparently enjoying the feeling of vindication.</p>
        <p>''We've won by miles, even after the way that the central government and all Spaniards have demonized us,'' said Iranzu Muruaga, 29, an accountant. ''It proves that the Basque people do not think that, and that we have chosen the path of peace.''</p>
        <p>The two major parties, adversaries in the national arena, suggested that they were willing to form an unusual partnership to oust the Basque nationalists from the regional Parliament for the first time since its creation in 1977 after Spain's transition to democracy. But combined, they only mustered 32 seats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ibarretxe thanked voters for ''opening to door to peace'' and dialogue. And, bruised by a vitriolic campaign against his party, he told cheering supporters that there was only one way to resolve the Basque problem: ''to sit down and talk like people, not animals.''</p>
        <p>The election brought bitter disappointment to the center-right Popular Party of Prime Minister José María Aznar and the opposition Socialists alike. They campaigned vigorously against the moderate Basque party, accusing it of complicity with terrorism for having signed a failed peace pact with the radicals of Euskal Herritarrok, the party widely seen as E.T.A.'s political wing.</p>
        <p>And they argued against negotiating with the armed separatist group -- whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language -- saying it should be destroyed by police action.</p>
        <p>Euskal Herritarrok was the biggest loser of the night, losing 7 of the 14 seats it held in the regional Parliament. Voters may have been expressing their opposition to attacks by E.T.A., which included a car bombing in Madrid and the assassination of a senator in the last week.</p>
        <p>The party's leader, Arnaldo Otegi, applauded the defeat of ''the Spanish unionists'' and called on the moderate Basque nationalists to join forces with him. But Mr. Ibarretxe has sworn to deal neither ''directly nor indirectly'' with Euskal Herritarrok.</p>
        <p>Turnout in the election, which was described as crucial by all sides, reached 80 percent. That was up from 70 percent during the last regional election in 1998, which took place during a 15-month cease-fire by the armed group, which was seen as having helped Euskal Herritarrok. This time, many of its voters appear to have switched to the moderate nationalists, a development applauded by the other parties.</p>
        <p>Jaime Mayor Oreja, the hard-line former interior minister who led the Popular Party's campaign, admitted disappointment at the results but praised the fact that ''this society has reduced by half its support for terrorism and fear.''</p>
        <p>Despite tensions raised by the car-bomb attack in Madrid and the killing in Zaragoza of Senator Manuel Giménez Abad, an official of Prime Minister Aznar's party, the voting went quietly at most of the 738 polling places, guarded by a police contingent that totaled 5,000.</p>
