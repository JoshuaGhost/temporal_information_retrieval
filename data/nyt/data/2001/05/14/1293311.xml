        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation came under scathing criticism today from Capitol Hill, with Democratic and Republican lawmakers describing the mishandling of documents in the Timothy J. McVeigh case as the latest in several fiascoes that appeared to reflect deep problems within the agency.</p>
        <p>One critic, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was openly skeptical of the bureau's explanation that a flawed database rather than broader mismanagement lay at the root of the problem, which surfaced just days before Mr. McVeigh was scheduled to be executed for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing. The foul-up has forced the Justice Department to postpone the execution at least until June 11.</p>
        <p>Attorney General John Ashcroft has already ordered the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate why the bureau failed until last week to turn over thousands of pages of interview reports and related materials that should have been given to Mr. McVeigh's lawyers before his trial in 1996. But the lawmakers went further today, saying that this F.B.I. lapse and others called out for Congress or a presidential commission to examine what they called matters of culture and competence.</p>
        <p>''When you have on major case after major case after major case, mistake after mistake after mistake, it's time for a thorough and complete re-examination,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation.'' A Senate subcommittee is to begin such a review soon, Mr. Schumer said, and he called on President Bush to assemble leading law-enforcement officials to conduct ''a top-to-bottom review'' of the bureau.</p>
        <p>Appearing separately on Sunday television programs, the lawmakers cited what they called F.B.I. bungling in a number of other high-profile cases, including the fatal assaults that ended standoffs between federal agents and citizens in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992 and against the Branch Davidians' complex near Waco, Tex., in 1993. They also mentioned the bureau's failure until this year to arrest one of its agents, Robert P. Hanssen, who has been accused of espionage dating back many years.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a management culture here that's at fault,'' Senator Grassley said on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''I call it a 'cowboy culture.' It's kind of a culture that puts image, public relations and headlines ahead of the fundamentals of the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>It remained unclear today how or whether the latest lapse, in the McVeigh case, might affect the final outcome of what was the worst case of domestic terrorism in the United States and what was to have been the first federal execution in 38 years. The execution was postponed to allow Mr. McVeigh's lawyers time to review more than 3,000 pages of documents that were not surrendered until last week by F.B.I. field offices.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Ashcroft and other law enforcement officials in the Bush administration have said there is no evidence that the documents were deliberately withheld by anyone, and they say nothing in them changes the fact of Mr. McVeigh's guilt. Mr. McVeigh, 33, was convicted and sentenced to death in 1997 for the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, and he has since acknowledged his guilt.</p>
        <p>But lawyers for Mr. McVeigh said today that they were studying ''all options'' in light of the belated emergence of the documents. ''We're looking for anything that provides an arguable basis to go to court and seek relief,'' one lawyer, Nathan D. Chambers, said on ''This Week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chambers and a second lawyer, Robert Nigh Jr., said it was important that they determine how the mistake could have been made. The lawyers have left open the possibility that they might challenge Mr. McVeigh's conviction or his death sentence, and they said today that it might take longer than the 30 days allowed under the reprieve for them to complete their legal review.</p>
        <p>A request for a further reprieve would be subject to approval by a judge, and would probably set up a new clash with the Justice Department. Mr. Ashcroft was quoted today in The Daily Oklahoman as saying that ''ample time'' had been given to the defense lawyers and that he had ''no intention'' of extending the June 11 execution date.</p>
        <p>In their television appearances today, the lawmakers who were critical of the F.B.I. said that they had no doubt about Mr. McVeigh's guilt. But some, including Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that any suppression of evidence against Mr. McVeigh could also constitute a crime.</p>
        <p>''If we find deliberate concealment, that's obstruction of justice, and people ought to go to jail,'' Senator Specter said on ''Fox News Sunday.''</p>
