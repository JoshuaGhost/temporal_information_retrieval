        <p>The New England Revolution has rescued itself in a span of eight days. The Revolution, which lost its first six Major League Soccer games, posted its third consecutive victory, a 1-0 decision over the host Colorado Rapids, last Saturday. MATT OKOH celebrated his 29th birthday by scoring on a penalty kick with four minutes left.</p>
        <p>New England was awarded the penalty kick when CATé, the Brazilian midfielder who scored both goals in the Revolution's 2-1 victory over Columbus last Wednesday, was pulled down in the penalty area by Colorado's CHRIS MARTINEZ.

        <p>The New England Revolution has rescued itself in a span of eight days. The Revolution, which lost its first six Major League Soccer games, posted its third consecutive victory, a 1-0 decision over the host Colorado Rapids, last Saturday. MATT OKOH celebrated his 29th birthday by scoring on a penalty kick with four minutes left.</p>
        <p>New England was awarded the penalty kick when CATé, the Brazilian midfielder who scored both goals in the Revolution's 2-1 victory over Columbus last Wednesday, was pulled down in the penalty area by Colorado's CHRIS MARTINEZ. For his outstanding play in the two games, Caté was named the league's player of the week.</p>
        <p>''The guys are all on the same page right now,'' said FERNANDO CLAVIJO, whose job appeared to be in jeopardy because of the the Revolution's early troubles. He and TODD SMITH, the general manager, traded ERIC WYNALDA and JOHN HARKES, two former stars of the United States national team. ''I can leave the locker room now and there won't be any complaints,'' Clavijo said. ''No one is pointing fingers anymore, and the guys are willing to work for each other.''</p>
        <p>In Columbus, a coaching change helped inspire the Crew, which won for the second time this season, 2-1 in overtime against D.C. United. JEFF CUNNINGHAM scored the game-winner for the Crew (2-3-2), which played two men short for the final 32 minutes.</p>
        <p>GREG ANDRULIS, who replaced TOM FITZGERALD as coach, refused to take credit for the victory. If the credit is to me, it's misplaced, Andrulis said. The players deserved all the credit because no one got down after the first or second red card.</p>
        <p>The defending M.L.S. champion Kansas City Wizards lost their third straight, this time to the Chicago Fire. The Fire's 2-0 triumph, before a crowd of 20,302, increased its home undefeated streak to 14 games. DEMA KOVALENKO and PETER NOWAK scored for the Fire (4-2-1), who are first in the Central Division.</p>
        <p>METROSTARS</p>
        <p>This is another busy week for the MetroStars, who have the best record in M.L.S. The MetroStars (6-2-1) will play three games in seven days for the second consecutive week.</p>
        <p>This one started with a 2-0 loss to the Earthquakes in San Jose last Saturday, will continue with a road game Thursday night against Kansas City and will conclude with an exhibition match against Bayern Munich on Saturday night at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars looked sluggish in the loss to San Jose, which halted their five-game winning streak. Coach OCTAVIO ZAMBRANO gave his team two days off after Saturday's game, in which the MetroStars allowed goals to WADE BARRETT and LANDON DONOVAN. It was the 19-year-old Donovan's first M.L.S. goal.</p>
        <p>Bayern Munich captured the German championship last Saturday and will play in the European Champions League final tomorrow against Valencia of Spain in Milan. Bayern's visit to the MetroStars was part of the deal that brought LOTHAR MATTHäUS to the MetroStars last season.</p>
        <p>W.U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Effective defensive play has spearheaded the New York Power to the top of the Women's United Soccer Association. The Power, coached by PAT FARMER, has allowed only three goals in five games. The Power's defense was so good in the 1-0 victory in San Diego on Sunday that it limited the Spirit to two shots by SHANNON MacMILLAN.</p>
        <p>MIA HAMM and the Washington Freedom will visit this coming Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Freedom allowed Carolina to rally from a two-goal deficit to earn a tie and its first point in five games.</p>
        <p>Washington, Boston and Philadelphia are tied for second, just a point behind the Power, which has 9 points.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES</p>
        <p>Forty-seven groups nationwide were awarded nearly $2 million by the United States Soccer Foundation, highlighted by a $106,000 award to fund a study of the effects of heading the ball on players' cognitive functions. The five-year study will be undertaken by the United States Soccer Federation and its medical professionals.</p>
        <p>The scientific study will be spearheaded by DONALD KIRKENDALL, the orthopedic clinical assistant professor at the University of North Carolina.</p>
