        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., acting just ahead of an expected Ford effort to replace as many as 13 million more Firestone tires on its Explorer sport utility vehicles, said today that it would stop selling tires to Ford.</p>
        <p>Firestone accused Ford of questioning the safety of its tires to divert attention from problems with the Explorer, in which more than 100 people have died in tire-related crashes -- almost all rollovers.</p>
        <p>The announcement, which severs an almost century-old corporate relationship, revived a national controversy over tire and vehicle safety that began last August, when Firestone, at Ford's request, recalled 6.5 million tires supplied as factory equipment on Explorers.</p>
        <p>A statistical analysis prepared about a month ago by Ford -- and shared last Thursday with regulators without Firestone's knowledge -- found that the remaining Firestone tires on Explorers also have higher rates of problems than tires made by other manufacturers, although not nearly as high as the tires already recalled. Ford has secretly been preparing to replace the rest of the Firestone tires for customers at its own expense, with an announcement expected on Tuesday, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>The recall last August covered 14.4 million tires produced from 1990 through January 2000, of which only 6.5 million were believed to be still in use. The recall did not cover another 16 million or more Firestone tires made for Explorers since 1996, which Ford and Firestone insisted were safe. Firestone says it does not know how many of these are still in use; outside estimates range from 10 million to 13 million.</p>
        <p>General Motors constantly reviews the safety of the tires it buys and has detected no problems with Firestone tires, said Terry Rhadigan, a G.M. spokesman. It plans to continue buying tires from Firestone, he added.</p>
        <p>Nissan Motor, another big Firestone customer, also said that it had not found problems with the tires and would continue buying them.</p>
        <p>John T. Lampe, Firestone's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview today that he halted Firestone's business with Ford during a meeting early this morning at Firestone's headquarters in Nashville with Carlos Mazzorin, Ford's group vice president for purchasing.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mazzorin said Ford would not share its safety data on the Explorer, Mr. Lampe said that he handed him a letter terminating the companies' relationship. Mr. Lampe said that he had prepared the letter in advance with officials at Firestone's corporate parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan.</p>
        <p>''Business relationships, like personal ones, are built upon trust and mutual respect,'' Mr. Lampe wrote in the letter, which was addressed to Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president. ''We have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tires to Ford since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe went on to assert that Ford, not Firestone, should bear responsibility for the deadly problems that have appeared. ''Our analysis suggests that there are significant safety issues with a substantial segment of Ford Explorers,'' Mr. Lampe wrote. ''We have made your staff aware of our concerns. They have steadfastly refused to acknowledge those issues.''</p>
        <p>Ford defended the safety of its Explorers in a statement today, saying that 2.9 million Goodyear tires installed on Explorers in the mid-1990's had ''performed with industry-leading safety.''</p>
        <p>The letter ended one of the most enduring relationships in American industry, born of a friendship between the two companies' founders that preceded the establishment of either company. Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone used to go on long camping trips with Thomas Edison and John Burroughs, the naturalist. Large wooden busts of the four men help support the ceiling in the dance hall of Mr. Ford's mansion in Dearborn, Mich. One of Mr. Ford's grandsons married a granddaughter of Mr. Firestone, and the only son from that union, William C. Ford Jr., is now chairman of Ford Motor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe said that Ford researchers accompanying Mr. Mazzorin had presented their analysis of the Firestone tires. Mr. Lampe described the analysis as carefully constructed by Ford to show problems with the tires, not the Explorer. The analysis relied on flawed data, like statistics on the temperature of tire surfaces, instead of the interiors of tires, Mr. Lampe argued.</p>
        <p>''They made the data to say what they wanted the data to say,'' Mr. Lampe asserted.</p>
        <p>Firestone posted charts on its Internet site showing that according to the tire maker's calculations, Explorers had been in tire-related crashes up to 10 times as often as other vehicles equipped with the same tires and that these crashes had been more severe than those of other vehicles. Firestone's charts also showed that its tires, including those already recalled, had performed as well or better than tires from most other tire makers in tests conducted by Firestone.</p>
        <p>Whether Ford or Firestone is responsible, or whether both share blame, will be decided not by the companies but by regulators, judges -- and, ultimately, consumers, through their purchasing decisions.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is not expected to complete its investigation until late summer at the earliest and possibly not until next winter. That investigation is confined to whether the tires are defective; the agency is not seeking to analyze the Explorer's stability, having previously concluded that taller vehicles, including most sport utilities, are considerably more prone to rolling over than are lower-riding types of vehicles.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who led the Congressional investigation last autumn into the Explorer crashes, announced this afternoon that his office had been collecting data since January on tire problems with all models of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, minivans and station wagons.</p>
        <p>Although the review has not uncovered problems comparable to those in Explorers, it has raised enough questions for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, of which Mr. Tauzin is chairman, to continue its inquiry, a spokesman for Mr. Tauzin said.</p>
        <p>Firestone said it would continue delivering tires to Ford under contracts already in force, but these contracts typically last a year, suggesting that its business with Ford will disappear quickly. The tire maker said that Ford accounted for only 4 percent of its revenue. But, while figures were not immediately available, it is probable that a considerably larger percentage of Firestone tires go to Ford assembly plants. Tire makers sell huge numbers of tires to automakers at very low prices that allow little or no profit, in hopes that customers will later buy replacement tires of the same brand at much higher prices.</p>
        <p>Firestone officials said they were reviewing whether their company might have to reduce tire production or undertake other cutbacks in its operations, which employ 45,000 people in the Americas.</p>
        <p>Firestone is Bridgestone's unit for tire manufacturing and sales in the Americas. Bridgestone said in Tokyo that it hoped to continue supplying tires to Ford subsidiaries elsewhere.</p>
        <p>[In trading in Tokyo on Tuesday, Bridgestone was down 97 yen (79 cents) at midday, or 6.9 percent, to 1,302 yen ($10.61).]</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe said that the final breach in the relationship began last Friday morning, when he read an article in The New York Times. The article said that Ford had concluded that there were problems with Firestone tires that had not been recalled and shared this information with regulators, and that the company was leaning toward a demand that Firestone broaden its recall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe had just completed a visit to Firestone's operations in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and immediately drove to the airport in Mexico City. While waiting for a flight at 10:30 a.m., Mr. Lampe put in a call to Mr. Nasser to ask him what Ford was doing. But Mr. Nasser ''did not take the call and never did return my call,'' Mr. Lampe said this evening.</p>
        <p>Instead, Ford dispatched Mr. Mazzorin and the researchers to speak with Mr. Lampe this morning. Mr. Lampe said that Mr. Mazzorin did not mention any plans to stop buying tires with Firestone, but displayed no emotion when Mr. Lampe informed him at the end of the meeting that Firestone did not want to continue selling tires to Ford anyway.</p>
        <p>A federal study in February also found that Explorers were 16 times as likely as the typical family car to kill the other driver in a two-vehicle crash, a problem Ford has tried to address with changes in the 2002 model.</p>
        <p>The first recall covered all 15-inch Firestone ATX tires in the P235/75 size, as well as 15-inch Wilderness AT tires in the same size that were made in Decatur, Ill. The remaining tires at issue today are 15-inch Wilderness tires made at Firestone factories elsewhere, as well as 16-inch Wilderness tires of the P255/70 size mounted on Explorers. Ford plans to replace the tires first in a few hot-weather states, notably Texas, where virtually all of the tire failures have occurred -- usually in summer.</p>
        <p>Rival tire makers say that they have already made preparations to step up production of replacement tires for the Explorer, but will have to review their ability to supply other tires that Firestone sells to Ford. Firestone supplies 41 percent of Ford's tires, said David Zielasko, the publisher of Tire Business magazine.</p>
