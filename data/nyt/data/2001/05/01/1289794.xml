        <p>Fortunes turned in the first month of the baseball season. The Minnesota Twins are winning the way the Yankees usually do, and some of their boisterous fans treated the Yankees tonight the way visiting teams are welcomed in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>As Brad Radke pitched a complete game and edged Andy Pettitte and the Yankees, 2-1, a trickle of debris was tossed out of the stands in left field, where the former Twin Chuck Knoblauch is stationed. But when Radke struck out Jorge Posada to end the game and improve Minnesota's record to a stunning 18-6, a tidal wave of bottles, coins and paper goods hit the field. ''It took a lot of the fun out of the game for me, personally, and for a lot of the players,'' Twins Manager Tom Kelly said.</p>

        <p>Fortunes turned in the first month of the baseball season. The Minnesota Twins are winning the way the Yankees usually do, and some of their boisterous fans treated the Yankees tonight the way visiting teams are welcomed in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>As Brad Radke pitched a complete game and edged Andy Pettitte and the Yankees, 2-1, a trickle of debris was tossed out of the stands in left field, where the former Twin Chuck Knoblauch is stationed. But when Radke struck out Jorge Posada to end the game and improve Minnesota's record to a stunning 18-6, a tidal wave of bottles, coins and paper goods hit the field. ''It took a lot of the fun out of the game for me, personally, and for a lot of the players,'' Twins Manager Tom Kelly said.</p>
        <p>The behavior of a handful of fans in the crowd of 24,629 -- a relatively large number on a Monday night for this team -- will not change the fact that right now, the Twins are among the best teams in baseball, anchored by their strong starting pitching in April. Radke is 5-0 with a 2.23 earned run average; he allowed only six hits, walked one and struck out four against the Yankees, a team that has historically given him trouble. ''It's always nice to beat the champs,'' he said. ''They still have a heck of a team over there.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are 14-12 after an erratic April. The end of April is a theoretical benchmark for baseball teams, like the first 100 days for the president, and early evaluations can be made. The Yankees, despite many problems, posted a winning record in the first month -- their 10th straight April with a winning record, and one season short of the mark established by the Yankees during the 1941-51 seasons.</p>
        <p>The cleanup hitter Bernie Williams has only one hit in 11 at-bats with runners in scoring position, a performance due largely to the fact that he left the team for 11 days to be with his ailing father in Puerto Rico. He has struggled since returning. The infield defense has been abominable: third baseman Scott Brosius  has seven errors, shortstop Derek Jeter has six and Alfonso Soriano is still learning the nuances of second base.</p>
        <p>Jeter is not really hitting the way he usually does, with no homers and only four extra-base hits in his first 22 games. David Justice's batting average is sinking toward .250. Mike Mussina has one victory and Orlando Hern√°ndez is trying to find his command; their problems are part of the reason the Yankees had only one victory from a starting pitcher from April 10 to April 27.</p>
        <p>But their bullpen has been excellent and they have enough offense to stay close to the leaders in the American League East. It is as if they are biding their time, waiting for the defense to shore up, for Williams and Jeter to start hitting and for Mussina, Roger Clemens and Pettitte to begin dominating regularly.</p>
        <p>And Pettitte was very good tonight while dueling Radke. The velocity on Pettitte's fastball has increased by 2 to 4 miles an hour since he began training with Clemens last year, and there have been days when Pettitte has been able to pump fastballs past hitters. But the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre does not want this approach to become habit for Pettitte: From time to time, Stottlemyre will meet with Pettitte and remind him that he needs to continue throwing sinking fastballs.</p>
        <p>Pettitte, the sinkerball pitcher, struck out two in the first inning tonight, one in the second, another in the third, and one each in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh innings.</p>
        <p>But Pettitte might have gotten a little too aggressive in the second inning and it cost him a run. David Ortiz doubled over the head of right fielder Paul O'Neill with one out, and after Torii Hunter whiffed, Pettitte got ahead of first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, no balls and two strikes, before he dumped a single into short center field, allowing Ortiz to score the game's first run.</p>
        <p>No Yankee base runner reached third base in the first three innings against Radke.</p>
        <p>''He'll throw you any pitch in any count to anybody,'' Jeter said. With one out in the top of the fourth, however, Radke hung a high breaking ball that Tino Martinez slammed against the facing of the upper deck, his fifth homer of the season.</p>
        <p>Martinez led off the seventh with a single through the middle, and Posada -- who came into the game with 7 hits in 13 career at-bats against Radke, including two homers -- bashed a hard grounder to the right side. If it had gone a little farther left, it would have skittered along the artificial surface, probably reaching the right-field wall. As it was, however, second baseman Luis Rivas fielded the ball and started a 4-6-3 double play.</p>
        <p>Pettitte cut down Hunter on strikes again with two outs in the bottom of the seventh, and he challenged Mientkiewicz with a high fastball. Mientkiewicz slammed it over the baggie/right-field fence, and the Twins moved ahead, 2-1.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't get that fastball inside enough,'' Pettitte said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>SHANE SPENCER was activated from the 15-day disabled list and optioned to Class AAA Columbus, a move that was expected but still disappointed the outfielder, who is coming back from knee surgery. ''It's not my choice but I've got to deal with it,'' Spencer said before the Clippers' game Monday night.</p>
