        <p>A spokesman for Don King Productions said yesterday that a rematch between John Ruiz and Evander Holyfield for the World Boxing Association heavyweight title would be held in China.</p>
        <p>Neither a date nor site was announced, but the spokesman, who is familiar with the negotiations, called the bout pretty definite and said that Don King, the promoter, had recently returned from China with a signed contract.</p>
        <p>King is scheduled to return to China on Tuesday on a seven-day trip during which he will inspect the fight site, the spokesman said. A delegation from China is expected to join King Monday in Manhattan for a formal announcement of the rematch.</p>
        <p>Ruiz floored Holyfield in the 11th round of a bout in Las Vegas on March 3 to take the title.</p>
