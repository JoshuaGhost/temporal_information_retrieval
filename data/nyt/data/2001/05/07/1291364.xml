        <p>Early last year, when Charlie Sheen was chosen to replace Michael J. Fox on the ABC comedy ''Spin City,'' the show's producers, writers and cast knew that it was taking a substantive turn that could lead to disaster.</p>
        <p>After all, this sitcom about New York's City Hall was created for Mr. Fox, who played a deputy mayor. He reluctantly decided to leave the show after four years because his Parkinson's disease was growing worse. His image, onscreen and off, was cheerfully wholesome, almost innocent.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Sheen's flourishing acting career in movies like ''Wall Street'' and ''Platoon'' had been derailed by a bad-boy reputation that made him a familiar figure in supermarket tabloids. He partied and drank too much, used drugs, was a close buddy of Heidi Fleiss, the so-called Hollywood madam, and seemed a prime candidate for oblivion.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty unreliable,'' said Mr. Sheen, who had been treated several times for drug and alcohol problems. ''I probably wouldn't have hired me had I been ABC.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Sheen's surprise, and that of virtually everyone else connected with it, ''Spin City,'' now in its fifth season, has earned some of its highest ratings ever, drawing larger and younger audiences than the episodes that starred Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>It is conventional wisdom that a series with a new lead will not outperform its record with the original star. Earle Marsh, co-author with Tim Brooks of ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows'' (Ballantine Books), said that when Shelley Long left ''Cheers,'' television executives predicted doom. But after Kirstie Alley replaced Ms. Long, the show's ratings increased, he said, in part because the entire ensemble improved.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's ''Toma,'' an unsuccessful ABC police drama, was recast, retitled and changed in other ways to become ''Baretta,'' a hit that ran from 1975 to 1978. In 1987 Valerie Harper abruptly quit her NBC series, ''Valerie,'' about a harried woman named Valerie Hogan juggling family and career. Ms. Harper was replaced by Sandy Duncan, whose character was renamed Sandy Hogan. The show, retitled ''The Hogan Family,'' ran on NBC until 1990, when it moved to CBS for still another year.</p>
        <p>During Mr. Sheen's first few months on ''Spin City,'' its average number of viewers increased to 12.1 million from the 11.8 million who watched Mr. Fox in the early months of the previous season. Mr. Fox's audience grew after the announcement that he was leaving last May.</p>
        <p>In recent months ''Spin City,'' on Wednesday night at 9:30, has had strong competition from the sexually provocative Fox reality show ''Temptation Island'' and NBC's increasingly popular ''West Wing.'' (Martin Sheen, who plays President Josiah Bartlet on ''The West Wing,'' is Charlie Sheen's father.) But the audience for ''Spin City'' is nonetheless higher among television's most prized demographic group: teenagers and young adults. The audience for ''Spin City'' has increased 13 percent among teenagers since Mr. Fox's final season and 7 percent among men 18 to 34.</p>
        <p>Why has ''Spin City'' unexpectedly prospered? Audiences may be responding to the series's new sexiness. In the episode introducing Mr. Sheen as a new deputy mayor, he was seen in bed with a female flight attendant. In various episodes his character has  drunk too much, gambled and had an eye for women that would have been unthinkable for Mr. Fox, whose image as the boy next door prevailed even when he tried to be lecherous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheen has no such problem. As Charlie Crawford, he plays a funny and slightly dissolute fellow who is mentioned far more often in gossip columns than in news articles and is now trying to rehabilitate himself. (It is no secret that Mr. Sheen is more or less playing himself.) And his work with Heather Locklear, whom the show's producers consider both a classic blond beauty and a gifted comedian, playing Caitlin Moore, City Hall's director of special projects, adds a new sexual dynamic.</p>
        <p>''I'm just glad people are responding,'' Mr. Sheen said when asked why the series has stirred audiences. ''I can't comment on what they're responding to.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Locklear said she was also unable to explain the ratings. ''Maybe there's more awareness of the show,'' she said. ''Michael and Charlie are such completely different people. It's definitely more of an ensemble show. Is it sexier? I think so, because of what Charlie brings to it.''</p>
        <p>Which actor did Ms. Locklear prefer working with? ''I don't feel comfortable answering that,'' she said. ''It's like comparing boyfriends.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsh gave several reasons for the upsurge in the ''Spin City'' ratings, including its time slot. In the first half of Mr. Fox's final season the show was on Tuesday nights at 8, facing tough competition from ''Just Shoot Me'' and ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''</p>
        <p>And then there is Mr. Sheen. ''He was a movie star who came to television, he had a bad-boy image, and I'm sure he had a certain mystique,'' Mr. Marsh said. ''I'm sure young people followed his antics and found him more intriguing than Michael J. Fox, who is happily married and a family man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheen was cast almost by accident. Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the owners of DreamWorks SKG, the show's production company, said that only he and Gary David Goldberg, a creator of the show, knew of Mr. Fox's increasing difficulties with Parkinson's, a degenerative disease that causes tremors and muscle rigidity. ''All sorts of adjustments were made in order to support Michael, but it was clearly getting harder and harder for him to do the show without talking about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Early last year Mr. Fox, also an executive producer of ''Spin City,'' told Mr. Katzenberg, Mr. Goldberg and Dan McDermott, the head of television for DreamWorks, that he was unable to continue in the cast. But he announced his decision only after ''Spin City'' had filmed enough episodes to make it lucrative in syndication. ''We had gotten 110 or so episodes out of it,'' Mr. Katzenberg said. ''It was the magic number to have a library asset. It was very important that everybody who had invested four years in the show have that asset. The decision to continue after Michael left wasn't financially driven; it wasn't the imperative.''</p>
        <p>Soon after Mr. Fox's decision, Mr. Goldberg said, he began asking why the show had to fade, especially with such a strong ensemble cast: Barry Bostwick as Randall Winston, New York's slightly dim mayor, as well as Alan Ruck, Richard Kind, Michael Boatman and Lana Parrilla as various city officials. Then Mr. Goldberg's agent, Jeremy Zimmer, a partner at the United Talent Agency, called to say that he had just seen Charlie Sheen on the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' and found him both funny and self-deprecating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldberg met with Mr. Sheen, with whom he had worked on a short-lived 1999 police series, ''Sugar Hill,'' and mentioned him to Mr. Katzenberg and Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment. They agreed that he would be an unusual choice to replace Mr. Fox and that the show could mirror some of Mr. Sheen's image.</p>
        <p>''Charlie said, 'Look, Gary, I've been the biggest joke in Hollywood for 10 years,' '' Mr. Goldberg recalled. '' 'If I can't laugh at myself, no one else will.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheen said that Mr. Fox was very supportive. ''He said, 'Enjoy it, embrace it,' '' Mr. Sheen said. ''He also said, 'If you need any tips or shortcuts, call.' After a few shows Michael called back, and said, 'Well, I guess I won't be getting any phone calls.' He said that I don't need any tips at all. That was one of the nicest calls I've ever gotten.''</p>
