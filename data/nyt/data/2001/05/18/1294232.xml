        <p>Everything's Up to Date</p>
        <p>It's been anticipated, rebuffed and widely rumored to be resurfacing.  It's been cast, recast and then rescinded. It's an American classic rethought by a British director and the world's hottest choreographer. And now, after a series of starts and stops, Trevor Nunn's revival of ''Oklahoma!'' is finally, officially and really coming to Broadway. (They promise.)</p>
        <p>After previous run-ins with Actors' Equity and conflicts in the schedules of its all-star creative team, the Royal National Theater production is to open on Broadway on March 21. As expected, ''Oklahoma!'' will play the Gershwin Theater.</p>
        <p>The show has been talked about as a potential Broadway blockbuster since it was first mounted in July 1998. Raves followed, but a transfer of the British production was blocked by Equity, the American actors' union. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, and Mr. Nunn were miffed, but last spring they again began making plans for a Broadway run, this time with an American cast.</p>
        <p>Auditions were held, but production plans were delayed again in July after Mr. Nunn and Susan Stroman, the choreographer, realized they would not have time to rehearse a new cast.</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Mackintosh says the stars have aligned long enough to allow the production to come together.</p>
        <p>If he's right, Ms. Stroman may well set a new Broadway milestone with five (count 'em, five) shows on Broadway concurrently: ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Contact,'' ''The Music Man,'' ''The Producers'' and ''Thou Shalt Not,'' a collaboration with Harry Connick Jr., to open in the fall.</p>
        <p>Only one member of the American cast is confirmed; Patrick Wilson (''The Full Monty'') will play Curly. Other casting should be completed by late September.</p>
        <p>Whoever they are, the actors should have plenty of room to swing a rope. The Gershwin is Broadway's largest theater, with 1,933 seats. That size has proved daunting to many productions, including a string of money losers. Even ''Riverdance'' couldn't turn a profit at the Gershwin; it will close on Aug. 26 after several months of flagging sales. It will have recouped about $4 million of its $5.5 million investment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mackintosh, however, said he was confident that the Gershwin was perfect for Mr. Nunn's ''Oklahoma!,'' which places the orchestra behind the actors, rather than in a pit. (The musicians are visible only during the overture and curtain call.) The stage will also extend into the audience, eliminating about 200 seats. ''You need a theater with huge stage depth,'' he said. ''And the Gershwin is one of the few to have it.''</p>
        <p>Shepard Watch</p>
        <p>It was the West Coast's biggest theatrical event of 2000, a world premiere by America's only matinee idol-cum-playwright. Now that play, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' by Sam Shepard, is coming to New York, albeit without its original cast, which included Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson.</p>
        <p>The play, which had scalpers swarming the Magic Theater in San Francisco in November, will be presented by the Signature Theater Company on West 42nd Street. No casting has been announced for the New York production, which is to open on Sept. 16. It will be directed by Joseph Chaikin, a longtime Shepard collaborator.</p>
        <p>Like many of Mr. Shepard's plays (''True West,'' ''Fool for Love''), ''Henry Moss'' is set in the American West and revolves around the tempestuous relationships of brothers, family members, men and women, and any appliances that happen to get in the way.</p>
        <p>Speaking from his ranch in Wisconsin, Mr. Shepard said he was sort of glad that the New York production wouldn't be quite so starry. ''There was all this hoopla around the cast,'' he said. ''So I thought, 'Let's try this the opposite way.' '' He said he would not be at rehearsals, leaving them to Mr. Chaikin. ''I don't want to look at the damn thing,'' he said, with a laugh. ''It's over and done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shepard is just one of three high-profile playwrights whom the Signature, which usually focuses on one writer a year, has on deck for 2001-2. After him comes Edward Albee, who will present the world premiere of an experimental work, ''I Think Back Now on André Gide,'' in the winter slot. The spring slot will be amiably filled by John Guare, who is also presenting a world premiere, ''A Few Stout Individuals.'' The play, also still in process, is the tale of an  elderly, wealthy, infirm man and his attempt to write his memoirs. It is, Mr. Guare assures us, not autobiographical.</p>
        <p>Win-Win Situations</p>
        <p>For awards aficionados, it's party time. During the next three days, you'll see the unveiling of the Astaires (today), the Drama Desks (Sunday) and three on Monday: the Obies, the Dramatists Guild awards, and the brand new National Broadway Theater Awards.</p>
        <p>Each set of awards has its own quirky appeal. The Astaires, for example, which celebrate dancing on Broadway, begin at noon today with a cocktail reception. (That's how they get those happy feet.) The usually irreverent Obies, founded by the usually irreverent Village Voice, have no nominees, no time limit for speeches and lots of impromptu excitement. (One winner in 1995 vomited en route to the podium.)</p>
        <p>Then there are the National Broadway Awards, which honor touring productions and which are voted on by theatergoers, not those snobby artistic types. Some Broadway insiders  have nicknamed them the Jedi, (pronounced as in ''Star Wars'') in honor of its founder, Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and Producers. The awards, to be given at the Supper Club, are in their first year, and a few winners have already been announced (drumroll, please): ''Ragtime'' will win for best touring musical and ''Dame Edna'' for best play.</p>
        <p>Along the Way</p>
        <p>*''Saint Lucy's Eyes,'' starring Ruby Dee, will transfer to the Cherry Lane Theater on July 12.</p>
        <p>*''Urinetown'' is going to Broadway. The onetime Fringe Festival hit (small theaters, smaller audiences) will take up residence at Henry Miller's Theater on West 43rd Street in late July.</p>
