        <p>In the late 1950's, when it was new, Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'' was hailed within the contemporary music avant-garde as a breakthrough work of genius from a composer still in his 20's and decried by most mainstream concertgoers (few of whom had actually heard it) as just another offputting exercise in serialism. But even the work's champions admitted that the music was terribly difficult to perform.</p>
        <p>A lot has changed since then. Recently, through recommendations from teachers and composers, Carnegie Hall had no difficulty recruiting a roster of crack young musicians for an eight-day workshop to prepare a performance of ''Le Marteau'' under the guidance of Mr. Boulez and four members of Ensemble Intercontemporain, his new-music group in Paris. The participants worked on the score in open rehearsals attended by some 70 auditors.</p>

        <p>In the late 1950's, when it was new, Pierre Boulez's ''Marteau Sans Maître'' was hailed within the contemporary music avant-garde as a breakthrough work of genius from a composer still in his 20's and decried by most mainstream concertgoers (few of whom had actually heard it) as just another offputting exercise in serialism. But even the work's champions admitted that the music was terribly difficult to perform.</p>
        <p>A lot has changed since then. Recently, through recommendations from teachers and composers, Carnegie Hall had no difficulty recruiting a roster of crack young musicians for an eight-day workshop to prepare a performance of ''Le Marteau'' under the guidance of Mr. Boulez and four members of Ensemble Intercontemporain, his new-music group in Paris. The participants worked on the score in open rehearsals attended by some 70 auditors.</p>
        <p>The resulting public performance, conducted by Mr. Boulez at Weill Recital Hall on Monday night, boosted his contention, expressed in a pre-concert interview, that this challenging score was more accessible to able musicians today than to those of his youth.</p>
        <p>What has also changed over the last 40 years is the public perception of the piece. Hearing ''Le Marteau'' on Monday, it was hard to imagine why this alluring work was ever treated like some dogmatic serialist tract.</p>
        <p>Written in homage to Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' ''Le Marteau Sans Maître'' (''The Hammer Without a Master'') is a setting in nine movements of three obscure Surrealistic poems by René Char, scored with astounding imagination for mezzo-soprano and six wildly diverse instruments: flute (here, Andrée Martin), xylorimba (Svetoslav Stoyanov), vibraphone (Javier Diaz), percussion (Morris Palter), guitar (Aliéksey Vianna) and viola (Edmundo Ramírez).</p>
        <p>Mr. Boulez may be the most sumptuous French colorist since Debussy, and the instrumental hues he extracts from the unconventional ensemble are wondrously varied, both when the textures are thick with hypercharged, zigzagging counterpoint, or thinned to diaphanous solos for flute or guitar.</p>
        <p>The mezzo-soprano Julia Bentley brought rich sound, deep expressivity and an uncanny sense of pitch to the work's restless vocal lines, alive with sudden skips and spiky rhythms one moment, hushed and Impressionistic the next. It was touching to see Mr. Boulez, relaxed and courtly at 76, drawing such vibrant and incisive playing from these earnest and gifted young musicians. The work's 40 minutes went by in no time.</p>
        <p>The program began with Mr. Boulez's ''Anthèmes I'' (1991), a seven-minute work for solo violin, played by the brilliant young Timothy Fain, and the 10-minute Piano Sonata No. 1 (1946), astonishingly compact and steely music, played by a superb pianist, Shai Wosner.</p>
