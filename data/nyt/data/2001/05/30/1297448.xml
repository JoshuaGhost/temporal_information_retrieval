        <p>For the first  time, New Yorkers today were able</p>
        <p>with a little patience and luck -- to watch the Legislature live from their homes and offices, as the State Senate began broadcasting its meetings on its Web site.</p>
        <p>That step gave the Senate bragging rights over the Assembly, whose leaders have promised live television coverage before this year's legislative session ends this summer. After years of saying they favored video coverage but doing little to make it happen, the two houses have raced this year to top each other, each claiming its approach is superior.</p>

        <p>For the first  time, New Yorkers today were able</p>
        <p>with a little patience and luck -- to watch the Legislature live from their homes and offices, as the State Senate began broadcasting its meetings on its Web site.</p>
        <p>That step gave the Senate bragging rights over the Assembly, whose leaders have promised live television coverage before this year's legislative session ends this summer. After years of saying they favored video coverage but doing little to make it happen, the two houses have raced this year to top each other, each claiming its approach is superior.</p>
        <p>''You are part of history here in New York State,'' the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, declared today after the Webcast began (at www.senate.state.ny.us).</p>
        <p>For now, it is just gavel-to-gavel coverage, with the cameras trained at all times on whoever is speaking, with no moderator. But getting the jerky video feed proved a challenge for those who tried, with some unable to gain access, and others finding that after a few minutes of watching, they lost the connection. John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate's Republican majority, said he had not heard of such problems, and attributed them to ''first-day glitches.''</p>
        <p>Good-government groups that have clamored for live coverage of the Legislature said they preferred cable television to Internet access, saying that it would reach more people and would have better picture quality, and that viewers would be more likely to stumble upon it.</p>
        <p>But the Assembly, which has said it would make its television feed available to anyone who wants it, has not figured out who will take it. Cable television industry officials have been reluctant to dedicate a channel to the Legislature, as they have with the United States Congress on C-Span.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, state officials said the cable industry has agreed to provide them with three hours of time to fill any way they like on Sunday mornings -- an hour each for Gov. George E. Pataki, the Senate and the Assembly. That effort began Sunday. Each house reported that it had filled its hour, but the governor's office said he did not, and it was not clear how many cable operators carried the programs.</p>
        <p>The governor, the Senate and the Assembly have indicated that the their hours would be filled with a combination of clips from legislative sessions, hearings, news conferences, announcements and interviews with the politicians conducted just for the programs. In the Legislature, the content would be controlled by the majority party, the Republicans in the Senate and the Democrats in the Assembly.</p>
