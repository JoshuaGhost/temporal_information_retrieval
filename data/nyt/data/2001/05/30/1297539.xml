        <p>Steve Trachsel, who accepted a demotion to Class AAA Norfolk after starting the season 1-6 for the Mets, threw a seven-inning no-hitter last night in the host Tides' 3-0 victory over Ottawa, the first game of a doubleheader. In the minors, each game in a doubleheader is seven innings. Trachsel struck out five and walked two, and kept the game ball despite the setting.</p>
        <p>''I don't care what level you're at, it's still something a lot of guys haven't done,'' said Trachsel, who threw a no-hitter 10 years ago in the minors.</p>

        <p>Trachsel, on a 19-day minor league assignment, will make one more start before returning to the Mets. General Manager Steve Phillips said last night's outing would not hasten Trachsel's recall.</p>
        <p>''I definitely keep an eye on what's going on up there,'' said Trachsel, who allowed three earned runs in six innings in his first Norfolk start. ''It's part of what's hard being down here -- my head and my heart are still up there.''</p>
