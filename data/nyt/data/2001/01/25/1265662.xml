        <p>Lucent Technologies, one of the world's biggest makers of communications equipment, announced a broad reorganization that includes eliminating 10,000 jobs, about 9.4 percent of its workers. Fifteen hundred of those are to be in New Jersey, where the company employs 17,000 people. Throughout Lucent, many cuts will come in overlapping sales and marketing groups.</p>
        <p>The plan, which includes a charge of at least $1.2 billion, is meant to help the company climb back to the top of the digital economy after a series of damaging missteps.</p>

        <p>For a few years after Lucent was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1996, its stock, profits and profile soared as it expanded overseas and began providing gear for the Internet and data networks. But it returned to earth last year, warning four times that it would not meet its financial targets.</p>
