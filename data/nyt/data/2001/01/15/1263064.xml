        <p>It has been a head-spinning couple of days in Hong Kong, where the sudden resignation of a top official and a politically sensitive meeting of the Falun Gong sect sent deeply contradictory messages about the former British colony's autonomy within China.</p>
        <p>About 1,200 members of Falun Gong gathered in a government-owned concert hall today to share experiences and to protest China's  crackdown on their spirital movement. Despite fierce opposition from pro-Beijing forces here, the meeting proceeded without interference.</p>
        <p>While Falun Gong leaders thanked the authorities for allowing them to meet here, they protested that 11 of their members had been detained at the airport. ''We are starting to worry that Hong Kong is no longer safeguarding the rule of law,'' said Kan Hung-cheung, a spokesman for the group.</p>
        <p>Such fears are percolating elsewhere after the abrupt resignation of the territory's No. 2 official, Anson Chan, on Friday. Mrs. Chan, the director of the Hong Kong Civil Service and a forceful advocate of the city's independence, insisted that she was leaving for personal reasons. But her departure comes four months after she was chided by the Chinese leaders for not adequately supporting the Beijing-appointed chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa.</p>
        <p>The obvious question is whether Mrs. Chan's departure is related to the meeting today. Some government officials cast doubt on that, saying Mrs. Chan did not approve the decision to rent the hall to Falun Gong. Yet the officials said the decision had drawn strong criticism from Beijing.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's generally hands-off treatment of Falun Gong has reinforced its reputation as a city with a greater appreciation of civil liberties than mainland China. ''This decision tells people 'one country, two systems' still exists in Hong Kong,'' said Martin Lee, a pro-democracy leader, referring to the formula under which the territory is to retain some autonomy for 50 years.</p>
        <p>But the events of the last two days paint a murkier picture. The immigration department confirmed that it refused entry to 13 people who said they were members of Falun Gong, though it said it did so because they had improper travel documents.</p>
        <p>And Hong Kong drew other lines in the sand. The sect was allowed to display a portrait of its spiritual leader, Li Hongzhi, but it was asked not to show inside the building photographs of reported attacks on its members by the police in China. ''In a society that isn't feeling the pressure of Jiang Zemin and his followers, we wouldn't be subject to these kinds of restrictions,'' Mr. Kan said.</p>
