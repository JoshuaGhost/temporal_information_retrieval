        <p>WHEN you share Rudolph W. Giuliani's love of the Yankees but, sadly, not his passion for opera, you must turn to your betters to fill in the gaps. So opera-savvy colleagues were beseeched for insights into ''Falstaff,'' Giuseppe Verdi's last work, which the mayor invoked on Monday night while giving his final speech on the state of the city.</p>
        <p>He felt like Verdi, Mr. Giuliani said near the end of a marathon speech filled with so many themes that some in the audience began wondering if the kitchen sink was about to get tossed in, too.</p>
        <p>It wasn't that he felt 80 years old, the Italian composer's age when ''Falstaff'' was first performed in 1893. No, he meant instead the nature of a final production. Verdi, the mayor said, ''put in thousands of themes and, like, all these things that he had in his head that he didn't get to develop in other areas, he stuck it all in 'Falstaff.' ''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it wasn't Mr. Giuliani's intention, but he made ''Falstaff'' sound almost like a dumping ground for half-finished ideas. That, the opera-wise brain trust advises, isn't quite on the money. But if the mayor meant simply that this opera was a patchwork of moods and motifs nurtured over a career, then, it seems, he got it dead right.</p>
        <p>One authoritative source, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, says this about ''Falstaff'':</p>
        <p>''The listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms, orchestral textures, melodic motifs and harmonic devices. Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other, shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession.''</p>
        <p>That's exactly what the Monday night speech felt like. O.K., it wasn't Verdi. But it was a cascade of suggestions and demands and reflections, one bumping into the other as they vied for the audience's attention.</p>
        <p>If one didn't know better, he might have thought Mr. Giuliani was taking speech lessons from Fidel Castro. He slogged on for nearly two hours, and would have kept on going had he not left out a few points. Never fear, however. The mayor got around to them at length yesterday, including his plan to wrest control of the city's two airports from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Falstaff'' is not a bad metaphor for a mayoralty that has had so many operatic moments, especially in the last year. The only problem is that it is hard sometimes to follow the score.</p>
        <p>First, you have the notoriously slash-and-burn mayor who, receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer and breaking up with his wife, turns into a soft-spoken, seemingly vulnerable puppy hugger. Suddenly, he is acknowledging that he must reach out to New Yorkers, namely blacks and Hispanics, whom he made to feel unwelcome at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Then, almost without warning, the name-calling angry man is back. Reach out to black elected officials? No way. ''What happens when you engage in the dialogue is you compromise,'' Mr. Giuliani said as 2000 drew to a close.</p>
        <p>Jump cut now to Monday night. There's the gentler mayor again, offering his hand to politicians he has reviled and talking about how governing New York is an ensemble effort (just like ''Falstaff,'' he might well have added). As a grace note, he proposed naming a new park along the East River for the late Mayor John V. Lindsay, not a predecessor likely to enter Mr. Giuliani's pantheon of immortals.</p>
        <p>YOU'VE got to work to keep up with these ever-changing mayoral arias. One thing is certain, though: in this opera, the fat lady is a long way from singing.</p>
        <p>To the surprise of absolutely no one, Mr. Giuliani is making it clear he will be a force to reckon with throughout his final year at City Hall. The question is how closely his lead will be followed by the men who would succeed him: a lot or a whole lot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, famous for taking revenge when crossed, has kept people in line by instilling terror in all but his sternest critics. Will that wall of fear hold or start to crumble? You could see a few cracks develop last week when the Port Authority's executive director, Robert E. Boyle, dismissed the latest round of attacks on his agency by the mayor as ''rantings.''</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, it is bound to be interesting, maybe even fun. Bear in mind what Falstaff says at the end of Verdi's opera:</p>
        <p>''Everything in the world is a jest. Man is born a jester. We must laugh at each other. But remember, the man who laughs best is the man who laughs last.''</p>
        <p>Ah, but who will that man be?</p>
