        <p>THE Winter Vegetarian'' (HarperPerennial, 2000, $16) by Darra Goldstein could easily be tossed aside, dismissed for the narrowness of its scope. You need a cookbook on winter vegetarian food as much as you need a cookbook devoted to polenta, right?</p>
        <p>Well, possibly, except that winter, for seasonal purists, really is a challenging period to get through. And its bounty is quite different from what is available the rest of the year: starchy, heavy root vegetables, pungent aromatics like garlic and onions and a few greens that start out with the texture of vinyl. Almost nothing glistens.</p>

        <p>THE Winter Vegetarian'' (HarperPerennial, 2000, $16) by Darra Goldstein could easily be tossed aside, dismissed for the narrowness of its scope. You need a cookbook on winter vegetarian food as much as you need a cookbook devoted to polenta, right?</p>
        <p>Well, possibly, except that winter, for seasonal purists, really is a challenging period to get through. And its bounty is quite different from what is available the rest of the year: starchy, heavy root vegetables, pungent aromatics like garlic and onions and a few greens that start out with the texture of vinyl. Almost nothing glistens.</p>
        <p>As people pay more attention to seasonal cooking, the need for such a cookbook could be justified. But Ms. Goldstein ignores this in favor of a very personal and quite convincing argument about the rewards of cooking in winter. It is not the dead season but one that's marked with sensual pleasures, not the least of which is a home dense with aromas of cooking.</p>
        <p>She marches forth with a historical overview of the larder, winter's guarded treasure, then gets right to recipes. Aside from a few from Asia and the Mediterranean, which feel like dangling participles in otherwise tight, crisp prose, most of them come from northern parts, including Russia and Scandinavia.</p>
        <p>Two unusual recipes called for spirits. In one, rutabaga is pureed with butter and Scotch. The Scotch had a way of punctuating the flavor and alleviating the weight of the starch, though it's the kind of dish that needs to paired carefully -- pork or lamb would work, but not chicken or fish. In another, onions and tomatoes were simmered with brandy. The mixture cooked down to a sweet, mellow compote.</p>
        <p>A porridge with tapioca, buttermilk and pears was tangy and sweet; a buckwheat honey cake was austere in its sweetness. An almond soup with saffron and garlic, though, needed work. Straining it would have helped the texture. A little chicken stock could have added body without too much weight. But then it would be wintry and not vegetarian.</p>
        <p>BRANDIED ONIONS  Time: 50 minutes</p>
        <p>2 pounds yellow onions, peeled, sliced and separated into rings  2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil  1 28-ounce can tomatoes, drained and chopped</p>
        <p>1/4 cup brandy  1 scant teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>3/4 teaspoon black pepper.</p>
        <p>In a large skillet over medium low heat, cook onions in butter until golden, about 15 minutes, stirring often. Stir in  1/4 cup water,  tomatoes, brandy, salt and pepper, and simmer 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
