      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Having completed the cabinet, the  Bush administration got around today to the appointment that Washington's diplomatic and social communities have really been waiting for:</p>
        <p>Catherine S. Fenton was picked by Laura Bush as the White House social secretary.</p>
        <p>And she was among three top appointments to Mrs. Bush's staff announced today. Andrea Ball, who is now Mrs. Bush's chief of staff in Texas, will take that position in Washington. And Noelia Rodriguez, a deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will become Mrs. Bush's press secretary.</p>
        <p>Of the three, Ms. Fenton has the longest Washington track record.</p>
        <p>''She knows how to do a state dinner,'' said Ann Stock, who was social secretary for almost five years in the Clinton administration. ''It's not new to her.''</p>
        <p>It is not new because Ms. Fenton served in the White House as deputy social secretary for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fenton will have a lot to say about who gets invited to dinner at the White House, which is a matter of importance to members of the administration and Congress, the diplomatic corps, Washington society and, Ms. Stock said, ordinary Americans.</p>
        <p>''Every single person in the world would love to have an invitation to the White House,'' said Ms. Stock, who is now vice president for institutional affairs at the Kennedy Center. ''This is not about Bill Clinton or George Bush. It is about the White House.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fenton agreed.</p>
        <p>''An invitation to the White House is unique and stays with them forever,'' she said. ''It does rise above politics. I will aspire to maintain that uniqueness and make everyone feel as special as the invitation itself.''</p>
        <p>It is through her entertaining that a first lady can set the tone for an administration, and the social secretary pushes many of the levers. Jacqueline Kennedy brought elegance and classical music to the White House, and Mrs. Reagan reinstituted some of the glamour. Hillary Rodham Clinton brought in a Hollywood contingent and a wide cross-section of American society.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fenton also has an odd connection to the Clinton White House. After Bill Clinton became president, some of his appointees improperly gathered F.B.I. background files on Reagan and Bush officials. Among the several hundred people whose records were sought, The Washington Times reported in 1996, was Ms. Fenton.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fenton said she had no idea why anyone in the White House would have wanted to see her file. ''I guess I was early-on in the alphabet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fenton, whose 47th birthday is Tuesday, is a 1976 graduate of the University of Vermont and lives in Skillman, N.J., with her husband, Timothy, and their 6-year-old son, Nicholas.</p>
        <p>After working in the White House, Ms. Fenton was social secretary to the Japanese ambassador here from 1992 to 1995.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ball, the chief of staff to Mrs. Bush in her role as first lady of Texas, held a similar position during the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rodriguez was the chief executive officer of the host committee for the Democratic convention in Los Angeles. She served in the administration of Mayor Richard J. Riordan for four years, first as press secretary and then as deputy mayor.</p>
        <p>Although Lynne Cheney, the wife of Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, has yet to announce her staff, a prominent Republican involved in the transition said that she had already chosen that team and that three of the primary women on it were returning to work after time away as stay-at-home mothers.</p>
        <p>Deborah Dunn, who ran the White House visitors' office during the first Bush administration, will be Mrs. Cheney's chief of staff, the official said, adding that Laura Farish-Chadwick would be Mrs. Cheney's personal assistant and Lee Berman would be social secretary.</p>
