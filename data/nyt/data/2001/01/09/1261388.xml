        <p>A Roto-Rooter operator collapses and dies while working on a drain. Assumption: a heart attack. A seemingly healthy baby dies in his sleep. Assumption: sudden infant death syndrome. An elderly Kentucky woman known from C.T. scans to have malignant-looking lesions in her brain dies before undergoing exploratory surgery. Assumption: metastatic cancer. A 43-year-old Connecticut man with shortness of breath, a cough, positive skin test for tuberculosis and multiple clots in his lungs dies before a biopsy can be performed. Assumption: tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>But when autopsies were performed on these people, quite different stories emerged. The Roto-Rooter operator was electrocuted, a finding that may have saved the lives of others using the faulty equipment and that resulted in double-indemnity insurance for his survivors.</p>
        <p>The baby succumbed to previously undiagnosed meningitis, prompting protective vaccinations of other children in the family and the neighborhood. The woman turned out not to have cancer at all but rather abscesses in her brain resulting from an advanced case of periodontal disease. But the Connecticut man did have cancer that had spread from his pancreas.</p>
        <p>Forensic pathologists, the physicians who perform autopsies, are quick to relate numerous tales of mistaken diagnoses, missed diseases and wrong assumptions, any of which can, if undetected, undermine the quality of future medical care and leave survivors racked with guilt, deprived of deserved compensation or vulnerable to preventable diseases.</p>
        <p>Yet the rate of autopsies in the nation's hospitals has been declining for decades. In many institutions, the rate is so low -- no more than 5 percent to 10 percent of all deaths -- that it is no longer possible for the living to learn from the dead, as the value of autopsies is described. In many institutions, fewer than 3 percent of deaths prompt an autopsy, and the autopsy rate is even lower in nursing homes, where at most 1 percent of deaths result in autopsy. Many new hospitals do not even have autopsy rooms.</p>
        <p>When an out-of-hospital death occurs suddenly, unexpectedly or results from unusual or violent circumstances, in most states it is up to the county coroner or medical examiner to decide whether an autopsy is warranted, although some states mandate that autopsies be done in certain situations.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gregory Davis, a forensic pathologist at the University of Kentucky, says about half of unusual or suspicious deaths turn out to be due to natural causes. That information can provide valuable medical information as well as emotional relief for survivors.</p>
        <p>Why the Decline</p>
        <p>Financial pressures have prompted many hospitals, which traditionally have covered the cost of autopsies as an operating expense, to discourage or abandon them entirely. As Dr. Davis put it, ''In a lot of modern hospitals, doctors are told indirectly that doing fewer autopsies means more money is available for something else.''</p>
        <p>When survivors request an autopsy, some hospitals now charge the family, which may think twice when told that the minimum cost is $2,500.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the advent of advanced diagnostic tools like C.T. scans, M.R.I.'s and PET scans. That technology sometimes causes people to assume falsely that nothing more of value can be learned from an autopsy. But, as the Kentucky woman's case demonstrated, no test can replace the accuracy of ''seeing for oneself,'' the literal meaning of the Greek-derived word autopsy.</p>
        <p>Time pressures also are a factor. Dr. Davis says hospital-based pathologists today are dealing with a workload at least 50 percent greater than that of two decades ago. A proper autopsy takes a minimum of two hours, which may not seem justifiable when families of living patients are waiting impatiently for biopsy results.</p>
        <p>Some doctors may be reluctant to request an autopsy for fear that the findings may result in a lawsuit. But Dr. Davis said: ''Ninety-five percent of the time, a good autopsy dispels any notion of malpractice suspected by the family. In 15 years, I've seen many more lawsuits thrown out because of autopsy findings than won.''</p>
        <p>Survivors may be reluctant to request an autopsy because of mistaken beliefs about what is involved. An autopsy does not distort the body in any way apparent to mourners viewing an open coffin. An autopsy cannot increase the suffering of someone who is dead. And an autopsy does not interfere with embalming and need not delay a funeral by more than a few hours.</p>
        <p>Value of Autopsies</p>
        <p>At the societal level, accurate data on the causes of death are critical for planning a health care system responsive to the needs of the people. Without knowing why people die, it is not possible to provide the facilities needed to care for the living.</p>
        <p>Through autopsies, Legionnaire's disease and AIDS were discovered, and the ''cafe coronary'' was revealed to be a choking death that could be averted by the Heimlich maneuver. Autopsies of crash victims have led to improved safety standards in cars and planes. Autopsies have also alerted officials to growing threats of infection or drug addiction. And sometimes car ''accidents'' are discovered in autopsies to have been suicides or even homicides.</p>
        <p>''A good autopsy uncovers the true disease process,'' Dr. Davis said. ''In 20 to 40 percent of cases, the autopsy finds a diagnostic discrepancy between the medical diagnosis and the actual disease'' that may help improve the care of future patients.</p>
        <p>For example, in a Connecticut study of 272 randomly selected autopsies and their corresponding death certificates, Dr. William H. Hartmann, executive vice president of the American Board of Pathologist, said, ''In 29 percent of the deaths, a major disagreement on the underlying cause of death led to a reclassification of the death in a different major disease category.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''An additional 26 percent of deaths were attributed to a different specific disease. And of those, 14 percent would in all probability have led to a change in clinical management that might have resulted in cure or prolonged survival.''</p>
        <p>For the survivors, knowing the real cause of death may help them avert a similar fate. For example, a man who dies in an automobile accident may have suffered a heart attack before losing control of the car. This can alert his siblings and offspring to an increased risk of heart disease and prompt them to pursue heart-healthy living habits. Or the autopsy may reveal a hereditary condition that may influence family decisions about future childbearing.</p>
        <p>If malpractice is a possibility in the death, the autopsy can provide the facts the family needs to win a lawsuit or negotiate a settlement. Or the findings may increase an insurance award, as in the case of the Roto-Rooter worker.</p>
        <p>In other cases, autopsy findings can assuage the guilt family members and friends may harbor. For example, when a man dies while shoveling snow, his spouse may berate herself for not hiring someone to clean the walk, until the autopsy reveals an advanced heart condition that could have caused his death at any time.</p>
