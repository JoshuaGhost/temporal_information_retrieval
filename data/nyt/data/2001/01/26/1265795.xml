        <p>''Voyages'' was shown as part of last year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from A. O. Scott's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 27. The film -- in French, Hebrew and Russian, with English subtitles -- opens today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Like most films that deal with the Holocaust, Emmanuel Finkiel's ''Voyages'' honors the imperative to remember. It bears little resemblance to films like ''Schindler's List'' or ''Life Is Beautiful,'' which try to reconstruct the horror of Nazism to contain it within the soothing parameters of conventional narrative. Nor does it undertake the painstaking documentation of Claude Lanzmann's ''Shoah'' or ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' by Marcel Ophuls.</p>

        <p>''Voyages'' was shown as part of last year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from A. O. Scott's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 27. The film -- in French, Hebrew and Russian, with English subtitles -- opens today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Like most films that deal with the Holocaust, Emmanuel Finkiel's ''Voyages'' honors the imperative to remember. It bears little resemblance to films like ''Schindler's List'' or ''Life Is Beautiful,'' which try to reconstruct the horror of Nazism to contain it within the soothing parameters of conventional narrative. Nor does it undertake the painstaking documentation of Claude Lanzmann's ''Shoah'' or ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' by Marcel Ophuls.</p>
        <p>Rather, ''Voyages'' evokes the terrors of the past by showing them to be out of reach. Time's power to heal -- or at least to dull -- even the most hideous wounds may be the greatest tragedy of all.</p>
        <p>''Voyages'' is set in the secure, ordinary world of the present. Its three linked stories take place in clean, friendly, post-Communist Poland, in the middle-class neighborhoods of Paris, and in the bright bustle of Tel Aviv. Moving slowly and confusedly through these hectic landscapes, which seem perfectly indifferent to history, is a collection of elderly Jews trying to find a way to reconcile the blandness of the modern world with what they know of its recent past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finkiel, who worked as an assistant director on Krzystof Kieslowski's ''Three Colors'' trilogy, shares with his ex-boss a knack for infusing the banalities of contemporary Europe with an air of strangeness and uncertainty. He is also a slow and subtle storyteller, allowing narrative information to seep in through the edges of his long takes.</p>
        <p>At first you're not sure that what you're seeing has any narrative momentum at all. A group of French survivors is taking a bus tour of Poland, stopping at a Jewish cemetery and driving past the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto fighters before making a pilgrimage to Auschwitz. In the middle of nowhere the bus breaks down and, though none mention it, it seems like a hideous cosmic joke. A bus transporting Jews to a death camp will not reach its destination. Is this merciful or cruel?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we witness the emotional unraveling of a woman named Rivka Adler (Shulamit Adar). Just as her anger and despair seem to be heading for a catharsis, her story vanishes into another one that seems to have blossomed from an incidental conversation on the bus. A widow living in Paris (Liliane Rovere) receives a letter from a man in Lithuania saying he is her father, whom she always assumed had died in the camps. After more than 50 years she takes him in, but the emotional and genealogical truth of their relationship has been obscured by time and distance.</p>
        <p>The third panel in Mr. Finkiel's triptych -- the simplest and strangest of his fragmentary tales -- turns out to be the key to the other two. It follows Vera, a round-faced, tireless émigrée from Russia, as she traverses Israel in search of a distant cousin. To her bemusement no one in the Jewish homeland speaks a word of Yiddish, and she looks strangely out of place surrounded by palm trees and good-looking young soldiers. What can she do but keep moving until she finds someplace to sit and rest?</p>
        <p>Given its subject, ''Voyages'' is a film of remarkable subtlety and restraint. Mr. Finkiel's characters carry themselves with heartbreaking dignity. The history of the Jews in postwar and post-cold-war Europe is carved into their faces, but it's an alphabet nobody knows how to read. This movie operates in the limbo between memory and oblivion that we recognize as daily life. It bears courageous and stringent witness to the impossibility of bearing witness.</p>
