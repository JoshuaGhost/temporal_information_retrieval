        <p>When Elie Wiesel, a voice of humanity, peace and conscience, reluctantly concludes (Op-Ed, Jan. 24) that the Arabs want not a smaller Israel, but no Israel, it is time for the United States government to stop pressuring Israel into what would be a premature settlement leading only to another war. A new attitude on the part of the United States would be noticed by the Arab countries.</p>

        <p>Mr. Wiesel was unable to stop President Ronald Reagan from visiting the German military cemetery at Bitburg in 1985, but perhaps the new president knows better to whom to listen.</p>
