        <p>Senator Orrin Hatch called on the recording industry yesterday to catch up with consumer demand for online music, warning that he intended to ''do what I can'' to see that the major record labels provided for fair, nondiscriminatory licensing of music. Senator Hatch, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made his remarks at the opening of a conference sponsored by the Coalition for the Future of Music. About 400 recording artists, technologists, record executives and lawyers gathered at Georgetown University for the two-day event to discuss how the Internet is affecting the creation and dissemination of music. The traditional record industry has been criticized for being slow to offer music online and to provide affordable licenses to Internet companies that are seeking to do so. Senator Hatch, who presided over hearings on the subject last spring, noted that some creative business alliances have since been struck. But he continued to raise the specter of regulation. ''It is critical that policy makers be vigilant about keeping the pipes wide open,'' the senator said, adding that as a songwriter himself he shared the frustrations of artists who find it hard to get adequate distribution and compensation for their music. ''If the digital pipes are significantly narrowed by gatekeepers who divert fans to preferred content, a unique opportunity will be lost for creators of music and those fans,'' he said.</p>

        <p>TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: E-COMMERCE  Correction:  January 12, 2001, Friday  A report in the Technology Briefing column of Business Day yesterday about a conference on the music business and the Internet referred incorrectly to a speaker, Senator Orrin Hatch.
