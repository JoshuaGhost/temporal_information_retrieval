        <p>Getting a Break During a Break</p>
        <p>The things they talk about at Court TV when the audience is watching the commercials: RIKKI KLIEMAN, an anchor, laid the groundwork for her husband's new job with one of her on-air guests.</p>
        <p>Her husband -- WILLIAM J. BRATTON, the former police commissioner who flirted with but decided against running for mayor this year -- has just joined Kroll Associates, a security and investigations company in Manhattan. JEFFREY SCHLANGER, a managing director and chief operating officer of Kroll's security services group, credits Ms. Klieman with mentioning Mr. Bratton's availability on a break in a Court TV interview last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton is not the only former city official who has signed on with Kroll in recent weeks. JEROME M. HAUER, who was the director of the mayor's Office of Emergency Management from 1996 until last February, has been hired to run a new crisis management group at Kroll.</p>
        <p>''They are each so excited about being with each other that it's like boys on a team who were picked together as draft picks,'' Ms. Klieman said before a party for the two men last night. ''They look at each other and they go, 'Wow, I get to play with him.' I witnessed that the first time I met Jerry Hauer. I really found that within a nanosecond I was so comfortable with Jerry Hauer. He's the same kind of guy as Bill. They're idea people who both have big egos and yet are modest.'' Mr. Hauer joined a consulting firm in Washington after he left City Hall last year. He said he quit because ''they basically wanted me down there full time'' and he wanted to spend time in New York. In November, he called Mr. Schlanger. ''He had mentioned that Bill might be coming on board,'' Mr. Hauer said. ''The opportunity to work with him again was a great magnet. Bill and I maintained some contact over the last few years. Don't tell Rudy that -- it could get me in trouble.''</p>
        <p>TV Series Spawns A Few Firsts</p>
        <p>It's not that SIDNEY LUMET is a stranger to television. Mr. Lumet, 76, directed more than 250 episodes of television shows in the 1950's, before he switched to film and made such classics as ''12  Angry Men'' and ''Dog Day Afternoon.''</p>
        <p>But the new series ''100 Centre Street'' is a first: his first television series, period.</p>
        <p>As if that were not enough, it is also his first series on cable. And the A&amp;E network, which will carry ''100 Centre Street'' on Mondays at 9 p.m., says it is the first series in the country shot in its entirety in high-definition television.</p>
        <p>That explains why A&amp;E rented the Clearview Cinema on East 62nd Street for a screening on Wednesday -- the Clearview is one of only a few movie theaters in Manhattan that can project HDTV as well as conventional films. After watching the first two episodes of ''100 Centre Street,'' the audience -- which included PAUL SHAFFER, MANDY PATINKIN, E. L. DOCTOROW, NORA EPHRON, NICHOLAS PILEGGI  and ADOLPH GREEN, as well as cast members of ''100 Centre Street'' like ALAN ARKIN and Mr. Green's wife, PHYLLIS NEWMAN -- went to a party at Gustavino's, a restaurant on East 59th Street.</p>
        <p>There, one of the stars of the show, LaTANYA RICHARDSON, said that she had had to struggle to find something likable in the conservative judge she plays. ''Anyone who knows me know that I am the softest touch, and she's a Republican!'' she said of her Judge Sims. Her preparation for the role? ''I had lunch with Judge Judy.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Richardson's husband, SAMUEL L. JACKSON, said that he saw parts of her in Judge Sims. ''Some parts of that judge remind me of home, and I'm sure our daughter would say so, too.''</p>
        <p>Musical's Stars Meet With a Bush</p>
        <p>BARBARA BUSH went backstage and chatted with the cast of ''Contact'' on Wednesday at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center.  ''I'm from Texas -- it's one of the first things I said,'' one of the stars, DEBORAH YATES, said later. ''President Bush had spoken at my college graduation.'' (That was in 1992, at Southern Methodist University.)</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Yates stumped Mrs. Bush. ''I'm from a small town, Jacksonville, two hours east of Dallas, that she'd never heard of. I said, 'Near Tyler.' She knew that. She said she was sure her husband had been through there. Of course, he didn't get elected the second time.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  January 13, 2001, Saturday  A report in the Public Lives column yesterday about the director Sidney Lumet misspelled the name of a Manhattan restaurant where a party was held after a screening of his new television series. It is Guastavino's, not Gustavino's.</p>
