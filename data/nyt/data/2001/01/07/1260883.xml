        <p>THE mutual fund business was booming during the early days of Green, a personal finance magazine for young adults -- think 22 to 35 years old -- that I started in 1994. Fund managers like Peter Lynch, Michael Price and Donald Yacktman practically had their own bubble-gum cards as the 2 percent trickle of the Dow industrials of 1994 gave way to the 33 percent torrent of 1995, with more gains to follow. With a truckload of glowing press clippings and a hornet's nest of buzz, Green's advertising sales force (my high school pal, the co-founder) set out to honor the mutual fund industry with the chance to buy real estate in our pages.</p>
        <p>It seemed a no-brainer. Mutual funds were spending a fortune on advertising, up to $270 million in 1996, from $174 million in 1995. The funds' marketing materials talked endlessly about the magic of compound interest -- how a few dollars a month for 40 years becomes millions by retirement time. Well, who else but Green had a readership with a 40-year time horizon? Ultimately, there was a good reason we had that audience to ourselves: nobody else wanted it.</p>

        <p>THE mutual fund business was booming during the early days of Green, a personal finance magazine for young adults -- think 22 to 35 years old -- that I started in 1994. Fund managers like Peter Lynch, Michael Price and Donald Yacktman practically had their own bubble-gum cards as the 2 percent trickle of the Dow industrials of 1994 gave way to the 33 percent torrent of 1995, with more gains to follow. With a truckload of glowing press clippings and a hornet's nest of buzz, Green's advertising sales force (my high school pal, the co-founder) set out to honor the mutual fund industry with the chance to buy real estate in our pages.</p>
        <p>It seemed a no-brainer. Mutual funds were spending a fortune on advertising, up to $270 million in 1996, from $174 million in 1995. The funds' marketing materials talked endlessly about the magic of compound interest -- how a few dollars a month for 40 years becomes millions by retirement time. Well, who else but Green had a readership with a 40-year time horizon? Ultimately, there was a good reason we had that audience to ourselves: nobody else wanted it.</p>
        <p>I'm not just pleading my own case. How much of the $1.5 billion spent to advertise mutual funds during the last five years has found its way into Spin or Rolling Stone? You won't hear any mutual fund commercials on Howard Stern's show or on MTV.</p>
        <p>Fund companies talk about reaching young people but are actually much more interested in reaching those investors who are closer to a gold watch.</p>
        <p>''The fund companies' most lucrative market are those customers about to retire or newly retired,'' according to Stephen Cohn, founder of  Sage Online, a mutual fund discussion site. ''Every mutual fund company we talk to says they want to be in the retirement area and reach the 50- to 65-year-old. They're the most profitable customer.''</p>
        <p>MARLA BRILL, the president of FundsInteractive.com, a Web site that tracks the industry, said the fund companies had ''basically abandoned the smaller investor.''</p>
        <p>''They should look at what the investor is going to be like 10 years from now,'' she added.</p>
        <p>But it is not all that surprising that they do not. A customer who has invested $1,000 costs a fund company about the same in prospectuses, account statements and toll-free phone calls as a customer with a hundred times that amount -- and maybe costs it even more, given the extra hand-holding that a new investor may need.</p>
        <p>From the fund company's perspective, the break-even point for each new customer can be several years: three or four is standard, depending on average account size, marketing costs and other variables. And judging from figures from the  Investment Company Institute, the average holding period for a single fund is less than three years -- not long enough to make money for the fund company.</p>
        <p>Fund company managers will not say they are intentionally avoiding young investors. But time and again, Green was told a variation of ''We love your publication, but we lose money on every account with less than $25,000.''</p>
        <p>Sure, they might have been just saying that to avoid bruising our tender egos. But it is borne out by the remarks that some fund representatives make for the record.</p>
        <p>Chris Doyle at American Century funds says his company shoots for an older (read: more affluent) investor. ''Our demographic is 35 to 50,'' he said. ''We're doing some sports advertising -- Sunday football and ESPN, so it's arguably viewed by a younger audience, but that's really the only effort aimed at younger people.''</p>
        <p>Or as Brian Mattes, the spokesman for Vanguard Investments, says: ''We don't pursue our marketing by age cohorts. We place an ad in Money or The Wall Street Journal to reach who you reach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattes said it was as much about frame of mind as it was about age and affluence. ''If you were to look at certain demographic data, you could construct a case for advertising in Smithsonian, Architectural Digest. The problem with that is that the reader has his antenna tuned to something different -- they're reading for kitchen ideas, not for investment advice.''</p>
        <p>Burton J. Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant in Philadelphia, has another theory. ''There's a reluctance on the part of large financial institutions to risk their reputation,'' he said. '' 'What would the great body of our shareholders think if we're cheek by jowl with some half-naked hip-hop singer on MTV?' Just as they don't want to advertise on billboards coming out of the airport in Las Vegas -- they won't risk the perception that they're not serious with other people's money.''</p>
        <p>SOME fund companies, notably Monetta, American Express and Stein Roe, via its Young Investor fund, have not pursued the 25-year-old new to the job market, but instead have gone after the 15-year-old kid brother or sister. Or, more specifically, the parents of those who are young enough to need custodial accounts.</p>
        <p>They dress up the custodial accounts with bright colors and a neat  special certificate, and stock the portfolio with child-friendly companies (anything but smokes, booze and gambling). Very low minimums help youngsters get started -- just $100 for Stein Roe investors who agree to contribute $50 a month, $250 for Monetta with automatic $25 monthlies.</p>
        <p>Some fund companies, like SunAmerica and Nuveen, have made strides toward improving America's notoriously poor job of educating our youngsters about personal finance. Both companies have started programs in hundreds of elementary and middle schools, at no cost to the school districts. Nuveen's program is in 800 schools in 47 states. It is a bit jarring, though, that a youngster  learns about investing through a program sponsored by a company like Nuveen, whose spokesman told me, ''Our business is focused on the affluent investor, who doesn't tend to be a young investor.''</p>
        <p>According to the National Center for Research in Economic Education, only half of America's high school students take an economics course, and just 39 percent of those are not baffled by simple calculations of exchange rates, according to the center's newest Test of Economic Literacy.</p>
        <p>There are a few incongruities here. For one, mutual funds are perhaps the very best vehicles for young investors -- and not only because of the arguable performance benefits of professional management. Young people can also benefit from the instant diversification, the discipline of automatic deposits, the simplicity of having short-  and long-term capital gains calculated and reported, and the convenience of dividend reinvestment.</p>
        <p>Despite their reputation for irresponsibility, young Americans are  eager to participate in their financial future. According to a comprehensive survey of some five million American employees at approximately 5,400 companies that offer 401(k) plans, about half of the eligible 20- to 29-year-olds participated, as did 69 percent of those aged 30 to 39. That compares with 73 percent of 40- to 49-year-olds and 75 percent of 50- to 59-year-olds. And the portions of income deferred by these groups were within a few percentage points of one another.</p>
        <p>So much for casting young investors as conscientious objectors. In fact, they are ready to buy shares -- if only the fund companies would deign to sell them.</p>
