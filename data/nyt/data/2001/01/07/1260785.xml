        <p>SEVENTY-FIVE DAYS and counting.</p>
        <p>Under a 100-day deadline, community groups in Stamford and Greenwich are in a whirlwind of fund-raising to collect $11.5 million for the purchase of 110 acres of open space from the International Paper Company.</p>
        <p>The property, known as Treetops, straddles the borders of the City of Stamford and the Town of Greenwich and runs along the Mianus River. It is the former estate of Libby Holman, a singer who was married to the heir to the Reynolds tobacco fortune, and the largest privately owned parcel of undeveloped land in lower Fairfield County. International Paper, which owns the site, has given the Trust for Public Land, a national conservancy group that is handing the deal along with the community groups, until Jan. 31 to buy the property. Otherwise, it will go back on the market.</p>
        <p>So far, about $10 million has been raised and the show of public support has taken fund-raising organizers by surprise. In one meeting of the Greenwich Land Trust, which had already pledged $300,000 toward the purchase, for instance, the board members, after hearing another presentation about the site, anted up another $400,000, but this time out of their own pockets..</p>
        <p>''It just blew me away,'' said David Ogilvy, vice president of the Greenwich Land Trust and the organizer of 100 Days To Save Treetops.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the Holman estate offered the property to Stamford for $1 in 1973 after Ms. Holman's death in 1971. The city turned down the offer because it did not want to pay for maintaining the property.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the owner of the property, Champion International, which has since been taken over by International Paper, announced it would sell the land. The Toombs Development Company of New Canaan and Brickman Associates of New York City made proposals to purchase the land for housing developments.</p>
        <p>Late last summer, Brickman Associates signed a letter of intent to purchase and develop the property from International Paper. However, when it became apparent that the communities wanted the land preserved, International Paper decided to give them a Jan. 31 deadline to gather the money to buy Treetops, said James Melican, executive vice president of International Paper.</p>
        <p>''Now that the Town of Greenwich and Stamford and the State of Connecticut are prepared to step up to the plate on this and the fact there is indication of private support in the form of private contribution, there is an interest in preserving as much open space in the area as possible,'' Mr. Melican said. ''We are pleased that the communities have indicated an interest in purchasing the land.''</p>
        <p>Brickman Associates is suing International Paper for breach of contract over the issue.</p>
        <p>Conservation experts and local officials have longed feared the sale of Treetops to developers. In their view, a housing development would seriously impact the water quality of 130,000 local residents, as well as damage sensitive ecosystems in the Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>So a coalition that includes the Trust For Public Land, the Greenwich Land Trust, the Stamford Land Conservation Trust, local conservation groups and private citizens have been trying to raise the money..</p>
        <p>Under the purchasing agreement, International Paper will sell all the land, except for the mansion on the site and 17 surrounding acres around the house, to the Trust for Public Land. The property will become part of the Mianus River Greenway, which starts at the Mianus River Gorge and will run contiguously for 330 acres. The State Department of Environmental Protection will take title to the Treetops site.</p>
        <p>''For us, to be able to protect this piece of property, we had to come in with a market offer,'' said Tim Northrup, Connecticut state director of the Trust for Public Land.</p>
        <p>The Trust for Public Land put up the nonrefundable, $500,000 deposit for the land, Mr. Northrup said. Once the deposit was made, the state came up with an initial $3.5 million pledge for the property.</p>
        <p>Although final approval is needed from the Representative Town Meeting in Greenwich and the Board of Representatives in Stamford, each town has pledged $1.5 million. Stamford is scheduled to vote on the final appropriation tomorrow and Greenwich's final vote for the funding is scheduled for Jan. 16.</p>
        <p>Private community campaigns are being conducted through the land trusts in Greenwich and Stamford.</p>
        <p>''I'm receiving checks for $25 to $2,000 daily from ordinary citizens who care,'' said Percy Lee Langstaff, president of the Stamford Land Conservation Trust. ''And that's terribly exciting that people care. We're working like crazy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Langstaff said her volunteer organization has already sent another mailing for donations. In addition, her fund-raising committee is concentrating on talking to people and, hopefully, finding someone who will make a large donation before the deadline.</p>
        <p>''We're calling on individuals everyday,'' she said. ''People who we hear have money. We're trying to find an angel to come across with a big, big sum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogilvy said he volunteered to head up the ''100 Day'' scramble for Treetops without an organization or fund-raising materials.</p>
        <p>To his advantage, he said, he had an enthusiastic group of citizens willing to go out and raise money. His committee of five ''talked to people quietly to raise some major dollars,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''What you expect is first people will give to the school, then the hospital and then religious institutions,'' he said. ''You don't expect land conservation to be high on that list. But it is now.''</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Ogilvy joked that his friends run from him, they have sent their checks to support the effort. So far, his volunteers have raised $3.5 million, including the Greenwich Land Trust's initial $700,000.</p>
        <p>The whole Treetops initiative, according to David Leff, deputy commissioner for Environmental Conservation with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, is the type of cooperative effort the state wants to jump-start with public and private groups around the state. In recent years, the state is seeing more and more partnerships of this type forming to preserve open space in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''If we are going to preserve sufficient open space and the character of our landscape, it has to be more than government that does it,'' he said. ''Cooperation between public and private interests is a must.''</p>
        <p>As part of a program to preserve open space, Gov. John G. Rowland in 1998 set a 25-year goal to guarantee preservation of 21 percent of the state's open land. This initiative was put into subsequent legislation.</p>
        <p>It has taken the state 100 to reach two-thirds of that 21 percent goal, Mr. Leff said. When the last third of that goal is met, he estimated, at least one in five acres of state land will be held in perpetuity by private land trusts, state municipalities and water companies.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, Connecticut's $42 million open space acquisition program has acquired more than 7,000 acres of new state land and another 7,000 acres through 92 open space projects funded through the Open Space and Watershed Land Acquisition Grant Program, he said.</p>
        <p>But the key to the recent success of the program, he added, is the public's willingness to preserve open space, even in towns and communities less prosperous than Fairfield County.</p>
