        <p>THEY'RE back, all those old hands and familiar faces from the reigns of Bush the elder, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford.

        <p>THEY'RE back, all those old hands and familiar faces from the reigns of Bush the elder, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. All that comfortable expertise that kept the Republicans in the White House throughout the 1980's, prompting the commentator Christopher Matthews to declare it ''the Daddy Party,'' in whose capable hands the nation entrusted the cold war and the economy.</p>
        <p>The word in Washington now is ''restoration,'' as in the return of a ruling family ousted by an angry electorate (in the case of George I in 1992, whose son, George W. Bush, now returns after eight years in the provinces) or a civil war followed by a beheading (in the case of Charles I in 1649, whose son, Charles II, returned to the throne 11 years later). For Republicans, it is a deeply reassuring time, a return to order, to stability, to the way things used to be and should have stayed.</p>
        <p>Except things aren't what they used to be.  Washington has changed during the unruly Clinton years, in ways that may prove unsettling for returning Republicans. It is faster, rougher, more partisan. ''I left government in late '83 and returned in '93 and I was stunned by how much of a change had taken place,'' said David R. Gergen, who served in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. ''We entered a new world in the 1990's, politically.''</p>
        <p>Congress has become utterly unpredictable -- no longer controlled by the Democrats, but not really controlled by the Republicans either. Even Representative David Dreier of California, an optimistic Bush ally and chairman of the House Rules Committee, acknowledges, ''No one has dealt with a situation as close as this.''</p>
        <p>Policy-making is different, too. Major initiatives -- say, restructuring Medicare as President-elect Bush is proposing -- are now hashed out in the open, amid a barrage of interest group advertising and high-tech lobbying, a legacy of the health-care wars of 1993-94. ''Part of Bush's choices, I think, is a longing to go back to the old world -- where seasoned men made the decisions and everybody listened,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. In recent years, seasoned men seem to have become just one more constituent group.</p>
        <p>The old hands on the Bush team were not exactly off in Kazakhstan for the past decade, as Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, put it. Most have stayed involved, in commissions, campaigns or private-sector jobs just barely removed from the public sector. Two come straight from the Senate. But nothing is quite like the intensity of the White House.</p>
        <p>The leisurely news cycle of the 1980's is long gone. CNN was a force in the last Bush administration, but the number of media outlets has exploded since then, not to mention the Internet. ''It used to be you had to feed the media beast,'' said S. Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ''Now you have to corral it.'' Mr. Lichter added, ''When some of these guys were last here, the only video game was Pong.''</p>
        <p>And, of course, the issues have changed.  To state the obvious, foreign policy is no longer consumed with managing the cold war, and no single overarching threat has emerged to replace it. A recent report by the intelligence community concluded that global issues like food and water shortages, disease and changes in population will increasingly affect the national security of the United States -- issues requiring a far different mindset than the rivalry of superpowers.</p>
        <p>And without the towering threat of the Soviet Union, foreign policy has become more politicized, the old notion of differences ''ending at the water's edge'' a quaint remnant of another time.</p>
        <p>On the domestic front, one happier change for the Republicans is the existence of a surplus as far as the eye can see. But there's also a slowing economy and a skittish stock market, a matter of immense concern to what has become a nation of stockholders over the past eight years. The domestic agenda, which increasingly reflects an aging society, is complicated -- issues like prescription drugs, Medicare and Social Security -- and particularly hard to deal with during the permanent campaign. Even some of Mr. Bush's allies think he has underestimated how hard it will be to win bipartisan support for a Medicare overhaul with the House up for grabs in 2002.</p>
        <p>These difficulties may be obscured, at the moment, by the sweet sense of Restoration in the House of Bush. It is an old story line: the father rejected, the son welcomed back by a regretful nation, avenging old wrongs. Charles I waged a long struggle with Parliament, culminating in civil wars and his own beheading on charges of treason. Parliament's victory led to the rule of Oliver Cromwell. But after his death, the nation turned to Charles II, who returned amid great rejoicing.</p>
        <p>The Bush story is, yes, a tad less dramatic. And Kevin Phillips, the political analyst and author of ''The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics and the Triumph of Anglo-America'' (Basic Books, 1999), takes a hard-nosed view of the whole business: ''In the sense that restorations always bring back the old crowd, that's one of the handicaps. Their A-team is the same crowd that lost to Jimmy Carter, for Pete's sake.''</p>
        <p>The adjustments facing the new Bush cabinet can, of course, be overstated. As Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman, put it, ''It isn't like they just drifted off and came back like Rip Van Winkle.'' Indeed, some were in on the beginning of the zeitgeist shift, like Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff into the early years of the Clinton administration and fought, in the Persian Gulf war, the first war televised in real time.</p>
        <p>''They've adapted too; they grew up in that atmosphere,'' said Tom Korologos, a longtime Republican lobbyist now helping with the Bush transition. ''That's the beauty of the Bush cabinet -- they're all adults. This group can run a government tonight.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Phillips scoffs, ''They've been off picking the tall cotton in the corporate world, and that gives you a different  mindset.''</p>
        <p>A CLOSE analysis of Bush I may help. Just weeks after the elder Bush took office, dramatically offering his hand to Congressional Democrats in his Inaugural Address, Democrats rejected his nominee for defense secretary, Senator John G. Tower. It was considered a seminal event in the partisan wars that followed -- not least because it triggered Dick Cheney's move to defense, which opened the way for Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia to win a position in the Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>After that, mostly during the Clinton years, came the deluge: a Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, the fall of House speakers, the impeachment of a president, a president elected without a popular vote majority and a brutal near-parity between the two parties that means the next campaign is already under way. The old Democratic Congressional majority that confronted Mr. Bush's Republican predecessors was not easy, but it was stable.</p>
        <p>''You could cut a deal, and it would stick,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''The negotiations that go into putting together a large bipartisan bill are far more difficult today than they were in the past.''</p>
        <p>On the Hill and off, the rules are different.  If the new president likes, he can take solace from Charles II, who thrived in the new political world that Cromwell had helped create -- in contrast to his successor, James II, an unpopular ruler who died in exile.</p>
        <p>Jim Jordan, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, gave a hint of what awaits just beyond the glow of this newest restoration. ''If he thinks this is going to be the Texas Legislature, and has people in for barbecue and horseshoes and that's enough, he's in for a surprise,'' Mr. Jordan said.</p>
