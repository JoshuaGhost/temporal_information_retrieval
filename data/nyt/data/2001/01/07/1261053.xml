        <p>Two years ago, Brian McCauley's wife, Vicki, lay in the intensive care unit at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, silently battling leukemia and a collapsed windpipe.</p>
        <p>As she lay in bed, kept alive by a respirator, Mr. McCauley put on a brave face for their three sons, Brian Jason, then 18; Daniel, 13; and Sean, 7.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want the kids to get too scared,'' Mr. McCauley said. ''You have to go home and screw a smile on your face.''</p>
        <p>The idea was to keep the children's home life as normal as possible. Mr. McCauley and his mother helped them with their homework and did the laundry and the dishes and the grocery shopping.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCauley was worried. Every day he visited his wife at the hospital, but she never seemed to show any progress. ''For the first five and a half months she wasn't getting any better,'' he said. ''You cling to any hope you can. I said, 'Well, she's not getting any worse.' ''</p>
        <p>The hospital searched the country and Europe for bone marrow donors but found none. So Mrs. McCauley was treated with an experimental drug based on arsenic. ''With the course of this new drug, we were able to get the disease down to very, very low levels,'' said Dr. Joseph Jurcic, who supervised her treatment.</p>
        <p>In May 1999, Mrs. McCauley began to breathe on her own again. She could communicate by typing into a machine that spoke her words with an artificial voice. Dr. Jurcic said that tests conducted that spring showed she was largely cured, but not completely.</p>
        <p>''We didn't see any detectable leukemia cells,'' Dr. Jurcic said recently. ''It was below the level of detectability, but there can still be some leukemia cells present.''</p>
        <p>He prescribed high doses of chemotherapy and full-body radiation to kill any leukemic cells in Mrs. McCauley's bone marrow. In August 1999, she was injected with healthy stem cells, which had been taken from her blood when the disease was almost gone. It looked as though she was on the road to recovery.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. McCauley was fired.</p>
        <p>He had been a supervisor at a company in Mamaroneck, N.Y., that created and cared for plant landscapes in Manhattan skyscrapers. But his boss told him he was not paying enough attention to his job, Mr. McCauley said.</p>
        <p>''They were a little annoyed that I couldn't work as much overtime as they wanted,'' he said. The fact that the hospital was frequently calling him with questions and reports about his wife did not help, either.</p>
        <p>So in November 1999, the same month that Mrs. McCauley came home to the family's apartment in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Mr. McCauley lost his income and the family had a new problem: paying the rent and the utility bills. (Medicaid covered most of the family's medical bills.)</p>
        <p>Mr. McCauley got a part-time job at another interior landscaping company, but the company gave him work only when it needed extra help. The family struggled to get by on Mrs. McCauley's disability income and Mr. McCauley's part-time work.</p>
        <p>''We were doing the best we could,'' Mr. McCauley said, ''but we got really behind.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. McCauley, who had been a bookkeeper and a waitress, felt helpless. ''I couldn't even move,'' she said. ''I did nothing but lie in bed all day. Even to go to the bathroom was completely exhausting.''</p>
        <p>In December 1999, five months behind on their rent and fearing eviction, they went to their church, the Bay Ridge United Methodist Church. The pastor, Scott Summerville, and his wife, Mary Ellen, asked the congregation to help the family with a hot meal once a week and contacted the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.</p>
        <p>The federation provided $1,064 -- about a month and a half's worth of rent -- to keep the McCauleys from being evicted. Paying a little of the back rent each month, the family has been able to pay back most of the remainder.</p>
        <p>The bone marrow reconstruction procedure for Mrs. McCauley appears to have worked, and Dr. Jurcic said that if Mrs. McCauley's blood shows no signs of leukemia for two more years, the chances of a relapse would be very low.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McCauley, 44, said recently that by using state and city financial aid packages, she hoped she could return to Kingsborough Community College, where she completed a semester studying early childhood education before she was hospitalized. Her goal, she said, is to become a preschool teacher.</p>
        <p>''I was disappointed that I had to stop going to school,'' Mrs. McCauley said. ''Maybe in September, when everything's back to normal, I'll be able to go back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCauley, 42, has returned to school himself, though he had to take out a loan to do so. At the Technical Career Institutes in Midtown Manhattan, he is learning how to repair refrigeration and heating systems with the hope that he can find a full-time job when he graduates.</p>
        <p>''I figured I would learn something totally different,'' he said. ''It's good to have two different things to do.''</p>
        <p>With the immediate threat of leukemia removed, Mrs. McCauley is able to reflect on the disease, and on the cancers that took the lives of both her mother and her grandmother. ''I guess if it was a different age, I also would die,'' she said. ''But I was born in this age. I was able to survive.''</p>
