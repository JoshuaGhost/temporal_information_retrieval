        <p>AFTER roll call at 8 a.m., the busload of 40 passengers, fully grown but giddy as school kids on holiday, left Tucson and headed south toward Mexico. Five guides, passing around a microphone, started pointing out historic landmarks, putting names on mountain ranges and desert plants, explaining the lay of the land and the chronology of its inhabitants.

        <p>Every March, April, October and November for the past 26 years, the Southwestern Mission Research Center, based in Tucson, has been taking people to visit seven or eight of the string of 27 Catholic missions established by Jesuit and Franciscan priests in the parched, prickly and bizarrely beautiful desert fastness of northwestern Mexico. This region and adjacent southern Arizona (which until 1821 was part of Spain and then of Mexico until 1854) has long been known as the Pimería Alta, a reference to the northern group of Indians called Pimas by the Spaniards and now more commonly called O'odham (pronounced, approximately, ah-ah-DOM), which means ''the people'' in their own language.</p>

        <p>AFTER roll call at 8 a.m., the busload of 40 passengers, fully grown but giddy as school kids on holiday, left Tucson and headed south toward Mexico. Five guides, passing around a microphone, started pointing out historic landmarks, putting names on mountain ranges and desert plants, explaining the lay of the land and the chronology of its inhabitants. An hour later, at our border crossing in Nogales, we boarded another bus and were off on a three-day fact-packed immersion into the world of O'odham Indians, the Sonoran Desert, and the indefatigable 17th-century Jesuit missionary Eusebio Francisco Kino.</p>
        <p>Every March, April, October and November for the past 26 years, the Southwestern Mission Research Center, based in Tucson, has been taking people to visit seven or eight of the string of 27 Catholic missions established by Jesuit and Franciscan priests in the parched, prickly and bizarrely beautiful desert fastness of northwestern Mexico. This region and adjacent southern Arizona (which until 1821 was part of Spain and then of Mexico until 1854) has long been known as the Pimería Alta, a reference to the northern group of Indians called Pimas by the Spaniards and now more commonly called O'odham (pronounced, approximately, ah-ah-DOM), which means ''the people'' in their own language.</p>
        <p>The churches are often referred to as Kino missions -- not because Father Kino established each and every one of them but because he was the first Roman Catholic priest to hazard the assignment of converting unknown subjects in this arid and thorny landscape.</p>
        <p>The Kino missions, some crumbling ruins, others still thriving churches, are windows onto a time when a scattering of stoic  desert-dwelling Indians were besieged by priests who desired their souls and by Apaches who hectored and stole from them.</p>
        <p>Kino was born in Italy in 1645 and educated in Austria. He arrived in the Pimería Alta in 1687 and began to establish a beachhead among the O'odham. Over the next quarter century he founded 27 missions, covering much of the territory of northern Sonora and southern Arizona, an expanse of some 62,000 square miles.</p>
        <p>It is hard to fathom what resources of optimism, faith, charity, entrepreneurship or fanaticism Father Kino possessed to head off into such inhospitable terrain. But head off he did, and in so doing he left an indelible footprint in the desert. Besides the liturgy, Father Kino brought wheat and livestock. Today, Sonora and southern Arizona remain ranching and farming cultures, and the daily bread is flour -- not corn -- tortillas.</p>
        <p>One of the great pleasures of terrestrial travel is the succession of fleeting, almost dreamlike images, framed like paintings in the bus window, of landscapes, people, dogs, buildings, plazas, the sky, livestock. From this trip, I will always remember women in roadside stands tossing and flipping giant paper-thin tortillas made, at least in a metaphorical sense, with Father Kino's wheat.</p>
        <p>In three days in April we visited eight missions, all within a radius of about 60 miles and barely 50 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border. We encamped both nights in Caborca at Motel El Camino, a lodge where the friendly staff and good food made up for some infrastructure lapses, such as the less than reliable supply of hot water.</p>
        <p>The proximity of the missions to the United States, along with increasing, if somewhat spartan, tourist accommodations in the region resulting from the booming Nafta economy, means that mission-seekers could do this route on their own. But they would forgo the joys of the Southwestern Center's tour, which include the abundant knowledge and enthusiasm of the guides, the camaraderie of the group, the confidence of being with numerous people fluent in Spanish, and the miraculous appearance at 10:30 a.m. every day of an ice chest laden with an assortment of Mexican cervezas. One must treasure those rare times in life when the transfer of knowledge can be chased with ice-cold beer.</p>
        <p>Although the Kino tour focuses on events of 300 years ago, the guides and participants (at least those on our tour) savor the present. Our first stop was in Ímuris, a small town about 35 miles south of Nogales, where the cafe in the bus station is noted for its cuisine. Not a timid eater among us, we were soon feasting on exquisite quesadillas con nopales (the tangy pads of prickly-pear cactus). On the evening of the second day, in the town of Caborca, our party scattered to benches around the perimeter of the plaza at Mission La Purísima Concepción de Nuestra Señora and, in the waning romance of the setting sun, watched a wedding in progress.</p>
        <p>The first mission on the tour was Nuestra Señora del Pilar y Santiago de Cocóspera, on the mountainous Highway 2 about halfway between Ímuris and Cananea. It sits on a bluff above the valley of the Río Babasac. A dissolving pile of adobe and brick, it is saved from total decay by a scaffolding erected in the 1980's by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia.</p>
        <p>In its poignant state of suspended animation, Nuestra Señora del Pilar y Santiago was a concise introduction to the pulses of prosperity and decline that characterized the interplay among the O'odham, the Catholic missionaries and the Apaches, who had become master raiders after acquiring horses from the Spanish conquistadors.</p>
        <p>Kino established the mission in the late 1680's, and its first church was dedicated in 1704, after the Apaches had burned a previous church to the ground in 1698. The new mission and its O'odham converts, or semiconverts, experienced a brief time of relative calm until 1711 when Kino died and things began to unravel. In 1746 the Apaches torched the mission. In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled by King Carlos III of Spain to be replaced a year later by Franciscan priests. The last Franciscan left Cocóspera in 1836. The Apaches continued to hammer the mission and the Indians, and by the 1840's it was abandoned.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Jesuit pragmatists -- believers in commerce, innovation, resource development, hard work and no nonsense -- the Franciscans inspired a broad interest in literature and the arts (including that of the natives). At Cocóspera the Franciscan priests and O'odham artisans left their stamp on the simple adobe Jesuit mission. They added a fired-brick facade, a barrel-vaulted ceiling and interior decoration. Indeed, the scaffolding at Cocóspera was constructed to keep an elaborate Franciscan facade from peeling off its plain Jesuit face.</p>
        <p>The best preserved and most ornate expression of Franciscan art and architecture is Mission San Xavier del Bac, on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, 10 miles south of Tucson. It is usually the grand finale on the Kino mission trip, unless, as in our case, border-crossing delays throw the tour off schedule. It is certainly worth a pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>Against its desert backdrop, San Xavier del Bac can almost be mistaken for a shimmering white mirage. Jesuits established the mission and erected their last church here in 1756. In 1781, the Franciscan priest Juan Bautista Velderrain started the very ambitious and expensive task of constructing San Xavier. He died before it was completed 16 years later. San Xavier del Bac is a thriving church that is open daily.</p>
        <p>A distinctive refrain among the Kino missions is their settings. Every one we visited stood on a prominence near a river. The practicalities of placement are obvious. The church, priest and his O'odham flock were protected from flooding (desert rivers often rampage during summer monsoons), but close enough to tend the flood plain fields, where crops were planted.</p>
        <p>The elevation also provided a long view -- allowing the O'odham to see the Apaches in time to retreat to the mission, which then became a fortress. Practicalities have a way of providing other gratifications, which include the ineffable pleasure of standing on the brow of a hill overlooking a broad valley.</p>
        <p>While Nuestra Señora del Pilar y Santiago de Cocóspera is a bona fide  ruin, the other missions we visited over the next two days are very much part of the religious present. People worship in them and mill on their plazas and bedeck their cemeteries with mementos. When our group arrived on Saturday morning at Mission San Antonio de Padua in the village of Oquitoa, a parishioner, heedless of interlopers, was pulling ropes to ring the twin bells in the dazzling white belfry.</p>
        <p>The cemetery at Mission San Antonio de Padua de Oquitoa is an especially vivid reminder of the Hispanic attentiveness to the departed. It is elbow-to-elbow with funereal statuary (also blinding white) garlanded with bright plastic flowers. (The mission tours in October often coincide with preparations for the Día de los Muertos, when Mexican families honor the dead with picnics and elaborate graveside decorations.)</p>
        <p>All the missions possess an atmosphere of serenity -- the interior shade and coolness provided by thick adobe walls are inviting on a sweltering day -- and each has a memorable or enigmatic element. I do not think my fellow travelers and I will soon forget the choir loft and spiral staircase of ancient mesquite timbers at Mission San Ignacio de Caburica in the village of Caburica, or the penitents at Santa María in Magdalena lifting the heavy wooden head of the recumbent statue of San Xavier (if a person is unable to lift the saint's head, he or she is deemed unrepentant), or the seashell-shaped entryway to Mission San Pedro y San Pablo del Tubutama, or the ghostly O'odham wall paintings of skeletons, animals, and Lucifer with a serpent's tail at San Diego Pitiquito, in the village of Pitiquito.</p>
        <p>BUT perhaps the most unforgettable and unexpected episode on the trip was encountering Father Kino himself. In 1711 Father Kino was visiting one of his new chapels in the village of Magdalena when he fell ill and died. He was laid to rest near the altar in the new chapel.</p>
        <p>As time passed, the exact location of the grave was lost while Father Kino's stock began to rise. He is a revered figure throughout Mexico, but especially in Sonora and Arizona (his statue stands in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda as a representative of the state), so in 1965 a team of international investigators was appointed to search for his remains. Eight months later, and 255 years after his death, they found Father Kino. Today, in the plaza of Magdalena de Kino (the city changed its name after the discovery of his remains) he lies under a glass dome on the dusty Sonoran Desert earth for all pilgrims to view. His skull has two incisors missing, and a dainty cassock button is perched on his breastbone.</p>

        <p>Guides</p>
        <p>An excellent guidebook to the missions is ''The Pimeria Alta: Missions and More,'' edited by James E. Officer, Mardith Schuetz-Miller and Bernard L. Fontana and published by the Southwestern Mission Research Center.</p>
        <p>The classic Kino life history is ''Rim of Christendom, a Biography of Eusebio Francisco Kino, Pacific Coast Pioneer,'' by Herbert Eugene Bolton.</p>
        <p>''Kino: A Legacy,'' by Charles W. Polzer, S.J., is an up-to-date biography and history of the missions.</p>
