        <p>NOT long ago, my 11-year-old, who has as much use for perfume as he does for ticks, caught a whiff of my fragrance and grinned. ''Yum,'' he murmured, sniffing the air greedily. ''You smell like essence of ice cream.''</p>
        <p>The scent that made his nose twitch was a blend of coffee and vanilla extracts, an aroma so dense one could almost taste it. And that, I suppose, was its point. Fragrance and cosmetics makers have long known that cooking and baking smells, so enticing to a child, can be a whiff of heaven to their elders too.</p>

        <p>NOT long ago, my 11-year-old, who has as much use for perfume as he does for ticks, caught a whiff of my fragrance and grinned. ''Yum,'' he murmured, sniffing the air greedily. ''You smell like essence of ice cream.''</p>
        <p>The scent that made his nose twitch was a blend of coffee and vanilla extracts, an aroma so dense one could almost taste it. And that, I suppose, was its point. Fragrance and cosmetics makers have long known that cooking and baking smells, so enticing to a child, can be a whiff of heaven to their elders too.</p>
        <p>But recently, many have raced to exploit that fact, whipping up food-related products so luscious, fresh and fragrant, they might have come from June Cleaver's kitchen. Cocoa, rice, tomato, ginger root -- these are among the homey foods that have become star ingredients in face creams, perfumes, cleansers, lip ointments and even deodorants.</p>
        <p>The popularity of the new products, which industry experts say account for tens of millions of dollars in sales, is fueled in part by the perception that to an  overstressed, emotionally frazzled society, food connotes comfort and safety.</p>
        <p>''Mother, home, food -- those words have made the industry perk up its nose,'' said Annette Green, chairwoman of the Sense of Smell Institute in New York, a nonprofit group that provides grants for researchers studying the effects of odors on behavior.</p>
        <p>To stroll these days into an outpost of Sephora, the international cosmetics chain, is to experience flavors and aromas more commonly encountered at candy stores and produce stands. Offered for sampling on small silver trays is a veritable larder of temptations: rice sake bath crystals, coffee body scrub, blueberry muffin shower gel and peanut butter lip balm, the last smelling suspiciously like Welch's grape jelly.</p>
        <p>In the next few months, a cornucopia of similar treats is expected to spill onto cosmetics counters. Allan Mottus, a New York cosmetics industry consultant, suggested that such products are a psychic Pablum to legions of shoppers. ''Smells that are naturally derived, like those in food, are having a very strong consumer response,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some health experts say that consumers often experience the scents of chocolate, bananas, brown sugar or soup as nourishing. ''A lot of these products are used to comfort,'' said Alice Domar, the author of ''Self-Nurture'' (Viking, 1999) and director of the Mind/Body Center for Women's Health at Harvard University. She pointed out that food-related beautifiers made some women feel cared for or energized. ''To some degree, they are a marketing gimmick -- they all  sound so wholesome,'' she said. ''But if they make you feel good, why not?''</p>
        <p>The lure of beauty products evoking food can be primal, appealing strongly to one's needy inner toddler. ''One reason they are so popular is that they make us all feel like children again,'' said Susan Anapol, the president of the American division of Comptoir Sud Pacifique, a French perfumer that began infusing its products with kitchen and bakery scents several decades ago and recently added some new kitchen and fruit garden scents to its line.</p>
        <p>The ingredients of beauty products are subject to trends, and odors that evoke the bakery, orchard or vegetable patch have turned up in cosmetics before, including Chap Stick's cherry-flavored lip balm and Fabergé's Wheat Germ and Honey shampoo. The difference now is that homey essences that once formed the background to more complex and alluring concoctions have acquired a glamour of their own as the star ingredients.</p>
        <p>Jean Godfrey-June, the beauty director of Lucky, a magazine about shopping, works hectic 10-hour days, and caters at home to her 3-year-old daughter, India. Her shower is her refuge for long massages with Brown Sugar Body Polish by Fresh, a Boston company. ''Using this stuff makes me feel indulged, like I'm a little kid and I'm getting what I want,'' Ms. Godfrey-June said. As a form of gratification it seems far more virtuous than raiding the fridge, she added with a laugh, ''like not having your cake and eating it too.''</p>
        <p>Not coincidentally, sugar and chocolate are among the most popular ingredients sweetening beauty creams, soaps and scents. Comptoir Sud's Lait Sucre exudes the faintly burnt aroma of crème brûlée, and the company's more recent entry, Coeur de Raisin, smells like a vineyard in spring. Sugar, a new fragrance from Fresh, is sweetened with citrus and bergamot.</p>
        <p>Other items are garnished with even more homely but tempting ingredients. Consider Brownie by Demeter, a company whose express mission is to captivate consumers with familiar food- and drink-related scents that range from the wholesome Cucumber to the decadent Martini.</p>
        <p>Philosophy, another small company with a cult following, extends the food concept to its packaging. Its Chocolate Chip Cookies Body Wash comes in a a box labeled ''Cookbook,'' with a blue-and-white gingham border framing a snapshot of a little girl standing in front of an old-fashioned kitchen range. Joey, another new company, offers Delipcious Chocolate-Dipped Strawberries lip balm, and Origins, a division of the Estée Lauder Companies, recently introduced Ginger Soufflé Moisture Lotion, with olive oil, rice bran, grape seed oil and apricot kernel oil. If it all sounds overpowering, one can always opt for the more delicate scent of Phillip B.'s White Truffle moisturizing shampoo, a hit at $45 at high-end outposts like Zitomer Pharmacy in New York.</p>
        <p>Truffles? Why not. ''If you're on a diet, you want to have rich food smells in your life,'' Ms. Green said. A recent study by the Sense of Smell Institute supported that assertion, suggesting that food-related creams and sprays can assuage the cravings of chronic dieters. Susan Schiffman, a professor of medical psychology who specializes in eating disorders at Duke University Medical School, discovered in a study that for some people, simply inhaling can be almost as satisfying as eating. ''What you want sometimes is just their smell or taste,'' not the sensation of chewing, she said.</p>
        <p>Those who experience sugary scents as guilt-inducing can turn instead to a proliferation of products purporting to be wholesome and, well, good for you. Once the staples of health food stores, they have lately insinuated themselves into more glamorous venues. Jeffrey New York, an outpost of hip on West 14th Street, sells Neal's Yard vitamin E and avocado night cream. Whole Body, the beauty division of Whole Foods, a national health food chain, showcases nutritious-sounding fare like its Milk &amp; Honey hydrating treatments, with apricot kernel, avocado and safflower oils. These are stocked alongside pumpkin and papaya enzyme peels, old-fashioned oatmeal soaps and olive oil body creams redolent of salad dressing.</p>
        <p>Even Banana Republic has entered the field, recently introducing Nutrients, a line of seven products including a chamomile, glycerin and grape seed oil body cream and a massage bar soap with wheat bran, hemp seed oil and vitamin C.</p>
        <p>Many such items attest to a recent stepped-up demand for natural beauty remedies. ''Consumers are absolutely afraid of chemicals,'' said Allyn Jones, product coordinator for the Whole Body collection. The company is betting that shoppers will respond to products that promise to improve their looks ''from the inside out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Food-based treatments ''used to be a West Coast thing -- they appealed to a fringe,'' said Karyn Grossman, a dermatologist with offices in New York and Beverly Hills. ''But now they are a lot bigger than that.'' Dr. Grossman routinely recommends papaya enzyme creams and lotions to her clients, not necessarily because they are better, she said, but because, to increasing numbers of people unnerved by labels listing a host of mysterious chemical compounds, a familiar ingredient like pumpkin can be reassuring. Are such homey ingredients, usually present only in minute amounts, effective? They are, but only to a degree, Dr. Grossman said. ''If your skin has been seriously damaged, you need a treatment that is more aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Operating perhaps on the premise that if a smear of chocolate or splash of milk is therapeutic, a bath in the stuff is akin to a weekend at Davos, many spas, where the current food craze was born, now slather their clients from head to heels in every kind of delicacy. One of the most popular treatments at the Origins Spa, at Chelsea Piers sports and entertainment complex in New York, is a ginger-scented massage followed by a brisk shower. A milk and honey pedicure is a favorite treat at Bliss, calming for burned-out New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>All that dabbing, lathering and pampering may seem like sensory overkill. But not to Mr. Mottus, the cosmetics consultant. He is currently nursing a theory that chocolate rubs and sugar-scented showers are a salve to the psyches of sensation-starved personalities, people who ''work all day in a very alienated space, never stopping, connected only to their computer screens, and finding nothing there but static and dust to perk up their senses,'' he said. ''These people need a jolt,'' something ''blatant enough to poke them in the nose.''</p>
        <p>Like onions? More like biscuits, said Ms. Godfrey-June, the beauty director. ''Nobody's doing the smell of bread -- and who isn't craving a carb?''</p>
