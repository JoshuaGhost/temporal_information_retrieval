        <p>So he got sick. He didn't get rich. Richard Reeves writes him off as a failure (''When Charisma Was King''). The real John V. Lindsay outlives his obits. He was special from his earliest days on Long Island, at St. Paul's School, at Yale, in the service, in a young marriage, in Congress, as mayor of New York, as a hero in Harlem. He was extra-special as a Republican, the only one except Roy Goodman most old Democrats ever voted for -- even before he joined us. John Lindsay was a golden boy.</p>
