        <p>Ordinary investors cannot buy shares of hedge funds, but they may soon be able to manage one.</p>
        <p>StockJungle.com, a tiny Los Angeles asset manager, hopes to open its new Hot Hands hedge fund by June. The firm already offers the StockJungle.com Community Intelligence mutual fund, whose managers cull investment ideas from several thousand amateur stock pickers who convene on the site's message board. After a hot start, that $4 million fund finished 2000 down 1.4 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>If the idea of such a fund sounds odd -- and there is no shortage of critics who say it does -- five companies now either offer or plan to offer mutual funds that tap message-board tipsters for investment ideas. The new StockJungle.com fund, however, will be the first such hedge fund, an exclusive product that caters to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>The initial plan is for Hot Hands to be managed by 10 people hired from StockJungle.com's message board, with each manager overseeing $1 million.</p>
        <p>The first hire is Chirag Amin, 28, a part-time orthopedic surgeon and a vice president of Medschool.com, an Internet start-up. Dr. Amin, who invests in the health care industry, calls the opportunity a dream come true.</p>
        <p>''It's very exciting,'' said Dr. Amin, who bought his first stock, Amgen, in 1995, and has since become an avid investor. ''My dream job would be to be a mutual fund manager.'' Such a move, however, would be the opposite of the usual pattern: mutual fund managers tend to leave their jobs for the more lucrative pastures of the hedge fund industry.</p>
