        <p>The floors of the school are stacked on top of one another like four thick slices of bread. When the building collapsed Friday, dozens of the sons and daughters of India's striving middle class were killed, trapped after a powerful earthquake struck this thriving city in western India.</p>
        <p>Rescue workers armed with drills, cranes and bulldozers, but mostly just their bare hands, today continued a desperate effort to save the high school students still buried in the rubble, but all they dragged out were lifeless bodies -- more to add to the thousands found so far across the state of Gujarat.</p>
        <p>[The confirmed number of dead in Gujarat has risen to more than 6,000, police officials told The Associated Press on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>[Battalions of soldiers continued to dig through the ruins of remote villages and towns close to the epicenter, and on Saturday afternoon, rescuers in Bhuj had their first success, pulling two men and a girl alive from the rubble, The A.P. reported.]</p>
        <p>The Indian government's huge relief effort continued today, with helicopters airdropping food, blankets, clothing and medical supplies to areas cut off from roads and railways.</p>
        <p>One hundred forty doctors from New Delhi and other parts of India, who volunteered to help treat an estimated 15,000 injured people, have been flown to the worst-affected areas.</p>
        <p>The devastation from the earthquake -- which India said showed a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 and the United States Geological Survey put at 7.9 -- is gravest around Bhuj, a city of 150,000.</p>
        <p>About 350 people have been confirmed dead in Ahmedabad as of today. In neighboring Pakistan, the quake was reported to have killed 14 people.</p>
        <p>Each individual story of loss has its own poignancy, but the fate of the students at the Swamimarayan school seems especially cruel.</p>
        <p>These teenagers, with their dreams of being doctors, computer scientists and engineers, had come to school on Republic Day, a national holiday when schoolchildren across the country stay home, for an extra science lab.</p>
        <p>About 65 of them showed up Friday at 7:30 a.m. sharp, with their physics instruments and chemistry books. They were in the middle of their lab when the building started shaking violently at 8:46 a.m.</p>
        <p>Pragna Jagdishthandra, a slender 16-year-old talking a mile a minute, was sitting next to the door of her classroom when the earthquake began. She fled for the stairs. A trail of panicked students raced behind her. She made it out just as the four-story school building, less than a year old, crumbled from front to back with a thunderous roar. Others -- she is not sure how many -- escaped as well.</p>
        <p>''But many of the children behind me were trapped,'' she said. ''It was very dusty and I couldn't see. But I clearly heard one girl's voice crying out, and my friend Priyanka was left behind.''</p>
        <p>Friday afternoon, rescuers saved five of the students, who managed to survive because pillars kept the roof from flattening them. ''We heard children crying, 'Please save us,' '' said D. K. Mishra, a doctor with the government's rapid action force, a paramilitary unit for emergencies.</p>
        <p>But the last living child was pulled from the wreckage Friday afternoon. Eight dead students were found Friday, and 20 more today. Officials said there could be 10 more still buried in the rubble.</p>
        <p>Families and friends of the students, and people from the neighborhood, today lined a hot, dusty alley behind the private school. They formed a sorrowful farewell line for the youths carried out on stretchers, their sneaker-clad feet peeking from under the sheets that covered them.</p>
        <p>From the rooftops of surrounding buildings -- which all remained standing -- people watched and wept as volunteers and members of the rapid action force dragged body after body from the school. People lifted the cloths that covered the faces of the students as they passed, to see if they knew the victims.</p>
        <p>M. Jaysukhlalani, an accountant and father of a missing son, waited at the end of the line next to an ambulance. He had been there waiting 29 straight hours for his youngest son. But none of the four dead boys brought out at midafternoon today was his Sunil.</p>
        <p>Like many of the parents here -- and like many residents of Ahmedabad -- he noticed that most of the buildings in the city withstood the earthquake, while isolated ones like his son's school -- more than 100 of them -- simply imploded. And like many others, he believed that shoddy construction was to blame.</p>
        <p>N. B. Parmar, the police inspector in the area, who was supervising the rescue effort, agreed that the building appeared to lack sufficient cement. ''It will be investigated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kirti Gajar, another father, could not bear to watch the parade of the dead. So he and his wife, Meena Ben, stood across the street from the school, clinging to a fast-fading hope that their only son would make it out alive. Like Sunil's father, Mr. Gajar, a civil engineer, spoke knowledgeably and with great composure about what he presumed to be the flaws in the school's construction, particularly what he believes is an overabundance of sand in the concrete.</p>
        <p>''No doubt this earthquake was a natural calamity,'' he said. ''We can expect some damage, but nothing like this.''</p>
        <p>But when the conversation turned to the fate of his son, Mr. Gajar's composure crumbled. His hands shook, his eyes welled with tears. ''I can only know when I see his face if my son is still alive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His wife then stepped beside him. She had been there since the previous morning, unable to sleep, eat or drink. Her face was ravaged by exhaustion and worry. ''How can I eat when my son is not here?'' she asked.</p>

        <p>International Aid Pledged</p>
        <p>NEW DELHI, Jan. 27, (Agence France-Presse) -- International rescue teams were en route to India today to help search for survivors of the devastating earthquake.</p>
        <p>Britain, the former colonial power in India, has a large Indian community and immediately pledged some $4.5 million in aid.</p>
        <p>A 69-member search and rescue team from the International Rescue Corps flew out on a British military airplane to help find survivors. It will be joined by a Swiss team of 45, workers from the Swiss Red Cross, soldiers and members of the emergency services as well as sniffer dogs and 18 tons of rescue equipment and aid materials.</p>
        <p>[Turkey, where more than 15,000 people were killed in an earthquake in August 1999, was sending three search and rescue teams to India, Reuters reported from Ankara].</p>
        <p>The International Federation of the Red Cross said it was preparing to send two mobile clinics -- from Germany and Finland -- to India.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan offered assurances that the United Nations would support relief efforts. The 15-member European Union offered any help needed.</p>
        <p>Germany promised about $1 million in immediate aid. Norway pledged just slightly more, and the Netherlands offered about $420,000.</p>
        <p>Among the first to offer help and condolences was the leader of India's perennial archrival, Pakistan, which offered relief supplies including medicines and equipment. The neighbors have fought three wars since their partition in 1947 and remain deeply at odds over the divided Himalayan state of Kashmir.</p>
        <p>China, with whom India has also quarreled in the past, offered $50,000 through the Red Cross. The United States offered an initial $25,000 and said more would be available if requested.</p>
