        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Cases column ''A No-Drug Approach to Wellness'' (Jan. 23) underscoring the case of Mr. J., who insisted on having his depression treated without psychotropic medication, is highly instructive for a number of reasons.</p>
        <p>The decision of the writer, also a psychiatrist, to respect this patient's autonomy, and see him on his own terms, despite her medical training, which stressed the primacy and necessity of pharmaceutical intervention, speaks to her own flexibility and sensitivity to him.</p>
        <p>It is interesting that in this day and age that there can sometimes be legal consequences for not using drugs to treat depressed patients.</p>
        <p>But we also know that most managed care mental health programs would not have paid for this patient's extended treatment without medication.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many managed care programs allocate sessions in part based on whether the patient is taking medication.</p>
        <p>Those who are taking medication are said to fit better into the guidelines for ''medical necessity,'' which these companies use to decide whether to authorize continuing treatment.</p>
