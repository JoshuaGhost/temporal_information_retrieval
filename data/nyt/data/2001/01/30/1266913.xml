        <p>Picking up where the original left off, the first new edition of ''Survivor'' on CBS Sunday night scored the highest rating of any entertainment show on television in the 2000-2001 television season, trailing only the show it followed, the Super Bowl, as the most-watched show of any kind this season.</p>
        <p>While ''Survivor'' was not the highest-rated show ever to follow a Super Bowl -- trailing an episode of the NBC comedy ''Friends,'' which followed the 1996 Super Bowl and was seen by almost 53 million viewers -- it still attracted an average audience of 43.5 million viewers, down only a bit from the 51 million who watched the finale of ''Survivor'' last summer.</p>

        <p>Picking up where the original left off, the first new edition of ''Survivor'' on CBS Sunday night scored the highest rating of any entertainment show on television in the 2000-2001 television season, trailing only the show it followed, the Super Bowl, as the most-watched show of any kind this season.</p>
        <p>While ''Survivor'' was not the highest-rated show ever to follow a Super Bowl -- trailing an episode of the NBC comedy ''Friends,'' which followed the 1996 Super Bowl and was seen by almost 53 million viewers -- it still attracted an average audience of 43.5 million viewers, down only a bit from the 51 million who watched the finale of ''Survivor'' last summer.</p>
        <p>CBS also noted that while 131.2 million people watched some part of the Super Bowl, 143 million watched some part of the game and ''Survivor'' combined -- meaning that about 12 million viewers skipped the game but tuned in the show. It is rare for any show following the Super Bowl to bring in such a large number of so-called unique viewers.</p>
        <p>The network is hoping that a significant number will want to see the next ''Survivor'' installment on Thursday night, when it settles into its regular time period, facing off against ''Friends'' on NBC at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>CBS also announced yesterday that it would repeat the opening episode of ''Survivor II'' tomorrow night at 8.</p>
        <p>The new ''Survivor'' was again by far the strongest entertainment show on CBS with viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, the group most favored by advertisers. In that group the show scored a 20.8 rating, or 25.9 million viewers. That dwarfed the rating for the first episode of the original last summer, which was a 6.1. The show was even more appealing to men -- probably because of its football lead-in -- than the finale of the original was, though it was not as strong among women.</p>
        <p>''Survivor II'' also scored better with teenagers, perhaps reflecting the teenage following that came to the game because of its MTV-produced halftime show.</p>
        <p>Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, praised the work of the show's executive producer, Mark Burnett, saying, ''He did a spectacular job producing this again.'' Mr. Moonves also said that he was encouraged by the strong showing for the opening episode, and, ''I think it bodes well for us on Thursday.''</p>
