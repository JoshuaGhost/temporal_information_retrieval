        <p>Lombard-Freid Fine Arts</p>
        <p>531 West 26th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>All the artists in this out-of-towner showcase organized by Kerry Inman are represented by the Inman Gallery of Houston, known as a seedbed for young talent. And as the title suggests, much of the work is made of used and castoff materials.</p>
        <p>Bill Davenport is a ringleader here, touching on many formal bases in a still-life painting of vintage paperbacks, a plaster sculpture of a snowman and a child-size pink mitten emblazoned with the word ''go.'' Francesca Fuchs uses ''found'' patterns in her paintings: the horizontal colored stripes on a thermos are turned into a mural. And Brad Tucker does ingenious things with carved skateboards and cut-out foam rubber words. (He is also included in the current ''Some New Minds'' at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens.)</p>
        <p>The real magician of recycling, though, is Dario Robleto, who is represented here by modest pieces, among them a couple of his wry diva homages. One, ''I Wish I Could Give Maria All the Love She Will Ever Need,'' is made of thrift store trophy parts recast from melted Callas recordings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robleto has a mad-scientist's way of mixing music, technology, art history, philosophy and stand-up comedy to create fresh, mutant forms. He recently completed an installation-style project at ArtPace in San Antonio, and judging by photos, it would be the perfect centerpiece for an overdue New York solo.</p>
