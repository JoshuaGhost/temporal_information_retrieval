        <p>CAROLYN PLUM LEROY, 28, descends from a long line of successful entertainers. Her great-grandfather Harry M. Warner was one of the Warner brothers and her grandfather Mervyn LeRoy produced ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Her father, Warner LeRoy, created opulent, knock-your-socks-off spectacles like the Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York, which has curvy mirrored hallways reminiscent of a fun house.</p>
        <p>There was plenty of Ozish fantasy in Ms. LeRoy's childhood. Family parties were populated with stilt walkers and mimes. She lived in the fortresslike Dakota on the Upper West Side, in a bedroom with a balcony where she could sometimes be spotted waving to passers-by in Central Park.</p>

        <p>CAROLYN PLUM LEROY, 28, descends from a long line of successful entertainers. Her great-grandfather Harry M. Warner was one of the Warner brothers and her grandfather Mervyn LeRoy produced ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Her father, Warner LeRoy, created opulent, knock-your-socks-off spectacles like the Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York, which has curvy mirrored hallways reminiscent of a fun house.</p>
        <p>There was plenty of Ozish fantasy in Ms. LeRoy's childhood. Family parties were populated with stilt walkers and mimes. She lived in the fortresslike Dakota on the Upper West Side, in a bedroom with a balcony where she could sometimes be spotted waving to passers-by in Central Park.</p>
        <p>So, when you meet her today, you expect someone dressed flamboyantly, maybe with a parrot or a boa constrictor on her shoulder. But in person she seems more soulful than sensational. Curled up in an armchair a few weeks ago, wearing baggy sweat pants and no makeup, she talked about the importance of quiet time for reading a book, getting a massage or writing down her thoughts.</p>
        <p>''Carolyn stands out because she always manages to keep her head,'' said Bridget LeRoy, her stepsister. ''Our family has a tendency to make melodrama out of molehills. And Carolyn is our touchstone. She grounds us.''</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Ms. LeRoy started helping out  her father at Tavern on the Green and soon became known among the staff as the kindhearted daughter of the boss who sometimes tied a scarf around her ankle to hide her unbusinesslike fish tattoo. The scarf charmed Stephen John Moise, then the executive sous-chef. Mr. Moise, 39, grew up in Santa Cruz, Calif., wears his long hair in a braid and also believes in the importance of massages, country walks and quiet contemplation.</p>
        <p>Since hanging out with the boss's daughter is taboo for a chef, he befriended her gingerly, sometimes sneaking up the staircase to her office with omelets, soups and advice about life. ''He was so friendly and a great listener,'' she remembered. ''My dad was fighting cancer and my parents were going through a divorce, and he was the most nonjudgmental person. He only saw the good in me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. LeRoy said it was Mr. Moise's sensitive, nurturing personality -- his tendency to bring her delicious things on trays and to look out for her in general -- that won her heart.</p>
        <p>''The day I fell in love with him, we were in a movie theater in the winter and I was so cold,'' she recalled. ''He said, 'I'll be right back,' and he went out to the car and got a big furry blanket and threw it over us and we watched the movie.''</p>
        <p>Their Jan. 7 wedding at Tavern on the Green was a perfect balance between down-to-earth and ethereal, homey and showy. They were married in the Crystal Room under the chandeliers that rain down like fireworks, surrounded by tall, ornate sculptures made for the wedding out of leaves, flowers, pine cones and vines, all spray-painted glittery silver and hung with crystal snowflakes and icicles. The 200 guests, who included Kurt Vonnegut and Jill Krementz, Nora Ephron and Nick Pileggi, Mick Jones and Ann Dexter-Jones, and Lauren Bacall, looked out onto a garden decorated with ice sculptures, one of which was a playhouse-size palace illuminated with Windex-blue lights.</p>
        <p>Yet, the ceremony itself was more thoughtful than fanciful. The couple, who no longer work at Tavern on the Green and are contemplating their next career moves, wrote the entire script and filled it with poetry, an Apache wedding prayer, heartfelt promises and musings on marriage and their future. They were neither brief nor hurried.</p>
        <p>''I imagine my dad told her, 'Hey, it's too long, you've got to keep it like a Warner Brothers movie, you've got to keep your audience captivated,' '' Bridget LeRoy said. ''But Carolyn had the strength and courage to say everything she wanted to say.''</p>
