        <p>The new and explosive dance scene in Japan has spawned four more provocative and uninhibited companies, all introduced on Saturday night by the Japanese Contemporary Dance Showcase.</p>
        <p>This selective overview of experimental work has become an annual, even festive, event at Japan Society. The latest version was wacky, weird and serious, never short on vivid images.</p>
        <p>Among them were a spaceman in a pink plastic suit, disintegrating before his rebirth; serene dancers using martial arts to jab dangerously at their partners; an exuberant tribe of female gymnasts in various rope tricks; and a study in relationships built around a deconstructed embrace.</p>
        <p>As usual, the groups were selected by Mayumi Nagatoshi, an enterprising promoter of experimental dance and president of AN Creative Inc. in Tokyo. Thanks to her, H. Art Chaos, the sensation of the Joyce Theater season last year, had its initial exposure in New York through this showcase.</p>
        <p>A packed house, which included Edward Albee, was on hand on Saturday, perhaps looking for another H. Art Chaos. The four groups were different from one another, yet like that company they had an aggressive or exuberant tone and implied a critique of post-industrial society. Loud sound seemed a requirement.</p>
        <p>It was also clear that experimental dance in Japan no longer looks like a copy of Merce Cunningham's work or the homegrown expressive genre known as Butoh. These influences could still be traced in formal and nonlinear structures as well as in the Butoh training of some choreographers.</p>
        <p>But the emphasis today is on discovering new ways of movement and expression. In two of the groups on Saturday's program, nondance movement was transformed into a dance idiom.</p>
        <p>Akiko Kitamura, who leads the Leni-Basso company, was at her best when she stylized martial arts into dramatic encounters. But CAGR, headed by Kumi Wakaida, needs to go beyond an artistic gymnastic display, ropes and all, though it was a crowd pleaser. (Admittedly, only an excerpt was presented Saturday.)</p>
        <p>Ken'ichi Tanno's Numbering Machine and Kim Itoh's company, the Glorious Future, were more impressive, not because they looked dancelike but because they were more secure in their material.</p>
        <p>Essentially, all these works are dances of extreme synthesis, heralded by Saburo Teshigawara, whose Karas company appeared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music 10 years ago and who needs to be invited back.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tanno is closest to Karas in that he hints at a spiritual rebirth after a body empties itself of negativity. In a powerful solo, ''011-DOT,'' he starts out in a pink parody of a uniform or spacesuit, his mouth and eyes rimmed in black. Rooted to the spot, as he slaps his body to a disco beat provided by Jiro Matsumoto, he twitches more violently against three or sometimes two of his own shadows.</p>
        <p>To call him a robot would be too simple, and his expressive grimaces and abstract gestures hint at the human inside the futuristic figure. Suddenly, a film displays a flattened abstraction of him from which little pink figures tumble forth until the last shatters into pieces.</p>
        <p>In the second half, ''012-RAG,'' Mr. Matsumoto's amplified guitar emits waves of sound as Mr. Tanno, in a tattered burlap outfit, hair gray, looking increasingly spent, staggers through a desert of desolation, on a diagonal. The Butoh cycle of catastrophe and rebirth has been ingeniously restated in new terms.</p>
        <p>In a shortened version of ''I Want to Hold You,'' Mr. Itoh starts out in a nicely disjointed solo under a bright lamp. He hugs himself with one arm and pushes it away. Later four men will push four women away from an embrace and then carry them routinely as if performing chores.</p>
        <p>Movement seen in new context is part of a careful structure here. Three women sit in a diagonal and stretch an arm. When another woman does the same, her gesture pushes her partner away. At the end, however, she tightens his embrace.</p>
        <p>The music, from pop to Arvo Part, includes the sound of rushing water and again an image of robotic figures. They recur as well in CAGR (Choreography Art Gymnastics Rockets), which performed an excerpt from Ms. Wakaida's ''Opera de Circus,'' including a slyly erotic beach ball number.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kitamura has more to say in her idiom than in her video images in ''dred: hyperbolic zone,'' despite images of trains and cities that speak of alienation. As instructions for martial arts are heard on tape or seen on a screen, the dancers amazingly remain close to elbows and arms that swipe repeatedly at their faces. The idiom is fluid, transformed remarkably into something different from its origins.</p>
