        <p>Frederick Drimmer, who wrote and edited books that explored both the painful and the macabre, died on Dec. 24 in Norwalk, Conn. He was 83 and lived in Norwalk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drimmer was the editor of the book ''Scalps and Tomahawks: Narratives of Indian Captivity'' (1961). Reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, John C. Ewers, an ethnologist, wrote: ''American literature may contain no more shocking passage than Dr. John Knight's description of the slow burning to death at the stake of George Washington's friend Col. William Crawford by the Shawnees in 1782, during which the redskins threw the Colonel's bloody scalp in Knight's face, shouting, 'That is your captain.' ''</p>

        <p>Frederick Drimmer, who wrote and edited books that explored both the painful and the macabre, died on Dec. 24 in Norwalk, Conn. He was 83 and lived in Norwalk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drimmer was the editor of the book ''Scalps and Tomahawks: Narratives of Indian Captivity'' (1961). Reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, John C. Ewers, an ethnologist, wrote: ''American literature may contain no more shocking passage than Dr. John Knight's description of the slow burning to death at the stake of George Washington's friend Col. William Crawford by the Shawnees in 1782, during which the redskins threw the Colonel's bloody scalp in Knight's face, shouting, 'That is your captain.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ewers observed, ''The gruesome picture of man's inhumanity to man on the Indian frontier would have been portrayed more fairly'' had Mr. Drimmer ''added one or more of the deliberate massacres of Indians by the whites'' to that book.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drimmer recalled, in writing about his book ''Body Snatchers, Stiffs, and Other Ghoulish Delights'' (1981, Carol), that he had met a showman in North Carolina who ''owned two dead bodies that he exhibited around the country, and he suggested there would be considerable interest in a book about 'stiffs,' as he called them.' ''</p>
        <p>Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Drimmer received a bachelor's degree from City College and a master's degree from Columbia. He was in the Navy during World War II.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Evelyn; a son, John, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a daughter, Jean Iaderosa of Savannah, Ga.; and two grandchildren.</p>
