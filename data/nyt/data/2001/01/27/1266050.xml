        <p>Jets Coach Herman Edwards said today that he would take a look at several Tampa Bay Buccaneers who are scheduled to become free agents in March, among them cornerback Ronde Barber, the twin of Giants running back Tiki Barber.</p>
        <p>Edwards, who was a Tampa Bay assistant until he was hired by the Jets, was in town to clean out his office at the Buccaneers' complex, and he met with several of his former players. It was Edwards's first time back since he was named the Jets' coach on Jan. 18.</p>

        <p>Jets Coach Herman Edwards said today that he would take a look at several Tampa Bay Buccaneers who are scheduled to become free agents in March, among them cornerback Ronde Barber, the twin of Giants running back Tiki Barber.</p>
        <p>Edwards, who was a Tampa Bay assistant until he was hired by the Jets, was in town to clean out his office at the Buccaneers' complex, and he met with several of his former players. It was Edwards's first time back since he was named the Jets' coach on Jan. 18.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of guys I've grown with as a coach,'' Edwards said. ''Some of those guys' contracts are up. That's the great thing about free agency. They might want to come up and see what New York looks like, and if they do, I might pick them up.''</p>
        <p>Edwards will resume interviewing candidates for his staff Wednesday in New York. The Jets are scheduled to interview several members of the Buffalo defensive staff; they would join the defensive coordinator, Ted Cottrell, who was hired this week from Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Edwards said he had not yet talked to Jets linebacker Bryan Cox about returning to the team. Cox has a clause in his contract that essentially allows him to leave the Jets if he chooses to before March.</p>
