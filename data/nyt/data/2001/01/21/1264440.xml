        <p>Bearak presents an unbiased view of the situation in Kashmir. However, as an Indian, I would like to mention that it is difficult for a foreigner to understand the subtleties of language and culture, which can be helpful in conveying information. Had he understood Hindi/Punjabi, and been slightly more informed about the native culture, his meeting with the Sikh businessman and his conversations with Suhail Malik might have been more fruitful. Nonetheless, this is the most extensive and thorough report about the incident that I have read.</p>
