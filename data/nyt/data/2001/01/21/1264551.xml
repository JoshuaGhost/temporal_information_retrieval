        <p>WHEN Jon Faddis, the trumpeter who is now the artist-in-residence at Purchase College's jazz studies program, was 12, his parents took him to a supper club in San Francisco so he could hear his musical idol, Dizzy Gillespie, perform.</p>
        <p>After the show, Mr. Faddis said, he was introduced to the legendary trumpeter and band leader, ''but I was too shy to say anything to him.''</p>
        <p>''So I promised myself the next time I met Dizzy I would talk to him -- and I did,'' Mr. Faddis continued. ''I was 15, and it was at the Monterey Jazz Festival. After he played we talked quite a bit. I'd also brought all of his records that I owned with me and he autographed each one.''</p>
        <p>Next Saturday night Mr. Faddis, now 47, will have another chance to pay homage to the musician who became his mentor, in a concert titled ''Big Band Bop: The Music of Dizzy Gillespie'' at PepsiCo Theater at Purchase College.</p>
        <p>''This concert is special to me for lots of reasons,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''We'll be playing music that I grew up listening to every day, and with Dizzy passed away [Gillespie died in 1993] I feel it's important to continue his musical legacy.''</p>
        <p>Joining Mr. Faddis, who also plays the flugelhorn, will be several notable jazz musicians, including two saxophonists, Frank Wess and Ralph Lalama, who are equally adept on the flute; the trombonist Conrad Herwig; the bassist Todd Coolman, a fellow Purchase College educator; and the baritone saxophonist Gary Smuylan, a Hastings-on-Hudson resident.</p>
        <p>Much of the Purchase College concert will focus on material written by Gillespie for his jazz orchestra of the late 1940's -- ''songs like 'Woody 'n You' and 'Things to Come,' which aren't heard much anymore,'' Mr. Faddis said.</p>
        <p>''Dizzy possessed this wonderful combination of musicianship and humor, and that's what made him a great entertainer,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''When he played, people would have so much fun that they tended to overlook the musical aspects of his performance, and I can tell you -- he was very serious about music.</p>
        <p>''The best thing about Dizzy, though, was he was always willing to help other musicians; he was always ready to talk about music. You could call him up at 2:30 in the morning and tell him you were having trouble with one part or another of a certain song and he'd spend the next 40 minutes explaining it to you.</p>
        <p>''I first played with Dizzy when I was 15, and my dad said that I walked on air for the next six months,'' Mr. Faddis said. ''From that point on I knew that I wanted to be a musician.'' Gillespie was always ''very supportive of me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1971, just barely out of high school, Mr. Faddis, a native of Oakland, Calif., moved to New York. Gillespie was there to help and, as a result, making it in the city's competitive jazz scene ''came pretty easy to me, not that I didn't experience some tough times,'' said Mr. Faddis, who also credited two other trumpeters, Clark Terry and Lew Soloff, for watching out for him early on. ''All in all, it was a good time to be in New York City. Duke Ellington was still around, and guys I grew up admiring, like Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw, were also playing in town a lot.''</p>
        <p>From the start Mr. Faddis found loads of people to perform with. In the 1970's and 80's he worked regularly in the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra while also appearing on albums led by a who's who of jazz greats, including Oscar Peterson, Milt Hinton, McCoy Tyner, Anthony Braxton and Charles Mingus.</p>
        <p>Over the years Mr. Faddis has amassed an impressive discography of his own works: his most recent CD, a recording with the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All Stars, was released on the Shanachie Entertainment label last year.</p>
        <p>In 1993 Mr. Faddis became musical director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra and has been leading the ensemble ever since.</p>
        <p>Before his appointment at Purchase College two years ago Mr. Faddis, who lives in northern New Jersey, had taught privately and done workshops but had never had full classroom responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Besides teaching two classes a semester, both for fairly advanced students, Mr. Faddis also organizes a pair of concerts for the college each term. In May he will present another tribute, this time to the collaborations of Miles Davis and Gil Evans. And last week Mr. Faddis performed with other Purchase faculty members at the International Association of Jazz Educators conference in New York City.</p>
        <p>''I think the students I'm in contact with at Purchase are impressed and  excited about having someone there who has played with a lot of their  heroes,'' Mr. Faddis said, ''and beyond what I can do for them academically or in terms of helping them develop their musical styles, my main objective, I feel, is to inspire them and prepare them for the real world. A lot of what they need to know, especially in this music we call jazz, is not something they will learn in a classroom, though. They'll just have to go out and blow, test their chops, and see what they can do.''</p>
        <p>His reason?</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to keep this great music alive,'' said Mr. Faddis, modestly.</p>
        <p>Jon Faddis and the New York Big Band All Stars will perform ''Big Band Bop: The Music of Dizzy Gillespie'' at 8 p.m. on Jan. 27 at the PepsiCo Theater on the grounds of Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase. Tickets are $37 and $32. Tickets and information: call (914) 251-6200 or visit the Web site  www.artcenter.org.</p>
