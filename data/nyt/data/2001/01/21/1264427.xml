        <p>IT had been 24 years since my family left the remote South Pacific islands of American Samoa, where I spent much of my childhood. But as I packed for my first trip back as an adult, I realized that I didn't feel the excited anticipation that usually accompanies a long-awaited vacation.</p>
        <p>Instead, I was nervous about returning to the place that I loved so much as a child and young teenager -- hesitant to disturb memories of idyllic days spent exploring unspoiled  reefs and beaches, hiking through the rain forests to waterfalls and never having to wear real shoes.</p>

        <p>IT had been 24 years since my family left the remote South Pacific islands of American Samoa, where I spent much of my childhood. But as I packed for my first trip back as an adult, I realized that I didn't feel the excited anticipation that usually accompanies a long-awaited vacation.</p>
        <p>Instead, I was nervous about returning to the place that I loved so much as a child and young teenager -- hesitant to disturb memories of idyllic days spent exploring unspoiled  reefs and beaches, hiking through the rain forests to waterfalls and never having to wear real shoes.</p>
        <p>Of course, it was never that perfect. My brother, sister and I certainly gave my father plenty of grief after he uprooted us during our elementary-school years in Michigan. He took a job with the federally financed television station that was developed there to broadcast lessons to village schools around the island. But did I really want to remember the downside of spending seven years in the middle of nowhere? Having to order basics from the Sears catalog. The simple houses with nothing but screens for outside walls. The stifling humidity, the cockroaches, geckoes and toads. And, of course, the lack of simple childhood pleasures like McDonald's.</p>
        <p>Now, I only hoped that there was still no McDonald's.</p>
        <p>My nerves started to calm at the Honolulu airport. Standing in line to check in for the twice-a-week, five-hour flight south to Pago Pago, I suddenly felt at home with the crowd of Samoans, many of whom, like my husband, Roberto, and I, along with my parents, sister and her husband, had planned their trips home to coincide with the annual Flag Day celebration in April. The millennium year was also the centennial of the small group of islands' becoming an American territory, and a weeklong festival of traditional singing, dancing and celebrating was planned. It would be capped off with the annual fautasi (longboat) races -- a high-stakes rowing competition among villages.</p>
        <p>So I settled in for the flight, comfortable now and finally excited. When we landed, it was dark and I couldn't see Matafao, the 2,142-foot mountain that looks like the profile of a sleeping lady towering in the background. But I hoped that after more than two decades, things hadn't really changed.</p>
        <p>In the heart of Polynesia, a little more than halfway from Hawaii to New Zealand, the islands of American Samoa are widely described as among the most beautiful in the South Pacific. Five rugged volcanic islands and two coral atolls make a total land mass of 76 square miles. The mountainous volcanic islands combine rain forests, sandy beaches and steep sea cliffs, fringed by  coral reefs.</p>
        <p>Although the population has doubled, to more than 60,000, since I lived there, by and large American Samoa's beauty remains unspoiled. There are many more modern homes and stores, and the two-lane main road that runs through a half-dozen villages and along the coast from the airport into Pago Pago, on the main island of Tutuila, is crowded with big American sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a steady infusion of federal dollars supporting the territory, American Samoans have been able to enjoy a Western standard of living without depending on tourism. Besides government jobs, the only real source of work on the island is tuna fishing and canning. Tourism has apparently decreased over the last 24 years, which seems to be a blessing and a curse. The downside (which became apparent on a side trip to the much poorer, independent sister islands of Western Samoa) is that the islanders seem to take a certain comfort level for granted, even though the infrastructure needs more attention.</p>
        <p>Government buildings, like the television station, are run-down. The old cable car that used to take workers 6,000 feet across the harbor to the television transmitters on Mount Alava sits rusted out at the abandoned station, surrounded by broken beer bottles. Tutuila was spotless for Flag Day, but by the time we left, soda cans and other litter were reappearing along the roadways.</p>
        <p>The flip side is that Tutuila, only about 30 miles long and 6 miles wide at its widest point, remains bordered by spectacular undeveloped palm-lined beaches and coves, mountainous rain forests and a remote national park on the north side of the island that for years was almost inaccessible. But it is not an island for the unadventurous tourist.</p>
        <p>There is only one resort-style hotel on the island, with a beach and a pool. The 182-room Rainmaker, which overlooks the five-mile-long mountain-lined harbor, suffers from years of neglect. In fact, my sister and I were convinced that broken-down wooden lounge chairs by the pool were the same ones that were there in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>There are several small inns and bed-and-breakfasts. Our friends on the island recommend the Tessarea Vaitogi Inn in Vaitogi, a village about 30 minutes from Pago Pago that is best known for its cliffside site overlooking the sea. According to Samoan legend, during a famine a grandmother and her granddaughter leaped into the sea to avoid starvation and turned into a turtle and shark. When village children gather at the side of the cliff and sing, a turtle and shark can sometimes be spotted.</p>
        <p>But to see such places, you have to rent a car and explore. There really aren't any tour buses or organized hiking or snorkeling. During our two-week trip, we stayed in the house belonging to the son of my parents' friends. And as my parents and I ventured out to show the island to my husband, Roberto, it became clear how hard it would be to explore it cold, not knowing  which of the dirt roads or paths would take us to a deserted beach, or up the mountain to a waterfall in the rain forest.</p>
        <p>It wasn't hard to find a guide, though. Islanders, particularly those who had migrated from the mainland United States (or palagis), love to show off their little paradise. Just stop at the Pago Pago Yacht Club, a rundown bar on the beach in Utulei, five  minutes east of Pago Pago. Want to scuba dive? They know the guys with equipment. Want to windsurf? They can tell you where to get the gear. Want to hike to remote beaches on otherwise unreachable areas on the stunning north side of the island? Well, then talk to John Wasko and John Goecke, known islandwide for their adventures and misadventures in Tutuila's mountainous rain forests. I had connected with John Wasko on the Internet, and this amiable former Peace Corps member, now a local businessman married to a Samoan, became a new friend.</p>
        <p>We were staying in the village of Aoloau, which is on the west side of the island along a road up the 1,340-foot mountain called Aoloaufou. Roberto and I and my sister and her husband hopped into the back of the two Johns' pickup to ride to the top of the mountain that overlooks the airport in Tafuna and a beautiful peninsula called Coconut Point.</p>
        <p>There were a few houses at the end of the road. We knocked on one door. A few words of Samoan were exchanged and the man who lived there led us through his taro patch to a barely discernible thin path. We followed the steep, sometimes slippery trail for a few hours, ending up at a lovely cove; on one side, a freshwater pool drained into a waterfall that flowed into the sea.</p>
        <p>Topping Mr. Wasko's agenda for us was taking a practice run on the Satani fautasi, the champion longboat from the village of Nuuuli. The Satani crew would be defending its title, a championship that carries a prize of more than $50,000. Watching the fautasi races had always been a great pleasure for me as a child. The boats are 92-foot-long  wooden canoes, barely wide enough to seat two men on each bench. They look like huge caterpillars gliding through Tutuila's harbor, one of the largest natural harbors in the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>The rowers seemed a bit hesitant when they learned that Mr. Wasko had arranged with the village chief for Roberto and me to join them. And we began to realize how rare a privilege this was. The races are an almost sacred event, taken so seriously that in the weeks leading up to Flag Day the rowers don't go home. They sleep together on mats in the village fale, an open-air thatched-roof meeting place that is the center of each village.</p>
        <p>Aware of the tension, I tried to climb into the back of the boat with the least amount of disruption. Roberto and I teetered precariously on the edge, just a few inches out of the water, as the team of 45 rowed out to the open ocean.</p>
        <p>Ben, the captain, stood at the front, directing the operation like an orchestra conductor. As we reached the open ocean at the mouth of the bay, I began to worry. Then we stopped. The rower in front of me turned around, shot me a mischievous grin and said, ''Hold on.''</p>
        <p>With the precision of the top-notch athletes they are, the rowers moved  into high gear. The boat took off and began gliding, almost flying, along the five-mile length of the bay. The only sounds were Ben's whistle, the rowers counting quietly to keep time and a soft splash each time all 90 oars hit the water at exactly the same moment.</p>
        <p>As we passed several other boats practicing at racing speed, I knew why this team was the champion. I couldn't wait for the Flag Day races and the chance to brag about riding with the winners.</p>
        <p>But before that, we had a lot of  visiting and exploring to do.</p>
        <p>The first few days it rained a lot, so we drove around the island to see new and old sites. When the sun returned, we spent a few days exploring favorite beaches and snorkeling.</p>
        <p>We also saw the national park, which opened in 1993, on the north side of the island. It's about a 40-minute drive from Pago, and from the road you can see spectacular sea cliffs, remote beaches and rain forest. The road ends at the village of Vatia, a small community that now has a mix of modern and traditional fales that overlook a beautiful bay. Just offshore is Pola Island, a rock formation commonly referred to as the Cockscomb.</p>
        <p>April 17, Flag Day, is the start of more than a week of centennial festivities. For the big parade, a Navy ship and crew arrived to participate in traditional ceremonies and join schoolchildren, police officers and every kind of group imaginable marching in the parade. And nearly every one of the dozens of villages throughout the islands performed traditional dances and songs.</p>
        <p>Another day, I took a short hike to Black Falls, a waterfall and pool on a mountainside where we used to hang out as teenagers. Though houses are slowly being built closer to the stream and waterfall, I still had the place to myself.</p>
        <p>Despite the festival and all my memories to chase, the island gets small fast; Roberto and I wanted to take a side trip away from the family. We tried to go to Ofu, one of the smaller islands about a 15-minute flight away, where a remote national park has been developed on a sandy cliff-lined beach. But flights were full.</p>
        <p>So we went to Apia, the capital of Western Samoa, on the island of Upolu. Less than 60 miles away, Western Samoa is a quick trip on a small airplane that offers spectacular views of the mountains and uninhabited areas of Tutuila. As soon as we landed the difference in the two Samoas was apparent. Independent Western Samoa is much larger, with a land area of about 1,097 square miles, most of which are on the two main islands of Upolu and Savaii. The people of Western Samoa, population 190,000, are poorer, but the island is spotless and the simplest houses and traditional fales are in immaculate condition.</p>
        <p>Even downtown Apia seemed little changed from more than 20 years ago. The historic Aggie Grey's Hotel, built in 1933 and made famous as a club for servicemen during World War II, has been kept in remarkable condition. It's clean and comfortable, not luxurious, offering rooms, bungalows and a regular show by the staff of traditional Polynesian and Samoan dancing.</p>
        <p>Not far from Apia (about a 20-minute ride) is Vailima, where Robert Louis Stevenson spent the last years of his life and where he is  buried. His house is now a museum,  and you can hike up a nearby mountain to his gravesite, although we didn't go to Vailima on this trip.</p>
        <p>We had decided to spend two nights at Coconuts, a small resort with a nice mix of Samoan-style fales and the luxury of big beds, air-conditioning and showers styled as lava-rock waterfalls. There is a gecko-shaped pool overlooking the pristine beach, where you can snorkel or kayak. We were lazy, enjoying the chance to just lie around and eat the good food offered in the small restaurant.</p>
        <p>After two days of relaxing we headed back to Pago Pago for the finale of Flag Day and the big fautasi race. The preliminaries had been held earlier in the week. The five best teams were to race from the mouth of the harbor into shore on Good Friday. The trade winds had just kicked in, so the sea was rough out where the boats gathered at the starting line. From the hotel pool overlooking the harbor, we were watching for the first of the barely visible boats to race into the harbor when the news came over the radio: the Satani had been swamped near the starting line. So instead of watching my team glide to victory, I watched a tug tow the capsized boat and its dejected crew to shore. The Fealofani from the village of Fagasa  came racing in, easily defeating the three remaining contenders.</p>
        <p>It was a disappointing end to a fabulous trip, but not as disappointing as seeing the sign on the way  to the airport: ''Coming soon, McDonald's.''</p>
        <p>Where a fast longboat is the way to go</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>There are two weekly flights from Honolulu on Hawaiian Air to American Samoa. There are also flights from Los Angeles to Apia, Western Samoa, and almost hourly service between Apia and Pago Pago that cost about $100 round trip.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay and Eat</p>
        <p>AMERICAN SAMOA: The Rainmaker, Box 996, Pago Pago, American Samoa, 96799, (684) 633-4241, fax (684) 633-5959, is the only resort-style hotel with a private beach and swimming pool. Centrally situated on Pago Pago's harbor but old and run-down, the Rainmaker has 182 air-conditioned rooms and several beach fales. Rates: $60 to $150 a night.</p>
        <p>The Tessarea Vaitogi Inn, in the village of Vaitogi, (684) 699-7793, fax (684) 699-7790, is a small inn with eight rooms and five apartments; all are clean and well furnished. The village is about 30 to 40 minutes from Pago Pago. Rates start at about $100 a night, with Continental breakfast.</p>
        <p>Tisa's Barefoot Bar, (684)-622-7447, is a pleasant outdoor bar on the beautiful, more remote eastern end of the island. It's an outdoor bar and restaurant on one of the island's few private beaches (no admission fee). It is especially busy on Sunday, when many villages prohibit swimming, and is popular among transplanted mainlanders wishing to wear bikinis, which are often frowned upon at public village beaches. If you call in advance for dinner, Tisa Fa'Amuli will prepare fresh fish with vegetables like breadfruit and squash from her family's plantation. Dinner is about $20 a person, plus drinks or dessert.</p>
        <p>WESTERN SAMOA: Coconuts Beach Resort, Box 3684, Apia, Samoa, (685) 24849, fax (685) 20071, www  .coconutsbeachclubsamoa.com, is a quiet beach-side resort on Upolu, over the mountains from downtown Apia. There are 15 regular rooms and 9 private comfortable bungalows built in the style of traditional beach fales but with privacy and air-conditioning, including two that are built out over the ocean with glass floors. Rates: $100 to $300 a night. Amenities include snorkeling, kayaking, a gecko-shaped pool, and a restaurant with wonderful fresh fish. The speciality is fish in a light coconut cream, topped with fresh pineapple and toasted coconut, served with vegetables and a starch ($12.95). For lunch, a delicious curried chicken salad in a papaya half is $7.50.</p>
        <p>Aggie Grey's, Post Office Box 67, Apia, Samoa, (685) 22880, fax (685) 23626, www.aggiegreys.com, is in downtown Apia, near shopping. The hotel was made famous as a favorite of servicemen during World War II. It is in immaculate condition and has 158 rooms and suites and 26 private fales. Doubles: $100 to $220. Excellent food is served at its poolside restaurant. Traditional Samoan dances are performed by the staff.</p>
        <p>Getting Around</p>
        <p>To really explore the islands of Samoa, rent a car. There are several places to rent at the airport on Tutuila. We reserved a car through Avis, (800) 331-1212 (about $50 a day). So-called aiga (family) buses run on most of the islands's main roads day and night. You just flag one down, but they often are very hot and crowded. There is little organized sightseeing. The day we tried to visit the tourism office, (684) 633-1092, on the Web at www.samoanet.com/ americansamoa, it was locked up. There were no brochures at the Rainmaker. We found scuba diving and fishing boats by just asking around at the Pago Pago Yacht Club in Utulei or at inns.</p>
        <p>Cabs are fairly inexpensive on Western Samoa, and the drivers give tours for a negotiated price. Again, aiga buses are everywhere.</p>
