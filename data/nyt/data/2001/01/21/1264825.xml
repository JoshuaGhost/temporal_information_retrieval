        <p>ESPOSITO-Mario J., Honorable. The officers, directors and staff of the American Parkinson Disease Association, Inc. (APDA) mourn the passing of the Honorable Mario J. Esposito on January 17, 2001. For much of his adult life, Mr. Esposito worked tirelessly and without recompense to find a cure for Parkinson's disease. Prior to his presidency of the APDA from 1988 to 1994, he was Sr. Vice President of the organization for 23 years. He was responsible, in part, for making the APDA the only grassroots Parkinson organization in the United States, a vision he shared with his entire family. The Hon. Mario J. Esposito served as County Clerk of Richmond, Staten Island, Clerk of the Supreme Court, Commissioner of Jurors and Registrar for Richmond County. A prominent Roman Catholic layman, Mr. Esposito was a member of the Association of Master Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Association of Knights and Ladies of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Jean, two sons, Mario J. Jr. and Michael; his sister Sophia Maestrone; his brother Salvatore and the entire Esposito family. John Pillarella, President Joel Gerstel, Exec. Director</p>
