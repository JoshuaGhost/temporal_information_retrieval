        <p>The myth of easy e-commerce money has been all but dispelled by now -- even Web giants like Amazon.com are still struggling to turn a profit -- but Rita Roberts Hill and her husband Lee Hill have found a way to make the Web work for them: they didn't quit their day jobs.</p>
        <p>On weekdays, Mrs. Hill works as a marketing executive for a Time Warner  subsidiary and Mr. Hill works as a graphic designer. In the evening and on weekends, however, they work together on Fine African Art (www.fineafricanart.net), an online gallery of Mrs. Hill's collection of traditional African art.</p>

        <p>The myth of easy e-commerce money has been all but dispelled by now -- even Web giants like Amazon.com are still struggling to turn a profit -- but Rita Roberts Hill and her husband Lee Hill have found a way to make the Web work for them: they didn't quit their day jobs.</p>
        <p>On weekdays, Mrs. Hill works as a marketing executive for a Time Warner  subsidiary and Mr. Hill works as a graphic designer. In the evening and on weekends, however, they work together on Fine African Art (www.fineafricanart.net), an online gallery of Mrs. Hill's collection of traditional African art.</p>
        <p>From a home office/gallery in Mount Vernon, the couple use their respective expertise to run the company. Ms. Hill, who studied art in Ghana and has been a collector for more than 15 years, researches and buys art from importers. Mr. Hill designed, programmed and maintains the Web site.</p>
        <p>Because they have no employees, their business has virtually no overhead. So when they sell, for instance, a wooden Pongue Mask from the Congo ($125), the profit is all their's. That's a business model Amazon could learn from.</p>
