        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Peter Applebome's Jan. 7 column ''Repent, Commuters!'' In the days before smoking was banned completely from all Metro-North trains, it was permitted only in one or two designated cars per train.

        <p>Make one or two cars on each train those in which the use of cell phones is permissible. Cell phones would not be allowed in all other cars.</p>
        <p>If this were instituted, the majority of passengers would be spared the annoyance of listening to the conversations of those who seem compelled to be in communication with someone at all times. Perhaps, when they would be required to listen to all the other inane conversations being conducted, the cell phone addicts would appreciate what an intrusion they create.</p>
