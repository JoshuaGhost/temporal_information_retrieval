        <p>The Irish real estate group bidding for the beleaguered Millennium Dome in London has hit a snag in negotiations with the British government over a profit-sharing proposal, people close to the talks say.</p>
        <p>The group, called Legacy, has bid $:125 million ($184 million) to turn the site -- which cost $:850 million ($1.25 billion) to build -- into a high-tech business park.</p>
        <p>The possibility of profit sharing is a new topic, introduced this week. Only a flat price was discussed before. Negotiations are expected to be complete by early February.</p>
        <p>Legacy became a preferred bidder after negotiations with Nomura International, the Japanese bank, fell through in September.</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of Legacy is owned by Treasury Holdings, which is based in Dublin. Richard Barrett and Johnny Ronan, who head Treasury, have come under intense scrutiny in the British media as a result of the bid. ''They've been quite taken aback by the personal nature of the attacks,'' said Sean O'Riordain, a spokesman for Treasury.</p>
        <p>With property assets worth 1 billion Irish pounds ($1.2 billion), Treasury is the largest commercial property developer in Ireland. Its backers include Deutsche Bank and GE Capital. But the Dome would be its biggest project by far. British analysts have questioned whether Treasury will be able to manage the site.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Dome closed as an educational theme park after just one year of operation. It is considered a significant failure for the Labor Party government of Tony Blair, which promoted and subsidized the Dome.</p>
