        <p>Gumbels Rumble In the Courtroom</p>
        <p>BRYANT GUMBEL and his estranged wife, JUNE, were in court again yesterday in White Plains and the judge turned down her lawyer's request to have Mr. Gumbel pay $250,000 for his fees.</p>

        <p>Gumbels Rumble In the Courtroom</p>
        <p>BRYANT GUMBEL and his estranged wife, JUNE, were in court again yesterday in White Plains and the judge turned down her lawyer's request to have Mr. Gumbel pay $250,000 for his fees.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, BARRY SLOTNICK of Manhattan, has already been paid $75,000 under a court order issued last year. This time, Justice MARK C. DILLON of the State Supreme Court turned down Mr. Slotnick's motion for another payment but told him that he could file a motion when the case is over.</p>
        <p>Justice Dillon told Mr. Gumbel -- who has been paying Mrs. Gumbel $18,000 a month -- to pay about $15,000 worth of expenses, including bills from her doctors and from contractors who had done repair work at a home the Gumbels own in Waccabuc, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''This was about a lot of petty little things, disputes between the parties as to when certain things should be paid, whether she was charging things just to be petty as opposed to the reality of needing them,'' said a lawyer for Mr. Gumbel, STANLEY S. ARKIN.</p>
        <p>As for the grounds for divorce, ''We have conceded that there was adultery,'' Mr. Arkin said. ''She's entitled to a divorce, and we would give her a divorce yesterday.''</p>
        <p>But the two sides have financial matters to settle. Mr. Slotnick said after the hearing that he had estimated Mr. Gumbel's net worth to be $21 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arkin countered, ''It's none of the public's business what it is.''</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, It's 'Ralph Who?'</p>
        <p>There has been no shortage of witnesses testifying against JOHN ASHCROFT, President Bush's nominee for attorney general. But the Democrats appear to be shunning one of his critics: RALPH NADER.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader says that he wrote to Senator PATRICK J. LEAHY of Vermont, then the  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, two weeks ago to ask to testify against Mr. Ashcroft. He said that he never heard back.</p>
        <p>''There's some pretty foolish ostracism going on,'' said Mr. Nader, whose Green Party candidacy for president is seen by many Democrats as having hurt AL GORE'S chances against Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Leahy who asked not to be named said the senator had received a fax from someone claiming to be Mr. Nader, but that Judiciary Committee staff members doubted its authenticity.</p>
        <p>Also, the aide said, the committee had too many potential witnesses and too little time available for testimony.</p>
        <p>Biographer Finds Book in the Bushes</p>
        <p>First Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, ELIZABETH TAYLOR, Frank Sinatra, NANCY REAGAN and the British royal family. Now, the Bush family. The author KITTY KELLEY has signed a seven-figure deal with Doubleday for a book about the family of the 41st and 43rd presidents.</p>
        <p>Her deal with Doubleday, the details of which were not released, takes her to her third publisher in three books. ''The Royals'' was published by Warner Books in 1997 and ''Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography'' by Simon and Schuster in 1991.</p>
        <p>Doubleday said Ms. Kelley's book on the Bushes would be published in 2004, when President Bush could well be running for a second term.</p>
        <p>No Fur Furor On Ice This Year</p>
        <p>The annual Montreal Fashions on Ice show at Rockefeller Plaza on Monday was notable for not being a rerun. Last year members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, dressed as if they were extras from a touring company of ''Cats,'' invaded the ice to protest the fur trim on designer outfits. The sponsors of the show, which include the National Bank of Canada, the Canadian Consulate General and the City of Montreal, decided not to risk a replay of last year's disturbances: there were no fur fashions this year.</p>
        <p>That left models with a lot of leather and skaters with a lot of memories.</p>
        <p>The protest last year ''added fun and kooky distraction to keep you on your toes,'' said DOUGLAS WEBSTER, associate artistic director of the Ice Theater of New York, who choreographed or skated in four numbers on Monday.  ''I felt bad for the PETA people because they couldn't skate and they kept falling all over the place.''</p>
