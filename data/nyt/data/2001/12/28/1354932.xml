        <p>The Devils will leave this morning for games in Vancouver tomorrow and Edmonton on Sunday and they will be taking defenseman Ken Daneyko with them.</p>
        <p>Daneyko has missed the Devils' last seven games with an injury to his right shoulder. He practiced with the team at full speed yesterday and is ready to play. In order to do so, however, the Devils must take him off the injured reserve list by tomorrow night's game.</p>

        <p>The Devils will leave this morning for games in Vancouver tomorrow and Edmonton on Sunday and they will be taking defenseman Ken Daneyko with them.</p>
        <p>Daneyko has missed the Devils' last seven games with an injury to his right shoulder. He practiced with the team at full speed yesterday and is ready to play. In order to do so, however, the Devils must take him off the injured reserve list by tomorrow night's game.</p>
        <p>That means the Devils will have to put forward Jay Pandolfo, who has sore ribs, on the injured reserve list or send someone to the minor leagues. Pandolfo has missed three games and will not accompany the team on the trip.</p>
        <p>The only defenseman who can be sent to the minors without having to clear waivers is Mike Commodore. But Commodore has played so well during Daneyko's absence that he will probably not be sent down. Another option might be to demote defenseman Tommy Albelin because he has not played in the last five games.</p>
