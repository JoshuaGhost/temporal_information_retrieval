        <p>Ortec International, a start-up company based in New York that has developed a wound treatment product containing live human skin cells, said yesterday that it had hired a sales force from PDI, a health products marketing specialist, to market the new product to the 150 or so hospitals with major centers for the treatment of burn victims. Ortec's engineered living tissue stimulates regrowth of the victim's own skin. The product is not currently aimed at treating burns directly but rather for use in repairing the areas of the patient's body where skin has been removed to use as a graft on the burned area. Ortec, which will get all revenue from sales made by PDI, will pay PDI an undisclosed fee for a two-year contract.</p>
