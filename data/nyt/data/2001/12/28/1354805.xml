        <p>A year ago, Emmanuel McDaniel was the Giants' nickel cornerback and led the team with six interceptions. Johnnie Lynn, the defensive backfield coach, estimated that McDaniel played in 600 to 700 of the Giants' 1,200 defensive plays.</p>
        <p>This season has been different. McDaniel has played much less on defense, not because of slippage on his part, but because of the quick development of the rookie cornerbacks Will Allen and Will Peterson.</p>

        <p>A year ago, Emmanuel McDaniel was the Giants' nickel cornerback and led the team with six interceptions. Johnnie Lynn, the defensive backfield coach, estimated that McDaniel played in 600 to 700 of the Giants' 1,200 defensive plays.</p>
        <p>This season has been different. McDaniel has played much less on defense, not because of slippage on his part, but because of the quick development of the rookie cornerbacks Will Allen and Will Peterson.</p>
        <p>That will change Sunday when the Giants (7-7) meet the Eagles (9-5) in Philadelphia in a game the Giants must win to keep their playoff hopes alive. With Jason Sehorn sidelined by an ankle injury, Peterson seems sure to replace Sehorn at right cornerback opposite Allen at left cornerback. Peterson's job as the nickel back, playing in passing situations, will be taken over by McDaniel.</p>
        <p>When McDaniel talked about the personnel shift after practice today, he played the part of the good soldier. ''Everybody wants to be out there for every play,'' he said, ''but it doesn't work that way. Our defense is based on one big puzzle, and I am part of that puzzle. We've all got a role.''</p>
        <p>Until now, McDaniel has played on defense only in what the Giants call a quarter defense. He was one of six defensive backs on the field and usually covered a slot receiver.</p>
        <p>His defensive statistics are almost incidental: eight tackles, a fumble recovered, a pass knocked down. His main contributions have come on special teams, where he has 13 tackles. He is on the field for punts, punt returns, kickoffs and kickoff returns.</p>
        <p>On punts, he is a gunner, the outside man who races down and tries to reach the return man as the ball does. ''It is a tough job,'' he said, ''but someone's got to do it.''</p>
        <p>McDaniel played at East Carolina University, and this is his sixth season in the National Football League. He spent stretches with the Carolina Panthers, the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins before the Giants signed him in 1999 as a free agent. He never played regularly until last season.</p>
        <p>One reason may be his size: 5 feet 9 inches and 180 pounds. Another may be his lack of raw speed, which teams seek in a cornerback or nickel back. But Andy Reid, the Eagles' coach, says he has a lot of respect for McDaniel. Despite the Giants' secondary shuffling, Reid said, ''Nothing will change for us.''</p>
        <p>Lynn, the Giants' secondary coach, was not so sure. He said the Giants would miss Sehorn's experience and his ability to cover a big receiver. But he also said McDaniel was more than a fill-in.</p>
        <p>''He's not a guy going out there with no experience,'' Lynn said. ''He's a guy who has made plays.''</p>
        <p>McDaniel has good coverage ability. Lynn described him as frisky.</p>
        <p>''All his life,'' Lynn said, ''people have said to him: 'You're not big enough. You're not fast enough.' But off what he did last year, I'd say he's big enough and fast enough. He wouldn't be here if he couldn't play. Those six interceptions last year were a tremendous number of plays for someone who wasn't on the field all the time.''</p>
        <p>John Fox, the Giants' defensive coordinator, described McDaniel as ''very competitive, very scrappy.''</p>
        <p>''He's always sneaking up and making plays,'' Fox said. ''Look at that pass he took from Cris Carter in the championship game last year.''</p>
        <p>In the National Football Conference title game against the Minnesota Vikings, the Giants were leading, 14-0, when Daunte Culpepper passed to Carter in the end zone. McDaniel intercepted, and the Giants went on to a 41-0 victory that put them in Super Bowl XXXV.</p>
        <p>Now McDaniel is getting a chance to prove himself again.</p>
        <p>''I'm excited to be playing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That almost sounded like a crack in the good-soldier armor.</p>
        <p>''No,'' McDaniel said. ''You should always be excited.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants' injury list for Sunday was unchanged. Cornerback JASON SEHORN (ankle) and the backup guard RICH SEUBERT (knee) are out, running back DAMON WASHINGTON (knee) is doubtful and fullback GREG COMELLA (shoulder) is probable. Comella practiced Thursday. . . . RON DIXON took his usual practice plays at wide receiver, but it seemed almost certain he would not return kickoffs Sunday after two disastrous returns last Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. . . . Coach JIM FASSEL summed up the state of the Giants this way: ''We're reasonably healthy. Our attitude is good. We know how to play on the road. For us, this game is clearly a matter of survival. I told the team to just relax. You don't have to be any different. There is nothing we should be afraid of.''</p>
