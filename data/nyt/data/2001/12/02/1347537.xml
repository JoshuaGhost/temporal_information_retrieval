        <p>BLACK SERIES</p>
        <p>Poems.</p>
        <p>By Laurie Sheck.</p>
        <p>100 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $23.</p>
        <p>Laurie Sheck's language and style could not be more of the moment; to read her new book, ''Black Series,'' is an education in the poetic diction of our time. Take the opening lines of ''Then a Dusk Like This'': ''Then a dusk like this, a subversion of surfaces, / a vague expectancy of absence. Blurrings. Wings. / I watch the edges break and flee; they are Ophelias. / Soft town that settles on this land, town of inconclusiveness, / encryption, I touch your gateless air, your scaffoldless / upholdings.''</p>
        <p>The phenomenon is just what William Collins described, some 250 years ago, in ''Ode to Evening'': ''Thy dewy fingers draw / The gradual dusky veil.'' In these lines, the personification of evening, the pretty adjective ''dewy'' and the prop of the ''veil'' mark the poem as 18th-century. But Sheck's version is no less pinned to its time. The late 20th century speaks in her arbitrary metaphors (night as a ''soft town,'' the outlines of things as ''Ophelias''), her vagueness of reference (''like this''), her solemn ejaculations (''Blurrings. Wings.'') and her Latinate jargon, now scientific (''encryption''), now political (''subversion'').</p>
        <p>Sheck's conventions lead her toward extremity and strangeness rather than urbanity and balance, but that does not make them less conventional. Like many poets in the modern tradition, she relies on charged words and phrases to create an atmosphere of portent and high emotion rather than attending to precision or sense; she writes vaguely but at a high volume. Intensities abound: things are ''most delicate,'' ''so dominant, so focused.'' There are melodramatic locutions: ''How can they know uncertainty, the mannequins''; ''The gaze needs to be healed, I thought''; ''Deathmask!'' Such phrases sound stagy because they are really soliloquies, and therefore self-regarding: they mean to draw our attention to the intensity of the poet's feeling rather than to the things described.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the lineage of Sheck's devices is jarringly particular. There is a mysterious litany in ''The Store Windows Glitter'' -- If there be abundant sand left (there is not) / If there be certainty and stillness (there is not) / If there be stalled brilliances and volatile undoings'' -- that echoes several of T. S. Eliot's. ''The Waste Land'' tolls austerely through ''In Curious May,'' whose title echoes a phrase from ''Gerontion.'' Sheck's previous book, ''The Willow Grove'' (1996), frequently echoed Sylvia Plath, to the point of parody in the poem ''Sycamore,'' whose very title alludes to her first name: ''stiff, cataleptic, / hardened in an attitude of writhing, / seized out of the sizzling climacteric, / witch-girl, barren sister.''</p>
        <p>Plath is less of a presence in ''Black Series,'' though she can be felt in the stuttering repetitions (''mouths and mouths and mouths'') and an occasional witchery of atmosphere. But the new book owes more to Sheck's contemporary, Jorie Graham. Sheck's ''Instructions for a Black and White Photograph'' is a series of numbered phrases, just like Graham's ''Self-Portrait as the Gesture Between Them.'' In ''Traces,'' Sheck meditates on military installations in the desert, just as Graham mused on B-52's in ''What the End Is For.'' The poem ''No Threshold'' is remarkably Grahamish in conception, language, and even layout on the page:</p>
        <p>that there isno threshold</p>
        <p>wind sweeping</p>
        <p>the trees light-glint on grass the irises blooming then not</p>
        <p>the daylilies blooming then not</p>
        <p>then frost then gusts of snow</p>
        <p>Sheck is also fond of one of Graham's most common stylistic techniques, the inappropriate adjective. In her 1997 book ''The Errancy,'' Graham wrote of ''caustic justice,'' ''scorched comprehension''; in ''Black Series,'' Sheck has ''scorched vigilance,'' ''silvery amnesias,'' ''windy contingencies.'' To a certain extent, Sheck and Graham both inherit this tone and style from Eliot; but Graham is such a strong and established voice that it is dangerous to imitate her even collaterally.</p>
        <p>Inwardly, however, Sheck is a very different poet, and writes out of a different experience of the world. Graham is abstract, intelligent, metaphysical; Sheck is obsessive and violent, dealing in symbol rather than concept. What is most characteristic of Sheck is her combination of definite emotion and imprecise language. ''The Horses'' is an excellent example of both: ''Broadcast-light flickers, torn and adamant, against the wall. / It would slash the sea's black horses, / or eat away at them like acids. / But the horses lift their heads out past the rocks, / their eyes unbewildered by / this livid inside light.''</p>
        <p>The metaphor is grotesquely mixed. The sea might sound like stampeding horses, but what are these horses' heads? Is light a knife or an acid, and can either of these be torn or adamant? And the frequencies that carry broadcast signals are not visible, so ''broadcast-light'' couldn't flicker in any case. But the symbology of this passage is clear: the world of light is the world of TV broadcasts, and elsewhere in the poem it is identified with ''false conclusions'' and ''serial-killers'' and acquisitiveness. Opposing it is the world of gentle darkness, the sea, black horses -- a scheme of icons allied to the word ''black'' in the book's title.</p>
        <p>In ''The Burned Tree,'' television is once more a sign of inauthenticity: ''And then a voice said stay tuned to this same station, / but there are so many crossings the mind desires; I wanted to set out, / to feel the sweet pulsations of being; I wasn't caught in black and white, / not part of that, not tethered to a screen.'' And in ''Sun,'' the mythological cave where the sun spends the night is another imagined refuge: ''The cave's far off now, who knows where. Ever smaller / in my mind, thin as a dropped stick of gum. / No headlines lived in it, no cover stories, times or dates. / The sea sounding always like the sea. I couldn't change the channel.''</p>
        <p>Sheck's characteristic strain is a high Romantic longing for sleep, death and night, whose songs lure her from the urban, daylight world. It is a traditional subject that Sheck updates by clothing it in the garments of our time: the feeling is Keats, the setting DeLillo. (A poem in ''The Willow Grove'' was titled ''White Noise.'') But to renew the venerable themes is difficult. It requires irony, surprise and precision far more than a familiar extremity, no matter how sincere.</p>
