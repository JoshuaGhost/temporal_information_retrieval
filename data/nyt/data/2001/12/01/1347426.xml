        <p>When the call comes from Jeff Van Gundy, Travis Knight rises, and as he heads to the scorer's table, the cheering begins. The ball lands in his hands and the fans grow louder, screeching for him to shoot. It is the usual home crowd support for an end-of-the-bench player, the sort of support Knight does not want.</p>
        <p>He does not want to be a player whose minutes on the floor occur when the Knicks are up or down by a big margin. In recent games, while his minutes have still been scarce, Knight has become a part of the rotation and a regular contributor.</p>

        <p>When the call comes from Jeff Van Gundy, Travis Knight rises, and as he heads to the scorer's table, the cheering begins. The ball lands in his hands and the fans grow louder, screeching for him to shoot. It is the usual home crowd support for an end-of-the-bench player, the sort of support Knight does not want.</p>
        <p>He does not want to be a player whose minutes on the floor occur when the Knicks are up or down by a big margin. In recent games, while his minutes have still been scarce, Knight has become a part of the rotation and a regular contributor.</p>
        <p>The 7-foot Knight did not budge from the bench in the first four games this season and appeared in only three of the first nine games for a total of nine minutes. But he played nine minutes in the 10th game against Golden State and has appeared in five straight games.</p>
        <p>He hit both field-goal attempts in a victory at Atlanta on Wednesday, grabbed 5 rebounds in 11 minutes against Chicago last week and proved to be a capable defender.</p>
        <p>But Knight knows it is a temporary reprieve. Passing Clarence Weatherspoon on his way off the practice floor today, Knight saw that a walking boot was still on Weatherspoon's right foot, so Knight's time in the rotation remains safe for another game, Saturday night against Detroit.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we have some injuries now,'' Knight said. ''It's real easy to understand Jeff. He doesn't have any agendas. He just really wants to win. So whatever matchups he thinks are going to give his team the best chance to win is what he's going to go with. It's not about who has the contracts.''</p>
        <p>So Knight fills in for Marcus Camby at times and guards the likes of Shareef Abdur-Rahim. And he tries to prove that he is not the N.B.A. hanger-on that the mock cheers would make him out to be.</p>
        <p>Knight has had his moments in the league, earning second-team all-rookie honors with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996-97. He had an 18-point, 13-rebound effort against the Knicks that season and he has scored 21 points in a game twice. A first-round pick out of Connecticut by the Chicago Bulls, he shuttled between the Lakers and the Celtics before landing in New York last season as part of the Patrick Ewing deal. He logged a career-low 256 minutes in 45 games, fewer than 6 a game.</p>
        <p>''I think the first year that I didn't play a lot it really kind of messed with my head,'' Knight said. ''But now I'm comfortable with it.''</p>
        <p>He said the role was not one ''you ever want to truly accept,'' but added, ''You've got to just be happy with it as long as you're doing everything you can do.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said Knight was not in good shape when he arrived in New York last season and did not shoot well, but said, ''This year, I think he's much more prepared to play well.''</p>
        <p>''Still, when Clarence gets back and we're healthy, he won't be in the regular rotation,'' Van Gundy said. ''I like to have guys like he and Felton Spencer, who when given the opportunity are ready to play and seize the opportunity and know who they are as players. Some guys just have no idea in the N.B.A. who they are or where they fit in. They think they're the best player or the second-best player in the league and that if they're not being used that way, they're being cheated.''</p>
        <p>Knight has earned a bit of respect from his coach. Now, he would like the same from the fans.</p>
        <p>''Honestly, whatever the fans do, that's fine,'' Knight said. ''You can't really control that. Support is support. I know what I've done and what I can do.''</p>
