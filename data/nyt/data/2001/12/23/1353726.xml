        <p>MAURICE DE WITT, 62, sat in his small room packed full with hand-me-downs and secondhand stuff, dreading the prospects of Christmas Eve. He smoked  cigarettes and drank stout from the bottle, philosophizing on his role as the second-most-famous Santa Claus in town.</p>
        <p>All the love and humanity that people bestow on this otherwise ordinary man will evaporate tomorrow night, and he will return unwillingly to his obscure corner in the city.</p>
        <p>'''An old man,'' he said. His eyes clouded with tears, and he washed down the lump in his throat with the dark stout.</p>
        <p>''It's back to this small, lonely room,'' he said to some visitors, who come less frequently as the years pass. ''People don't care so much about Santa when the Christmas thing is over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. De Witt has the grammatical habit of freely interchanging the words Santa and I and me.</p>
        <p>And if you had ever seen him work Rockefeller Center on one knee, posing for photos and hugging children, you'd say he was entitled to it.</p>
        <p>For 11 months of the year, Mr. De Witt says he is a nobody, and during the dog days of August, when he is sitting in this cramped room on the Upper East Side, thoughts of the kisses and the little waving hands waft through his mind. He chews on these memories as though they were small bits of beef.</p>
        <p>Santa got up stiffly and helped himself to a second beer. His knees are rheumatic, he has diabetes and he has not worked the corner for two weeks since he nearly collapsed from a mild heart attack.</p>
        <p>''That suit is so hot,'' Santa said, lighting another Winston. ''I feel better, so I'm hoping to get out there one more time before dusk on Christmas Eve. One more shot to get me through.''</p>
        <p>He stretched back in his lounge chair and told the parable of the man with size 10 feet. He wore size 9 shoes that pinched his toes and cramped his arches. But he insisted on wearing them because when he got home and took them off, he got a small amount of pleasure.</p>
        <p>''Man, that's just like the Santa suit,'' he said. ''I get the memories, you know? Santa don't live at the North Pole. He might live on the streets and eat out of the trash. He might be the most powerful man on Wall Street, you never know.''</p>
        <p>The best thing, Mr. De Witt surmised, is to suspect everyone of being Santa, treat everybody with dignity, all year round.</p>
        <p>''And if you're so inclined on Christmas,'' he asked his visitors and all believers of Santa Claus, ''say a little prayer.''</p>
