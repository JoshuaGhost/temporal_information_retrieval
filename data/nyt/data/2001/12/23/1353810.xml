        <p>While more than three-quarters of 145 non-Muslim nations around the world are now democracies, most  countries with an Islamic majority continue to defy the trend, according to a survey published last week by Freedom House in New York.</p>
        <p>In the Islamic world, the survey found 11 democratic countries, or only 23 percent of the 47 nations that are predominantly Muslim.</p>
        <p>''Since the early 1970's, when the third major historical wave of democratization began, the Islamic world, and, in particular, its Arab core, have seen little evidence of improvements in political openness, respect for human rights and transparency,'' said the new survey, ''Freedom in the World 2001-2002.''</p>
        <p>''In countries where there is an Islamic majority, there is just one free country, Mali, while 18 are rated partly free and 28 are not free,'' said Freedom House, an independent monitor of political rights and civil liberties.</p>
        <p>Among the most democratic Muslim countries after Mali are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey and Morocco, according to the survey.</p>
        <p>The Freedom House surveys measure areas like the right to form political parties representing a wide range of views and the right to seek elected office; the protection of religious, ethnic, linguistic, gender and economic rights; and the protection of freedoms of the press, belief and association. Assigned numerical rankings, countries are declared free, partly free or not free.</p>
        <p>The absolute rankings used by Freedom House, however, cannot reflect all political trends or developments in a given country, where the realities of daily life may be more complicated or even at some variance with the place that nation is assigned on the survey's list.</p>
        <p>At the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Sweden, Bengt Save-Soderbergh, the organization's secretary general, said that under the surface in many Muslim nations there were interesting developments, and they were not always recognized and supported by democratic countries.</p>
        <p>''In a few countries, extremist fundamentalism has dominated for some time, but in a much larger number of countries efforts at democratization are much more important,'' Mr. Save-Soderbergh said in an exchange of e-mail messages  from the institute, which is supported by democratic governments, though not the United States.</p>
        <p>''People driving these democratic processes often face very tough conditions,'' he said. ''They are challenged by a combination of corrupt governments, fundamentalists and international double standards. As an example, I think it was most unfortunate that the world at large did not respect the outcome of the elections in Algeria in 1992, when an Islamic party was denied an electoral victory and the army took over.''</p>
        <p>The Islamic party never had to face ''the tough realities of participatory democracy,'' he said. Many Muslims, including in Iran, have learned that religion does not solve a country's social or economic problems and is not a substitute for democracy, he said.</p>
        <p>In general, the Freedom House survey found that 121 of the world's 192 governments -- or 63 percent -- are electoral democracies, the highest figure ever recorded. Around the world, 86 countries are considered genuinely free by the survey; 29, including the United States, received a perfect score.</p>
        <p>The 10 lowest-ranking countries according to the survey were Afghanistan (before the war), Cuba, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Turkmenistan.</p>
        <p>The emergence of mass terrorism may threaten the ''tranquillity'' of democracies, Freedom House said, but democratic governments and free-market systems were likely to prove resilient because citizens have ''a sense of ownership.''</p>
