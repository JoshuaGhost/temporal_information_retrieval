        <p>IF you haven't purchased all your holiday presents yet, too bad.</p>
        <p>There is nothing left. At least at Macy's, where I've taken up temporary residence since just before Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>It all started innocently enough when I dropped into my local Macy's at Essex Green to return a pair of pants I'd bought for my son. As it happened, the day I walked in was one of their legendary one-day sales. There were markdowns on markdowns. It was like an economics lesson in deflation. Sweaters that looked and felt like cashmere (but were made out of some petroleum derivative) were going for $10. I bought three.</p>
        <p>Employees were taking down signs that said 40 percent off and replacing them with signs that said 50 percent off. If you had a Macy's charge card, another discount. If you opened a Macy's charge account, another discount still.</p>
        <p>Cash register magic: one sweater rung up at $4.50.</p>
        <p>It was like finding an amazing fishing hole, or a tree that actually grew money. It didn't matter if I didn't really need all those new sweaters. Macy's was practically giving them away.</p>
        <p>My mother-in-law, who hates shopping, got caught up in the same one-day-sale frenzy. Watching in disbelief as the prices dropped, she told the cashier wryly, ''What, are you going to pay me to take this?''</p>
        <p>Thus began a new tradition in the suburbs: trading Macy's stories. I was sure I had everyone beat with my $4.50 sweater, until I found out that a cousin of mine in Fairlawn had bought one for 19 cents.</p>
        <p>I discovered that the world was divided into two kinds of people: those whose hearts race at the thought of a 19-cent sweater, and everybody else.</p>
        <p>My friend Julia vowed she would never set foot in a department store from October through January because of the crowds. Others expressed pity.</p>
        <p>''They're not making any money,'' Liza said sadly.''</p>
        <p>Barbara of the socialist bent asked, ''Is all this stuff made by slaves?''</p>
        <p>Then there were those who confessed that they preferred paying retail. Odd creatures.</p>
        <p>''I grew up clipping coupons my whole life,'' said one, whose identity I will protect. ''I'd rather pay full price.''</p>
        <p>At lunches and holiday parties, we analyzed the issue of the 19-cent sweater like Samuelson or Keynes. Still the coupons kept arriving with each day's mail.</p>
        <p>But then one day, coupons and charge card ready, I found the fishing hole had dried up. The 50 percent off signs -- vanished. I paid $20 for a sweater. Ripoff.</p>
        <p>Macy's was playing games with me, taking advantage of my greed and gullibility. ''You sound like a gambler in Atlantic City,'' Liza said. ''Your eyes are all shiny and you're talking about coupons.''</p>
        <p>She was right.</p>
        <p>I talked to Elina Kazan, publicity director for Macy's East, who told me that New Jersey had more Macy's stores than any other state but California. She insisted that the markdowns weren't any steeper than usual -- though she had just bought a $435 leather jacket for $106.</p>
        <p>''I'm the consummate shopper,'' she said. ''It has to do with timing, luck, your shopping skills. I know when to strike.''</p>
        <p>Strike?</p>
        <p>The day after speaking to Ms. Kazan, I saw the TV commercial -- Macy's One-Day Sale. My instincts took over. Never mind that I'd already cleaned my closet out twice to make room for all my new sweaters. I hadn't even started on accessories. I had one hour. I wound up with two handbags, a hat, a scarf, another sweater, two watches, two pins and a bracelet: $140.</p>
        <p>The next day I was out with friends, breathlessly recounting the sale. I got this, I said, holding up a brown Liz Claiborne handbag.</p>
        <p>''Nice,'' my friends murmured. ''Beautiful.''</p>
        <p>''Is it leather?'' one asked.</p>
        <p>My shopping skills were on the line. ''I think it's leather,'' I said.</p>
        <p>The purse was passed around.</p>
        <p>''It looks like leather,'' said one. The next nodded.</p>
        <p>Then it got to Molly. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>''Pleather,'' she announced.</p>
        <p>Pleather?</p>
        <p>Later I looked at the label inside: 100 percent polyvinyl chloride.</p>
