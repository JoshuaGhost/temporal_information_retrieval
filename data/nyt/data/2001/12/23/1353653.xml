        <p>AT Iceland in New Hyde Park, the ice is in use 18 to 20 hours a day, seven days a week, and figure skaters are given ice time at weekday morning freestyle sessions beginning at 5:30 a.m. Rich Roulston, Iceland's general manager, said children as young as 6 are being brought in by their parents before school to work on their moves.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants the prime-time ice between 4 and 10 p.m.,'' Mr. Roulston said. ''The secret is to book the rink during the dead time the rest of the day.''</p>

        <p>AT Iceland in New Hyde Park, the ice is in use 18 to 20 hours a day, seven days a week, and figure skaters are given ice time at weekday morning freestyle sessions beginning at 5:30 a.m. Rich Roulston, Iceland's general manager, said children as young as 6 are being brought in by their parents before school to work on their moves.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants the prime-time ice between 4 and 10 p.m.,'' Mr. Roulston said. ''The secret is to book the rink during the dead time the rest of the day.''</p>
        <p>The Dix Hills Rink is on a 24-hour schedule, booking youth hockey lessons as early as 4 a.m. ''Our hockey coaches come in at 3 a.m., after our midnight adult hockey league ends its game, and the kids start coming for lessons at 4,'' said Laura Gersh, director of parks and recreation for the Town of Huntington, which operates the Dix Hills Rink. ''Some are as young as 8 years old, and they really love it.''</p>
        <p>Winter took a long time coming this year, but a string of balmy November and December days did nothing to ease demand for the Island's 18 ice rinks. Even at rates running as high as $310 an hour for ice time, groups seeking reserved ice for the season had already lined up in late summer to plead their cases before rink managers.</p>
        <p>''Every faction has a pressure group, and we listen to all of them,'' said Richard Arenella, superintendent of the Great Neck Park District, which operates the Parkwood Rink.</p>
        <p>So if hockey players need it for games, figure skaters require it for practice and recreational skaters demand it for fun and exercise, who gets the ice?</p>
        <p>''That's one of the trickiest questions in the business,'' said Robert Thornton, manager of Iceworks, a privately owned two-rink ice skating center in Syosset. ''The Islanders train here during the season, we have adult open hockey time, freestyle figure skating sessions, youth hockey leagues, clinics, classes, you name it. Everyone wants ice. Where we cut back is on public sessions.''</p>
        <p>Priorities are different at the municipally owned Parkwood Rink. ''We can't simply look at profit,'' Mr. Arenella said. ''We have a community to answer to. So we have to use strategy in giving out slots in ways that help support the cost of the rink and provide a public service at the same time. We serve our local organizations first. The last people we put on the schedule are the people who want private ice.''</p>
        <p>Talking softly may have nothing to do with it, but one secret to success in this competition is to carry a big stick. ''The hockey guys always get first call on time because most skaters are hockey players,'' said Robert Raines, a Great Neck resident and former president of the Long Island Speed Skating Club. ''Figure and speed only get the leftover time, no matter what.''</p>
        <p>At the Rinx, a two-rink facility in Hauppauge, the owner, Jerry Hart, has arranged late-morning hockey programs for police officers and firefighters who work the night shift. When that session ends, he said, the Rinx runs a program called lunchtime hockey, a one-hour hockey session for local business people that includes a game and a light meal. Afterward he provides a skating session for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''The ice gets maximum use this way,'' said Mr. Hart, who has owned the Rinx for 10 years. ''We know we can't shoehorn everyone into the hours they want, so we spread out the usage.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the time the two rinks are used for the normal array of hockey clinics and games, freestyle practices and public sessions, including time for teenagers with a D.J. providing music.</p>
        <p>Richard Gardner, who operates the Newbridge Arena in Bellmore under a lease from the Town of Hempstead, said: ''As much as we try to juggle schedules, I never have enough ice. But sooner or later someone drops out. We really wanted to give time to the girls' hockey team, the Long Island Waves, and we finally were able to offer them spring and summer practice ice. It's not everything they wanted, but at least it's a start.''</p>
        <p>Newbridge Arena is the home rink of Emily Hughes, a 12-year-old figure skater from Kings Point who recently qualified to compete for a place on the 2002 United States Olympic team. But her big sister, Sarah, who is considered a favorite for an Olympic medal next year, no longer trains at Newbridge Arena, or anywhere else on Long Island. Though she still lives at home with her family and attends Great Neck North High School, Sarah Hughes commutes to a rink in Hackensack, N.J., according to Kim Bennett, director of figure skating at Newbridge Arena.</p>
        <p>It's not for lack of ice time. ''She needs to skate with more competitive skaters than we have here on Long Island,'' Ms. Bennett said. ''When you're that good, you need others at your level to give you a push. They're all in Hackensack, so that's where she has to go.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Weintraub has been bringing her 15-year-old son, David, from their home in Lido Beach to the New Hyde Park rink at 6:30 a.m. four times a week for the past six years. Afternoons he skates at the rinks in either Cantiague County Park in Hicksville, Long Beach Arena or Newbridge Arena, depending on which facility has scheduled a time slot that day for figure skaters.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind the early morning hours that much, but it sure would be wonderful to have more time at one rink,'' Ms. Weintraub said. ''It's the traveling from rink to rink because figure skaters are only given certain blocks of ice time that gets so wearing.''</p>
        <p>But David said he finds the traveling gives him an edge. ''I skate twice a day but never at the same rink,'' he said, ''and that actually helps me in competitions, because I'm accustomed to getting used to new ice all the time.''</p>
        <p>In any event, David won a silver medal in the eastern sectional division of the United States Figure Skating Association competition this fall. The Long Beach High School freshman will go to Los Angeles in January to compete on the national level as a member of the novice team.</p>
        <p>With all the demand, it would seem reasonable that developers would be drawing up blueprints for new rinks all over the Island. Not so. ''February comes and people lose interest in ice skating,'' Mr. Arenella said. ''It's all very intense when it lasts, but it's a seasonal thing, and when it ends it's over for us.''</p>
