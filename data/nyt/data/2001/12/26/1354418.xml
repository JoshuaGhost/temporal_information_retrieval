        <p>For three years now, the euro has been a ''virtual'' currency, existing only in the ether-world of electronic transactions and bookkeeping but almost undetectable in daily life.</p>
        <p>That is about to change. On Jan. 1, if all goes as planned, automated bank tellers in 12 European countries will start dispensing crisp new euros and stop issuing national currencies like the Spanish peseta, German mark, French franc and Dutch guilder. It will be the last step in an effort that began more than 30 years ago, crowning Europe's boldest achievement yet in becoming a seamless union.</p>
        <p>But even on the eve of that momentous transformation, affecting more than 300 million people, the euro is dogged by a credibility problem that has not been helped by its invisibility to date. Even before its introduction, it has fallen shy of some of the grander ambitions that European leaders had envisioned for it.</p>
        <p>Defying predictions that it would create the monetary equivalent of Airbus's rivalry with Boeing, the currency has not eroded the global dominance of the American dollar. In fact, it has lost about one-fifth of its value against the dollar since 1999.</p>
        <p>More important, it has failed to insulate Europe from outside economic shocks, like the blow provided by the slowdown in the United States, and its value has failed to bounce back even since America plunged into a recession.</p>
        <p>The president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, knows better than anyone these shortcomings and the lack of apparent enthusiasm that the currency has generated.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Duisenberg suggested in a recent interview that one of the barriers to the euro's acceptance has been the absence of cold, hard cash. ''I regard not having the notes in the hands of people as maybe the greatest handicap the E.C.B. has had in gaining confidence of the people at large,'' Mr. Duisenberg said in an interview. ''Although the euro is already with us, the people at large still think of it as a thing that is coming.''</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Duisenberg nor any other economist expects the arrival of cash to boost the euro's exchange rate. But many people believe euro notes and coins will reduce the popular skepticism. The practical advantages, such as not having to change money at most borders, will finally become apparent in real life.</p>
        <p>Except for Britain, Denmark and Sweden, every country within the European Union will be setting prices and accepting payment in the same currency. Small states like Monaco and Vatican City will be minting euros as well, while Balkan territories like Kosovo and Montenegro are adopting the euro by converting the German marks that serve as their de facto currencies now.</p>
        <p>It is an achievement that many people thought would never happen, a dream that dates back almost to the end of World War II and was championed in the late 1970's by President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing of France and the German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt.</p>
        <p>But while the euro has already disappointed certain aspirations and has not been popularly embraced, it has hardly been a failure.</p>
        <p>Most economists and business leaders say the single currency is a healthy step toward openness and more vibrant competition across Europe. Eliminating currency fluctuations between member countries reduces the expense and risk of cross-border business. Prices become easier to compare, for consumers as well as corporate buyers. Profit becomes easier to compare as well, putting pressure on companies to become more efficient.</p>
        <p>''It is, on many levels, a catalyst and a driving force for reform,'' said Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.  ''It will have an effect on the unified growth of Europe.''</p>
        <p>Economists note that the arrival of a tangible European currency is merely the visible tip of a deeper transformation. Because countries joining the monetary union were required to reduce their budget deficits and bring inflation under control, Europe has attained a much higher level of economic stability.</p>
        <p>Inflation is as low in Greece as it is in Germany, slightly above 2 percent. Interest rates on home mortgages in Italy, which routinely reached double-digit levels in the past, are about 5 percent. Spain and Portugal now have budget surpluses, though the current slowdown is producing budget deficits in countries like Germany and Italy.</p>
        <p>Eric Vergnaud, economist at BNP Paribas in Paris, notes that Europe has weathered this downturn much more smoothly than the one in the early 1990's. In 1992, the currencies of Italy and Britain shifted so wildly that both countries had to drop out of Europe's currency-exchange stabilization system.</p>
        <p>Why, then, does the euro generate so little enthusiasm? And will that really change once people have the notes in hand?</p>
        <p>In the European Commission's most recent monthly poll of popular attitudes toward the new currency, only 48 percent of those asked thought the euro would mean more advantages than disadvantages for them. Only 50 percent said that using the new notes and coins would make them feel ''a little more European.''</p>
        <p>''The coins look beautiful,'' remarked Christian Pavic, 20, a steelworker in Frankfurt, as he contemplated the handful of coins in one of the ''starter kits'' that went on sale earlier this month. But he added: ''I find it difficult because of the conversion. I would have preferred to keep the mark.''</p>
        <p>Part of the euro's problem stems not from the currency itself but from the gauzy mixture of political expectations that surrounded its creation. When the euro was formally adopted on New Year's Eve 1999, Jacques Santer, then president of the European Commission, declared that ''in one single blow, Europe is imposing itself on the world's financial and monetary map.''</p>
        <p>There were also widespread expectations that the euro would unleash a new era of economic growth, as companies took greater advantage of pan-European opportunities and greater stability. Those predictions were not entirely wrong: Europe experienced a big surge in cross-border corporate mergers and European companies began raising much more money than before through international stock and bond offerings.</p>
        <p>The real problem is that Europe continues to fall behind in other areas. Job-protection laws remain rigid and taxes are high in many countries. Europe has lagged behind the United States in economic growth throughout the past decade, as homegrown companies like Siemens have shifted jobs overseas and international investors have flocked to the United States.</p>
        <p>''The weakness that the euro has shown over the past two years, which we had not expected, obviously reflects the weakness of Europe as a place to do business,'' said Rolf  Breuer, chairman of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>Frits Bolkestein, the European Commission official in charge of developing common rules for business within the European Union, provides a vivid insight into the difficulties of pushing through broader economic change.</p>
        <p>The European Union already enjoys free trade between member countries, and citizens of one country have an automatic right to live and work in any of the other 14 countries. But companies remain bedeviled by different rules for setting up businesses, raising capital and carrying out seemingly mundane jobs like running a pension fund.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, German leaders torpedoed a 12-year effort to reach agreement on a Europewide set of rules governing corporate takeovers.</p>
        <p>Similarly, European banks are still charging fees as high as 17 percent on cross-border money-transfers. Only after a stormy battle this fall did Mr. Bolkestein finally win approval for a measure to prohibit such fees as of next summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolkestein counts that as one of his successes. But the list of stalled reforms is long: huge battles over a standard European prospectus for raising money from investors; bitter feuds over rules to let pension funds operate across borders; even a months-long logjam over reducing the number of languages required for filing a European patent.</p>
        <p>''We spent about nine hours discussing linguistics,'' fumed Mr. Bolkestein, recalling a meeting in late November at which European cabinet ministers failed to agree on the patent issue. ''It's three steps forward, and two backward.''</p>
        <p>Against that backdrop, the ability of 12 European countries to surrender their national currencies is a stunning achievement. But it is also one whose impact will be indirect and only become apparent over time, even once euros are in hand.</p>
        <p>Daniel Gros, deputy director of Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, once compared the euro to a glacier that moves too slowly for most people to notice.</p>
        <p>But wait, he predicted. ''After 10  years, Europe's landscape will be transformed.''</p>
