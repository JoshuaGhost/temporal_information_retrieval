        <p>The list of also-rans from elections past is riddled with the names of rich candidates who poured millions of dollars of their personal fortunes into doomed bids for elected office. Some people seemed to take a kind of solace in the costly failures. However much may be wrong with the political system, this line of thinking went, at least you cannot buy an election.</p>
        <p>Think of Ross Perot, who spent  $63.5 million on a third-party run for the White House in 1992, and is largely remembered today for the size of his ears and his fondness for pie charts. Or Steve Forbes, who spent  $38 million failing to win the Republican nomination in 1996, only to try for it again in 2000.</p>
        <p>California has been particularly cruel to the hopes of big spenders. Michael Huffington, an oil heir, spent nearly $30 million failing to win a Senate seat there, and Al Checchi, a former airline executive, spent $40 million on a run for governor and never even made it past the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>But the recent successes of some rich candidates who have spent millions upon millions of dollars of their own money running for office is causing political scientists, advocates of campaign finance reform, and the political parties to take a second look at the electability of political neophytes with deep pockets.</p>
        <p>Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire Republican who had never held elected office, won the mayoral race in New York last month after spending $69 million of his own money. Jon S. Corzine, a multimillionaire Democrat, was elected to a New Jersey Senate seat last year after spending $63 million on the race, most of it his.</p>
        <p>And several millionaires less rich than either of them have been elected to the Senate in recent years after spending millions on their own elections.</p>
        <p>''We are seeing more and more of these self-financed candidates,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Maine. ''It raises a number of troubling issues, because it increasingly shows that those with access to wealth have the greatest access to the political process.''</p>
        <p>Opinion polls show that the public is not overly concerned about rich people who spend their own money on campaigns. Surveys of voters leaving New York City polling places last month found that 60 percent of voters said that they were ''not too concerned'' or ''not at all concerned'' about the large sum Mr. Bloomberg spent on the race.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, a leading advocate of campaign finance reform, came to New York to stump  for Mr. Bloomberg even though he did not participate in the city's campaign finance program. Mr. McCain said the issue should not be a litmus test.</p>
        <p>Many rich candidates have tried to turn their wealth to their advantage, making the argument that paying for their own campaigns inoculates them from the influence of campaign contributors. ''Unbought, unbossed,'' was one of Mr. Corzine's tag lines. Mr. Bloomberg ran a commercial in which he boasted, ''I won't ask special interests for a dime.'' Senator  Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, a businessman who owns the Milwaukee Bucks, has long used the line ''Nobody's senator but yours.''</p>
        <p>Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that advocates greater regulation of campaign financing, said that such arguments ''reflect the ultimate triumph of the special interests in totally dampening people's confidence that democracy works.''</p>
        <p>''It's a very cynical, very corrosive attitude, because it essentially disenfranchises the overwhelming majority of the people, this idea that only somebody who is independently wealthy has any chance of being independent,'' Mr. Harshbarger said.</p>
        <p>Jennifer A. Steen, an assistant professor of political science at Boston College, studies rich candidates who pay for much of their campaigns. Her dissertation, which noted that the majority of such candidates lose their elections, was titled ''Money Isn't Everything.''</p>
        <p>But she said that recent events suggest that some self-financing candidates are learning from the mistakes of their predecessors.</p>
        <p>''What's happening is that these candidates are learning how to sell themselves more effectively,'' she said. ''They're learning how to use their millions much more wisely.''</p>
        <p>One way they did that was by moving away from relying heavily  on television advertising. Now, Professor Steen said, wealthy candidates are learning to establish what have come to be called ''AstroTurf networks.''</p>
        <p>''They're like grass-roots networks,'' she said, ''but they involve paying for the kinds of things that other campaigns use volunteers for.''</p>
        <p>It is the rare election that is decided by a single factor. New York's mayoral race was clearly influenced by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, which made Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani enormously popular and gave his endorsement of Mr. Bloomberg unusual weight, and which made some voters more receptive to his pitch that the city needed a businessman to lead the rebuilding.</p>
        <p>Then there was the fracturing of the Democratic Party after its bruising primary and runoff elections.</p>
        <p>But political analysts agreed that the $69 million Mr. Bloomberg spent -- a record for any race but the presidency -- played a major role in his victory.</p>
        <p>The lessons have not been lost on the national parties, which are increasingly trying to recruit rich candidates who will agree to finance their campaigns.</p>
        <p>In 2000, the year Mr. Corzine ran, he was one of six candidates for the United States Senate who lent or contributed more than $1 million to their campaigns, Professor Steen said. Four of the six, including one incumbent, Mr. Kohl, won their races that year.</p>
        <p>''I think that the major effect of this will be to deter nonrich candidates who are perfectly well qualified, who might run perfectly good campaigns, from running in the future against self-financing candidates, because they will say, 'Oh no, they'll be like Corzine and Bloomberg, and I'll have no chance,' '' Ms. Steen said.</p>
        <p>''And that's a shame, because the overwhelming majority of rich, self-financing candidates lose.''</p>
