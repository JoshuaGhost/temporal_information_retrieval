        <p>Many of the older workers at the Ford Motor Company plant remember 1982, when a poor economy and flagging demand for the Escort model assembled here led to a cutback to one daily shift, from two.</p>
        <p>So Monday, when veteran workers heard the surprising news that the same kind of cut, with the loss of 600 jobs, was planned for February, they reacted first with shock and indignation and then with sober and pointed questions about how long the cutbacks would last, the role of seniority and what benefits they would keep.</p>
        <p>For the younger workers, the shock has yet to ebb. Some, like 24-year-old Robert Harrigan of Bricktown, who has worked in the plant's body shop for five years assembling the popular Ranger pickup truck line, the anger was still welling up.</p>
        <p>''I don't have seniority and so I'm definitely gone,'' he said during a break today as he sat in the parking lot of the offices of Local 980 of the United Automobile Workers Union. ''And my wife and I just had a baby.''</p>
        <p>While he and others were angry at the company, the economy and those who had seniority, they were also angry at the union, since the leaders had given them no warning, they said. The workers also complained that even as company officials were outlining the cutbacks in meetings on the plant floor, those union officers were being curiously quiet.</p>
        <p>''They usually talk to us, but they haven't been around much,'' said Anthony San Martin, an eight-year employee. ''I think they think we'll be jumping down their throats.''</p>
        <p>Outside the plant, the concern is growing in Edison Township as well. Township Mayor George Spadoro noted that ever since Ford started construction in Dearborn, Mich., of a large state-of-the-art Ranger factory with its own power plant, there have been fears that the older, smaller plant in Edison was headed for mothballs. It was the start of the Ranger line at the Edison plant in 1989 that had returned the factory to a full two shifts.</p>
        <p>''These cuts will have a ripple effect on the local economy,'' the mayor said of the possible loss of a shift and nearly 42 percent of the 1,425 workers. ''I had been feeling comfortable about the long-term prospects for the plant, but if you make it less productive, it is more likely that it will be seen as expendable down the line.''</p>
        <p>The announcement of the cutbacks Monday was part of a package of companywide changes, including reduced health and retirement benefits for 45,000 salaried workers and the elimination of merit pay increases for top executives. Those changes, as well as the production cutbacks at Edison, were part of the company's response to sagging sales of most product lines.</p>
        <p>Steve Girsky, an analyst who follows Ford for Morgan Stanley, said the company suffered in particular from ''excess capacity'' in its Ranger pickup line.</p>
        <p>''I can't speak to the future, but this could be a prelude to things to come,'' he said. ''Older plants tend not to be as efficient as newer plants, and this is an older plant.''</p>
        <p>Union local officials, like the president, Bob LaPoint, and the chairman, Richard Linn, have been hearing that line of thinking for years from corporate plant managers, and they say that they have worked hard with management to increase productivity and to improve the quality of the trucks assembled here.</p>
        <p>At one time, it cost $800 more to assemble a Ranger here than in other Ford plants, Mr. Linn said.</p>
        <p>They managed to get that down to $200 while improving quality, he said. ''It's very difficult to close a top-quality plant and have shareholders and the public accept that,'' Mr. Linn said, hinting at the campaign that the U.A.W. local plans to mount against the cuts.</p>
        <p>Already, he and Mr. LaPoint have reached out to elected officials like Mayor Spadoro, United States Senator Jon Corzine and Governor-elect James E. McGreevey to begin talks on government incentives to Ford to keep the plant operating at peak levels. Mayor Spadoro said there was a good possibility of tax incentives.</p>
        <p>Unionized workers' pay can range from $22 to $27 an hour, he said.</p>
        <p>As the morning shift was ending, older workers, like Robert Dockery, 55, with 31 years at Ford, said they were sure they would keep their jobs but unsure for how long. He had hoped to hold out for five more years before retiring, but the elimination of a shift convinced him that it was ''just a matter of time'' before the entire plant closed.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaPoint, the union local president, said that despite the company's talk about declining demand for the Ranger, shifts at the Edison plant were still 10 hours, not 8 hours, and Saturday was scheduled as a mandatory overtime day.</p>
        <p>Then, with resolve, he said, ''But you always have to have hope that something will work in your favor.''</p>
