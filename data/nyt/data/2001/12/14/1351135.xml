        <p>''The Thread Unraveled,'' an exhibition at El Museo del Barrio, is a contemporary sideshow to ''Body and Soul,'' the sprawling four-century survey of Brazilian art now on view at the Guggenheim Museum. The two shows are strikingly dissimilar. While the Guggenheim takes viewers on a wild ride through four centuries of artistic extremism, the Barrio's exhibition is subdued, focused, elegant and colorless.</p>
        <p>Organized by the museum's curator, Fatima Bercht, ''The Thread Unraveled'' (a loose translation of its Portuguese title, ''O Fio da Trama'') is not a comprehensive survey of contemporary Brazilian art. It concentrates on 21 artists, most of whom, in one way or another, have made fabric or thread a central motif in their work.</p>

        <p>''The Thread Unraveled,'' an exhibition at El Museo del Barrio, is a contemporary sideshow to ''Body and Soul,'' the sprawling four-century survey of Brazilian art now on view at the Guggenheim Museum. The two shows are strikingly dissimilar. While the Guggenheim takes viewers on a wild ride through four centuries of artistic extremism, the Barrio's exhibition is subdued, focused, elegant and colorless.</p>
        <p>Organized by the museum's curator, Fatima Bercht, ''The Thread Unraveled'' (a loose translation of its Portuguese title, ''O Fio da Trama'') is not a comprehensive survey of contemporary Brazilian art. It concentrates on 21 artists, most of whom, in one way or another, have made fabric or thread a central motif in their work.</p>
        <p>One might expect a larger metaphor to emerge -- something to do with the raveling and unraveling of multicultural society, say -- but it doesn't. You might detect a South American flavor in the works of a few artists: the hanging, stuffed animal skins of Eliane Duarte; Leonilson's delicate, folk-artlike fabric collages with stitched poetic texts; and Luiz Hermano's bristling brown wall-mounted mass made of coconut fiber brushes. But most of the work in the show looks more international than regional, and most of the artists focus more on materials, procedures and personal poetics than broader social or cultural visions.</p>
        <p>Vera Martins, for example, makes a practice of unraveling canvas -- the kind painters paint on. She creates free-standing skeins of off-white thread that hang like wigs on invisible armatures, and she wraps thread around painting stretchers to produce a kind of reconstructed deconstructed Minimalism. Ana Linnemann drills holes in bite-size rocks and threads them together using copper wire and heavy-duty needles. And Marepe makes objects that look like laundry bundles, calling to mind the wrapped sculptures of Christo. You could read various meanings into such works, but what prevails is more factuality than transcendence.</p>
        <p>One of the most uncompromisingly materialist works in the show, however, is also one of the most magical. An untitled work by Laura Vinci consists of a ceiling-mounted square funnel from which fine sand streams as if from the top half of an hourglass. The falling sand disperses into an almost invisible mist before hitting the conical mound on the floor. It's about the passage of real time, but the sand, twinkling like gold in the spotlight, takes on a miraculous, fairy-tale quality.</p>
        <p>In the works of others, accumulation tends to decorative effects, as in a snowy tapestry of white feathers by Lina Kim. Hilal Sami Hilal produced an expansive curtain of sheer, hanging fabric bearing an all-over, vaguely floral pattern made by applying an aluminum powder compound in lumpy arabesques; lacy, Rococo delicacy meets rough-hewn, industrial immediacy.</p>
        <p>Some works combine austere formality and surrealistic suggestion. Monken's ''Floaters'' has illuminated fabric rectangles hovering over stone tiles with sandal straps attached. Paulo Climachauska's ''Ghost,'' a precise arrangement of glass panes, lengths of white fabric and drinking glasses, is like a set-up for an experiment in parapsychology. More conventionally Surrealistic but with a bit of Pop is the work of Nazareth Pacheco, who makes dangerous-looking luxury commodities, like fashionable dresses of beads and razors and a child's swing that sprouts nails from its clear plastic seat. And a gently comical spin on clothing is offered by Efrain Almeida in the form of miniature pink velvet jackets held forth by little wooden hands and a series of identical tiny velvet purses hanging on neatly carved wooden hooks.</p>
        <p>The body's association with fabric perhaps explains the presence of an intriguing, Minimalistic installation by Tatiana Grinberg that evokes the body by a kind of negative representation. Through eyeholes on one side of a wall, one peers through darkness to 10 finger holes penetrating the other side. The body's positive physicality, on the other hand, is closely examined by the photographer Vicente de Mello, whose large black-and-white views of aged flesh call to mind the works of John Coplans.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the artist whose well-known work with fabric best evokes the body, Ernesto Neto, is here represented by minor instances of his pod forms made by filling nylon stockings with lead or plastic foam pellets. Perhaps there was not enough space for one of his marvelous womblike environments.</p>
        <p>In photography, the fabric theme persists in large, semiabstract pictures of colored, woven fabric by Fábio Carvalho. It also appears incidentally in dark scenes of boxers at the gym -- one with a heavily bandaged hand -- by Miguel Rio Branco and in large, documentary color images of elaborately decorated bedrooms by Rochelle Costi. The ubiquitous photographic prankster Vik Muniz turns up here with a set of photographs of ''drawings'' of objects like a running faucet or a suitcase that could have been made of thread but are in fact made of bent and twisted wire.</p>
        <p>How Brígida Baltar's video ''The Harvest of Fog'' relates to the theme is not so clear, but her slow, meditative loop of someone just barely emerging from fog in the distance and then disappearing has a haunting romantic poetry.</p>
        <p>''The Thread Unraveled'' (''O Fio da Trama'') will remain on view at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Feb. 3.</p>
