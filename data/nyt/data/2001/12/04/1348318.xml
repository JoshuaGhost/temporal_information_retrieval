        <p>Taking his antiterror campaign across the border, Attorney General John Ashcroft signed an agreement yesterday in Ottawa intended to keep terrorists and their supporters out of the United States and Canada while keeping $1.3 billion a day in trade flowing freely across the nations' shared 4,000-mile border.</p>
        <p>The accord tightens the asylum procedures in both countries while advancing information sharing and expanding special border-enforcement teams. The pact was signed a day after Mr. Ashcroft announced that 400 National Guard troops would be stationed along the border with Canada and that military helicopters would patrol rural areas.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Taking his antiterror campaign across the border, Attorney General John Ashcroft signed an agreement yesterday in Ottawa intended to keep terrorists and their supporters out of the United States and Canada while keeping $1.3 billion a day in trade flowing freely across the nations' shared 4,000-mile border.</p>
        <p>The accord tightens the asylum procedures in both countries while advancing information sharing and expanding special border-enforcement teams. The pact was signed a day after Mr. Ashcroft announced that 400 National Guard troops would be stationed along the border with Canada and that military helicopters would patrol rural areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashcroft said the troops would relieve customs and immigration officers who have been putting in long hours since Sept. 11. The border has more than 100 crossing points, all now manned 24 hours a day. Before Sept. 11, some posts closed at 10 p.m., when the border agents went home.</p>
        <p>This is the first time in more than a century that soldiers have been used to protect what is often referred to as the longest undefended border in the world. Mr. Ashcroft called it a ''fortification, not militarization,'' of the border and said it should last no more than a year.</p>
        <p>''This is a border that unites us rather than divides us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Canada has been stung by criticism that it had unwittingly become a haven for terrorists and groups that support them. In the last month, Canadian officials have tried to toughen antiterrorism efforts. A counterterrorism law, Canada's first, passed last week in the lower house of Parliament.</p>
        <p>The legislation enhances police surveillance powers and permits pre-emptive arrests. As in the United States, the efforts have raised concerns that civil rights will be trampled in the fight against terrorism.</p>
        <p>Canadians overwhelmingly support the United States, as shown by the thousands of Canadians, led by Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, who crossed the border to attend a pro-United States rally on Saturday in New York City. Even so, Canadian attempts to cooperate on border security invariably evoke criticisms that such actions erode sovereignty.</p>
        <p>''Anything that helps U.S. security helps Canada,'' Canada's solicitor general, Lawrence MacAulay, said.</p>
        <p>The pact will force refugees to seek asylum in the country of arrival rather than seeking the most accommodating country. At major airports, the United States and Canada will share information on arrivals to identify as early as possible people to be placed on watch lists.</p>
        <p>The two countries will work together to develop more sophisticated passports and ''smart'' travel documents that use eye scans and other biometric indicators to determine the legitimacy of passports.</p>
