        <p>Twenty-one correction officers and three prisoners were treated for minor injuries after a disturbance at Rikers Island late Tuesday, when about 20 prisoners in a common area refused to go back to their cells, the City Department of Correction said yesterday. The officers, including three captains, were treated for exposure to a chemical spray used around 11 p.m. to subdue the prisoners, said Sandra Lewis Smith, a deputy correction commissioner. She said that the prisoners' injuries were unrelated to the spray and that the incident lasted only a few minutes. Robert Gangi, executive director of the Corrections Association of New York, a prisoners' rights group, said the spray, known as C4, should be used only as a last resort. Inmates have died from it, he said.</p>
