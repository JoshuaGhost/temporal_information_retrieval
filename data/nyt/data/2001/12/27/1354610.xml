        <p>With less than a week remaining in his term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani again defended the idea of building two new baseball stadiums and lashed out at critics yesterday who suggest that the city should be putting its strained resources elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Baseball is a tremendously big business,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It's like keeping the Stock Exchange here. This is by far, without any doubts, one of the best deals in sports.''</p>

        <p>With less than a week remaining in his term, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani again defended the idea of building two new baseball stadiums and lashed out at critics yesterday who suggest that the city should be putting its strained resources elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Baseball is a tremendously big business,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It's like keeping the Stock Exchange here. This is by far, without any doubts, one of the best deals in sports.''</p>
        <p>Those who criticize the spending of public money on building stadiums while the city is suffering from the economic fallout from a recession and the damage to Lower Manhattan ''haven't the foggiest idea of what they're talking about,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The mayor also said it was important to show the committee making selections for the 2012 Olympics that the city was committed to construction, because the city would need to build an arena to accommodate the Games. Later, on the related matter of building an arena on the West Side of Manhattan that could be used for football games and 100 to 200 indoor events a year, the mayor said that without it, the city would jeopardize its chances of landing the Games.</p>
        <p>Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg, whose administration would have to carry out the stadium plans, said yesterday with Mr. Giuliani by his side that he thought it was good that the current mayor was trying to ensure that the city and its facilities remained ''first class.''</p>
        <p>''Even though we have a current budget problem, we should not forget the future,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''This is a city of big ideas, and big projects and a big heart, and things that take many years to do, you have to continue to work on, even when you happen to have tough times short term.''</p>
        <p>Under the Giuliani plan, the Mets and the Yankees would each pay half of the building costs. A new stadium for the Mets is expected to cost about $800 million to build, while the estimated cost for a new Yankees stadium, which is at an earlier planning stage, has not been disclosed. But officials suggested that it would be a comparable amount. In addition, the mayor said, the state would contribute $300 million to $350 million to help with infrastructure, like new or repaired parking facilities and train stations.</p>
        <p>''The state is going to do all the things that they promised to do some time ago, which is to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on infrastructure,'' Mr. Giuliani said of his plan.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki reiterated yesterday that the state would help with the infrastructure, but not the direct building of the stadiums. ''That's between the city and the private owners,'' he said, ''but we will keep the commitment that has been made to help with infrastructure.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said rent payments would be determined according to a formula, depending on how well the teams performed each year, that would substantially increase what the city earns now. ''We stand to make an enormous amount of money if they have great seasons,'' he said. ''And in weaker seasons, we would do O.K.''</p>
        <p>The mayor also said that the deals, whose final details are still under negotiation, would keep the teams in the city for 35 years and save millions in upkeep on the present stadiums. To maintain the teams' present stadiums for a decade or more, Mr. Giuliani said, ''could cost all of the rent that we get and then some.''</p>
        <p>The plan for the Yankees, in which a new stadium would be built in Macombs Dam Park in the South Bronx, would require the approval of the State Legislature of a plan to substitute parkland for what would be lost in the construction, he said.</p>
