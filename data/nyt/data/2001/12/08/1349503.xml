        <p>Dr. C. Bruce Tarter announced that he would step down as director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, one of the nation's three major weapons laboratories. During a seven-year tenure, Dr. Tarter presided over a major expansion of civilian research at Livermore, but also numerous disputes, including delays and overruns in a $4 billion laser project and complaints of racial and sex discrimination by employees. Saying the laser project was ''aggressively back on track,'' Dr. Tarter added that he had moved to deal with employee concerns.</p>
