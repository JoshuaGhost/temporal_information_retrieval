        <p>The Sony Corporation has sold 1.5 million PlayStation 2 video game consoles since Thanksgiving, giving it a lead over Nintendo, which markets the GameCube, and Microsoft, with its Xbox. Since introducing the game console in March 2000, Sony has sold more than 20 million units, about one-third of those in the United States. In November, however, Nintendo and Microsoft started selling their own game machines, which have sold more than one million units each. In response, Sony has lowered the price of its consoles in some markets.</p>
