        <p>When America Online and Time Warner came together a year ago, their hopes were pegged to the magic of the Internet. Today the brightest spot for the company is the wizardry of Harry Potter.</p>
        <p>Of course, the long-term success or failure of the merger will rest on whether AOL Time Warner can find ways to profit from its unrivaled combination of print and television content with cable and online distribution.</p>
        <p>The company points to the ways it has cross-promoted ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' its hit movie, as evidence of the deal's logic.</p>
        <p>Still, with the economy weak and the advertising market worse, the company's new management team faces a whole range of urgent operating challenges on the way to realizing its enduring dreams of media convergence.</p>
        <p>Analysts note that the slump in ad sales has stymied AOL Time Warner's magazine and television businesses. Subscriber growth at America Online has slowed. Warner Music is a mediocre performer in a troubled industry.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the merged company made things tougher for itself by promising investors very aggressive, and ultimately unrealistic, short-term growth targets and sticking with them long after the economy started to sour.</p>
        <p>''They made a devil's pact with Wall Street,'' said Chris Dixon, an analyst with UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>AOL Time Warner, he explained, tried to portray itself as having the growth trajectory of a much smaller technology company, a pace that was simply unrealistic for a behemoth with $40 billion in annual sales. It promised that free cash flow, a common measure of the earnings power of a media company, would increase by 50 percent a year over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Realistically, Mr. Dixon argues, the company can count on a 20 percent growth rate. Because other well-run media companies can generate just 15 percent growth, he is bullish on AOL.</p>
        <p>''They still have the opportunity to redefine the way we are all going to be informed, entertained and interconnected,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stephen M. Case, the chairman of AOL, admitted that the company was ''too aggressive'' in its promises. ''We had higher expectations for the economy and advertising than what turned out to happen,'' he said yesterday. ''Once you make a commitment, you want to do everything you can to stand by them.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, however, Mr. Case said the company had to back down. ''We decided it's not smart to cut back initiatives that will drive the top line for the next decade in order to meet targets for the next quarter or two,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company boasts of success in stitching its various units together in multimedia marketing campaigns for clients like Kraft Foods and Bank of America. It sells subscriptions to its magazines on all of its Web sites. And it is hard to look at anything that AOL Time Warner is involved in these days and not see the spectacled face of Harry Potter.</p>
        <p>But however much benefit comes from these cross-promotions, they can hardly insulate the company from the cold realities of the market. Over all, advertising revenues have fallen short of expectations. And thousands of hours of commercials pitching AOL's latest software on CNN and the Turner networks have not been able to keep the growth in online subscribers from slowing. (A price increase in July did not help sign-ups.)</p>
        <p>John Tinker, who runs Steamboat Capital, a hedge fund, worries that the slowdown in the growth of online subscribers could well hurt the company over all.</p>
        <p>''It is the glue that holds the company together,'' he said of the America Online service. ''It was a critical component of cash flow growth, and it is the hub around which all the spokes interconnect.''</p>
        <p>Two pending deals have the potential to have a significant impact on the company's finances. First it will probably be forced to buy Bertelsmann's stake in AOL Europe. Shortly after striking the deal to buy Time Warner, AOL worked out a deal to disentangle itself from its venture with Bertelsmann, a big rival in music and publishing. That deal envisioned several outcomes, but the most likely is that Bertelsmann will exercise an option to sell its stake to AOL in January 2002.</p>
        <p>Henry Blodget, the departing Internet analyst for Merrill Lynch, estimates that the $6.75 billion set in the agreement for AOL to pay is three times the market value of the unit today. Moreover, if AOL pays with a combination of stock and debt, as Mr. Blodget expects, the deal will reduce AOL's earnings per share by 4 to 6 percent in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case shrugs off that analysis, recalling that Bertelsmann, its 49.5 percent partner, paid all the costs of expanding AOL Europe, which now has five million subscribers.</p>
        <p>''Five or 10 years from now, people will be talking about what a good deal we got,'' he said.</p>
        <p>More complicated is the range of possibilities related to the restructuring of AT&amp;T, which is currently evaluating several bids to buy some or all of its huge cable system.</p>
        <p>AOL has proposed combining its cable company and AT&amp;T's into a vast system owned by the two companies and run by AOL. Even if that does not happen, AOL would very much like to buy back AT&amp;T's 25 percent ownership stake in Time Warner Entertainment, a holding company for some of its cable and movie studio assets. Analysts say that AOL may have to pay $9 billion or $10 billion to AT&amp;T for this stake.</p>
        <p>Such a deal might well add even more debt to AOL's balance sheet, particularly because the company would probably try to avoid selling stock to pay for the deal when the market is so weak.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon said these deals would hardly push AOL's debt to levels that it would not be able to handle.</p>
        <p>Still, even the future has been hard for AOL this year. Its book publishing unit just closed a highly promoted effort to create a new imprint devoted to electronic books, a product that so far interests futurists more than readers. And the company has found little demand for an array of gadgets, its interactive content on television screens and kitchen countertops.</p>
        <p>Its biggest bet on the future -- selling high-speed versions of its online services through cable systems -- is only now being offered on its own cable systems, and it has yet to gain distribution on any of its rivals' systems.</p>
        <p>Paul W. Noglows, an analyst with J. P. Morgan Chase, argues that it is hardly a problem that AOL's investments are not paying off immediately, because -- as with much technology -- they will grow rapidly once the market develops.</p>
        <p>''AOL was always slower than anyone hoped,'' he said. ''They are laying the groundwork for things that will become very important.''</p>
        <p>CHANGING THE GUARD: THE OVERVIEW  Correction:  December 8, 2001, Saturday  A chart in Business Day yesterday comparing the strengths and weaknesses of AOL Time Warner's businesses on the occasion of its management changes misidentified the movie studio responsible for the fifth biggest opening-weekend box-office gross. ''Rush Hour 2'' was released by the company's New Line Cinema unit, not its Warner Brothers unit.</p>
