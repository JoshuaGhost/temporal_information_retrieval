        <p>AT the ripe old age of 30, Katie Finneran is a true-blue stage vet. She has done Shaw, O'Neill and Guare. She has played barflies and rich girls, giggly ingénues and world-weary lowlifes. She has acquired all the accouterments of the buoyant and deflating life of a New York actress: the tiny Upper West Side apartment, the holding-pattern waitress and nanny jobs, the invigorating roles in Broadway musicals, the memories of call-back auditions that almost led to Something Really Big.</p>
        <p>Such is her theatercentric focus that when she was offered a plum guest spot on the television series ''Frasier,'' she had to be persuaded by friends and advisers to take it, because it meant giving up a role in the workshop production of a musical.</p>

        <p>Three actresses -- Katie Finneran, Jennifer Coolidge and Gretchen Mol -- enjoy something rare in theater: call it kismet, call it luck, call it a perfect fit.</p>

        <p>AT the ripe old age of 30, Katie Finneran is a true-blue stage vet. She has done Shaw, O'Neill and Guare. She has played barflies and rich girls, giggly ingénues and world-weary lowlifes. She has acquired all the accouterments of the buoyant and deflating life of a New York actress: the tiny Upper West Side apartment, the holding-pattern waitress and nanny jobs, the invigorating roles in Broadway musicals, the memories of call-back auditions that almost led to Something Really Big.</p>
        <p>Such is her theatercentric focus that when she was offered a plum guest spot on the television series ''Frasier,'' she had to be persuaded by friends and advisers to take it, because it meant giving up a role in the workshop production of a musical.</p>
        <p>But now, at last, all the mileage she has racked up on her trek across the city's stages is paying off. Having walked into rehearsals for ''Noises Off'' with no special expectations -- ''It was my next job,'' she explained -- Ms. Finneran has walked away with the best notices of her career.</p>
        <p>As Brooke, the accident-prone bimbette of Michael Frayn's slapstick backstage farce at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, she received raves from the critics -- ''Even her cleavage becomes comic,'' Ben Brantley declared in The New York Times last month -- and is regularly being singled out in the chat rooms of theater Web sites.</p>
        <p>''What is your hope? That it's not a bomb,'' Ms. Finneran said over a late afternoon lunch recently, laughing at the serendipity of it all, of being ''discovered'' after years of thinking again and again that the right part had already come along. ''I always thought that way: 'Oh, this is my big break.' 'No, this is my break.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Finneran has stumbled onto a theater truism: breaking out is hard to do. Some actors live a lifetime of casting calls and curtain calls and never have the magnitude of the breakout moment that she is now experiencing, the kind she has been dreaming of since she was 5 years old and performing in Christmas pageants in Miami. ''It's just,'' she said, ''an absolutely delicious gig.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Finneran is not the only actress in New York these days who is feeling the elation that comes from discovering her performance is being applauded loudly at the curtain and talked about long after.</p>
        <p>At the American Airlines Theater, where the Roundabout Theater Company revival of ''The Women'' is running, the comedic actress Jennifer Coolidge, best known for inspired clowning in movies like ''Legally Blonde'' and ''Best in Show,'' has drawn across-the-board plaudits for her hilarious portrayal of a society wife in the family way who has no interest in raising a family.</p>
        <p>And at the Promenade Theater on the Upper West Side, the in-demand film actress Gretchen Mol (''Rounders,''  ''The Cradle Will Rock,''  ''Celebrity'') has caused a stir with her performance in Neil LaBute's ''Shape of Things'' as a naïve college girl with the loopiest of wedding plans: she wants to get married underwater. The play, which revolves around Pygmalion-like manipulations in the romance of a young woman (played by Rachel Weisz) and a gullible young man (Paul Rudd), was a hit earlier this year in London with the same cast. While some New York reviewers took exception to the play, several called Ms. Mol's work the freshest of the evening.</p>
        <p>If it is the actor's eternal quest to be noticed, Ms. Finneran, Ms. Mol and Ms. Coolidge come to this moment from different points in the search. Ms. Mol, 29, for instance, appeared twice on the cover of Vanity Fair in 1998 (by herself and in a group shot of rising young Hollywood actors), and Ms. Coolidge, who is in her late 30's, is a sought-after comedian for supporting roles in mainstream fare like ''American Pie.'' Ms. Finneran, on the other hand, has had only bit parts in movies -- unless you count her starring role in a 1990 remake of ''Night of the Living Dead,'' in which she played the ingénue Judy Rose (''I blow up in a truck,'' she said proudly).</p>
        <p>Over soup and salad during separate interviews in Manhattan, all three actresses talked of the unexpected pleasures of a juicy role, of the physical toll exacted by eight performances a week, of the extraordinary serenity when a part feels right. ''It's very strange, but you can actually feel when an audience is with you,'' said Ms. Mol, who lives in Manhattan and is making her New York stage debut. For Ms. Coolidge, a longtime member of the Groundlings, a Los Angeles comedy group, the storm came before the calm: never having done an extended run in a straight play, she was terrified that she did not have the stamina. ''It's like you have a very big term paper every day,'' she said.</p>
        <p>What makes a terrific performance terrific? Ms. Finneran answered a question with a question. ''Where are the parts that are this funny?'' she said, nibbling on a shrimp cocktail. In ''Noises Off,'' a sex farce-within-a-farce about a bumbling theatrical troupe, her Brooke is the dishy blonde whose way of dealing with onstage disaster is to continue her line readings as if nothing is going wrong. The antics in this rigorously gymnastic comedy look dangerous -- Ms. Finneran has to walk headlong into walls and doors -- and she has the wounds to show for it.</p>
        <p>''This is where I fell down the ladder one day,'' she said, pointing to an angry bruise on her leg. Having appeared on Broadway any number of times, in everything from ''Cabaret,'' as a replacement Sally Bowles, to ''The Iceman Cometh'' with Kevin Spacey, Ms. Finneran is no longer starry-eyed about the stage, although she set her sights on it before she had ever seen a play anywhere but on television. ''Always Broadway,'' she said. Arriving in New York a decade ago after dropping out of Carnegie Mellon's acting program, she enrolled in Uta Hagen's classes at HB Studios and began finding work almost immediately.</p>
        <p>In ''Noises Off,'' it was not until she got into rehearsal with the rest of the cast and Jeremy Sams, the director, that she understood how funny Brooke could be. ''The first rehearsal, I read her as dumb as a board,'' she said. Mr. Sams told her to go further. ''Jeremy's greatest note to me was to make her the greatest actress that she can be.''</p>
        <p>''People see her as a dumb blonde,'' Ms. Finneran added. ''But now I think she is just thinking about things that are more interesting than what's going on.''</p>
        <p>An element of deceptive vacancy has always figured in the success of Ms. Coolidge. ''Something about me looks like I lack intelligence,'' she said. ''I could always see people talking to me like I'm an idiot.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Women'' Ms. Coolidge plays Edith Potter, who is more bewildered than stupid. She is a walking sight gag: while the play unfolds over the course of several years, Edith is pregnant in virtually every scene. Ms. Coolidge is a whiz at registering a kind of alarmed disgust at Edith's predicament; in what is arguably the production's funniest moment, Ms. Coolidge is the picture of unmotherliness: propped up in a bed in a maternity wing, and smoking, she is so unconscious of the precious bundle in her arms that she -- well, it would be unfair to give it away.</p>
        <p>Years of improvisational comedy seem to have unlocked her wilder impulses. She likens what she does in Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 play to the outrages committed by the women in ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' the successful British sitcom about a pair of carousing middle-aged women. ''No matter how far I went with it, Scott never said, 'You went too far,' '' Ms. Coolidge said, referring to the play's director, Scott Elliott.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Finneran, Ms. Coolidge started by waiting on tables and taking drama classes in New York. ''I was the cocktail waitress and Sandra Bullock was the hostess,'' said the actress, who grew up in Boston. Her acting teacher was the actress and playwright Julie Bovasso, though Ms. Coolidge soon discovered she wasn't destined to be the class pet. ''She kept rewarding people who cried,'' Ms. Coolidge recalled of Bovasso. And the student who did reap the raves? ''She was like a faucet.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Mol, ''The Shape of Things'' was a return to a classroom. ''There's really something playful about this material,'' she said on a recent afternoon at a cafe a few blocks from the Promenade. ''It was so much fun. You're really finding the life of this thing, together.''</p>
        <p>Her character, Jenny, is timid in comparison to Ms. Weisz's volatile Evelyn, who sets in motion the events that lead to a humiliating denouement for one of the men in the play. ''She's struggling to find her own voice,'' Ms. Mol said of her character. ''There are moments, little glimpses, where you see that she looks up to Evelyn, even though she's intimidated and envious of someone who can be so black and white.''</p>
        <p>In his review of the play, Mr. Brantley said an audience feels disproportionately for Ms. Mol's Jenny because ''she seems to be entirely there, in the present tense.'' Ms. Mol explained that she felt an instant rapport with her character. ''I had a lot of her in me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then again, playing a part for months, an actress can begin to second-guess herself. ''Sometimes I'm like, 'Who is she?' '' she said. '' 'I'm doing it all wrong. Now I'm playing down to her.' It depends on the night.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mol, who grew up in eastern Connecticut, was determined to be an actress from early childhood. The Goodspeed Opera House was nearby, and when she was 10, she told a teacher that she wanted to audition for the musical ''Annie,'' which was being performed there. ''He looked at me like he was charmed,'' she said, ''but I was like, 'I'm serious!' ''</p>
        <p>In the end, she did not try out. But the bug had bitten. Years later, she would study at a professional school in New York, the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, and after several years in television and film, finally return to New York, overcoming her nerves about whether she would be any good onstage. With Mr. LaBute's play, and the accompanying praise, the anxiety has eased.</p>
        <p>''To me, that was a big accomplishment,'' she said. ''To face those fears.''</p>
        <p>All three actresses seem to be enjoying their moment, even if they know it cannot last. There is inevitably the project after the current one to worry about, and the reality of having to prove themselves all over again. As Ms. Finneran put it, ''I live my life by plays -- play to play to play.''</p>
