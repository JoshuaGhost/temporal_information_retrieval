        <p>Mary Jane Himes needed some onions for the chicken française she was whipping up the other night. For a split second, she figured she could pop down to the Grand Union supermarket at Northern Boulevard and Marathon Parkway, a block from her home.</p>
        <p>Then she remembered. The store had closed more than a year ago, leaving a neighborhood that once had two supermarkets with none. And despite an energetic lobbying campaign by Ms. Himes and her neighbors, the Stop 'n' Shop supermarket chain, which holds a long-term lease on the vacant building, had not opened a replacement.</p>

        <p>Mary Jane Himes needed some onions for the chicken française she was whipping up the other night. For a split second, she figured she could pop down to the Grand Union supermarket at Northern Boulevard and Marathon Parkway, a block from her home.</p>
        <p>Then she remembered. The store had closed more than a year ago, leaving a neighborhood that once had two supermarkets with none. And despite an energetic lobbying campaign by Ms. Himes and her neighbors, the Stop 'n' Shop supermarket chain, which holds a long-term lease on the vacant building, had not opened a replacement.</p>
        <p>''I'm lucky I have a car,'' Ms. Himes said. ''I drove the eight or nine blocks to a new greengrocer to pick up the onions. But we have a lot of old-timers in the neighborhood who really relied on that supermarket, and this is hitting them very hard.''</p>
        <p>Little Neck, Queens, a community of single-family homes with about 15,000 people, sits on either side of Northern Boulevard, its main shopping strip, and many residents can walk to local stores. The Grand Union closed when that company went bankrupt in October 2000, after which Stop 'n' Shop acquired the site. The building is shuttered, though its distinctive green awning remains.</p>
        <p>''It casts a shadow over the town,'' Ms. Himes, a lifelong Little Neck resident, said of the vacant structure. When she was growing up in the neighborhood in the 1950's, there was both an A.&amp; P. and a Bohack.</p>
        <p>Ms. Himes and her neighbors had hoped Stop 'n' Shop would open one of its own stores on the site. In September, working with the Little Neck Pines Association, she and others began a petition and letter-writing campaign to force the issue.</p>
        <p>State Senator Frank Padavan, who supports the campaign, said residents sent so many letters, petitions and e-mail messages that the company asked them to stop. Several hundred residents also filled out a Stop 'n' Shop survey to assess the need for a supermarket in the area.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood's answer was clear, Mr. Padavan said: ''There is a large unmet need that could be very profitable for whoever meets it.''</p>
        <p>Faith Weiner, the director of communications for Stop 'n' Shop, said the response to the survey had been overwhelming.  She said the company was studying ways to open a new store on the Little Neck site.</p>
        <p>''The supermarket has always been a hub of activity and a socializing spot,'' Ms. Himes said. ''We want it back.''</p>
