        <p>When they met a month ago, the Knicks viewed it as just another game. They knew that the Nets had improved, that it would take a strong effort to defeat them. But the matchup was not personal. The thought of beating the Nets did not provoke an adrenaline rush.</p>

        <p>When they met a month ago, the Knicks viewed it as just another game. They knew that the Nets had improved, that it would take a strong effort to defeat them. But the matchup was not personal. The thought of beating the Nets did not provoke an adrenaline rush.</p>
        <p>The Knicks saved those emotions for teams like Miami, Toronto and the Los Angeles Lakers. They scoffed at the news media's implications of a Knicks-Nets rivalry, asserting that an intense playoff series or two was necessary for that. They looked upon Jason Kidd's prediction that the Nets would soon supplant them as the area's top team with amusement, saying they had bigger plans beyond maintaining the metropolitan area's imaginary crown.</p>
        <p>But then the Nets embarrassed them in a barrage of blocked shots and windmill dunks, and Kidd established himself as the area's best player, dominating so thoroughly that it seemed as if he could take four anybodies and beat the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the matchup began to feel like a real rivalry. Suddenly, it had juice. Suddenly, the rematch became something to look forward to. That game is here.</p>
        <p>The Knicks (11-12) play the Nets (14-7) tonight at Madison Square Garden, and this time the more storied ball club is the one with something to prove.</p>
        <p>''I think it's going to be a pretty emotional game,'' Knicks guard Allan Houston said. ''It's going to be a game where we want to protect our home court. They beat us pretty bad and made us look pretty bad, so we do have that still fresh on our minds.''</p>
        <p>It must be a tormenting thought because that game Nov. 16 was the Knicks' worst of the season, a 26-point thrashing that was competitive only briefly in the third quarter. To make matters worse, the new-breed Nets, led by Kidd in the backcourt and the audacious Kenyon Martin in the frontcourt, disrespected the Knicks while stomping them, gloating and talking trash on the court.</p>
        <p>''I hope guys took the last game against them personally because they did talk a lot of trash and they backed it up,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who scored 25 points that game and was the only Knicks starter to play well. ''So I feel like it's a game that we should be ready for.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks' approach is not the only factor that could change the result of this game. In November, the Knicks were not whole. Marcus Camby was out with a foot injury, and the Nets took advantage, attacking the rim without fear and destroying the Knicks on the boards. But with Camby back, the Knicks are better equipped to compete inside.</p>
        <p>''I'm ready,'' Camby said. ''I remember all the hoopla and all the trash-talking they were doing in the papers. But it's a different ballgame now. We're back to being healthy. We have all our guys.''</p>
        <p>Camby, who is averaging 11.8 points and 13.6 rebounds, also believes the game has some social significance, noting that both teams are led by African-American coaches, Don Chaney of the Knicks and Byron Scott of the Nets.</p>
        <p>But it will take more than Camby's mere presence to lift the Knicks over the Nets, who have won four of their last five. After winning five of their first six games with Camby, the Knicks have lost three in a row. The first two games, an overtime loss to Boston and a 2-point loss to Detroit, could have easily gone their way, but on Friday the Knicks were routed, 96-80, by the Washington Wizards.</p>
        <p>Afterward, some of the starters questioned Chaney's decision to sit them down for the fourth quarter. ''The last two losses on the road have definitely been frustrating,'' Camby said, ''so hopefully we can come back home and get regrouped.''</p>
        <p>Since taking over four games ago, Chaney has promoted an up-tempo style, but trying to run with the Nets could prove disastrous. While he wants his players to push the ball upcourt, Chaney does not want an all-out track meet.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were blown away by the Nets' fast break in the last meeting and anything less than significant improvement in their transition defense will spell doom. Putting Sprewell on Kidd could slow down the Nets' offense, but Chaney would not say whether he will make that adjustment.</p>
        <p>''It's not really stopping Kidd, it's stopping the other guys from running with him by getting back,'' Chaney said. ''When the ball is missed, we have to make sure we get back and protect, because he's pushing it and the other guys are running with him. We have to make sure we get back and protect the paint.''</p>
        <p>Without protecting the paint, the Knicks will not be able to protect the Garden floor. Or the area's imaginary crown.</p>
