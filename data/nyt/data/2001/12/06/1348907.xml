        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Security Council welcomed the news today that their special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, had succeeded in brokering an agreement among anti-Taliban Afghans to form a transitional ruling council. But the tricky issue of a multinational security force remained subject to further discussion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, who will be in Oslo on Monday to receive the Nobel Peace Prize he shared this year with the United Nations as a whole, described the agreement, reached in Bonn, as an ''important first step.''</p>
        <p>''Now that they have agreed on the interim administration, I would expect them to go back to Kabul and work very, very closely together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Security Council met with Mr. Annan in a closed session this afternoon to discuss the agreement. The Council is expected to vote on Thursday to approve a resolution presented by Britain and France endorsing the agreement and reaffirming ''full support'' for Mr. Brahimi, but leaving the issue of an interim force for the future.</p>
        <p>According to the agreement, a 30-member interim authority composed of the major ethnic groups in Afghanistan in rough proportion to their population will take power in Kabul on Dec. 22.</p>
        <p>The United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said the organization had tried to work out 11 seats for the Pashtuns, 8 for the Tajiks, 5 for the Hazaras, 3 for the Uzbeks and 1 or 2 for smaller groups.</p>
        <p>The chairman will be Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun hereditary leader who was deputy foreign minister in the pre-Taliban government. Northern Alliance leaders will be in charge of defense, foreign affairs and the interior, and the authority will include two women.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Eckhard noted that the issue of a peacekeeping force remained ''a matter of concern.''</p>
        <p>''We are working against a deadline of Dec. 22, when we hope the security arrangements will not only be agreed on, but will be deployed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Though there is broad agreement that a multinational force is essential to help establish security first in Kabul and then in other areas, the United States has been reluctant to introduce a sizable foreign army while it is still hunting down the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The force is also opposed by some elements of the Northern Alliance, who would have to cede some of the control they have gained in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Diplomats said discussions on the issue would begin immediately, with the possibility of deploying at least a modest force soon. Abdullah Abdullah, the foreign minister in the new administration, has said the force may initially be as small as 200, far smaller than the force of several thousand that Britain and France originally envisaged.</p>
        <p>Among countries that have been mentioned for the coalition are Britain, France, Germany, Turkey and Jordan. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that Bangladesh and Indonesia were also interested.</p>
        <p>''I'll be doing a little collection-plate banging over the next day or two,'' he said, to raise money for the force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brahimi himself said he would head for Rome to see the former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who has been considered a unifying symbol in a future Afghan government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brahimi said he would also meet with Burhanuddin Rabbani, the former Afghan president, who until today was still recognized by the United Nations as the head of state and who was said to have delayed progress at the talks in Bonn.</p>
        <p>Diplomats said the new Afghan coalition would now take the Afghan seat at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Establishing some form of internal security has been given added urgency by the onset of winter, which has made it even more difficult for the United Nations to deliver aid.</p>
