      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For three-quarters of a century Franco Alfano has been remembered as the man who made a bad job of finishing Puccini's ''Turandot.'' That judgment is probably unfair, since ultimate responsibility for what became the standard edition rested with the original conductor, Toscanini. Friday night's performance by Teatro Grattacielo, a New York company, of Alfano's ''Risurrezione,'' however, suggested that this was a composer with a supreme aptitude for the uninteresting.</p>
        <p>The score is bleached Puccini: no tunes, no characterization, no local color, no fierce grip of the music on the action -- indeed, no grip at all. Events move on, and the tidal sway of harmonically rich music continues. There is, though, more finesse in the scoring than the ''Turandot'' finale would lead one to suppose, with some nice viola solos and passages for divided cellos, and a quasi-fugue on low wind instruments at one point.</p>

        <p>For three-quarters of a century Franco Alfano has been remembered as the man who made a bad job of finishing Puccini's ''Turandot.'' That judgment is probably unfair, since ultimate responsibility for what became the standard edition rested with the original conductor, Toscanini. Friday night's performance by Teatro Grattacielo, a New York company, of Alfano's ''Risurrezione,'' however, suggested that this was a composer with a supreme aptitude for the uninteresting.</p>
        <p>The score is bleached Puccini: no tunes, no characterization, no local color, no fierce grip of the music on the action -- indeed, no grip at all. Events move on, and the tidal sway of harmonically rich music continues. There is, though, more finesse in the scoring than the ''Turandot'' finale would lead one to suppose, with some nice viola solos and passages for divided cellos, and a quasi-fugue on low wind instruments at one point.</p>
        <p>Such moments were well served in this performance. The Teatro Grattacielo Orchestra may be a rough-and-ready band, but Fiora Contino's conducting is expert, and the music was delivered with precise discipline and forthrightly.</p>
        <p>There was some fine singing, too. The baritone Michael Corvino used grave tone and urgent yet supple phrasing to give a convincing charge to Simonson's late appearance as the savior of the heroine, Katiusha. His big number thrust the opera, briefly, into the real world. Michele Fiammardente brought an eager and stylish Italianate tenor sound to the rather disparate role of Dimitri. Virginia Dupuy was a firm and glowing mezzo in two small parts that gained from her authoritative poise. There was also excellent work from Jennifer Tiller -- another mezzo, agile and expressive -- and from the strong young baritone Joshua Benaim.</p>
        <p>In the central role of Katiusha, Allison Charney looked wonderful and produced the right sort of fresh, vulnerable sound, but she was having trouble with intonation.</p>
