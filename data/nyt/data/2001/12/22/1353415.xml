        <p>''Follow the lady in the blue burka.''</p>
        <p>It is not the usual instruction given to New York City police officers and firefighters, but this was hardly the usual expedition. Four firefighters and two police officers arrived at an orphanage in Kabul today, where they greeted children and were taken to tea by the woman in the blue burka. By afternoon, they were on their way back to New York.</p>
        <p>The group came on a cargo plane that also carried 90,000 pounds of emergency aid for the Afghan people, mostly food and blankets.</p>
        <p>One of the group, Firefighter Joseph Higgins, 40, also left behind a few pieces of the World Trade Center, including one that he buried at Bagram air base, just north of here. In doing so, he made plain how the attacks on America forged a chain that may not easily be broken. It brought American bombs raining down here, American soldiers on the ground here, and American pledges of money for reconstruction.</p>
        <p>And it brought Firefighter Higgins to the place that gave sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, who has been blamed for the plot that killed his brother, Lt. Timothy Higgins, a firefighter who died when the World Trade Center fell. Joseph Higgins pulled his brother's body out of that wreckage.</p>
        <p>He came bearing gifts to show the Afghan people the humane side of Americans but also, he said, to boost the morale of the soldiers who have taken on Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda, and their Taliban protectors.</p>
        <p>Among the troops who greeted the arriving plane at Bagram were 10 or 12 members of the Special Forces, who usually remain hidden even to their fellow soldiers. The Special Forces soldiers have adopted local styles so completely that when the arriving New Yorkers saw them on the tarmac, with full beards and Afghan dress and tans, they mistook the troops for Afghans.</p>
        <p>But soon they were ''like a bunch of guys sitting around a bar,'' said Police Officer Jose R. Guerra, albeit a sad one. They swapped stories of rescue work at ground zero and of calling in air strikes in Afghanistan. Firefighter Higgins gave one soldier a chunk of trade center concrete, and another, a bracelet engraved with his brother's name.</p>
        <p>Later in the morning, the group, whose trip was sponsored by Guinness/UDV, drove from Bagram to Kabul, passing through a plain where village after village had been by the Taliban or in the internecine fighting that preceded their harsh rule.</p>
        <p>More startling than the ruins, said Lawrence Connors, 54, who serves at  the Fire Department installation at Fort Totten, was that he saw people still living there.</p>
        <p>''I was in Vietnam in infantry,'' he said, ''and I didn't see the type of devastation I saw here.''</p>
        <p>Then they entered a Kabul that is both ravaged and vibrant, driving past butchered carcasses hanging in the market, piles of cauliflower and hand-painted signs.</p>
        <p>They drove through one of the city's most devastated neighborhoods, Alaoodin, where factional fighting in 1992 left little more than the stumps of buildings behind, and arrived at the orphanage.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of children with unwashed faces and old eyes and undimmed smiles were waiting for them. They made Firefighter Higgins think of the children who lost parents Sept. 11, including his brother's three teenagers. ''They should have love, they should have care, they should have the necessities of life,'' he said, and added: ''I'm never going to complain again.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Donald Hayde played with a baby in the sun. He is a battalion chief with the Fire Department's Special Operations Command. Until last year, he was the commander of Squad 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which lost 12 firefighters on Sept. 11.</p>
        <p>He came to Afghanistan because he ''felt the urge,'' he said, and was wishing he could spend more time in Kabul. But there was a plane waiting to take him back this afternoon, and two more funerals to attend at home.</p>
