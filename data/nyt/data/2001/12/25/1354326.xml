        <p>Canada's real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in October, helped by retail sales and home construction, Statistics Canada said. The increase, the first monthly advance since May, exceeded economists' expectations and compared with a 0.8 percent decline in September. But Statistics Canada cautioned that the underlying weakness in the economy persisted in October. Output of computers and electronics slid 2.7 percent, the 14th monthly decline in a row. Communications equipment output was down 9.3 percent. Retail sales climbed 2.3 percent in October, due mostly to a 3.6 percent jump in motor vehicle sales.  In manufacturing, 10 of 21 sectors advanced, accounting for 62 percent of production.</p>
