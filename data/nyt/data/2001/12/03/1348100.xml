        <p>After months of negotiations led by American and British diplomats, Turkish government officials announced tonight that they had broken the deadlock in talks over the creation of a European security force.

        <p>Turkey has insisted on having a decision-making role in the proposed 60,000-member European Union security force, especially as it applies to the use of the resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Turkey is a member of NATO and a candidate for membership in the European Union.

        <p>After months of negotiations led by American and British diplomats, Turkish government officials announced tonight that they had broken the deadlock in talks over the creation of a European security force. The issue has increasingly roiled this country's relationship with the European Union, an organization that Turkey wants to join.</p>
        <p>Turkey has insisted on having a decision-making role in the proposed 60,000-member European Union security force, especially as it applies to the use of the resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Turkey is a member of NATO and a candidate for membership in the European Union. Turkey's demands have been the chief stumbling block to the creation of the security force.</p>
        <p>A statement from the office of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said an agreement had been reached to allow cooperation between NATO and the European Union. Turkish government officials offered no other comment. But whatever the details of the agreement, it has yet to win the approval of the 15-member European Union. The organization is scheduled to meet later this month to begin setting up the security force, scheduled to be in place by 2003.</p>
        <p>''The three-party talks form a concrete basis that will provide an opportunity to take relations between the E.U. and NATO forward in every field,'' read the statement, issued today after the prime minister, his cabinet and senior military officials ended their meeting.</p>
        <p>Turkey worries that the European Union, which includes its rival, Greece, would use the proposed force against its interests, namely, on the divided island of Cyprus in the Aegean Sea. Turkey has sought to participate in the decisions. For their part, the Europeans have rejected giving Turkey an automatic seat at the table. Rather, the European Union has said Turkey and other nonmember states would be consulted on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>Turkey's intransigence on the issue emerged in recent weeks as the chief symbol of tensions with the European Union. ''It's a matter of extreme, extreme distrust,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Bilgi University here. ''The British and the Americans have tried very hard to reach a compromise.''</p>
        <p>British and American diplomats have held three meetings in Ankara in recent months to work out a solution, and the matter is expected to be on the agenda during Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit this week. The United States has a stake in this fight: it prefers that the would-be European force use NATO resources rather than create a separate military unit.</p>
        <p>Turkey has already been assured that the European Union force will not intervene in the political disputes of NATO allies, like the Greek-Turkish standoff over Cyprus.</p>
        <p>The Dutch foreign minister, Jozias van Aartsen, and Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium, who currently presides over the European Union, met senior Turkish officials last week to try to iron out a deal.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 8, 2001, Saturday  An article last Monday about Turkey's announcement of an agreement on the formation of a European Union security force misstated the location of Cyprus, whose partial occupation by Turkey since 1974 is a source of tension with Greece, a European Union member. It is in the Mediterranean, not the Aegean.</p>
