        <p>NEXT year is supposed to be the culmination of a five-year plan to reduce the average time it takes the Patent and Trademark Office to process a patent application to 18 months from the current 24. The agency is not likely to make it.</p>
        <p>Bringing down that ''patent pending'' time is one of the goals that the new director of patents and trademarks inherited when he started his job this month. James E. Rogan, a former Republican representative from Southern California, was sworn in on Dec. 10 as Under Secretary of Commerce for intellectual property and director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
        <p>Heading the patent agency is a political appointment, and it took President Bush more than a year to clear the way for Mr. Rogan to replace Nicholas P. Godici, the career agency official who had been acting director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogan is surely aware that in spite of an official goal announced in 1998 to reduce patent processing time to a year and a half, the pending time has climbed slowly and steadily the last decade.</p>
        <p>Having come to his new job from Congress, he also knows that the agency's ability to improve depends on how much money it can wrest from Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing for me is to ensure that the patent and trademark office has the funds it needs for its people to do their jobs,'' Mr. Rogan said in a recent interview. ''In the 21st century, so much technology is so highly sophisticated that we can't allow patent applications to sit around for two or three years.''</p>
        <p>But they do. The last time the average patent-pending period was close to 18 months was in 1991, when it hit 18.2. It hovered around 19 months through 1995, and then began climbing -- to 20 months in 1996 and 22 months in 1997. By 1998, when the five-year plan began, it had reached 24 months.</p>
        <p>A year later it was 25 months, and in 2000 it settled at slightly more than 24.</p>
        <p>Patent officials offer two main reasons for the lengthening of pending time -- a significant increase in the number and complexity of patent applications in the 1990's, and not enough money in the agency's budget to hire and train examiners to keep up with the demand.</p>
        <p>''In some of my briefing materials, I was stunned to read that one patent application arrived with 12 CD's,'' Mr. Rogan said.</p>
        <p>''That's the equivalent of six million pages of data,'' he added. ''I don't think people in Congress fail to understand the importance of patents, but they may fail to understand the complexity of what comes through the door here and what is involved in going through a patent application.</p>
        <p>''We need more patent examiners, we need more funds,'' he added. ''We'll never decrease the patent pendency time with fewer examiners or with less experienced examiners because of turnover.''</p>
        <p>In 2000, the patent office took in nearly 312,000 applications, 75 percent more than the 178,000 received in 1991. The growth came mainly in high-technology inventions involving computers, telecommunications and biotechnology. In the early 1990's, for example, overall patent applications increased about 2 percent a year on average while biotechnology applications grew 11 percent annually.</p>
        <p>Still, the agency alone is not responsible for the time it takes to process an application. Inventors have three to six months to respond to inquiries from examiners. The longer it takes an inventor to respond, the longer it will take the patent office to decide on an application. Nevertheless, in 1999 the agency needed an average of 13.5 months to take its first action on 81 percent of applications, up sharply from 1993, when the first action usually came after 7.5 months.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that there are not enough examiners to keep up with the workload. The agency employs 3,000 examiners today, but says it needs to hire 700 more next year.</p>
        <p>The examiners it has now are called on to analyze invention categories that hardly existed 10 years ago. During the 1990's, companies began to view patents as capital assets.</p>
        <p>That was particularly true in the dot-com world, where a patent was often a start-up company's only asset. At the height of the Internet frenzy, the key to attracting capital was often to show potential investors a patent as evidence of a marketable product or service. As a result, the patent agency began to see many more applications for inventions involving biotechnology, software and computer-related products, telecommunications, and especially, business methods.</p>
        <p>Debates arose over patents for business methods because many people argued that simply applying a common or traditional business practice to the Internet did not qualify it for a patent. Critics of software-related and business methods patents accused the agency of using poorly trained examiners with meager resources to evaluate such applications. They said the examiners did not know and were unable to discover that many applications were for innovations that researchers, academics and pioneers in computer fields had been using for years.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the agency was having a hard time keeping its examiners. With the boom in intellectual property professions, trained examiners with a couple of years of experience could easily find higher-paying jobs in the private sector. Attrition among examiners was 14 percent in 2000.</p>
        <p>The agency seems to have stanched that flow with special legislation that allows it to give 10 percent raises to examiners who switch to electronic processing from paper. Attrition has dropped to 8 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Automation of the entire patent application system is a central tactic in the agency's effort to reduce pending time. It already accepts patent and trademark applications online. But the next stages of the process are often still handled with paper copies, color-coded files and conventional mail. That includes what the agency calls ''office actions'' -- the queries and documents sent by an examiner to an inventor, and the inventor's responses or amendments.</p>
        <p>The agency plans to computerize the entire process. In 2001, it spent $240 million on having the project started, and it expects to spend about the same next year.</p>
        <p>The agency's total budget for 2002 is $1.1 billion. How long it will take to complete the automation project depends on how much money the agency gets from Congress for 2003.</p>
        <p>The hefty user fees charged by the Patent and Trademark Office would pay for the agency, but Congress takes that money and gives only a portion of it back to the agency. The rest is funneled elsewhere in the federal government. Every year, patent agency leaders fight to keep as much of the fees as possible.</p>
        <p>Still, automating the patent application system will help trim pending time only so much. Each application must be evaluated by a live expert -- a patent examiner who specializes in mechanical, electrical or chemical engineering.</p>
        <p>''It's an intellectual exercise,'' said Brigid Quinn, the agency's deputy director for public affairs. ''There's only so much that can be automated. So far, nobody has come up with the invention that can do that critical process.''</p>
