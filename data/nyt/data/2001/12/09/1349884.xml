        <p>TAIWAN has led a separate existence since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces fled there in 1949 after being routed by Mao Zedong's Communists. But in the last year, it began to tilt perceptibly toward its giant neighbor, China.</p>
        <p>The first evidence was economic. The island's computer industry transferred so much of its production to China that one-quarter of desktop PC's and half of monitors produced by Taiwanese companies are now manufactured on the mainland. Taiwanese companies have invested an estimated $60 billion in China. More than 30,000 companies have plants there, while 300,000 Taiwanese live in Shanghai alone.</p>
        <p>And, in keeping with what many people take to be a modern rule of thumb, where economic interests lay, political momentum seemed likely to follow.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government, ready to reap political dividends from the flow of Taiwanese dollars, spent months cultivating Taiwan's Nationalist Party, inviting its top officials to Beijing, where they toasted warmer ties across the Taiwan Strait. Chen Shui-bian, the opposition leader who uprooted the Nationalists from the presidency last year, was isolated and swamped by a dismal economy.</p>
        <p>There were signs, too, that Taiwan's 23 million people were more open to tying their political future to Beijing. Several polls last summer showed a spike in support for ''one country, two systems,'' the arrangement under which China took possession of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997. The unification of Taiwan and China, long unthinkable, began to seem inevitable.</p>
        <p>Yet when voters in Taiwan went to the polls on Dec. 1 to elect a new Legislature, they shattered that expectation -- and raised new questions about the relationship between economic and political ties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party, which formally advocates an independent Taiwan, swept to a landslide victory, largely at the expense of the Nationalists, who had ruled the island for 55 years until they were defeated by Mr. Chen in March 2000. The Nationalists, who had kept control of the Legislature, lost 42 seats, and their majority, in the 225-seat chamber.</p>
        <p>China might be an attractive place to put up a factory, the voters seemed to be saying, but that does not make it the motherland.</p>
        <p>''Economic integration does not make a political solution inevitable,'' said William C. Kirby, the director of the Asia Center at Harvard University. ''You can have fantastic amounts of social and economic integration, a great cross-strait intermingling, without a political relationship.''</p>
        <p>That recognition would be a bitter disappointment for China. It has pushed for more commercial ties between Taiwan and China on the principle that political ties will follow. Driven by the need to stay competitive, few Taiwanese companies have been able to resist its vast market and cheap labor.</p>
        <p>''The center of gravity has shifted to China,'' said Morris Chang, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. ''I wish they would go away, but they're not going away. For Taiwan, it would be best to have a hand in it.''</p>
        <p>OF course, the jury is not in with the final verdict. Some people still think that eventually Taiwan will have such a hand in China that its leaders will no longer be able to resist Beijing. Chinese leaders dangle the prospect of direct trade and transportation links -- provided, of course, that Mr. Chen recognize the principle of a single China, governed by Beijing.</p>
        <p>China's blueprint is Hong Kong. The former colony became economically intertwined with the mainland years before its political status changed. By the time Britain tried to implant democracy, Hong Kong's tycoons were so heavily invested across the border that they were loath to offend Beijing.</p>
        <p>Taiwan is not Hong Kong, however. Democracy has taken firm root on the island, and with it has come a growing sense of autonomy. Far from being bullied by China, voters in Taiwan delight in supporting the candidates least liked by Beijing. When China's leaders warned that electing Mr. Chen would raise tensions, it turned out to be his most valuable endorsement.</p>
        <p>Voters in Taiwan have discovered that they can thumb their noses at China while still building factories there. Beijing has refused to negotiate with Mr. Chen, yet this chilly period has coincided with a surge in projects.</p>
        <p>Likewise, commerce does not prevent political disputes. Europe was economically integrated before World War I, Professor Kirby noted, but that did not prevent the outbreak of hostilities. As in prewar Europe, there are deep historical reasons for the gulf between Taiwan and China -- which cannot be papered over by a new chip factory or a healthy balance of trade.  T AIWAN'S political existence will be decided at the end of the day by politicians,'' Professor Kirby said. ''If they lose their political will to exist, it will bring about the end. But we're a long way from that.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps even further, after this last election.</p>
