        <p>The biggest news in the book world this year -- before Jonathan Franzen was K.O.'d by Oprah Winfrey, anyway -- was that Fay Weldon, the sardonic British novelist, had been paid by the Italian jewelry company Bulgari to write a novel celebrating its products. (Weldon didn't try to hide anything; she called her book ''The Bulgari Connection.'') The literary world's moralists were, predictably, outraged. But the biggest surprise about the reaction to ''The Bulgari Connection'' may be that anyone was all that surprised.</p>
        <p>Weldon's novel landed at a moment when this country's most popular storytellers -- that is, the makers of TV shows and movies -- were rapidly moving beyond mere product placement. In the era of TiVo, the device that allows viewers to fast-forward through commercials, companies like Bulgari are increasingly bypassing traditional advertising agencies and jumping directly into the ''content'' business themselves. BMW hired big-name directors like Ang Lee and Guy Ritchie to make short movies that you can download from its Web site; the company's cars are central to the plot of each film, of course. Nike commissioned a cycling documentary that was shown on CBS. And a soon-to-be-broadcast reality show on the WB network will be called ''No Boundaries'' -- a title that also happens to be the slogan for a line of Ford S.U.V.'s that will be prominently featured in the show. Ford provided seed money to get the program off the ground, an act that gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ''No Boundaries.''</p>

        <p>Weldon's novel landed at a moment when this country's most popular storytellers -- that is, the makers of TV shows and movies -- were rapidly moving beyond mere product placement. In the era of TiVo, the device that allows viewers to fast-forward through commercials, companies like Bulgari are increasingly bypassing traditional advertising agencies and jumping directly into the ''content'' business themselves. BMW hired big-name directors like Ang Lee and Guy Ritchie to make short movies that you can download from its Web site; the company's cars are central to the plot of each film, of course. Nike commissioned a cycling documentary that was shown on CBS. And a soon-to-be-broadcast reality show on the WB network will be called ''No Boundaries'' -- a title that also happens to be the slogan for a line of Ford S.U.V.'s that will be prominently featured in the show.

        <p>If this trend has an upside, it's that viewers will have to sit through fewer commercials; the downside, of course, is that the programs will actually be commercials, more or less. Which brings us back to Fay Weldon. Her book, it turns out, was originally meant to be little more than a cool party favor -- Bulgari paid her an undisclosed sum to write the novel, and it printed up 7,500 copies and gave them to guests at a formal dinner. The company ended up getting both more and less than it paid for. The book won a wider audience when Weldon's British and American publishers realized that ''The Bulgari Connection'' was pretty good and decided to issue it, too. But you didn't have to be Lionel Trilling to realize that Weldon was being as mischievous as she has been in her 21 previous novels. In her novel, the character who lusts after a glittering Bulgari necklace (a perky TV journalist) is depicted as both shallow and vain -- imagine MSNBC's Ashleigh Banfield combined with Tonya Harding -- and she eventually gets her comeuppance. The next time Bulgari is looking for no boundaries, it may want to get into the sitcom business instead.</p>
