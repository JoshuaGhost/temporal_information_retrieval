        <p>Rockefeller Center says Christmas in New York with its tree, skating rink, shopping and the Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall. But on Sunday, when New Yorkers have more time for such activities, many of the restaurants in the area are not open. Here are six that do.</p>
        <p>CITARELLA  THE RESTAURANT ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 332-1515; 1240 Avenue of the Americas (49th Street); $$$$; Review: 10/3/01.</p>
        <p>Fish is the big item at Citarella the Restaurant, a long-awaited spinoff of Citarella, the grocery and fish store on the Upper West and Upper East Sides. The menu includes a grudging concession to carnivores, a plain steak with potatoes, but as the Mermaid Moderne décor by David Rockwell suggests, Citarella is a seafood shrine, with Brian Young, formerly of Pop and Le Bernardin, its high priest. Sunday dinner is served.</p>

        <p>DISTRICT * [rating: one star]  (212) 485-2999; 130 West 46th Street  (near Broadway); $$$; Review: 1/10/01.</p>
        <p>District is witty, sophisticated and surprisingly cozy, especially if you land one of the wraparound booths. The food is rich, florid, over the top and, when it works, irresistible in a way that makes you feel vaguely guilty. Breakfast and dinner are served.</p>
        <p>MEDI * [rating: one star]  (212) 399-8888; 45 Rockefeller Plaza (50th Street); $$$$; Review: 9/19/01.</p>
        <p>Medi, a collaboration between the legendary Roger Vergé, the chef and owner of Moulin des Mougins in Provence, and Roberto Ruggeri, the president of the Bice chain, is open for Sunday brunch, 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and dinner. The dining room overlooks the Christmas tree, as does an outdoor terrace that is open in good weather.</p>
        <p>MORRELL WINE BAR  AND CAFE  (212) 262-7700; 1 Rockefeller Plaza (49th Street); $$$; Diner's Journal: 12/17/99.</p>
        <p>The Morrell cafe may be small, but the wine list is large. And the closet-sized kitchen somehow manages to send out satisfying, well-conceived dishes, with an eye on the wine list. Sunday brunch is served from noon to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>ROCK CENTER CAFE  (212) 332-7620; 20 West 50th Street (Rockefeller Plaza); $$; Diner's Journal: 4/7/00.</p>
        <p>Formerly the American Festival Cafe, this restaurant, which specializes in steak and pasta, is larger and more casual. It also shares a view with its sister restaurant, the Sea Grill, on the opposite end of the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Both restaurants are open for lunch and dinner.</p>
        <p>SHAAN ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 977-8400; 57 West 48th Street (between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas); $$$; Review: 9/2/94; article: 9/22/00.</p>
        <p>This Indian restaurant serves good food in a hushed marble atmosphere. The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner.</p>
