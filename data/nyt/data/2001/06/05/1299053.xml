        <p>Abigail Levine drew the audience into the La Guardia Concert Hall on Thursday night with ''Thru,'' a site-specific piece set to music by Evan O'Reilly. Fifteen dancers led the way through the halls of La Guardia High School, joyously taking over the stage at the end. The three dances that followed in the 2001 Graduation Dance Concert at La Guardia, the school that was the subject of the movie ''Fame,'' made even better use of the ebullient youthfulness as well as the impressive dance skills of their casts, in a program dedicated to the Denishawn dancer Jane Sherman.</p>
        <p>Matthew Neenan, like Ms. Levine a La Guardia graduate, mixed bouncy pure movement with sophisticated physical wit and fleeting dramatic gestures in ''Marsalis,'' performed to music by J. F. Fasch and Telemann recorded by Wynton Marsalis. Randy Castillo stood out in the cast of five, which also included Karen Guedez, Loni Landon, Emily Oldak and Fallon Preziotti.</p>

        <p>H. T. Chen poured 15 dancers onto the stage in ''Meditations of a Drunken Peacock,'' set to music by Bradley Kaus, in choreography that was excitingly punchy and inventive though somewhat long-winded. Mr. Chen's eye for subtle patterning and juxtaposition of ensembles was evident. Mouna Mills stood out here and throughout the evening for her focused, insouciant personal movement style.</p>
        <p>Pat Catterson drew stylish performances from a cast of 10 in ''The Ballroom,'' set to music by the Tango Project. The goofy piece got off to a slow start. But the second half was perfection, as Lisa Resuta and Matthew Hauer whirled expertly through the tango and a bit of polka around a Broadway dance chorus seated diagonally across the stage.</p>
        <p>Catherine Brikké created a fitfully enjoyable ballet hoedown for her 16 dancers in ''In a Summer Mood,'' set to bluegrass music. Elisa King's new ''Liberation Suite,'' set to a jazz score composed by Kurt Bacher and played live by the All-City High School Jazz Ensemble, gave 25 dancers a taste of the modern-dance clichés that lie ahead in their professional careers.</p>
        <p>Justin DiCioccio conducted the savvy musical ensemble.</p>
