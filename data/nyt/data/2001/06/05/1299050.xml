        <p>Thousands of people have volunteered to test AIDS vaccines. Some are gay, some straight. Many are perfectly healthy, though some act in ways that put them at risk of contracting H.I.V.</p>
        <p>They have signed up for studies requiring them to receive multiple injections, to swallow brews of genetically engineered bacteria carrying H.I.V. genes, or to endure rectal or vaginal application of vaccines.</p>

        <p>Thousands of people have volunteered to test AIDS vaccines. Some are gay, some straight. Many are perfectly healthy, though some act in ways that put them at risk of contracting H.I.V.</p>
        <p>They have signed up for studies requiring them to receive multiple injections, to swallow brews of genetically engineered bacteria carrying H.I.V. genes, or to endure rectal or vaginal application of vaccines.</p>
        <p>They have accepted the risk that the vaccines being tested, though they cannot cause H.I.V. infection, may cause a transient illness, sore arms or false positives on future AIDS tests. In addition to giving up countless hours and tubes of blood, volunteers have answered detailed questions about their sex lives and drug use and sat through lectures about safe sex.</p>
        <p>Why would anyone do this?</p>
        <p>Kathy McGuire, 33, an accountant in Baltimore, entered a study at Johns Hopkins University several years ago. ''I wanted my son to know it was normal to be doing things to help other people,'' she said. ''And I had recently come out myself as being gay, and it was something in the community.''</p>
        <p>She received a series of shots, with no ill effects other than a sore arm. At the end of the study, she found out that she had received the vaccine being studied and not a placebo. She has no regrets.</p>
        <p>Timothy Burton, 34, a journalist from Silver Spring, Md., also joined a Johns Hopkins study. ''As an African-American male who is H.I.V.-negative,'' he said, ''I have a responsibility for my African-American brothers and my gay brothers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton said he knew that medical researchers often had a hard time recruiting black volunteers for studies. He said he joined the vaccine trial over the protests of some family members, including his mother, who voiced deep distrust of medical experimentation and brought up the notorious Tuskegee study, in which black men with syphilis were deliberately left untreated.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Burton, who had lost a partner to AIDS, wanted to support the research. ''I thought, maybe this could be the answer,'' he said, ''and if it isn't, maybe it's a step to the answer. I wanted to be involved in the answer.''</p>
