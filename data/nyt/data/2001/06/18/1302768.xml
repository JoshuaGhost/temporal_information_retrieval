        <p>Larry Poulin drove Ziggy and Conyer to his sixth United States Equestrian Team national pair driving championship at the team's Festival of Champions yesterday in Gladstone, N.J. The victory made Poulin the leading candidate for the United States team that will compete in the world championship for pairs in Riesenbeck, Germany, in August.</p>
        <p>The selection committee will announce the names of the three team members and an alternate Thursday night. If Poulin, 51, is named, he will be making his fifth appearance in the world championship.</p>
        <p>Poulin drove Ziggy, a 14-year-old Oldenburg gelding, and Camden, a 7-year-old Dutch-bred gelding, to a score of 48.80 penalties in Friday's dressage phase. Poulin used his one allowable roster move and left Camden in the barn and paired Ziggy with Conyer, a 9-year-old Dutch-bred, for Saturday's marathon phase. After all six drivers competed the 8.8-mile course, Poulin had the lead with 124.03 penalties.</p>
        <p>A fault-free trip through the 28 obstacles on today's agility course within the allotted 3 minutes 10 seconds earned Poulin the championship. Lisa Singer of Chadds Ford, Pa., placed second driving the Morgan pair Count On Me and Count To with a fault-free trip in the final phase and a score of 127.10. Jamie O'Rourke of Unionville, Pa., took third driving a Dutch-bred pair with 136.44 penalties.</p>
