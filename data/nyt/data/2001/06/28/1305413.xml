        <p>Not long ago, it sometimes seemed as if every executive from traditional media who could was finding a way into cyberspace. Now, it sometimes seems as if every one of those executives who can is finding a way back.</p>
        <p>Add Patricia Fili-Krushel to the list.</p>
        <p>In April 2000, Ms. Fili-Krushel stepped down as president of the ABC television network to become chief executive of the WebMD Corporation's consumer Internet operation. Fourteen months and one Internet crash later, AOL Time Warner announced yesterday that she would become that company's executive vice president for human resources, effective July 30.</p>
        <p>''It was actually a fascinating time to be in the Internet business, and I learned a lot,'' Ms. Fili-Krushel, 47, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''It's very entrepreneurial. For the most part, they move at lightning speed. I spent the last year working on, 'What is the business model and how do we get profitable?' This change was less about moving back than it was about an opportunity at a company that I really wanted to take advantage of.''</p>
        <p>While at WebMD, Ms. Fili-Krushel ran the company's World Wide Web site that provides consumer health information.</p>
        <p>While shares of WebMD have lost much of their value recently, the company is still worth about $2.4 billion, largely on the strength of its other operations, which include electronic communication services among doctors and insurance companies.</p>
        <p>WebMD announced yesterday that Roger Holstein, an executive vice president, would replace Ms. Fili-Krushel.</p>
        <p>Upon joining AOL Time Warner, Ms. Fili-Krushel will report to Richard D. Parsons, the company's co-chief operating officer. Andrew J. Kaslow is now the senior vice president for human relations and reports to Mr. Parsons. After Ms. Fili-Krushel's arrival, Mr. Kaslow will report to her.</p>
