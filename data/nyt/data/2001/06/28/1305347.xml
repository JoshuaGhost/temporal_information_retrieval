        <p>Teachers and principals at eight Brooklyn schools will be awarded a form of merit pay as part of an experimental program in two community school districts. The educators qualified for the awards, paid by corporate sponsorship, because of rising scores on reading and mathematics tests. At Intermediate School 311 in East New York, the rise was so steep that every teacher got a $2,000 bonus and the principal got a $15,000 bonus. The teachers at the other seven schools received bonuses of $1,000, and the principals received bonuses of $5,500.</p>
