        <p>America Online and AT&amp;T said yesterday that they would jointly develop a new wireless mobile service that will integrate AOL desktop features into a wireless handset. The mobile phones will incorporate features like AOL e-mail and instant messaging. Part of America Online's year-old ''AOL Anywhere'' strategy, the deal could give new momentum to transmission of video and graphics over mobile networks. AT&amp;T Wireless has been pushing to develop such a national mobile network based on international wireless standards known as 3G. The companies also said that AT&amp;T Wireless would substantially increase its marketing presence across the online and offline brands of AOL Time Warner. Planned to run this year and next, the marketing campaign will include promotions for AT&amp;T products.</p>
