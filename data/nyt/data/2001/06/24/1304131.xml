        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest Joe Hagan's article on outsider music, and admired its lack of condescension [''Untamed Sounds From Well Beyond the Margins,'' June 10]. I am sure there are performers like these in every city in the world.</p>
        <p>I wrote for several alternative music publications in Washington in the late 1970's and early 80's, and the city was the home of more than one of these people, whom I prefer to think of as ''primitives.'' There was Butch Willis, whose songs had an undefinable otherworldly quality despite being about the mundane concerns of pop music. And David Johns, the Dootz, whose records still raise the hair. And White Boy, a teenager from Maryland who slammed tunes from an electric guitar while his father sang agonized rants wearing a fright wig. Golly, they were fun.</p>
