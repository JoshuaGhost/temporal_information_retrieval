        <p>THE sketchy and the trashy do fine; so does a neat little entertainment. But when it comes to turning a major work of literature into theater, audiences can be in for a long, bumpy ride.</p>
        <p>What is a ''major'' work of literature? One whose shape and language feel inevitable. On stage our bond with the language gets fragmented. The narrative voice disperses; we're dependent on dialogue, monologue and soliloquy. It's true that in more and more theater pieces actors take on the narrator's role and speak directly to us. They embody the storyteller, but they complicate the function of storytelling. There is a performer in front of us, and we are busy reacting to the performance along with the story. Which may or may not be the best thing for either one.</p>

        <p>What is a ''major'' work of literature? One whose shape and language feel inevitable. On stage our bond with the language gets fragmented. The narrative voice disperses; we're dependent on dialogue, monologue and soliloquy. It's true that in more and more theater pieces actors take on the narrator's role and speak directly to us. They embody the storyteller, but they complicate the function of storytelling. There is a performer in front of us, and we are busy reacting to the performance along with the story. Which may or may not be the best thing for either one.</p>
        <p>How do the director and the set and lighting designers find the best visual language for a writer's descriptions and webs of metaphor? When and how, if at all, should music be used to partner, inflect or replace words? It is endlessly fascinating, this question of how musical sounds and rhythms enhance or entomb a text.</p>
        <p>And finally, how do sights, sounds and people in a public space -- actors and audience -- equal or better the privacy of reading? When you are alone and wholly enthralled, reading takes you to that charged space George Eliot called the roar on the other side of silence.</p>
        <p>None of this means that I wish to protect certain kinds of literature from theater. It is thrilling to see fiction or (much less often) a scholarly text or essay leave the page to seek an independent, equally good and possibly better life on the stage.</p>
        <p>That is what I wanted for Kafka's exquisitely murderous story ''In the Penal Colony,'' made into a music-theater work by Philip Glass and directed by JoAnne Akalaitis. (It is playing at the Classic Stage Company.) We are in an unnamed country, in the shadow of a dead commander. An important visitor from Europe arrives with tepidly civilized values. These are tested when an impassioned colonel from the old regime shows off his prize instrument of torture, lobbying for its continued use despite a new and more lenient commander. A victim and executioner are at hand. The machine is ready to perform its task, which is to inscribe the victim's crime on his flesh with needles. And since the victim has not been told what crime he committed, only at the point of death, when he is literally pierced through, does he understand -- or read -- it.</p>
        <p>The word and the deed are one. The torture is exact, its meanings are multiple. No one is better than Kafka at joining the mysteries of setting and motive to scientific precision about characters and actions, however fantastic the consequences. And for all of those reasons, Kafka cannot be translated literally to the stage. Some theatrical equivalent that invokes without imitating him must be found.</p>
        <p>Literalism is what we are given here. Rudolph Wurlitzer's libretto does some predictable condensing and highlighting. The new element is the figure of Kafka (played by Jesse J. Perez); he recites passages from his diaries, letters and stories, he copies bits of the action, he scribbles text on the floor, which, in John Conklin's well-conceived set design, is covered with writing and with Kafka's picture.</p>
        <p>The music, played by a string quintet, is continuous recitative and declamation over Mr. Glass's familiar ostinato bass. The Visitor and the Officer sang well (I saw John Duykers and Herbert Perry the night I went; on alternate nights, Tony Boutté and Mr. Perry's brother, Eugene, perform the roles). But how ponderous the score sounded: a marriage between the rhetoric of minimalism and the rhetoric of intellectual melodrama.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Akalaitis's direction took the same path. At times she used repetitive gestures and dance patterns to echo or abstract the action. But neither the movements nor the stillness had real physical tension or concentration.</p>
        <p>Everything was solemn, solemn, solemn; anguished, anguished, anguished. You could argue that incessant solemnity and anguish are true to Kafka, but they aren't when deprived of subtlety. Kafka slips wit into his horrors -- details like the Colonel's little vanities over his uniform, or the Visitor's self-consciously inept courtesies toward the Condemned Man. The terrors in his work are all the stronger because they are laid out with cruel delicacy; his shifts between the normal, the abnormal and the grotesque are microtonal. Instead of a music-theater work, we get an intoned and enacted demonstration on the importance of Kafka's story. I felt I was in an induced state of theatrical somnambulism.</p>
        <p>'O Pioneers!'</p>
        <p>Isn't it interesting when a work that isn't out to display weighty intellectual or experimental credentials takes up the same challenge and succeeds? I am thinking of the Acting Company's adaptation of Willa Cather's novel ''O Pioneers!'' which toured the country last year and joined forces with the Women's Project to play at their theater last month. (The production was originally commissioned and developed by the Women's Project more than 10 years ago.) I hope it is revived. A television version of the novel with Jessica Lange had me convinced that Cather should never be dramatized. Not because her work doesn't have drama; there is plenty of ambition and conquest, many kinds of unrequited love and enough lethal marriages for several lifetimes.</p>
        <p>Most of all, in her own words, there is the double life of the family. ''Always, in his mind each member is escaping, running away, trying to break the net which circumstances and his own affections have woven about him. One realizes that human relationships are the tragic necessity of human life; that they can never be wholly satisfactory, that every ego is half the time greedily seeking them, and half the time pulling away from them.''</p>
        <p>This is a wonderful passage, but it shows you why Cather is so hard to put on stage. Her novels are emotional contemplations that also tell stories. Her writing is high minded, and full bodied and self-sufficient. Nobody wrote more sensuously when it came to landscapes, but what good does that do a playwright, composer or director?</p>
        <p>And yet, Darrah Cloud, who wrote the adaptation and the lyrics for ''O Pioneers!'' and Kim D. Sherman, who wrote the music, made it live. As did the cast, under Richard Corley's thoughtful, quiet direction. They gave themselves over to Cather's vision of immigrants year after year struggling with the forces of nature alongside their own demons and longings in late-19th-century Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Cather created a hero -- someone who wins much and sacrifices still more -- in Alexandra, the Swedish farm girl who inherits her father's parched land, grows up and, despite the sloth and greed of her brothers, turns it into a thriving farm. The price? She must turn herself into a solitary stoic driven by the need for security. Alexandra was played with lovely down-to-earth power by Erika Rolfsrud; as in the book, she pulled you to her by the force of her will and belief. The actors grouped and regrouped themselves around the stage like a New World chorus -- Cather knew her Greek tragedies and Roman epics very well. And tragedies unfolded around Alexandra, from the common run of madness, drunkenness and death to the extremities of love, jealousy and murder.</p>
        <p>My greatest fear about ''O Pioneers!'' was that I would see and hear acting and music that insisted on old-time Americana and regionalism: Western musical motifs that were just a bit hokey; Swedish dialect with a fixed lilt that made everyone using it sound precious and look diminutive. I got none of this. The Swedish voices had a lilt that varied and a dignity that came from sounding natural. And in writing the score, Ms. Sherman and Ms. Cloud made an inventive, unexpected choice. They didn't take the usual route of producing lots of songs for individual characters. There were solos, but they were short. The score concentrated on choral singing, exactly what best expressed a community's feelings about the land, all those years of hoping and working, and about aging and death.</p>
        <p>The instrumental music (for piano, violin, cello, clarinet, French horn and accordion) underscored and intensified the story. In that way it was constructed more like a film score than a musical. The writing was old-fashioned in the sense that it had little interest in dissonance, but it did not sound dated. I can't say that it equaled Cather's romanticism and severity, but I can say it served them well.</p>
        <p>'Tick, Tick . . . Boom!'</p>
        <p>Jonathan Larson's posthumous musical ''Tick, Tick . . . Boom!'' gives adapters an entirely different set of problems and anxieties. The show was always meant for the theater. But Mr. Larson turned his main energies to ''Rent'' and died in 1996, hours before that show's first preview. He left several versions of this small, feverish one-man piece, a vision of himself on the verge of turning 30 in 1990, working constantly on his musical ''Superbia,'' desperately wondering if he would ever leave his mark on the form he so loved.</p>
        <p>''Tick, Tick . . . Boom!'' is ''Rent'' in embryo: the middle-class young things shuttling from downtown art and poverty to uptown cash and cynicism. Jonathan (played by Raúl Esparza) wants to make it on Broadway without selling out; he wants his generation to feel some of the excitement and righteous indignation about the world that the 60's generation did. Jonathan's girlfriend, Susan (Amy Spanger), is a dancer who wants to leave New York and have a baby. His best friend, Michael (Jerry Dixon), works in an ad agency and needs to figure out how much longer prosperity will cancel out loneliness.</p>
        <p>It's a young person's vision. We know these struggles. We see them enacted in books and movies; we hear them in the popular songs Mr. Larson so loved. He hadn't yet found a way to place them in a larger landscape, give them a frame and sometimes remove himself from the center. He found both landscape and frame in ''Rent'' through ''La Bohème'' and a whole cast of characters he knew, studied and invented. And there is a hint in ''Tick, Tick . . . Boom!'' of the huge social tragedy -- AIDS -- that will rule his generation.</p>
        <p>David Auburn, the author of the play ''Proof,'' worked to convert this one-man-playing-every-part show into a genuine three-actor piece. Nothing feels fragmented; we are not being given a plate of leftovers. This is a clean, trim work -- self-centered as we all are when we're nearing 30 and desperate to change our lives, but open-hearted too. The score isn't as ambitious or accomplished as that of ''Rent.'' But the deft melodies and the eager fun-loving eclecticism are here: mock patter songs, touches of hard rock, emotional anthems belted out against keyboard, guitar, bass and drums.</p>
        <p>I have great respect for the production at the clublike Jane Street Theater. (I love this space.) Anna Louizos's set is just a backdrop with clocks and city images, two staircases and a few pieces of all-purpose furniture, including something that begins as a synthesizer and turns into a car seat. The band plays on a kind of balcony right above the stage. It is intimate and quick moving and, directed by Scott Schwartz, the performers play with the material instead of hard-selling it.</p>
        <p>There is nothing wrong with a minor piece that is well done. If the story appeals to you, or you are a passionate fan of the artist in question, then a less ambitious work is always worth seeing. If you're not, but you're curious, you're better off with ''Rent.''</p>
