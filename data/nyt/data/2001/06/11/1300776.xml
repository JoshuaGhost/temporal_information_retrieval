        <p>JOE SAKIC took the Stanley Cup from Commissioner Gary Bettman, glanced at the cameras, and then the captain of the Colorado Avalanche spun and handed the huge silver chalice to Ray Bourque.</p>
        <p>''Lifting the Cup, what a feeling,'' Bourque, the 40-year-old defenseman, said later of finally celebrating a Cup championship in his 22nd season in the National Hockey League. ''It's something Joe wanted to talk about after Game 6, but I wouldn't let him. Joe's an unbelievable man.''</p>
        <p>As Bourque hoisted the Cup, Sakic smiled and clapped, enjoying the moment as much as Bourque did.</p>
        <p>''Allowing me to grab it that quick,'' Bourque said, ''tells you what a great leader Joe is.''</p>
        <p>And with Joe Sakic due to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, what an ideal leader he would be for the Rangers on a reorganized roster if they could get him the second time around.</p>
        <p>The first time around four years ago, Neil Smith, then the Rangers' president, signed Sakic to a three-year $21 million offer sheet that the Avalanche had to match within a week.</p>
        <p>''It was a win-win situation,'' Sakic said at the time. ''I was pretty shocked to hear the numbers.''</p>
        <p>When the Avalanche matched the numbers, Smith was shocked. And now Glen Sather, desperate to do something special in his second season as the Rangers' president, surely will pursue Sakic with a carte-blanche contract from the Madison Square Garden treasury.</p>
        <p>The 3-1 defeat in Game 7 on Saturday night in Denver was as sour for the Devils as it was sweet for Bourque, Sakic and goaltender Patrick Roy, the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs for a record third time.</p>
        <p>With a goal and an assist Saturday night, Sakic had 13 goals and 13 assists in the playoffs -- 3 and 6, respectively, against the Devils.</p>
        <p>''What makes him is his speed, his shot, his sneakiness,'' Bobby Holik, the Devils center who was often matched against Sakic, said before Game 6. ''You forget about him, and then he's there. The best thing is to be all over him all the time. He's a combination of that quickness and that quick shot. He's a very, very dangerous player.''</p>
        <p>Sather isn't allowed to covet Sakic publicly until July 1, so he isn't talking. Neither is Sakic.</p>
        <p>But among hockey people there are two not necessarily conflicting theories on Sakic's thinking.</p>
        <p>One, because the Rangers' offer in 1997 forced the Avalanche to pay him many more millions than he had expected, he owes the Rangers another chance. Two, if the Avalanche offer is anywhere close to the highest bid from the Rangers or any other team, he is expected to re-sign with the reigning Cup champions.</p>
        <p>Another factor that could hurt the Rangers' chances is the depths to which they have fallen in not making the playoffs an embarrassing four years in a row. The Rangers need more than Sakic to be a Cup contender. Even with two Cups on his résumé, he may not want to devote himself to skating uphill all the time.</p>
        <p>Then again, Sakic, who will be 32 on July 7, might enjoy the challenge. He should have at least five or six quality seasons remaining, maybe more. His age isn't that much different than was Mark Messier's in 1991 when Mess joined the Rangers at 30 in a trade with Edmonton when Sather was the Oilers' boss.</p>
        <p>In 1994, at the end of his third Ranger season, Messier hoisted the Cup, his sixth after five in Edmonton. Some people wonder if Messier would coexist peacefully in the Ranger room with another obvious leader, which Sakic would be, but Messier coexisted with Wayne Gretzky in winning four Cups in Edmonton.</p>
        <p>Even with Sakic, the Smythe winner when the Avalanche won the Cup in 1996 in a four-game sweep of the Florida Panthers, it would take at least three seasons for the Rangers to assemble enough quality players to be a serious Cup contender. Messier, who will be 41 in January, might be long gone by then.</p>
        <p>Sather is also expected to inquire about two other Avalanche names that will be engraved on the Cup -- Roy and defenseman Rob Blake, each an unrestricted free agent on July 1. With Mike Richter again recuperating from knee surgery, the Rangers need a dependable goaltender, but Roy will be 36 in October; he also might return to Montreal if the Canadiens were to outbid the Avalanche. Blake, who will be 32 in December, has hinted that he might prefer to play in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Of the three, Sakic, Roy and Blake, in that order, would seem to be the priorities for Pierre Lacroix, the Avalanche president. With the N.H.L. not having a salary cap, it's most unlikely the Avalanche can afford to keep all three. And as good as Roy and Blake are, Sakic is the man, their captain and their leader.</p>
        <p>Ray Bourque would testify to that.</p>
