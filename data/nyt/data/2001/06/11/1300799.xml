        <p>Editorial says upcoming execution of Timothy J McVeigh for 1995 bombing of federal office building in Oklahoma City, Okla, will be final moment in personal martyrdom he has been imagining for years, and that it remains to be seen whether he will have afterlife in martyrology of survivalist fringe; argues against death penalty, contending that we should value life more than he valued lives he destroyed (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In late 1994, Timothy McVeigh wrote a letter to the American Legion. ''Does anyone even study history anymore?'' he asked. The word ''study'' was in capital letters, and the sentence closed with three question marks. Mr. McVeigh was 25 years old and only a few months away from entering history himself by blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. Today, he is to be put to death for his crime in a federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind., the first person to be executed by the federal government since 1963. Into a saline drip, a technician will inject, in sequence, drugs to induce unconsciousness, stop breathing and cause cardiac arrest. Twenty-four  witnesses will attest to whatever they can attest to -- the fulfillment of the sentence, the prisoner's manner of dying, the silence of the procedure itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh falsely believed that he had studied American history and that its meaning was embodied in the bomb blast he set off at 9:03 a.m. on April 19, 1995. He had, in his own mind, stepped out of the whirlwind of pamphlets and diatribes -- the world of demented gun-show prophets and paranoid fantasies like ''The Turner Diaries,'' from which he learned his history -- and into the whirlwind of action. As a very young man, something gave Mr. McVeigh the conviction that he understood the irreducible logic of history, when, in fact, all he could see were the crumbs of paranoid propaganda that he swept together for himself. That something -- the key to his reading of America -- was the gun. He always carried one. All other rights, to Mr. McVeigh, were secondary to that right. To him, it defined the behavior of the federal government and the obligations of private citizens. No other relationship, no other ethic mattered.</p>

Twenty-four  witnesses will attest to whatever they can attest to -- the fulfillment of the sentence, the prisoner's manner of dying, the silence of the procedure itself.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh falsely believed that he had studied American history and that its meaning was embodied in the bomb blast he set off at 9:03 a.m. on April 19, 1995. He had, in his own mind, stepped out of the whirlwind of pamphlets and diatribes -- the world of demented gun-show prophets and paranoid fantasies like ''The Turner Diaries,'' from which he learned his history -- and into the whirlwind of action. As a very young man, something gave Mr. McVeigh the conviction that he understood the irreducible logic of history, when, in fact, all he could see were the crumbs of paranoid propaganda that he swept together for himself. That something -- the key to his reading of America -- was the gun. He always carried one. All other rights, to Mr. McVeigh, were secondary to that right. To him, it defined the behavior of the federal government and the obligations of private citizens. No other relationship, no other ethic mattered.</p>
        <p>We have had six years to look into Mr. McVeigh's face. What his eyes show us again and again is the sight of a man who is lost in his own delusional convictions. Many people, especially those who knew him as a boy, have insisted on his politeness, his self-control, on the normal person they knew within him. Nearly everyone who has thought about him has tried, one way or another, to imagine the path that took him from his boyhood in Pendleton, a small town in western New York, to his death in Terre Haute. What is striking about Mr. McVeigh, however, is how short that path really was. He foreclosed on history right out of high school, converting himself into a survivalist, obsessing about guns, working out a way of life that led, in the words of the poet William Carlos Williams, to a ''final and self-inflicted holocaust.'' The Army did not form Mr. McVeigh. The gulf war did not alienate him. He left the military only a little more completely who he was than when he joined it. He was his own invention, formed in the vacuum of a broken family, seduced by an ideal of militant self-control, tutored only in the infallible but utterly fallacious reasoning of outcasts devoted to overturning the government in pursuit of rights they already possessed.</p>
        <p>We are left to wonder what chance event might have turned Mr. McVeigh into one of us, or perhaps into one of the merely embittered men who taught him so much about hatred but never chose to act upon it. Instead, he built a bomb in a truck, parked it in front of a building that to him symbolized the government role at Ruby Ridge and Waco, and then blew it up. It was an act of supreme cowardice, veiled, in Mr. McVeigh's mind, by the sterile language of warfare.</p>
        <p>What makes his act more frightening, even now, is the realization that the Oklahoma City bombing was a work of vengeance by a man who had never been wronged. He had gone to Waco while the siege of the Branch Davidian compound was still going on, and he had done there what ''The Turner Diaries'' encouraged him to do -- imagine himself on the inside, fighting the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. He could imagine that, but he could not imagine settling down, working, marrying, becoming ''domesticated,'' as he put it. The gun he always carried dictated the role he played in his own self-dramatization. He was politically naïve, a cold-blooded murderer, a slow suicide, but a victim of only one thing, the power he felt when he thought about how much harm he could do.</p>
        <p>Despite the administrative fumblings of the F.B.I., Mr. McVeigh's guilt is as certain as certain can be. There are no racial overtones to his conviction, no questions about his mental capacity or the quality of his legal representation. He has expressed no remorse and, since his trial, has only damned himself further in the eyes of the American public with his brutally unfeeling comments about the Oklahoma City bombing. It remains to be seen whether Mr. McVeigh will have an afterlife in the martyrology of the survivalist fringe. But to him, this execution is the final moment in the personal martyrdom he has been imagining for years, the very act he expects from the federal government.</p>
        <p>Some will say that there are at least 168 reasons to execute Timothy McVeigh. His death, foregone though it is by now, will redeem none of those lives. As a society, we must value life more than he valued the lives he destroyed. That is a faith that Timothy McVeigh was unable to reach but which still lies within our power.</p>
