        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* AFRICAN GALLERIES, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (on long-term view). The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country. Just a few years ago, 250 objects from the permanent collection were installed in revamped first-floor galleries; now two dozen pieces have been added and the space has been redesigned again, this time with multicolored walls, mural-size color photographs, documentary films and ambient sound. Added works expand the definition of African to include both Morocco and ancient Nubia. And the overall selection, from familiar friends to treasures recently acquired, is thrilling. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter)</p>

        <p>* AFRICAN GALLERIES, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (on long-term view). The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country.

        <p>* ''AFRICAN, OCEANIC AND ANCIENT AMERICAN ART: RECENT ACQUISITIONS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 28). One of the best new group shows in the city -- stimulating to mind and eye -- is sitting smack in the middle of the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing at the Met, and you've probably never seen the like of much of what's in it. The 70 pieces all came to the Met as gifts or purchases over the last five years. They take many forms, from devotional icons to notebook drawings to Sunday-best hats, and they span centuries and continents, from a tiny Mexican ceramic mask made around the ninth century B.C. to a hummingbird-colored silk mantle woven in Madagascar in 1998. A bottom line to such diversity? Almost everything here was meant to have some contact with the human body: to be worn, carried, caressed. This is art with the velvet ropes down. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''AZTLÁN TODAY: THE CHICANO POSTNATION,'' Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000 (through Sept. 9). Removed in time from the intensely political art of the Chicano civil rights era, almost everything in this show of recent work takes the form of conceptually based photography and video. The tone is low-key; the polish is high. A stance of rooted historical witness has been replaced by ambiguity. Ethnic identity is treated alternately with shrewd comic flair, tender theatricality or autobiographical intimacy. The work is strong; of particular interest is the way it suggests subtle changes in the nature of political art through the 1990's. Hours: Wednesdays noon to 9 p.m.; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and 65+ (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* JACQUES AND NATASHA GELMAN GALLERIES, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5000 (continuing). These glorious new galleries display 50 French modern works, almost all paintings, drawn from the Gelmans' collection. In addition to the paintings here, the collection includes five sculptures, more than 30 drawings and a major work on paper: a Matisse cutout, the Met's first, which will be shown in a subsequent hanging. The standouts installed here include Matisse's Fauve masterpiece ''The Young Sailor II''; a matched set of small, classic Cubist paintings, one by Picasso, one by Braque, both from 1911, arguably the high point of their collaboration; and a fantastically refined, sexually fraught 1929 Dali, ''Accommodations of Desires.'' It is a selection that is not only consistent in its high quality but also, for all the big names and visual firepower, surprisingly personal. It makes the museum a modern art destination in a way that it has never quite been before. Hours and admission: See above (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''EL GRECO: THEMES AND VARIATIONS,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through July 29). This gemlike single-digit exhibition (just seven canvases) outweighs some of the more grandiose shows in New York museums at the moment. It brings together, mostly for the first time, four versions of the artist's tumultuous ''Purification of the Temple,'' which provide a vivid time line of his transcultural development, and three versions of his resonant portrait of St. Jerome as a cardinal, which were all painted toward the end of his life when he skillfully copied -- always with interesting differences -- his works for private patrons. The show makes its small oval gallery reverberate with thoughts about painting: as craft, thought, commodity and lifelong pursuit. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 62+ (Smith).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM KENTRIDGE, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 16). By way of drawings and film animations, Mr. Kentridge addresses in searing images South Africa and its racial problems, along with the longings and frustrations of bourgeois lives played out in the country's deeply dysfunctional setting. The exhibition begins with his jarring ''Shadow Procession'' (1999), a ragtag parade of silhouetted moving images projected on a big screen, which evokes the displaced and dispossessed who haunt not only South Africa but also the history of the world. At the heart of the show are his drawings and the short animated films he makes of them, in which the process shares importance with the content. Many of the films contrast the lives of two antiheroes, one a crude rapacious businessman, the other a sensitive artist, in compelling medleys of images that touch on the personal and the political. Departing from this format is ''Ubu Tells the Truth'' (1997), a highly charged satire based on the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 1995 to investigate human rights abuses during the apartheid era. It's not often that good art is shaped from such raw angry material, but Mr. Kentridge's powers of invention are equal to the challenge. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and 65+ (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Aug. 19). From Michelangelo to Louise Bourgeois, from Rembrandt to Franz Kline, this cornucopia of drawings from one of the most important collections in the United States bristles with the work of stellar talents. A standout is a double-sided drawing in red chalk by Michelangelo, probably done around 1510-1511. One side reveals the trouble he had sketching a foot that fits the position of a youthful male nude on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the other shows the headless nude itself, a powerful, ingeniously posed figure that emphasizes the sculptor's magnificent grasp of anatomical rendering. A rare compositional drawing by Fra Filippo Lippi, a subtly toned landscape by Claude Lorrain, a scene of battling horses by Géricault, a stately portrait by Ingres, one of Seurat's brilliant black crayon drawings of a French vaudeville scene, and works by Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are among the highlights. The 20th-century American group is something of a disappointment, but there is enough great stuff to make this a masterpiece of a show. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 65+ (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''UNIFORM: ORDER AND DISORDER,'' P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Sept. 3). Originally shown in Italy, this exhibition traces the changing forms and symbolism of the modern military uniform as it progresses through and is transformed by the larger culture -- alternately respected and violated, examined and absorbed, abbreviated and exaggerated. The perpetrators include artists like Wolfgang Tillmans, Vanessa Beecroft and Maurizio Cattelan; fashion designers like Prada, Versace and Donna Karan; and scores of terrorists, punks and nameless teenagers. Eight well-stocked vitrines present a plethora of supporting material. The exhibition ends with the real thing: a gantlet of the uniforms and head gear -- from fatigues to parade dress -- worn by members of the different Italian military services. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>LOCKWOOD DE FOREST, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through July 27). By no means a name to reckon with in the pantheon of American view makers, de Forest (1850-1932) specialized in unpretentious small sketches meant to convey the feeling of a place rather than dwell on its physical attributes. His work, until recently kept mostly in family hands, was a visual diary of his many wanderings. In contrast to the taste of the time, he regarded his sketches as finished works, focusing, even in exotic locations like Egypt, India, Syria, Greece and Mexico, on village life, stretches of dunes, desert rocks, tree-lined shores and distant mountains bathed in fog. For those who like their countrysides relaxed and uninvasive, this show will appeal (Glueck).</p>
        <p>LAURA DE SANTILLANA, Barry Friedman, 32 East 67th Street, (212) 794-8950 (through June 29). Blowing glass is a natural for Ms. de Santillana, as her grandfather Paolo Venini founded a glassworks in Murano, Italy, noted for its hospitality to artists. Later it was headed by her and her father. Her abstract sculptures, in tabletop size, have simple, squarish tablet shapes. But they glow with subtle oppositions of brilliant versus muted tones, translucency versus opacity, materiality versus evanescence. Their energy also derives from the tensions they set up between painting and sculpture. Infused with the light values of glass, these painterly sculptures at their best can be dazzling (Glueck).</p>
        <p>JOHN DUFF, Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through June 29). Mr. Duff displays his enduring involvement with industrial materials, geometric form and philosophical conceptions of order. Sculptures from the late 1960's and 70's that are on view here include elegant distorted cylinders or double-ended boat shapes made of rough fiberglass (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>KEITH HARING, Skarstedt, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 79th Street, (212) 737-2060 (through June 30). Promiscuously generous an artist as he was, Haring was also very uneven. This exhibition of just four medium-large canvases from the early 1980's shows him at his best. Two in particular suggest the vision of a modern Bosch. Densely populated by manically interactive demons, monsters and little men, they combine graphic ingenuity, mythic narrative and erotic polymorphism to exhilarating effect (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALEX KATZ, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338 (through July 13). Though famous mainly for his large, elegantly flattened and simplified pictures of beautiful, well-to-do people, Mr. Katz also has a lovely touch on a small scale. This modest but rewarding show of mostly small pictures of women, plus some funky little collages from the 1950's, shows to advantage his delicate brushwork, perfect compositional sense and controlled eroticism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MAX KUEHNE, ''Artist and Craftsman,'' Hollis Taggart, 48 East 73rd Street, (212) 628-4000 (through July 13). A student of Robert Henri, Kuehne (1880-1968) was a competent painter, but his most distinctive contribution was his production of well-made richly decorative furniture, picture frames and wood carvings. Under influences ranging from Japanese to Art Nouveau, he incised outlines of flora and fauna into gessoed surfaces and added colored glazes and burnished metal leaf. The most engaging pieces here are a pair of smoothly carved, elegantly humorous silver giraffes (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through June 30). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop Art by the movement's stars. The 26 objects shown here, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. Among the signature works are Warhol's serial extravaganza, ''200 Soup Cans'' (1962); Mr. Rauschenberg's ''Broadcast'' (1959), a combine painting with a working radio attached; and Mr. Oldenburg's soft ''Drum Set'' (1967), a bodylike sendup of a professional drummer's instruments in vinyl and canvas that droops on a platform in a metaphor for its own spent energy. Collectors' collectors, the Powerses made the pursuit into an art of their own (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* VIJA CELMINS, McKee, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 688-5951 (through June 29). Ms. Celmins just keeps making the same old thing: paintings that are at once rigorously formal and expansively illusory, quietly transcendental and materially sumptuous. This spare, beautifully installed exhibition features eight easel-size paintings: six of starry night skies and two of blurrily luminous spider webs. In the print room, crisp wood engravings of rippling ocean surfaces look like 19th-century illustrations for ''Moby-Dick'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RALSTON CRAWFORD, ''Phantom Forms,'' Laurence Miller Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through June 29). This hard-edge painter often used his camera to record subjects taken up in paintings, but more often his photographs stood on their own. This small show of a dozen or so is a sampling from thousands produced by the artist over the years. His focus in most of the pictures is the play between light and shadow (Glueck)</p>
        <p>CONRAD MARCA-RELLI, ''Canvas Collages,'' Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through June 29). Marca-Relli ran with the Abstract Expressionists in the 1950's, but while his collage-based work always had a bold, rough-hewn immediacy, he was driven more by interest in structure than gesture. His compact, puzzle-like compositions of canvas, paper, mattress ticking and other materials from the 1960's hark back to the glory days of Cubism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ANDREA MODICA/ VICTOR SCHRAGER, Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070 (through June 30). A series of close-up antique-looking photographs of 100-year-old human skulls, exhumed from a mass grave on the grounds of a Colorado mental hospital, is a radical departure for Ms. Modica but lacks the intense humanistic poetry of her justly celebrated ''Treadwell'' series. Mr. Schra ger's quasi-antique photographic still lifes of flowers and old books suggest an Emersonian wedding of nature and culture (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JEFF WEISS, ''The Big Boys Are Coming,'' Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930 (through June 29). Mr. Weiss's large digitally processed, surrealistic photoworks combine appropriated images into crazily disjunctive, apocalyptic landscapes. In one, a woman decapitates a kayaker, while in the distance oil towers belch smoke and fire and a space shuttle takes off. Up close, the pictures have the bland sheen of magazine illustrations; one wonders what these boyish visions might look like if they had been made in some more individualized way (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>PHILIP AKKERMAN, Gorney Bravin &amp; Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through June 30). Mr. Akkerman, a 40-year-old Dutch artist, has painted self-portraits, and only self-portraits, at the rate of one a day, since the mid-1980's. Within this Conceptual framework, he invokes the entire history of portraiture, displays a terrific color sense (especially where skin is concerned), makes good use of his extensive hat collection, and subjects his somber face to an impressive range of physical and formal distortions. (In the project gallery, unusually personal photographic works by Julie Bamber and Catherine Opie are exhibited, their common theme being the artists' fathers.) (Smith).</p>
        <p>RICHMOND BURTON, Cheim &amp; Read, 521 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-7727 (through June 30). Mr. Burton's new paintings speed up his calligraphic strokes and commas to good effect. His palette of silver and gold mixed with red, turquoise or purple also helps to create the impression of decorative and somewhat Middle Eastern imagery -- graceful Persian texts or Byzantine mosaics -- converted pure molecular energy (Smith).</p>
        <p>''CLENCH, CLUTCH, FLINCH,'' Paul Rodgers, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 414-9810 (through June 30). Organized by the critic Dominique Nahas, this 13-artist show makes little sense thematically, but it offers a number of interesting things, including Julianne Swartz's peep-hole view of a bright interior with mirrored balls and fluttering tinsel; Monica Castillo's video of a woman painting on a man's genitalia; Melvin Way's small, diagrammatic, Outsider-like drawings; an inflated man by Tim Hawkinson; a big, wildly elaborate doodle by Diana Cooper; and a set of calligraphic drawings by Henri Michaux (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* STEPHEN DEAN, Henry Urbach Architecture, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-0974 (through June 29). One of the most impressive debuts of the season is that of Mr. Dean, a young French-American artist whose obsession with intense, saturated color has taken him to India, where color is intrinsic to daily life. The result is ''Pulse,'' a painterly, almost unbelievably gorgeous video of the annual spring Holi festival, when residents douse one another with colored powders and water until the streets flow with color (Smith).</p>
        <p>KEN LUM, Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through June 30). Each of this Vancouver-based artist's new works simulates a cheap plastic store sign that includes moveable letters. The temporary letters for Hanoi Travel read: ''Disneyland Packages/ Fun in the Sun/ We remember the People's War.'' This may signify the triumph of global capitalism over local politics, but on the whole this show does not do justice to Mr. Lum's gift for evocatively condensed story-telling (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ANTONIO MURADO, ''Icescapes,'' Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through June 30). The new paintings of this inventive abstractionist walk a fine line between beauty and decorative elegance. Using wide brushes and mostly shades of beige and gray, Mr. Murado streaks and scumbles broad latitudinal swathes, evoking Abstract Expressionist gesturalism and expansive arctic landscapes that hark back to the icy visions of Caspar David Friedrich. Dark yellow, crackled glazes of varnish add a look of old masterish antiquity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHUCK NANNEY, Debs &amp; Company, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 642-2070 (though June 30). ''Everything I do was done by a feminist artist in the 1970's'' is the stance taken by one of the drawings in this show, and it's not far wrong. But Mr. Nanney's crudely stitched together pouches, cardboard pedestals displaying crumpled balls of aluminum foil or bright little pom-poms, have plenty of riffs of their own. Most notable is an overreaching attraction to glamour, attained by the simplest of means. Excess is rarely so economically achieved (Smith).</p>
        <p>* SHIRIN NESHAT, Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through June 29). Three videos isolate themes or devices that Ms. Neshat previously deployed in combination, to more impressive effect. The strongest video is ''Possessed,'' which gains from its Philip Glass score and touches on the artist's main theme -- the plight of women in traditional Muslim societies. The near pitch-dark ''Pulse'' creates an aura of poetic ambiguity for the viewer to unravel, while ''Passages'' has groups of bare-headed men and chador-clad women, in separate groups, in a dramatic setting. United, these qualities succeed; divided, they are far less engaging (Smith).</p>
        <p>ROBERT WATTS, ''Photography Into Sculpture,'' Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450 (through June 30). In the late 1950's and 1960's, Watts (1923-88), a player in the Fluxus movement, worked to undo all the usual ways of conceiving art objects, artists and viewers. This show revisits a time when art could still be innocently revolutionary. ''Three Clouds,'' consisting of three cubes, one all white, one with a photographic surface of human skin and the third photographically dissolved into clouds, is a witty dematerialization of Minimalism and, perhaps, an updated Christian Trinity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>* ''BETWEEN STREET AND MIRROR: THE DRAWINGS OF JAMES ENSOR,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through July 21). The show's pleasure partly involves serendipity. This feels like the perfect moment for an oddball like Ensor, but maybe any time would feel like the right time for somebody whose work, whether it is appalling or fantastic (and it can be both simultaneously), looks eternally modern. The drawings are from the 1880's and 90's. Some started out as ordinary sketches of household objects to which faces and monsters were added, like Rorschachs of the artist's imagination. They somehow become more luminous and translucent the more densely they are drawn, an extraordinary paradox. On the other hand, when the drawings aren't dense, they can be vaporous like Turners, with an effect akin to looking back on a dream: you can't quite place what you are seeing. But the emotion the images provoke is stronger precisely because of the frustration attached to it. Ensor is one of those artists Americans tend to forget or never really knew properly. A hero in Europe, he is vastly deserving of reappraisal here, and this excellent exhibition is a place to start (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>WILLIAM N. COPLEY, Nolan/Eckman Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-6190 (through June 29). A patron of artists and a painter himself, Copley (1919-1996) worked in a witty frou-frou style heavily influenced by decorative patterning à la Vuillard and Matisse. His life, he said, was ''a quest for the ridiculous image,'' and he often found it, giving lighthearted treatment to brothels, prostitutes, priests and policemen. The wacky spirit in this work tickles rather than bites, and like these two indulgences, a little goes a long way (Glueck).</p>
        <p>BRAD KAHLHAMER, ''Almost American,'' Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300 (through June 30). An American Indian reared by white, middle-class parents, Mr. Kahlhamer makes big paintings in which contradictory worlds converge or collide. Painting Abstract Expressionist-style, he generates spacious, Western frontiers and populates them with scrawled Indians in canoes, bison, flying eagles, stacked audio speakers and his own country-western song lyrics. The paintings are raw and baggy, but the spiritual enterprise as a whole is moving (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>* ''CÕTE D'AZUR: ART, MODERNITY AND THE MYTH OF THE FRENCH RIVIERA,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through July 14). ''A dream space created by artists for the 20th century'' is how Kenneth E. Silver, author of the book that spawned this show, describes the French Riviera. And to prove the point, more than 70 works by 40 artists are on view, from Matisse and Picasso to the photographer Jacques-Henri Lartigue and the architect Le Corbusier and including more contemporary talents like Yves Klein and Eric Fischl. Rail access opened up the long-neglected southern coast to commerce and tourism in the 1860's, and the first artists, Renoir and Monet, arrived there in 1883 for a two-week tour. They evidently spread the word, for by the time of World War I the coast had became a mecca for artists whose palettes thrived on the dazzling quality of the light and the clear, fresh colors of the sky, water and vegetation. The Côte d'Azur's heyday is deftly covered, but one caveat: Why clutter this persuasive survey, which really celebrates the coast as a garden of European modernism, with recent and peripheral works by a group of American artists? (Glueck).</p>
        <p>WILLIAM POPE.L / DANIEL J. MARTINEZ, the Project, 427 W. 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610 (through June 30). Solo shows by two outstanding mavericks. Mr. Pope.L's installations of liquor bottles and dolls, recycled Goodwill underwear and prose poems on race are about shifting concepts of inside vs. outside and the insistent invisibility of blackness. Mr. Martinez's self-portrait photographs take a shock-tactic approach to abjection. In one picture, he pulls his viscera out through a slit in his stomach; in another, he leans toward the camera to reveal suture marks circling his head. The pictures are collaborations between Mr. Martinez and the special-effects film makeup artists Bari Dreiband-Burman and Tom Burman (Cotter).</p>
        <p>JENNA SPEVACK, ''Sticks and Stones and Superstrings,'' Here Art, 145 Avenue of the America, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 647-0202 (through June 30). In a written statement, Ms. Spevack makes the dubious claim that her tiny drawings of imaginary stones, sticks and lengths of rope in precariously balanced arrangements illustrate advanced scientific theories. But her finely drawn, whimsical pictures have considerable faux-innocent, comic appeal (Johnson).</p>

        <p>* ''WILLIAM BLAKE,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). A touching and beautiful show if you have a taste for Blake's art, which strives for ecstatic revelation on the level of his famous visions and rises to the heights of his verse, sometimes. From the Age of Aquarius to New Age, he has come to serve as the patron saint of flower children, Jungians, Freudians, occultists, spiritualists, nudists, unpublished authors, animal lovers, socialists and teenagers of the sort who read Hermann Hesse. By turning our attention to his laborious illustrations and watercolors, the exhibition compels us to think about him as a serious and original visual artist, which is to say as a more idiosyncratic and substantial figure than the clichés suggest. He truly believed that the world was ending and that he had been sent to set things right at the last minute. Whatever else he may or may not have been, Blake was the most genuine and uncompromising artist you can think of. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''FREESTYLE,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through Sunday). Spring in New York brings new-talent museum surveys, and this spring, ''Freestyle'' is the one to catch. The museum's curator, Thelma Golden, working with Christine Y. Kim, has brought together 28 young or youngish black artists from across the country, some of whom are appearing here for the first time. The show is, for the most part, punchy to look at (painting dominates), full of ideas and, with the intriguingly complex notion of a ''post-black art'' in the air, completely of this American moment. Not to be missed is the spicy magazine-style catalog with essays by some of the best young art curators and critics around. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and 62+ (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* EDUARDO SARABIA, I-20 Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-1100 (through tomorrow). Animated by walls painted with green vines, this impressive debut roams freely across several mediums, the artist's Mexican roots and the Los Angeles cityscape. The centerpiece is a festival-float cornucopia that has references to sex, violence and the materialistic American dream (Smith).</p>
