        <p>Clashes between Roman Catholic and Protestant residents of Belfast, Northern Ireland, continued for the second consecutive night tonight.</p>
        <p>The police reported smaller crowds than on Wednesday, when more than 600 people rioted in the city's worst night of street violence in three years. But tonight riot control police used armored vehicles to separate warring factions, and a Catholic high school suffered extensive fire damage in what police believed to be an arson attack.</p>
        <p>Today's violence, like Wednesday's, began with a pipe bomb thrown at a Catholic home in a mostly Protestant area of Belfast.</p>
        <p>No one was injured by the bomb, but in the ensuing chaos more than 300 people hurled stones and gasoline bombs at each other and at police.</p>
        <p>Catholic parents were prevented from escorting their children to school by Protestant gangs throwing stones. Protestant community leaders accused Catholic republican groups of orchestrating the situation as a publicity stunt.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, took an optimistic view of the situation.</p>
        <p>''By any standards at all, the situation, notwithstanding the current difficulties, is much better than it has been last year or the year before or the year before that,'' he said after addressing members of Congress.</p>
        <p>But the fragile Northern Ireland peace process faces difficulties in the coming weeks as the leader of the mainly Protestant Unionist party, David Trimble, must make good on his threat to resign as first minister of the fledgling home-rule government if the I.R.A. does not make good on its pledge to decommission its weapons.</p>
