        <p>Vernon Downs, the embattled harness track in upstate New York, has been granted an extension of a temporary license until the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The New York State Racing and Wagering Board decided yesterday to extend the license because the track had corrected many shortcomings that the board had pointed out in a 19-page report, said Stacy Walker, a spokeswoman for the agency.</p>
        <p>''At this point, they are in substantial compliance with all racing laws and rules,'' she said. ''The board felt they should be given an opportunity to run a track.''</p>
        <p>Jim Moran, a track spokesman, said that ''we're delighted that we received not only the permanent license, but also the vote of confidence that went with it.''</p>
        <p>Vernon Downs, one of five active harness tracks in the state, is on 600 acres east of Syracuse. It was founded in 1953 and quickly became one of the country's most popular harness tracks. But its fortunes began to decline in the mid-1970's as tracks closer to New York City offered larger purses to racers, and bettors turned to other forms of gambling.</p>
        <p>The latest blow came in the state board's April report. It found the track and its former president, John J. Signorelli, responsible for poor management and mishandling of finances. The board put off the license renewal application, which was submitted last December, and granted a 90-day temporary license. That license was due to expire on Tuesday if the track did not resolve most or all of the 16 problems noted in the report.</p>
        <p>Walker said ''the one remaining concern is their long-term financial stability.''</p>
        <p>The track has been looking recently at several multimillion-dollar proposals for a buyout. Walker said she heard that the Oneida Indian Nation, which runs the nearby Turning Stone Casino, had been in talks to take over ownership. Moran confirmed that talks had been taking place.</p>
        <p>Mark Emery, a spokesman for the Oneida Nation, said he had not heard of such discussions, although ''the Nation looks at all types of property in this area.''</p>
