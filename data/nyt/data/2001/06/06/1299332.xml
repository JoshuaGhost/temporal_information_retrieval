        <p>Michael Bloomberg began broadcasting a 60-second commercial in English on six New York area television stations yesterday. A 30-second spot in Spanish is being broadcast on Univision.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Squier Knapp Dunn in consultation with David Garth.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Single, continuous close-up shots of Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate for mayor, standing on a street corner in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, for the English-language piece and in East Harlem for the Spanish-language spot.</p>
        <p>THE ENGLISH AD SCRIPT -- There's no place like New York. I love this city. But we know this town's a tough place to govern. A strong mayor at City Hall made a big difference. Today, crime is down. New York City is doing better. My name is Mike Bloomberg and I'm running for mayor to build on what's been accomplished, not to tear it down. I've spent my whole adult life in New York City, raising a family, creating jobs, helping others. Managing. Teaching. Leading. My experience has taught me how to get things done: bring people together; solve problems; be honest, shoot straight; hold myself accountable for results. When you make a promise, you keep a promise. Going back to politics as usual in New York City is crazy. Together, we'll keep making progress on crime. And if we bring the same energy and same focus that made our streets safer and use it to improve public schools and public health care, this great city will be even better. Thank you.</p>
        <p>THE SPANISH AD SCRIPT -- Hello, I'm Mike Bloomberg. I want to be your mayor. I want to work for all of New York. And for that reason, I'm learning Spanish. I apologize if I don't speak it very well, but I'm going to improve. If you see me in your neighborhood, talk to me. I want to know what you think. Remember, my name is Mike Bloomberg. Thank you.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Bloomberg spent his youth in Medford, Mass., but has lived in Manhattan since 1966, after getting an M.B.A. from Harvard. He is the divorced father of two children, Emma, 22, and Georgina, 18. The financial information company he founded 19 years ago, Bloomberg L.P., employs 7,200 people worldwide, 2,500 in New York City.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Both advertisements are extremely plain on the surface, but they obviously serve different missions. In the English version, he quickly lays out what will be his central campaign theme: if elected, he will largely stick to the agenda set by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, perhaps focusing more on health care and schools. He does not directly refer to his financial news empire, but his straight talk -- with an occasional return to his native Boston accent -- is that of a businessman, as he is clearly trying to distinguish himself from the other mayoral candidates who are all career politicians.</p>
        <p>In the Spanish-language ad, Mr. Bloomberg tries to seem relaxed, as he smiles and is tieless. He slowly but clearly reads a script. He makes no allusions to Mayor Giuliani or the drop in crime, instead focusing on introducing himself to a part of the city population less likely to know anything about him. Voters still know little about where he stands on many of the issues. But he has five months and millions of dollars to spend explaining that.</p>
