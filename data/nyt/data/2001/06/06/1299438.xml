        <p>William W. Scranton III, a former lieutenant governor, said he would not seek the Republican nomination for governor next year because of family and business considerations. Many party leaders had been pressing him to enter the race, on the theory that his name recognition and money would make him a stronger candidate than the other Republican hopefuls, Attorney General D. Michael Fisher and Treasurer Barbara Hafer. Mr. Scranton's father was governor from 1963 to 1967. Democrats are expected to nominate either Auditor General Robert P. Casey Jr., also the son of a governor, or former Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia.</p>
