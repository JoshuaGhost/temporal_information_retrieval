        <p>Re ''Milosevic Is Given to U.N. for Trial in War-Crime Case'' (front page, June 29):</p>
        <p>There was never any doubt that one day, Slobodan Milosevic would land in court, where the charges against him would be adjudicated. The question was what court. Now that that's been decided, it raises at least two serious questions.</p>
        <p>First, the legitimacy of the Hague court, which was created specifically to try people for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. A number of international scholars have questioned that court's legitimacy.</p>
        <p>Second, the contradiction in the United States' stance toward such a court. It has insisted that the Yugoslavs deliver Mr. Milosevic while itself remaining adamant against any authority of an international criminal court over United States citizens.</p>

        <p>The writer is professor emeritus of political science at Vanderbilt University.</p>
