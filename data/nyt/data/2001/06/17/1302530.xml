        <p>The court session on Tuesday in Lower Manhattan is expected to be so routine that Stanley K. Patz has no plans to attend. But in a tormented life, like the one Mr. Patz has endured for the last 22 years, things that hurt too much sometimes find hiding places in the routine.</p>
        <p>His lawyer will ask a judge to declare Mr. Patz's missing son, Etan, legally dead, so that Mr. Patz can pursue a wrongful-death lawsuit against a convicted pedophile in Pennsylvania who he believes killed the boy.</p>
        <p>Etan Patz was last seen on May 25, 1979, as he left his SoHo home to catch the bus for school. It was the first time he had been allowed to walk the two blocks alone. He was 6.</p>
        <p>Etan's death, even if determined only by the stroke of a judge's pen more than two decades later, would mark a wrenching turning point in an ordeal that has forever changed the way Americans look at boys and girls gone missing.</p>
        <p>Officially, his disappearance remains an open case with the police and the Manhattan district attorney.</p>
        <p>''I know the pain of losing a child, but I only had to go 65 days,'' said Marc Klaas, an advocate for missing children whose 12-year-old daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and murdered in California in 1993. ''This is probably the most excruciating personal decision the Patz family has ever had to make. It is making an admission they have fought against for so many years.''</p>
        <p>Etan's disappearance came before the era of missing children's faces appearing on milk cartons and made-for-TV movies exploring a seeming epidemic of vanishing children. The search for the little blond boy spanned continents, and the uncertainty about his whereabouts wilted New York City like a suffocating summer heat wave. To honor the boy, President Ronald Reagan declared May 25 as National Missing Children's Day.</p>
        <p>''He became a symbol of a movement that was developed to help other children like him,'' said Nancy A. McBride, the director of prevention education at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which was founded in 1984. ''Everybody can still picture Mrs. Patz letting this child for the first time go to school by himself, thinking this is a milestone day.''</p>
        <p>Yet throughout it all, somehow Etan had been kept alive. He just had to be. There was no room for doubting it. ''How else can we bear it?'' Mr. Patz once explained in an interview. ''What else are we going to do? This is no movie where you can cut to another scene.''</p>
        <p>So Etan was said to be in Israel or in Massachusetts or in the grip of an underground network of child molesters. As the years passed, photos of the boy posted by the police were ''age-progressed'' to show Etan growing into a teenager. The Patz family never moved from their Prince Street loft, and they kept the same phone number, the one Etan had learned by heart, in case he tried to come home.</p>
        <p>But on Tuesday, Mr. Patz's lawyer, Brian O'Dwyer, will argue in Surrogate's Court that Etan is not coming home.</p>
        <p>If the judge, Surrogate Eve Preminger, is persuaded, the boy will be declared dead and Mr. Patz will be appointed the administrator of his son's estate.</p>
        <p>''This is a preliminary step,'' Mr. Patz said on Thursday. ''There is still a long way to go.''</p>
        <p>Seeking a declaration of death is an unusual move in the case of any missing child, the authorities say, but in this instance it is even more remarkable because Mr. Patz is not looking to collect life insurance, considered the most common reason.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Patz wants to pursue in civil court what the police and the prosecutors have not pursued in criminal court: a judgment against the convicted pedophile, Jose A. Ramos, 56, who the authorities say is the main suspect in the boy's disappearance but who has not been charged in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramos is in prison in Pennsylvania for sexually molesting an 8-year-old boy. He had been an acquaintance of a woman who worked for the Patzes as a baby sitter and in May 1979, he lived in a tenement on the Lower East Side, about a mile from the family. He once admitted to investigators that he was with Etan on the day the boy vanished, but he denied abducting him or killing him. A search by the police last year of the building where Mr. Ramos lived turned up nothing.</p>
        <p>''In truth, we know what happened,'' Mr. O'Dwyer said. ''This declaration of death becomes a way for us to proceed in the absence of a criminal case, which the district attorney has decided is not viable at the moment.''</p>
        <p>Because the burden of proof in civil matters is lesser than in criminal ones, Mr. O'Dwyer is hopeful that a case against Mr. Ramos can be built upon evidence that the authorities have considered too weak or circumstantial to charge him with a crime. The evidence includes statements by prison informers that Mr. Ramos told a cellmate that he had taken Etan to his apartment and sexually assaulted him. ''Etan is dead, there is no body, and there will never be a body,'' the cellmate is supposed to have quoted Mr. Ramos as saying.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, a successful wrongful death lawsuit might influence parole authorities in Pennsylvania not to release Mr. Ramos before his sentence of up to 20 years is completed.</p>
        <p>''It makes people aware that the individual incarcerated in Pennsylvania is responsible,'' said Stuart R. GraBois, a former federal prosecutor who had aggressively pursued leads involving Mr. Ramos and who now advises the Patzes on the case.</p>
        <p>In 1998, it was Mr. GraBois who first publicly raised the likelihood that Etan was dead and that Mr. Ramos was responsible. Mr. GraBois did so, he said, because of concerns that Mr. Ramos might be granted parole when he became eligible in September 2000. The parole was denied.</p>
        <p>Mr. GraBois said last week that he knew Etan was dead the first time he interviewed Mr. Ramos more than a decade ago. ''After the interview, I was convinced, as were the detectives who were with me,'' he said. ''And I believe the F.B.I. was convinced as well.''</p>
        <p>But the unusual move to pursue Mr. Ramos in civil court without a criminal case against him brings with it substantial risks, according to Ms. McBride, who works at the national center's office in Florida and who has counseled hundreds of distraught relatives of missing children since the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Not only must the Patzes cope emotionally with the official recognition of their son's death, Ms. McBride said, but they must somehow prepare themselves for the possibility that they will get nothing out of it.</p>
        <p>''It is a real gamble to go forward this way,'' she said. ''There are no winners here. Even if they are successful, it doesn't change what happened to Etan. And if they are not successful, they have gone through the trauma and emotion for what? What is their next recourse? This is it. There is no place else to go from here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Patz said he was not focusing much on Tuesday's court proceedings because for him, the pivotal moment -- and real heartbreak -- came last November. It was then that Mr. O'Dwyer filed the papers that will lead to the session before Surrogate Preminger. Signing his name to those documents, Mr. Patz said in November, was like signing his son's death certificate.</p>
        <p>''I made it psychologically, and I made it physically,'' Mr. Patz said last week of his change of heart about Etan's fate and his need to pursue the man he considers the killer. ''That's done. What is happening now is zero. It is nothing to me. What else can I tell you?''</p>
        <p>In reality, though, it has probably been emotionally tougher than that in the Patz home. Mr. Patz's change of heart is still working its way through the courts seven months later in part because his wife, Julie, has been unable to change hers.</p>
        <p>Mr. GraBois said the law requires that both parents sign the documents requesting that Etan be declared dead, but Mrs. Patz did not. A waiting period ensued, during which objections could be raised.</p>
        <p>''She finds it difficult, so she is not involved,'' Mr. O'Dwyer said. ''But she is not opposing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. GraBois added, ''She would just like to have this behind her.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klaas, the father of the murdered California girl, said most decisions surrounding missing children are so personal that it is not surprising when family members do not see eye to eye.</p>
        <p>''In these situations hope begins as a boulevard and ends as a very narrow thread, and at some point the thread breaks,'' Mr. Klaas said. ''Maybe Mrs. Patz has a little more hope than he does. Maybe she isn't willing to give up what she has. Maybe his little thread has broke and hers hasn't.''</p>
