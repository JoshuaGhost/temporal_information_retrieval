        <p>The Food and Drug Administration warned companies putting herbal additives in food yesterday that their products could be illegal because the ''novel ingredients'' might not be generally recognized as safe.</p>
        <p>Saying that the herbs have never been approved for consumption in food, the agency has sent warning letters to three companies whose products contain ginkgo biloba, Siberian ginseng and echinacea, popular ingredients that have increasingly made their way into dozens of food items and drinks.</p>
        <p>Letters to more manufacturers will follow over the next week, the agency added, as part of a newly invigorated effort to protect what it calls ''the integrity of the conventional food supply.''</p>
        <p>For months, F.D.A. officials have watched with concern as food companies have peppered their products with ingredients that were once found only in herbal medicines sold in health food stores. Yet this is the first time that the agency has directly challenged the practice of adding relatively common herbs like echinacea and ginkgo to food that now appears on grocery store shelves across the nation.</p>
        <p>The three companies to receive the first round of warning letters -- Hansen Beverage Company, U.S. Mills and Fresh Samantha, which is owned by Odwalla -- are all relatively small compared with some of the giant manufacturers that also put the herbs in foods and drinks.</p>
        <p>But while the initial enforcement effort had a limited reach, F.D.A. officials said they hoped it would put all manufacturers on notice that the agency may ask them to come forward with scientific evidence to prove that their ingredients are safe.</p>
        <p>''There are hundreds of these products and hundreds of companies,'' said Dr. Christine Lewis, director of the F.D.A.'s office of nutritional products, labeling and dietary supplements. ''There's no reason to think that any of them are any different.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, PepsiCo's panoply of SoBe beverages and the Cadbury Schweppes line of Snapple drinks both have products with echinacea in them, just as ginkgo biloba and Siberian ginseng can be found in any number of drinks sold by several major manufacturers. When asked whether the agency's scrutiny would extend beyond the handful of companies initially chosen and fall on many others as well, Dr. Lewis replied, ''They should take note.''</p>
        <p>Defending his products, Hansen's chairman, Rodney C. Sacks, said the company had no immediate plans to remove echinacea from its drinks, and would strive to prove the herb's safety.</p>
        <p>''There are millions of bottles from dozens and dozens of manufacturers on the shelves around the country with echinacea,'' Mr. Sacks said. ''We've never had a complaint from anyone.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Fresh Samantha said officials there had not yet received the letter, while U.S. Mills officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Under the law, food producers are only allowed to add ingredients that the F.D.A. has approved ahead of time, or those that are generally recognized as safe by scientists. Otherwise, the agency can deem the products adulterated and move to order them off the market.</p>
        <p>While there is little evidence to show that the herbs in question are dangerous in food, there is scant proof that they are safe. In fact, though few significant adverse reactions have been associated with ginseng or echinacea, many researchers think that ginkgo may exacerbate bleeding or even cause hemorrhaging when taken in conjunction with certain medications, particularly anti-coagulants.</p>
        <p>If the F.D.A. expands its scrutiny to include all food and drinks with these herbs, many companies will suffer a significant economic blow. Herb-infused drinks are the fastest-growing segment of the beverage business, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan, a market research firm.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the market for herb-laden food and beverages totaled no more than $20 million in annual sales. After big manufacturers like Pepsi and Cadbury became involved, bringing the rainbow-colored drinks to convenience stores nationwide, the figure jumped to $700 million last year, offering one of the best engines for growth in an industry otherwise struggling for more revenue.</p>
