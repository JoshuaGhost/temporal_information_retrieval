        <p>N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern still strongly believes that putting an age limit on players entering the draft will help the league prosper, but he has resigned himself to putting the issue aside.</p>
        <p>''The players association has indicated that it's not a subject that it's prepared to agree to,'' Stern said today during his annual address at the N.B.A. finals. ''Since we're not prepared to unilaterally implement it, it's on the back burner for now.''</p>
        <p>As the number of high school players entering the draft has proliferated annually, Stern has campaigned loudly for an imposed age limit, casually mentioning age 20 as a benchmark. But today, he relented, in spite of his misgivings.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's constructive for us,'' Stern said. ''I don't feel enhanced by having 70 N.B.A. team personnel at the McDonald's high school All-American game. I don't think it's good for us. I don't hold teams accountable for sending someone there. But I don't think in balance at this point, in our development and the development of our sport that our current rule would be as good as something which strongly discouraged players or kept them from coming out of high school.''</p>
        <p>Stern also addressed the tenuous positions of two franchises. After the citizens of Charlotte voted down a referendum measure for a new arena, the general perception was that the franchise might consider moving in two years. But Stern discounted that notion, adding that the citizens of Houston also voted down a referendum measure for a new arena before eventually voting in favor of the facility.</p>
        <p>Stern also indicated that the Grizzlies were on the brink of moving to Memphis, saying that a vote on a new arena next week would most likely lead to the league's board of governors approving the move.</p>
