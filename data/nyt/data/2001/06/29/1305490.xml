        <p>Editorial says Microsoft's partial victory in appeals court ruling does not minimize underlying triumph for federal prosecutors and American consumers; says core of decision affirms Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that company illegally maintained monopoly in market for computer operating systems; says Justice Dept must continue insisting on as stringent a remedy as possible; holds that principles of case remain highly relevant with Microsoft gearing up to release Windows XP</p>

        <p>Both sides claimed victory after yesterday's unanimous ruling by seven judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Microsoft antitrust case. The software giant and its investors were clearly relieved that the judges had vacated the lower court's order breaking up the company and reversed one of the findings of illegal behavior on Microsoft's part.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft's partial victory should not be allowed to minimize the underlying triumph for federal prosecutors and American consumers. The core of yesterday's decision affirmed United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly in the market for computer operating systems.  This is an important victory for antitrust enforcement and a sufficient basis for the government to continue pressing for a meaningful remedy in the case. With Microsoft preparing to release Windows XP, a new version of its operating system, this fall, the Bush administration should act vigorously to uphold this ruling and be vigilant against future anticompetitive behavior by the company.</p>

        <p>Both sides claimed victory after yesterday's unanimous ruling by seven judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the Microsoft antitrust case. The software giant and its investors were clearly relieved that the judges had vacated the lower court's order breaking up the company and reversed one of the findings of illegal behavior on Microsoft's part.</p>
        <p>But Microsoft's partial victory should not be allowed to minimize the underlying triumph for federal prosecutors and American consumers. The core of yesterday's decision affirmed United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly in the market for computer operating systems.  This is an important victory for antitrust enforcement and a sufficient basis for the government to continue pressing for a meaningful remedy in the case. With Microsoft preparing to release Windows XP, a new version of its operating system, this fall, the Bush administration should act vigorously to uphold this ruling and be vigilant against future anticompetitive behavior by the company.</p>
        <p>Referees rarely lose contests, but Judge Jackson emerged as one clear loser from the appellate court's ruling. The court found that his behavior in denigrating Microsoft and its chairman, Bill Gates, to news organizations including The New York Times in secret, embargoed interviews had ''seriously tarnished the proceedings'' and violated judicial canons. As a result the judges took the drastic step of removing him from the case. It will now be remanded to a different trial judge to hear evidence on one of the government's three antitrust claims, involving the inherent illegality of tying the Internet Explorer browser to Windows, and then to arrive at an appropriate remedy for that claim and for the illegal practices that the appeals court has already agreed were used to maintain Microsoft's operating systems monopoly. Judge Jackson was also faulted by the appellate court for not holding an evidentiary hearing in which Microsoft could address the government's proposal to split up the company.</p>
        <p>Judge Jackson's substantive rulings were not thrown out but rather reviewed on their merits, because the appellate court found that his denigrating comments had occurred in the remedial stage, and never rose to actual bias or prejudice at trial.  Hence, in a well-reasoned opinion, the court upheld Judge Jackson's key finding that Microsoft used licensing agreements with Internet service providers, computer manufacturers and other software companies to illegally freeze out the Netscape Internet browser. It did so to protect its Windows monopoly, as it feared that Internet browsers could eventually replace operating systems as the computer's hub. However, the court reversed his finding that the government had proved that much of the same behavior constituted an illegal attempt to also monopolize the market for Internet browsers.</p>
        <p>Though the appellate court suggested that it may be difficult for a trial court to find that a breakup of Microsoft is the most appropriate remedy, the Justice Department must continue insisting on as stringent a remedy as possible. The fact that this court of appeals, historically sympathetic to Microsoft's claims, has unanimously ruled that the company has systematically violated the Sherman Antitrust Act should give pause to anyone within the Bush administration who may be tempted on ideological grounds to reach a lenient settlement. This case can no longer be dismissed in Republican corporate circles as a product of some overzealousness on the part of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Moreover, though the Internet browser wars may seem a thing of the past, the principles of this case remain highly relevant with Microsoft gearing up to release Windows XP. There are troubling signs that the company will once again try to tie a host of new products to its operating system, and it has reportedly held talks with America Online and others to provide them preferential access to Windows XP in exchange for their favoring Microsoft applications over competitors. These negotiations echo some of those chronicled in Judge Jackson's trial. The Justice Department, in other words, needs to stay on the case.</p>
