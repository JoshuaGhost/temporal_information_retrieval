        <p>Meetings today and Wednesday in Paris bringing together technical experts and officials from the five major powers on the Security Council are expected to give the first clear indication whether a revised oil-sales plan for Iraq stands a chance of being approved soon, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
        <p>The two days of talks are focusing entirely on a list of goods that the United States has proposed to hold up for scrutiny before a sale can go through under the new ''oil for food'' plan. The British and Americans hope the plan will be approved by the council before July 3, when a temporary extension of the old plan runs out.</p>

        <p>Meetings today and Wednesday in Paris bringing together technical experts and officials from the five major powers on the Security Council are expected to give the first clear indication whether a revised oil-sales plan for Iraq stands a chance of being approved soon, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
        <p>The two days of talks are focusing entirely on a list of goods that the United States has proposed to hold up for scrutiny before a sale can go through under the new ''oil for food'' plan. The British and Americans hope the plan will be approved by the council before July 3, when a temporary extension of the old plan runs out.</p>
        <p>The new program would remove bans on almost all civilian exports to Iraq, while tightening controls over arms imports and trying to stop the smuggling of Iraqi oil outside United Nations control, through neighboring countries.</p>
        <p>Money from oil sales would continue to go to a United Nations-supervised escrow account. That provision, and other integral parts of sanctions resolutions going back to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, could not be lifted until after Iraq allowed arms inspectors to return to the country.</p>
        <p>Negotiations on the new British-sponsored resolution have picked up momentum since the end of May, when the Council was far from agreement and clear divisions were forming among Russia and the United States and Britain.</p>
        <p>A meeting in Budapest two weeks ago of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his Russian and Western European counterparts injected a spirit of compromise into negotiations, diplomats said. They are waiting to see if talks between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Slovenia on Saturday will further improve the working atmosphere here.</p>
        <p>The American list, and the prospect of President Saddam Hussein and neighboring countries like Jordan, Syria and Turkey losing a profitable trade in smuggled Iraqi oil appear to be the two most difficult issues under discussion.</p>
        <p>The Iraqis fiercely oppose an end to the illegal trade in oil, which the United States and other countries had chosen to ignore in order to keep the neighboring nations from suffering unduly from the unintended consequences of sanctions.</p>
        <p>Iraq has threatened to cut off all oil to the neighbors if the illegal trade ends, and they would have to be compensated in some way for the loss.</p>
        <p>Turkey, which says it has lost $30 billion in trade with Iraq under sanctions, began talks on the new oil-sales proposal in Baghdad on Monday with Iraqi officials.</p>
        <p>The five leading Council members -- Britain, France, China, Russia and the United States -- are still not in agreement on how much oil Iraq will be allowed to sell legally to neighboring nations along the current illegal routes, what compensation would be in order if Iraq cut off oil to punish those nations or where the money would come from.</p>
        <p>On the American list of potentially prohibited goods, the French, the Russians and some independent experts say that it is too long and includes items like computers and computer operating systems that are readily available on the private market almost everywhere, but could be denied to all Iraqis, just on the suspicion that they could have military uses.</p>
        <p>Some new elements have entered the negotiations on the proposed Council resolution. The French are proposing that in addition to goods, certain services -- excluding financial services -- be allowed in Iraq under the new rules. That would mean that consultants, trainers and maintenance experts might be included in sales agreements. It would not preclude, for example, investment in providing health care with attendant expertise. The Netherlands, not now a Council member, has suggested that the Council consider allowing foreign investment in Iraq, including the oil industry.</p>
