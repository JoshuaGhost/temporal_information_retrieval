        <p>AFTER scrutinizing domestic hotel revenue and occupancy data for the first three months of this year, Robert Mandelbaum confidently predicted last month that while the industry looked a little wobbly as business travel sagged, growth would most likely continue.</p>
        <p>''What we've learned from analyzing the first- quarter 2001 data is that, for the most part, travel does not stop,'' Mr. Mandelbaum, the director of research for the Hospitality Research Group of PKF Consulting, wrote in firm's quarterly newsletter on hotel trends.</p>
        <p>He had an update for that assessment yesterday. It looks now as if travel does stop, or at least pause. Starting in April and continuing into the spring, the decline in business travel has unexpectedly accelerated to the point where some industry analysts are saying the hotel business is experiencing its worst period in 10 years.</p>
        <p>''What a difference a month makes,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. For the hotel industry, he added, ''the outlook has unfortunately gotten worse'' than most experts were expecting even as recently as last month.</p>
        <p>Early this year, with corporate travel departments reacting to predictions of impending sags in quarterly profits, airlines and hotels alike felt the impact as business travel slowed.</p>
        <p>''Up to April, it was the convention business that tailed off,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. ''But then starting in April and May, we're seeing with the preliminary numbers that it's the regular business traveler'' whose numbers are falling off sharply. At the same time, industry analysts say they are seeing a pronounced shift away from high-priced hotels to medium and economy brands among those who do still travel.</p>
        <p>The declines in April hotel data, compared with April 2000, were sharpest in major business centers. ''In Chicago, business travel was down 21 percent and convention demand down 12 percent,'' Mr. Mandelbaum said. ''In Denver, business travel was off 17 percent.'' In Atlanta, the convention business was off 37 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>For the domestic hotel industry, the revenue per available room declined in April for the first time since 1991, analysts say. Of course, bad news for hotel owners and operators can mean good news for business and leisure travelers, who can expect to see hotel bargains and discount promotions across the board this summer.</p>
        <p>''It's really exciting, unless you're in the hotel business,'' said Bjorn Hanson, the hotel consultant for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''Looking at the last two months, April and May, we'd have to go back to the gulf war in 1991'' to see comparable weak performances, he said.</p>
        <p>Usually, declines in hotel business happen when leisure travel drops. Not so this time. ''This is being led by business travel,'' Mr. Hanson said.</p>
        <p>In April, corporate travel managers evidently arrived at a kind of consensus that further cutbacks were needed. ''Businesses, almost in step in April, put the brakes on all kinds of travel,'' including the kinds of individual trips that had not yet been curtailed in earlier cutbacks this year, Mr. Hanson said.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing that businesses reacted so uniformly -- it was as if the big hand hit 12 and everyone in business said the same thing at the same moment,'' he continued.</p>
        <p>As individual trips are cut back, the convention and meeting business, which is the mainstay of many urban hotels, continues to stagger. According to preliminary data, the number of conventions and meetings canceled during the first half of the year will have doubled from the same period last year, Mr. Hanson said. And overall attendance at the events being held is down, too. ''Instead of sending five people, two are being sent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bobby Bowers, the vice president of Smith Travel Research, said that the 2.5 percent decline in per-room revenue that his firm estimated for April over the month a year earlier was the sharpest drop in that number since June 1991.</p>
        <p>''And the preliminary figures suggest that May is probably going to be worse than April was,'' Mr. Bowers said. ''There's no hard evidence we've seen that things have even started to flatten out yet.''</p>
        <p>However, leisure travel, Mr. Bowers added, seems to be ''holding up pretty well,'' although other analysts said that some leisure travelers had delayed booking some trips this summer because they might be awaiting expected discounts and promotions from desperate hotels.</p>
        <p>One major recent shift in the current cutbacks has been a curtailment in use of luxury hotels as travel departments enforce more rigid travel policies. ''There's been a tremendous movement from the high-end hotels, the Ritz-Carltons and Four Seasons, into the Hiltons and Marriotts,'' said Thom Nulty, the president of Navigant International, the big travel management company.</p>
        <p>Next week, we will look at that trend -- and at how long-lasting it might be. Meanwhile, reader comment is hereby solicited: How have the cutbacks affected your choices of hotels on the road?</p>
