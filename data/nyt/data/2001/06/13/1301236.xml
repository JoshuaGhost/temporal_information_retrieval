        <p>The Senate defeated an amendment today that would have permitted low-income parents in 10 cities to use taxpayer dollars to send their children to private and religious schools.</p>
        <p>The vote -- 58 to 41 -- effectively buried one of the cornerstones of President Bush's education platform, despite a hard push by conservatives who viewed this year's education debate as their best chance to sell the idea. Three Democrats voted for the proposal and 11 Republicans voted against it. The tuition aid, often referred to as vouchers, was also rejected by the House three weeks ago on the day it passed Mr. Bush's education bill.</p>
        <p>In a passionate debate, the two sides squared off over an issue that has long pitted Republicans against Democrats. Republicans contend that publicly financed vouchers are an innovative way to give children in dead-end schools a better education and to force public schools to improve. Democrats who say the approach offers only false hope to children argue that vouchers are a threat to public schools, which will see some money steered to private schools.</p>
        <p>''It sounds so good,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, ''but it has a number of serious flaws that doom it. Experiments have demonstrated absolutely no evidence that vouchers help improve student achievement.</p>
        <p>''Secondly, we know that vouchers do not help the students who need the help the most. They do nothing to help improve public schools. Vouchers only further segregate and stratify our public schools.''</p>
        <p>But conservatives, who have battled for years to pass vouchers, said Democrats were callously condemning poor children to horrible schools, denying them the same kind of escape hatch afforded to wealthier students who can pay private and parochial school tuition.</p>
        <p>One of the amendment's chief sponsors, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said, ''These are real people who are locked in inner-city schools who didn't have the option for a better education like folks with more money, who are seeing their children left behind.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregg called Democratic opposition to the idea ''totally elitist,'' and said it was ''outrageous that we stand here on the floor of the Senate and don't give parents an option so they can compete for the American dream.''</p>
        <p>The Senate continued to plod through the president's education bill and could finish its work later this week. The legislation would alter the federal government's role in education by requiring annual testing to gauge a school's progress, helping the most troubled schools improve and ultimately holding schools accountable for their failure.</p>
        <p>Over the past two months, Democrats and moderate Republicans have reshaped the bill by passing amendments that call for more spending for children with disabilities, low-income students and for an assortment of programs. The Senate has also watered down a testing provision by making it more difficult to trace the progress of children by race, income and ethnicity. Conservatives, who say the education budget is scheduled to be increased by 11 percent next year, are unhappy with the call for more spending.</p>
        <p>Democrats are pressing Mr. Bush to dedicate more money to education, arguing that schools cannot improve without the resources. Today, the new majority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, held out the possibility that Democrats might delay passage of a final House-Senate education bill, one of Mr. Bush's signature campaign issues, if the president does not commit to spending more money.</p>
        <p>''We still have to find the resources,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''I told the president last week that it was not our desire to complete this work until we have some understanding about the degree of resources that will be available for all of the issues that we're confronting here in the bill itself. Reform is impossible without resources.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has already compromised on several key issues, including vouchers. Warned by Democrats that vouchers would kill the legislation, the president backed away from the measure before sending his education blueprint to Congress in late January.</p>
        <p>But the issue is critical to conservatives, who view what they call ''school choice'' as an alternative to the status quo and a way to improve public schools by forcing them to compete with private ones.</p>
        <p>The measure voted on today would have allowed 10 school districts in three states to funnel federal dollars to low-income students in failing public schools if they chose to participate. That money -- a total of $50 million for next year -- could be used to help pay for private school tuition. The children would be selected through a lottery and discrimination would be prohibited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregg called it a modest proposal and wondered aloud why Democrats were so fearful of it.</p>
        <p>''What is it they fear?'' he asked, offering a long list of answers. ''They fear that it may threaten those unions who for years have told us mediocrity works. They fear that this may actually disrupt the public school system.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the education committee, said the proposal would guarantee no child a good education since private schools could reject applicants. He said vouchers, which have been tried in several cities, had not been shown to improve performance.</p>
        <p>The Senate also rejected an amendment by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, that would have forced states to give the same level of service to all school districts, rich and poor alike.</p>
