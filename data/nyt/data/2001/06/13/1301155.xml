        <p>THE exponential growth of the auction company eBay remains, even in the wake of the Nasdaq crash, one of the more notable success stories of the new economy. Less well known, however, are the many companies that have profited by supplying eBay's customers with everything from imaging services to insurance to appraisals.</p>
        <p>In some cases, these companies, having been bought or acquired by eBay, serve the auction house's clientele exclusively. Others, like SquareTrade, an online dispute resolution service based in San Francisco, serve multiple partners. Still, as Steve Abernethy, the president and chief executive of SquareTrade, said, ''EBay was our first and only customer when we launched.''</p>
        <p>Thanks to that affiliation, he said, particularly eBay's decision to make SquareTrade its exclusive dispute resolution service, ''we've expanded to a much broader base of partners.'' As he explained, ''Other markets emulate eBay, they look to them as the biggest marketplace. So if eBay adopts something, other markets and businesses will adopt those practices and tools as well.''</p>
        <p>Munjal Shah, the president and chief executive of Andale, an auction-services company in Mountain View, Calif., agreed. ''Our original beachhead was auctions on eBay,'' he said. But he hopes the company can expand to other markets.</p>
        <p>Here's a sampling of the different types of companies that have emerged to service the buyers and sellers on eBay -- and beyond:</p>
        <p>PICTURE SERVICES: No one wants to bid on something sight unseen, but posting pictures can be cumbersome. That is why  several companies have sprung up to offer what is called dynamic imaging. The oldest company is Pongo, which has been marketing image hosting to eBay users since 1996 for 50 cents a picture. More recently, Ipix  has entered a strategic alliance with eBay, offering sellers the option to ''drag and drop'' images from their desktop to their listing for a small fee.</p>
        <p>COUNTERS: Other companies offer eBay merchants additional tools like counters,  which keep sellers apprised of how many bidders have viewed their items. The most ubiquitous is an ''honesty'' counter distributed by Andale. ''We offer the counter for free to get people to try our other services,'' said Mr. Shah of Andale. Another popular counter is sold by Andale's competitor, AuctionWatch.</p>
        <p>APPRAISALS: A number of appraisal companies market their services to buyers on eBay, many of whom are not certain how much they should bid for, say, an antique ottoman. Eppraisals.com has emerged as the premier provider, thanks to its status as eBay's principal online appraisal service. The company, which taps more than 1,000 experts in antiques, fine arts, coins, stamps and other collectibles, gives online estimates of items up for auction for $20 each.</p>
        <p>SNIPING: Not all the companies that feed off eBay's transactions have formal partnerships with the company. So-called ''sniping software,'' available from WinningBid Pro! (www.umklaydet.com) and iSnipeit.com and others, helps buyers by automatically submitting the winning bid within seconds of the auction's completion. ISnipeit says that its software ''allows you to rest easy knowing that your competitors will have literally no time to react to your bid.'' While eBay is neutral on the subject of sniping, its use by auction sophisticates has stirred debate in eBay chat rooms.</p>
        <p>ELECTRONIC CHECKING: Since eBay's inception, several companies have marketed a variety of electronic payment services. For several years, PayPal has been the most popular service, charging a small fee to sellers in exchange for vetting and processing the buyer's payment by credit card or by check. More recently, eBay has instituted its own electronic-payment service by acquiring Billpoint, thus joining forces with Wells Fargo, which also bought a stake in Billpoint. The new service, prominently featured throughout the eBay site, offers many of the same services as PayPal, but with the eBay imprimatur.</p>
        <p>ESCROW: Other companies market escrow services, promising to keep buyers and sellers honest. Ebay's preferred provider is Tradenable, which for a small fee holds the buyer's payment until the seller meets certain conditions, like shipping the item in one piece. If you are shipping something big -- a car, for example -- Escrow.com markets itself on the home page of eBay Motors.</p>
        <p>SHIPPING: Assuming that everything works out and the check clears, the seller inevitably looks for an appropriate shipper. Several companies meet that need. The most prominent is United Parcel Service, which eBay has integrated into its site, enabling buyers and sellers to calculate rates in advance. Other shippers include Simply Postage, which enables users to print their own postage; IShip, which provides shipping estimates; Mailboxes Etc.(www.mbe .com); and E-Stamp.com.</p>
        <p>MEDIATION: A final subindustry has marketed itself to eBay users who find themselves enraged when, say, the dish they ordered arrives with a crack down the middle and the seller refuses to refund the money. SquareTrade, an online dispute resolution service, has emerged as eBay's primary provider of such services. Customers can use an automated service that allows each party to establish how far it is willing to go to settle the problem. If that does not work, the disgruntled party can request a professional mediator for $15, drawing on the company's network of 250 professional mediators worldwide.</p>
