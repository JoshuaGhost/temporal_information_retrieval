        <p>For the last few years, Champagne Veuve Clicquot has been struggling with an e-mail hoax. A message has circulated worldwide, tricking many people into believing that if they forwarded the message to 10 friends and sent a copy to the company, they could win free bottles of Champagne. It also led some Internet users to wonder if the company, a subsidiary of LMVH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in Paris -- was pulling a stunt to gather their e-mail addresses.</p>
        <p>For a while, the company thought it might be able to vaccinate itself against the viral hoax by posting warnings on its Web site (www.clicquot.com). It also sent messages to anyone who forwarded the e-mail message, assuring them that their e-mail addresses were not being collected.</p>

        <p>For the last few years, Champagne Veuve Clicquot has been struggling with an e-mail hoax. A message has circulated worldwide, tricking many people into believing that if they forwarded the message to 10 friends and sent a copy to the company, they could win free bottles of Champagne. It also led some Internet users to wonder if the company, a subsidiary of LMVH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in Paris -- was pulling a stunt to gather their e-mail addresses.</p>
        <p>For a while, the company thought it might be able to vaccinate itself against the viral hoax by posting warnings on its Web site (www.clicquot.com). It also sent messages to anyone who forwarded the e-mail message, assuring them that their e-mail addresses were not being collected.</p>
        <p>But after the bogus message gained new momentum when it made the rounds among investment banks a few months ago, Veuve Clicquot decided that it needed some damage control.</p>
        <p>Last week, the company started an e-mail campaign of its own, with real prizes like free Champagne and, for one winner, a trip to France.</p>
        <p>''We're really trying to counteract this crazy hoax,'' said Louise McGuane, the company's communications and marketing manager in New York. ''We're trying to get rid of it once and for all.''</p>
        <p>Although she acknowledged that the promotion probably could not end the hoax, which could survive indefinitely through forwarded messages, she said the company's new campaign was an ''antihoax'' that would remind customers of the integrity of the company, whose Champagne house has been in operation since the 18th century.</p>
        <p>To begin the promotion, the company plans to send messages to people who have already joined its online club, which entitles customers to receive Clicquot e-mail messages about special events. The messages, Ms. McGuane said, will direct people to a Web site where they can play a game to win various prizes.</p>
        <p>The Web site will also invite people to forward the e-mail message to friends who may want to play. But Ms. McGuane bristled when asked if this was actually a more subtle attempt to build a database of addresses.</p>
        <p>''This is not a way to capture data at all,'' she said. ''It will work the same way our club works. If you want to hear from us in the future, you opt in.''</p>
