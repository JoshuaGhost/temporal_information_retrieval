        <p>Music critics and fans alike have squandered hours debating what distinguishes a jazz from a cabaret singer. The conventional wisdom holds that one swings and the other doesn't, that one improvises and the other doesn't, that one performs in cellars, the other in supper clubs. But in a case by case comparison, those distinctions begin to blur.</p>
        <p>Take Blossom Dearie, the ageless singer and pianist who owned the JVC Jazz Festival concert called Cabaret Jazz Hall of Fame at the Kaye Playhouse on Thursday evening. Ms. Dearie swings delicately, buzzing around a song with the lightness of a hummingbird. Her exquisitely shaded pianism deepens songs with rich blues and jazz embellishments. At the  same time, Ms. Dearie maintains a traditional sense of pop decorum, respecting her material and conveying lyrics with minutely calibrated shadings of humor and pathos.</p>

        <p>Music critics and fans alike have squandered hours debating what distinguishes a jazz from a cabaret singer. The conventional wisdom holds that one swings and the other doesn't, that one improvises and the other doesn't, that one performs in cellars, the other in supper clubs. But in a case by case comparison, those distinctions begin to blur.</p>
        <p>Take Blossom Dearie, the ageless singer and pianist who owned the JVC Jazz Festival concert called Cabaret Jazz Hall of Fame at the Kaye Playhouse on Thursday evening. Ms. Dearie swings delicately, buzzing around a song with the lightness of a hummingbird. Her exquisitely shaded pianism deepens songs with rich blues and jazz embellishments. At the  same time, Ms. Dearie maintains a traditional sense of pop decorum, respecting her material and conveying lyrics with minutely calibrated shadings of humor and pathos.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dearie was by far the most compelling of the four performers to appear on a program that offered various combinations of pop polish and jazzy animation. Her set opened with her signature song, the modern jazz standard ''I'm Hip,'' and focused on material from her recent album, ''Blossom's Planet'' (Daffodil).</p>
        <p>The singer and pianist Freddy Cole, who opened the evening, maintains a similar sense of decorum, singing in a mellow, husky-edged baritone that suggests a slightly gruffer echo of his brother Nat. In general, Mr. Cole keeps a swinging but low-key profile, avoiding the darker side of pop expression and projecting an easygoing bonhomie. The jazziest his set became was during a tightly coordinated piano duet with his guitarist, Jerry Byrd.</p>
        <p>The least jazzy of the four, the singer and pianist Ronny Whyte, wore a white dinner jacket reminding one of a chaperon at a 1950's high school prom. His ballad-heavy set was about as close to jazz as Steve Lawrence might get juicing up a song by snapping his fingers.</p>
        <p>The 85-year-old pianist Joe Bushkin, the program's final performer, was introduced by a compilation of film and television clips tracing his career back to his days with Tommy Dorsey's band. The clips revealed a fiery pianistic playfulness that was all but absent from his short set.</p>
