        <p>Tom Farmer wants to earn his College World Series championship ring this time.</p>
        <p>Farmer, a senior right-hander and the nephew of the former major league reliever Ed Farmer, was on the Miami team that won the national title in 1999, but did not pitch in the series.</p>
        <p>This time Farmer (14-2), who went from being the team's No. 3 starter at the beginning of the season to its ace, will start today's championship game against Stanford in Omaha.</p>
        <p>The Hurricanes (52-12) have used a blend of speed, timely hitting and solid pitching to win 16 straight games and set up their showdown against the Cardinal (51-16).</p>
        <p>The left-hander Mike Gosling (7-2), Stanford's starter, said Miami's running game was a concern. ''You have to try to get the first guy out in the inning, and that eliminates some of the stuff they can do,'' he said.</p>
