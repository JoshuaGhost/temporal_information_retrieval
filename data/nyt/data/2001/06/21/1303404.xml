        <p>A correction officer in Manhattan who was stabbed in the eye last fall while guarding terrorism suspects in a federal jail told colleagues after the attack that he ''gave them a fight,'' said an officer who recalled his words yesterday.</p>
        <p>The account of the attack on the guard, who was critically injured, came on the second day of a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan in which prosecutors are seeking to persuade a jury to impose the death penalty on a terrorist who bombed the American Embassy in Tanzania in 1998, killing 11 people.</p>
        <p>The bomber, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, was never charged in the  stabbing of the guard, Louis Pepe, but prosecutors told the jury this week that Mr. Mohamed assisted his cellmate, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, in the attack, which they said was an attempt to take hostages and possibly free other terrorism suspects. The attack occurred on Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>In eliciting the testimony about Officer Pepe's reference to giving  ''them a fight,'' the prosecution appeared to be trying to show that both Mr. Salim and Mr. Mohamed were involved in the attack.</p>
        <p>Officer Pepe suffered severe brain damage when a sharpened comb was plunged into his eye, and he is apparently unable to testify.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors are citing the stabbing in arguing that if Mr. Mohamed is sentenced to life in prison, he will pose a serious threat to guards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mohamed's lawyers are vigorously contesting the government's contention that he was involved in the stabbing, or that he should be executed for the embassy attack.</p>
        <p>They have blamed their client's cellmate, Mr. Salim, for the stabbing. Mr. Salim is awaiting trial in the attack, as well as in a terrorism conspiracy case.</p>
        <p>In their cross-examination yesterday, the defense lawyers also elicited  testimony from government witnesses that appeared to bolster their contention that the assault on Officer Pepe occurred because security was lax on 10 South, the maximum-security wing of the Metropolitan Correctional Center.</p>
        <p>For example, there was testimony that Officer Pepe was the lone officer guarding terrorism suspects on 10 South. There was also direct testimony that after an alarm went off, it took about 15 minutes for rescuers to get the keys and reach him.</p>
        <p>The defense has also contended that guards retaliated against Mr. Salim and Mr. Mohamed once they were subdued after the attack.</p>
        <p>One government witness, Paul J. McAllister, a former lawyer for Mr. Salim who met with his client in the minutes before the attack, testified that he saw guards dragging an apparently unconscious Mr. Salim down the hallway in a trail of blood, and that one guard then took a key and plunged it into Mr. Salim's eye, causing blood to spurt out.</p>
        <p>The jury never heard about the attack on Officer Pepe during the bombings trial, but prosecutors are using the incident as one of the ''aggravating factors'' in favor of execution. The defense will offer mitigating factors against the death penalty.</p>
        <p>One witness, Lt. Glenn Carrino, acknowledged that Officer Pepe said after his rescue that the prisoners ''slipped the cuffs and I fought back.'' That seemed to contradict earlier testimony that Mr. Pepe was seen escorting Mr. Salim without handcuffs before the attack.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Carrino conceded on cross-examination that no tape was made of the assault because a video recorder had been broken for about five months. ''As far as why it was not fixed, I cannot tell you; I don't know,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As officers reached the cell shared by Mr. Salim and Mr. Mohamed, another guard, Lance Maiden, said they found Mr. Mohamed outside his cell with his fists clenched ''in a fighting stance.'' Mr. Maiden said that Mr. Mohamed lunged at them, and struck him in the mouth.</p>
        <p>Another officer testified that he used a piece of plexiglass as a shield to pin Mr. Mohamed to the wall.</p>
        <p>The guards then saw Officer Pepe shut in the cell with Mr. Salim.</p>
        <p>''He was covered in blood,'' Lieutenant Maiden said. ''He had this object protruding from his eye and his shirt was all torn. His tie was off.''</p>
        <p>Officer Pepe's condition has not yet been fully detailed to the jury, but one guard said she visited him three weeks ago and he did not recognize her.</p>
