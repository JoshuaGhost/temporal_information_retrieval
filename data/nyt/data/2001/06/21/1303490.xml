        <p>A consumer watchdog group said yesterday that a survey of bank branches throughout New York State found that virtually all heeded or nearly heeded state guidelines as to the deposit, balance and other requirements of the low-cost checking accounts they offered. But the group, the New York Public Interest Research Group, contended that more than half of the 62 branches of 30 banks it surveyed did too little to promote such accounts, which a 1994 state law required banks to make available. Michael P. Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association, said he had not seen the survey, but added that ''our association supported the law in '94 and supports it today.''</p>
