      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on Herman Badillo's formal entry as Republican candidate for New York City mayor; holds Badillo's breadth of experience stands in stark contrast to that of Michael Bloomberg, Badillo's opponent in Republican primary</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With the formal entry yesterday of Herman Badillo as a Republican candidate for mayor, the lineup for replacing Rudolph Giuliani looks complete. Four major Democrats and two Republicans now compete in earnest for their parties' slots. Mr. Badillo, who first ran for mayor in 1969, bears all the virtues and scars from such longevity in New York politics. This breadth of experience, however, provides a stark contrast to Michael Bloomberg, a first-time candidate who looms as Mr. Badillo's rich and formidable opponent in the city's first real Republican mayoral primary in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>Both Republican candidates are former Democrats, but Mr. Badillo has long been a voice in Mayor Giuliani's chorus, especially on education issues. Despite such loyalty, the mayor and Gov. George Pataki have taken their public praise elsewhere, offering more encouragement to Mr. Bloomberg than to Mr. Badillo. At one point the governor's aides were trying to edge Mr. Badillo out of this primary contest in order to give the Bloomberg candidacy time to mature without any early competition. Mr. Badillo weathered the pressure, so voters in both major parties will now have a choice in the September primary.</p>

        <p>With the formal entry yesterday of Herman Badillo as a Republican candidate for mayor, the lineup for replacing Rudolph Giuliani looks complete. Four major Democrats and two Republicans now compete in earnest for their parties' slots. Mr. Badillo, who first ran for mayor in 1969, bears all the virtues and scars from such longevity in New York politics. This breadth of experience, however, provides a stark contrast to Michael Bloomberg, a first-time candidate who looms as Mr. Badillo's rich and formidable opponent in the city's first real Republican mayoral primary in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>Both Republican candidates are former Democrats, but Mr. Badillo has long been a voice in Mayor Giuliani's chorus, especially on education issues. Despite such loyalty, the mayor and Gov. George Pataki have taken their public praise elsewhere, offering more encouragement to Mr. Bloomberg than to Mr. Badillo. At one point the governor's aides were trying to edge Mr. Badillo out of this primary contest in order to give the Bloomberg candidacy time to mature without any early competition. Mr. Badillo weathered the pressure, so voters in both major parties will now have a choice in the September primary.</p>
        <p>While some see this as the autumnal campaign of a perennial candidate, Mr. Badillo's rhetoric still has its bite. With his announcement, he immediately began taunting Mr. Bloomberg, demanding debates with the newly minted candidate and making much of the fact that Bloomberg commercials in English praised Mayor Giuliani while those in Spanish did not. The presumption is that many Hispanic voters are more wary of Mr. Giuliani than non-Hispanics are. Such barbs could force Mr. Bloomberg onto the defensive, but they could also provide an important preliminary round for a first-time candidate in advance of the general election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Badillo's personal story has long warmed the hearts of his followers. He is an orphan who came from Puerto Rico and became a congressman, Bronx borough president and adviser to New York City mayors. When he talks about the reform of the city's education system -- from prekindergarten to City University of New York -- it is a world he knows well, both as a student and most recently as chairman of CUNY's board of trustees. Mr. Badillo also gets civic credit for agreeing to participate in and abide by the rules of the city's progressive campaign finance system. Mr. Bloomberg is shunning the city's system in order to use more of his own money, a decision that allows Mr. Badillo to qualify for extra public funds.</p>
        <p>In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans almost 5 to 1, winning a mayoral election is an uphill fight for any Republican. As for the primary, the Bloomberg and Badillo campaigns will be battling over about 500,000 registered Republican voters. Now those voters have two recent converts to their party -- one a novice running with plenty of money, the other a veteran running against the wishes of the G.O.P. hierarchy.</p>
