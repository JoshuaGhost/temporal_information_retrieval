        <p>RICHARD P. MATSCH, the federal district judge who presided over the Oklahoma City bombing trial, denied Timothy J. McVeigh's request to delay his execution, set for tomorrow morning.

        <p>Meanwhile, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a sharpshooter from the F.B.I.'s Hostage Rescue Team could be tried on manslaughter charges for the shooting death of Vicki Weaver, the wife of a white separatist killed during a standoff in 1992 with agents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho -- a galvanizing event for anti-government militants, of which Mr. McVeigh is an extreme example.</p>

        <p>RICHARD P. MATSCH, the federal district judge who presided over the Oklahoma City bombing trial, denied Timothy J. McVeigh's request to delay his execution, set for tomorrow morning. But he also said he was shocked by the F.B.I.'s belated discovery of thousands of pages of documents in the case that the government had not turned over to defense lawyers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a sharpshooter from the F.B.I.'s Hostage Rescue Team could be tried on manslaughter charges for the shooting death of Vicki Weaver, the wife of a white separatist killed during a standoff in 1992 with agents in Ruby Ridge, Idaho -- a galvanizing event for anti-government militants, of which Mr. McVeigh is an extreme example.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials have said the numbers of such extremists have dwindled in recent years. In their place, the F.B.I.'s most fervent critics now seem to be mainstream proponents of the rule of law. They, too, complain that the bureau is too powerful and out of control, and they add more examples: the troubled case of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos nuclear scientist, and the embarrassing arrest of Robert P. Hanssen, a senior F.B.I. agent, as a spy for Moscow.</p>
        <p>Leaders in Congress from both parties have criticized the agency's performance and have demanded a searching examination. The Congressional reviews come at an awkward time, since F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh is stepping down this month a, and the Bush Administration is searching for a new leader.</p>
