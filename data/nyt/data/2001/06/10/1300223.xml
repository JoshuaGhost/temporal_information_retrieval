        <p>Barbara L Kornblau letter on Adam Shatz May 13 review of Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical by Anthony Bourdain (S)</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Adam Shatz's review of ''Typhoid Mary'' (May 13) touches on some of the shortcomings of Anthony Bourdain's version of the story. Despite the book's subtitle -- An Urban Historical'' -- one can hardly call this a work of history.</p>
        <p>Bourdain completely ignores the historical context within which Mary Mallon lived, and which Judith Walzer Leavitt, in her book ''Typhoid Mary,'' so eloquently brought to life. In 1906, the germ theory was not accepted by most physicians, let alone a working-class immigrant woman. To her death, Mallon refused to believe that some tiny creatures living in her body could make those around her deathly ill while not causing her so much as a sniffle. Mary's culinary specialty was peach cobbler laced with millions of typhoid bacilli.</p>
