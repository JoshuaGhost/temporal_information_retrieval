        <p>Even before the April collision between a Chinese fighter and a Navy reconnaissance plane, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was taking a skeptical look at contacts between the Pentagon and the Chinese military. Afterward, however, Mr. Rumsfeld all but severed the contacts. Chinese generals are no longer invited to seminars at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, a Pentagon-funded research center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld's policy has few fans among current and retired U.S. military officers in the Pacific region. They argue that the U.S. has much to gain from engaging the Chinese military. The ties, they say, can build trust and can provide the United States with insights into the secretive Chinese armed forces. Mr. Rumsfeld has now promised to restore the ties after the Navy plane is returned but has offered no specifics.</p>
