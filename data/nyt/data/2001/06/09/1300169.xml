        <p>Jeff Gordon continued his march back to the top of Nascar yesterday and Shawna Robinson officially started her drive into the history books.</p>
        <p>Gordon, on a resurgence after a disappointing 2000 season, turned a lap of 188.250 miles an hour around Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn to win the pole for tomorrow's Kmart 400.</p>
        <p>It was his third pole this season and 36th of his career -- three of which have come on this 2-mile oval. That ties him with Alan Kulwicki for the track record.</p>
        <p>But Gordon was overshadowed by Robinson, who qualified 32nd. When she takes the green flag tomorrow, Robinson will be the first woman to start a Winston Cup race since 1989.</p>
        <p>''This means everything to me,'' she said as her crew from MK Racing embraced her.''Nobody wants it more than I do. This isn't about making one race, this is about the future and racing full-time next year.''</p>
        <p>Patty Moise was the last woman to compete on Nascar's top circuit, racing in five events from 1987 to 1989.</p>
        <p>Gordon, who put his Chevrolet on the front row for the seventh time this season, said he was excited for Robinson.</p>
        <p>''I've always said it doesn't matter if you're a male, a female or what color your skin is -- if you have the talent to be out there, you deserve to be out there,'' Gordon said.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who will attempt to make four more Winston Cup races this season before trying a full schedule in 2002, tried hard to shift the focus away from her gender. But Robinson, a 36-year-old mother of two, could not help but stand apart from the 42 men in the field.</p>
        <p>''I'm a racer who just happens to be a girl,'' she said. ''I grew up around race tracks and my dad raised me to be competitive.''</p>
        <p>While Gordon locked up the pole as soon as he ran his qualifying lap, Robinson had to sweat it out after turning a lap at 185.529 m.p.h. More than an hour went by while she patiently watched the scoring monitor to see how many cars were slower than her Ford.</p>
        <p>When it became clear she would make the field, her crew jumped up in joy and her husband, an engine builder for Dale Earnhardt Jr., ran over to hug her.</p>
        <p>It was the second time this season Robinson had attempted to make the field. Her first try, at California Speedway in April, ended when she broke a gear on her qualifying lap.</p>
        <p>Ricky Rudd, the last man to attempt to qualify, came within two one-thousandths of a second of knocking Gordon off the pole. Rudd ran a lap at 188.240 to earn his Ford the second starting spot.</p>
        <p>Mike Skinner will start third in a Chevrolet. Earnhardt Jr. will start seventh.</p>
