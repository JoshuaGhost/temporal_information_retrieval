        <p>GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company, said it would cut 1,455 jobs, mainly in Britain and Ireland, and sell a factory employing 720 more in Scotland as it seeks to save money. Martin Sutton, a company spokesman in London, said the cuts represented the most substantive element of a cost-saving review that began after the $68 billion merger last December of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. Facing the same pressures as other drug giants to lower manufacturing costs and share research budgets, GlaxoSmithKline said it was looking to cut $2.2 billion in costs by 2003. Mr. Sutton said further job cuts were likely among the company's 100,000-member work force, affecting plants outside Europe and the United States.</p>
