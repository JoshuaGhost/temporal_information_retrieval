        <p>Not cherry, not fire engine, not flame -- the signifying color for urban streets this summer is flag red. Worn jauntily in the form of pedal pushers, baggies, slit skirts and the now-obligatory bra top, it is always in tandem with something crisply white. The combination could be called yachty, patriotic, Sara Murphy in Juan-les-Pins, or else an unwitting nod to the superhip boutique hotel, the Townhouse in Miami, decorated by the supercool India Mahdavi.</p>

        <p>Not cherry, not fire engine, not flame -- the signifying color for urban streets this summer is flag red. Worn jauntily in the form of pedal pushers, baggies, slit skirts and the now-obligatory bra top, it is always in tandem with something crisply white. The combination could be called yachty, patriotic, Sara Murphy in Juan-les-Pins, or else an unwitting nod to the superhip boutique hotel, the Townhouse in Miami, decorated by the supercool India Mahdavi.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the reference point, red and white was without doubt the dominant sartorial statement of the 44th Puerto Rican Day Parade, traditionally a key indicator of seasonal urban cool. It is a fact too little appreciated that street fashion is both influenced and represented at its finest during this annual wingding, which -- despite last year's attacks on 50 women -- has more typically functioned as the city's most colossal runway show.</p>
        <p>Cabana sets made their first contemporary appearance at the parade sometime in the 90's. So, in later years, did overalls worn off the shoulder, rhinestone body jewelry, California gang-style neck tattoos in Gothic script and the particular form of long-tailed do-rag that leaves its wearer resembling a foreign legionnaire.</p>
        <p>As always, there were courts of miniature infantas on hand -- crinolined, crowned, sceptered and reigning from atop one of scores of commercially sponsored floats. But there were also rafts of people dressed in imitation bumpkin style in collapsible straw hats and clam diggers; and larger-than-ever groups of ostentatiously muscled young men; and thousands of people serving as living billboards for brands as various as Knorr soup (hand fans), Pepsi (caps) and the Telemundo television network (T-shirts).  And, of course, there's the inevitable beefy fellow accessorizing with a giant reptile. Note to fashion-minded herpetologists: Burmese pythons are always in style.</p>
