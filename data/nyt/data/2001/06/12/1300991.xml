        <p>Critics of New Jersey Acting Gov Donald T DiFrancesco's plan to build arena in Newark, NJ, say plan is deeply flawed because it does not include redevelopment plan for Meadowlands (M)</p>

        <p>When Gov. Christie Whitman, on her last day in office, unveiled a plan for a new sports arena for Newark, her successor, Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, complained that the plan was doomed because it did not include a redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands, where the Continental Arena will go dark if the New Jersey Nets and Devils depart for Newark.</p>
        <p>Now, four months later, Mr. DiFrancesco has come up with his own plan. Critics, including many in his own party, are complaining that it is deeply flawed because it does not include a redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford.</p>
        <p>Officials working on the project say Mr. DiFrancesco went public with his proposal last Wednesday because of pressure from the YankeeNets, the consortium that owns the Nets and the Devils, to come up with a firm arena plan before the legislative session ends this month. And they say Mr. DiFrancesco is trying to put together a proposal to turn the Meadowlands into a retail and entertainment destination accessible for the first time by commuter rail service.</p>
        <p>The question now is what sort of assurances are needed between now and July 1 to persuade officials in heavily Republican Bergen County, which includes the Meadowlands, to support the Newark arena. In addition to the urban-suburban balancing between Newark and Bergen that is likely to be required in the Legislature, there is a north-south balancing act in which Mr. DiFrancesco will have to address southern New Jersey's quest for some kind of sports venue.</p>
        <p>The Assembly majority leader, Paul DiGaetano, who represents the Meadowlands area, said that despite all the attention on the Newark arena, what happens with the Meadowlands will have a far larger economic impact.</p>
        <p>''It's the tail wagging the dog, because the Newark arena is really the smaller of the pieces, and the Meadowlands has the capacity to be 10 times bigger,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal calls for a $355 million arena for the two sports franchises, financed with $190 million in state-issued revenue bonds that would be backed by an increase in the city sales tax to 6 percent from 3 percent. That tax would be charged by businesses within a newly created sports district in Newark. The YankeeNets would contribute $115 million to the cost of the 18,500-seat arena and be responsible for any cost overruns.</p>
        <p>The proposal requires the Republican-controlled Legislature to pass legislation creating the sports district, the sales tax increase and a bill that would encourage hotel and other construction in the city.</p>
        <p>The announcement outraged and baffled some Republicans, concerned that the acting governor was offering an economic development plum to heavily Democratic Essex County while ignoring the future of the Meadowlands in Republican Bergen.</p>
        <p>But had Mr. DiFrancesco chosen, he could have given some tantalizing and perhaps soothing hints about what is in store for the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>Lewis Eisenberg, the investment banker and prominent Republican whom Mr. DiFrancesco put in charge of negotiating with the YankeeNets and planning the future of the Meadowlands, said that only the Newark part of the equation had a July 1 deadline.</p>
        <p>But, he said, plans were progressing for a broad redevelopment plan for the Meadowlands -- a plan that envisioned its becoming a family sports, entertainment and retail destination. Progress was being made, he and others said, in talks with Nascar about the possibility of auto racing there, and the state had grown more serious about the prospect of giving the New York Jets a permanent home at the Meadowlands, along with the New York Giants, in a new stadium.</p>
        <p>In addition, a nationally known planning firm has been hired to create a vision of a new Meadowlands complex. There is also broad agreement among Republican and Democratic officials to build a rail spur that would bring two of the region's commuter lines to the Meadowlands.  ''This means weaving the Meadowlands into the fabric of everyday life in the region,'' said Arthur Maurice, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, who has been part of the negotiations on both the Newark arena and the future of the Meadowlands. ''It has always been viewed solely as an events location. But part of DiFrancesco's vision is that this can be a seven-day-a-week destination.''</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, two of the Nets' co-owners, Raymond Chambers, the philanthropist behind a host of city redevelopment plans, and Lewis Katz, have been the YankeeNets board members most committed to a Newark arena. But as talks dragged on and one proposal after another collapsed, others on the YankeeNets board have raised concerns that the teams would not have an agreement in time to meet their goal of a new arena by 2004.</p>
        <p>Harvey Schiller, the president of the YankeeNets, said the teams ''would not like to talk about deadlines,'' and refused to confirm that there was one. But left implicit in the negotiations was the possibility that if an arena could not be built by then, the two teams might leave the state.</p>
        <p>One lawmaker, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, suggested that Mr. DiFrancesco may have been acting shrewdly in not revealing more about possibilities for the Meadowlands. First, he said, Mr. DiFrancesco realized that it would be easier to draw up a plan by letting others come to him with suggestions rather than putting one forward that could be picked apart. The lawmaker added that the possibility of a Democrat in the governor's office after November gave Republicans in Bergen extra incentive to work out a deal with Mr. DiFrancesco.</p>
        <p>Still, Assemblyman DiGaetano said that it would have been helpful if he and others in Bergen had heard more about the Meadowlands' possible future amid the fanfare last week over the Newark arena.</p>
        <p>For his part, the Bergen County executive, William Shuber, said through a spokesman that he was cheered by talk of growing support for the nearly 15-year-old idea of a rail route. But the spokesman added that it would take more than talk.</p>
        <p>''He wants to see plans, a map with the routes delineated and written commitments of funding,'' said Tom Amerato, the spokesman. ''It can't be pie in the sky and a someday thing. But I think it can be done before the close of the legislative session.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2001, Wednesday  An article yesterday about plans for a Newark arena and redevelopment of the Meadowlands misspelled the name of the Bergen County executive. He is William Schuber, not Shuber.</p>
