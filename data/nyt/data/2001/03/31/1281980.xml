        <p>The unions representing New York City firefighters and officers accused the Fire Department yesterday of endangering its workers by putting new hand-held radios into service even though, the unions said, the department knew months ago that some of the radios had not worked properly during tests.</p>
        <p>The union officials said that the department had ignored concerns about the radios that were raised by officers who had been involved in trying out the new equipment during training sessions held at the Fire Academy in January and February.</p>
        <p>The new digital radios, which replaced older technology, were pulled from service last week after a distress call from a firefighter trapped in a burning house in Queens went unheard by some of his colleagues.</p>
        <p>''To knowingly put our members' safety at risk is criminal,'' said Kevin Gallagher, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, ''and whoever is to blame must be held accountable.''</p>
        <p>Peter Gorman, the president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, who presided with Mr. Gallagher at a news conference, said the situation was so serious that Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen should resign.</p>
        <p>''If firefighters attacked the flames as leisurely as the Fire Department addressed this problem, New York City would be a prairie,'' Mr. Gorman wrote in a letter to Mr. Von Essen that he distributed to reporters.</p>
        <p>Fire officials dismissed the criticism as union posturing and said that no one had been aware of any serious problems with the radios before they were distributed earlier this month. A few officers had grumbled during the academy testing that they heard echoes on the new radios or noted a half-second delay in transmission, said Francis X. Gribbon, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gribbon said those complaints were typical among firefighters who were unfamiliar with digital technology, and did not indicate that the system was malfunctioning. He said the department did become concerned about the radios last week, when it became clear in at least two incidents, including the Queens fire, that transmissions had not been heard. Even in those cases, Mr. Gribbon said, the department believed the radios simply needed to be reprogrammed, not repaired.</p>
        <p>''Whatever the problems are, they are solvable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The city bought the radios under a 1997 contract with Motorola Inc. that is worth about $33 million and is intended to provide the department with a system that would improve the clarity of voice transmission and help firefighters communicate better when working inside buildings. Of the $33 million, about $18 million was allotted for the purchase of 3,818 hand-held radios to be used by firefighters and ambulance crews.</p>
        <p>The contract was awarded without bidding, fire officials said, because the department determined that the Motorola radios were the only ones that met their needs. A Motorola spokesman said the furor over the new radios largely stemmed from the fact that the firefighters were not accustomed to the different characteristics of digital technology.</p>
        <p>''The radios did not malfunction or fail,'' said Steve Gorecki, the spokesman. ''They worked and are working according to the specifications. That has been acknowledged by the Fire Department.''</p>
        <p>Union officials, however, have said that dozens of firefighters and officers have complained about the new radios. At least a half-dozen of the complaints surfaced weeks ago, they said, when about 80 fire companies were asked to use the new radios during the training sessions. The complaints extended beyond the echo or delay issues cited by the department, the officials said, and included reports of lost messages.</p>
        <p>The city began using the new radios on March 14, and Mr. Gribbon said that there had been only a few reports of lost messages in the period they were in use, during which 81 fires were reported. In the Queens fire, the firefighter who gave the distress call suffered minor smoke inhalation before he escaped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorman, the president of the  officers' union, said that one officer had approached Assistant Fire Commissioner Stephen M. Gregory, who supervises the Bureau of Fire Communications, two months ago to report the problems and ask if he should file a written report. Mr. Gorman reported that Mr. Gregory replied that the problems were ''inherent with the technology,'' and then said, ''I don't need a written report.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory could not be reached for comment. Fire officials said that Mr. Gregory had told them that the only complaints that had reached him concerned the echo and delay issues, which the department had expected. In fact, Mr. Gribbon said, those issues were so anticipated that the department had addressed them in a training video on the new radios that it sent to every fire company in the city.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, no written report that evaluated how the radios fared during the training sessions at the Fire Academy appears to have been written, fire officials said.</p>
