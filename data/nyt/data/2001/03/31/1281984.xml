        <p>A city Department of Transportation employee was arrested on Thursday and accused of seeking a bribe during the Manhattan Bridge reconstruction project, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The employee, Nanda Chakravartti, the engineer in charge of the $127 million project, asked for a 1 percent payoff in August 1999 from a contractor working on the project, in return for helping the company increase its profits by using more of its workers, said Edward J. Kuriansky, commissioner of the Department of Investigation. A law enforcement official said that investigators had not fixed a specific dollar amount to the bribe, but that it would have run into the ''tens of thousands.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Chakravartti, 54, who earned more than $75,000 a year and has been suspended without pay, was hired by the Transportation Department as a civil engineer in 1994 and was the engineer in charge of the Brooklyn Bridge reconstruction project in 1997.</p>
        <p>The engineer, who lives in Cherry Hill, N.J., was arrested after an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office and the Department of Investigation. He was charged with bribe-receiving in the third degree, a felony, and criminal solicitation and official misconduct, both misdemeanors. If convicted, he faces up to seven years in prison, the authorities said.</p>
