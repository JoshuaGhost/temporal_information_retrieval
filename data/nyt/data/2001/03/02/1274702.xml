        <p>AUTO safety experts and lawmakers are increasingly talking about the hazards of driving while using a cellular phone, but a survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety suggests that drivers do not really need phones to be distracted. The car's radio may be enough.</p>
        <p>In November, the foundation, an affiliate of the AAA automobile club, asked visitors to its Web site to answer two questions: What model year is your car? How many buttons are on the radio?</p>
        <p>The 1,800 responses show a trend. Among pre-1990 cars, 70 percent had fewer than than 11 buttons for the sound system. For 2001 models, only 35 percent had fewer than 11 buttons. ''Driver distraction is an important cause of crashes, and one of the biggest distractions is tuning the radio,'' said David Willis, the foundation's president.</p>
        <p>The foundation's measure is a crude one, especially since some designers have reduced the number of buttons by putting some controls into menus, so that the user has to scroll through several lists to find the desired function; for example, a driver may have to hit a button repeatedly to find the adjustments for the bass or treble, or the left-right speaker balance. The process may lure drivers into what psychologists call cognitive capture, in which people do not move on to the next task until the first one is done -- even if they are driving at the time.</p>
        <p>Radios are a longstanding distraction. It is difficult even to count all the newer electronic devices that are either installed in cars, like sound systems with AM and FM bands, CD and tape players and satellite navigation systems, or that can be used in cars, like cell phones and Web-enabled personal digital assistants like Palm Pilots.</p>
        <p>The Intelligent Transportation Society of America, a group that tries to set standards for what is broadly called telematics -- the consumer products and services that can be used in cars -- said last month, when it announced a conference on ''driver focus,'' that the market was exploding. It cited an estimate by the International Data Corporation that the market would grow to $42 billion in 2010, from $1 billion in 1998.</p>
        <p>Auto designers say they are not in the driver's seat in this trend.</p>
        <p>''Every time there's a feature, you need an interface, a button or a collection of buttons,'' said Dr. Brian Peacock, who recently retired from General Motors, where he had worked as manager of human factors in advanced vehicle engineering. ''There is a tremendous demand from the customer for new features, like a cell phone, or a 'his and hers' heating system, a CD and a tape player. It's not just that car companies are thrusting buttons at people.''</p>
        <p>But design is improving, he said; in the early days, engineers liked rows of identical buttons; later designs stress controls that are easier to differentiate.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peacock divided the driver workload into primary, secondary and tertiary functions. Primary would be using the steering wheel and pedals and looking through the windows; secondary would be using the turn signals, lights, windshield wipers and washers. Tertiary would be ''entertainment and communications features,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you get a tertiary device, you get increased workload, which is more likely to have interference with the primary task,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the designer's problem is complicated by differences among drivers, he said. Younger drivers are better able to balance between tertiary and primary tasks, he said, and want the extra features.</p>
        <p>But even some aficionados say consumers may have reached overload. Mike Metter, editor of Car Stereo Review's Mobile Entertainment and a self-described ''road gear-aholic,'' complained about the profusion of controls and suggested that ''all vehicle operators, no matter what the situation, should be considered 'designated drivers.' ''</p>
        <p>''If you want to watch a movie, play a video game, call your stockbroker or check your e-mail while you're in a moving car, then don't drive it,'' he wrote in an article on the Web site (www.m-emag.com).</p>
        <p>Some automakers have tried to make the driver's access to tertiary functions easier, in a way that can lead to more complicated displays. ''I think we're finding, from a customer convenience standpoint, they like to have redundant, frequently used controls on the steering wheel,'' said David H. Hoffmeister, a human factors specialist at Ford.</p>
        <p>The technology is advancing in ways that could help or hurt, or both.</p>
        <p>For example, Rajarathnam Chandramouli, an assistant professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., cited new standards for short-range wireless communications that will let common electronic devices talk to one another.</p>
        <p>''Let's say I want to make a phone call, and the phone number is in my Palm Pilot, sitting somewhere. So I tell the cell phone, 'Dial this number,' '' he said. ''What will happen is the cell phone and the Palm Pilot can be connected.''</p>
        <p>A consortium founded in 1998 that now includes 3Com, Ericsson, Intel, I.B.M., Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia and Toshiba has agreed to a single standard for such communications. A driver could conceivably place a call without having to fumble through a Palm Pilot to find the number -- or without pulling off the road.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chandramouli said that however the call was placed, having a telephone conversation while at the wheel may not be a good idea. Some studies show that the act of talking, even without having to dial or hold a phone, can be distracting. ''When you have buttons it distracts you all the more,'' he said. ''But when you don't have buttons, it still does not solve all the problems.''</p>
        <p>Some carmakers have taken steps to reduce the hazard. Jaguar's navigation system gives the driver oral instructions from a computerized voice. The driver can enter any destination to receive instructions, but only when the gearshift is in park.</p>
        <p>Even oral instructions may prove distracting. To find out, and to develop a more scientific study than asking people to count the buttons on their radios, the AAA safety foundation recently hired Dr. Mustapha Mouloua, of the Center for Advanced Transportation Systems Simulation at the University of Central Florida, to develop a driving simulator. He will measure the distractions caused by a variety of devices and situations, including a driver alone with a cell phone, a radio and a navigation system, and a passenger using those devices while the driver tries to pay attention to the road.</p>
        <p>''We're creating all these technical systems and they're supposed to help us, but sometimes they overload us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 9, 2001, Friday  The Safety column of the Automobiles section on March 2 about the complexity of car radios misstated the surname of the editor of Mobile Entertainment magazine, who complained about the profusion of controls. He is Mike Mettler, not Metter.</p>
