        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: REPORTER'S ARREST SOUGHT -- The prosecutor in the trial of Sean Combs, left, sought to have a New York Post reporter arrested yesterday, but backed down by day's end. The prosecutor, Matthew Bogdanos, wanted the reporter to testify about an article in which he had quoted a nightclub owner saying that Mr. Combs's representatives had offered to increase his business in exchange for the owner's help in Mr. Combs's trial. Michael Bergos, who owns the nightclub, Club New York, where the incident central to the trial took place, has denied saying that to the reporter, Daniel Jeffreys. The Post cited state law covering a reporter's confidentiality privilege and the hardship of Mr. Jeffreys's having to leave his two sick children at home in Maryland to go to New York to testify.

        <p>MONTICELLO: CAMERAS ALLOWED AT TRIAL -- In a further challenge to a state law barring cameras from courtrooms, a trial judge has opened a death penalty trial to still cameras. The Sullivan County judge, Frank J. LaBuda, has approved a request by The Times Herald-Record of Middletown to send photographers to cover the murder trial of Anthony Schroedel in Monticello. Judge LaBuda's decision applies to pretrial hearings that are to begin tomorrow. He cited a decision last year allowing cameras at the trial of New York City police officers charged in the death of Amadou Diallo.  Laura Mansnerus (NYT)</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: FIRE IN HARLEM BUILDING -- A three-alarm fire in an apartment building in Harlem last night routed at least 12 people from their homes and left a firefighter with second-degree burns on his leg, fire officials said. The fire, at 2496 Eighth Avenue near 133rd Street, started in a vacant store on the first floor around 6:15 p.m. and soon spread to all five stories, said Firefighter Dan Lynch, a Fire Department spokesman. Twelve residents and one firefighter received minor injuries, Firefighter Lynch said, and the other injured firefighter, whose leg was burned, was taken to the New York Weill Cornell Center.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEW ANTISMOKING CAMPAIGN -- The New York City Health Department is starting an advertising campaign intended to encourage smokers to quit. The television and radio advertisements, which are to begin this week, encourage people who are thinking of quitting to call a special line, (888) 609-6292, for information. The department has already placed posters in Spanish in public spaces with the same information.  Jennifer Steinhauer (NYT)</p>
        <p>MOREAU: FEWER MILITARY EXERCISES IN PARKS -- The National Guard will not be allowed to use state parks as military training grounds following a controversy last May, when picnickers at Moreau State Park in Saratoga County were startled to see soldiers driving vehicles equipped with machine guns in the woods. National Guard members will still be able to use the parks for search-and-rescue exercises or aerial firefighting, said Scott Sandman, a spokesman for the State Division of Military and Naval Affairs. But drills that include weapons of any kind will not be permitted.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: NURSING HOME CONTRACTS -- Workers at three nursing homes in the Catholic Health System of Western New York have overwhelmingly approved a new contract, their unions announced yesterday. Under the agreement, a master contract will cover workers at St. Mary's Manor in Niagara Falls, St. Francis Nursing Home in Williamsville and the McAuley Residence in Kenmore. Officials with 1199 Upstate of the Service Employees International Union said the workers would get better health benefits and major wage increases.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: CITY SEES DEFICIT -- Hartford's city manager has instituted a hiring freeze and a moratorium on borrowing to deal with a potential $17 million budget shortfall. City officials say they need $15.4 million to pay the bills for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Overtime costs for the police could add $1.9 million to the shortfall.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>PRINCETON: DEER HUNT ENDS -- Having killed 322 deer in about two weeks, professional sharpshooters have ended their work in Princeton. Phyllis Marchand, the mayor of Princeton, said Monday that the township had a permit to use the sharpshooters, employed by White Buffalo, a Connecticut wildlife management firm, until March 31, but no further hunts were planned.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: FINANCIER'S TRIAL TO BEGIN -- Jury selection is to begin today in the trial of Robert E. Brennan, left, the bankrupt financier, who faces charges of trying to hide $4.5 million in assets from creditors. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will begin paring down the jury pool in Federal District Court in Trenton. Mr. Brennan was indicted in November on charges that he failed to report $4 million in bonds and $500,000 in gambling winnings.</p>
        <p>Steve Strunsky (NYT)</p>
        <p>LIVINGSTON: TEENAGER IN BOMB CASE -- One of two teenagers accused of carrying a homemade bomb into a Livingston school last month has been allowed to return home. The youth, 14, whose name has not been released, is required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet and one parent must be with him at all times. He will not be allowed to return to Mount Pleasant Middle School until officials decide if both youths should be suspended or expelled. The other youth, also 14, who is said to have possessed the bomb, will stay at the Essex County Youth House until his criminal case is complete.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>CALENDAR  Tomorrow</p>
        <p>ELECTION REFORM HEARING -- The New York State Assembly has scheduled a public hearing on improving municipal and state elections. Room 1923, 19th floor, 250 Broadway, Manhattan, 10:30 a.m. Information: (518) 455-3888.</p>
