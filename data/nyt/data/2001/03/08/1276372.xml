        <p>World Wrestling Federation Entertainment is not abandoning its partnership in the XFL with NBC, Linda McMahon, the company's president, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Comments attributed to her from an investment conference held Monday were taken out of context to make it seem as if W.W.F.E. were looking to bail out of the XFL after this season, an XFL spokesman said.</p>
        <p>''While the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment continues to evaluate the XFL on a weekly basis,'' McMahon said in a statement, ''we stand committed to our long-term goal of making the XFL a viable brand of alternative football.''</p>
        <p>The XFL's Nielsen rating on NBC last Saturday fell to a 2.4, from a 2.6 the previous week, the smallest drop since the season began.</p>
