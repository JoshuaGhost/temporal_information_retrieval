        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN RHAPSODY,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Starring KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler. In its lighthearted giddiness, this show looks back in spirit to ''My One and Only,'' Tommy Tune's fluffy 1983 Broadway tribute to Gershwin. It's when it tries to be genuinely rhapsodic that it gets into trouble. Thursday and Friday nights at 8; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN RHAPSODY,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Starring KT Sullivan and Mark Nadler. In its lighthearted giddiness, this show looks back in spirit to ''My One and Only,'' Tommy Tune's fluffy 1983 Broadway tribute to Gershwin. It's when it tries to be genuinely rhapsodic that it gets into trouble. Thursday and Friday nights at 8; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Ms. Andreas's new show is a likable tribute to the great divas of Broadway, from Helen Morgan through Ethel Merman to Barbra  Streisand, with special affection lavished on Julie Andrews, who originated the role of  Eliza Doolittle that made Ms. Andreas a star in a revival of ''My Fair Lady.'' In certain cases, (Merman, for example), Ms. Andreas inflects her voice in a subtle imitation of the legend being remembered. But for the most part she remains the eternal ing√©nue, her beautiful voice with its hummingbird vibrato caressing ballads like ''They Say It's Wonderful'' and ''Bill.'' Lee Musiker's gorgeous pop-jazz piano helps loosen things up. Through April 7. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Music charge: $60; dinner is available from 6:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>* ROSEMARY CLOONEY, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Inspired by the Big Kahuna and the Copa Cat Pack, a lusty 12-member swing band from Hawaii, Ms. Clooney is sounding more robust than she has in years. Her new show, ''Sentimental Journey,'' is an intimate scrapbook of memories (of Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Tony Pastor, among others) that interweaves songs with salty but sentimental anecdotes. High points include a pensive ''Happiness Is Just a Thing Called Joe'' (in tribute to her ''favorite singer,'' Mildred Bailey), an accelerated ''Ol' Man River'' and a chin-up version of Mildred Bailey's signature song, ''Rockin' Chair.'' Not a false emotional note is struck. Through April 7. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:30. Tuesdays through Thursdays, $60 cover and $50 minimum; Fridays and Saturdays, $75 cover and a $50 minimum. Friday and Saturday nights at 11, Big Kahuna and the Copa Cat Pack play alone. No cover or minimum for the late shows.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, focusing on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Ronny Whyte, a pianist and singer, joins Tom Postilio and Hilary Kole. Mr. Whyte conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. He concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Postilio on the dreamy 1940's singer of ballads, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. This memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside, $75 and $80.</p>
        <p>ARCI'S PLACE, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Margaret Whiting and Paul Bernhardt. Tuesday through Thursday nights at 7; Friday and Saturday nights at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Through April 7.</p>
        <p>CAFE PIERRE, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, (212) 940-8195. Kathleen Landis, singer and pianist. Tuesdays through Saturday nights from 8:30 to 11:30; until 12:30 on weekends. Nancy Winston, singer and pianist. Sunday and Monday nights from 8:30 to 11:30. No cover; $20 minimum.</p>
