        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>SCHOOLS EVACUATED  About 6,000 schoolchildren in Hastings-on-Hudson and Poughkeepsie were sent home yesterday after bomb threats were made in their districts. No explosives or suspicious packages were found. John J. Russell, the superintendent of the Hastings schools, said the police traced a threatening phone call that came into an elementary school.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: SANCTIONS OVER SURGERIES  The New York State Health Department said yesterday that it would take action against a Queens home for the mentally ill, where some residents endured what the state called ''assembly line'' prostate surgery. The department said it would seek to revoke the license of the operator of the Leben Home for Adults, in Elmhurst, which remains open but cannot admit new residents. The operator, Jacob Rubin, has denied involvement in the surgeries and is expected to oppose the revocation.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: C.C.R.B. DELAYS VOTE  The Civilian Complaint Review Board has postponed a special meeting scheduled for today to vote on proposed rules to expand its powers. That postponement makes it unlikely that the agency, which investigates complaints of police abuse, will be able to take on its new powers by May 7, as the Giuliani administration had hoped. The vote will probably be held on April 11 at the agency's regular monthly meeting.</p>

        <p>BRONX: STUDENT ACCUSED IN ATTACK ON NUN  A Bronx high school student was arrested yesterday after she assaulted a 70-year-old nun who told her she could not drink coffee in the school's computer room, the police said. The student, Litsa Kollaris, 17, was charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, after the incident at Monsignor Scanlon High School. The nun, Sister Jane Tyler, suffered back injuries and a possible concussion. She was being treated yesterday at Jacobi Medical Center.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEWSSTAND CONTRACT  The Newspaper Guild has reached a tentative contract for 325 newly unionized workers at Hudson News, a chain of newsstands. The agreement calls for raises of 12.5 percent and 20 percent over four years and a no-layoff clause for workers with more than 15 years of service. The tentative settlement, to be voted on Monday, would also reduce workers' contributions to their health insurance by up to 40 percent.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CONVICTION IS REVERSED  An appeals court yesterday overturned the conviction of a former Wall Street executive who was accused of giving inside stock information to an X-rated movie actress. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered a new trial for the executive, James McDermott Jr., finding insufficient evidence to convict him of conspiracy but adequate evidence for other charges. Mr. McDermott  had been sentenced to eight months in prison.</p>

        <p>UNION: COUPLE ACCUSED IN BOY'S DEATH  A Hunterdon County couple have been indicted on manslaughter charges in the death of their adopted son, a 7-year-old boy from Siberia. The couple, Robert and Brenda Matthey, had already been charged with child endangerment after the boy, Viktor Alexander Matthey, died on Oct. 31. Prosecutors said the boy died from complications of hypothermia and was kept in an unheated basement. Lawyers for the couple, who are free on $30,000 bail each, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>

        <p>HOBOKEN: SECOND HUDSON FERRY TO BEGIN  Another Hudson ferry will begin service Monday, said New York Waterway, the ferry's operator. This one will run from 14th Street in Hoboken to 38th Street in Manhattan, the company said. Hoboken already has a ferry that docks at a downtown slip at the Erie-Lackawanna Terminal. The new service will be free for two weeks, then cost $4 one way or $140 for a monthly pass.</p>

        <p>JERSEY CITY: SCHUNDLER ANSWERS CRITIC  Mayor Bret D. Schundler denied yesterday that he had misused a nonprofit fund for political purposes. Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, a rival of Mr. Schundler's for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, has asked for an investigation into $773,000 worth of ads for a fund established by Mr. Schundler to promote state tax credits for those who contribute to college scholarships.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: THEFT INQUIRY AT AIRPORTS  A nearly yearlong probe into thefts of money by parking-lot attendants at New York's Kennedy International Airport has spread to La Guardia and Newark International Airport, where investigators said they found similar thefts. The initial investigation uncovered $47,000 in thefts at Kennedy and resulted in 16 arrests. The private contractors who run the parking lots at all three airports are cooperating in the investigation, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates all three airports.</p>

        <p>GREENWICH: LAWYER APPOINTED FOR BABY  The State of Connecticut has appointed a lawyer to represent the interests of a newborn  abandoned in the rain on the side of a road. The lawyer, David Marantz, said his role was more like that of a guardian than that of a typical lawyer. The boy, still unnamed, was abandoned March 22 only hours after he was born, the police said. The baby could be placed in foster care today, Mr. Marantz said.</p>
        <p>Hope Reeves (NYT)</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: MILLSTONE LAWSUIT DISMISSED  A State Superior Court judge has thrown out a lawsuit by antinuclear groups to stop the $1.3 billion sale of the Millstone nuclear power complex to a Virginia company. The Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone failed to establish legal standing to pursue its claims in court, Judge Peter Emmett Wise ruled Wednesday. The coalition failed to prove that it would be harmed financially if Northeast Utilities sold the Waterford plant to Dominion Resources Inc., Judge Wise found.</p>
