        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Newest Immigrants Head Straight to New Jersey's Suburbs'' (news article, March 10) captures an aspect of American life that is a reality to those of us who speak at colleges and schools. Immigrants are not only settling into suburbs and other places, but they are also eager to let America know who they are.</p>
        <p>When I spoke recently to groups of New Jersey students, I told them how I traced my ancestors back 15 generations and to three continents. They were then eager to hear from one another about their own backgrounds and family cultures.</p>
        <p>With each remixing of the cultural groups within a community, people need to talk about their humanity as well as each group's uniqueness and history. Emphasize the similarities, and it's easy to offset the differences.</p>
