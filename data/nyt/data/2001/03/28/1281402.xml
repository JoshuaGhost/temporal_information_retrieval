        <p>Cable's E! pre-Oscar special, starring Joan Rivers and her daughter, draws slightly larger audience than it did in 2000 (S)</p>

        <p>Cable's E! television network did a better job holding on to its audience on Oscar night than did ABC, whose ratings for the Academy Awards broadcast Sunday night were the lowest yet. E!'s outrageous pre-awards special, starring the comedian Joan Rivers and her daughter Melissa, drew a slightly larger audience than it did in 2000. Still, size is relative when comparing network audiences with those of cable television. E!'s ''Live from the Red Carpet: The 2001 Academy Awards'' was watched by 3.1 million people, up from just over 3 million in 2000. The ABC Oscar broadcast, on the other hand, was watched by 42.9 million people, down from 46.3 million last year. ABC, meanwhile, may in large part have HBO's ''Sopranos'' to blame for the Academy Awards' ratings decline. ''The Sopranos'' was watched by 7.4 million people on Sunday at 9 p.m., or by about 2 million more than watched ''The Sopranos'' on Oscar night last year. That could account for a large portion of the ceremony's defectors.</p>
