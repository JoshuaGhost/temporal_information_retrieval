        <p>A 20-year-old murder suspect was killed in a wild gun battle with the police here early today, several hours after a feud between Hackensack's police chief and the Bergen County prosecutor had interfered with the search for the suspect.</p>
        <p>After the gunfight, in which the suspect fired dozens of bullets from an AK-47 rifle, the police chief, Charles Zisa, and the prosecutor, William H. Schmidt, became involved in a personal and public squabble. The two men, who have a history of strained relations, accused one another of starting a jurisdictional dispute early Monday that led to the removal of Hackensack police officers and detectives from the hunt for the suspect, Najee T. Brown.</p>
        <p>Hackensack's mayor, John F. Zisa, the chief's brother, stepped into the dispute this afternoon by asking New Jersey's acting governor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, and the attorney general, John J. Farmer, to suspend Mr. Schmidt while the state investigated the rift.</p>
        <p>''What the prosecutor did here is mind-boggling, and seriously calls into question his competency to continue in his position,'' Mayor Zisa said. ''He literally put the people of our community at risk.''</p>
        <p>The State Division of Criminal Justice, a branch of Mr. Farmer's office, plans to review the mayor's complaint, said a spokeswoman, Emily Hornaday. She called such a review routine, adding that state law enforcement officials hoped that the two men would ''begin to repair a damaged relationship for the betterment of the community.''</p>
        <p>During a news conference this afternoon, Chief Zisa contended that early Monday morning, Mr. Schmidt ordered the Hackensack police removed from both the search for Mr. Brown and the investigation into the Sunday night killing of a 19-year-old Hackensack man, Ryan Travis, in a rooming house on Central Avenue. Investigators considered Mr. Brown  a prime suspect.</p>
        <p>''We feel his irresponsible and inexcusable actions created a climate for this tragedy to occur,'' Chief Zisa said of the prosecutor. ''It's unconscionable they'd leave this guy out there by blocking us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt denounced the chief's accusation as ''absolutely and categorically untrue.'' He said Chief Zisa withdrew the officers from the case, an accusation the chief denied.</p>
        <p>The dispute began about 4 a.m. Monday, about seven hours after Mr. Travis was fatally shot twice in the chest as he and Mr. Brown argued in the hallway of the rooming house, according to the authorities. In the pre-dawn hours, Mr. Schmidt and Chief Zisa said, a witness was found and was about to be questioned.</p>
        <p>An argument developed about whether the witness would be taken to Hackensack police headquarters or the offices of Mr. Schmidt's homicide squad, about a mile away. Mr. Schmidt's aides said today that the squad's office was more suitable because there were stenographers and several interview rooms there.</p>
        <p>Chief Zisa said the issue of which office to use was insignificant to him.  But, he said, he asked Mr. Schmidt to explain why the questioning could not be done at Police Headquarters.  He quoted the prosecutor as responding, '' 'This is not a debate.' '' Then, Chief Zisa said, Mr. Schmidt ordered the Hackensack police off the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt offered a different version of the conversation. ''He said unless it were done his way he would pull his people and conduct a parallel investigation and then it would be a race to see who got to the witnesses and suspect first,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt said he then called the state attorney general's office and received permission to formally supersede the Hackensack police  and take control of the investigation.</p>
        <p>After receiving a formal letter from Mr. Schmidt, the Hackensack police dropped out of the search, said Chief Zisa, who insisted that they had been ousted.</p>
        <p>He said Hackensack detectives considered Mr. Brown a suspect in the killing and started looking for him. ''But we didn't look for him all day Monday,'' the chief said.</p>
        <p>About 3:30 this morning, Mr. Brown returned to the Central Avenue home where Mr. Travis was fatally shot and began firing the AK-47 into the building and into the air, the authorities said. Eight police officers -- five from Hackensack and three from the Bergen County Police Department -- exchanged gunfire with Mr. Brown, who may have fired as many as 100 shots at buildings and the police before being killed, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 22, 2001, Thursday  A headline yesterday about a murder suspect in New Jersey who was killed in a gun battle with the police referred incorrectly in some copies to the Bergen County official involved in a jurisdictional dispute with the Hackensack police chief about the case. It was the county prosecutor, not the sheriff.</p>
