        <p>THE SETTING -- On Monday night, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton climbed up to the pulpit at Plymouth Church on Orange Street to address the annual meeting of the Brooklyn Heights Association. The pews in the 2,000-seat church -- a refuge for runaway slaves in the 19th century, under Henry Ward Beecher -- were stuffed with duck boots, dark suits and damp wool. Outside the snow came softly, sparsely down.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton deftly wove her way through local issues like the Brooklyn waterfront park and the city's water supply. ''I occasionally do draw some press attention, so if there is a way that can be useful instead of the bane of my existence, feel free to use me,'' she said. Flashbulbs popped. Laughter bounced off the Italianate columns.</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- On Monday night, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton climbed up to the pulpit at Plymouth Church on Orange Street to address the annual meeting of the Brooklyn Heights Association. The pews in the 2,000-seat church -- a refuge for runaway slaves in the 19th century, under Henry Ward Beecher -- were stuffed with duck boots, dark suits and damp wool. Outside the snow came softly, sparsely down.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton deftly wove her way through local issues like the Brooklyn waterfront park and the city's water supply. ''I occasionally do draw some press attention, so if there is a way that can be useful instead of the bane of my existence, feel free to use me,'' she said. Flashbulbs popped. Laughter bounced off the Italianate columns.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton moved on to President Bush's tax cut (nay), prescription coverage under Medicare (yea), and drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge (nay). Forty minutes later, she was on her way back to Washington.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''We were shooting spitballs and stuff from the back,'' said William Detwiler, a banker in a green Vail Resorts baseball cap.</p>
        <p>But Mark Agger, a friend of Mr. Detwiler, made clear his take on the audience. ''This is like the most solid, staunch, liberal, educated group in America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Geracioti, another friend of the two who works on Wall Street, clarified the point. ''We're liberal in the true sense of the word. Eighteenth-century liberalism. Thomas Jefferson.'' How many kids you have in your school should not be a federal issue, he said.</p>
        <p>It was clear, though, that Mrs. Clinton was on home turf. ''It was like a wave of love when she came in,'' said Beth Taubner, who owns a branding strategy firm.</p>
        <p>But there was also some criticism. ''I think she became a senator because she had that name, Clinton,'' said Esta Gildwarg, a retired assistant principal.</p>
        <p>''She's definitely not middle class,'' said a social worker, who asked not to be identified. ''She's royalty.''</p>
