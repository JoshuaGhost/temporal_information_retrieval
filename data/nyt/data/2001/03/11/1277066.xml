        <p>WHEN Karen Fletcher worked on an information phone line in east central Illinois as a Master Gardener volunteer seven years ago, she became all too aware of the difficulties in quickly finding high-quality horticultural information.</p>
        <p>In the best garden tradition of sharing, Ms. Fletcher decided to do something about it. So she created the Garden Gate (garden-gate. prairienet.org), a Web site that is an easy-to-use table of contents to what she considers the best garden information resources on the Web. Although the site is recommended by many other gardening Web sites, many gardeners seem to be unaware of it. But it is such a valuable resource that it should be better known.</p>
        <p>The site not only presents brief descriptions about other Web sites but also provides links to them. It is unusual in that its only purpose is to guide readers to other Web sites.</p>
        <p>For her work, Ms. Fletcher was given the Gardener of the Year award in 1996 by the Master Gardeners of Illinois. If I could, I would also bestow an award. I find her site to be a superb resource, especially at this snowbound time of year when I dream of adding new plants to my garden and need information not only about their growing requirements but also about where to find them.</p>
        <p>As a noncommercial service, Ms. Fletcher's site does not carry advertising. And while there are some commercial sites among her recommendations, she said, ''I only list those that carry a substantial information payload.''</p>
        <p>The site's home page is organized into eight broad topic areas and one specific to east central Illinois. The topics cover the gamut of gardening interests, including publications, supplies, tours and private gardens.</p>
        <p>I find two of these areas -- the Teaching Garden and the Gardener's Reading Room -- quite attractive during winter months. Clicking on the Teaching Garden transports me to a section containing six broad categories: databases, glossaries, FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions), special-topic Web pages, collections and plant lists. The section can keep the information-hungry busy for quite a while.</p>
        <p>The Gardener's Reading Room provides descriptions and links to magazines, catalogs, and book sources and reviews. I particularly enjoy reading two sites under Catalog Information.</p>
        <p>The first is the Plants by Mail FAQ (pbmfaq.dvol.com). It gives information about the trials, tribulations and successes of ordering plants by mail and is especially useful for those who have not previously purchased plants this way. It then provides an alphabetical list of hundreds of mail order nurseries, with links to many of them, as well as reader's comments on the type of service provided by various concerns.</p>
        <p>The second mail order information site, Cyndi's Catalog of Garden Catalogs (www.qnet.com/johnsonj/), presents an address list of more than 1,900 companies. The site is organized by type of plant (perennials, bulbs and so forth) and also provides a section on other garden links.</p>
        <p>It was there, under the heading Organizations and Societies, that I found the New Plant Page (www.newplantpage.com), a Web site created by the New Ornamentals Society.</p>
        <p>This is a place where horticulturists, taxonomists, landscape designers, and now plant nuts like me can learn about the best and newest ornamental plants. Thousands are listed alphabetically by botanical name and are often accompanied by a picture or a source.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fletcher updates her Garden Gate site five or six times a year, often with material submitted by readers. ''The most exciting change since I started,'' she said, ''is the increasing number of plant databases available online. These offer the ability to search by multiple criteria, something that no text-based resource can offer.''</p>
        <p>One of the best web content resources, Ms. Fletcher says, is Ohio State University's Factsheet Database (plantfacts.osu.edu/). It contains more than 20,000 pages of fact sheets provided by 46 universities and government institutions across the United States and Canada. Searches can be conducted by key words or geographical regions or both.</p>
        <p>An exciting new resource, Ms. Fletcher said, will be the national botanical digital library being developed at the University of Illinois.</p>
        <p>''The potential is enormous,'' she said. ''In a few years, gardeners and science teachers will be able to search multiple scientific databases through a single Web-based interface.''</p>
        <p>Having witnessed the impressive rise of the Garden.com online retail operation -- which had a customer base of more than a million -- and its closing early last December, Ms. Fletcher said she does not expect to see new online gardening businesses.</p>
        <p>In contrast, she said, high-quality noncommercial sites have shown enormous staying power. ''Running off volunteer time, without fancy graphics or flashy designs, they have concentrated on delivering content,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Somewhat paradoxically, Ms. Fletcher said she finds that many gardeners spend too much time on the Internet. ''They will spend hours online hunting for information,'' she said, ''when a phone call to their county extension office would provide answers to questions in minutes.''</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, where I live, I have found it impossible to locate my county extension office. It is not listed under federal, state or local government headings in phone books.  But Ms. Fletcher has solved that problem for me. By clicking the Teaching Garden topic area on her home page, I can be linked to a site that gives information on extension offices throughout the country.</p>
        <p>''Someone once described the Internet as the largest information gift in the history of the world,'' Ms. Fletcher said. ''I certainly believe that's true in the horticulture area.''</p>
