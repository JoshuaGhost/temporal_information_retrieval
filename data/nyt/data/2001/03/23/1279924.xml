        <p>Jump onto Amazon.com's video store and call up ''Hanna's War'' (1988), based on the diaries of Hanna Senesh (Maruschka Detmers), a young Hungarian Jew executed by the Nazis, or ''The Big Knife,'' Robert Aldrich's acclaimed 1955 potboiler about a Hollywood superstar (Jack Palance) who defies a studio boss (Rod Steiger). Along with about 100 other titles, the films have landed in Amazon's MGM Movie Vault, an accumulation of old movies that have either never been on video before or, like these two, have been out of circulation for a while.</p>
        <p>Of the hundreds of movies missing on video, why these? ''We checked our search logs and saw films people were looking for,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive. With a library of thousands of movies, MGM has no objection to selling any or all of them, but, as has been the case since the dawn of video, suppliers need to identify what people want.</p>
        <p>''Amazon has powerful personalization,'' said Blake Thomas, a senior vice president of MGM Home Entertainment. And people who request a certain film could be attracted to similar ones. ''We found a number of MGM titles spun off the Amazon requests,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''The Big Knife,'' for example, leads to Nicolas Roeg's ''Eureka'' (1983), with Gene Hackman, and ''Psych-Out'' (1968), with Susan Strasberg and Jack Nicholson.</p>
        <p>From there the suggestions move afield. Like every movie on Amazon .com, ''The Big Knife'' is reviewed by customers. Dave Clayton of San Diego wrote: ''For anyone like myself who has a fondness for the darker 1950's productions like Don Siegel's 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or Alexander Mackendrick's 'Sweet Smell of Success' or Elia Kazan's 'Face in the Crowd,' this movie -- which might well have been called 'Faust in Bel Air' -- is an absolute must.''</p>
        <p>Or as Mr. Thomas put it, ''We look for films that are broadly appealing within this small appeal.''</p>
        <p>Studios are known for producing videos in mammoth quantities, but in this case modest demand for individual films suits MGM and Amazon, which are looking for big overall sales from a large pool of carefully selected small titles.</p>
        <p>''If you sell a few copies but do that with 10,000 titles, then you get real numbers,'' Mr. Bezos said. For MGM, manufacturing small, targeted groups of cassettes (no DVD's in this promotion) for Amazon is low risk.</p>
        <p>The site lists more than 90,000 titles and is always hungry for more. Cassettes ultimately take up space somewhere, of course. ''Distribution centers,'' Mr. Bezos said, ''but that space is so cheap it's not the issue.''</p>
        <p>Amazon, he added, does ''disproportionately well'' with obscure titles. ''We're happy if we sell a few copies a week -- that's O.K.,'' he said. Anyway, in the MGM Movie Vault (www.amazon.com/ mgmvault), the price is right: $7.99 each.</p>
