        <p>An influential Republican senator who had long been a fierce opponent of the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance bill offered the first hint of a compromise today, saying he was open to a ban on the unregulated political contributions known as soft money in return for higher limits on regulated donations.</p>
        <p>The comments by Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, were the first signs of a crack in the party's leadership, which had been solidly opposed to limiting soft money donations.</p>
        <p>As the Senate continued its freewheeling two-week debate on the bill sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russell D. Feingold, the real action on the bill appeared to be in Senate halls and behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>While Congressional aides emphasized that a deal might still prove impossible given the emotions on each side, they said that Mr. Nickles decided to go public with his willingness to compromise after a cordial behind-the-scenes meeting today with Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Mr. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nickles told reporters that he would now be willing to ''live with'' a ban on soft money -- the unlimited contributions that corporations, unions and individuals can make to political parties -- if it was coupled with an increase in the limit on hard money donations for individual candidates.</p>
        <p>''I am going to work with them on hard money,'' Mr. Nickles said. ''If you had a ban on soft money and increasing the hard money, I can see something I could live with.''</p>
        <p>There was no immediate response from the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi; from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,  who is leading Republican efforts to derail the McCain-Feingold bill; or from the White House. Aides to President Bush have said he is prepared to support a campaign finance overhaul although they have suggested he would veto the McCain-Feingold bill in its current form.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how Democrats would respond to any compromise that Mr. Nickles might find acceptable, especially if it called for a dramatic increase in the limits on hard money donations.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain has said that it was inevitable that a final bill would increase the limits, which now cap  contributions to a candidate from individuals at $1,000. Mr. Nickles suggested that the limit might be raised to $2,000 to $3,000. He said he was also interested in doubling or perhaps tripling the overall total that an individual could give to all candidates and parties from the current cap of $25,000.</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a supporter of campaign finance overhaul, said that the limits suggested by Mr. Nickles were ''way too high.''</p>
        <p>And other Democrats, like the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, have called for the current caps on hard money to remain. ''Let's not increase the hard money limits,'' Mr. Daschle said on Wednesday. ''Let's stick with what we've got and try to take that as far as we can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nickles's suggestion of a compromise may reflect a growing sense among his Senate colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, that a ban on soft money would help -- or hinder -- them equally. In the campaign before the election last November, Republicans raised slightly more soft money than Democrats while they continued to far outpace the Democrats in raising hard money -- $447 million to $270 million.</p>
        <p>His conciliatory comments may also reflect a feeling that the supporters of campaign reform have growing momentum in the Senate. In the first of two weeks of Senate floor debate, the bill's supporters have held together, defeating amendments seen as efforts to derail the overall bill by fracturing their coalition of Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Today, the supporters managed to block an amendment sponsored by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, that would have forced labor unions to issue written reports to their members on the use of dues for political activities.</p>
        <p>The 60-to-40 vote to kill the amendment came a day after the Senate defeated a related amendment by Mr. Hatch that would have required unions and public companies to get permission from their members or shareholders before using money for political purposes.</p>
        <p>The amendment today was seen as an effort to kill the overhaul bill, since many Democrats who otherwise supported McCain-Feingold would oppose any measure that limited political activities by unions, which overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>Despite their early victories, the bill's supporters acknowledge that bigger battles lay ahead -- specifically over amendments to raise the hard-money limits and over a rival campaign finance bill sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. Senator Hagel's bill would limit, but not ban, soft money donations and has the tacit support of the White House. It also includes increases in hard money limits.</p>
        <p>''We have just got past the first couple of hurdles,'' Mr. McCain said. ''We're a long way from over.''</p>
        <p>On a voice vote, the Senate amended the bill today to put limitations on a type of political advertising that has won many elections even as it has outraged the public: television and radio attack ads that smear candidates without making clear who paid for the ad time.</p>
        <p>Under the bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, candidates who ran negative advertisements about their rivals would have to make clear that they paid for the ads -- through a ''clearly identifiable photographic or similar image'' of themselves -- if they wanted to take advantage of the discounted advertising rates offered to candidates.</p>
        <p>''There is no constitutional right to a subsidized dirty political campaign,'' Mr. Wyden said. ''It is not going to be easy to skulk around, to sneak around, and to engage in these negative ads and then pretend that they are not yours.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 24, 2001, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about Senate negotiations on a campaign finance bill referred incorrectly in some copies to the state represented by Senator Chuck Hagel, who sponsored a rival bill. It is Nebraska, not Alaska.</p>
