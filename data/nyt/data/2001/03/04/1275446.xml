        <p>The disgruntled Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield said today that in a best-case scenario, he would wind up playing for the Mets, the Yankees or the Atlanta Braves this season.

        <p>The disgruntled Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield said today that in a best-case scenario, he would wind up playing for the Mets, the Yankees or the Atlanta Braves this season. But the Mets seemed like an unlikely possibility after a top Dodgers official said they are not among several teams who have dangled serious trade possibilities.</p>
        <p>''I would say that the New York Mets are not a serious player for Gary Sheffield,'' Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, said. ''We've had some fair offers, but not from the New York Mets.''</p>
        <p>Malone later canceled a scheduled meeting with Mets General Manager Steve Phillips in Port St. Lucie, where the teams played an exhibition game.</p>
        <p>Phillips shrugged off Malone's comments as ''part of the process.'' He noted that the teams have had too many conversations concerning Sheffield for the Mets to be considered bit players in the competition for him.</p>
        <p>Phillips said Malone is quite aware of what the Mets are not willing to give up for Sheffield, and Malone has a good idea of what they are willing to give up. Outfielder Jay Payton has been mentioned frequently in speculation about the trade.</p>
        <p>''This is one I'm not overly optimistic about,'' Phillips blurted as he was surrounded by reporters. ''All along I've seen this differential between what we're comfortable with and what I sense they are. So I've waited just to see if anything changed. It's not one that we're going to chase down. It's one we'll wait to see if it comes to us, and if it's the right deal. We're not going to disassemble our team.''</p>
        <p>Sheffield, who hit .325 with 43 home runs and 109 runs batted in last season in 141 games, stayed at the Dodgertown spring training base here today and continued to talk as if he would soon be a former Dodger.</p>
        <p>He held little possibility of a reconciliation, and talked optimistically about his departure from Los Angeles. He has threatened to ''speak the truth'' about the Dodgers if he isn't traded by Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''Actually I'm getting excited about the possibility that it might happen,'' he said. ''I've been looking for that fire to make me burn for this year. Just knowing I might be wearing another uniform and getting that fire burning is exciting.''</p>
        <p>Sheffield said today that it was ''real stupid'' that he had to take his pleadings for a trade this far. He was comparably critical of the Dodgers' announced intentions to seek equal value in any trade, especially in what many view as a distress sale.</p>
        <p>''A lot of teams are against trading their best player,'' Sheffield said. ''Of course, I could hit third for anybody, and there's not a lot of players who can say that.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, his daily diatribes are beginning to wear on the Dodgers, it is becoming clearer by the day. Tommy Lasorda, the club's senior vice president and former manager, said there are classier ways to seek a trade.</p>
        <p>''The way he's talking is concerning in itself,'' Lasorda said while standing near the batting cage in Port St. Lucie as the Mets took batting practice. ''If he wants to be traded, it could be handled in a much more dignified way.''</p>
        <p>Sheffield understands that he has been a disruption, but he said he has not felt secure in Los Angeles with all the trade speculation and the club's unwillingness to give him a contract extension.</p>
        <p>''I don't really concern myself with how people perceive me,'' he said. ''The only thing I concern myself with is the players. Obviously, I'm a distraction right now. They're wondering if I'm going to be here. But like I told them, I have to worry about Gary Sheffield right now.''</p>
        <p>As almost an afterthought, Sheffield said that if he could have forecast the maelstrom he has created, ''I never would have asked'' for a contract extension.</p>
        <p>Most of his teammates seem almost stoical about his talk of leaving.</p>
        <p>''The way I see it, with Sheff or without Sheff, we're going to win this season,'' the veteran outfielder F. P. Santangelo said. ''We have a great ball club with a great attitude and a great new manager. I just hope whoever our new left fielder is wants to win here.''</p>
        <p>Sheffield said at one time that he wanted to live in Los Angeles. ''Not anymore,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>Phillips, in Port St. Lucie, didn't hold out much hope that Sheffield would wind up a Met, though he said he was sure that he and Malone would speak again soon.</p>
        <p>''You have to make a calculation between risk and reward,'' Phillips said. ''We have a very strong chemistry on this team. It stems from the core nucleus on this team, and we are not going to break that up. We like our team. If this is something that fits, O.K. If it's not, that's O.K., too.''</p>
