      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In ''Following the Money, but Also the Mind'' (Feb. 11), Louis Uchitelle discussed the increasing influence of behavioral economists -- those who say economics should do more than assume that people act with rational, unemotional self-interest. The article drew varied responses from many readers. A sampling follows.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article describes a promising trend in bringing economics more in line with its true nature as a social science.</p>

        <p>In ''Following the Money, but Also the Mind'' (Feb. 11), Louis Uchitelle discussed the increasing influence of behavioral economists -- those who say economics should do more than assume that people act with rational, unemotional self-interest. The article drew varied responses from many readers. A sampling follows.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article describes a promising trend in bringing economics more in line with its true nature as a social science.</p>
        <p>The mainstream critique sounds like a tautology. It is done; therefore it is rational. The analysis that all self-destructive behavior is somehow rational makes it devoid of any real explanatory use.</p>
        <p>It will be helpful to the new breed of researchers to establish links to other heterodox schools of the discipline, such as institutional and feminist economics. These practitioners are engaged in revealing the crucial role of institutions and culture in economic behavior.</p>
        <p>For example, feminist economists attribute great importance to altruism, reciprocity and oppressive cultural norms in their analysis. It would serve behavioral economists well to study their findings more carefully. And one variable that seems to be missing from their agenda is that of power, which can make economic outcomes inefficient from a social perspective.</p>
