        <p>Wireless systems capable of tracking vehicles and people all over the planet are leaving businesses aglow with new possibilities, and some privacy advocates deeply concerned.</p>
        <p>Companies seeking to tap the commercial potential of these technologies are installing wireless location systems in vehicles, hand-held computers, cell phones -- even watchbands. Scientists have developed a chip that can be inserted beneath the skin, so that a person's location can be pinpointed anywhere.</p>
        <p>One early user of this technology is David Hancock, the owner of a small company in Dallas that installs automobile alarms. Mr. Hancock uses a wireless tracking service to monitor his fleet of six Dodge Dakota pickup trucks, and the equipment alerted him recently when one of his trucks turned up in the parking lot of the Million Dollar Saloon, a strip club.</p>
        <p>''When I signed up for this service I told my guys, 'Big Brother's keeping an eye on you, and I'm Big Brother,' '' Mr. Hancock said. ''After I fired that one fellow, you bet they all believed me.''</p>
        <p>These technologies have become one of the fastest-growing areas of the wireless communications industry. The market for location-based services is already estimated at nearly $600 million and is forecast to approach $5 billion within three years, according to IDC, a technology research company.</p>
        <p>A federal effort to make it easier to pinpoint the location of people making emergency 911 calls from mobile phones means that by next year cell phones sold in the United States will be equipped with advanced wireless tracking technology.</p>
        <p>Various plans already under way include alerting cell phone users when they approach a nearby McDonald's, telling them which items are on sale, or sending updates to travelers about hotel vacancies or nearby restaurants with available tables. One Florida company wants to provide parents with wireless watchbands that they can use to keep track of their children.</p>
        <p>But while the commercial prospects for wireless location technology may be intriguing, and the social benefits of better mobile 911 service are undisputed, privacy-rights advocates are worried.</p>
        <p>''By allowing location-based services to proliferate, we're opening the door to a new realm of privacy abuses,'' said James X. Dempsey, senior staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology. ''What if your insurer finds out you're into rock climbing or late-night carousing in the red-light district? What if your employer knows you're being treated for AIDS at a local clinic? The potential is there for inferences to be drawn about you based on knowledge of your whereabouts.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, location-based services belonged more in the realm of science fiction than to commerce. In the 1999 novel ''All Tomorrow's Parties'' by William Gibson, the writer who coined the term ''cyberspace'' back in the 1980's, malfunctioning eyeglasses with location-based technology suddenly flash up street maps of Rio de Janeiro just when other, more crucial information is needed.</p>
        <p>And although satellite-based Global Positioning System technology has been commercially available for some time for airplanes, boats, cars and hikers, companies have only recently begun manufacturing G.P.S. chips that can be embedded in wireless communications devices. G.P.S. uses satellite signals to determine geographic coordinates that indicate where the person with the receiving device is situated.</p>
        <p>Real-life improvements in the technology have come largely from research initiatives by start-up companies in the United States, Canada and Europe, and from large companies like I.B.M., which recently formed a ''pervasive computing'' division to focus on wireless technologies like location-based services.</p>
        <p>''Location technology is a natural extension of e-business,'' said Michel Mayer, general manager for pervasive computing at I.B.M. ''It's no surprise that a whole new ecology of small companies has been formed to focus on making it all more precise.''</p>
        <p>For instance, Peter Zhou helped to create a chip called Digital Angel that could be implanted beneath human skin, enabling his company to track the location of a person almost anywhere using a combination of satellites and radio technology.</p>
        <p>After all, he reasoned, wouldn't the whereabouts of an Alzheimer's patient be important to relatives? Wouldn't the government want to keep track of paroled convicts? Wouldn't parents want to know where their children are at 10 p.m., or 11 p.m., or any hour of the day?</p>
        <p>A review of Digital Angel's commercial potential, though, revealed concern over the possibility of privacy abuses. So Professor Zhou, the chief scientist for Applied Digital Solutions, a company in Palm Beach, Fla., that makes embedded devices for tracking livestock, altered his plans for Digital Angel, which is about the size of a dime, so that instead of being implanted it could be affixed to a watchband or a belt.</p>
        <p>''Embedding technology in people is too controversial,'' said Professor Zhou, a scholarly man who used to be a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart, Germany. ''But that doesn't mean a system capable of tracking people wherever they go won't have great value.''</p>
        <p>While Digital Angel is still in the prototype stage, Applied Digital Solutions is planning to make it commercially available later this year.</p>
        <p>That Professor Zhou found himself in the middle of the privacy debate is no surprise, given the growing interest in location-based services. Through the use of existing cellular communications technology or the Global Positioning System, researchers' ability to track wireless devices more precisely is growing.</p>
        <p>Some of the world's largest wireless carriers, like Verizon Wireless, Vodafone of Britain and NTT DoCoMo of Japan, are promoting the technology, in addition to dozens of small companies in the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>The SignalSoft Corporation, based in Boulder, Colo., develops software that allows tourists or business travelers to use their mobile phones to obtain information on the closest restaurants or hotels in a given city, while Cell-Loc Inc., a Canadian company, is already testing a wireless service in Austin, Tex., and in Calgary, Alberta, that, after determining a caller's location, delivers detailed driving directions.</p>
        <p>Some companies are even more ambitious. Webraska, a French company that recently secured $50 million in financing from investors in the United States and Europe, plans to map every urban area in the world and allow these maps to be retrieved in real time on wireless devices.</p>
        <p>Yet while businesses around the world seek to improve the quality of location-based services, the biggest impetus behind the advancement of the technology has come from the federal government, through its effort to improve the precision of locating wireless 911 emergency calls.  Nearly a third of the 150 million 911 calls made last year came from cell phones, according to the National Emergency Number Association.</p>
        <p>With the number of wireless users growing, the Federal Communications Commission has determined that by the end of this year carriers will need to begin equipping either cell phones or their communications networks with technology that would allow authorities to determine the location of most callers to within 300 feet, compared with current systems that can locate them within about 600 feet.</p>
        <p>Verizon Wireless and Western Wireless have chosen to develop a network-based system that pinpoints the signal on a handset using the existing cellular network to determine the location, while other carriers including Sprint PCS, Alltel and Nextel favor handsets equipped with G.P.S. chips. Supporters of the initiative, called E-911 for ''enhanced 911,'' expect the technology's precision to be even better than the federally mandated 300-foot radius.</p>
        <p>''If your cell phone is on while you're driving, we'll be able to tell which intersection you're at,'' said Mark Flolid, executive vice president of SignalSoft, a company that developed early versions of E-911 systems for wireless phone companies in Europe.</p>
        <p>While the E-911 initiative has driven wireless carriers in the United States to improve their location technology, industry groups have started to grapple with privacy issues. The Wireless Advertising Association, a group of carriers, advertising agencies and device manufacturers, encourages companies to allow consumers to choose whether they want location-based services. The association will endorse companies that adhere to the policy.</p>
        <p>And, late last year, the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a Washington group that represents several hundred wireless companies, submitted a proposal for privacy guidelines for location-based wireless services to the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
        <p>The principles of the proposal suggested that companies inform each customer about the collection and use of location-sensitive information; provide customers with the opportunity to consent to the collection of location information before it is used; ensure the security of any information collected; and provide uniform rules and privacy expectations so consumers are not confused when they travel in different regions or use different kinds of location-based services.</p>
        <p>''People are justifiably concerned with the rapidity with which this technology is being deployed,'' said Albert Gidari, a lawyer with the Seattle firm of Perkins Coie, who advised the industry association on the creation of the proposal. ''We need to assure them that there is no conspiracy to use this information in an underhanded way.''</p>
