        <p>Alex Rodriguez phoned Derek Jeter on Friday evening to explain the comments Rodriguez made in April's Esquire magazine, and while Jeter said he and Rodriguez are still friends, he did not exactly laugh off the episode.</p>
        <p>''He clarified what was said and what his intentions were,'' said Jeter, who has missed the Yankees' first three exhibition games with a sore shoulder. ''Obviously it didn't sound good, what he said, but the way I look at it is that we had an opportunity to talk about it and it's over with.''</p>
        <p>For the second time in three months, Rodriguez has been quoted as making comments that are obliquely critical of Jeter.</p>
        <p>Jeter said today that he was confused by the comments before he talked to Rodriguez Friday night, but that after talking with Rodriguez, he does not expect that Rodriguez will make similar remarks in the future.</p>
        <p>''I've known him for a long time, and we will be friends after this,'' Jeter said. ''The confusing thing is that it came out of nowhere.''</p>
        <p>Jeter deflected questions repeatedly by telling reporters that they needed to ask Rodriguez to explain his intentions or feelings. Jeter was asked if he thought Rodriguez was jealous of him, as his teammate Tino Martinez suggested Friday. ''You've got to ask him,'' Jeter said of A-Rod. ''I really can't answer for what he thinks or how he feels, and that's something you have to ask him.''</p>
        <p>Rodriguez told reporters at the Texas camp in Port Charlotte, Fla., that he and Jeter had cleared the air.</p>
        <p>Yankee officials remain confident Jeter will be playing well in advance of the regular season as he recovers from the injury. The Yankees knew about the shoulder problem at the time they agreed to give Jeter his 10-year, $189 million contract.</p>
        <p>If Jeter does not show improvement before Sunday, he will more than likely receive a cortisone shot.</p>
        <p>''If it was the regular season, he would be playing,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''But with the scenario where as long as we have the luxury of spring training, we might as well take care of it now.''</p>
