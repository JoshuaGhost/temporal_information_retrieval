        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Without taking sides, your article ''In Hopes of Reviving Donations: A Pamphlet'' (Feb. 11), demonstrates that homophobia has become so ingrained in Boy Scout leaders that they know not what they do.</p>
        <p>According to the Yankee Council executive director, Douglas Krofina, who supports the Scouts' national policy of banning anyone of homosexual orientation, ''Cutting off local funding because of a national policy is only going to hurt boys and girls, particularly in the local urban areas where children need and benefit from our programs.'' But excluding them does hurt boys of gay orientation. One wouldn't have to know that perceived sexual orientation plays a role in one-third of teenage suicides to imagine the pain these ostracized kids feel.</p>
        <p>John Andres, the Scout's lawyer, claims he is opposed to the ban, but still urges ''our local funding sources not to approve policies that in the end will only hurt children'' until such time as the ban might be lifted.</p>
        <p>While we wait, our children are being taught to fear and look down on a minority group of their friends and classmates. Ask any civil rights leader whether these children of the majority are not being harmed.</p>
