        <p>Food and Drug Administration asks Corixa Corp for more information about safety and effectiveness of Bexxar, drug that delivers radiation directly to cancer cells; action is expected to delay approval for drug for nine months, enough time for its rival, Idec Pharmaceuticals, to reach market first with similar drug it calls Zevalin (M)</p>

        <p>The Corixa Corporation, which is racing to be the first to market a drug that delivers radiation directly to cancer cells, has hit a roadblock. The company said yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration had asked for more information about the drug's safety and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>The agency's action is expected to delay approval for the Corixa drug, Bexxar, for at least nine months. That could allow a rival, Idec Pharmaceuticals, to reach the market first with a similar drug it calls Zevalin. Both drugs are aimed at non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.</p>

        <p>The Corixa Corporation, which is racing to be the first to market a drug that delivers radiation directly to cancer cells, has hit a roadblock. The company said yesterday that the Food and Drug Administration had asked for more information about the drug's safety and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>The agency's action is expected to delay approval for the Corixa drug, Bexxar, for at least nine months. That could allow a rival, Idec Pharmaceuticals, to reach the market first with a similar drug it calls Zevalin. Both drugs are aimed at non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.</p>
        <p>Steven Gillis, chairman and chief executive of Corixa, said that the company should be able to supply the data requested by the drug agency within three months and that the company was confident Bexxar would be approved.</p>
        <p>Corixa agreed to pay $900 million in stock in October to acquire Coulter Pharmaceutical, mainly to obtain Bexxar. But with approval of the drug uncertain, the wisdom of that acquisition could be open to question.</p>
        <p>Corixa, based in Seattle, said yesterday that it would also dismiss 10 to 15 percent of its 570 employees and delay some less essential research programs. Bexxar was expected to be its first major product.</p>
        <p>Corixa's shares fell $1.56, or 14 percent, to $9.50, while Idec shares rose $4.38, or 9 percent, to $52.50.</p>
        <p>Corixa and Idec are competing to reach the market with the first drug consisting of radioactive isotopes linked to monoclonal antibodies, which are engineered versions of the proteins the body uses to ward off germs. The idea is that the monoclonal antibodies will zero in on cancer cells, delivering the radioactive isotopes to kill the cells, while leaving healthy cells unscathed.</p>
        <p>In reality, some healthy cells are exposed to radiation, leading to concerns that the drugs could have harmful side effects. One interpretation of the delay for Bexxar is that the agency is being cautious with this new category of drug, and that could hurt Idec's chances as well.</p>
        <p>''It could signify that with radio-labeled antibodies the F.D.A. has raised the bar,'' said Andrew Milne, an analyst with Dain Rauscher Wessels. But Mr. Milne said he thought Idec could avoid the problems.</p>
        <p>Eric J. Ende, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, called the Bexxar delay a ''significant positive'' for Idec, predicting that Zevalin would be approved by the end of the year, ahead of Bexxar.</p>
        <p>The analysts said they thought Idec had submitted the type of data the drug agency was seeking from Corixa, such as a comparison of the radioactive antibody versus the antibody without the isotope. The drug agency also wants to make sure that three versions of the Bexxar antibody made by different manufacturers are comparable. Idecs antibodies come from the same factory.</p>
        <p>Bexxar was once way ahead Zevalin. But Coulter's first application for marketing approval, filed in 1999, was not even accepted for review. Coulter filed again for approval last September, shortly before the company was acquired by Corixa. Idec, based in San Diego, applied for approval of Zevalin in November.</p>
