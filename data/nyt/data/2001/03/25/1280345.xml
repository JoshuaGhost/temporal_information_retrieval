        <p>No Small Courage</p>
        <p>A History of Women</p>
        <p>in the United States.</p>
        <p>Edited by Nancy F. Cott.</p>
        <p>Oxford University, $35.</p>
        <p>''In much of the Western world's written history, women's presence is minimal,'' Nancy F. Cott writes in the preface to ''No Small Courage.'' This ambitious book examines women's experiences in the New World since Columbus landed, and attempts to demonstrate that newly found perspectives will ''change the historical record altogether.'' Its 10 chapters, written by nine historians under Cott's editorship, look at ''work and leisure, family patterns, political activities, forms of organization and outstanding accomplishments.'' The writers also examine the effect of race and economic class on women's lives. For example, in a section on the colonial Chesapeake region, Jane Kamensky, a historian at Brandeis University, writes, ''Planters' wives were increasingly able to restrict themselves to duties befitting proper English matrons because they enslaved Africans to do the rest of their work.'' In its coverage of the 20th century, ''No Small Courage'' becomes more a history of feminism than of the female experience. The final chapter, for instance, provides details on the divergent views of feminist factions in the 1960's and 70's, and even on countermovements, but offers scant information on the patterns of women's lives during that time. There is little new scholarship, but illuminating and lively personal narratives are interwoven throughout the book. These individual stories help shape this multilayered record, which falls short of painting a complete picture of women in the United States but succeeds in giving a sense of how women have been ''active agents'' in American history, in the words of Cott, who teaches history and American studies at Yale.</p>
